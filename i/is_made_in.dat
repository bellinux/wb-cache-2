Then scenes of Rihanna walking {{on the beach and}} Rihanna curling up on the chair are shown. This is followed by her own and her partner holding each other closely in bed, sitting on different sides of a large bed, and other scenes featuring Rihanna singing through sheer curtains and drapery. In the video there are also black-white scenes showing Rihanna touching to a stone wall.|$|E
5|$|Although Christ, like man, <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> {{the image}} of God, he alone shares the {{likeness}} of God the Father. Christ is both sinless and apathetic, and thus by striving to imitate Christ, man can achieve salvation. To Clement, sin is involuntary, and thus irrational , removed only through {{the wisdom of the}} Logos. God's guidance of us away from sin is thus a manifestation of God's universal love for mankind. The word play on λόγος and αλόγον is characteristic of Clement's writing, and may be rooted in the Epicurean belief that relationships between words are deeply reflective of relationships between the objects they signify.|$|E

5|$|Appliqué art, {{which is}} a stitching-based craft unlike embroidery, was pioneered by Hatta Maharana of Pipili. It is widely used in Puri, both for {{decoration}} of the deities and for sale. Maharana's family members are employed as darjis or tailors or sebaks by the Maharaja of Puri. They prepare articles for decorating the deities in the temple for various festivals and religious ceremonies. The appliqué works are brightly coloured and patterned fabric {{in the form of}} canopies, umbrellas, drapery, carry bags, flags, coverings of dummy horses and cows, and other household textiles; these are marketed in Puri. The cloth used <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> dark colours of red, black, yellow, green, blue and turquoise blue.|$|E

5|$|Few records survive of the Brill Brick and Tile Works, {{as it came}} to be called, but it was {{operational}} by 1895. Jones (1974) {{says the}} siding to the brickworks opened with the extension to Brill, implying that Brill Brick and Tile Works existed in early 1872. This is almost certainly incorrect; no mention of the sidings <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> the Duke of Buckingham's correspondence before 1887 and no reference to the Brill Brick and Tile Works exists in any source earlier than 1895. The bricks used to build Waddesdon Manor had to be shipped by road from Poore's to Brill or along the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway from further afield before being sent down the Tramway to the site, implying there was no works capable of making high numbers of bricks along the Tramway.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle Ages {{there was}} {{considerable}} variation in the nomination of the archbishop and other bishops. At various times the choice {{was made by the}} canons of Canterbury Cathedral, the king of England, or the Pope. Since the Reformation, the church is explicitly a state church and the choice is legally that of the British crown; today it <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> the name of the monarch by the Prime Minister, from a shortlist of two selected by an ad hoc committee called the Crown Nominations Commission.|$|E

5|$|Most 16O is {{synthesized}} {{at the end}} of the helium fusion {{process in}} massive stars but some <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> the neon burning process. 17O is primarily made by the burning of hydrogen into helium during the CNO cycle, making it a common isotope in the hydrogen burning zones of stars. Most 18O is produced when 14N (made abundant from CNO burning) captures a 4He nucleus, making 18O common in the helium-rich zones of evolved, massive stars.|$|E
5|$|Nowadays, most vinegar <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> {{submerged}} tank culture, {{first described}} in 1949 by Otto Hromatka and Heinrich Ebner. In this method, alcohol is fermented to vinegar in a continuously stirred tank, and oxygen is supplied by bubbling air through the solution.

However, if an accurate throw <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> time to complete a double play or triple play, but the fielder on the base fails to make the catch, an error may be charged.|$|E

5|$|Original film {{producer}} Sean S. Cunningham claims that Miller wrote the screenplay for Friday the 13th as a work-made-for-hire for the Manny Company. Under copyright law, an employer {{is considered the}} statutory author and copyright holder if a work <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> the employee's scope of employment. If, as Cunningham contends, Miller wrote the screenplay as the Manny Company's employee, he never held a copyright to the screenplay to transfer or reclaim. A lawsuit seeking the parties' declaration of rights is currently pending in a federal court in Connecticut.|$|E
5|$|Reviews {{have shown}} that water {{fluoridation}} reduces cavities in children. A conclusion for the efficacy in adults is less clear with some reviews finding benefit and others not. Studies in the U.S. in the 1950s and 1960s showed that water fluoridation reduced childhood cavities by fifty to sixty percent, while studies in 1989 and 1990 showed lower reductions (40% and 18% respectively), likely due to increasing use of fluoride from other sources, notably toothpaste, and also the 'halo effect' of food and drink that <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> fluoridated areas and consumed in unfluoridated ones.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known sketch (№ 236) <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> graphite and {{is located}} in the Carl Larsson museum in Sundborn. It was dated by Karl Axel Arvidsson to a time shortly after the visit to Copenhagen in 1910. In July, Larsson started to paint a large version, which was finished in January 1911, but it is only preserved in a photograph. It is based on the early sketch but it presents a richer set of figures in the foreground. The early version was put on display in Nationalmuseum without receiving any official comments. There was no formal order and no official contest had been declared, and the initiative was only Larsson's.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} was well-received in Serbia and abroad; {{it has since}} attained iconic status in Serbian popular culture. An allusion to it <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> Emir Kusturica's 1995 film Underground, in which war refugees are depicted marching towards Belgrade in similar fashion, following the German bombing {{of the city in}} April 1941. Several authors have noted similarities between Jovanović's depiction of the migration and images of other upheavals in Serbian history. Historian Katarina Todić observes that there are striking similarities between the painting and photographs of the Royal Serbian Army's retreat to the Adriatic coast during World War I. Judah remarks that the composition resembles images of the exodus of Krajina Serbs following Croatia's Operation Storm in August 1995.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} making beer is known as brewing. A {{dedicated}} building for the making of beer is called a brewery, though beer {{can be made in}} the home and has been for much of its history. A company that makes beer is called either a brewery or a brewing company. Beer made on a domestic scale for non-commercial reasons is classified as homebrewing regardless of where it is made, though most homebrewed beer <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> the home. Brewing beer is subject to legislation and taxation in developed countries, which from the late 19th century largely restricted brewing to a commercial operation only. However, the UK government relaxed legislation in 1963, followed by Australia in 1972 and the US in 1978, allowing homebrewing to become a popular hobby.|$|E
5|$|The right against exploitation, {{given in}} Articles 23 and 24, {{provides}} for two provisions, namely {{the abolition of}} {{trafficking in human beings}} and Begar (forced labour), and abolition of employment of children below the age of 14 years in dangerous jobs like factories, mines, etc. Child labour is considered a gross violation of the spirit and provisions of the constitution. Begar, practised in the past by landlords, has been declared a crime and is punishable by law. Trafficking in humans for the purpose of slave trade or prostitution is also prohibited by law. An exception <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> employment without payment for compulsory services for public purposes. Compulsory military conscription is covered by this provision.|$|E
