5|$|Only {{three people}} besides the reigning monarch {{at the time}} have {{addressed}} both Houses together {{on more than one}} occasion. Nelson Mandela addressed Members of the Commons and the Lords in 1993 and in 1996 as President of South Africa. Mikhail Gorbachev addressed the Houses as a foreign delegate of the Soviet Union in 1984 and again, in 1993, on behalf of the <b>Inter-Parliamentary</b> <b>Union.</b> Shimon Peres addressed the Houses as Prime Minister of Israel in 1986 and as President in 2008.|$|E
5|$|When the Bahraini {{uprising}} {{started in}} early 2011, Matar joined the protests and gave several interviews to international media. Following government crackdown, {{he and other}} party MPs resigned from Parliament. Due to his activism, Matar was arrested by authorities in May. He was allegedly kept in solitary confinement and subjected to torture while in detention before getting tried before a military court. He was released in August and acquitted of charges in February 2012. His arrest, alleged mistreatment and subsequent release triggered several international reactions by international bodies and NGOs such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, <b>Inter-Parliamentary</b> <b>Union,</b> Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. Following his release, Matar continued his political activism.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{cultural}} factors that reinforce this practice. These include the child's financial future, her dowry, social ties and social status, prevention of premarital sex, extramarital pregnancy and STIs. The arguments against it include interruption of education and loss of employment prospects, and hence economic status, as well as loss of normal childhood and its emotional maturation and social isolation. Child marriage places the girl in a relationship where she is in a major imbalance of power and perpetuates the gender inequality that contributed to the practice in the first place. Also in the case of minors, there are the issues of human rights, non-consensual sexual activity and forced marriage and a 2016 joint report of the WHO and <b>Inter-Parliamentary</b> <b>Union</b> places the two concepts together as Child, Early and Forced Marriage (CEFM), as did the 2014 Girl Summit (see below). In addition the likely pregnancies at a young age are associated with higher medical risks for both mother and child, multiple pregnancies and less access to care with pregnancy being amongst the leading causes of death amongst girls aged 15–19. Girls married under age {{are also more likely to}} be the victims of domestic violence.|$|E
25|$|Four-time Vice-President, World <b>Inter-Parliamentary</b> <b>Union</b> Conference: 1954 (Vienna), 1956 (Bangkok), 1958 (Rio de Janeiro), and 1960 (Tokyo).|$|E
25|$|In 1963 {{he went to}} Yugoslavia for an <b>Inter-Parliamentary</b> <b>Union</b> conference. There he had an {{opportunity}} to view at close hand the operation of the Workers' Councils. He was deeply impressed by the level of open debate that he found at these councils, and this experience was to aid him in later years.|$|E
25|$|He is also {{a member}} of the Canada-U.S. Inter-Parliamentary Group and has served as the {{vice-president}} of the Canadian group of the <b>Inter-Parliamentary</b> <b>Union</b> where he took part in conferences in Moscow and New York. He was also part of the Canadian delegation sent to two annual meetings of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in London.|$|E
25|$|Vaz {{has held}} {{a variety of}} {{parliamentary}} posts. Between 1987 and 1992, {{he was a member}} of the Home Affairs Select Committee, of which he was the Chair from July 2007 to September 2016. Between 1993 and 1994, {{he was a member of}} the Executive Committee <b>Inter-Parliamentary</b> <b>Union.</b> Finally, between December 2002 and July 2007, Vaz acted as a senior Labour Member of the Select Committee for Constitutional Affairs.|$|E
25|$|Women {{have since}} {{obtained}} greater {{representation in the}} public sphere. According to the <b>Inter-Parliamentary</b> <b>Union,</b> 30% of seats in Somalia's Federal Parliament are legally reserved for women. This quota was secured by Somali parliamentary consultant Hodan Ahmed and women political leaders. Ahmed had also helped form the Somali Women Parliamentary Association in 2009 in the preceding Transitional Federal Parliament. In November 2012, Prime Minister Shirdon likewise appointed two women to the Cabinet, Fowsiyo Yussuf Haji Aadan as the nation's first female Minister of Foreign Affairs and Maryam Qassim as Minister of Social Development.|$|E
25|$|After {{experiencing}} a recession in support {{due to the}} resurgence of militarism during the American Civil War and Crimean War, the movement began to spread across Europe and began to infiltrate the new working class socialist movements. In 1870, Randal Cremer formed the Workman's Peace Association in London. Cremer, alongside the French economist Frédéric Passy was also the founding father of the first international organisation for the arbitration of conflicts in 1889, the <b>Inter-Parliamentary</b> <b>Union.</b> The National Peace Council was founded in after the 17th Universal Peace Congress in London (July August 1908).|$|E
25|$|In 1990, {{he again}} joined the foreign ministry, and guided Pakistan Muslim League on foreign {{policies}} issues. In 1996, he presided the party delegation and visited People's Republic of China (PRC). This delegation was invited by the Communist Party of China (CPC) and was {{received by the}} top leadership of the CPC. He has also attended the <b>Inter-Parliamentary</b> <b>Union</b> conferences held in Seoul and in Cairo in 1997 as a chairman of the Pakistan Parliamentary Delegations. In 1998, he publicly endorsed for Prime minister Navaz Sharif's decision for atomic tests (See: Chagai-I and Chagai-II) and was appointed as Prime Minister's Special Envoy (PMSE) to present his country's point of view, while backing the rationale of country's nuclear response. He subsequently visited many countries to gather the support for country's nuclear testing programme, including Russia, United States, Canada, China, France, United Kingdom, and other important countries in the world.|$|E
25|$|LTTE had {{developed}} a large international network {{since the days of}} N. S. Krishnan, who served as its first international representative. In the late 1970s, TULF parliamentarian and opposition leader A. Amirthalingam provided letters of reference for fundraising, and V. N. Navaratnam, who was an executive committee member of the <b>Inter-Parliamentary</b> <b>Union</b> (IPU), introduced many influential and wealthy Tamils living overseas to Tamil insurgent leaders. Navaratnam also introduced LTTE members to the members of Polisario Front, a national liberation movement in Morocco, at a meeting held in Oslo, Norway. In 1978, during the world tour of Amirthalingam (with London-based Eelam activist S. K. Vaikundavasan), he formed the World Tamil Coordinating Committee (WTCC), which was later found to be an LTTE front organisation. The global contacts of LTTE grew steadily since then. At the height of its power, LTTE had 42 offices worldwide. The international network of LTTE engages in propaganda, fundraising, arms procurement, and shipping.|$|E
25|$|International legislation. This {{approach}} involves {{promotion of}} the future holding of a binding international convention (perhaps {{to be under the}} auspices of such international organizations as the United Nations or <b>Inter-Parliamentary</b> <b>Union)</b> to formally agree upon an official international auxiliary language which would then be taught in all schools around the world, beginning at the primary level. This approach, an official principle of the Baha'i Faith, seeks to put a combination of international opinion, linguistic expertise, and law behind a to-be-selected language and thus expand or consolidate it as a full official world language, to be used in addition to local languages. This approach could either give more credibility to a natural language already serving this purpose to a certain degree (e.g. if English were chosen) or to give a greatly enhanced chance for a constructed language to take root. For constructed languages particularly, this approach has been seen by various individuals in the IAL movement as holding the most promise of ensuring that promotion of studies in the language would not be met with skepticism at its practicality by its would-be learners.|$|E
500|$|He {{was not a}} {{frequent}} speaker in parliament but he chaired several committees {{and was a member}} of the <b>Inter-Parliamentary</b> <b>Union</b> before the First World War. Hansard, the printed record of parliamentary debates, [...] records that his first parliamentary contribution related to schools in orphan homes, and his last to the health of troops in Palestine.|$|E
500|$|It {{might also}} be {{possible}} to use and/or transform the <b>Inter-Parliamentary</b> <b>Union</b> (IPU), which was granted observer status in 2002. The IPU's Second World Conference of Speakers of Parliament adopted a resolution stating, [...] "We would greatly welcome more substantive interaction and coordination with the United Nations, and call upon the world body to resort more frequently to the political and technical expertise which the IPU together with its Member Parliaments can provide." [...] Moreover, a 2005 article by IPU Secretary-General Anders B. Johnsson stated that, [...] "It makes little practical or political sense {{to set up a}} separate parliamentary assembly alongside the existing governmental General Assembly." [...] Indeed, the <b>Inter-Parliamentary</b> <b>Union</b> seems to favor a reformed IPU as a substitute for a UNPA, saying, [...] "The Union had the necessary experience, and further bureaucracy should be avoided." [...] Many national parliaments, however, are currently not members of the IPU.|$|E
500|$|Supporters {{have set}} forth {{possible}} UNPA implementations, including promulgation {{of a new}} treaty; creation of a UNPA as a subsidiary body of the UN General Assembly; and evolution of a UNPA from the <b>Inter-Parliamentary</b> <b>Union</b> or another non-governmental organization. Several proposals for apportionment of votes have been raised to address disparities in UN members' population and economic power. CEUNPA advocates initially giving the UNPA advisory powers and gradually increasing its authority over the UN system.|$|E
500|$|Matar said he {{though the}} purpose of the arrest was to {{pressure}} Al Wefaq. Analysts speculated that the release was [...] "an attempt at defusing tensions in the country". The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed concern over the alleged mistreatment of Matar, alleged absence of access to lawyer and guarantees for a fair trial. The <b>Inter-Parliamentary</b> <b>Union</b> expressed concern that by October 2012, authorities had not started prosecuting those behind the alleged mistreatment of Matar and Fairooz.|$|E
500|$|Another {{possibility}} is establishing the UNPA as a subsidiary {{body of the}} UN General Assembly. The General Assembly has authority to do this under Article 22 of the UN Charter. Erskine Childers and Sir Brian Urquhart endorsed this approach in their 1994 book, Renewing the United Nations System. The Committee for a Democratic UN also recommended the establishment of UNPA by Article 22 or by transformation of the <b>Inter-Parliamentary</b> <b>Union</b> in its report, Developing International Democracy, authored by Andreas Bummel, co-founder {{and director of the}} UNPA campaign. In 2006, the Council of Europe passed a resolution noting, [...] "A decisive step towards the development of a UN parliamentary dimension could be the establishment of an experimental parliamentary committee with consultative functions for General Assembly committees." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{forerunner of}} the League of Nations, the <b>Inter-Parliamentary</b> <b>Union</b> (IPU), {{was formed by}} the peace activists William Randal Cremer and Frédéric Passy in 1889 (and is {{currently}} still in existence as an international body {{with a focus on}} the various elected legislative bodies of the world.) [...] The IPU was founded with an international scope, with a third of the members of parliaments (in the 24 countries that had parliaments) serving as members of the IPU by 1914. Its foundational aims were to encourage governments to solve international disputes by peaceful means. Annual conferences were established to help governments refine the process of international arbitration. Its structure was designed as a council headed by a president, which would later be reflected {{in the structure of the}} League.|$|E
500|$|The {{government}} of Bahrain denied that Matar {{had been kept}} in solitary confinement. They said the [...] "information concerning the disappearance of Mr. Matar following his arrest is not correct" [...] {{and that they had}} followed international human rights standards. They added that Matar was allowed to contact his family and lawyer, and that his [...] "legal safeguards were ensured" [...] according to local law. They also noted that Matar had lost his parliamentary immunity following the acceptance of his resignation on 29 March. They however did not address the allegations of mistreatment nor did they provide other information requested by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights such as the results of investigation and medical examinations. Also, Kassoum Tapo, the president of the Committee on human rights of parliamentarians of the <b>Inter-Parliamentary</b> <b>Union</b> insisted that Matar had been a parliamentarian [...] "at the time of the demonstrations and of [...] arrest." ...|$|E
500|$|Kroonland {{also carried}} some notable {{passengers}} during her {{time on this}} route including {{a majority of the}} U.S. delegates to the International Chamber of Commerce for its meeting in Paris in June 1920. Among those on board were Myron T. Herrick, former U.S. Ambassador to France; Paul M. Warburg, former member of the Federal Reserve Board; and 14 current and former directors of the United States Chamber of Commerce. Dr. Samuel Eyde, the newly appointed Norwegian Minister to the United States, sailed for his diplomatic post in December on Kroonland. On the same trip, Max Goldberg, a 14-year-old flower delivery boy, returned from an accidental roundtrip, begun in New York when the [...] was raised and the ship departed while he was making a last-minute delivery. Four of the United States' seven delegates to the 19th <b>Inter-Parliamentary</b> <b>Union</b> Convention in Stockholm—Congressmen Alben W. Barkley and Edwin B. Brooks, and Senators Thomas J. Walsh and William B. McKinley—returned on Kroonland in September 1921.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Inter-Parliamentary</b> <b>Union</b> President Theo-Ben Gurirab said he {{strongly}} condemns the [...] "coup d'état" [...] in Madagascar, {{saying that}} any unconstitutional action overthrowing a government is fundamentally flawed and completely unacceptable.

2500|$|During {{the earlier}} {{years of the}} SNM, [...] Mohamoud {{established}} offices and organized SNM committees throughout Europe, North America, and the Arab world to raise international awareness of the liberation movement and the brutality of Somalia’s Siyad Barre regime against its own people through presentations to international human rights groups, the press media, various European government bodies, including the British Parliament and the European <b>Inter-Parliamentary</b> <b>Union,</b> and relevant organizations in the Arab and Islamic world.|$|E
2500|$|Bhutto also {{ratcheted}} up her {{policy on}} Indian Kashmir, rallying against India. At an <b>Inter-Parliamentary</b> <b>Union</b> {{meeting at the}} United Nations, Bhutto, who was accompanied by her Speaker Yousaf Raza Gillani upset and angered the Indian delegation, headed by prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, with a vehement criticism of India. Vajpayee responded, saying: [...] "It is Pakistan which is flouting the United Nations resolution by not withdrawing its forces from Kashmir...You people create problems every time. You know the Kashmiri people themselves acceded to India. First, the Maharajah, then the Kashmiri parliament, both decided to go with India".|$|E
2500|$|Never an isolationist, he {{supported}} using American influence abroad {{on behalf of}} democracy or for national independence or against autocracy. Thus {{he supported}} the Irish independence movement and the anti-czarist Russian Revolution of 1917, but did not approve of Vladimir Lenin. [...] Unlike most progressive colleagues, such as Norris, La Guardia consistently backed internationalism, speaking {{in favor of the}} League of Nations and the <b>Inter-Parliamentary</b> <b>Union</b> as well as peace and disarmament conferences. In domestic policies he tended toward socialism and wanted to nationalize and regulate; however he was never close to the Socialist Party and never bothered to read Karl Marx.|$|E
2500|$|Ralea {{eventually}} {{affiliated with}} the centrist current of the PNȚ, distancing himself from those party factions who were tempted by socialism. Ralea and Ibrăileanu still promoted {{the vision of a}} [...] "peasant state", accepting socialist reformism, but still cautious of socialist industrialization, and rejecting outright the idea of proletarian primacy. Criticized by the communist left as [...] "outstanding shortsightedness", this ideological position came to define the PNȚ in the mid 1930s. Ralea defended classical parliamentarianism at several <b>Inter-Parliamentary</b> <b>Union</b> meetings, including the 1933 conference in the Republic of Spain, but insisted on the benefits of statism and a planned economy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{drafting}} process included six {{expert group}} meetings, held in Singapore, Egypt, Costa Rica, Spain, Turkey, and the U.S. The {{final version of}} the Child Protection Model Law was published in January 2013.

[...] It was also presented before the 129th Assembly of the <b>Inter-Parliamentary</b> <b>Union</b> (IPU) in Geneva in October 2013. [...] Accompanying the Child Protection Model Law, ICMEC and The Protection Project published a companion [...] "100 Best Practices in Child Protection" [...] guide in 2013.|$|E
2500|$|When acting U.S. {{ambassador}} William Trueheart {{warned that}} development aid might be withheld if the repression orchestrated by the Ngôs continued, Madame Nhu denounced it as [...] "blackmail". Nhu and Diệm, fearing {{a cut in}} aid, sent Madame Nhu to the United States on a speaking tour. She departed South Vietnam on 9 September 1963 in an expedition that brought widespread international scorn to her family's regime. She had predicted [...] "a triumphant lecture tour". She left on 17 September for the <b>Inter-Parliamentary</b> <b>Union</b> meeting in Yugoslavia, followed by a trip to Italy and possibly to the United States, where she had an invitation to speak before the Overseas Press Club of New York.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{no longer}} holding {{a seat in}} Parliament, Streitman was one of Romania's delegates to the 25th <b>Inter-Parliamentary</b> <b>Union</b> Conference, while also {{representing}} Romania within a journalists' version of the Little Entente, alongside Filotti and Emil Fagure. He also remained active as an adviser of the Romanian far-right. In his own pamphlet, Mustul care fierbe ("The Boiling Must"), Octavian Goga paid homage to Streitman as the [...] "fine analyst". Goga cited his admiration for Streitman against those who reproached him his antisemitism: [...] "I have never professed that stupid kind of intolerance." [...] At the time, Streitman also advised and financed his friend Șeicaru {{to set up the}} nationalist daily, Curentul. In its original edition, this political tribune employed other Jewish men of letters, among them F. Brunea-Fox and Moses Rosen. In 1930, Streitman launched a new magazine of his own, the short-lived Observatorul Politic și Social ("Political and Social Observer").|$|E
