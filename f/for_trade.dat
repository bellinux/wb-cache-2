5|$|Congress {{considered}} {{raising the}} five-dollar legal tender limit on trade dollars, but instead {{passed a bill}} that officially demonetized the trade dollar on July 22, 1876; the Secretary of the Treasury was directed by the act to strike no more of the coins than necessary for use in trade. Despite the demonetization of the trade dollar, bullion producers continued to place the coins into the American market, resulting in an estimated seven million coins circulating within the United States, of which more than four million were placed in circulation in 1877. Despite the 1876 act, {{it was not until}} October 15, 1877 that Sherman (now Secretary of the Treasury) finally ordered that the mints not accept orders <b>for</b> <b>trade</b> dollars. On November 5, apparently believing a false report that additional supplies were needed for the Chinese New Year, he rescinded his order, finally ending orders <b>for</b> <b>trade</b> dollars on February 22, 1878.|$|E

5|$|The Motagua River flows {{down from}} the western Guatemalan highlands, and Quiriguá was ideally {{positioned}} to control the trade of uncut jade, the majority of which {{was found in the}} middle reaches of the Motagua Valley, as well as controlling the flow of other important commodities up and down the river such as cacao, which was produced as a local cash crop. Although cacao was produced <b>for</b> <b>trade,</b> maize remained the primary local crop due to its central role in the Maya diet. In addition, maize probably formed an important component in the site's tribute payments to its overlords at Copán, a city that was exhausting its own local resources.
