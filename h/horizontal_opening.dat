50|$|The {{combination}} of the antennae in this way resulted in a concentration of the radiated energy to a smaller beam, thus resulting in a higher radiated power in the main direction (Effective Radiated Power = ERP), without increasing the transmitter power. The result was a longer range. With the L-version the <b>horizontal</b> <b>opening</b> angle of the antenna array remained the same, but the vertical opening angle was reduced (so flatter radiation pattern). Because the <b>horizontal</b> <b>opening</b> angle was not changed, the bearing measuring performance was not changed.

40|$|AbstractThe size of air-inlets in fire scene {{influences}} the air entrainment, {{and the power}} of air entrainment has an obvious effect on the formation and the combustion characteristic of fire whirls. In order to study the air-inlet influence on fire whirl combustion characteristic, the experiment in this work used the fire whirl generator with six free-setting <b>horizontal</b> <b>openings</b> to simulate different size of air-inlets in fire scene.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an adaptive finite impulse response (FIR) equalizer with continuous-time wide-bandwidth delay line in CMOS 0. 25 - m process for 2. 5 -Gb/s to 3. 5 -Gb/s data communications. To achieve wide bandwidth, fractionally spaced structure is used and an inverter with active-inductor load design is proposed as the delay cell of the tap delay line. Close loop {{adaptation of the}} fractionally spaced FIR equalizer is demonstrated using a low-power and area-efficient pulse extraction method as on-chip error detector. Measurement {{results show that the}} proposed adaptive equalizer achieves over 75 % <b>horizontal</b> eye <b>opening</b> when the channel loss at the half-data-rate frequency varies from 4 dB to 21 dB at 2. 5 -Gb/s data rate. At 3. 5 -Gb/s data rate, the equalizer achieves 68 % <b>horizontal</b> eye <b>opening</b> when the channel loss is about 9. 3 dB at the half-data-rate frequency. The adaptive equalizer including the FIR filter and the error detector occupies 0. 095 mmP die area and dissipates 95 mW at 2. 5 -Gb/s data rate from 2. 5 -V voltage supply.

The city of Detroit continues to work hard at its revival and renaissance begun in the 1990s and Detroit Beer Co. has become a part that revival, as well. Detroit Beer Co. is housed in the historic 100-year-old Hartz Building at 1529 Broadway Street; {{it is part of the}} Broadway Avenue Historic District located on a single block along Broadway Avenue between Gratiot and East Grand River. The Hartz building is in the center of a cultural and sporting spot in Detroit, with the Detroit Opera house standing across the street, and Comerica Park and Ford Field both short walks away. The six-story Hartz building was built in 1902; it was named after J. Frederick Hartz, who was Chairman of the Board of the J.F. Hartz Company, a medical and surgical supply company. Malcomson & Higginbotham, architects, 1902. J. Frederick Hartz, the namesake of this building, was Chairman of the board of the J.F. Hartz Company, suppliers of medical supplies and surgical instruments for physicians, nurses, hospitals and sick rooms. Malcomson and Higginson, architects, were issued the building permit for the construction of the building for Hartz. It was to cost an estimated $15,000. Also located in the Hartz Building in 1907 were Silverman Bernd, cigar manufacturer; the Detroit Medical JournalCompany; E.C.

40|$|Drilling and {{blasting}} {{continues to}} be the predominant rock excavation technique in driving <b>horizontal</b> <b>openings</b> and tunnels for underground construction purpose. Faster drivages, attempted these days for reducing the long gestation periods of projects, have often resulted in large overbreak. This is due to the unacceptable levels of ground vibration to which the rock is subjected. Factors contributing to this include longer pulls; burn cuts, higher explosive per hole and per delay etc. Blast-induced rock damage (BIRD) assessment based on far-field peak particle velocity (PPV) measurement, when extrapolated near the face, has often resulted in suggesting higher PPV threshold levels. Apart from this the geological and structural features play a dominant role in masking the intensity of blast waves. Therefore, near-filed monitoring using accelerometers has been attempted in one of the metal mines to study the blast damage in faces excavated by burn cut. Present seismographs available have limited range (2540 mm/s) and are not suitable for near-field monitoring. This paper reports the investigations carried out for measuring acceleration, PPV and overbreak in a development heading for arriving at a suitable method of predicting blast-induced rock damage. The analysis of both acceleration and PPV measured against overbreak has revealed that rock damage is found to depend more on acceleration than PPV...|$|R
