40|$|For various historical, practical, and {{foundational}} reasons, {{large parts}} of mathematics are studied indirectly via countable approximations, also called codes. It is a natural question whether this <b>indirect</b> <b>study</b> of codes is faithful to the original development in mathematics, or whether approximations somehow distort the latter. Another natural question is which parts of basic mathematics can(not) be studied via these representations. In this paper, we formulate new answers to these old questions. Our answers stem both from mathematics itself (via {{the study of the}} gauge integral) and its foundations (via Hilbert-Bernays' Grundlagen der Mathematik and its spiritual successor Reverse Mathematics). We identify a number of basic theorems from (uncountable) mathematics for which the logical and computational properties are completely (and even maximally) distorted upon introducing countable approximations. In a nutshell, while countable approximations are interesting and important, even extremely basic 'uncountable' mathematics is infinitely more complicated than the 'countable picture' involving codes suggests.

40|$|We develop {{expressions}} for {{the power}} to detect associations between parental genotypes and offspring phenotypes for quantitative traits. Three different "indirect" experimental designs are considered: full-sib, half-sib, and full-sib-half-sib families. We compare the power of these designs to detect genotype-phenotype associations relative to the common, "direct," approach of genotyping and phenotyping the same individuals. When heritability is low, the indirect designs can outperform the direct method. However, the extra power comes at a cost due to an increased phenotyping effort. By developing expressions for optimal experimental designs given the cost of phenotyping relative to genotyping, we show how the extra costs associated with phenotyping {{a large number of}} individuals will influence experimental design decisions. Our result,; suggest that <b>indirect</b> association <b>studies</b> can be a powerful means of detecting allelic associations in outbred populations of species for which genotyping and phenotyping the same individuals is impractical and for life history and behavioral traits that are heavily influenced by environmental variance and therefore best measured on groups of individuals. <b>Indirect</b> association <b>studies</b> are likely to be favored only on purely economical grounds, however, when phenotyping is substantially less expensive than genotyping.

Differences between Mass Spectrometer and Incoherent Scatter and ESR estimates are found to vary with altitude, season, and magnetic disturbance, with the largest discrepancies during the winter months.

One postfire study compared several ant species in pre-fire samples to postfire samples collected three years later in coastal sage scrub, chaparral, grassland, and riparian woodland (Matsuda et al. 2011). Populations of only two of the eight ant species changed significantly. These were in coastal sage scrub and had opposite responses: Crematogaster californica Wheeler numbers decreased from 21 % to 2 %, while the harvester ant (M. andrei) increased from < 1 % in pre-fire vegetation to 32 % after fire. It follows that these two species may be specialized species as evidenced by their response to changes in the habitat structure that resulted from the fire.|$|R

The results revealed a rather constant E A in the range of 1. 4 to 1. 5 [*]eV, independent of the deposition temperature. The reaction rate, however, was found to increase with decreasing deposition temperature, which correlates with an increasing amount of hydrogen being incorporated in the Al 2 O 3 films.

40|$|Microsatellites {{are widely}} used in genetic and {{evolutionary}} analyses, but their own evolution is far from simple. The mechanisms maintaining the mutational patterns of simple repeats and the typical stable allele-frequency distributions are still poorly understood. Asexual lineages may provide particularly informative models for the <b>indirect</b> <b>study</b> of microsatellite evolution, because their genomes act as complete linkage groups, with mutations being {{the only source of}} genetic variation. Here, we study the direction of accumulated dinucleotide microsatellite mutations in wild asexual lineages of hexaploid Ranunculus carpaticola. Whereas the overall number of contractions is not significantly different from that of expansions, the within-locus frequency of contractions, but not of expansions, significantly increases with allele length. Moreover, within-locus polymorphism is positively correlated with allele length, but this relationship is due solely to the influence of contraction mutations. Such asymmetries may explain length constraints generally observed with microsatellites and are consistent with stable, bell-shaped allele-frequency distributions. Although apomictic and allohexaploid, the R. carpaticola lineages show mutational patterns resembling the trends observed in a broad range of organisms, including sexuals and diploids, suggesting that, even if not of germline origin, the mutations in these apomicts may be the consequence of similar mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Relatedness and {{autonomy}} are valued {{ways of being}} in cultures of interdependence and independence, respectively. How does culture contact with independence through globalization and migration affect the self in interdependent cultures? Taking a perspective from acculturation, we propose conditional compatibility of high relatedness with high autonomy in the acculturating self. We argue that compatibility or conflict between relatedness {{and autonomy}} depends on (1) different modes of indirect (globalization-driven) vs. direct (migration-related) acculturation, and on (2) individual differences in acculturation strategies (bicultural integration vs. separation or assimilation). Two studies (Ns = 152 and 125) compare relatedness and autonomy across (interdependent) Turkish and (more independent) Belgian cultures, distinguishing <b>indirect</b> (<b>Study</b> 1 with Turkish university students in Turkey) from direct acculturation contexts (Study 2 with Turkish immigrants in Belgium). As expected, Turkish students in Study 1 were more highly related than Belgians, yet equally autonomous; and their relatedness was compatible with autonomy. While Turkish immigrants in Study 2 were also more related, they were less autonomous than Belgians; and relatedness was in conflict with autonomy. Moreover, compatibility or conflict varied with immigrants’ acculturation strategies, so that integration uniquely predicted compatibility. In conclusion, autonomy can be compatible with relatedness when ecologies and strategies of acculturation afford the combination of interdependence and independence. status: accepte...|$|E
