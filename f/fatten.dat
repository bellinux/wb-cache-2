For the same reason, the ruff does not physiologically shrink its digestive organs to reduce bodyweight before migrating, unlike the godwit.|$|E

5|$|In July, {{the diet}} {{switches}} increasingly to fruit. The protein needed for egg-laying {{and for the}} chicks to grow is replaced by fruit sugar which helps the birds to <b>fatten</b> for migration.

Blackcaps eat {{a wide range of}} small fruit, and squeeze out any seeds on a branch before consuming the pulp. This technique makes them an important propagator of mistletoe. The mistle thrush, which also favours that plant, is less beneficial since it tends to crush the seeds.

5|$|The Egyptians {{believed}} that a balanced relationship between people and animals was {{an essential element of}} the cosmic order; thus humans, animals and plants were believed to be members of a single whole. Animals, both domesticated and wild, were therefore a critical source of spirituality, companionship, and sustenance to the ancient Egyptians. Cattle were the most important livestock; the administration collected taxes on livestock in regular censuses, and the size of a herd reflected the prestige and importance of the estate or temple that owned them. In addition to cattle, the ancient Egyptians kept sheep, goats, and pigs. Poultry, such as ducks, geese, and pigeons, were captured in nets and bred on farms, where they were force-fed with dough to <b>fatten</b> them. The Nile provided a plentiful source of fish.

Live ultrasound measurements were performed to determine back fat thickness. Carcass dressing percentage, carcass conformation and fatness, intramuscular fat content of m. longissimus dorsi and fatty acid profile (by gas chromatography) were determined after slaughter.

Bulls were five months old when the research commenced and they were eleven months old when the reserch was terminated. All body dimensions were measured by Litin stick except for breast circuit, metacarpus circuit and body weight. Bulls were tied and remained at the same place during their <b>fattening</b> period staying in ordinary cow-shed made of brick. All height measures increased at the relatively equal pace during the <b>fattening</b> period. Withers height increased most and back height increased the least. Tenderness of the back appeared to be most prominent at the end of <b>fattening</b> period. Concerning length dimensions, body length developed quickest, head length slowest. As far as body width of bulls is considered the fastest growth was recorded concerning pelvis breadth; head front breadth increased the least. Breast depth was most notable at the point of bulls entering the category of very good condition during their <b>fattening</b> process.

The research was carried out on 57 <b>fattening</b> pigs of both sex, divided into two groups by their housing. Each group consisted of pigs of two genotypes, i. e. three-way crossbreeds of Large White and German Landrace (LW x GL) in the dam line, and of German Landrace and 8 Pietrain (P) in the sire line. Pigs were fed ad libitum with isocaloric and isoprotein diets. During the whole experiment, temperature, air moisture, air circulation speed and the content of NH 3 and CO 2 were measured in pens. No statistically significant differences were recorded with respect to temperature, air moisture, air circulation speed and content of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and ammonia (NH 3) in the air in pens with deep litter and without it (P> 0. 05). Pigs housed without deep litter had statistically highly significant (P< 0. 01) higher final weights than pigs kept on deep litter. Pigs crossed with Pietrain as a terminal breed, kept in pens without deep litter, had statistically significantly higher (P< 0. 05) average daily gains than pigs of the same genotype kept on deep litter.
