25|$|Locomotive : This {{pattern is}} {{produced}} {{when all the}} planets are contained within 240 degrees or nine signs of the zodiac, so that a whole 120 degrees is completely unoccupied. The planet that rises clockwise following the empty space will significantly influence {{the life of the}} person with this pattern, no matter what is indicated by the sun sign. It will act as the 'locomotive' of the natal chart, driving the individual to achieve goals through determined and unrelenting effort, with an exceptional drive and fund of energy at their disposal. Such a person will often be a loner, waiting for the public to discover the truth of what they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> all along.|$|E
500|$|The Nazi in {{this episode}} {{appears to be}} Reichsführer of the Schutzstaffel, Heinrich Himmler. Aside from looking like the character, Himmler was also both a Nordicist and a Nazi Occultist. At {{one point in the}} episode, a scared elderly woman points at him screaming, [...] "It's him... it's him...!" [...] This has a double meaning, as she could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "It's him!" [...] or she could have been trying to say [...] "It's Himmler!" ...|$|E
500|$|Stanley was a {{powerful}} orator who used dramatic flourishes to emphasize his points. He would often loosen his tie before he ever started speaking, {{and by the end}} of his speech have thrown off his vest and coat. In one instance, the candidates debated a tax on dog owners of one dollar per dog. Stanley favored the tax, while Morrow contended that everyone should be allowed one dog tax-free. Stanley ridiculed the idea as [...] "Free Old Dog Ring," [...] and sometimes howled like a dog in speeches deriding the proposal. On another occasion Stanley, who had too much to drink, vomited in front of the audience as Morrow spoke. When Stanley took the podium, he remarked, [...] "That just goes to show you what I <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> all over Kentucky. Ed Morrow plain makes me sick to my stomach." ...|$|E

500|$|Wolf of Anime UK News {{originally}} said of {{the scene}} that: [...] "I'm 99.999% sure the kiss did occur, but that 0.001% is horribly getting to me. I don't want to go by what everyone else sees – I {{want to see what}} is actually going on, and share in the reaction of the characters {{at the same time as}} them". However, by the twelfth episode, he said that the scene in which Victor cries was the proof he wanted: [...] "If the kiss is the initial spark, and the rings the visible sign of love, then the tears are proof that you don't want it to end. I <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> all the time that what I wanted was text rather than subtext – but in end, I think the subtext did actually pay off." ...|$|E
500|$|Tim Sendra of Allmusic {{gave the}} album {{three out of}} five stars review, and said the album had the [...] "cheesy drum machines, samples, and off-kilter lyric {{approach}} that make [...] "Jerk" [...] so good", [...] "the duo stick to the template , considering {{the uniqueness of the}} sound they've created and also the fact that it's a debut record made by teenagers, and an impressive and unfailingly fun debut at that." [...] The review goes on to point out that [...] "the reliance on the [...] "Jerk" [...] sound can be a little monotonous, there are enough variations along the way to keep things interesting." [...] He also says [...] "The duo's flow is not incredible but they spit convincingly. If you were looking for undisputedly pop-rap with a fresh sound and a light lyrical touch, the New Boyz debut is a fine destination." [...] XXL said that the album delivered [...] "unexpected lyrical talent" [...] but that it lacked [...] "sonic variety". The review also {{goes on to say that}} the album [...] "is no hip-hop classic, but rather the breath of fresh air rap needs." [...] Jeff Weiss of The Los Angeles Times gave the album three stars, commenting that the album [...] "is a catchy and charismatic debut that should engender pleasant teen nostalgia in anyone old enough to vote and help explain why for the last six months, the kids <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> out with the old, in with the New Boyz.". The review also said that the album [...] "successfully strikes a balance between introducing a new sound (the minimalist bass-heavy bounce of jerk music) and style (skinny jeans, Vans and [...] "colors that ain’t even on the rainbow"), with traditional teenage themes (girls, the desire for self-expression, adults who don’t understand, girls). The result is a West Coast antidote to the South’s veritable monopoly on homeroom rap—a relentlessly breezy and fun ride through the lives of a pair of class clowns bent on enjoying the face cards that fate dealt." [...] The Selby Times said that the album [...] "is about as happening as it gets for teenage music with an attitude, even if it makes adults' eyes roll in disgust." [...] Wendy Roby of BBC said that, [...] "But overall their sheer chutzpah wins you over – and with its day-glo tongue wedged so very firmly in its cheek, Skinny Jeanz and a Mic is hard to resist." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called the album [...] "one of the year’s most charming rap debuts, and certainly the least expected." [...] In a separate review, he named the album the sixth best album of the year, commenting, [...] "Emerging from Southern California’s jerk scene, this teenage duo made an album that’s appealingly young, simultaneously wide-eyed and knowingly lewd." [...] DJBooth.net's Nathan Slavik was less positive, predicting that the album would be [...] "the last time we hear from the New Boyz." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2017, Coogan {{endorsed}} Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn in the 2017 UK general election. He {{opened for}} Corbyn {{at a rally}} in Birmingham saying: [...] "The Tory tactic was to try to make this a choice between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn, but this has backfired as people - and I readily admit to being one of them - have started to listen to what Jeremy Corbyn says rather than what other people <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> about him." ...|$|E

2500|$|A Democratic Progressive Party {{legislator}} in Taiwan, Yu Tien made offensive comments regarding Muslims, {{claiming they}} were a [...] "light hearted joke", linking terrorism to Muslims while campaigning. His wife had {{said she was a}} “Muslim terrorist early on … like Osama bin Laden.” Yu replied: “People <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> that I am afraid of my wife. Faced with such a Muslim militant, how could I not be afraid?” He then apologized after the incident, saying he was [...] "Deeply apologetic", and [...] "We weren’t trying to connect Muslims with terrorists and we hope the public doesn’t misunderstand us. We respect every religion.” ...|$|E
2500|$|When a {{resident}} of Summit Creek (now Smithfield) found his horse missing, he accused a young Shoshone fishing in nearby Summit Creek of having stolen the animal. Robert Thornley, an English immigrant and first resident of Summit Creek, defended the young Indian and testified for him. [...] Nonetheless, a jury of locals convicted him and hanged him for stealing the horse. [...] Local history recorded the Shoshone's name as Pugweenee. [...] Later information reveals that Pugweenee is the Shoshone word for [...] "fish" [...] and so the man may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "Look at my fish," [...] or [...] "I was just fishing." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1999, Zemeckis donated $5 million {{towards the}} Robert Zemeckis Center for Digital Arts at USC, a [...] center. When the Center opened in March 2001, Zemeckis {{spoke in a}} panel {{about the future of}} film, {{alongside}} friends Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. Of those (including Spielberg) who clung to celluloid and disparaged the idea of shooting digitally, Zemeckis said, [...] "These guys are the same ones who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> that LPs sound better than CDs. You can argue that until you're blue in the face, but I don't know anyone who's still buying vinyl. Film, as we have traditionally thought of it, is going to be different. But the continuum is man's desire to tell stories around the campfire. The only thing that keeps changing is the campfire." [...] The Robert Zemeckis Center currently hosts many film school classes, much of the Interactive Media Division, and Trojan Vision, USC's student television station, which has been voted the number one college television station in the country.|$|E
2500|$|The Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, {{announced}} that he had with regret accepted the resignations of Bishops Burnham and Newton. The Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales gave assurance of a warm welcome for those who wished to be part of an ordinariate. In a pastoral letter concerning his resignation as Bishop of Richborough, Newton stressed that he had done so not for [...] "negative reasons about problems in the Church of England but for positive reasons in response to our Lord's prayer the night before he died, [...] 'they may all be one'." [...] Ruth Gledhill, religious affairs correspondent of The Times, said that the announcement could prompt [...] "hundreds, possibly thousands" [...] of lay ministers to follow the bishops' example. She added: [...] "It's quite significant as it means the ordinariate – that quite a few people <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> might not get off the ground – could be {{a force to be reckoned}} with.".|$|E
2500|$|... "Hole in the Head", {{the number}} one single from the Sugababes' third studio album Three (2003), was {{released}} in the United States during July 2004. During this time, the Sugababes revealed that they would meet with producers in the US {{to work on their}} fourth studio album. In August 2004, the Sugababes released [...] "Caught in a Moment", the fourth and final single from Three, and also confirmed that recording for the group's fourth album had commenced. During their break between September 2004 and August 2005, speculation arose about the band's future, which included rumours of a greatest hits album being released and that the group would later split. Band member Heidi Range expressed her distaste with the media speculation, saying: [...] "You know what? At first it would make us angry, then we'd laugh it off and now we don't even pay any attention to it. The tabloids <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> we're about to split since I joined the band four years ago and I've no idea where it all comes from." ...|$|E

In November 2005, the UN body's report singled out Montreal police for the disproportionate use of mass arrests, stating: [...] "The State party should ensure that the right of persons to peacefully participate in social protests is respected, and ensure that only those committing criminal offences during demonstrations are arrested ... The Committee also invites the State party to conduct an inquiry into the practices of the Montreal police forces during demonstrations, and wishes to receive more detail about the practical implementation of article 63 of the Criminal Code relating to unlawful assembly." [...] Singh cited the results of the report as a vindication for Montreal activists: [...] "The report validates what protesters <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> about these protests, that these mass arrests are essentially a tactic by Montreal police to prevent by fear the involvement of young people who take to the streets in protest." ...|$|E
2500|$|May's public reticence {{during the}} {{referendum}} campaign resulted in tensions with David Cameron and his pro-EU team. Following the referendum and her election as party leader, May signalled {{that she would}} support full withdrawal from the EU and prioritise immigration controls over remaining within the single market, leading some to contrast this with her earlier remarks on the earlier economic arguments. She later {{went on to say}} before the 2017 UK general election that she would be willing to leave the EU without a deal, saying that [...] "no deal is better than a bad deal. We {{have to be prepared to}} walk out". The Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, said it was [...] "disappointing that Theresa May lacked the political courage to warn the public as she did a bunch of bankers in private about the devastating economic effects of Brexit. More disappointing is that now she is supposedly in charge, she is blithely ignoring her own warnings and is prepared to inflict an act of monumental self-harm on the UK economy by pulling Britain out of the single market." [...] Phil Wilson for the 'Open Britain' group said, [...] "It's good to know that privately Theresa May thinks what many of us <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> publicly for a long time, leaving the single market would be bad for businesses and for our economy. Now she is prime minister, Theresa May is in an unrivalled position to act on her previous concerns, starting by putting membership of the single market at the heart of her government's negotiating position." ...|$|E
2500|$|The International Association for the Advancement of Space Safety (IAASS) {{heavily criticized}} Virgin Galactic {{within hours of}} the accident. Tommaso Sgobba, Executive Director of the IAASS, claimed that Virgin Galactic had refused to let IAASS {{scientists}} review its procedures and snubbed industry gatherings. He stated: [...] "They operated in secrecy, which is difficult to understand. They don’t use modern techniques in putting safety into the design. They use outdated methods like testing and then seeing what happens. There has been no independent oversight. There is no peer review. I <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> for some years now this was an accident waiting to happen." [...] Sgobba, the former head of flight safety for the European Space Agency, said on November 6, 2014 that industry best practice called for operators to build in [...] "two-failure tolerance", or sufficient safeguards to survive two separate, unrelated failures—two human errors, two mechanical errors or one of each. [...] "What we see in the incident is what we call 'zero-failure tolerance'," [...] Mr Sgobba said. [...] "So you make the mistake—you have a catastrophe. The design would not be acceptable in other safety-critical industries, such as aircraft manufacture." [...] Other members of IAASS also commented on the accident in the immediate aftermath. Rocket propulsion expert and rocket powered dragster driver Carolynne Campbell-Knight was quoted as saying that Virgin Galactic [...] "...should stop, give up. Go away and do something they might be good at like selling mobile phones. They should stay out of the space business." [...] Campbell-Knight also stated that an explosion of the nitrous oxide hybrid propulsion system was the cause of the accident, although the initial NTSB report did not indicate that the propulsion system contributed to the breakup of the vehicle.|$|E
