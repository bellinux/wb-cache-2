A second purpose of the research was to compare the relative effects of past and future <b>external</b> <b>reference</b> prices. Future <b>external</b> <b>reference</b> prices {{were found to have}} positive effects on consumer deal evaluations. Additionally, these effects were more pronounced than those of past <b>external</b> <b>reference</b> prices...|$|R
40|$|This paper models {{different}} <b>external</b> <b>reference</b> pricing schemes - a {{price cap}} {{based on the}} drug price {{in one or two}} countries and on the minimum or average drug price - in a three-country framework. It studies the choice of <b>external</b> <b>reference</b> pricing schemes in one country as well as its effect on welfare in the other countries, the manufacturer 4 s export decision, and the incentives for the other countries to also adopt an <b>external</b> <b>reference</b> pricing scheme. Depending on market size in the country adopting <b>external</b> <b>reference</b> pricing and market size difference of the other two countries, welfare is highest under the minimum price-rule or under the average price-rule. <b>External</b> <b>reference</b> pricing increases the drug price and decreases welfare in the other countries. If the market size in the country adopting an <b>external</b> <b>reference</b> pricing scheme is sufficiently large, the manufacturer does not export to the other countries.

40|$|Reference prices, {{which are}} {{extensively}} used in retail advertisements, have received considerable research attention {{over the last}} 25 years. The present research looks at {{the extent to which}} an advertised, or <b>external,</b> <b>reference</b> price included in a price promotion affects consumers' price beliefs. According to Helson's Adaptation-Level theory, consumers form an internal reference price, which they use as a basis for evaluating market prices. The process by which internal reference price can change according to an <b>external</b> <b>reference</b> price is, then, explained by a conjoint Adaptation-Level and Assimilation-Contrast theories. It is suggested that consumers may assimilate or contrast an <b>external</b> <b>reference</b> price and that only an assimilated price has the ability to affect the internal reference price. A first experiment was conducted to examine the extent to which consumers assimilate an <b>external</b> <b>reference</b> price. Findings from the present research suggested that, contrary to the predictions of the Assimilation-Contrast theory, the impact of an <b>external</b> <b>reference</b> price on consumers' internal price standards was monotonic. It was further suggested that this assimilation might be moderated by individual differences. A second experiment was conducted to examine the differential effects of two types of semantic cues. However, in the research, no differences were found between absolute and relative savings presentation formats. Findings as well as several issues about the measurement of internal reference price, the effects of an exaggerated <b>external</b> <b>reference</b> price and the effects of price familiarity are discussed...|$|R

40|$|<b>External</b> <b>referencing</b> of {{assessment}} and students’ achievement standards {{is a growing}} priority area within higher education, which is being pressured by government requirements to evidence outcome attainment. <b>External</b> <b>referencing</b> benefits stakeholders connected to higher education by helping to assure that assessments and standards within courses are appropriate and comparable among institutions. <b>External</b> <b>referencing</b> takes many forms, which have different resourcing requirements, outcomes, and operational strengths and challenges. This paper describes the <b>External</b> <b>Referencing</b> of Standards (ERoS) approach developed, tested and adopted by a university consortium. ERoS draws on the strengths of existing methodologies to produce an evolved model that is effective, efficient, transparent and open, capability building and sustainable.

The process facilitates capability building, such that participants garnered insights valuable to enact quality assurance and enhancement of existing courses, and fosters connections that facilitate collaboration and peer-learning.
