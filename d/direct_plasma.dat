40|$|Plasma in {{the sense}} of ionized gas can be {{referred}} to as the fourth state of matter following solids, liquids, and gases in view of their energy content. Application of high voltages across small gas filled spaces results in ionization of the air. Generally, two types of cold plasma can be discerned: <b>direct</b> <b>plasma</b> (e. g. dielectric barrier discharge-DBD) and indirect plasma (plasma torch, plasma jet). In indirect plasma treatment, the plasma is produced in a remote cavity and ejected by gas flow onto the skin {{in the form of an}} effluent. In <b>direct</b> <b>plasma</b> treatment, the skin itself acts as the counter electrode. Advantageous features of <b>direct</b> <b>plasma</b> treatment include the higher plasma density as well as the induced high frequency electric current onto the skin. In plasma treatment antiinflammatory, antipruritic, antimicrobial, tissue stimulation, stimulation of microcirculation, and other therapeutic effects are achieved in a single treatment due to the combined action of ultraviolet radiation, reactive oxygen species (e. g. ozone), reactive nitrogen species, and electric fields. In line with other reports, we have already demonstrated the use of <b>direct</b> <b>plasma</b> treatment in skin disinfection, in atopic eczema (superinfected dermatitis), in modulating the epidermal barrier, as well as in chronic wound treatment. We as well as others did not notice any side effects of plasma treatment so far. In summary, cold atmospheric pressure plasma constitutes a new and innovative treatment option especially for superinfected skin diseases. These promising relatively new clinical applications warrant further carefully conducted translational research to delineate the modes of actions of plasma as well as potential long term side effects. This should lead to norms for the technical devices to allow a standardized treatment of given diseases in the mid-term...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Quasistationary {{discharge}} mode {{setting in}} the explosive-emission sources {{is related to the}} saturation of the cathode plasma emissive ability resulting in the decrease of the velocity of plasma propagation into the interelectrode gap. It was shown previously that the electron beam space charge providing the current rise slowing-down is of great importance in the process of the discharge mode stabilization. The paper considers a possibil-ity of the discharge protraction at the expense of decrease of the ion charge order in the plasma composition and application of the <b>directed</b> <b>plasma</b> flows.

With the direct CCP-PEALD the film composition was closer to stoichiometric, and film crystallinity was enhanced.

To further understand mechanisms by which T cell inputs regulate B cell fate decision, we investigate the minimal IL- 2 stimulation for triggering human plasma {{cell differentiation}} in vitro.
