500|$|Mark Giordano {{was born}} in Toronto, Ontario on October 3, 1983. His father, Paul, is {{a real estate agent}} and his mother, Anna, a hairdresser. [...] Giordano has an older sister, Michelle, and had another older sister, Mia, who was killed in a car {{accident}} when he was 14. [...] <b>He</b> <b>taps</b> his helmet twice with his stick at the end of the national anthems before each game as a quiet tribute to his sister, whose death had a lasting impact on Giordano and his family and brought them closer together.|$|E
2500|$|However, Norman {{decides to}} cast his [...] spell to give +3/+3 to his Grizzly Bears before combat damage is dealt. <b>He</b> <b>taps</b> a Forest {{to pay for}} the spell, and puts Giant Growth on the stack. Tom, who does not want to give the Grizzly Bears a chance to grow to 5/5 and kill his Hill Giant, {{responds}} by casting [...] targeting the Grizzly Bears. <b>He</b> <b>taps</b> one Mountain {{to pay for the}} spell, and puts Shock on the stack on top of Giant Growth. If Norman had no other spells, then Tom's Shock would resolve first and deal 2 damage to the Grizzly Bears, killing them. His Giant Growth would then go to the graveyard with no effect because the Bears would no longer be on the battlefield and would thus be an illegal target. Fortunately for Norman, he has another spell to cast. <b>He</b> <b>taps</b> a Plains and casts [...] targeting his Grizzly Bears. Now Mending Hands is on top of the stack, with Shock and then Giant Growth beneath it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll take a chance, {{and knock}} on the door anyhow," [...] he told himself, and moving to the door of Jessie's room, <b>he</b> <b>tapped</b> lightly. Then, as there was no response, <b>he</b> <b>tapped</b> again.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>tapped</b> {{them with}} his forefinger, and the Prince nodded thoughtfully.|$|R

60|$|PAUL. Alas, Simone, too true. (<b>He</b> <b>taps</b> {{his coat}} pocket.) There it lies. To-morrow I have {{a hundred and}} seventy {{thousand}} francs to pay, or be dishonoured. I cannot pay the sum. A Barbazange does not survive dishonour. My ancestors were Crusaders, preux chevaliers to a man. Their code is mine. Dishonour for me is worse than death.|$|E

60|$|STEPHEN: (Laughs emptily) My {{centre of}} gravity is displaced. I have {{forgotten}} the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but but human philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (<b>He</b> <b>taps</b> his brow) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.|$|E
60|$|What I chiefly dislike {{about the}} man through the wall is his {{treatment}} of his clay. A clay, I need scarcely say, has an entirely different tap from a meerschaum, but the man through the wall does not treat these two pipes {{as if they were}} on an equality. He ought to tap his clay on the palm of his hand, but he seldom does so, and I am strongly of opinion that when he does, it is only because he has forgotten {{that this is not the}} meerschaum. Were he to tap the clay on the walls or on the ribs of the fireplace he would smash it, so <b>he</b> <b>taps</b> it on a coal. About this there is something contemptible. I am not complaining because he has little affection for his clay. In face of all that has been said in honor of clays, and knowing that this statement will occasion an outcry against me, I admit that I never cared for clays myself. A rank tobacco is less rank through a church-warden, but to smoke the Arcadia through a clay is to incur my contempt, and even my resentment. But to disbelieve in clays is one thing and to treat them badly is another. If the man through the wall has decided, after reflection and experiment, that his clay is a mistake, I say let him smoke it no more; but so long as he does smoke it I would have it receive consideration from him. I very much question whether, if he reads his heart, he could learn from it that he loves his meerschaum more than his clay, yet because the meerschaum cost more <b>he</b> <b>taps</b> it on his palm. This is a serious charge to bring against any man, but I do not make it lightly.|$|E
6000|$|But if {{you know}} your way about, you follow him in. There are seats within, {{and you have a}} {{newspaper}} in your pocket: the time will pass more pleasantly. Inside he looks round, bewildered. The German post-office, generally speaking, {{is about the size of}} the Bank of England. Some twenty different windows confront your troubled friend, each one bearing its own particular legend. Starting with number one, he sets to work to spell them out. It appears to him that the posting of letters is not a thing that the German post-office desires to encourage. Would he not like a dog licence instead? is what one window suggests to him. [...] "Oh, never mind that letter of yours; come and talk about bicycles," [...] pleads another. At last he thinks he has found the right hole: the word [...] "Registration" [...] he distinctly recognizes. <b>He</b> <b>taps</b> at the glass.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>tapped</b> {{his head}} triumphantly, and, with a bleared, shining old eye, winked at the cook.|$|R
60|$|A {{third man}} {{had come into}} the room. <b>He</b> <b>tapped</b> Selingman on the {{shoulder}} and whispered in his ear.|$|R

[As SYBIL {{subsides}} {{into what}} the Wylies with one glance {{would call the}} best chair, MAGGIE's men-folk are brought in by JOHN, all carrying silk hats and looking very active after their long rest in the train. They are gazing about them. They would like this lady, they would like JOHN, they would even like MAGGIE to go away for a little and leave them to examine the room. Is that linen on the walls, for instance, or just paper? Is the carpet as thick as it feels, or is there brown paper beneath it? Had MAGGIE got anything off that bookcase {{on account of the}} worm-hole? DAVID even discovers that we were simpletons when we said {{there was nothing in the}} room that pretended to be what it was not. <b>He</b> <b>taps</b> the marble mantelpiece, and is favourably impressed by the tinny sound.] ...|$|E

6000|$|Hubert St. Leonard, of Windrush Bottom Farm, I {{found to}} be a worried- looking gentleman. <b>He</b> <b>taps</b> his weather-glass, and hopes and fears, not knowing as yet that all things have been ordered for his ill. It will be years before his spirit is attuned to that {{attitude}} of tranquil despair essential to the farmer: one feels it. He is tall and thin, with a sensitive, mobile face, and a curious trick of taking his head every now and again between his hands, as if to be sure it is still there. When I met him he was on the point of starting for his round, so I walked with him. He {{told me that he had}} not always been a farmer. Till a few years ago he had been a stockbroker. But he had always hated his office; and having saved a little, had determined when he came to forty to enjoy the rare luxury of living his own life. I asked him if he found that farming paid. He said: ...|$|E
60|$|Old M. des Cadoux {{laughed in}} the dark, as with his sword {{hanging from his}} wrist <b>he</b> <b>tapped</b> his snuff-box.|$|R

60|$|I {{give the}} story as it was told me, and it was told me for a fact. A man fell from a housetop {{in the city of}} Aberdeen, and was brought into {{hospital}} with broken bones. He was asked what was his trade, and replied that he was a tapper. No one had ever heard of such a thing before; the officials were filled with curiosity; they besought an explanation. It appeared that when a party of slaters were engaged upon a roof, they would now and then be taken with a fancy for the public-house. Now a seamstress, for example, might slip away from her work and no one be the wiser; but if these fellows adjourned, the tapping of the mallets would cease, and thus the neighbourhood be advertised of their defection. Hence the career of the tapper. He has to do the tapping and keep up an industrious bustle on the housetop during the absence of the slaters. When <b>he</b> <b>taps</b> for only one or two the thing is child's-play, but when he has to represent a whole troop, it is then that he earns his money in the sweat of his brow. Then must he bound from spot to spot, reduplicate, triplicate, sexduplicate his single personality, and swell and hasten his blows, until he produce a perfect illusion for the ear, and you would swear that a crowd of emulous masons were continuing merrily to roof the house. It must be a strange sight from an upper window.|$|E
60|$|In {{his high}} place sits the President, Abrahamowicz, {{object of the}} Opposition's {{limitless}} hatred. He is sunk back {{in the depths of}} his arm-chair, and has his chin down. He brings the ends of his spread fingers together, in front of his breast, and reflectively taps them together, with the air of one who would like to begin business, but must wait, and be as patient as he can. It makes you think of Richelieu. Now and then he swings his head up to the left or to the right and answers something which some one has bent down to say to him. Then <b>he</b> <b>taps</b> his fingers again. He looks tired, and maybe a trifle harassed. He is a gray-haired, long, slender man, with a colourless long face, which, in repose, suggests a death-mask; but when not in repose is tossed and rippled by a turbulent smile which washes this way and that, and is not easy to keep up with--a pious smile, a holy smile, a saintly smile, a deprecating smile, a beseeching and supplicating smile; and when it is at work the large mouth opens, and the flexible lips crumple, and unfold, and crumple again, and move around in a genial and persuasive and angelic way, and expose large glimpses of the teeth; and that interrupts the sacredness of the smile and gives it momentarily a mixed worldly and political and satanic cast. It is a most interesting face to watch. And then the long hands and the body--they furnish great and frequent help to the face in the business of adding to the force of the statesman's words.|$|E
