40|$|Simulation at the machine-control level {{plays an}} {{important}} role in designing machine controls and operational specifications. Recently, there has been a considerable amount of work done in the area of manufacturing systems control. This micro-level type of modeling is as important as modeling at the plant level. This paper is an application case study of modeling at the machine-control level. The objective of this paper is to address the issues of augmenting control design for automated production systems through the use of DES. The case study is an automated process of a frame turnover. In this process, an inbound conveyor transfers large frames into a turnover unit. Frames are accelerated toward the lift and rotate unit using a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>slide.</b> Frames are lifted and rolled over side to side then lowered onto an outbound pedestal conveyor. The pedestal conveyor shifts frames to the unloading station. The objectives of the case study were to visualize the turnover process and to design the sequences and timing of its operations. Based on that, it is required to verify that there is enough time for the turnover process to take place in synch with the movement of the inbound and pedestal conveyors. Finally, the machine controls are designed so that the system throughput and operational specifications are achieved...|$|E
50|$|The current Hauser Dam {{has four}} sections: An {{overflow}} spillway, abutments {{on either side}} of the overflow spillway, a non-spillover section east of the left abutment (below which is the powerhouse), and a 32 ft deep forebay which impounds water behind the powerhouse. The spillway is 493 ft long. Five <b>hydraulic</b> <b>sliding</b> gates and 17 manually operated flashboards allow water to overflow the dam. Hauser Dam can only generate 17 megawatts of power, and so requires little water to function.|$|R
50|$|The five cables {{arrived in}} the Port of Vancouver, Washington, USA on June 9 and were shipped to Whistler via train, {{arriving}} on June 16. Vancouver, Washington was used because it owns the largest mobile harbour crane on the West Coast of North America. To handle the 90-tonne reels, a German-made Goldhofer heavy-haulage trailer and tractor made its way from Montreal, QC to Whistler {{to take care of}} the transport from the train yard up the mountain. The Goldhofer trailer has four sections with six axles, each. Each axle has eight wheels. The trailer also features a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>sliding</b> system, which enabled the reels to be unloaded from the railcars in Whistler without a crane. Since there is no crane to lift each reel onto the truck, this trailer features sliding steel plates that essentially scoop the load from the train and set it onto the trailer deck. The five cables were trucked up Blackcomb Mountain for pulling across the valley starting June 19. Their entire 18000 mi journey from Switzerland to the top of Blackcomb Mountain was coordinated by OmniTrans Corporation.|$|R
40|$|In the Italian environments, the {{rapeseed}} (Brassica napus L.) is subjected, at ripening, to a {{seed shattering}} causing significant losses that reduce the yield {{and increase the}} oilseed rape seedbank in the soil. Meteorological events and mechanical harvesting are the main factors affecting the extent of seed dispersal. Lacking the availability of works investigating the actual losses during the harvest at large scale, the Consiglio per la sperimentazione e la ricerca in agricoltura, Unità di ricerca per l’ingegneria agraria (CRA-ING) has conducted a study {{in order to determine}} the effective seed losses at on-farm scale. The amount of losses of two combine headers, traditional for wheat and specific for oilseed rape harvest, was compared. The rapeseed header had a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>sliding</b> cut-bar and two vertical electric blade on both sides in order to reduce the pulling and tearing action between the cut-off plants and those still standing. The seed losses were evaluated before and during the harvesting by using plastic trays placed on the ground within the crop rows. The trays were arranged in a layout allowing the estimation of the seed losses of three different sectors of the combine headers. The results have demonstrated that, at farm level, the use of a specific oilseed rape header adapted and optimized for the crop requirements allows to obtain a level of seed losses (0, 97 % of total production), below the values reported in literature. For rapeseed, the higher losses are localized at the final parts of the head, where the plants are strictly intertwined...|$|R

This drive should give free control for valve lift, valve opening and valve closing time.

One of the basic components of high pressure HEUI injector for the Diesel engine – electric valve with solenoid was chosen as electric control valve. Principle of operation, physical and mathematical model of this drive is to be presented in this paper.

A compensating tube {{ran down the}} center of the two spaces, to make up for the lost weight as mines were laid, as well as to store eight additional mines. The other mines were racked in three groups around this tube, two in the fore compartment, one aft, with a hydraulically driven rotating cage between them. Mines were moved by hydraulic worm shafts, the aft racks connecting directly to the launch tubes, which had vertically <b>sliding</b> <b>hydraulic</b> doors (rather than the usual hinged ones of torpedo tubes). Each launch tube was normally loaded with four mines, and a water 'round mines (WRM) tube flooded to compensate as they were laid, then pumped into the compensating tube.

40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) studies {{have become a}} significant part of the design and development process. An important type of engineering problem which is becoming widely studied is the simulation of systems involving rotating machinery. This work explores two of the popular methods for simulating rotation within a CFD framework: Multiple Reference Frames (MRF) and Sliding Mesh models. Currently, MRF is more popular due to the significantly smaller computational demands, but it is limited to systems where the relative position of rotating components to stationary components is not important with respect to the parameters of interest. The main focus of the study is the development of a Ventricular Assist Device (VAD) for supporting patients born with Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome, a congenital heart defect which presents as a malformation of the left ventricle. This VAD is an axial blood pump known as a viscous impeller pump (VIP) and simulation results are validated against separately obtained data from Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) as well as experimental <b>hydraulic</b> performance. The <b>Sliding</b> Mesh formulation was found to more accurately predict the pressure rise created by the VIP. The Sliding Mesh and MRF approaches perform similarly when comparing the velocity field with PIV data. The MRF method is recommended based on the much higher computational cost associated with obtaining time-averaged velocity profiles using the Sliding Mesh method. Additionally, four different turbulence models are employed: the standard k – epsilon, Realizable k – epsilon, standard k – omega, and k – omega Shear Stress Transport (SST). The choice of turbulence model had a significant effect on the resulting flow field and blood damage prediction. The Realizable k – epsilon model gave the best agreement with PIV profiles, most accurately predicted the pressure rise across the pump, and was able to capture mean flow features indicated by experiment. ...|$|R
40|$|Menorca is {{subdivided}} in main {{regions with}} different stratigraphic and tectonic characteristics. To the north, folded, thrusted and faulted Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Paleogene rocks compose the Tramuntana region. To the south, upper-Miocene carbonate and, locally, siliciclastic rocks compose the Migjorn region. Upper Miocene rocks unconformably overlie Paleozoic to middle Miocene basement. In the Migjorn, three Miocene depositional units were recognized (Pomar et al., 2002 and references herein) : the Basal Conglomeratic Unit (Burdigalian p. p.), interpreted as near-shore to fan-delta deposits; the Lower Bar Unit (early Tortonian), {{interpreted as a}} distally steepened carbonate ramp; the Reef Complex (upper Tortonian - lower Messinian), a reef-rimmed platform prograding complex. Within the ramp, Pomar et al. (2002) distinguished four facies belts: fan-delta conglomerates and bioturbated packstones (inner ramp), crossbedded grainstones (middle- ramp), rhodolithic rudstone clinobeds (ramp slope) and fine-grained wackestone-packstone with planktonic foraminifers (outer ramp). The cross-bedded units here analysed occur at the transition lower slope-outer ramp. They infill the axial depression of large slide/slump scars. These scars truncate the gently, 10 °- 12 ° basinward dipping, slope-to-outer ramp succession. The wedge-shaped cross-bedded units, 10 - 12 m thick, pinch out basinward and extend laterally for tens of meters. Several amalgamated cross-laminated bodies, 40 cm- to 2 m wide each with erosive base compose each unit. They are composed by rhodolithic-mollusk rudstone with coarse grain/packstone matrix. Porosity is very high, cementation low and dolomitization patchy. Matrix consists of red-algal-, bivalve-, echinoderm, coral fragments, and benthic foraminifers. Ooids are, locally abundant along with limestone pebbles. Pebbles are flat, 5 - to 10 -cm wide, of oolitic grainstone, sometimes with mollusk borings. Cross bedding is underlined by the abundance and orientation of coarser components. Cross-laminae within units dip upslope (8 ° to 35 °) forming backstepping backsets. Upslope bedform migration has been explained as forming when a supercritical flow encounters a local obstruction (or a local break on the slope), and a hydraulic jump may occur within the flow, upcurrent from the obstruction. Sediment will be therefore deposited at the obstruction forming an up-flow-dipping slipface that will tend to accrete and migrate in the upflow direction. In Menorca, these sedimentary structures have been interpreted by Pomar et al. (2002), as backset beds related to up-stream migrating <b>hydraulic</b> jump where <b>slide</b> scars acted as slope channels funneling platform debris down the slope. The occurrence of aragonitic components (oolites, corals) within these units, absent in the ramp system, and the scars development {{at the end of}} the ramp progradation, suggest the involvement of Reef Complex sediment. Therefore, those events, involved both sediment of the upper Tortonian distally steepened ramp and part of the Reef Complex. These structures have been mostly described in different environments of terrigenous systems. In carbonate systems are scarcely described and none from carbonate ramps. The architecture characterizing these upslope cross-bedded beds seams to call for a scour-and-fill process, therefore initially the action of a strong scouring event immediately followed by depositional events. The presence of these bodies in various intervals suggests the repetitive occurrence of this process. In the studied system, deep-scouring events on the platform could be represented by slope failures that induced tsunami events or by eustatic variations, able to create strong downslope flows directed offshore. Scours have been rapidly infilled by shallow-water sediment...|$|R
40|$|The ground ropes {{function}} {{is to keep the}} net in contact with the sea bottom, and herd fishes to the entrance of the bag net. In the case of thinking about selective fishing with a drag net, it is necessary to clarify the shape and herding function of the ground rope. But there are very few reports about it. In this paper, the author considered forces acting on the ground rope under towing conditions, and decided the shape of it analytically. The author designed a fish herding model the ground rope based on the theoretical probability of fiches entering the funnel of a net. Based on these results, the author investigated the shape and gear efficiency of the ground rope. Finally the author intended to obtain rational instructions for designing of ground rope. (1) The construction and weight distribution of three types of ground rope: Danish Seine, Bull Trawl and Trawl, (typical drag nets operated in Japan), were compared. Weight distribution of both Danich Seine and Trawl are uniform. But the mean weight of the later is much heavier than that of the former. It the case of comparison of Trawl and Bull Trawl, the former is long and increases its weight towards the middle. The latter is short and very heavy and shows little difference in its weight distribution. The difference in fishing methods are clearly influenced {{in the construction of the}} two types ground rope. (2) Three forces: hydraulic resistance of netting concentrated at the lacign line, hydraulic resistance of ground rope, and sliding frictional force between sea bottom are acting on the ground rope under towing conditions. At equilibrium those forces made a fixed ground rope shape. The author assumed the ground rope as a connection of segments, and considered an equlibrium among three components acting on them: horizontal, vertical and tangential components. In general it is impossible to express the vertical and horizontal component acting on each segment of the ground rope as a simple function. Assuming that the horizontal component acting on each segment of the ground rope is constant at any part, the length and end distances are known ahead of time, the shape of the ground rope was expressed graphically based on the distribution of vertical components of it which were obtained experimentaly. (3) The vertical component acting on each segment of the ground rope under towing conditions was expressed as the sum of <b>hydraulic</b> resistance, <b>sliding</b> frictional force and sand drag. Drag of clyinder type of bobbins at different lengths and that of sphere type of bobbins in various directions were measured both on wet concrete and in a sand tank with water. The drag of two types bobbin on a rocky bottom (F_D) had no directional qualities, and may be expressed as the product of weight of bobbin (W_B) and drag coefficient (μ_ 90); F_D=μ_ 90 W_B. The drag coefficient of cylinder type of bobbins and sphere type of bobbins were 0. 75 and 0. 68 respectively. The drag of cylinder type of bobbins in towed on a sandy bottom is dependent upon the on attack angle (90 °-θ), and may be expressed the product of the weight of bobbin (W_B) and drag coefficient (μθ) as follows; F_D=μθW_B. The drag coefficient is a function of θ　and is expressed as follows; μθ= 0. 68 (0. 72 sin^[1. 5]θ+cos^[1. 5]θ). In the case of a sphere, the drag coefficient was denoted a constant value of 0. 68. Hydraulic resistance of model ground rope composed of clyinder type of bobbins was measured in a circulating tank. Hydraulic drag coefficient (C_D) showed a constant value of about 0. 45. (4) Three types of model ground rope differing in weight distribution were made. These were examined both on wet concrete and sandy sea bottom under various conditions for the purpose of measuring shape and resistance. Close agreement was shown between experimental values of the shape and resistance of them, and those of calculated values obtained by analytically using the drag coeffieients mentioned above. When the distribution of forces acting on ground rope uder towing condition are known, the shape of it can be decided using the method proposed in this study. On the other hand the weight distribution of ground rope for making a certain ground rope shape can be decided using the method proposed in this study. (5) The author paid attention to fish reaction to the ground rope and considered a fish herding model for the ground rope. Theoretical probability of fishes entering the funnel of the bag net was calculated, and six theoretical types of ground rope: triangle, trapezoid, half ellipse, arc, parabola and catenary were compared. The fishing efficiency of trapezoid, parabola, half ellipse and catenary showed almost same values under towing condition based on the fish herding model for flat fish. The wing tips distance at maximum fishing efficiency was wider than usual towing conditions. Higher fishing efficiency would be expected under that towing condition. Fishing efficiency of two types of ground rope, middle-weighted Bull Trawl type and heavy-weighted Trawl type, were compared by towing on a sandy sea bottom using the fish herding model proposed in this study. Fishing efficiency of the former was a little higher than that of the latter. This corelates well with the results of field experiments. (6) The ratio of resistance of ground rope to the total resistance of drag net was about 30 - 35 % under towing condition. It is imposible to change a ground rope shape under towing condition by means of variation on the weight distribution of the ground rope. In the case of thinking on the ground rope shape, it is necessary to consider the hydraulic resistance of netting which were concentrated to the lacing lines and acting on the ground rope. The trapezoid shape glound rope was showed the fishing efficiency using the fish herding model proposed in this study. About 30 - 35 % of resistance of drag net should act on the points both edge of bosom of ground rope to make a trapezoid-shape ground rope. It is one method to concentrate whole drag acting on ground rope and hydraullic resistance of netting there as a results of many considerations on weight distribution of ground rope and the design of lacing lines...|$|R
