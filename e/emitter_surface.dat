For example, in the 1960s, FEM results contributed significantly to discussions on heterogeneous catalysis. FEM has also been used for studies of surface-atom diffusion. However, FEM has now been almost completely superseded by newer surface-science techniques.|$|E

Thus, the Ru(CO) 4 {{is the product of a}} surface reaction occurring field free in the time between the pulses. Variation of this reaction time at different temperatures proves the RU(CO) 2 formation to be associated with an activated process.

2500|$|Energy {{distribution}} {{measurements of}} field-emitted electrons were first reported in 1939. In 1959 it was realized theoretically by Young, and confirmed experimentally by Young and Mueller that the quantity measured in spherical geometry was {{the distribution of}} the total energy of the emitted electron (its [...] "total energy distribution"). This is because, in spherical geometry, the electrons move in such a fashion that angular momentum about a point in the emitter is very nearly conserved. Hence any kinetic energy that, at emission, is in a direction parallel to the <b>emitter</b> <b>surface</b> gets converted into energy associated with the radial direction of motion. So what gets measured in an energy analyzer is the total energy at emission.|$|E
40|$|Typical {{designs for}} a Heavy Ion Fusion Power Plant require the source {{injector}} to deliver 100 beams, packed into an array with a spacing of 7 cm. When designing source injectors using a single large aperture source for each beam, the <b>emitter</b> <b>surfaces</b> are packed into an array with a spacing of 30 cm. Thus, the matching {{section of the}} source injector must not only prepare the beam for transport in a FODO lattice, but also funnel the beams together. This {{can be accomplished by}} an ESQ matching section in which each beam travels on average at a slight angle to the axis of the quadrupoles and uses the focusing effect of the FODO lattice to maintain the angle. At the end of the matching section, doublet steering is used to bring the beams parallel to each other for injection into the main accelerator. A specific solution of this type for an 84 -beam source injector is presented. PACS: 41. 75. Ak, 41. 85. Ar, 41. 85. J...|$|R
40|$|This work {{considers}} {{the effects of}} the Hurst exponent (H) on the local electric field distribution and the slope of the Fowler-Nordheim (FN) plot when considering the cold field electron emission properties of rough Large-Area Conducting Field <b>Emitter</b> <b>Surfaces</b> (LACFESs). A LACFES is represented by a self-affine Weierstrass-Mandelbrot function in a given spatial direction. For 0. 1 ≤ H 1, has been found. This feature, which is less pronounced (but not absent) in the range where more smooth surfaces have been found (0. 5 ≤ H ≤ 0. 9), is a consequence of the dependency between the area efficiency of emission of a LACFES and the macroscopic electric field, which is often neglected in the interpretation of cold field electron emission experiments. Considering the recent developments in orthodox field emission theory, we show that the exponent β_H must be considered when calculating the slope characterization parameter (SCP) and thus provides a relevant method of more precisely extracting the characteristic field enhancement factor from the slope of the FN plot.

40|$|The {{adsorption}} and the {{catalytic decomposition}} of NO on Pt and Pu field <b>emitter</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{has been studied}} by pulsed field desorption mass spectrometry (PFCMS). A molecular adsorption of NO was found on stepped Pt (111) and (001) surfaces {{in the absence of}} electrostatic fields. From the temperature dependence of the mean lifetimes before thermal desorption an activation energy Ed= 153 kJ/mol and a pre-exponential term τ 0 = 5 x 10 - 15 sec have been evaluated. These values are considered as representative for desorption from steps. The formation of surface oxides at temperatures T= 535 [...] . 602 K was observed for stepped Pt(001), but not for stepped (111) surfaces. The time dependence of the PtO+ intensity is due to a consecutive reaction mechanism. On stepped Ru(001) surfaces a molecular as well as a dissociative adsorption of NO occurs even at 300 K. At 500 K, Ru is more strongly oxidized than Pt, RuOn+x ions up to RuO 2 + 3 are observed. This implies an instability of Pu as a catalyst for NO decomposition...|$|R

40|$|Multispectral {{metamaterial}} absorbers {{based on}} metal-insulatormetal nano-square patch resonators are studied here. For a geometry consisting of perfectly nano-square patches and vertical sidewalls, double resonances in the visible regime are observed due to simultaneous excitation of electric and magnetic plasmon modes. Although slightly modifying {{the sizes of}} the square patches makes the resonance wavelengths simply shift, rounding corners of the square patches results in emergence of a third resonance due to excitation of the circular cavity modes. Sidewall angle of the patches are also observed to affect the absorption spectra significantly. Peak absorption values for the triple resonance structures are strongly affected as the sidewall angle varies from 90 to 50 degrees. Rounded corners and slanted sidewalls are typical imperfections for lithographically fabricated metamaterial structures. The presented results suggest that imperfections caused during fabrication of the top nanostructures {{must be taken into}} account when designing metamaterial absorbers.
