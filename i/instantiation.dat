25|$|The Zachman Framework is an {{enterprise}} ontology {{and is a}} fundamental structure for Enterprise Architecture which provides a formal and structured way of viewing and defining {{an enterprise}}. The ontology is a two dimensional classification schema that reflects the intersection between two historical classifications. The first are primitive interrogatives: What, How, When, Who, Where, and Why. The second {{is derived from the}} philosophical concept of reification, the transformation of an abstract idea into an <b>instantiation.</b> The Zachman Framework reification transformations are: Identification, Definition, Representation, Specification, Configuration and <b>Instantiation.</b>|$|E
25|$|One {{can also}} use PowerShell {{embedded}} in a management application, which uses the PowerShell runtime to implement the management functionality. For this, PowerShell provides a managed hosting API. Via the APIs, the application can instantiate a runspace (one <b>instantiation</b> of the PowerShell runtime), which runs in the application's process and is exposed as a Runspace object. The state of the runspace is encased in a SessionState object. When the runspace is created, the Windows PowerShell runtime initializes the <b>instantiation,</b> including initializing the providers and enumerating the cmdlets, and updates the SessionState object accordingly. The Runspace then must be opened for either synchronous processing or asynchronous processing. After {{that it can be}} used to execute commands.|$|E

25|$|This {{ideas about}} change and permanence, or {{becoming}} and Being, was {{the influence that}} led Plato to formulate his theory of forms.

25|$|In summary, a {{template}} is a compile-time parameterized function or class written without {{knowledge of the}} specific arguments used to instantiate it. After <b>instantiation,</b> the resulting code is equivalent to code written specifically for the passed arguments. In this manner, templates provide a way to decouple generic, broadly applicable aspects of functions and classes (encoded in templates) from specific aspects (encoded in template parameters) without sacrificing performance due to abstraction.|$|E

40|$|We {{can perform}} {{inference}} in Bayesian belief networks by enumerating <b>instantiations</b> with high probability thus approximating the marginals. In this paper, {{we present a}} method for determining the fraction of <b>instantiations</b> {{that has to be}} considered such that the absolute error in the marginals does not exceed a predefined value. The method is based on extreme value theory. Essentially, the proposed method uses the reversed generalized Pareto distribution to model probabilities of <b>instantiations</b> below a given threshold. Based on this distribution, an estimate of the maximal absolute error if <b>instantiations</b> with probability smaller than u are disregarded can be made.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the nature of internal representations constructed from learning concrete or generic <b>instantiations</b> of an abstract concept. Undergraduate students learned <b>instantiations</b> of a mathematical group that were generic, communicated concreteness relevant to the concept, or communicated concreteness irrelevant to the concept. Students who learned relevantly concrete <b>instantiations</b> were unable to recognize relational structure {{in the context of}} novel elements, while students who learned with no relevant concreteness were able to recognize the structure. This differential ability suggests participants constructed different representations which may in turn be responsible for differential transfer, with generic <b>instantiations</b> promoting transfer and relevantly concrete hindering. When given the alignment of elements across domains, all subjects transferred equally well, suggesting that alignment of elements helps disembed relational structure...|$|R

In other words, all non-omnipotent agents are concretely synthetic: constructed as contingencies of other, smaller, agents, meaning that they, unlike an omnipotent agent, logically can exist not only in multiple <b>instantiation</b> (by being constructed out of the more basic agents they are made of), but are each bound to a different location in space contra transcendent omnipresence.|$|E

Although major {{incidents}} are rare, the road is known for having several tight turns including a near 90-degree turn that gradually climbs up about 1.5 miles (2.5km) outside Fintona and at a bridge 4 miles (6km) from Fintona near the hamlet of Tattyreagh which snakes as an S-bend. The former is known for vehicles going off the road into a neighbouring field during very icy weather. The latter bridge had reinforcement work along with the <b>instantiation</b> of crash barriers installed in 2012 after concerns were raised locally about its safety after several accidents along {{with the fact that}} the river that flows under the bridge often breaks its banks after heavy rainfall.
