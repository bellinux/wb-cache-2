2500|$|Cornstalk's {{commanding}} presence often impressed American colonials. A Virginia officer, Col. Benjamin Wilson, {{wrote of}} Cornstalk's speech to Lord Dunmore at Camp Charlotte in 1774: [...] "I {{have heard the}} first orators in Virginia, Patrick Henry and Richard Henry Lee, but never have <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>one</b> whose powers of delivery surpassed those of Cornstalk on that occasion." ...|$|E
2500|$|Statements {{taken by}} Major Edward W. Wynkoop and his {{adjutant}} substantiated the later accounts of survivors. These statements were filed with his reports {{and can be}} found in the Official Records of the War of the Rebellion, copies of which were submitted as evidence in the Joint Committee of the Conduct of the War and in separate hearings conducted by the military in Denver. Lieutenant James D. Cannon describes the mutilation of human genitalia by the soldiers, [...] "men, women, and children's privates cut out. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>one</b> man say that he had cut a woman's private parts out and had them for exhibition on a stick. I heard of one instance of a child, a few months old, being thrown into the feed-box of a wagon, and after being carried some distance, left on the ground to perish; I also heard of numerous instances in which men had cut out the private parts of females and stretched them over their saddle-bows, and some of them over their hats." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his autobiography, {{written with}} help from ghostwriter Mickey Herskowitz, Rather wrote {{that he was in}} Dallas to return film from an {{interview}} that morning in Uvalde at the ranch of former Vice President John Nance Garner who actually celebrated his 95th (Rather erroneously called it his 98th) birthday on November 22. Although hired in August to set up a southern bureau for CBS in New Orleans, Rather had only recently moved from Dallas to New Orleans in November [...] and would not have been in Dallas except for the need to get film to Dallas CBS affiliate KRLD-TV (now KDFW) to feed to New York. Although he had no assigned reporting role in Dallas, Rather says he happened to be [...] "on {{the other side of the}} railroad tracks, beyond the triple underpass, thirty yards from a grassy knoll that would later figure in so many conspiracy theories." [...] His job was to fetch a film drop from a camera truck at that location and take it to the station for editing. He did not witness or hear the shooting, he said. He heard nothing of what may have caused the commotion until he reached KRLD, running all the way through Dealey Plaza, [...] "The moment I cleared the railroad tracks I saw a scene I will never forget. Some people were lying on the grass, some screaming, some running, some pointing. Policemen swarmed everywhere and distinctly above the din, <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>one</b> shout, 'DON'T ANYBODY PANIC.' And of course, there was nothing but panic wherever you looked." ...|$|E
60|$|I hesitated, perplexed whether I should pursue her. What {{did it all}} mean? Then <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> some <b>one</b> upstairs.|$|R
60|$|ARJILLAX. What! The ancients {{have their}} troubles! It {{is the first}} time <b>I</b> ever <b>heard</b> <b>one</b> of them confess it.|$|R
50|$|For <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> {{the young}} <b>ones</b> cry.|$|R
60|$|I am of the faery people. I sent my {{messengers}} {{for milk}} and fire, And then <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>one</b> call {{to me and}} came.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Poor devil!' <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>one</b> of the Spanish {{soldiers}} say as I went. 'Apostate or no, I {{am sorry}} for him; this is bloody work.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You watch it, Bill,' <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>one</b> man remark, 'we'll {{have that}} ---- {{laughing}} hyena' (the Vickers-Maxim gun) 'let off at us in a minute.' ...|$|E
60|$|THE CAPTAIN. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> that <b>one</b> of your fellows bolted, and ran {{right into}} the jaws of the lion. I laughed. I still laugh.|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>I</b> fancied <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> some <b>one</b> {{singing the}} Evening Hymn very sweetly last night--or was it only a dream?" [...] asked the young patient.|$|R
6000|$|... 'An' just as {{he crawled}} away <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> some <b>one</b> hollerin' to the hounds in our woods,' said he. 'Didn't you hear? You must ha' been asleep sure-ly.' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>one</b> desperate, weary 'damn!' float up {{from the}} pit of that torment. Pallant sawed on--'out of certain events which {{occurred}} at the village of Huckley.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'What's the use?' <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>one</b> fellow say; 'he must be {{chock-full of}} bullets long ago. We {{will go up}} and find his carcass in the morning.' ...|$|E
6000|$|IV:3:35 [...] LEON. [...] Is it the Carnival? What mummery's this? [...] What have <b>I</b> <b>heard?</b> <b>One</b> thing {{alone is}} clear. [...] We must {{be rid of}} Oran.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon," [...] he said, raising his hat. [...] "I was rather {{in a hurry}} and I quite thought <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> some <b>one</b> say 'Come in.'" ...|$|R
60|$|Lindy set {{her lips}} with a mighty resolve to be silent. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> some <b>one</b> coming along the gallery, and then I saw Nick's tall figure looming up behind her.|$|R
60|$|The last police-officer {{with whom}} he had conferred was {{standing}} silently behind us. I was not aware of it until he struck in on my saying <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> some <b>one</b> crying.|$|R
6000|$|... â€œI {{had no time}} to look round, {{but half}} a minute later <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>one</b> of the cannon go off, {{followed}} by yells and screams from the water.|$|E
6000|$|... "She has, anyway. Devine's wife {{brought him}} a pile, and <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>one</b> sister had {{the same as the}} other. Now, you ought to feel obliged to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Indeed <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>one</b> bitter word [...] That scarce is fit {{for you to}} hear; [...] Her manners had {{not that}} repose [...] Which stamps the caste of Vere de Vere.|$|E
6000|$|... "Maybe I don't {{want to see}} it!" [...] exclaimed Kells. [...] "A thirty-pounder! <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> of <b>one</b> once, sixty pounds, but I {{never saw}} it. You can't believe till you see." ...|$|R
6000|$|While {{still out}} of sight the trap stopped, and <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> some <b>one</b> jump from it. Then came this conversation, as {{distinct}} {{as though it had}} been spoken into my ear: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> some <b>one</b> {{coming through}} the bushes," [...] replied Bob, as he began a {{vigorous}} attack on the food; [...] "but I guess it was nothing but the wind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>one</b> man {{saying that}} about {{everything}} worth having had been gobbled up {{several weeks ago}} and the storekeepers were awaiting new consignments from San Francisco, Portland, and Seattle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Rattlesnakes!" [...] I exclaimed. [...] "Heavens! I'd die if <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>one,</b> {{let alone}} seeing it. A big rattler jumped at me one day, and I've never {{recovered}} from the shock." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's {{too young}} to feel it much," [...] <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>one</b> say to the other. [...] "So far as he is concerned, {{it seems like a}} mercy that it {{happened}} no later." ...|$|E
60|$|All {{this was}} upon Alan's side; and I {{had begun to}} think my share of the fight was at an end, when <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> some <b>one</b> drop softly on the roof above me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Hetty, [...] "you {{can talk}} when you break out. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> you <b>one</b> {{night in the}} car--but we'll get supper, and then if you're very good I'll show you something." ...|$|R
60|$|JOANNA. I am sure <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> some <b>one.</b> If it was Mabel! (With a perspicacity {{that comes}} of {{knowledge}} of her sex.) Jack, if she saw us she will think you were kissing me.|$|R
6000|$|As I {{went upstairs}} after dinner, {{two of the}} young men were {{settling}} their hats before the hall mirror, and <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>one</b> say low to the other, [...] "Who's the new party?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Instantly {{there was}} a great quiet. Now, first one and then another as the truth sunk into them, men began to fall upon their knees, and <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>one</b> say in an awed voice: ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{the hotel}} {{that night the}} main topic of conversation, with the {{possible}} exceptions of politics and prohibition, was the demise of Major Caswell. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>one</b> man say {{to a group of}} listeners: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, and voices! Once I {{thought that}} you must be all quarrelling, and then I thought that <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> some <b>one</b> fall down. After {{that there was nothing}} but the opening and {{shutting}} of doors." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{think that}} is the first time <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> any <b>one</b> link the comet {{with the end of the}} world. He had got that jumbled up with {{international}} politics and prophecies from the Book of Daniel.|$|R
6000|$|... "Alle guten Geister"--muttered the adept, {{the rest}} of the conjuration being lost in a tremulous warble of his voice,--"I do desires you not to speak so, Mr. Edie; for, from all <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> dat <b>one</b> other night, I do much believes"-- ...|$|R
