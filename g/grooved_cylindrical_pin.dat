40|$|Pin fin arrays {{are most}} {{commonly}} used to promote convective cooling within the internal passages of gas turbine airfoils. Contributing to the heat transfer are the surfaces of the channel walls {{as well as the}} pin itself. Generally the pin fin cross section is circular; how-ever, certain applications benefit from using other shapes such as oblong pin fins. The current study focuses on characterizing the heat transfer distribution on the surface of oblong pin fins with a particular focus on pin spacing effects. Comparisons were made with circular <b>cylindrical</b> <b>pin</b> fins, where both oblong and circular <b>cylindrical</b> <b>pins</b> had a height-to-diameter ratio of unity, with both streamwise and spanwise spacing varying between two and three diameters. To determine the effect of relative pin placement, meas-urements were taken in the first of a single row and in the third row of a multirow array. Results showed that area-averaged heat transfer on the pin surface was between 30 and 35 % lower for oblong pins in comparison to cylindrical. While heat transfer on the circular <b>cylindrical</b> <b>pin</b> experienced one minimum prior to boundary layer separation, heat transfer on the oblong pin fins experienced two minimums, where one is located before the boundary layer transitions to a turbulent boundary layer and the other prior to separation at the trailing edge.
