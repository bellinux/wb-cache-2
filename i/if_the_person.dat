5|$|A {{cohort study}} {{suggested}} that treatment of FH with statins {{leads to a}} 48% reduction in death from coronary heart disease {{to a point where}} people are no more likely to die of coronary heart disease than the general population. However, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> already had coronary heart disease the reduction was 25%. The results emphasize the importance of early identification of FH and treatment with statins.|$|E

Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered. The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).|$|E
5|$|The viral load of an {{infected}} person {{is an important}} risk factor in both sexual and mother-to-child transmission. During the first 2.5months of an HIV infection a person's infectiousness is twelve times higher due to this high viral load. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> is in the late stages of infection, rates of transmission are approximately eightfold greater.|$|E

On ordainment, Raming, Macy and Cook found that the Decretum Gratiani states, [...] "item Hermafroditus. <b>If</b> therefore <b>the</b> <b>person</b> is drawn to the feminine more than <b>the</b> male, <b>the</b> <b>person</b> does not receive <b>the</b> order. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> reverse, <b>the</b> <b>person</b> is able to receive but {{ought not to be}} ordained on account of deformity and monstrosity." ...|$|R
5|$|Dietary {{supplements}} often contain vitamins, but {{may also}} include other ingredients, such as minerals, herbs, and botanicals. Scientific evidence supports the benefits of dietary supplements for persons with certain health conditions. In some cases, vitamin supplements may have unwanted effects, especially if taken before surgery, with other dietary supplements or medicines, or <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> taking them has certain health conditions. They may also contain levels of vitamins many times higher, and in different forms, than one may ingest through food.|$|E
5|$|If {{pneumothorax}} {{occurs in}} a smoker, this is considered an opportunity to emphasize the markedly increased risk of recurrence in those who continue to smoke, and the many benefits of smoking cessation. It may be advisable for someone to remain off work {{for up to a}} week after a spontaneous pneumothorax. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> normally performs heavy manual labor, several weeks may be required. Those who have undergone pleurodesis may need two to three weeks off work to recover.|$|E
5|$|If the {{election}} is a non-reserved election, and the person applied for a community certificate, the certificate issued to him or the Community Committee's written rejection of the application. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> submitted a community declaration that did not include an application for a community certificate, {{he or she must}} submit the Community Committee's written acceptance of the declaration and a statutory declaration that he or she does not consider himself or herself a member of the Chinese community, Malay community, or Indian or other minority communities.|$|E

5|$|Malaria is a mosquito-borne {{infectious}} disease affecting humans {{and other animals}} caused by parasitic protozoans (a group of single-celled microorganisms) belonging to the Plasmodium type. Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, tiredness, vomiting, and headaches. In severe cases it can cause yellow skin, seizures, coma, or death. Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten. If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later. In those who have recently survived an infection, reinfection usually causes milder symptoms. This partial resistance disappears over months to years <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> has no continuing exposure to malaria.|$|E
5|$|Tablighi Jamaat {{encourages}} {{everyone to}} fulfill the Islamic requirement of dawah even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> falls short of strong religious intellect. This {{was different from the}} other Islamic movements which were mainly ulama-led and extended their leadership roles to the religious scholars. Tablighi Jamaat also disagree with the prevailing idea that the highest standards of Islamic scholarship and ethical standards were prerequisites for proselytising, and promote dawah as a mechanism of self-reform.|$|E
5|$|The killings {{helped to}} spur {{the passage of}} a new Maryland state law {{pertaining}} to the treatment of the mentally ill, which went into effect on October 1, 2003. The law's creation and passage were spurred in part by testimony from Logan's parents, James Logan, Sr. and Karen Logan. The law allows a judge to order a mandatory psychiatric evaluation of a person, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> presented a threat to themselves or to others.|$|E

50|$|It is {{an offence}} in Tasmania to have sexual {{intercourse}} with a <b>person</b> under <b>the</b> age of 17. However, it is a defence <b>if</b> <b>the</b> younger <b>person</b> was aged 12 {{years or older}} and the older was not more than 3 years their senior or, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> younger <b>person</b> was of or above 15 years and the older was not more than 5 years their senior.|$|R
5|$|Treatment {{may include}} {{activated}} charcoal <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> presents {{soon after the}} overdose. Attempting to force the person to vomit is not recommended. If {{there is a potential}} for toxicity, the antidote acetylcysteine is recommended. The medication is generally given for at least 24 hours. Psychiatric care may be required following recovery. A liver transplant may be required if damage to the liver becomes severe. The need for transplant is often based on low blood pH, high blood lactate, poor blood clotting, or significant hepatic encephalopathy. With early treatment liver failure is rare. Death occurs in about 0.1% of cases.|$|E
5|$|Under section 505(c) of the Penal Code, it is {{an offence}} to make, publish or {{circulate}} any statement, rumour or report in written, electronic or other media with an intent to incite, or {{which is likely to}} incite, any class or community of persons to commit any offence against any other class or community of persons. The penalty is imprisonment for up to three years, a fine, or both. No offence is committed <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> who made, published or circulated the statement had reasonable grounds for believing it was true, and did not intend to incite one community against another.|$|E
5|$|Without Marguerite Louise {{to occupy}} his attentions, Cosimo turned to persecuting the Jewish {{population}} of Tuscany. Sexual Intercourse between Jews and Christians was proscribed, {{and by a}} law promulgated on 1 July 1677, Christians could not work in establishments owned by Jews. If they did regardless, a fine of 50 crowns was incurred; <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> in question had insufficient funds, he was liable to be tortured on the rack; {{and if he was}} deemed unfit for torture, a four-month prison sentence was substituted. The anti-Semitic roster was supplemented by further declarations on 16 June 1679 and 12 December 1680 banning Jews from visiting Christian prostitutes and co-habitation, respectively.|$|E

5|$|From {{a survey}} by Devijver of persons whose origin can be determined, it appears that during the 1st century, the large {{majority}} (65%) of auxiliary prefects were of Italian origin. The Italian proportion dropped steadily, to 38% in the 2nd century, and 21% in the 3rd century. From the time of emperor Claudius (r. 41-54) only Roman knights were eligible to hold command of an auxiliary regiment. This status could be obtained either by birth (i.e. <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> {{was the son of}} a hereditary Roman knight; or by attaining the property qualification (100,000 denarii, the equivalent of 400 years' gross salary for an auxiliary alaris); or by military promotion: the latter were the chief centurions of legions (centurio primus pilus) who would normally be elevated to equestrian rank by the emperor after completing their single-year term as primuspilus.|$|E
5|$|In addition, at {{some time}} between {{the date of the}} writ of {{election}} and 12:00 noon on nomination day, the potential candidate or someone on his or her behalf must hand to the returning officer a deposit amounting to three times of 8% of the total allowances payable to an MP in the preceding calendar year, rounded to the nearest $500. At the 2017 presidential election, the deposit was $43,500. The deposit is returned <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> is not nominated as a candidate, withdraws his or her candidature, or is eventually elected. If the candidate is unsuccessful at the election, the deposit is only repaid if he or she polled more than one-eighth {{of the total number of}} votes polled, not including rejected votes.|$|E
5|$|Olfactory {{communication}} {{is very important}} in this species. It has roles in alerting others of the identity, physical state and position of the individual. It is also important in reproduction. Like other slow lorises, the Sunda slow loris has glands on its elbows that exude oils. The gland is licked to spread scent and is thought to have evolved for communication, but it is toxic to humans. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> is allergic to the animal they can go into shock and could even die. It also has glands on its anus and can signal conspecifics by perineal rubbing which deposits urine. When it locates the scent of another slow loris it may rub its face on the substrate where the scent was found.|$|E
