This study was the first {{to examine the effects of}} IIs on executive action control under acute psychosocial stress. Forty-two male subjects aged 21 - 39 years were randomly assigned to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) versus a rest condition. In addition, the instruction to the executive task (a <b>go</b> <b>no-go</b> task) was manipulated (IIs versus standard instruction).

Inter-task correlations were weak, providing little evidence for a homogenous or uniform construct of inhibition. The sensitivity of the AX-CPT to cognitive aging is discussed in the context of existing theories of cognitive aging.

40|$|Automatic facial {{categorization}} along dimensions such as familiarity, gender, race, {{expression and}} age facilitates social exchange. Here {{we focus on}} familiarity and gender in order to gauge their independence. Previous experiments are equivocal as to whether these dimensions are processed independently or not (Bruce and Young, 1986; Goshen-Gottstein and Ganel, 2000). If familiarity and gender were independent then facilitation or inhibition of one should not affect future performance on the other. Famous and unfamiliar faces were presented {{in a series of}} <b>go</b> <b>no-go</b> tasks. External features were removed ensuring that both famousness and gender decisions were based on the internal features of a face. Faces were presented in paired blocks such that a gender block (e. g., <b>go</b> male, <b>no-go</b> female) was followed by a familiarity block (e. g., <b>go</b> famous, <b>no-go</b> unfamiliar) or vice versa. The first block of each pair consisted of five famous males, five famous females, five unfamiliar males, and five unfamiliar females (each presented twice) in a random order. The second block consisted of the previously seen faces from the first block (old) with an additional 20 new faces (five of each type) so that every block contained 20 <b>go</b> and 20 <b>no-go</b> stimuli. An experimental session consisted of 16 counterbalanced block pairs. Results indicate that only unfamiliar faces solicit automatic gender categorization. When observers made a no-go decision on unfamiliar faces based on familiarity they were subsequently slower to determine the gender of those faces compared to previously unseen faces. However, if they made a no-go decision on unfamiliar faces based on gender, subsequently they were faster to determine the unfamiliarity of those faces relative to previously unseen faces. This interaction was not found for famous faces. Since in the present studies familiarity and famousness were correlated, at this juncture {{it is not clear whether}} the results will hold for familiar but not famous individuals.

40|$|Parkinson’s disease (PD) is {{characterized}} by motor symptoms, such as resting tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity, but also features non-motor complications. PD patients taking dopaminergic therapy, such as levodopa but especially dopamine agonists (DAs), evidence an increase in impulse control disorders, suggesting a link between dopaminergic therapy and impulsive pursuit of pleasurable activities. However, impulsivity is a multifaceted construct. Motor impulsivity refers to the inability to overcome automatic responses or cancel pre-potent responses. Previous {{research has suggested that}} PD patients, on dopaminergic medications, have decreased motor impulsivity. Whether effects on impulsivity are main effects of dopaminergic therapies or are specific to PD is unclear. Using a <b>Go</b> <b>No-go</b> task, we investigated the effect of a single dose of the DA pramipexole on motor impulsivity in healthy participants. The <b>Go</b> <b>No-go</b> task consisted of Go trials, for which keystroke responses were made as quickly as possible, and lesser frequency No-go trials, on which motor responses were to be inhibited. We hypothesized that pramipexole would decrease motor impulsivity. This would manifest as a) fewer No-go errors (i. e., fewer responses on trials in which a response ought to have been inhibited) and b) more timed-out Go trials (i. e., more trials on which the deadline elapsed before a decision to make a keystroke occurred). Healthy volunteers were treated with either 0. 5 mg of pramipexole or a standard placebo (randomly determined). During the two-hour wait period, they completed demographic, cognitive, physiological, and affective measures. The pramipexole group had significantly more Go timeouts (p< 0. 05) compared to the placebo group though they did not differ in percent of No-go errors. In contrast to its effect on pursuit of pleasurable activities, pramipexole did not increase motor impulsivity. In fact, in line with findings in PD and addiction, dopaminergic therapy might increase motor impulse control. In these patient groups, by enhancing function of the dorsal striatum of the basal ganglia in contrast to its effect on impulsive pursuit of pleasurable activities. These findings have implications for use and effects of pramipexole in PD as well as in other conditions (e. g., restless leg, dystonia, depression, addiction-related problems) ...|$|R

In addition, neutral implicit attitudes were found when attitudes were assessed in the context of ordinary or organic foods, again contrasting with our hypotheses. These results imply that implicit attitudes towards GM food are more positive than anticipated and may lead to approach behaviour towards such products. Thus, given the choice, consumers are likely to accept GM food although other incentives may be needed if alternative foods are available...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{functional}} {{components of}} the human motor system {{that are used to}} retrieve and execute simple intransitive hand gestures were identified with a repetition suppression (RS) paradigm. Partici-pants performed movements with the right hand to text instructions in a rapid event related design with a pseudo-random stimulus order. Brain areas associated with action retrieval were identified by comparing trials where an action was repeated to trials that involved a new action. Performance of a novel action, collapsed across individual actions, resulted in significantly greater activity in a left hemi-sphere predominant fronto-parietal circuit involving inferior frontal gyrus and inferior parietal cortex (supramarginal gyrus). This is consistent with previous action retrieval tasks using <b>go,</b> <b>no-go</b> para-digms and lesion studies of patients with apraxia that emphasize a role of these areas in action organi-zation. In addition, RS effects were present in left primary sensorimotor cortex. These effects cannot be ascribed to kinematic differences, simple action related activity or differences of cognitive set.

40|$|Neuroimaging and {{computational}} modeling {{studies have}} led to the suggestion that response conflict monitoring by the anterior cingulate cortex {{plays a key role in}} cognitive control. For example, response conflict is high when a response must be withheld (no-go) in contexts in which there is a prepotent tendency to make an overt (go) response. An event-related brain potential (ERP) component, the N 2, is more pronounced on <b>no-go</b> than on <b>go</b> trials and was previously thought to reflect the need to inhibit the go response. However, the N 2 may instead reflect the high degree of response conflict on no-go trials. If so, an N 2 should also be apparent when subjects make a go response in conditions in which no-go events are more common. To test this hypothesis, we collected high-density ERP data from 12 18 - 24 -year-olds performing a go/no-go task, in which the relative frequency of <b>go</b> versus <b>no-go</b> stimuli was varied. Consistent with our hypothesis, an N 2 was apparent on both <b>go</b> and <b>no-go</b> trials and showed the properties expected of an ERP measure of conflict detection on correct trials: (1) It was enhanced for low-frequency stimuli, irrespective of whether these stimuli were associated with generating or suppressing a response, and (2) it was localized to the anterior cingulate cortex [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Computer-based {{assessment}} of many cognitive processes (eg, anticipatory and response readiness processes) requires {{the use of}} invariant stimulus display times (SDT) and intertrial intervals (ITI). Although designs with invariant SDTs and ITIs have been used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research, such designs are problematic for fMRI studies because of collinearity issues. This study examined regressor modulation with trial-level reaction times (RT) as a method for improving signal detection in a <b>go</b> / <b>no-go</b> task with invariant SDTs and ITIs. The effects of modulating the go regressor were evaluated with respect to the detection of BOLD signal-change for the no-go condition. BOLD signal-change to no-go stimuli was examined when the go regressor was based on a (a) canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF), (b) RT-based amplitude-modulated (AM) HRF, and (c) RT-based amplitude and duration modulated (A&DM) HRF. Reaction time–based modulation reduced the collinearity between the <b>go</b> and <b>no-go</b> regressors, with A&DM producing the greatest reductions in correlations between the regressors, and greater reductions in the correlations between regressors were associated with longer mean RTs and greater RT variability. Reaction time–based modulation increased statistical power for detecting group-level no-go BOLD signal-change across a broad set of brain regions. The findings show the efficacy of using regressor modulation to increase power in detecting BOLD signal-change in fMRI studies in which circumstances dictate the use of temporally invariant stimulus presentations...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that {{individual differences in}} tendency to overeat relate to impulsivity, possibly by increasing reactivity to food-related cues in the environment. This study tested whether acute exposure to food cues enhanced impulsive and risky responses in women classified on tendency to overeat, indexed by scores on the three factor eating questionnaire disinhibition (TFEQ-D), restraint (TFEQ-R) and hunger scales. Ninety six healthy women completed two measures of impulsive responding (delayed discounting, DDT and a <b>Go</b> <b>No-Go,</b> GNG, task) and a measure of risky decision making (the balloon analogue risk task, BART) as well as questionnaire measures of impulsive behaviour either after looking at a series of pictures of food or visually matched controls. Impulsivity (DDT) and risk-taking (BART) were both positively associated with TFEQ-D scores, but in both cases this effect was exacerbated by prior exposure to food cues. No effects of restraint were found. TFEQ-D scores were also related to more commission errors on the GNG, while restrained women were slower on the GNG, but neither effect was modified by cue exposure. Overall {{these data suggest that}} exposure to food cues act to enhance general impulsive responding in women at risk of overeating and tentatively suggest an important interaction between tendency for impulsive decision making and food cues that may help explain a key underlying risk factor for overeating...|$|R

Here we used implicit measures in order to (i) examine implicit evaluative and arousal associations with SH (ii) compare the discriminatory power of implicit and explicit attitude measures in a non-clinical sample {{at high risk of}} SH. MethodsTwo experiments using <b>Go</b> <b>No-Go</b> Association (GNAT) tasks designed to tap implicit attitudes toward SH in an undergraduate sample. ResultsIn Study One logistic regression analysis demonstrated that explicit, rather than implicit measures successfully discriminated between SH cases and controls which contrasts with previous research. Faster reaction times were observed for negative implicit associations (SH and ‘I dislike’) compared to positive implicit associations (SH and ‘I like’) for both SH cases and controls. The SH group were faster to respond to arousal implicit associations compared to implicit sedation associations. Study Two extended this finding to demonstrate associations between evaluative/arousal GNATs and self-reported functions of SH. Internal motivations for self harmful behaviour were significantly related to an implicit sedation association with SH, whereas interpersonal motivations were associated with an implicit arousal association with SH. These findings are consonant with existing functional accounts of SH. LimitationsLongitudinal data is necessary to identify whether the attitudes assessed could predict future SH. ConclusionsThe findings provide novel experimental support for the hypothesised role of automatic/affect regulation and social/interpersonal functions of SH.

However, in studies using go/no-go tasks, findings regarding the presence of response inhibition deficits in nicotine-dependent individuals are mixed. This might be due to differences between studies on a number of task parameters. Here we aimed to identify task conditions under which go/no-go task performance deficits can be observed in smokers and to characterize the nature of such deficits. Sixty-one male students (30 smokers, 31 non-smokers) performed a go/no-go task while independently manipulating three task parameters: (1) percentage no-go trials (50 % or 25 %), (2) stimulus presentation time (600 ms or 200 ms), and (3) nature of no-go stimuli (cigarette related or cigarette unrelated). Three measures, reaction time on go trials and percentage correct responses on <b>go</b> and <b>no-go</b> trials, served as performance indicators. Under 200 -ms but not 600 -ms stimulus presentation conditions, the smokers responded faster on go trials and made more errors on both <b>go</b> and <b>no-go</b> trials than the non-smokers did. These differences occurred irrespective of the percentage of no-go trials and nature of no-go stimuli. The accuracy differences disappeared after controlling for the response time differences, suggesting a strong speed-accuracy trade-off. This study contributes to unraveling the conditions under which smokers display impaired inhibition performance and helps to characterize the nature of this impairment. Under task conditions prompting fast responding, smokers are more prone to increase response speed and to make more errors than non-smokers...|$|R
