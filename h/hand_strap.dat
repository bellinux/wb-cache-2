5|$|Tests {{exist to}} measure how much {{sensation}} a person has retained in the genitals after an injury, which are used to tailor treatment or rehabilitation. Sensory testing helps people learn to recognize the sensations associated with arousal and orgasm. Injured people {{who are able to}} achieve orgasms from stimulation to the genitals may need stimulation for a longer time or at a greater intensity. Sex toys such as vibrators are available, e.g. to enhance sensation in areas of reduced sensitivity, and these can be modified to accommodate disabilities. For example, a <b>hand</b> <b>strap</b> can be added to a vibrator or dildo to assist someone with poor hand function.|$|E

50|$|In 1979 investigative {{reporter}} Roger Cook used the dispute with Lynsey de Paul to probe into Arden's controversial management style on BBC Radio 4's Checkpoint programme. This {{proved to be}} a colourful encounter. 'When you fight the champion you go 15 rounds, you've got to be prepared to go the whole way,' Arden tells Cook. 'I'll take you with one <b>hand</b> <b>strapped</b> up my arse. You're not a man, you're a creep.' Arden threatened to break the neck of anyone who talked to Cook in his on-air interview.|$|R
50|$|A human pony harness is {{used for}} bondage - which can be for restraint, {{decoration}} and/or to facilitate work such as pulling a cart. It is usually made of leather but can be rope, biothane or other appropriate material. It is wrapped (usually with buckles for adjustment) around the wearer's body {{in such a way}} that it cannot be slipped off. The wearer may have his/her <b>hands</b> <b>strapped</b> behind his/her back, although this is not usually recommended for pulling a cart or other work, in case of a fall. D-rings can be attached, so ropes or chains can be put on to lead the person around.|$|R
50|$|Day 31: Josef's actions earned John's ire, {{resulting}} in another shouting match between Anna and John, {{to the point}} of Josef punching the door to the confession room in anger. To calm Josef down, he was told to rejoin his fellow teen housemates. Later, Anna joined her nephew as per Big Brother's instructions after overhearing John's rants against her. Meanwhile, Ejay and Valerie continued gluing a shattered cup together again while their <b>hands</b> <b>strapped</b> to each other as punishment for shattering the cup the night before. In the evening, the teen housemates and Guardians moved back to their former bases. The teen housemates then held a discussion on how to help ease tensions among the Guardians.|$|R

50|$|The {{exterior}} of the 2000 series {{is different from the}} 8000 series with the unpainted stainless steel body wrapped by lines in the corporate colors, green and blue. The logo mark next to the doors on the 8000 series is not present. The carriage has been changed to the same core-type pneumatic rubber tires used on the 1000 series. The interior is also different from the 8000 series with warm-colored box seats in a 2+1 arrangement. It is also equipped with overhead baggage racks and blinds. As in the 8000 series there is piping on the ceiling above the entry/exit doors to substitute for <b>hand</b> <b>straps,</b> but its shape is different.

5000|$|In 1973, {{he created}} and {{presented}} the Radio 4 programme Checkpoint, which specialised in investigating and exposing criminals, con-men, injustice and official incompetence - and then confronting the wrong-doers on tape. [...] He {{is credited with}} creating a new genre of investigative reporting. One 1979 programme about notorious rock manager Don Arden {{proved to be a}} colourful encounter. 'When you fight the champion you go 15 rounds, you've got to be prepared to go the whole way,' Arden tells Cook: 'I'll take you with one <b>hand</b> <b>strapped</b> up my arse. You're not a man, you're a creep. You’ll be served with a writ shortly. If you want to dig up dirt about me, I’ll take your last five pounds for doing it.' The promised legal action never happened and Arden's career subsequently went into decline.|$|R
5000|$|The Guitar grip {{controller}} comes packaged {{with the}} game Guitar Hero: On Tour and is plugged into the GBA game slot. It features four colored buttons just like the ones {{that can be found}} on regular Guitar Hero guitar controllers for the stationary consoles, though it lacks the fifth orange button found on the guitar controllers. The DS Guitar Hero controller comes with a small [...] "pick-stylus" [...] (which is shaped like a guitar pick, as the name suggests) that can be put away into a small slot on the controller. It also features a <b>hand</b> <b>strap.</b> The game works with both the DS Lite and the original Nintendo DS as it comes with an adapter for the original DS. It is not compatible with the DSi or 3DS, {{due to the lack of}} GBA slot. The Guitar Grip also works with its sequels, Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades, Guitar Hero On Tour: Modern Hits, and Band Hero.|$|E
40|$|Distracted driving {{involving}} secondary tasks {{is known}} to lead to an increased likelihood {{of being involved in}} motor vehicle crashes. Some secondary tasks are unnecessary and should never be performed. But other secondary tasks, e. g., operating the defroster, are critical to safe driving. Ideally, the driver should schedule when to perform the critical tasks such that the likelihood of a hazard materializing is relatively small during the performance of the secondary task. The current study evaluates a training program [...] STRAP (Secondary Task Regulatory 2 ̆ 6 Anticipatory Program) [...] which is designed to make drivers aware of latent hazards in the hope that they regulate engagement in secondary tasks which they are performing at the time the latent hazard appears. The secondary tasks include both tasks that require drivers to take their eyes off the road (e. g., operating the defroster) and those which do not (e. g., cell phone use). Participants were assigned either to STRAP or placebo training. After training, the groups navigated eight different scenarios on a driving simulator and were instructed to engage during the drive in as many secondary tasks as possible as long as they felt safe to do so. Secondary task engagement was fully user paced. It {{is important to note that}} drivers receiving STRAP training were never instructed directly to either disengage from or not engage in secondary tasks when encountering latent hazards. The results show that STRAP trained drivers were more likely to detect latent hazards and associated clues than placebo trained drivers. With regards to secondary task engagement, STRAP trained drivers chose to limit their in-vehicle and cell phone task engagement by focusing on the forward roadway rather than the task at <b>hand.</b> <b>STRAP</b> training holds out the promise of providing individuals with the necessary skills and proactive awareness to make safe decisions regarding the non-performance or interruption of a secondary task in the presence of a potential latent hazard...|$|E

There are also straps {{above and below the}} bellows to keep it securely closed when the instrument is not playing.|$|R
50|$|A 1998 {{study found}} that random {{physical}} punishment (not proper formal corporal punishment) was being used extensively by teachers in Egypt to punish behavior they regarded as unacceptable. Around 80% of the boys and 60% of the girls were punished by teachers, using their <b>hands,</b> sticks, <b>straps,</b> shoes, punches and kicks as most common methods of administration. The most common reported injuries were bumps and contusions.|$|R
60|$|She {{took him}} to her own chamber, and, still holding him by the hand as if she feared to lose him for an instant, {{gathered}} together the little stock she had, and hung her basket on her arm.

50|$|For {{a period}} {{leading up to}} Remembrance Day {{artificial}} poppies are worn by {{many people in the}} United Kingdom and Canada to commemorate those killed in war. When worn in uniform the plastic stem of the poppy is discarded and the paper petals are fitted behind the beret badge where a metal cap badge is worn. On forage caps the paper petals are fitted under the left <b>hand</b> chin <b>strap</b> button.|$|R
50|$|Cuff {{assignment}} badges to {{officers are}} hand embroidered and made from gold-colloured metallic tissue. In accordance with ZDv 37/10 on dark-blue shoulder <b>straps</b> <b>hand</b> embroidered naval stars, made from gold-coloured metallic tissue, are tolerated as well.|$|R

50|$|The {{season began}} with George Heppell in goal, as Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club at first {{refused to allow}} Jepson to play. With three defeats {{in the first four}} games, most of the new men were dropped, as Morgan {{struggled}} to find consistency in his picks. It took until the end of October for the team to get into their stride, as their 5-1 win over Walsall was their fifth consecutive home win. They also travelled to St James Park to record a 3-1 win over Exeter City - their first away win since September 1937. Nottinghamshire CCC seemed justified in initially refusing Jepson permission to play, as he played seventy minutes of the game with his right <b>hand</b> <b>strapped</b> up, having dislocated his fingers. Ken Fish was then sold to BSC Young Boys of Switzerland, having fallen out of favour; yet the directors refused to hear offers {{for the rest of the}} team, determined as they were to strengthen the team. Despite stylish play, especially from Alf Bellis, the club then went from Guy Fawkes Night to New Year's Eve without a victory, their five defeats taking them to just two points clear of the re-election zone. Ending their run with a 4-0 win over Bristol City, they lost Jack Roberts to a dislocated shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|Very cross was Harold as he twitched the bridle out of Ellen's <b>hand,</b> {{threw the}} <b>strap</b> of the letter-bag round his neck, and gave such a re-echoing {{switch to the}} poor pony, that Alfred heard it up-stairs, and started up to call out, 'For shame, Harold!' ...|$|R
50|$|Plastic {{handcuffs}} (also called PlastiCuffs or FlexiCuffs, flex cuffs or Double Cuffs) are a form {{of physical}} restraint for the <b>hands,</b> using plastic <b>straps.</b> They function as handcuffs but are cheaper and easier to carry than metal handcuffs, but they cannot be reused. The device was first introduced in 1965.|$|R
50|$|The opening {{ten minutes}} {{of the first half}} passed with the scores tied at 18, but a lay-up and free-throw from Clark and a three-pointer by Bontrager {{suddenly}} opened a 26-18 lead for Kingston. Strong's lay-up brought it back to 26-20 before Irish entered the game with a <b>strapped</b> <b>hand</b> 7 minutes 10 seconds from half-time.|$|R
50|$|Scottish public (state) schools {{used the}} tawse to punish pupils of either {{sex on the}} palm of the outstretched hand. Pupils were usually {{instructed}} to hold out one hand, palm uppermost, supported by the other hand below, which {{made it difficult to}} move the hand away during the infliction of the strokes. It also ensured that the full force of each stroke was taken by the <b>hand</b> being <b>strapped.</b> The punishment was usually inflicted by the class teacher in front of the class, to act as a deterrent to others; sometimes by a designated teacher, such as the Deputy Headmaster, to whom the pupil was sent.|$|R

If you can't strap a 'orse {{without a}} stick in your <b>hand,</b> don't you <b>strap</b> him at all, you--" [...] Then there came a volley of abuse out of the Captain's mouth, {{in the middle of}} which the man threw down the rubber he was using and walked away.|$|R
5000|$|A long backboard, {{also called}} a long spine board (LSB), is a reinforced, firm surface with several <b>hand</b> and <b>strap</b> holes along its lateral edges. [...] Other {{immobilization}} equipment consists of straps, or cravats, and cervical immobilization devices (CIDs). CIDs, which stabilize {{the neck and}} reduce movement, include a soft or rigid cervical spine immobilization collar, also called a c-collar or neck brace. [...] In addition to the c-collar, commercial head supports or substituted items, such as bulky blankets, rolled towels, or foam head blocks, are placed {{on each side of}} the head and then secured to the backboard with tape. [...] Straps are used to secure the torso (chest and pelvis) and extremities (arms and legs) to the backboard.|$|R
60|$|For some incomprehensible reason, John Jago {{seemed to}} be ill at ease in the {{presence}} of his young countrywoman. He looked up at Naomi doubtingly from his plate, and looked down again slowly with a frown. When I addressed him, he answered constrainedly. Even when he spoke to Mr. Meadowcroft, he was still on his guard--on his guard against the two young men, as I fancied by the direction which his eyes took on these occasions. When we began our meal, I had noticed {{for the first time that}} Silas Meadowcroft's left <b>hand</b> was <b>strapped</b> up with surgical plaster; and I now further observed that John Jago's wandering brown eyes, furtively looking at everybody round the table in turn, looked with a curious, cynical scrutiny at the young man's injured hand.|$|R
