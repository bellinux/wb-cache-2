5|$|The New York Times printed two {{versions}} of the raids on its front page, one by David Halberstam implicating Nhu for the attacks, and another with the official government version. Sheehan of United Press International also claimed Nhu was responsible for the attacks, and foreign journalists had to smuggle their stories out by asking people leaving the country at the airport to carry documents for them. At the time, Sheehan and Halberstam were on a Ngô family <b>hit</b> <b>list</b> along with political dissidents because of their exposes of the regime's human rights abuses, and following the raids, they slept at the home of John Mecklin, a U.S. official.

25|$|After Charles Manson incited {{the murder}} of five people, {{including}} McQueen's friends Sharon Tate and Jay Sebring, at Tate's home on August 9, 1969, it was reported McQueen was a potential target of the killers. According to his first wife, McQueen began carrying a handgun at all times in public, including at Sebring's funeral. Two months after the murders, police found a <b>hit</b> <b>list</b> with McQueen's name on it, a result of McQueen's company having rejected a Manson screenplay. In 2011, {{it was revealed that}} Sebring had invited McQueen to the party at Tate's house {{on the night of the}} murders. According to McQueen, he had invited a girlfriend to come along, but she instead suggested an intimate night at home, which probably saved his life.|$|E
25|$|Within {{hours of}} Cahill's murder, the Provisional IRA claimed {{responsibility}} {{in a press}} release. The reasons cited were Cahill's alleged involvement with a Portadown unit of the Ulster Volunteer Force. The unit in question had attempted a bomb attack on a south Dublin pub which was hosting a Sinn Féin fund-raiser on 21 May 1994. The UVF operatives were halted by the doorman Martin Doherty. In the ensuing struggle Doherty, who the IRA subsequently announced was a volunteer in their Dublin Brigade, was shot dead. The Provisionals further alleged that Cahill {{had been involved in}} selling the stolen Beit paintings to the UVF gang led by Billy Wright. The UVF then fenced the paintings for money, which they used to buy guns from South Africa. This act supposedly sealed Cahill's fate, and put him at the top of an IRA <b>hit</b> <b>list.</b> In a later statement, the IRA said that it was Cahill's involvement with and assistance to pro-British death squads which forced us to act.|$|E
25|$|Both Byron and Sheela {{testified in}} the case: Byron testified that her money was a loan to the {{organization}} to purchase land in India, and Sheela that the money was a donation {{to the organization}}. A survey submitted by the Rajneesh organization in the case was deemed unreliable by the judge because the survey had been conducted by volunteers who were also members of the organization. The jury decided in favor of Byron, and awarded her her money plus punitive damages. Subsequent to the jury decision, Ma Anand Sheela and an inner circle of followers of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh at Rajneeshpuram compiled a <b>hit</b> <b>list</b> of people they planned to murder, including both Helen and Barbara Byron, as well as United States Attorney Charles Turner and Oregon Attorney General David Frohnmayer.
