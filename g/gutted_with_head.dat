It is essentially a fish that has been scaled, gutted and deboned by a skilled worker before being reassembled with a transglutaminase to look like a dressed fish (fish <b>gutted</b> and <b>with</b> its <b>head</b> and fins removed). The fish is then flash-frozen and packaged, remaining uncooked.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a simple mechanism in a supersymmetric <b>GUT</b> <b>with</b> an extra reverse doublet-triplet splitting near the GUT scale, where {{the mass of}} an extra doublet {{is greater than the}} mass of an extra triplet by a few orders of magnitude.

R-parity is conserved implying a stable LSP which can explain the dark matter of the universe. The neutrino mass problem may be solved by type I or type III see-saw mechanism.
