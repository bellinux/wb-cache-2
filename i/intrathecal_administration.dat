50|$|Baclofen, {{diazepam}} and dantrolene {{remain the}} three most commonly used pharmacologic agents {{in the treatment of}} spastic hypertonia. Baclofen is generally the drug of choice for spinal cord types of spasticity, while sodium dantrolene is the only agent which acts directly on muscle tissue. Tizanidine is also available. Phenytoin with chlorpromazine may be potentially useful if sedation does not limit their use. Ketazolam, not yet available in the United States, may be a significant addition to the pharmacologic armamentarium. <b>Intrathecal</b> <b>administration</b> of antispastic medications allows for high concentrations of drug near the site of action, which limits side effects.|$|E

40|$|Opioid {{analgesia}} is {{the primary}} pharmacologic intervention for managing pain. However, opioids can cause various adverse effects including pruritus, nausea, constipation, and sedation. Respiratory depression is the most fatal side effect. Therefore, cautious monitoring of respiratory status must be done after opioid administration. Here, we report a patient who suffered from respiratory depression with deep sedation and aspiration pneumonitis after <b>intrathecal</b> morphine <b>administration.</b> (Korean J Pain 2012; 25 : 126 - 129) Key Words: intrathecal, morphine, pneumonitis. Implantable intrathecal morphine pumps have been increasingly used in patients with intractable chronic pain [1, 2]. Prior to making the decision to implant an ITMP, a trial <b>administration</b> of <b>intrathecal</b> morphine {{should be done to}} estimate the effective dose and to determine any untoward side effects from the morphine.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a patient with}} an acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) previously treated with two courses of cytarabin, idarubicin and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), who presented a medullary and meningeal relapse after 8 months of complete remission. A diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) involvement {{was based on the}} appearance of APL blasts in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was negative. The neurological symptoms were not evident at the time of recognition of the medullary recurrence, but appeared a few days later, when the patient had already received a reinduction treatment. When the CSF was first examined, showing atypical promyelocytes, there was no excess of blasts on bone-marrow examination. The patient was treated with ATRA and <b>intrathecal</b> <b>administrations</b> of cytoxic drugs, achieving a complete long-lasting CNS remission. The appearance of mature myeloid cells in the CSF during this treatment suggested a possible differentiating effect of ATRA towards extramedullary relapse...|$|R
50|$|Accidental {{injection}} of vinca alkaloids into the spinal canal (<b>intrathecal</b> <b>administration)</b> is highly dangerous, with a mortality rate approaching 100 percent. The medical literature documents cases of ascending paralysis due to massive encephalopathy and spinal nerve demyelination, accompanied by intractable pain, almost uniformly leading to death. Several patients have survived after aggressive and immediate intervention. Rescue treatments consist of washout of the cerebrospinal fluid and administration of protective medications.Children may do better following this injury. One child, who was aggressively treated {{at the time}} of the injection, recovered almost completely with only mild neurological deficits.A significant series of inadvertent intrathecal vincristine administration occurred in China in 2007 when batches of cytarabine and methotrexate (both often used intrathecally) manufactured by the company Shanghai Hualian were found to be contaminated with vincristine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Intrathecal</b> <b>{{administration}}</b> is a {{route of}} administration for drugs via an injection into the spinal canal, or into the subarachnoid space so that it reaches the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and is useful in spinal anaesthesia, chemotherapy, or pain management applications. This route {{is also used to}} introduce drugs that fight certain infections, particularly post-neurosurgical. The drug needs to be given this way to avoid being stopped by the blood brain barrier. The same drug given orally must enter the blood stream and {{may not be able to}} pass out and into the brain. Drugs given by the intrathecal route often have to be made up specially by a pharmacist or technician because they cannot contain any preservative or other potentially harmful inactive ingredients that are sometimes found in standard injectable drug preparations.|$|E
50|$|LXA4 and 15-epi-LXA4 inhibit chemotaxis, transmigration, {{superoxide}} generation, NF-κB activation, and/or {{generation of}} pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL8, IL13, IL12, and IL5) by neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, Innate lymphoid cells, and/or macrophages, {{as well as}} suppress proliferation and production of IgM and IgG antibodies by B lymphocytes. These actions appear to involve stimulating anti-inflammatory signaling pathways, but also blocking the actions of other ALX/FPR ligands which simulate pro-inflammatory pathways. Transgenic mice made to overexpress ALX/FPR exhibit markedly reduced inflammatory responses to diverse insults. LXA4 and 15-epi-LXA4, when introduced by <b>Intrathecal</b> <b>administration</b> into rodents, suppress the perception of inflammatory pain; this action may involve the ALX/FPR receptor shown to be present on the spinal astrocytes of test animal and, based on studies using 15-epi-LXA, inhibition of the NALP1 inflammasome signaling complex.|$|E

50|$|Sedative {{actions of}} benzodiazepines limit their {{usefulness}} as analgesic agents {{and they are}} therefore generally {{not considered to be}} appropriate. This limitation can be bypassed by <b>intrathecal</b> <b>administration.</b> GABAA receptors in the periaqueductal gray are pro-nociceptive at supraspinal sites while GABAA that are found in the spinal cord are anti-hyperalgesic. Spinal α2 and α3 containing GABAA receptors are responsible for the anti-hyperalgesic action of intrathecal diazepam. This was shown when the anti-hyperalgesic action was reduced when administered in α2 and α3 mice in inflammatory pain and in neuropathic pain. Additionally, studies in α5 mice showed that the spinal α5-containing GABAA receptor has a minor role in inflammatory pain. An α2, α3 and/or α5 selective positive allosteric agonist, like L-838,427 for example, might be useful as an analgesic drug against inflammatory or neuropathic pain.|$|E
50|$|This {{device is}} {{implanted}} over the sacral anterior root ganglia of the spinal cord; controlled by an external transmitter, it delivers intermittent stimulation which improves {{the ability to}} empty the bladder. It may also assist in defecation and also may enable male patients to have a sustained full erection. The device is implanted {{in one of two}} regions, either through <b>intrathecal</b> <b>administration</b> or extradurally. It is often performed in conjunction with a dorsal rhizotomy, and many groups believe that the best results are only seen when this procedure is performed alongside the implantation. The rhizotomy will remove sensory reflexes, which in men may include sexual reflexes. For some patients this is a major drawback to the device. For others, the benefits outweigh the downside. The related procedure of sacral nerve stimulation is to control incontinence in otherwise able-bodied patients.|$|E
50|$|Intrathecal pumps {{offer much}} lower doses of {{baclofen}} {{because they are}} designed to deliver the medication directly to the spinal fluid rather than going through the digestive and blood system first. They are often preferred in spasticity patients such as those with spastic diplegia, as very little of the oral dose actually reaches the spinal fluid. Besides those with spasticity, <b>intrathecal</b> <b>administration</b> is also used in patients with multiple sclerosis who have severe painful spasms which are not controllable by oral baclofen. With pump administration, a test dose is first injected into the spinal fluid to assess the effect, and if successful in relieving spasticity, a chronic intrathecal catheter is inserted from the spine through the abdomen and attached to the pump which is implanted under the abdomen's skin, usually by the ribcage. The pump is computer-controlled for automatic dosage and the reservoir in the pump can be replenished by percutaneous injection. The pump also has to be replaced about every 5 years due to the battery life and other wear.|$|E

Assessments commenced 2 h after the opioid injection and continued for 20 h. Pain, analgesic effect, supplementary analgesic requirements and adverse effects were noted. Intrathecal diamorphine {{was unable to}} delay the initial perception of discomfort. It was, however, capable of postponing the onset of severe pain requiring analgesic supplementation (control 5. 25 h vs approximately 8 h: P less than 0. 05).

5000|$|NK1 agonism induced {{hypersensitivity}} {{is dependent}} on 5-HT3 receptors, and modulated by GABAA and NMDA receptors as well. Animals were pretreated with spinally administered Y-25130 or ondansetron, both 5-HT3 antagonists, before having RVM injections of SP. Both Y-25130 and ondansetron inhibited SP-induced thermal hyperalgesia. GABAA receptor involvement was demonstrated by <b>intrathecal</b> <b>administration</b> of gabazine, a GABAA antagonist, in animals receiving continuous infusions of SP into the RVM. Gabazine treatment completely reversed the thermal hyperalgesia. The mechanism behind GABA involvement was investigated using in vitro recordings from animals treated with continuous infusions of SP or saline into the RVM. In SP-treated neurons, GABA evoked depolarization, whereas, in saline-treated neurons, it caused hyperpolarization. [...] "These results suggest that descending facilitation induced by RVM SP administration produces GABAA receptor-evoked depolarization {{and an increase in}} excitation of dorsal horn neurons." [...] Next, the GABA A agonist muscimol was tested in conjuncture with SP. Intrathecal muscimol significantly enhanced SP-induced hypersensitivity, which was blocked by intrathecal gabazine. Next, the researchers looked at threonine phosphorylation of NKCC1 proteins, which are an isoform of the Na-K-Cl cotransporter. Phosphorylation of these proteins results in increase activity of the cotransporter. Chronic administration of RVM SP or acute SP combined with intrathecal muscimol resulted in significantly higher levels of phosphorylated NKCC1.|$|E
40|$|The anti-nociceptive {{effects of}} three {{tricyclic}} anti-depressants (desipramine, protriptyline, fluoxetine) were evaluated in mice following <b>intrathecal</b> <b>administration.</b> Nociceptive behavior {{was produced by}} <b>intrathecal</b> <b>administration</b> of Substance P and measured for 60 seconds following subcutaneous and <b>intrathecal</b> <b>administration</b> of vehicle and increasing doses of the drugs being tested.

40|$|Isolated leptomeningeal {{recurrence}} of melanoma is rare, occurring in 2 % {{of patients with}} central nervous system involvement secondary to melanoma. The optimal treatment of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LMC) in melanoma {{has not yet been}} determined and remains a major challenge. We report a melanoma patient who presented with isolated LMC {{in the form of a}} new-onset weakness of the lower limbs, paresthesia of the left hand and foot, lumbago and headache. A lumbar puncture and spinal MRI confirmed LMC. The patient was treated with temozolomide 75 mg/m 2 /day on a 4 weeks on/ 2 weeks off schedule. After an initial transient clinical deterioration, the patient showed a complete radiological response as well as a dramatic improvement in quality of life. The encouraging clinical response reported here suggests that dose-intensified temozolomide might have significant activity in the treatment of leptomeningeal dissemination of melanoma and may be a valid treatment option for patients who have not been previously exposed to this agent. Moreover, this treatment regimen is extremely well tolerated and obviates the need for repeated <b>intrathecal</b> <b>administrations</b> of chemotherapeutic agents, which are often not well tolerated by patients who have significant co-morbidities due to their disease.
