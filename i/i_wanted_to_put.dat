We all hopped upon that cloud, and the cloud took us away , and we made this album, and we landed when it was done." [...] In a Rolling Stone interview in 1972, Morrison told John Grissim, Jr.: [...] "I was really pretty happy with the album. [...] The only complaint I had was that it was rather rushed. [...] But I thought it was closer to the type of music <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> out. [...] And still is, actually." ...|$|E
500|$|Blackhill Enterprises {{provided}} a [...] high stage, with the speakers being {{housed in a}} thirty-foot-high tower so that people {{at the far end}} of the park would be able to hear the music. The stage was flanked by palm trees in pots and behind the performers there was a blowup of the cover of the Beggars Banquet album. Richards had started experimenting with open tunings by this point in the band's career, particularly after hearing Ry Cooder, and the Hyde Park gig was the first chance audiences got to hear them. He played a Gibson ES-330 tuned to open E tuning with a capo on the fourth fret, and a Gibson Flying V. Taylor, meanwhile, played a Gibson Les Paul for the opening number, followed by an SG for the majority of the set. The PA system was supplied by Watkins Electric Music, who already handled amplification at previous Hyde Park shows. Company founder Charlie Watkins recalls it was the largest PA he had assembled to that point and, unable to provide enough gear himself, he was forced to borrow extras from other groups, later saying, [...] "I didn't have many columns, but <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> 1500W up. I borrowed some from T-Rex. They all chipped in — that's what we used to do." ...|$|E

500|$|De Vries, who {{had worked}} on the demo, asked Orbit to help produce the song, and was enlisted. According to [...] writer Lucy O'Brien, De Vries and Orbit had {{originally}} composed and produced the track before Ray of Light had been conceived. During the sessions, Orbit found De Vries' contribution [...] "off-putting", to which the latter confessed, [...] "On all the collaborations I'd left {{a lot of space}} for him, but for this <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> something on the table and say, 'This is what I think'". De Vries had added electronic noise frequencies during the first chorus of the song, stating that he had a [...] "vision on how the song should be finished". Orbit did not like the addition since it sounded to him that the [...] "DAT's broken". De Vries defended his contribution saying that {{it was supposed to be}} [...] "like that [...] It's quite slow for a dance tune of that nature, not a pacey tune." [...] Madonna had enjoyed all three of their contributions to the track, and as a result, Orbit reluctantly left it on. In J. Randy Taraborrelli's book , the singer said that the main inspiration behind [...] "Nothing Really Matters" [...] and [...] "The Power of Good-Bye" [...] from the same album, was other people judging and dissecting her creative process.

500|$|What Love Is Made Of" [...] was premiered during Irish DJ Annie Mac's eponymous {{program on}} BBC Radio 1, on 10 May 2013, though its digital {{download}} only occurred on 5 July 2013. It was serviced as an extended play, {{where it was}} bundled with three remixes, by MK (Mark Kinchen), Felix da Housecat and Brackles. The song was ultimately excluded from Katy's second studio album, entitled Little Red. During an interview with Clash, Katy was asked about why she had not included the song in the album's track listing. To that question, she responded: [...] "I just felt that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> some music out there, really. Like, 'Aaliyah' from Danger EP is on the album, but I loved collaborating with Jessie Ware. But [...] {{means a lot to}} me , so I wanted to get it out there, regardless of whether it was on the album." [...] Having a length of three minutes and fifty-five seconds (3:55), [...] "What Love Is Made Of" [...] is an uptempo dance and house track that has been described as [...] "rave-y" [...] and [...] "trance-y". Its instrumentation contains the sounds of pianos and synthesizers. Jordan Sargent of Spin observed that it continued the musical style first introduced in Katy's 2012 extended play (EP), Danger EP, which was [...] "straight-forward house". Idolator's Sam Lansky compared her performance in the song to recording artist Siobhán Donaghy.|$|E
500|$|Argento {{said that}} Tenebrae was {{directly}} influenced by two distressing incidents that occurred 1980. On {{a break from}} filmmaking after Suspirias surprise success, Argento was spending time in Los Angeles, where an obsessed fan telephoned him repeatedly, to talk about Suspirias influence on him. According to Argento, the calls began pleasantly enough but before long became more insistent, eventually menacing. The fan claimed that he wanted [...] "to harm Argento {{in a way that}} reflected how much the director's work had affected him", and that because the director had [...] "ruined his life", he in turn wanted to ruin Argento's. Although no violence came of the threat, Argento said he found the experience understandably terrifying, and felt unable to write. At the advice of his producers, Argento fled to the coastal city of Santa Monica, where he felt safe enough to resume writing. However, after a few weeks the fan found Argento and resumed his calls, issuing more threats. The director decided to return to Italy. Argento felt the escalating nature of the fan's threats were [...] "symptomatic of that city of broken dreams" [...] with its [...] "celebrity stalkers and senseless crime". The second incident occurred during Argento's stay at The Beverly Hilton, where a Japanese tourist was shot dead in the hotel lobby. Later hearing of a drive-by shooting outside a local cinema, Argento reflected on the senselessness of the killings: [...] "To kill for nothing, that is the true horror of today... when that gesture has no meaning whatsoever it's completely repugnant, and that's the sort of atmosphere <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> across in Tenebrae." ...|$|E

500|$|Nick Offerman portrayed Ron Swanson, the {{director}} of the parks and recreation department, and Aubrey Plaza played April Ludgate, a sarcastic and uninterested college intern. [...] The part was written specifically for Plaza. After meeting her, [...] casting director Allison Jones told Schur, [...] "I just met the weirdest girl I've ever met in my life. You have to meet her and put her on your show." [...] Schur of meeting her, [...] "Aubrey came over to my office and made me feel really uncomfortable for like an hour, and immediately <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> her in the show," [...] although the writers were not immediately sure what direction her character would take. Rounding out the main cast was Paul Schneider, best known for his work in independent films such as Lars and the Real Girl and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. He was cast as Mark Brendanawicz, a city planner and Leslie's unrequited love interest. She still harbors feelings for Mark from a one-night sexual encounter years ago. Schneider said that early in the season he was insecure in the role because he was {{still trying to figure out}} the character's motivations. Chris Pratt played Andy Dwyer, Ann's well-intentioned but lazy and simple-minded boyfriend. Although Pratt appeared in every episode of season 1, he was credited as guest star until the second season, when he was promoted to the main cast. Andy was originally supposed to appear only in the first season, but the producers liked Pratt so much that, almost immediately after casting him, they decided to make Andy a regular character if the show was renewed.|$|E
500|$|Shortly before Christmas of 2011, Christopher Nolan invited several {{prominent}} directors, including Edgar Wright, Michael Bay, Bryan Singer, Jon Favreau, Eli Roth, Duncan Jones and Stephen Daldry, to Universal CityWalk's IMAX theatre {{for a private}} screening of the first six minutes of The Dark Knight Rises, which had been shot on IMAX film and edited from the original camera negative. Nolan, feeling {{that the use of}} film stock in cinema is currently being phased out due to the introduction of digital cinematography and projection, used this screening to make a case for the continued use of film, which he asserts still offers superior image quality to any digital format, and warned the filmmakers that unless they continued to assert their choice to use film in their productions, they may eventually lose it as an option. Nolan explained; [...] "I wanted to {{give them a chance to}} see the potential, because I think IMAX is the best film format that was ever invented. It's the gold standard and what any other technology has to match up to, but none have, in my opinion. The message <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> out there was that no one is taking anyone's digital cameras away. But if we want film to continue as an option, and someone is working on a big studio movie with the resources and the power to insist [...] film, they should say so. I felt as if I didn't say anything, and then we started to lose that option, it would be a shame. When I look at a digitally acquired and projected image, it looks inferior against an original negative anamorphic print or an IMAX one." ...|$|E

I {{had a whole}} idea {{of a piece of}} music that I really wanted to try and present to {{everybody}} and try and come to terms with. Bit difficult really, because it started on acoustic, and as you know it goes through to the electric parts. But we had various run-throughs [...] where I was playing the acoustic guitar and jumping up and picking up the electric guitar. Robert was sitting in the corner, or rather leaning against the wall, and as I was routining the rest of the band with this idea and this piece, he was just writing. And {{all of a sudden he}} got up and started singing, along with another run-through, and he must have had 80% of the words there ... I had these sections, and I knew what order they were going to go in, but it was just a matter of getting everybody to feel comfortable with each gear shift that was going to be coming.|$|E

That's all <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> in the song. I just thought that was so gangsta. It was kind of weird, too, now that I really think about it. She used to take her bullets out of the gun and leave the clip in her room and let me play with her gun. I {{was an only child}} so I probably got on her nerves that much that she finally gave me her burner, like, 'Here, get the fuck out my face.' [...] I {{just wanted to say that}} so bad." [...] He also added on how he incorporated one of his neighborhood friends on to the record: [...] " [...] speak on my homeboy Rat Tone. He's one of my big homies from my hood. He showed me my first [...] when I was like 11-years-old. I was amazed by it. I thought that shit was tight. They used to have all the shiny shit. That's how we talked. We would call a gun 'fly.' Like, 'Your dickies is cut super perfect and they got the right amount of dirt on them. That shit is fly." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gonet is an {{established}} actress in British television, {{known for her}} role in the 1990s BBC series The House of Eliott. Her casting as Jayne follows a trend of Holby City producers towards hiring established British actors - with Gonet joining a series 9 cast alongside former film actress Patsy Kensit as Ward Sister Faye Morton, comedian Adrian Edmondson as Consultant Surgeon Abra Durant and Jesus of Nazareth star Robert Powell as Nursing Consultant Mark Williams. Series creator Mal Young commented on the preference for established names when discussing Holby Citys inception, explaining: [...] "Soap actors are the best actors. There’s been so much snobbery before. The whole thing about typecasting was probably invented by actors who couldn’t get other work. From day one I knew <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> on screen people that viewers want to watch. There’s no downside to that." [...] Series producer Diana Kyle also addressed this trend in November 2007, when asked: [...] "When you cast an actor, do you actively seek out well-known names - like Jane Asher (Lady Byrne) and Patsy Kensit (Faye) - or will a role simply go to whoever's better suited?". She responded to this question: [...] "It's lovely when we have a new member of the cast come in and bring an audience with them. But we want the best actors, and the star names we cast are always the best - which is why we go for them!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Glass {{continued}} {{his work with}} a series of instrumental works, called [...] Another Look at Harmony [...] (1975–1977). For Glass this series demonstrated a new start, hence the title: [...] "What I was looking for was a way of combining harmonic progression with the rhythmic structure I had been developing, to produce a new overall structure. (...) I'd taken everything out with my early works and it was now time to decide just what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> in—a process that would occupy me for several years to come." [...] Parts 1 and 2 of [...] "Another Look at Harmony" [...] were included in a collaboration with Robert Wilson, a piece of musical theater later designated by Glass as the first opera of his portrait opera trilogy: Einstein on the Beach. Composed in spring to fall of 1975 in close collaboration with Wilson, Glass's first opera was first premiered in summer 1976 at the Festival d'Avignon, and in November of the same year to a mixed and partly enthusiastic reaction from the audience at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. Scored for the Philip Glass Ensemble, solo violin, chorus, and featuring actors (reciting texts by Christopher Knowles, Lucinda Childs and Samuel M. Johnson), Glass's and Wilson's essentially plotless opera was conceived as a [...] "metaphorical look at Albert Einstein: scientist, humanist, amateur musician—and the man whose theories (...) led to the splitting of the atom", evoking nuclear holocaust in the climactic scene, as critic Tim Page pointed out. As with Another Look at Harmony, [...] "Einstein added a new functional harmony that set it apart from the early conceptual works". Composer Tom Johnson came to the same conclusion, comparing the solo violin music to Johann Sebastian Bach, and the [...] "organ figures (...) to those Alberti basses Mozart loved so much". The piece was praised by The Washington Post as [...] "one of the seminal artworks of the century." ...|$|E
