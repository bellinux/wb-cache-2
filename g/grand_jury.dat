5|$|On Thursday, April 7, 2011, {{instead of}} {{pleading}} guilty, {{as had been}} expected based on the previous statements, the Garridos {{pleaded not guilty to}} charges of kidnapping and raping Dugard, as well as other charges, in an amended <b>Grand</b> <b>Jury</b> indictment. Phillip's attorney, public defender Susan Gellman, alleged that the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> might have been selected improperly and might have acted improperly. Gellman did not elaborate on her claim in the courtroom, but said outside that she had questions about the racial and geographic makeup of the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> that originally indicted the Garridos in September 2010. Judge Phimister noted that there were issues about the process itself before the <b>grand</b> <b>jury,</b> and also stated that the court would consider whether the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> acted appropriately. These developments were largely unforeseen by attorney Stephen Tapson, who represented Nancy; Tapson had said earlier that week that Phillip had made a deal with prosecutors to plead guilty and {{spend the rest of his}} life in prison. Gellman was upset with Tapson for telling reporters that her client had planned to plead guilty, saying that he should only speak about his own client, Nancy. Tapson said he found out about Gellman's plans only late on April 6. Neither attorney would elaborate further on the specific concerns about the <b>grand</b> <b>jury.</b> El Dorado, California District Attorney Vern Pierson said he did not think the complaints about the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> would ultimately derail the case against the Garridos.|$|E
5|$|Despite her confession, Wise {{pleaded not}} guilty to the charge of murdering Lily Gienke in front of a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> on March 23, 1925. She told the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> that she was irresistibly {{attracted}} to attending funerals, and that when there were not enough funerals in the community, she was driven to create them by killing. Wise was indicted on a charge of first-degree murder on April 7, 1925.|$|E
5|$|Spivey {{intended}} {{to return to}} the Wildcats once the situation was resolved, which Kentucky's athletic association expected before reinstatement. On February 16, 1952, he and the association's directors agreed to have him testify before a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> in New York. After Spivey's <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> appearance later in February, however, the university banned him permanently on March 2. In its statement, Kentucky's athletic board said evidence pointed to him fixing games during the 1950 Sugar Bowl Tournament. Gambler Jack West was charged with bribing two Wildcats players, Spivey and Walter Hirsch, to engage in point shaving during one of the tournament's games, and eventually pleaded guilty. In his <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> testimony, Spivey denied receiving $1,000 to shave points in games from December 1950 to January 1951, or talking about doing so with gamblers. In April, the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> indicted him on charges of perjury for lying under oath during his testimony, claiming he had done so on seven occasions.|$|E

The petition alleged that local and state officials violated the state's open meetings, conspiracy, and conflict of interest laws while planning the turnpike. The election board certified the petition as meeting the required threshold of 1,000 signatures on December 15. Work on the turnpike continued despite the investigation. After meeting for seven days, on January 19, 1990, the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> determined {{that there was no}} evidence to support the allegations and no need for further investigation.|$|E

5|$|On June 9, Spivey {{was arrested}} in New York, and was {{released}} pending a trial, which started in January 1953. Hirsch testified that Spivey asked to be included as a point shaver, and was upset that the payment {{for his role in}} shaving during the 1950 Sugar Bowl game was less than he anticipated. This, however, contradicted his original <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> testimony, which had no mention of Spivey's involvement. Hirsch also told the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> that Spivey and West, the ringleader, had not met. West declined to testify, leading to criminal contempt charges against him. Spivey again denied taking part in the scandal, stating that he had turned down a different gambler on two occasions. According to him, ex-teammate Jim Line mentioned his name to the grand jury; Spivey said he learned this from Line. The trial lasted for 13days before the case went to a jury. By a 9–3 margin, the majority of jurors supported acquittal for Spivey, and the hung jury caused a mistrial. The <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> eventually dropped the charges against Spivey.|$|E
