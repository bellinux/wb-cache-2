40|$|Graduation date: 2003 A regime-switching {{model for}} market {{integration}} study is extended to incorporate <b>dynamic</b> <b>trade</b> flow information and risk perceptions {{based on an}} expected utility framework. An application of the extended model to the US-China soybean markets analysis shows that: One, the positive arbitrage rent uncounted-for in the extended model has been substantially reduced compared to the results from previous models. Two, <b>dynamic</b> <b>trade</b> information modeling provides more accurate information about market integration conditions. Three, inclusion of variables derived from the mean-variance expected utility function representing risk factors may help correct {{the weakness of the}} price relationship model in revealing the causes of observing or failure to observe the law of one price.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with a <b>dynamic</b> <b>trading</b> strategy, which involves multiple synthetic spreads each of which involves long positions in a basket of underlying securities and short positions in another basket. We assume that the spreads can be modeled as mean-reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>trading</b> strategy is implemented as the solution to a stochastic optimal control problem that dynamically allocates capital over the spreads and a risk-free asset over a finite horizon to maximize a general constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) or constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) utility function of the terminal wealth. We show that this stochastic control problem is computationally tractable. Specifically, we show that the coefficient functions defining the optimal feedback law are the solutions {{of a system of}} ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that are the essence of the tractability of the stochastic optimal control problem. We illustrate the <b>dynamic</b> <b>trading</b> strategy with four pairs that consist of seven S&P 500 index stocks, which shows that the performance achieved by the <b>dynamic</b> spread <b>trading</b> strategy is significant and robust to realistic transaction costs. Key words: convergence <b>trading,</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>trading,</b> mean reversion, pairs trading, statistical arbitrage, stochastic optimal control. ...|$|R
40|$|We analyze how beauty {{contests}} due to <b>dynamic</b> <b>trading</b> in {{the presence}} of heterogeneous beliefs on public information can result in bubbles in stocks and options. We show that the effects of additional trading sessions on the stock price can be decomposed into two effects, the expectation effect and the risk premium effect. The first effect is caused by the differences about the mean of the public information among investors. When investors optimistic (pessimistic) about the public information have higher precision, the stock price will be higher (lower). The second effect is due to the disagreement about the covariance of the public information and the stock, which results in a reduction of risk premium, due to mutual insurance among investors provided by <b>dynamic</b> <b>trading.</b> The risk reduction effect causes the stock price to increase with the number trading sessions when investors agree on the expectation of the public signals. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>trading</b> also have two effects on options prices. The first effect is that the implied volatility in stock option prices will always decrease, which reduces option prices. The second effect is that as the stock price will change, this will in turn affect options prices. Hence, option prices can be higher or lower depending on the trade off between the two effects. Due to the reduction of risk, <b>dynamic</b> <b>trading</b> results in higher market liquidity. In the special case that investors disagree about the mean of the public information but agree on the covariance between the public signals and the stock payoff, the stock and option prices are not affected. We extend our results to heterogeneous priors on stock payoffs, <b>dynamic</b> <b>trading</b> without options and multiple stocks. 1...|$|R

In particular, <b>dynamic</b> <b>trading</b> strategies based on a mean-variance investor framework produce somewhat different results compared with those based on technical <b>trading</b> rules. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>trading</b> strategies suggest that all commodities are profitable and profits are dependent on structural breaks.

40|$|The {{hedge fund}} {{replication}} {{refers to the}} process of replicating, or cloning, the returns of hedge funds through a statistical model or algorithmic trading strategy. There are three approaches that are employed for hedge fund replication. The first method, factor replication, is a top-down approach, which tries to estimate asset exposures of hedge funds with various statistical methods. The second is a bottom-up approach, which is referred here to as rule-based replication. The article aims to isolate broad and fundamental characteristics of hedge fund strategies and implement these with automated trading algorithms. The third approach aims to replicate desirable distributional properties of hedge fund returns with <b>dynamic</b> <b>trading</b> techniques. The underlying assumption of factor replication method is that major parts of hedge fund returns can be captured by a set of common risk factors. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>trading</b> approach aims to match the distributional properties such as mean, volatility, and correlation of hedge fund return time-series relative to a portfolio of common assets. The return time-series of hedge funds are not expected to be replicated on a monthly basis. The implementation of <b>dynamic</b> <b>trading</b> involves three steps. Firstly, the investor's portfolio is used to functionally define desirable dependence structures relative to hedge fund returns. The second step is to derive the payoff function, where the reserve asset is the dependent variable, which will give the dependence structure relative to the investor's portfolio. The final and third step is to derive the <b>dynamic</b> <b>trading</b> strategy, which replicates the payoff function. SCOPUS: ch. binfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The central {{premise of}} the Black and Scholes (1973) and Merton (1973) option pricing theory is that there exists a {{self-financing}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>trading</b> policy of the stock and risk free accounts that renders the market dynamically complete. This requires that the market be complete and perfect. In this essay, we are concerned with cases in which <b>dynamic</b> <b>trading</b> breaks down either because the market is incomplete or because it is imperfect due {{to the presence of}} trading costs, or both. Market incompleteness renders the risk-neutral probability measure non unique and allows us to determine the option price only within a range. Recognition of trading costs requires a refinement in the definition and usage of the concept of a risk-neutral probability measure. Under these market conditions, a replicating <b>dynamic</b> <b>trading</b> policy does not exist. Nevertheless, we are able to impose restrictions on the pricing kernel and derive testable restrictions on the prices of options. We illustrate the theory in a series of market setups, beginning with the single period model, the two-period model and, finally, the general multiperiod model, with or without transaction costs. We also review related empirical results that document widespread violations of thes...|$|R
40|$|This study {{proposes a}} new {{alternative}} option pricing model that includes two independent jump diffusions. Unlike the existing single-jump model, a two-jump {{model can be}} constructed using theory that simultaneously allows for diversifiable as well as systematic jump risk. We compare three option pricing models: a two-jump, a single-jump and a no jump stochastic volatility model, respectively. We find that, as a whole, jump models perform better than no-jump model in terms of pricing error, hedging performance and <b>dynamic</b> <b>trading</b> profits. However, within the jump models, the two-jump model and single-jump model vary in their relative performance depending on the test criteria. Our findings support the inclusion of jump diffusion in option pricing {{and in some cases}} the distinction between systematic and diversifiable jump plays a role in pricing, hedging and <b>dynamic</b> <b>trading</b> with options. ...|$|R
