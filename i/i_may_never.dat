500|$|At about 2:00p.m., Charles put {{his head}} on the block after saying a prayer and signalled the executioner when he was ready by {{stretching}} out his hands; he was then beheaded with one clean stroke. According to observer Philip Henry, a moan [...] "as I never heard before and desire <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>never</b> hear again" [...] rose from the assembled crowd, some of whom then dipped their handkerchiefs in the king's blood as a memento.|$|E
500|$|The attempt failed; Little Juniata [...] faced {{extreme weather}} conditions, {{and was forced}} to retreat a few miles from Cape York. [...] De Long {{returned}} to Juniata [...] in mid-August, having found no trace of the Polaris [...] crew (who had meanwhile been rescued by the Scottish whaler Ravenscraig), but the experience had profoundly affected his outlook. Having earlier described the Greenland coast {{in a letter to his}} wife Emma as [...] "a dreary land of desolation... I hope <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>never</b> find myself cast away in such a perfectly God-forsaken place", he returned home captivated by the Arctic. Emma later wrote: [...] "The polar virus [...] was in his blood and would not let him rest".|$|E
500|$|Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times {{wrote that}} [...] "Mars Attacks! is all 1990s cynicism and disbelief, mocking the {{conventions}} that Independence Day takes seriously. This all sounds clever enough but in truth, Mars Attacks! {{is not as}} much fun as it should be. Few of its numerous actors make a lasting impression and Burton's heart and soul is not in the humor". Desson Thomson from The Washington Post said [...] "Mars Attacks! evokes plenty of sci-fi classics, from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) to Dr. Strangelove (1964), but it doesn't do much beyond that superficial exercise. With the exception of Burton's jolting sight gags (<b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>never</b> recover from the vision of Sarah Jessica Parker's head grafted on to the body of a chihuahua), the comedy is half-developed, pedestrian material. And the climactic battle between Earthlings and Martians is dull and overextended." ...|$|E

500|$|After again {{considering}} a candidacy for the 1988 presidential election, influenced by his personal difficulties and family concerns, and content with {{remaining in the}} Senate, in December 1985 Kennedy publicly cut short any talk that he might run. [...] He added: [...] "I know this decision means <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>never</b> be president. But {{the pursuit of the}} presidency is not my life. Public service is." [...] Kennedy used his legislative skills to achieve passage of the COBRA Act, which extended employer-based health benefits after leaving a job. Following the 1986 congressional elections, the Democrats regained control of the Senate and Kennedy became chair of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee. [...] By now Kennedy had become what colleague Joe Biden termed [...] "the best strategist in the Senate," [...] who always knew when best to move legislation. Kennedy continued his close working relationship with ranking Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, and they were close allies on many health-related measures.|$|E
500|$|One of the family's keenest {{customers}} was Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas James Birch, later Bosvile, {{a wealthy}} collector from Lincolnshire, who bought several specimens from them. In 1820 Birch became {{disturbed by the}} family's poverty. Having made no major discoveries for a year, {{they were at the}} point of having to sell their furniture to pay the rent. So he decided to auction the fossils he had purchased from them on their behalf. He wrote to the palaeontologist Gideon Mantell on 5 March that year to say that the sale was [...] "for the benefit of the poor woman and her son and daughter at Lyme, who have in truth found almost all the fine things which have been submitted to scientific investigation ... <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>never</b> again possess what I am about to part with, yet in doing it I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that the money will be well applied." [...] The auction was held at Bullocks in London on 15 May 1820, and raised £400 (worth the equivalent of over £26,000 in 2010). How much of that was given to the Annings is not known, but it seems to have placed the family on a steadier financial footing, and with buyers arriving from Paris and Vienna, the three-day event raised the family's profile within the geological community.|$|E

At one point his horse dropped from under him and, assuming {{that it had been}} killed, Hancock proceeded on foot. The horse later jumped to its feet, having been temporarily paralyzed by a glancing blow to the spine, and Hancock remounted. He shouted, [...] "We can beat them yet. Don't leave me, for God's sake!"

2500|$|Maj. Gen. Cadmus M. Wilcox's {{division}} assaulted the Union {{position at}} about 2 p.m. on August 25. Despite launching two attacks, Wilcox was driven back by Miles's division, which was manning {{the northern part}} of the earthworks. To the south, Gibbon's division was blocking the advance of Hampton's cavalry, which had swept around the Union line. Confederate reinforcements from Heth's and Mahone's divisions arrived while the Confederate artillery softened up the Union position. The final attack began around 5:30p.m. against Miles's position and it broke through the northwest corner of the Union fortifications. Hancock desperately galloped from one threatened point to the next, attempting to rally his men. As he witnessed the men of his once proud corps reluctant to retake their positions from the enemy, he remarked to a colonel, [...] "I do not care to die, but I pray God <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>never</b> leave this field." [...] By this time, Hampton's cavalry was making progress against Gibbon's infantry to the south, launching a surprise dismounted attack that caused many of Gibbon's men to flee or surrender. This allowed Hampton to flank Miles. Hancock ordered a counterattack, which provided time to allow for an orderly Union withdrawal to Petersburg after dark.|$|E
