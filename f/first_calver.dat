40|$|Lifetime {{performance}} was analysed in 6 981 Black and White cows with different proportion of Holstein Friesian inheritance from the active {{population in the}} Kujawsko- Pomorskie province according to first lactation yield. It was shown that {{from the viewpoint of}} lifetime efficiency, the optimum milk yield of <b>first</b> <b>calvers</b> depends on the milk yield level of the herd. In herds with ≤ 5 000 kg milk production, the best efficiency was shown by the cows that produced 6 001 – 7 000 kg milk as <b>first</b> <b>calvers.</b> A decrease in lifetime milk yield, reduced life span and length of productive life, and lower fertility should be taken into account for more efficient <b>first</b> <b>calvers.</b> In herds with 5 000 – 6 500 and > 6 500 kg milk production, lifetime milk yield and milk yield per day of (productive) life increased with increased first lactation milk yield, while fertility deteriorated...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} investigation, {{the effect of}} genetic and non-genetic groups on the {{incidence}} of reproductive problems has been studied. The effect of genetic group {{was found to be}} non-significant for all the reproduction problems in both <b>first</b> and all <b>calvers.</b> However, the effect of season of calving on repeat breeding and anoestrous was found to be significant and similar results was observed for period on pyometra in all calvers and but was not significant in <b>first</b> <b>calvers.</b> The cows suffered with anoestrous had non-significant effect on total milk yield and dry period while significant effect was found on 305 -days milk yield, lactation length, calving interval and service period.

30|$|There was {{a gradual}} {{increase}} in milk yield from parity 1 to 4 in Jersey cattle. This suggests that milk yield increases as parity proceeds because large cows produce more milk than small cows due to large body size and increased udder development {{that comes with}} repeated pregnancies as well as full development of tissues of the udder. Also, multiparous cows reach their peak earlier in the lactation than first parity cows and consume more feed, eat larger meals and drink more water therefore their persistency will be longer {{than that of the}} <b>first</b> <b>calvers</b> leading to less milk yield produced by <b>first</b> <b>calvers.</b> The milk yield was also lower in early parities because the feed that was provided to the heifers was also channeled to their growth as they were still growing. As the parities proceeded, milk yield increased because the feed requirements for growth were declining (Keown and Everett 1986).|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of Montbeliarde sires and sires with C 50 M genotype on the population of Czech Spotted cattle. The results were to contribute to the process of improvement of Czech Spotted cattle by the use of Montbeliarde cattle in breeding. This aim was followed in the two parts of the study. The first part evaluated the effect of some parameters on growth of heifers and milk production of <b>first</b> <b>calvers</b> in a selected herd; the evaluation was based on the comparison of several groups of animals with different proportion of Montbeliarde genotype, sired by the same sires.

The housing system significantly affected cow fertility, which also depended, both in the first reproductive cycle and over the cows‘ lifetime, on milk production level after the first calving.

40|$|Data on 2704 lactations of 993 Nili-Ravi buffaloes were {{analyzed}} {{to investigate the}} extent and behavior of short and complete lactations. Lactation milk yield up to 44 weeks was used and lactations with less. than eight weeks of duration were excluded. Fifty nine percent of the lactation records were shorter than 44 weeks. When minimum lactation length was required to be 26 weeks, 11 % of lactations did not meet this criterion. Among 2107 lactations of< 308 days duration, reasons of drying were known for 534 lactations (25 %). Out of these 31 % had mastitis, 16 % were shorter because buffaloes had been auctioned {{while she was in}} milk, 13 % had bad temperament. while the other 40 % were short because of reproductive problems and other reasons such as death of calf, old age, disease etc. Lactation curves were different for first and later parities with lactations of different duration.

40|$|Longevity (lifespan, {{length of}} {{productive}} life, number of calvings) was analysed in 25 231 cows that first calved in 1988 and 2000 in the Pomerania and Kujawy regions in Poland. GLM {{procedures of the}} SAS package {{were used in the}} statistical calculations. Longevity of cows that first calved in 2000 was found to improve in relation to that of cows that were first milked in 1988. The lifespan and length of productive life increased the most (by about 1 year) in herds of up to 20 cows, in herds with the lowest production level (by about 0. 85 years), in herds of cows that first calved before 24 months of age up (by about 1 year) and in herds of cows that yielded 4 000 – 7 000 kg milk as <b>first</b> <b>calvers</b> (by about 0. 5 years).

40|$|A {{computerized}} {{program was}} written to collect, evaluate and compare reproductive performance data of 2004 beef (Belgian Blue breed) and 1649 dairy (Friesian Holstein and German Red) cattle in 35 Belgian herds (6 suckler beef herds, 9 milked beef herds and 20 dairy herds). Reproduction {{data were collected}} at monthly herd health visits. No difference in age at first calving was observed. Significant differences were observed among the 3 kinds of herds, and the best results were obtained in dairy herds for the calving interval, interval from calving to the first estrus, interval from calving to the first service and average number of days open. Concerning these parameters, <b>first</b> <b>calvers</b> had lower results than multiparous cows, mainly in suckler and milked beef herds. Significant differences were noted {{in the number of}} services per pregnancy. Heifers that had never calved presented the highest fertility. Primiparous beef cows had higher fertility than pluriparous cows. In dairy herds, pluriparous cows had higher fertility than primiparous cows. Estrus detection was better in milked beef herds than in suckled beef and dairy herds. Suckled beef herds had the lowest incidence of metritis and ovarian cysts of the three types of herds. Rates of abortion, overall culling and retained fetal membranes were similar in all the herds. The percentage of animals removed for infertility was highest in milked beef herds and lowest in dairy herds.

40|$|Outbreaks of bovine ephemeral fever (BEF) {{occurred}} in Israel in 1990, 1999, and 2004. The main patterns of BEF spread {{were similar in}} the 1990 and in 1999 epidemics, and the BEF virus was probably carried in vectors transported by air streams across the Rift Valley and the Red Sea. In the 2004 outbreak, {{the primary focus of}} the disease was the southern Mediterranean coastal plain and the disease agent was apparently brought by infected mosquitoes carried from their breeding site in the Nile Delta by the south-western winds. The disease broke out under optimal ecological conditions, among a vulnerable cattle population and spread rapidly; it showed essentially a spring-summer herd incidence and terminated soon after the night average ambient temperature fell below 16 ∘C in late autumn. The herd incidence of the disease reached 78. 4 %, 97. 7 %, and 100 % in 1990, 1999, and 2004, respectively. The highest herd incidence, morbidity, and case fatality rates were noted in dairy cattle herds in the Jordan Valley, with morbidity of 20 %, 38. 6 %, and 22. 2 %, and case fatality rate among affected animals of 2 %, 8. 6 %, and 5. 4 % in 1990, 1999, and 2004, respectively. The average sero-positivity to BEF in 1999 was 39. 5 %, which matched the morbidity rate. Comparison among the various age groups showed that the lowest morbidity rates were observed in the youngest age group, that is, heifers up to 1 year, with 3. 2 %, 3. 6 %, and 4. 2 % in 1990, 1999, and 2004, respectively.

40|$|Spring calving cows {{were used}} in the years 1997 to 2003 in the {{development}} of planned low and high input systems of suckler beef production. The main objective {{of the study was to}} compare a semiintensive Grange (standard) : system of suckler beef production with a more extensive REPS (Rural Environment Protection Scheme) compatible system. In the standard system the stocking rate was 0. 80 ha per cow unit (cow plus heifer and steer progeny to slaughter at 20 and 23 / 24 months of age, respectively, plus replacements or its equivalent), a nitrogenous fertiliser application rate of 210 kg per ha and two silage harvests each year amounting to the equivalent of 87 % of the total area harvested. The REPS system involved a 25 % lower stocking rate, an annual nitrogen fertiliser application rate of 90 to 100 kg per ha and one silage harvest (portion in late May to provide good silage for the progeny and the remainder in June to provide lower quality silage for cows) amounting to 58 % of the total area harvested. Between 1997 and 2000 the cow herd were Limousin x Friesians (LF) and Simmental x (Limousin x Friesians) (SLF). A herd of <b>first</b> <b>calvers</b> were introduced in 2001 and 2002 which in addition to LF and SLF included Limousin x (Limousin x Friesians), purebred Limousin and purebred Charolais. Charolais (or Simmental) sires were used on mature cows. Replacement heifers were bred to calve at 2 years of age using an easy calving Limousin bull. Concentrate inputs per animal were the same in the two systems. The main findings of the study were: • The mean nitrogenous application rates were 210 and 98 kg per ha in the standard and REPS systems, respectively. • Mean dry matter digestibility of the first-cut silages harvested early (May 19 to May 29), late (June 5 to June 13) and the second cut silage in the standard system (harvested in July/early August) were 716, 690 and 674 g/kg, respectively. • When averaged throughout two grazing seasons there was no difference between the standard and REPS systems in pregrazing or post-grazing sward heights. When examined over one grazing season the only major difference between the grazing areas was that the pasture crude protein content was higher in the standard system in both the pre-grazed (205 and 159 g/kg) and post-grazed (172 v 141 g/kg) swards. Cow liveweight and body condition score gains at pasture and calf gains from birth to weaning were the same for both systems. Carcass weights of the progeny were the same for the standard and REPS systems. End of Project Repor...|$|R
40|$|Shiga-Toxin {{producing}} Escherichia coli (STEC) are {{an emerging}} human health issue with special {{regard to their}} low infectious dose combined with serious sequelae of disease especially in children. Cattle are often infected, but without clinical signs of disease; hence, cattle derived foods could be contaminated. Different factors {{like the kind of}} husbandry, the diet and the herd management of cattle were identified as risk for shedding of STEC. However, the individual characteristics of the single animal seem to have a major impact. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the faecal excretion of STEC by dairy cattle over the course of one year. The design of the study was longitudinal to follow selected dairy cows over a period of twelve months to reveal their shedding patterns. Furthermore, the data was analyzed at herd level to detect and evaluate different risk factors. Additional information about herd management, nutritional and health status were available as well as data about the amount and contents of milk, the number of passed lactations and the days in milk. The data was statistically analyzed using the procedure ‘logistic’ in ‘SAS®’. On six dairy farms in Northern Germany, 1, 646 faecal samples from 140 cows in different lactation numbers were examined once per month. Following cultural isolation, stx-positive cows were identified by PCR. STEC of these cows were isolated by colony-hybridization and characterized by PCR. Furthermore, selected STEC-isolates were serotyped. In 24. 7 % (407) of all samples, stx were detected by the screening-PCR. Within the herds, prevalence varied between 11. 1 % and 32. 3 %. Most of the 140 investigated animals excreted stx at least once (87. 1 % 122 cows. Cows with at least four consecutive positive samplings (10. 0 %, 14 cows) were classified as continuously shedding cows. Isolated Shiga-toxin producing E. coli from these cows were selected (n= 61). They belonged to 24 Sorbitol-fermenting non-O 157 :H 7 -STEC-serovares, some of them were detected from single cows on two to five consecutive samplingl. In this study, 1, 105 STEC were isolated. Dominating combinations of virulence genes were stx 2 and EHEC-hlyA (434 isolates, 39. 3 %), and stx 1, stx 2 and EHEC-hlyA (311 isolates, 28. 1 %). Significant risk factors for the shedding of STEC were the month of sampling (Odds Ratio (OR) summer vs. spring = 1. 64, OR autumn vs. spring = 2. 35, OR winter vs. spring = 1. 60), the number of lactations (OR <b>first</b> <b>calvers</b> vs. > 3 completed lactations = 1. 74) and days in lactation (OR 51. - 100. d vs. 1. - 50. d = 1. 73, OR 101. - 150. d vs. 1. - 50. d = 1. 93, OR > 350. d vs. 1. - 50. d = 2. 06, ORdry cow vs. 1. - 50. d = 1. 67, the nutritional condition (OR BCS > 3. 5 vs. 100, 000 = 1. 57) and the content of protein in milk (OR 3. 00 - 3. 80 % vs. 3. 80 % vs. < 3. 00 % = 2. 30). Most notably, the presence of STEC Super-shedding cows in the herd (OR Super-Shedder present vs. no Super-Shedder = 2. 63) was a significant risk factor. This study confirms the importance of continuously shedding cows as a major source of STEC. These cows maintain the infectious cycle of STEC in the herd; therefore, interventions on individual animal might serve as the base for an effective pathogen control...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} the investigation of behaviours which might influence the number and/or weight of calf weaned from single-suckled Angus cows. The behaviour patterns involved were those relevant to parturition, the cow-calf bond and nursing. The effect of such factors as maternal experience, sex, and age of calf and the presence of non-lactating cows were also investigated. In addition, the liveweight of the calves was taken at birth and thereafter at regular intervals throughout the course of the study. Observations began on average 31 d (range 4 to 65 d) pre-partum and continued until 3 weeks post-weaning, c. 33 weeks after the start of the investigation and involved > 900 h of field observations. Eighteen pregnancy-tested Angus cows were involved of which 14 calved. Of these, 5 primiparous and 6 multiparous reared their own calf. Two calves, 1 born from a primigravid and the other born from a multigravid cow, appeared to die as the result of abnormal maternal behaviour. These maternal behaviours resulted in either physical injury to the neonate and/or refusal by the cow to allow the calf to nurse. The latter behaviour was followed by hypothermia in the calf, although adverse weather conditions probably accentuated this heat loss. Two primigravid cows rejected their calves and had to be isolated for up to 5 d and restrained before the cow would accept the calf's presence and nursing activities. A method of predicting the order and time of calving for each cow was devised. Determination of the calving order was possible in 12 of the 14 cows prior to the birth of the first calf. The use of 24 physical signs allowed prediction of calving time to within 48 h in all 14 cows. Changes in such behaviours as posture and social activity were associated with calving within the following 3 to 4 h in all except 1 cow. This animal was found to exhibit dystocia, i. e., an extended parturition of > 19 h. On average the physical signs were observed before the behaviours and more cows were recorded for the presence of physical signs than for behavioural signs. However, there was wide variation in the number of signs recorded and the time they were first observed for each of the cows. No single sign could be effectively used for prediction of either calving order or the time of calving, i. e., delivery of the calf. There was a highly significant difference between the primigravid and multigravid cows in their calving time. The heifers showed a decided tendency to calve during daylight whilst equal numbers of the older cows calved during daylight as during darkness. The area chosen for calving {{did not appear to be}} random. A very highly significant number of cows calved in the same area which provided the parturient cow with visual isolation up to 20 m. The importance of such isolation and subsequent localization to a specific area on the early occurrence of nursing and primary socialization was demonstrated. Determination of onset and termination of first-stage labour on the basis of either physical or behavioural criteria was only an approximation. Overall, it was more difficult to determine the duration of the various stages of parturition using behaviours than when using physical signs, although there was a tendency for the different behavioural parameters to occur more frequently and/or at greater intensity at specific times during the process. The effect of experience on maternal behaviour was demonstrated on a number of occasions. For example, with one exception all the primiparous cows showed a significantly shorter duration of maternal grooming of the neonate than did the multiparous cows. With the exception of 1 multiparous cow, abnormal maternal behaviour was observed only from the primipara. Five of these 6 cows showed some form of agonism on first seeing the neonate. In all except 1 cow this ended several minutes after the cow had investigated the calf. Other abnormal behaviours such as orientation toward the calf during its teat-seeking activities were recorded only amongst the <b>first</b> <b>calvers</b> and on all occasions resulted in a longer time taken prior to location of the teat by the calf. On termination of the dam-offspring association at weaning the response from cows and calves was apparent in changes in their behaviour. During the following 7 d the calves showed a very high level of unity in their activities and spatial distribution. As well the form of social interaction changed and became predominantly agonistic. This resulted in rapid establishment of a social rank which appeared to decrease further agonisra and instead increased such epimeletic behaviour as grooming. Despite these changes in behaviour the liveweight of the calves did not significantly change from 11 d pre-weaning until termination of the study 21 d later. The cows reacted to weaning by increased aggregation, vocalization and walking for up to 9 d post-weaning. These changes were reflected in an apparent decrease in grazing and rumination duration. Fence damage and localized areas of severe pugging was also recorded. Nursing was investigated for the form and degree of occurrence of both maternal and filial behaviours, including cross- and non-nutritional nursing, as well as the pattern of sucking, i. e., sucking frequency, duration and time spent nursing, and the diurnal and circadian rhythms...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} suckler cows in Sweden has {{increased}} from 60 000 in the mideighties to 165 000 1995. By tradition {{the majority of the}} suckler cows are tied up in former milking cow barns during the winter season. These barns are insulated and ventilated, not very well maintained and very labour consuming. The interest and need for development of simple, rational and cheap systems of production systems for suckler cow has increased. This study comprises both a literature review and a field study. The literature review concerns the economy in suckler cow production as well as the origin of the cattle, ethology and their behaviour. It emphasizes the role of natural behaviour, because suckler cow production in more simple production systems and housing, to be successful, has {{to take advantage of the}} natural behaviour patterns in cattle at a great degree. The last and main part of the literature review concerns climate and ambient environment and the effect on cattle heat balance, possibilities for adjustment to cold and need for extra energy when the animals are exposed to low outside temperatures as well as wind and snow or rain. The literature review concludes that housing cattle outside or in simple sheds, results in a slightly higher feed consumption because of decreased digestibility of feed and because of demand of extra feed to maintain heat balance during cold periods. The literature review also shows that the suckler cow is well adjusted to stay outside or in simple sheds during the winter in Sweden if provided with sufficient feed. The field study includes material from visits at 50 suckler cow herds with different types of housing including insulated buildings with tied up cattle, different types of loose house systems, (cubicles, deep litter straw bedding etc) and even ranch systems without buildings. Geographically the herds are sited from Stockholm region to the southernmost province, Skåne. The herd size varied from 15 to 1000 suckler cows. Most of the herds had between 30 and 60 dams. The critical period in suckler cow production is the cold season combined with calving Then the demand on the thermal environment and intensity of labour is at its maximum. The question is how the producer can coop with these critical situations in an optimum way considering the animal and human wellfare. In the field study different aspects of this, such as technical, labour and animal environment, investment and feed costs, health and productivity where looked at. The results of the field study shows that suckler cow production under Swedish climatic and soil conditions can, maintained in low cost buildings with little input of labour and economic resources, still be far better than production in the traditional way in insulated houses and with tied up cows. In the field study, the following conclusions have been drawn: - Dividing the dams into groups, are at all forms of loose house systems important so that younger and weaker individuals do not loose weight and condition. The most suitable groups are pregnant heifers in one group, <b>first</b> time <b>calvers</b> and cows in bad condition in one group and older cows in good condition in one group. - Date of calving is not a factor that excludes simple non- insulated barns. Early calving is performed with good result except when calving outside especially when there is wet snow, which can cause loss of new-born calves. - Calving difficulties are much less in loose house systems compared to tied up systems. - There should be sufficient of calving boxes, preferably one box per 8 - 10 heifers and one per 15 - 20 cows. In tied up system the need for calving boxes are even bigger. - Calf cribs are well used by the calves. It should be placed in such a way that it provides the calves with a sheltered resting place and the space must be sufficient, at least 0, 6 m 2 per calf or bigger, It should also be placed near the cows, be easy to reach for the calves and free from draught. - Calf health is better in loose house systems where there are less animals per m 2 and the air volume per beast is greater than in tied up systems. - The working hours are more in a tied up system during the wintertime, 15 - 20 hours per cow compared to 8 - 14 hours per cow in a loose house system. - The need for checking and looking alter the cows and calves during the calving period is much greater in a tied up system than it is in a loose house system, but there is a greater demand in the stockman’s ability to take notice in his or her cattle in a loose house system. - When using existing buildings such as barns, one must be aware of the needs of reinforcement, particularly in the walls from animals and bedding. - When using straw bedding, the experience often is that the need of straw is very large and the work with the straw takes a great deal of time. There are great differences in the amount of straw that is needed depending on how many animals per m 2 there are, type of feed stuff, the quality of the straw and if there is an exercise yard connected to the bam. - Straw should, if possible, be kept under roof. It decreases the need of straw and makes it easier to use. The conclusion of this study throughout both literature and field studies, is that there are good possibilities in Sweden, to develop the more simple forms of housing with maintained or more likely enhanced health and well-being in the suckler cows and their calves, To be able to take in use more simple forms of housing for the suckler cows and by this lowering the costs, means greater possibilities for the suckler cow production to survive in the long run. Today there is no margin in the suckler cow production for any expensive investments...|$|R
