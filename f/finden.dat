5|$|The {{books were}} {{relatively}} expensive to print, {{because of the}} Corbould and <b>Finden</b> illustrations, the images for the scientific volumes, {{and the use of}} Spottiswoode's printing house. In order to cut costs, the publishers decided to use small print and narrow margins. An estimated 4,000 copies of the first edition of the early volumes were printed, but the print run would probably have fallen to 2,500 since the sales did not pick up after 1835. As {{it became clear that the}} series was not going to take off, fewer review copies were sent out and advertisements became smaller. Lardner's interest in the project may also have waned, as he paid less attention to its business dealings. However, some volumes of the Cabinet Cyclopaedia remained in print until 1890.|$|E
500|$|Koditschek {{says that}} Tod [...] "developed an {{interest}} in triangulating local culture, politics and history alongside his maps", and Metcalf believes that Tod [...] "ordered [...] past {{as well as their}} present" [...] while working in India. During his time in Rajputana, Tod was able to collect materials for his Annals and Antiquities of Rajas'han, which detailed the contemporary geography and history of Rajputana and Central India along with the history of the Rajput clans who ruled most of the area at that time. Described by historian Crispin Bates as [...] "a romantic historical and anecdotal account" [...] and by David Arnold, another historian, as a [...] "travel narrative" [...] by [...] "one of India's most influential Romantic writers", the work was published in two volumes, in 1829 and 1832, and included illustrations and engravings by notable artists such as the Storers, Louis Haghe and either Edward or William <b>Finden.</b> He had to finance publication himself: sales of works on history had been moribund for some time and his name was not particularly familiar either at home or abroad. Original copies are now scarce, but they have been reprinted in many editions. The version published in 1920, which was edited by the orientalist and folklorist William Crooke, is significantly editorialised.|$|E

2500|$|German, {{while being}} {{predominantly}} head-initial, is less conclusively so {{than in the}} case of English. German also features certain head-final structures. For example, in a nonfinite verb phrase the verb is final. In a finite verb phrase (or tense/aspect phrase) the verb (tense/aspect) is initial, although it may move to final position in a subordinate clause. In the following example, the verb phrase es <b>finden</b> is head-final, whereas the tense phrase werde es <b>finden</b> (headed by the auxiliary verb werde indicating future tense) is head-initial.|$|E
