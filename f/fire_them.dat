5|$|Each gun rested {{within an}} armored turret, {{but only the}} top of the turret {{protruded}} above the main deck. The turret extended either four decks (Turrets 1 and 3) or five decks (Turret 2) down. The lower spaces contained the equipment required to rotate the turret and to elevate the guns attached to each turret. At the bottom of the turret were rooms which were used for handling the projectiles and storing the powder bags used to <b>fire</b> <b>them.</b> All of the compartments within the turrets were separated by flameproof bulkheads to prevent any flame or lethal gas from spreading throughout the turret. Each turret required a crew of 7794 men to operate. The turrets were not actually attached to the ship, but sat on rollers, which meant that if the ship were to capsize the turrets would fall out. Each turret cost US $1.4 million, but this number did not include the cost of the guns themselves.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} compare {{individual}} striations, examiners must obtain a known sample using the seized weapon. For slower-traveling bullets, such as pistols or revolvers, known bullet exemplars {{are created by}} firing the weapon into a water tank. The spent bullet can be recovered, intact, as the water slows down the bullet before it can reach the tank walls, allowing {{for it to be}} recovered. For faster traveling bullets, such as those fired from high-powered rifles and military style weapons, water tanks cannot be used as the tank will not provide enough stopping power for the projectiles. To examine these weapons, investigators must <b>fire</b> <b>them</b> at a target at a controlled range with enough backing to stop the bullet and collect the spent round after it has been fired.|$|E

Tom (Aziz Ansari) suggests they hire Entertainment 720 for the event, a production company recently started by his friend Jean-Ralphio (Ben Schwartz). Jean-Ralphio encourages Tom to come work with him on the company, but Tom is reluctant to leave his city hall job. Meanwhile, the extremely health-conscious Chris (Rob Lowe) finds out he has tendonitis, and takes the news so seriously that he questions his own mortality. Leslie and Ben (Adam Scott) continue their romance despite a no-dating policy at city hall, but they have difficulty keeping it a secret.

5|$|The {{economic}} policies of Modi's government focused on privatisation and liberalisation of the economy, {{based on a}} neoliberal framework. Modi liberalised India's foreign direct investment policies, allowing more foreign investment in several industries, including in defence and the railways. Other reforms included removing many of the country's labour laws, {{to make it harder}} for workers to form unions and easier for employers to hire and <b>fire</b> <b>them.</b> These reforms met with support from institutions such as the World Bank, but opposition from scholars within the country. The labour laws also drew strong opposition from unions: on 2 September 2015, eleven of the country's largest unions went on strike, including one affiliated with the BJP. The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, a constituent of the Sangh Parivar, stated that the reforms would hurt labourers by making it easier for corporations to exploit them. In his first budget, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley promised to gradually reduce the budgetary deficit from 4.1 percent to 3 percent over two years, and to divest from shares in public banks. Over Modi's first year in office, the Indian GDP grew at a rate of 7.5 percent, making it the world's fastest-growing large economy.|$|E

This was basis a revised formula introduced a year after he took office, which surprised a lot of economists. However, this rate of growth had fallen significantly to 6.1%, even by the revised metric, by his third year in office. This fall has been blamed on the exercise of demonetisation of currency.|$|E
500|$|Afterwards, Omega took a hiatus from NJPW to [...] "reassess [...] future". Upon {{his return}} on February 26, a new storyline {{involving}} tension between Omega and Cole was started, with The Young Bucks {{caught in the}} middle. On February 11, Frankie Kazarian joined Bullet Club, turning on longtime tag team partner Christopher Daniels at a taping of Ring of Honor Wrestling. On March 4, The Young Bucks lost the ROH World Tag Team Championship to The Hardys (Broken Matt and Brother Nero). On March 10 at ROH's 15th Anniversary Show, Kazarian turned on Adam Cole and Bullet Club, revealing his tenure was only a ruse to help Christopher Daniels become the new ROH World Champion. The following day, Cole, disappointed with The Young Bucks for not having his back, tried to <b>fire</b> <b>them</b> from Bullet Club, but the two responded by stating {{that he could not}} <b>fire</b> <b>them</b> as Omega, not Cole, was the leader of the stable. Despite the dissension among members of the Superkliq, Cole remained a member of Bullet Club. On April 1 at Supercard of Honor XI, The Young Bucks regained the ROH World Tag Team Championship from The Hardys in a ladder match. On May 12, during the third night of the NJPW and ROH co-produced War of the Worlds tour, Omega fired Cole from Bullet Club and gave his spot in the stable to ROH World Television Champion Marty Scurll. Two days later, on the final night of the tour, Scurll lost the ROH World Television Championship to Kushida, following a distraction from Cole.|$|E

500|$|Not all reviews were as positive, however. Erik Adams of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "C+" [...] and highly criticized the {{characterization}} of Michael. Largely, he felt that Michael's antics made him {{out to be a}} jerk because the series has not worked at showing that he truly [...] "isnâ€™t a complete asshole". Adams noted that Michael [...] "could truly force Darryl and his staff to work on Saturdays, and he truly could <b>fire</b> <b>them</b> for winning the basketball game. But that would be an outrageous abuse of legitimate power, which isnâ€™t funny." [...] Ultimately he argued that the basketball scenes went on for too long; he said the [...] "episodeâ€™s original cut ran too long to air, and itâ€™s obvious where the basketball scenes boxed out other threads of the episode".|$|E

Miller said that [...] "If any current laws or regulations are impeding the (VA)â€™s ability to swiftly hold employees accountable, VA leaders must work with Congress so those laws and regulations can be changed", and â€œVA appears to be giving failing executives an opportunity to quit, retire or find new jobs without consequence."

The Jantzen representatives reject the ad as overly risquÃ©, and Draper - exasperated by the clients' refusal to acknowledge a changing culture and the realities of their business - ends up throwing the men out of the meeting room.

Outraged by this, Liz tells Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) and Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) about what Lutz called her and wants to fire him. Frank reveals that Lutz's poor behavior is due to the passing of his grandmother. After it is pointed out that she has been a terrible boss to the staff, Liz begins acting nice, but this backfires when they take advantage of her. Angered by this, Liz confronts the writers about their actions, and tells Lutz she knows what he called her.

500|$|When Mulder and Scully were {{reassigned to}} the X-Files office, Kersh {{continued}} {{to climb the}} ladder, culminating in an assignment as Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. It was not long after his promotion that Mulder was abducted by aliens. At {{the beginning of the}} eighth season, Kersh assigned John Doggett (Robert Patrick) to run the manhunt for Mulder. When the manhunt failed, Doggett was assigned to the X-files with Scully, until Mulder was found in [...] "This Is Not Happening". When Mulder returned, Kersh refused to assign him to the X-Files, keeping Doggett in that position.

After Doggett saw Kersh in a late night meeting with two conspirators, Knowle Rohrer and Gene Crane, Doggett brought in Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) to help him investigate Kersh's involvement in Mulder's disappearance. The investigation turned up nothing. Although Doggett seemed convinced that Kersh was involved in the conspiracy, Kersh insisted that he was actually protecting Mulder.|$|E

500|$|Command posts were dug in {{and weapons}} pits and shell scrapes were commenced, yet many were not {{completed}} to any depth {{due to a}} lack of time, while a heavy rainfall started at 18:00 and soon filled the pits with water anyway.

Meanwhile, 90mm M67 recoilless rifles (RCLs) from the 1 RAR Anti-Tank Platoon armed with High Explosive Anti-tank (HEAT) and anti-personnel flechette ammunition were sited to support the forward machine-guns.
