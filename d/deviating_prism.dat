40|$|Purpose: At present, prism {{adaptation}} {{is probably}} the most promising rehabilitation procedure for hemi-neglect. However, randomised controlled trials are lacking and no data are available on the effectiveness of prism adaptation in the treatment of acute neglect. Methods: We followed sixteen neglect patients using a randomised controlled design in which six patients received four-day-in-a-row placebo treatment (CG) and ten patients received four-day-in-a row experimental treatment with 10 ° rightward <b>deviating</b> <b>prisms</b> (EG) during their stay on the stroke unit. We examined whether patients in the EG improved faster than the CG by administering three neglect tasks (Schenkenberg Line Bisection, Letter Cancellation, Gainotti Scene Copying) immediately before and after each treatment. Second, we examined whether patients in the EG demonstrated a better long-term outcome at one month post-treatment (Behavioural Inattention Test). Results: Patients in the EG improved faster on spatial tasks (line bisection, cancellation) than the CG but not on visuo-construction. Patients in the EG showed no differences with the CG in neglect outcome at one month post-treatment. Conclusions: Four consecutive prism sessions produced beneficial effects in patients with acute neglect. However, prism effects were either short-term, or placebo treatment with repeated pointing and/or repeated neglect testing was more helpful than we anticipated. Our results emphasize the importance of a placebo condition and a follow-up in rehabilitation studies...|$|R
40|$|Prismatic {{adaptation}} {{has been}} shown to induce a realignment of visuoproprioceptive representations and to involve parietocerebellar networks. We have investigated in humans how far other types of functions known to involve the parietal cortex are influenced by a brief exposure to prismatic adaptation. Normal subjects underwent an fMRI evaluation before and after a brief session of prismatic adaptation using rightward <b>deviating</b> <b>prisms</b> for one group or after an equivalent session using plain glasses for the other group. Activation patterns to three tasks were analyzed: (1) visual detection; (2) visuospatial short-term memory; and (3) verbal short-term memory. The prismatic adaptation-related changes were found bilaterally in the inferior parietal lobule when prisms, but not plain glasses, were used. This effect was driven by selective changes during the visual detection task: an increase in neural activity was induced on the left and a decrease on the right parietal side after prismatic adaptation. Comparison of activation patterns after prismatic adaptation on the visual detection task demonstrated a significant increase of the ipsilateral field representation in the left inferior parietal lobule and a significant decrease in the right inferior parietal lobule. In conclusion, a brief exposure to prismatic adaptation modulates differently left and right parietal activation during visual detection but not during short-term memory. Furthermore, the visuospatial representation within the inferior parietal lobule changes, with a decrease of the ipsilateral hemifield representation on the right and increase on the left side, suggesting thus a left hemispheric dominance...|$|R
40|$|Prismatic {{adaption}} (PA) {{has been}} proposed {{as a tool to}} induce neural plasticity and is used to help neglect rehabilitation. It leads to a recalibration of visuo-motor coordination during pointing as well as to after-effects on a number of sensorimotor and attention tasks, but whether these effects originate at a motor or attentional level remains a matter of debate. Our aim was to further characterise PA after-effects by using an approach that allows distinguishing between effects on attentional and motor processes. We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) in healthy human participants (9 females and 7 males) while performing a new double step, anticipatory attention/motor preparation paradigm before and after adaptation to rightward shifting prisms, with neutral lenses as a control. We then examined PA after-effects through changes in known oscillatory EEG signatures of spatial attention orienting and motor preparation in the alpha and beta frequency bands. Our results were twofold. First, we found PA to rightward shifting prisms to selectively affect EEG signatures of motor but not attentional processes. More specifically, PA modulated preparatory motor EEG activity over central electrodes in the right hemisphere, contralateral to the PA-induced, compensatory leftward shift in pointing movements. No effects were found on EEG signatures of spatial attention orienting over occipito-parietal sites. Second, we found the PA effect on preparatory motor EEG activity to dominate in the beta frequency band. We conclude that changes to intentional visuo-motor rather than attentional visuo-spatial processes underlie the PA after-effect of rightward <b>deviating</b> <b>prisms</b> in healthy participants...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose—To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} prism adaptation (PA) on spatial neglect signs. Methods—Ten patients (hemianopia in 6) and 8 control subjects were included. Tasks were reading single words, nonwords, and a text, bell cancellation, line bisection, and scene drawing, before and after adaptation, with either <b>deviating</b> or neutral <b>prisms.</b> Results—Errors were more frequent in patients but without any specific effect of PA. We found partial improvement at the late sessions, independent of prisms. Conclusions—We did not confirm the efficacy of PA on spatial neglect. (Stroke. 2006; 37 : 542 - 543.) Key Words: neglect rehabilitation stroke Spatial neglect (SN) is a main consequence of righthemisphere stroke. Prism adaptation (PA) to a rightward optical deviation could reduce SN manifestations and espe-cially improve performance in article and pencil tests 1, 2 and errors in reading texts, 1 single words, 2, 3 and nonwords. 3 However, the efficacy of PA has been discussed recently. 4, 5 We re-evaluated the efficacy of PA on reading and other clinical tests by comparing the effect of <b>deviating</b> and neutral <b>prisms</b> in the same patients...|$|R
40|$|Studies on visuomanual control {{emphasised}} {{the importance}} of extraretinal signals in distance coding, though enriching the workspace generally decreased perceptual distance underestimation as noticed otherwise. The present study investigated the integration of retinal-extraretinal inputs by analysing movements accuracy in a dark or textured workspace wearing optical <b>prisms</b> <b>deviating</b> vertically (± 10 °) visual information. The hand-to-target vector was always available. A non-structured workspace entailed an underestimation of target distance, which disappeared when appending texture information. Prisms influenced spatial performances in all conditions, though {{to a lesser extent}} with a textured workspace, which suggested a complex integration of retinal and extra-retinal distance information.

40|$|Trace of ray <b>deviated</b> by a <b>prism,</b> {{which is}} common in a TIR (total {{internal}} reflection) measurement system, is sometimes difficult to manage, especially if the prism is an equilateral right angle prism (ERAP). The point where the ray is reflected inside the right-angle prism is also changed as the angle of incident ray changed. In an ATR (attenuated total reflectance) measurement system, range of this point determines size of sample. Using JavaScript and HTML 5 model and visualization of ray tracing deviated by an ERAP is perform and reported in this work. Some data are obtained from this visualization and an empirical relations between angle of incident ray source θ_S, angle of ray detector hand θ_D, and angle of ray detector θ'_D are presented for radial position of ray source R_S, radial position of ray detector R_D, height of right-angle prism t, and refractive index of the prism n.

40|$|Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is an invalidating chronic {{condition}} subsequent to peripheral lesions. There is growing consensus for a central contribution to CRPS. However, {{the nature of}} this central body representation disorder is increasingly debated. Although it has been repeatedly argued that CRPS results in motor neglect of the affected side, visual egocentric reference frame was found to be deviated toward the pain, that is, neglect of the healthy side. Accordingly, prism adaptation has been successfully used to normalize this deviation. This study aimed at clarifying whether 7 CRPS patients exhibited neglect as well as exploring the pathophysiological mechanisms of this manifestation and of the therapeutic effects of prism adaptation. Pain and quality of life, egocentric reference frames (visual and proprioceptive straight-ahead), and neglect tests (line bisection, kinematic analyses of motor neglect and motor extinction) were repeatedly assessed prior to, during, and following a one-week intense prism adaptation intervention. First, our results provide no support for visual and motor neglect in CRPS. Second, reference frames for body representations were not systematically <b>deviated.</b> Third, intensive <b>prism</b> adaptation intervention durably ameliorated pain and quality of life. As for spatial neglect, understanding the therapeutic effects of prism adaptation deserves further investigations...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLeft-hemiparetic {{patients}} show predominant postural imbalance {{as compared}} to right-hemiparetic patients. The right hemisphere is crucial for generating internal maps used for perceptual and premotor processing of spatial information. Predominant postural imbalance with right-brain damage could thus result from a distortion of an internal postural map. Well-known manifestations of distorted internal maps due to right-hemisphere lesions, such as hemineglect, may show improvement following prism adaptation shifting the visual field to the right. We therefore investigated the effect of prism adaptation on postural imbalance in left-hemiparetic patients. Three groups of five patients were either adapted to <b>prisms</b> <b>deviating</b> the visual field to the right or left or exposed to neutral prisms while performing reaching movements of the right arm. Postural imbalance was reduced only following prism adaptation to the right. Thus, brief adaptation (i. e., 3 min) to rightward-shifting prisms can dramatically improve postural imbalance. This result shows {{that the effect of}} exposure to prisms that horizontally shift the visual field to the right in a reaching task generalizes to the postural system, and it suggests an interaction between horizontal and vertical reference frames. This also supports the theory that predominant postural imbalance in patients with right-brain damage may be partly related to a distortion of an internal postural map...|$|R
40|$|Electron {{backscatter}} diffraction is used {{to characterize}} the transition interface between aragonite prisms and nacre in two species of freshwater molluscs, Anodonta anatina (Linnaeus, 1758) and Anodonta cygnea (L. 1758). In the duck mussel, Anodonta anatina, the shell thickness is comprised mainly of nacre with only a thin outer prismatic layer, whereas in the swan mussel, A. cygnea, the shell comprises a greater thickness of aragonite prisms relative to the nacreous layer. In A. anatina, the prism−nacre interface is flat and featureless. In A. cygnea, the nacre below {{the base of the}} prisms is characterized by distinct concave footholds. In both species, the c-axis of aragonite nanogranules comprising the prisms is parallel with the prism length. This crystallographic orientation, with the c-axis perpendicular to the shell exterior, occurs in the nacreous layer and thus is conserved throughout the shell thickness. In A. cygnea alternate prisms have a crystallographic orientation with the c-axis <b>deviating</b> from the <b>prism</b> long axis by approximately 20 deg. The initial nacreous layer adopts the crystallographic orientation of the preceding prisms and subsequent nacreous laminae are oriented in register with the bulk nacre. This is consistent with the hypothesis that nacre evolved through horizontal partitioning of prisms. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Slalom walking wearing {{distorting}} prisms {{has been}} used to study multitasking during adaptation to spatial disorientation. We address the hypothesis that slalom-prism walking could interfere specifically with concurrent spatial tasks. Methods: Subjects (16 men, 16 women) sat for 30 s then slalom walked through 5 aligned batons. This exercise was performed with normal vision and with <b>prisms</b> <b>deviating</b> gaze laterally by 15 °. Both conditions were done without any tasks, with a verbal task (matching the sex of male and female names uttered by male and female voices), and a spatial task (matching laterality of the words 'right' and `left' delivered to the right or left ear). Conditions were balanced with instructions to perform rapidly and accurately. Results: Time to walk the slalom was extended by the prisms from 16 s to 33 s, but unaffected by tasks. Slalom increased error rates on the spatial task by 8 % above baseline, but verbal task errors remained unchanged. Prisms did not affect task errors. The rates of processing cognitive task items were slowed by approximately 0. 5 s by slalom and by 1 s slalom walking with prisms. Prisms increased task reaction times by 340 ms during slalom. Contact with the poles occurred when multitasking, with men making three times more contacts than women. Conclusions: Slowing of all performance parameters is consistent with a `bottleneck' caused by task multiplexing. Competition for spatial processing resources and confusion because of similar features may cause interference between the lateralized spatial task and slalom...|$|R
40|$|The Sunda {{subduction}} margin, {{the location}} of recent magnitude 8 - 9 megathrust earthquakes, is characterized by major changes in prism and forearc morphology and structure along its 5000 ?km length. On the Sumatra-Andaman section, measurements of prism width and surface slope (?) indicate along-strike segments, including abrupt changes, of prism morphology: (1) a narrow and steep prism between Burma and the Andamans; (2) broad with an averaged gentle slope in the Andamans, Nicobars and North Sumatra; (3) steep and narrow in Central Sumatra; and (4) wider and less steep offshore South Sumatra, decreasing in width to West Java. Prism width varies from ~ 90 - 180 ?km and average surface slope from ~ 1 - 3 ° with a strong inverse correlation between width and slope, also observed globally. The <b>prism</b> <b>deviates</b> from typical taper geometry {{in parts of the}} margin, notably offshore North Sumatra where it is characterized by a steep toe and broad plateau. Along-strike changes in morphology are strongly linked to input sediment thickness. Sections of the prism toe represent key global examples of unusual landward-vergent thrusting. These sections correspond to a thick sediment input and to a wide prism with shallow surface slope. A low basal shear stress or backstop mechanism may drive this style of faulting. Prism morphology and structure appear to be driven predominantly by input sediment thickness linked to oceanic basement topography, with sediment properties, plate smoothness, and orthogonal subduction rate and obliquity also contributing, and no clear role of plate age or dip...|$|R
