40|$|A steel {{containment}} vessel was fabricated and proof tested {{for use by}} the Los Alamos National Laboratory at their M- 9 facility. The HY- 100 steel vessel was designed to provide total containment for high explosives tests up to 22 lb (10 kg) of TNT equivalent. The vessel was fabricated from an 11. 5 -ft diameter cylindrical shell, 1. 5 in thick, and 2 : 1 elliptical ends, 2 in thick. Prior to delivery and acceptance, three types of tests were required for proof testing the vessel: a <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>test,</b> air leak tests, and two full design charge explosion <b>tests.</b> The <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>test</b> provided an initial static check on the capacity of the vessel and functioning of the strain instrumentation.

40|$|Although the {{lifetime}} of plastic pipes is commonly determined by hydrostatic pressure tests which measure the mechanical resistance, thermo-oxidative degradation {{plays an important role}} in practice. It is, therefore, an important question to monitor the elemental processes occurring during ageing of polymers, namely the loss of stabilising additives and the degradation of the polymer. The diffusion of the phenolic antioxidant AO- 18, the processing stabiliser, and changes in polymer morphology during <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>testing,</b> have been systematically studied for pipes made of PE 80 and PE 100 using infrared microscopy in a quantitative manner. For both materials a parabolic concentration profile of AO- 18 develops over the pipe wall upon <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>testing.</b> Under comparable conditions of testing the loss rate was larger for the PE 80 than for the PE 100. An annealing of the polymer occurs upon ageing with a similar increase in degree of crystallinity for bot h materials. However, the PE 100 has an overall higher level of crystallinity, and it may be speculated that this is one of the reasons for the slower loss of antioxidant. The results from IR-microscopy are in excellent agreement with analyses of samples taken over the pipe wall by oxidative induction time (OIT) and extraction HPLC. The conversion of the phosphite additive PS- 2 to the corresponding phosphate as a result of oxidation has been quantitatively assessed. The total content of phosphate and phosphite was found to be constant, and almost no extraction is seen before 5000 h.

40|$|The thesis {{identifies}} the main hazards in <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>testing</b> as pressure wave, water jet, burst of water hose, fragment and projectile discharge {{as well as}} ejection of plug or end section. A test, where a pressurized vessel ejected a projectile, was conducted {{as part of the}} thesis. The aim of this test was to find the relationship between potential energy inside pressure vessel and kinetic energy in a discharged projectile. The results showed that the Baker formula together with the elastic energy of the expanded pipe, gave a good representation of the kinetic energy. Based on the results from the test, a risk analysis concerning pressure testing at TDW is made. The analysis involves hazards assessment through calculations. Existing safety walls are analyzed and mediating measures to lower the risk to an acceptable level are proposed. An assessment of the safety barriers concluded that only fragments and projectiles or plug and end section could breach the first two safety barriers. Fragments and projectiles will most likely perforate the safety walls, while a plug or end section will probably exceed the shear and moment capacities in the safety wall. The pressure wave, water jet and burst of water hose would most likely be confined by the first barrier. For the vessels and pressure tests considered in this paper, the thesis suggests three safety barriers to reduce the risk to an acceptable level. First safety barrier should be an existing safety wall. The second safety barrier is a closed off area between the first and third safety barrier. The third and last safety barrier is either an existing safety wall or a steel safety wall. To improve the existing safety wall, a steel plate should be attached behind the wall. The steel plate will increase the shear strength of the wall as well as preventing sections of the wall to collapse during perforation of projectile. The calculations indicate that either a steel safety wall or the existing safety wall can be perforated by smaller projectiles. Because of small projectile diameter and large velocity, the wall at impact location will undergo a local deformation. This will lead to smaller plastic deformation and less energy is absorbed by the wall. Large projectile will create a global effect on the walls. These projectiles will not perforate the wall, but instead apply large axial and moment forces to the wall. To improve the walls resistance against axial and bending loads, the safety walls should be bolted to the floor...|$|E
40|$|Composite {{tubes are}} a very good {{alternative}} to steel tubes in applications requiring low weight and high stiffness. For composite tubes to replace traditional steel tubes in demanding environments, {{such as in the}} subsea petroleum industry, more research on their behavior has to be made to qualify the performance. This thesis seeks to expand that knowledge by investigating the buckling behavior of composite tubes subjected to external hydrostatic pressure. To find a method of correctly predicting the stress and strain states on the tubes, a comparison between FEA and previously acquired strain data from external <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>testing</b> of a composite tube has been carried out. The composite tube had a length of 600 mm and a diameter of 100 mm and was filament wound with a layup of [89 ^∘_ 1 / 12. 7 ^∘_ 1 / 45 ^∘_ 1] and instrumented with optical fiber to acquire the strain data. It was found that by modeling the cross section of the tube elliptic with 0. 46 % (" 0. 46 % ovality") of the mean diameter added and subtracted to the major and minor diameter of the ellipse respectively, a very good match between FEA and the strain data was found. Using the same ovality, seven different layups were analyzed to find an optimal layup for withstanding external hydrostatic pressure. Based on the optimal layup assessment, the most optimal layup, [89 ^∘_ 2 / 12. 7 ^∘_ 1 / 89 ^∘_ 2], was produced. The tube was cut into lengths of 300, 400 and 600 mm to assess the buckling behavior and FEA matching's dependency on length. The tubes were instrumented with optical fiber for strain measurements and tested in an autoclave. It was found that the [89 ^∘_ 2 / 12. 7 ^∘_ 1 / 89 ^∘_ 2] layup performed well having a buckling pressure of 9. 75 bar for the 600 mm long tube, 2. 79 times that of the [89 ^∘_ 1 / 12. 7 ^∘_ 1 / 45 ^∘_ 1] layup, despite being just 33. 5 % thicker. To achieve a good match in FEA for the [89 ^∘_ 2 / 12. 7 ^∘_ 1 / 89 ^∘_ 2] layup, the fiber direction E-modulus had to be increased by 12 % to 37738 MPa, compared to the predicted E-modulus from volume fraction scaling. The high E-modulus was concluded as being due to low void content coming from post winding compression of the tubes with peel ply. The ovality needed to achieve matching for the 600 mm long tube was 0. 01 %. Based on the matching of the shorter tubes it was concluded that longer tubes with the same layup will need an ovality close to 0. 01 % to simulate correct strain behavior...|$|E

A <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>test</b> (hydrotest) is performed in order to determine a safe vessel static pressure.

It is understood that the use of a complete range of uncertainties of the nil ductility temperature increase is equivalent to the entire range of radiation damage that can be experienced by the vessel steel.

Parabolic concentration profiles of the stabiliser develop during testing indicating a loss of stabiliser, at both the inner and outer pipe walls. Raising the temperature of the water bath leads to a uniformly accelerated loss of stabiliser. An increase of the hoop stress accelerates the stabiliser migration at the inner pipe wall. The concentrations of Irganox 1010 averaged over the pipe wall as determined by IR microscopy were in excellent agreement with those obtained from High Performance Liquid Chromatography and Oxidation Induction Time (OIT) analysis. Diffusion constants were calculated from the stabiliser concentration profiles based on the Fickian equations using appropriate initial and boundary conditions.

40|$|Ice-structure interactions, where {{crushing}} is {{the predominant}} mode of failure, are characterised by zones of intense high pressure within the ice feature. This work investigates the mechanical and microstructural behaviour within these zones by using triaxial testing on laboratory grown freshwater granular ice. The latest {{interpretation of the}} behaviour of ice in high pressure zones during ice-structure interactions is presented, based on previous work at Memorial University of Newfoundland. A review of triaxial testing on ice is also presented. [...] Results of triaxial testing on ice indicate the existence of two separate but overlapping deformation mechanism regimes at high and low confining pressures. High microcrack densities followed by a reduction in grain size by recrystallisation and restructuring were observed in low <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>tests</b> (p 40 MPa) this was replaced by more intense recrystallisation and possible pressure melting at grain boundaries and triple points. [...] Triaxial tests {{were used in the}} calibration of a pressure-dependent constitutive model for granular ice. The constitutive model is based on continuum damage mechanics and uses the reduction of the standard Burgers body to a single non-linear dashpot to model the response of ice under high stress and high strain conditions. Results show moderate agreement with test data collected from ice damaged triaxially at constant deformation rate and loaded axially at high confining pressures,. More work is needed to improve the calibration of the model further over a wider range of confining pressures...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLarge, deep, well {{shielded}} liquid detectors {{have become}} an important technology {{for the detection of}} neutrinos over a wide dynamic range of a few MeV to TeV. The critical component of this technology is the large format semihemispherical photo-multiplier tube with diameters in the range of 25 to 50 cm. The survival of an assembled array of these photo-multiplier tubes under high <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> {{is the subject of this}} study. These are the results from an R&D program which is intended to understand the modes of failure when a photo-multiplier tube implodes under <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>pressure.</b> Our <b>tests</b> include detailed measurements of the shock wave which results from the implosion of a photo-multiplier tube and a comparison of the test data to modern hydrodynamic simulation codes. Using these results we can extrapolate to other tube geometries and make recommendation on deployment of the photo-multiplier tubes in deep water detectors with a focus on risk mitigation from a tube implosion shock wave causing a chain reaction loss of multiple tubes...|$|R
