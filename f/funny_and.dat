5|$|Jerry {{is unable}} {{to decide whether or}} not to tell George he is dating Marlene, but Jerry's ex-girlfriend Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) {{eventually}} convinces him that he should. After being informed, George informs Jerry he has no problem with him dating Marlene. The following night, Jerry asks Marlene to come to his apartment, but she tells him that it might be better not to date him anymore. Jerry asks her why, to which she replies that she did not think his stand-up comedy act was <b>funny,</b> <b>and</b> that she could not date someone if she did not respect what they did.|$|E
5|$|After Mary's death, Paul and Michael {{were sent}} to live with Jim's brother Joe, and his wife Joan, for two months, so as to let their father grieve in private. Jim {{depended}} heavily on his sisters, Jin and Millie, to help around the house. Jim later {{took part in the}} running of the household, as Cynthia Lennon remembered that when she and John Lennon used to visit Forthlin Road, Jim would often answer the door with his sleeves rolled up, a tea towel in his hand and an apron tied around his waist. When Paul later played at The Cavern during lunchtimes, Jim would drop off food there that Paul would later put in the oven at Forthlin Road. Ruth remembered that Jim was <b>funny</b> <b>and</b> musical with her, but also strict when she was young, and was insistent that she learned good table manners and etiquette when speaking to people.|$|E

5|$|Bart {{attempts}} to reinspire Krusty by showing him old episodes of the show, but {{he picks up}} on the repetitive nature of his own jokes, and binge drinks in anger. He passes out and has a vision of himself in Jewish Heaven, where he meets Rodney Dangerfield. Rabbi Krustofski then appears and tells Krusty that Jews {{do not believe in}} Heaven, and thus he should do more to help others. An act of kindness does not seem to make him happier, but Bart takes Krusty to the synagogue, where Rabbi Krustofski's favorite Rabbi recites Krusty's jokes on religion. Krusty therefore deduces that his father did find him <b>funny,</b> <b>and</b> sees him again in Jewish Heaven, where Jesus turns Dangerfield's water into a Bloody Mary.|$|E
5|$|In 1873 Busch {{returned}} {{several times}} to Munich, and {{took part in the}} intense life of the Munich Art Society as an escape from provincial life. In 1877, in a last attempt to be a serious artist, he took a studio in Munich. He left Munich abruptly in 1881, after he disrupted a variety show and subsequently made a scene through the effects of alcohol The 1878 nine episode illustrated tale Eight Sheets in the Wind describes how humans behave like animals when drunk. Busch's biographer Weissweiler felt the story was only superficially <b>funny</b> <b>and</b> harmless, but was a study on addiction and its induced state of delusion.|$|E
5|$|Mike Bullen {{vowed that}} he would not write a fifth series after the fourth ended so well in 2001, but was persuaded to write it when {{executive}} producer Andy Harries suggested he should kill off a character. James Nesbitt was not keen to return to do another series but Bullen persuaded him to by offering to have Adam's cancer return with fatal consequences (the character had recovered from a testicular cancer scare in the second series). Despite this, Bullen was unable to make Adam's death <b>funny</b> <b>and,</b> following a meeting with Harries, decided it should be Rachel who died. Harries scheduled a meeting with Helen Baxendale at the Groucho Club, where they discussed the development. The scenes where Adam talks to Rachel's spirit were inspired by Truly, Madly, Deeply and Ghost. Bullen co-wrote the script of episode three with Matt Greenhalgh.|$|E

5|$|Shooting began September 23, 1937 and was {{scheduled}} to end November 20, 1937 on a budget of $767,676. Filming began in-studio with the scenes in Susan's apartment, moving to the Bel Air Country Club in early October for the golf-course scenes. The production had a difficult start due to Hepburn's struggles with her character and her comedic abilities. She frequently overacted, trying too hard to be <b>funny,</b> <b>and</b> Hawks asked vaudeville veteran Walter Catlett to help coach her. Catlett acted out scenes with Grant for Hepburn, showing {{her that he was}} funnier when he was serious. Hepburn understood, acted naturally and played herself {{for the rest of the}} shoot; she was so impressed by Catlett's talent and coaching ability that she insisted he play Constable Slocum in the film.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{received}} a polarized response; critics alternately called the battles deep and satisfying or shallow and repetitive. Reviewers considered the combat mechanics to be simplistic while allowing for complex tactics, {{and others said}} that the requirement to actively defend against enemy attacks and enhance offense kept fights engaging. Others also praised the combat but considered the mechanics to be robust and elaborate, presenting a solid role-playing combat system concealed under the intentionally simplistic visuals. Some reviewers said {{that a lack of}} depth made combat gradually become repetitive; they said that even when combat is <b>funny</b> <b>and</b> engaging, {{by the end of the}} game the battles can become routine. Joystiq stated that defense was more interesting than offense because it relied on time-sensitive reactions to creative enemy attacks such as Al Gore giving a presentation. Destructoid said there are too few powers available for offense for the game to remain interesting for long. GameSpot found combat was too easy and lacking in challenge because of an abundance of supplement items such as health packs that were found more frequently than they were used, and powerful abilities that quickly subdued opponents. Others disagreed, stating that the variety offered in combat, such as character abilities, allies, weapons, armor, and upgrades, ensured it always felt fun. The effects of the enhancements were sometimes considered to be confusing, and typically relying on simply equipping the highest level item available. Joystiq said the special characters that can be summoned during battle were extreme in terms of power and entertainment value.|$|E

25|$|The 95+ page {{script was}} shot on {{location}} in only 12 days with some days shooting 12 pages in the day.

25|$|Will Hutchins as Coley. As Gashade's dimwitted friend, Hutchins {{was cast}} in the same burst of {{inspiration}} that Hellman had when he also thought of Warren Oates and Millie Perkins for the other lead roles in the film. Like Oates, when The Shooting began production Hutchins was already fully identified with the western genre, having starred for several years in the ABC-TV television series Sugarfoot, which ran from 1957 to 1961. Both Perkins and Hellman later recalled the actor as being a <b>funny</b> <b>and</b> charming man who never complained about the often adverse filming conditions.|$|E
25|$|One time Bob Burns, the hillbilly comic, {{was on the}} show, and {{he threw}} in {{a few of his}} folksy farm stories, which of course were not in Bill Morrow's script.

25|$|Comedy Against Humanity, {{which was}} an improvisational show {{inspired}} by the party game Cards Against Humanity, was one of Under the Gun Theater’s more successful shows.

In response to the closing of their show, the theater created a different interactive show inspired by the drinking game Never Have I Ever.|$|E

They decided that none of their existing characters were wicked enough to have killed Reg, so a 24th character, Nick Cotton was added to the line-up. He was a racist thug, who often tried to lead other young characters astray. When all the characters had been created, Smith and Holland set about casting the actors for the show.|$|E
