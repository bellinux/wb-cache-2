50|$|Justice George Shiras Jr. {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the Court. Malony had filed a bill of exceptions in the trial court which had not been signed by the judge who sat on the trial. Shiras concluded that a bill of exceptions which had not been authenticated by the presiding judge could not be considered by the appellate court. Since Malony's demurrer had been overruled, and the bill of <b>exceptions</b> <b>filed</b> was void, the Court had to rule on the facts as presented by the lower court. The judgment of the district court was affirmed.|$|R
50|$|The {{number of}} {{original}} jurisdiction cases {{heard by the}} court is small; generally {{only one or two}} such cases are heard per term. Because the nine-member Supreme Court is not well-suited to conducting pretrial proceedings or trials, original jurisdiction cases accepted by the Court are typically referred to a well-qualified lawyer or lower-court judge to serve as special master, conduct the proceedings, and report recommendations to the Court. The Court then considers whether to accept the special master's report or whether to sustain any <b>exceptions</b> <b>filed</b> to the report.|$|R

50|$|If an {{exception}} is not raised timeously, the defendant may not raise it {{at a later}} stage unless he has the leave of the court. The exception may not generally be raised during the trial. Once the notice of <b>exception</b> has been <b>filed</b> on the plaintiff, the exception has to be enrolled for hearing. This is usually done on ten days' notice (MC) and five days' notice (HC). A formal hearing thus proceeds where the party raising the exception (the excipient) has the onus of proof. The excipient must prove {{not only that the}} summons is defective but also that he will suffer prejudice if the court does not uphold his exception.|$|R

50|$|When the Supreme Court {{handed down}} its epochal ruling on May 17, 1954 in Brown v. Board of Education, the ICC {{initially}} {{chose to ignore}} it. In a September 30, 1954 ruling, ICC Commissioner Isadore Freidson stated that Brown had no relevance to the conduct of business by a private bus carrier. Citing Plessy v. Ferguson as well as 19th-century ICC decisions handed down prior to Plessy, and others which the Supreme Court had later overturned, Freidson argued that the non-discrimination language of the Interstate Commerce Act did not prohibit segregation. Roundtree and Robertson <b>filed</b> <b>exceptions</b> to Freidson's ruling in which they invoked both the commerce clause of the US Constitution and the Supreme Court's reasoning in Brown and applied it explicitly {{to the area of}} transportation.|$|R

50|$|Applying the Nantahala and Mississippi Power {{holdings}} to the Louisiana case, the Court {{noted that}} the PSC order impermissibly {{had the effect of}} trapping generation costs with the public utility by excluding them from recovery in rates. Although the Entergy System Operating Agreement differed from the tariffs in the Nantahala and Mississippi Power cases in that it left the classification of reserve generating units to an operating committee, this delegated discretion did not allow the PSC room for a finding of imprudence where a FERC mandated cost allocation would not. As Congress had permitted the use of automatic adjustment clauses in the Federal Power Act, the Court decided the MSS-1 schedule constituted such a clause. The Court then determined that {{there was no reason to}} create an <b>exception</b> to the <b>filed</b> rate doctrine for tariffs using this type of clause.|$|R
5000|$|Audio content {{encoded in}} a {{particular}} audio coding format is normally encapsulated within a container format. As such, the user normally doesn't have a raw AAC file, but instead has a [...]m4a audio file, which is a MPEG-4 Part 14 container containing AAC-encoded audio. The container also contains metadata such as title and other tags, and perhaps an index for fast seeking. A notable <b>exception</b> is MP3 <b>files,</b> which are raw audio coding without a container format. De facto standards for adding metadata tags such as title and artist to MP3s, such as ID3, are hacks which work by appending the tags to the MP3, and then relying on the MP3 player to recognize the chunk as malformed audio coding and therefore skip it. In video files with audio, the encoded audio content is bundled with video (in a video coding format) inside a multimedia container format.|$|R
50|$|Section 356 {{deals with}} {{suspicious}} activity reports (SARs). Part (a) {{states that the}} Secretary of Treasury was required to create regulations that require brokers and dealers registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to submit suspicious activity reports under section 5318(g) of title 31, United States Code. The regulations filed were 31 CFR 103.11(ii), which amended {{the definition of a}} transaction to encompass any instrument within the definition of security in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and 31 CFR 103.19, which requires suspicious transactions over $US5,000 be reported to FinCEN. 31 CFR 103.19 provides details on filing procedures, details several <b>exceptions</b> to the <b>filing</b> requirement and specifies that records must be retained for a period of 5 years by dealer-brokers. It also requires that reports made to FinCEN remain confidential and gives limited liability to the reporting broker-dealer for any disclosures to appropriate authorities. Failure to file reports may be a violation of the BSA.|$|R
30|$|Indeed, such regularities {{were also}} found in studies of file systems. Douceur and Bolosky [21] found that the {{distribution}} of file sizes on {{a very large number}} of personal computers running the Windows OS follows almost ideally a lognormal distribution (with the <b>exception</b> of <b>files</b> with zero size). On the other hand, Downey [22] found that while file size distributions on a UNIX workstation follow similar lognormal patterns, there are situations where the distribution is much better described (in its fat tail) by power law, shown especially in the case of Web servers [23]. A few years later, Tanenbaum, Herder and Bos [24] confirmed such differences, noting also that for a typical UNIX workstation the shape of the file distribution has remained quite stable, but shifted to higher values. The observed duality between lognormal and power law distributions has been explained and modeled by Mitzenmacher [5], who argued that a natural mixture of lognormal distributions can yield power law behavior (see also [6]). A recent study of the distribution of sizes of files available on the Internet by Gros, Kaczor and Marković [25] has analysed a very large corpus of millions of files, with sizes ranging from 10 bytes to over 10 gigabytes. The study indicated that for some file types (for example audio and video files) the distribution of sizes follows lognormal form for large value, but for other types (images, text) it is better described by a power law. The difference was argued to originate from human neuropsychology and the maximum entropy principle.|$|R

40|$|The {{identification}} of outliers in formatted datasets {{is a critical}} data quality issue, particular in the data review process. Having a long history, it culminated by Ronald Fehd establishing a set of powerful macros for performing range and logic checks on datasets and the writing of <b>file</b> <b>exceptions</b> to edit and use for updates. As {{a necessary condition for}} this approach, the existence of a properly written data dictionary containing the other=INVALID option for all format values is required. In practice, however, often one has to work with the formats that do not have the required structure, and, for various reasons, it is difficult to transform them in the form required. As a supplement to the established approach, we have created a macro that handles situations where the presence of the other=INVALID option is not obligatory in character, numeric regular and multi-label value formats. As an output of this macro, we obtain a table with the identifier(s), variable name, variable format, and an unformatted value, which can be used for future analysis...|$|R
