5000|$|Bard throws four pitches. About {{half of his}} pitches thrown are four-seam fastballs in {{the range}} of 92 - 96 mph. He also {{features}} a two-seam fastball (93 - 97), slider (79 - 83), and changeup (86 - 89). Bard's changeup is used almost exclusively against left-handed hitters. He uses the slider, too, against lefties, but much more so against right-handers. Bard's velocity on all of his pitch types dipped several miles per hour in 2012, presumably {{as a result of his}} conversion from a relief pitcher to a starter. Bard said he was mildly surprised, but not alarmed by the drop: [...] "I knew there’d be somewhat of a drop-off, velocity-wise, when I went to starting. I didn’t think it would be quite this big ... When I’m 93, 94, they’re just as late as they were on that 97.

This thing, it was balanced off the start of the race, and you know, I knew the first run when we were a little bit off, and the leaders were not getting away from us, I thought, we have probably got a shot at this thing tonight and a shot at a solid Top 5 or Top 3, but once we got a couple of runs in there, and it was Denny and I trading spots back and forth."

40|$|In {{a recent}} {{editorial}} in the THI Journal, 1 Dr. Ferguson wrote that he had learned two new words: “anabasis” and “apotheosis. ” He used the latter to describe {{the development of the}} original bulletin called Cardiovas-cular Diseases: Bulletin of the Texas Heart Institute into an international forum for the discussion of the sci-ence and diseases of the cardiovascular system that is today the Texas Heart Institute Journal. He ended the editorial with these words: “Now <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> find a use for anabasis [...] ” Since he described anabasis as “the advance of an army, especially a large-scale march or expedition moving inland from the coast, ” I think that the word expresses exactly the surge of percutaneous transluminal coronary angio-plasty. It is little known that Dr. Grüntzig, before per-forming his first PTCA, along with Drs. Hanna and Myler, tried his balloon in a patient undergoing coro-nary surgery. 2 The balloon was inserted via the coro-nary arteriotomy and advanced in a retrograde fashion past the lesion. The balloon was inflated {{at the level of the}} stenosis. After removal of the catheter, the artery was flushed without evidence of débris. Later, post-operative studies showed improvement of the diame-ter of the stenosis. This procedure took place in May 1977 in San Francisco, on the coast. An army of cardi-ologists toting all kinds of weapons 3 initiated a large-scale march, moving inland and implementing PTCA as an alternative to surgery in the treatment of isch-emic heart disease. Now this is anabasis. And what we surgeons have experienced since 1977 is close to katab-asis (a retreat following defeat) ...|$|E

40|$|Green {{fertilizer}} at {{planting time}} Cue: Normally, when the rains {{end and the}} dry months begin, we expect trees to drop their leaves and for the landscape to become increasingly brown. But in the lakeshore areas of Malawi, one species of tree is breaking the rules. The African winterthorn is very unusual; it is covered with green leaves throughout the dry season, but sheds them at planting time, when the rains arrive. This characteristic makes it a very useful species for farmers, and as a result, this African tree has now been successfully introduced in Asia and South America. Grown together with cereal crops such as sorghum, millet and maize- and even in flooded rice fields - the tree is able to improve soil fertility and provide much needed shade for people and livestock during the hot months. To {{find out more about}} this unusual tree, Patrick Mphaka visited Salima district, an area where for generations farmers have been leaving these trees to grow in their fields. He sent us this report. IN:		?It is not the most beautiful. ? OUT:		?. fast growing tree here in Salima, than to other places. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 10 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Robin Mlolo ending that report from Salima district in Malawi. The African winterthorn, Faidherbia albida is in fact able to grow well in many different environments, from low lying areas to high savannahs and woodlands. Transcript Mphaka	It is not the most beautiful of trees when you look at it. It has thorns. It sheds its leaves with the rains and is green during the dry season. When fully grown, it is a large deciduous tree to 30 metres high, crown wide and rounded. The list of its uses is endless. Welcome to the African winterthorn, also known as Acacia albida, or Faidherbia albida. Here, it is locally known as Msangu. Now that agroforestry, and Faidherbia albida in particular, is being promoted country-wide by the Ministry of Agriculture, this district has become a demonstration district. I came over to see what I never saw of the tree, and know what I never knew. I chatted with Mr. Robin Mlolo, a local farmer in Traditional Authority Maganga in the district. I found him working in his field. Mlolo	These trees are most useful here. We use them as soil fertility trees. And in most times in our gardens, we don?t apply fertilizer. These trees act as fertilizer in our fields. Mphaka 	For other trees, we avoid the cover which the leaves of trees do give to the crops because sunlight does not reach the crops. What happens with these big trees, do you tolerate them to hinder sunlight from reaching the crops? What happens? Mlolo		In other trees, there is a shading effect to our crops. But to this tree, which is Msangu, it is a special tree. This is how God has created it. In the beginning of the rains, is the time when it is shedding its leaves. Mphaka		So it sheds the leaves, it doesn?t have the leaves? Mlolo	Yes, during the cropping period, it doesn?t have leaves. Mphaka	But the leaves are there when people have harvested? Mlolo		Yes after harvesting, that is when it starts producing the leaves. Mphaka	And you use the leaves as fertilizers? Mlolo	As fertilizers. Mphaka	These are very big trees and they are very old indeed. Is there anything which the people here are doing to make sure that these trees do not finish as we know that most people use the trees for firewood as well as for making charcoal? Mlolo	Yes, there are many projects which are going on here in Salima, mainly in replanting this tree to other fields or other gardens. These projects are helping us also to maintain these species in our gardens. We know the usefulness of these trees, mainly the leaves. It?s hard for a farmer like me to cut down this big tree, Msangu. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> want, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> cut the branches and leave the whole tree. Mphaka		You do that because you know the usefulness of the trees? Mlolo		Yes, the usefulness of the tree. Mphaka		What are other uses which these trees are used for? Mlolo	These trees are mainly useful to us, we can use it as a medicinal tree. And also we can use it as a shade to people like us, and our animals mainly during the hot season, it?s when it gives the leaves while other trees are shedding off the leaves. We can also use this tree for poles, building our houses, whatsoever. Firewood, and also the pods of this tree, if they fall down, it can be as feed to our livestock. Mphaka	Oh I see. Like when I was coming over here, I saw that one of the big trees there has got a hole, and I found that there were some bees. Mlolo	Okay, okay, <b>I</b> forgot. We <b>can</b> also harvest honey in our trees. That is my honey. We can also put some beehives on these trees. You can see one over there. But do not go near, because bees sting. Mphaka	You use Msangu as we have seen, do you apply any amount of fertilizer in these fields? Mlolo	No, no, no. We don?t apply any fertilizers. The funny thing is that when we are using these Msangu trees, we can raise our crop production from 50 %- 250 %, which is similar to fertilizer application. Mphaka	And maybe we can say higher because for the fertilizer, you have to buy and you use some money there? Mlolo		Yes, yes, yes. Mphaka		Whereas this one is almost free? Mlolo		It?s almost free, yes. We do not use fertilizer here. Mphaka	How easy or difficult is it to propagate or to plant Faidherbia albida in other areas other than this lakeshore area? Mlolo	Here in our area, it?s a hot area. These trees favour hot areas. And you can see the soils are almost sandy. So it is a fast growing tree here in Salima, than to other places.
