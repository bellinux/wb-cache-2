50|$|Electrical appliances, such as lights, heaters, and <b>heated</b> <b>towel</b> <b>rails,</b> {{generally}} need to {{be installed}} as fixtures, with permanent connections rather than plugs and sockets. This minimizes the risk of electric shock. Ground-fault circuit interrupter electrical sockets can {{reduce the risk of}} electric shock, and are required for bathroom socket installation by electrical and building codes in the United States and Canada. In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, only special sockets suitable for electric shavers and electric toothbrushes are permitted in bathrooms, and are labelled as such. UK building regulations also define what type of electrical fixtures, such as light fittings (i.e. how water-/splash-proof) may be installed in the areas (zones) around and above baths, and showers. Contrary to some information provided with bathroom light fittings, sinks and basins do not affect bathroom zones, as a bathroom is solely defined as a room containing a bath or shower, by wiring regulations. It is nevertheless good practice to avoid installing unsuitable fixtures close to sinks, as damage from water splashes may occur.|$|R
50|$|Another meaning attested is a washstand, a {{piece of}} {{furniture}} equipped with basin, jug, and <b>towel</b> <b>rail,</b> and often with space to store the chamber pot behind closed doors. A washstand in the bedroom pre-dates indoor bathrooms and running water.|$|R

40|$|A new heating textile {{has been}} {{developed}} in the present research for thermotherapy treatment. The heating textile was developed by integrating a metallic fibre based heating element within {{the structure of a}} terry towel. A specially designed electronic control unit that comply with the medical standards was also developed for easy, safe and proper temperature regulation. The performance of this new heating system has been evaluated by conducting a survey that involves a group of 20 patients, who need thermotherapy and are also familiar with the conventional thermotherapy systems. Thermotherapy was performed on these patients by a physical therapist using similar conditions used for conventional systems and the different performance aspects of the <b>heating</b> <b>towel</b> (such as visual aspect, comfort, maximum temperature of use, ease of use, heating time) was rated in a scale of 0 - 5.

50|$|The <b>Heated</b> <b>Towel</b> Rack - The contestants must {{install a}} ground fault circuit {{interrupter}} outlet, {{in order to}} install a <b>heated</b> <b>towel</b> rack in their bathrooms. Rob, Matt and Charlene have no problems replacing the original outlet with the GFCI outlet; Dan is momentarily delayed by his color blindness, requiring Natasha to assist him in connecting the wires, while Ajay fails to comprehend the lesson and has to solicit Matt's advice to correctly hook up the outlet. Rob doesn't have any further issues in installing his rack, and passes in short order. Dan has trouble anchoring the towel rack to the wall due to trouble with the wall plugs and stripping screws, but otherwise passes. Charlene fails after failing to drill pilot holes to anchor in the screws and wearing out her screws. Ajay's rack is mounted, but he destroys his drill bit in making pilot holes and he cuts off his wall plugs after failing to fully recess them, so he fails. Matt also admits defeat without installing the towel rack after spending 80 minutes trying to install the anchors, compared to the 5 that he took to change the outlet.|$|R
500|$|Though {{the opening}} of the Savoy had brought about a marked change in how hotels {{provided}} services to its guests, Ritz was determined that his London hotel would surpass its competitor in their delivery. The Ritz installed two large lead-lined tanks on its roof to provide a steady stream of hot and cold water. [...] The hotel's bathrooms were all spacious with each having its own <b>heated</b> <b>towel</b> bar. [...] Every bedroom in the hotel was provided with its own working fireplace.|$|R
50|$|An oshibori can be {{moistened}} {{with hot}} water at an appropriate temperature or steam to make a hot oshibori, or placed damp into a refrigerator to make a cold oshibori suitable for use in summer. Sometimes in Europe it is more commonly known as Hot Towel. Restaurants usually use an electric appliance such as a heating cabinet or refrigerator for this.

40|$|Producing {{domestic}} {{hot water}} (DHW) with a {{ground source heat pump}} (GSHP) is challenging due to the high temperature (HT) of DHW. There are many studies proving the better performance of cascade heat pumps compared to single-stage heat pumps when the difference between the condensing and the evaporation temperature is large. In this system approach study, different GSHP arrangements are described and computationally compared. A two-stage heat pump arrangement is introduced in which water tanks of the heating system are utilized for warming up the DHW in two stages. It is shown that the electricity consumption with this two-stage system is approximately 31 % less than with the single-stage heat pump and 12 % less than with the cascade system. Further, both low temperature (LT) and HT heat pumps can run alone, which is not common in cascade or other two-stage heat pumps. This is advantageous because the high loads of the space heating and DHW production are not simultaneous. Proper insulation of the DHW and recirculation pipe network is essential, and drying <b>towel</b> <b>rails</b> or other <b>heating</b> coils should be avoided when aiming for a high efficiency. The refrigerants in the calculations are R 407 C for the LT heat pump and R 134 a for the HT heat pump. Investment costs are excluded from calculations...|$|R
5000|$|The rear {{suspension}} was significantly revised including a widened track, softer torsion bars {{and the addition}} of a unique Z-configuration equalizing torsion spring. On US, UK and Ireland models, the generator output was increased from 180 to 360 watts, and the entire electrical system was upgraded from 6 volts to 12 volts. The clutch disc also increased in size and changes were made to the flywheel. New equipment included a driver's armrest on the door and locking buttons on both doors. Safety improvements included two-speed windscreen wipers, reversing lights (in some markets), and a driver's side mirror. In accord with the newly enacted US Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108, North American models received a dual-circuit brake system, the clear glass headlamp covers were deleted; the headlamps were brought forward to {{the leading edge of the}} front fenders, and the sealed-beam units were exposed and surrounded by chrome bezels. (Throughout the rest of the world markets the 1967 model sold in Europe et.al. still retained the older headlights (including its counterparts in Latin America - especially the Brasilian market model retaining the pre-1965 bodystyle). Another oddity of the 1967 North American market Beetle is the rear bumper overriders (<b>towel</b> <b>rails)</b> - the overriders have a different shape unlike the older models besides the one-year only engine decklid.|$|R
5000|$|Few NBA {{teams have}} rally towels. The most {{significant}} team with towels is the Cleveland Cavaliers.

40|$|Purpose: To clarify {{epidermal}} {{effects of}} bed bathing using bar soap and water-dissolved liquid soap (liquid soap). Method: The subjects were 33 healthy female college students. Subjects' arms were cleaned by two methods, using bar soap and liquid soap. The following objective {{data were collected}} from the subjects: skin sebum, moisturization, pH, and feelings of skin conditions (rashes, redness, itchiness, and irritation). Results : 1. Cleansing effects of both methods on oily dirt seemed no different. However, bar soap might be able to clean dirt between skin ditches. 2. After cleansing by bar soap, skin tends to hold in more moisture, but drys faster. This may cause subjects to feel drier than when using liquid soap. 3. The skin pH was slightly alkalized after cleansing by liquid, whereas the skin pH stayed the same after cleansing by bar soap. However, this doesn't mean that bar soap remained on skin. 4. Skin redness was the most observed skin condition after cleansing. It might be caused by <b>heat</b> from cleansing <b>towels.</b> There was no relation between skin types and skin conditions after bed bath...|$|R
