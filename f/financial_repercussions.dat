40|$|The {{results of}} {{deliberations}} in multilateral fora are often considered ineffective. Decision {{making in the}} European Union (EU) and in particular its key intergovernmental body, the European Council, poses no exception. Especially {{in the domain of}} EU foreign and security affairs, the unanimity requirement governing this institution allegedly allows nationalist governments to torpedo any attempt to build up a credible European defense force and a unified foreign policy stance. In this article, we take issue with the claim that multilateral summits merely result in "hot air” by looking at whether and how decisions made during EU summit meetings affect the European defense industry. We argue that investors react positively to a successful strengthening of Europe's military component—a vital part of the intensified cooperation within the European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP) —since such decisions increase the demand for military products and raise the expected profits in the European defense industry. Our findings lend empirical support to the view that financial markets indeed evaluate the substance of European Council meetings and react positively to those summit decisions that consolidate EU military capabilities and the ESDP. Each of the substantial council decisions studied increased the value of the European defense sector by about 4 billion euros on average. This shows that multilateral decisions can have considerable economic and <b>financial</b> <b>repercussion...</b>|$|R

The majority of banks that offered {{this type of}} mortgage eventually suffered grave financial consequences, {{largely due to the}} lack of risk-mitigating processes within their mortgage portfolio. Guided by the stewardship theory, the purpose of this qualitative multiple case study was to explore the risk-mitigation protocols that 4 bank CEOs employed in Northern California used to mitigate the offering of this risky product. Semistructured interviews were used to elicit detailed narratives from these purposively selected bank CEOs on their experiences in risk mitigation. A review of company documents, core value policies, and member checking of initial interview transcripts aided in the overall reliability and validity of the final interpretations. After using Robert Yin 2 ̆ 7 s five steps of data analysis, six themes were derived from the final interpretations: risk management as a culture; leaders making prudent, calculated risks on their mortgage lending platform; risk committees set in place to oversee risk strategies; a fiduciary responsibility to grow responsibly; consistent guardrails implemented within the loan portfolio; and leaders using discipline, execution, and correct judgment. By implementing these risk-mitigation strategies, these specific banks were able to survive the mortgage recession with very little <b>financial</b> <b>repercussion.</b> These findings may influence social change by uncovering risk-mitigation strategies in an effort to alleviate this risky product being offered to consumers...|$|R

The importance and impact of the services and programmes are imperative to the citizens it serves; thus, the standard of work and efficiency provided by public officials is instrumental in achieving set priorities. Workplace substance abuse hampers service delivery and can cause damage to the employee, the public {{as well as the}} Municipality. Accidents, injuries or inability to perform functions by employees may have tremendous legal, <b>financial</b> and social <b>repercussions</b> for the City of Cape Town. This study seeks to evaluate efficacy of processes that seek to curb the existence of workplace substance abuse in the City of Cape Town, specifically within the Safety and Security Directorate. A qualitative and quantitative research methodology was applied. A combination of quantitative questionnaires, qualitative semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions were employed with employees in the Safety and Security Directorate. A purposeful sample was selected. The study results indicate that there is a prevalence of employees reporting for duty with a ‘hangover’. This is accepted as the norm, and staff are protected by their colleagues. The participating departments, Fire and Rescue Service and Metro Police, have highly stressful and traumatic working environments for staff to work in.

The analysis was conducted over multiple industry sectors using qualitative research techniques. The research sample included seven industry sectors, providing {{a response rate of}} 72 per cent (53 sources approached). The focus was on both B 2 B and B 2 C relationships to determine similarities and differences in <b>financial</b> and operational <b>repercussions.</b> The research findings indicate that the efficacy of the reverse logistics system can be undermined by lack of customer compliance, with losses of up to £ 140 million (B 2 B). In both B 2 B and B 2 C relationships, there is evidence of suppliers suffering financial loss due to customer non-compliance. Due to the small scale of the analysis and the breadth of the industry sectors investigated, these results are not generalisable, but do indicate that this is an area, which could undermine supply chain effectiveness. Practical implications – Non-compliance of this nature carries a direct and highly applicable cost for manufacturers and distributors in the practitioner arena. Suppliers within industry need to acknowledge this issue and manage their reverse logistics more effectively. This paper adopts an innovative focus on an understated feature of the reverse logistics cycle, i. e. the recycling of distribution equipment used to transport outbound and returned products.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2004. The {{exponential}} {{growth of the}} gambling industry in South Africa has been the consequence of liberalized gambling laws. Casinos that were previously restricted to the homeland {{regions of the country}} have now become a common urban phenomenon that is easily accessible. Casino developments are still at an early stage of development, but the wide-scale consumption and popularity of the product has generated numerous debates over the cost and benefits associated with the industry. Whilst proponents of casino developments tend to emphasize the economic benefits, the opponents highlight the inevitable social costs, generated by the industry. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the social and economic impacts of the Sugar Mill Casino and the Golden Horse Casino on the Mount Edgecombe and Pietermaritzburg communities respectively. These impacts have been assessed by making use of both quantitative and qualitative data sources. The findings suggests that both the Golden Horse Casino and the Sugar Mill Casino have afforded their respective communities economic benefits and growth opportunities in the form of firstly, the initial capital investment of the casinos, and secondly, by the subsequent revenues generated by the industry. However, the industry has also generated social costs that have been encountered mainly by those individuals who do not have control over their gambling practices, and are thus classified as problem gamblers. Problem gambling tendencies result in a host of psychological, <b>financial</b> and physical <b>repercussions</b> that are manifested at a personal and interpersonal level.

40|$|SMaRT-Pro² is an Industrial Knowledge Platform on the Sustainable Materialization of Residues from Thermal Processes into Products. It {{consists}} of three research institutions and more than 25 partners from industry, government and civil society. The Platform brings together expertise from chemical technology, materials and metallurgical engineering, civil engineering and building technology, applied mineralogy, economy, organization sychology and law. As such {{it is able to}} consider the whole implementation chain of sustainable valorization of waste materials, in particular solid residues and carbon dioxide, the two largest and most important waste products from thermal processes. This Knowledge Platform focuses on different types of waste-to-product valorization such as the production of a carbon sink, construction materials, and sorbents. Thermal processes constitute a bulk activity in metals production, waste incineration, glass industry, etc. They generally produce major amounts of solid waste materials, such as slag and fly ash. Rising prices of raw materials and growing awareness for environmental issues lead to a change in perception of these materials from waste to a potential product. However, this trend is still hampered by various barriers: unreliable low-cost technologies, uncertain and inferior quality of the material, underdeveloped legislation and markets for the resulting products, and poor societal experience with closing material cycles. Thermal processes also generate a vast amount of carbon dioxide which they emit into the atmosphere. The discussion concerning carbon dioxide is evolving rapidly, {{but it is clear that}} the emission of this greenhouse gas will become ever more regulated in the future. Limiting net carbon dioxide emissions will in this regard constitute a financial benefit for industry. Sustainable use of solid residues and carbon dioxide, the two largest and most important waste products from thermal processes, is an urgent issue both for the industry involved and society as a whole, considering the <b>financial</b> and environmental <b>repercussions</b> of their production. This Knowledge Platform aims at valorizing solid materials and/or carbon dioxide in high-value products by intensified processes and with clear prospects on the economic and legislative feasibility, ecological benefits and societal relevance. The generic goal of the Knowledge Platform is to strengthen knowledge on valorization of inorganicindustrial by-products and provide a formal latform that can enhance the closing of industrial material cycles in Flanders and abroad. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable use {{of solid}} {{residues}} and carbon dioxide, {{the two largest}} and most important waste products from thermal processes, is an urgent issue both for the industry involved and society as a whole, considering the <b>financial</b> and environmental <b>repercussions</b> of their production. This Knowledge Platform focuses on three types of waste-to-product valorisation: production of a carbon sink, construction materials, or sorbents. Thermal processes constitute a bulk activity in metals production, waste incineration, glass industry, etc. They generally produce major amounts of solid waste materials, such as slag and fly ash, containing oxides of silicon, calcium, magnesium, aluminium and iron, together with a multitude of heavy metals, chlorides and/or sulphates. Rising prices of raw materials and growing awareness for environmental issues lead {{to a change in}} perception of these materials from waste to a potential product. Thermal processes also generate a vast amount of carbon dioxide which they emit into the atmosphere. The discussion concerning carbon dioxide is evolving rapidly, {{but it is clear that}} the emission of this greenhouse gas will become ever more regulated in the future. Mineral carbon sequestration is currently mainly investigated on primary materials such as olivine and serpentine. Sequestration in alkaline waste materials, however, provides an interesting alternative because of high reactivity, on-site production and low cost. In addition, the reaction with carbon dioxide stabilizes the waste materials and often improves environmental properties. The concept of producing construction materials from waste materials is only slowly coming of age despite the obvious benefit of transforming low-cost input materials into potentially high-value products. The production of another high-value product, a sorbent to remove pollutants from liquid streams, has only very recently been investigated for some of the waste materials studied in this project, and is a promising industrial application for in-house treatment of waste streams. A successful approach requires a broad consortium with relevant expertise for the scientific investigation, but which at the same time can be easily tailored to a particular valorisation option that emerges. The Platform aims at this dual objective by bringing together all expertise involved and by focusing on the challenging aim of valorising solid materials and/or carbon dioxide in high-value products by intensified processes and with clear prospects on the economic and legislative feasibility, ecological benefits and societal relevance. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This article {{posits that}} the {{emerging}} employer-imposed health insurance fat tax regime subverts {{the public policy}} goal of achieving actual health and evidences two important systemic phenomena: first, that these fat taxes force fat people to cover their fatness, and second, that current legal structure permitting this practice ensures that society continues to cover up its anti-fat bias. American society, through {{the health care system}} and other mechanisms, has created a fat-thin dichotomy within which thin is good and fat is bad. Recently, employers began reinforcing this dichotomy by imposing on employees whose weight renders them “obese” on the Body Mass Index (“BMI”) certain additional health insurance costs – referred to herein as health insurance fat taxes. Employers use these health insurance fat taxes to unevenly pass through to employees the costs of health insurance coverage, in an effort to reduce their own contributory costs for that insurance. Simultaneously, employers reduce the insurance costs for thin employees who do not, at least based on their body size, drive up the overall costs of insurance. Essentially, health insurance fat taxes increase the costs of fatness, both fiscally and systemically, by imposing both overt and covert penalties for fatness. The overt <b>financial</b> and access <b>repercussions</b> speak for themselves. Covertly, health insurance fat taxes force fat individuals to cover their fatness. Professor Kenji Yoshino describes covering as a method of forced assimilation that occurs when individuals acknowledge and embrace the underlying identity, but are socially required to make that underlying identity easier for others to ignore. This article posits that health insurance fat taxes force fat individuals to cover their fatness by mandating a tacit acknowledgement that fat is bad and unhealthy.
