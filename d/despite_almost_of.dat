With knowledge of how the number, frequency and diversity of relationships influence performance, practitioners and academics can develop processes to improve teleworker social networks. This in turn will enhance the use of social capital and also facilitate shared attitudes and behaviors, which will lead to higher organizational commitment and promotability in a teleworking environment...|$|R
