I would like to know you, but feel that I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way and feel that were I to set eyes upon you I should exclaim, 'That is he!' Your outward semblance probably does not reveal your brilliant imagination; you have to be moved, the sacred fire of genius has to be lit, if you are to show yourself as you really are, and you are what I <b>feel</b> <b>you</b> to be—a man superior in his knowledge of the human heart.|$|E

[...] "I can feel your body / pressed against my body / Wrap yourself around me / Love to <b>feel</b> <b>you</b> throbbing", the singer sang amid moans, elements of house music, C Music Factory-esque beats and a saxophone loop. Chuck Arnold from Philadelphia Daily News noted the song's [...] "surprisingly frank dirty talk" [...] with the lyric [...] "I can feel your body/Pressed against my body/When {{you start to}} poundin'/Love to <b>feel</b> <b>you</b> throbbin'".

500|$|All {{of these}} new things {{entering}} my life are changing the way I view my purpose, but 'Dance in the Dark' in particular is about me wanting to live—but also, the song isn't called 'Dance in the Light'. I'm not a gospel singer trying to cross people over. What I'm saying is, 'I get it. I <b>feel</b> <b>you,</b> I feel the same way, and it's OK.' I {{hope and pray that}} I can inspire some sort of change in people subliminally through the show. They're singing 'Dance in the Dark,' but they're dancing and they're free, they're letting it out.

500|$|After [...] "Freakshow" [...] is Blackouts eight track, [...] "Toy Soldier", a R and dance-pop song {{reminiscent}} of Destiny's Child's song [...] "Lose My Breath" [...] (2004) that showcases a military drumroll and Spears singing about needing a new lover. In [...] "Hot as Ice", a R song featuring background vocals by T-Pain, she sings {{in a higher}} register: [...] "I'm just a girl {{with the ability to}} drive a man crazy / Make him call me 'mama', make him my new baby." [...] Blackouts tenth track [...] "Ooh Ooh Baby" [...] contains a flamenco guitar and blends the beat from Gary Glitter's [...] "Rock and Roll" [...] (1972) and the melody of The Turtles' [...] "Happy Together" [...] (1967). In the lyrics, she sings to a lover [...] "Touch me and I come alive / I can <b>feel</b> <b>you</b> on my lips / I can <b>feel</b> <b>you</b> deep inside". Kara DioGuardi said she was inspired by the relationship between Spears and her first son in the studio, saying: [...] "I would look at the two of them, the way {{they looked at each other}} and the way she would hold the baby. It kind of struck me as interesting. At times it'd be about a kid at times about a lover." [...] "Perfect Lover", an R song, has a propulsive, clattery belly-dance beat in which Spears sings lyrics such as [...] "Tick-tock / Tick-tock / Come and get me while I'm hot". The twelfth track is [...] "Why Should I Be Sad", a midtempo R song directed to her ex-husband Kevin Federline. One of the bonus tracks, [...] "Everybody", samples Eurythmics' [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" [...] (1983). It features Spears singing about the dancefloor in a breathy lower register.|$|E
500|$|Numerous hip hop {{fans and}} certain rappers mocked West for {{becoming}} [...] "sappy" [...] while others deemed the upcoming LP as a throwaway experimental album. Comparisons {{were drawn to}} Electric Circus, an album recorded by West's labelmate and close friend Common. MTV eventually interviewed Common to share his thoughts and views on the artistic direction of the album. Common expressed both his understanding and his support for West's intentions, stating [...] "I love it. I'mma tell you, as an artist, you wanna be free. I'mma do what I <b>feel.</b> <b>You</b> can't just cater to the audience. You gotta say, 'Hey, y'all, this is where I'm at.' For him to do an album called 808s and Heartbreak, you know that's where he is at this moment. I heard some songs, and I think it's fresh. I think the people are ready for it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Roth {{claims he}} later edited a single {{version of the}} album’s opening track [...] "Blue Flame Ford" [...] so that Stories would get more {{exposure}} but instead the band {{was sent back to}} the studio to begin working on their next album, <b>Feeling</b> <b>You</b> Up. At this point, the band became fed up by the lack of support they were getting from Capitol Records. They switched to a smaller, independent label called Thick Records and released <b>Feeling</b> <b>You</b> Up in 1997. Greg Prato of Allmusic gave <b>Feeling</b> <b>You</b> Up four stars, calling it [...] "an incredibly solid album, which easily could have fit into MTV and rock radio play lists at the time, if both outlets werent so obsessed with Limp Bizkit and Everclear." [...] The band toured briefly in support of <b>Feeling</b> <b>You</b> Up in the U.S. but had to cancel halfway through as Roth said Pickerel had some personal issues to take care of and the band broke up shortly afterward.|$|R

500|$|Martin {{influenced}} {{several of}} her songs. [...] While showering one day during rehearsals, {{she came up with}} the idea for a scene in which she would shampoo her hair onstage. [...] This gave rise to [...] "I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair". Built around a primitive shower that Logan remembered from his time in the military, the song became one of the most talked-about in South Pacific. To introduce another of Martin's numbers to her, Rodgers called her over to his apartment, where he and Hammerstein played [...] "I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy" [...] for her. [...] When Martin essayed it for herself, she sang the final 26 words, as intended, with a single breath, and fell off her piano bench. [...] Rodgers gazed down at her, [...] "That's exactly what I want. [...] Never do it differently. [...] We must <b>feel</b> <b>you</b> couldn't squeeze out another sound." ...|$|E
500|$|Postmodern {{cultural}} critic bell hooks {{cited the}} interaction in the Memphis train station between Thomas and the Japanese couple {{as one of}} the few examples of nuanced, deconstructive and subversive treatment of blackness in American film. In his original review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert proclaimed that [...] "he best thing about Mystery Train is that it takes you to an America you <b>feel</b> <b>you</b> ought to be able to find for yourself, if you only knew where to look." [...] He later included the movie in his Great Movies collection, comparing the movie favorably to Jarmusch's later efforts like Dead Man and The Limits of Control. In an April 2000 retrospective of Jarmusch's work for Sight & Sound, Shawn Levy concluded that the film was [...] "as much a valentine to the allure of the American way of pop culture as it is a cheeky bit of structural legerdemain without terribly much resonating significance".|$|E
500|$|After a one-yard Mike Pruitt run, Rutigliano {{called a}} timeout. A short field goal {{would have been}} the safe bet — that was all Cleveland needed to win. Rutigliano, ever the risk-taker, decided to go for a touchdown. The coach was {{reluctant}} to stake the game's outcome on the usually sure-footed Cockroft, who had missed two field goals and an extra point earlier in the game. The play he called was Red Right 88, a passing formation in which a slanting Logan would be Sipe's primary target, while Newsome was insurance. If everyone was covered, Rutigliano told Sipe on the sidelines, [...] "if you <b>feel</b> <b>you</b> have to force the ball, throw it into Lake Erie, throw it into some blonde's lap in the bleachers." [...] Sipe took the snap, dropped back and threw to Newsome as he crossed to the left. But Oakland safety Mike Davis leaped in front and intercepted the ball, cementing the Oakland win. The Raiders went on to win Super Bowl XV, while Red Right 88 became an enduring symbol of Cleveland's postseason stumbles.|$|E

You were too unlucky when we played them, today he was man of the match. But {{football}} can be like that. Sometimes you can be at the bottom and then be a hero again. I just had a feeling. I'm a great believer that when you have the right attitude everything else follows. He had a good run after the World Cup but then he made some mistakes and we had to support him. The squad get on very well. There was no finger-pointing after that game. He has saved us before in games and we had to keep faith in him." [...] Houllier also praised Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson: [...] "I wished him the best in the Champions League because he represents the best in English football, he congratulated every Liverpool player after the final whistle and that shows that he is not just a great manager but a great man." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{the video}} for [...] "Single Ladies" [...] was the {{cheapest}} and quickest {{of all her}} videos to produce, Beyoncé felt that it ended up being [...] "the most iconic... something special". It spawned a dance craze and inspired thousands of imitations all over the world, {{many of which were}} posted on YouTube. In an interview with MTV, Beyoncé expressed her appreciation of the public's response to the video, and stated that she had spent much time watching several of these parodies: [...] "It's beautiful to <b>feel</b> <b>you</b> touch people and bring a song to life with a video." [...] Nava also expressed his surprise at the positive reception of the video, and attributed its success to the video's understated, less-is-more approach. In an interview with Chandler Levack for Eye Weekly, Toronto director Scott Cudmore stated that the Internet age has impacted the way music videos are made, as well as perceived by an audience. Although Cudmore believes that the music video as a medium is [...] "disappearing ... from the mainstream public eye", he accredited [...] "Single Ladies" [...] with its resurgence, and stated that after the video appeared on the Internet, people began to [...] "consciously look for music videos because of its art".|$|E

[...] According to him, for fans of Dion's [...] "high-caliber" [...] power ballads, this is truly among the best ever and a highlight on All the Way... A Decade of Song. Longing for romantic attention, Dion sings, [...] "I want you [...] to need me, like the air you breathe/I {{want you to feel}} me, in everything/I want you to see me, in your every dream/The way that I taste you, <b>feel</b> <b>you,</b> breathe you, need you." [...] Taylor stated that Warren's trusty melody is wholly natural and free-flowing, while production from the usually rock-oriented Matt Serletic is [...] "sheer perfection".

[...] He struck out five, while giving up five singles, raising his record to 16–4, and tying Sabathia and Verlander for the AL lead in victories. [...] He {{became the first}} Rangers pitcher to win 16 games since Kevin Millwood in 2006. [...] It was his seventh win in a row, eighth {{straight}} road victory (a new Texas record), and 12th road win overall in 2009 (another new club record, and tops in the AL). [...] "I'm not doing anything different on the road than I am at home", said Feldman, who had allowed only one run in the last 26.1 innings. [...] "The preparation is the same. [...] I think it's a pretty humbling game, so you can't get too high or too low." [...] He became the first Rangers right-hander to allow just one run over four consecutive starts.

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from television critics. Aaron Kinney from Salon magazine {{said that the}} episode title showed that the creators at least still {{had a sense of}} humor, but that the episode demonstrated some of the flaws that caused the series to jump the shark in the first place: [...] "cheesy melodrama, deathly slow pacing, and a lack of coherence". John Keegan from Critical Myth was also negative about the episode and awarded it a 4 out of 10. He called it [...] "one of the worst episodes of the season", and hoped that it was no indication of what the series finale was going to be like. Furthermore, Keegan criticized the fact that David Duchovny did not make a cameo appearance [...] "either full frame or in the distance", given his history with the Lone Gunmen. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five, and noted that [...] "there's nothing celebratory" [...] about the entry. The two were highly critical of the episode's conclusion, calling it [...] "such a bland way of dying that for a moment, you <b>feel</b> <b>you</b> must have missed the point". Shearman and Pearson, furthermore, argued that [...] "The Lone Gunmen deserved better. No, worse than that—we deserved better." [...] M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, criticized the [...] "goofy tone" [...] of the episode, saying it felt [...] "very out of place" [...] {{within the context of the}} series.|$|E
500|$|According to The Sunday People, [...] "though {{critics said}} it was an affectionate tribute about a nice man. Van went on to urge fans not to buy it." [...] According to The Boston Globe, Van Morrison [...] "disdained the book". In an {{interview}} with The Boston Globe, Turner commented on this: [...] "He considers anything that reveals details of family background or anything like that an invasion of his privacy. He doesn't believe in biographies, and I do." [...] When the biography came out in hardcover, Van Morrison sent Turner 36 statements from the book that he called [...] "lies, gross exaggerations and innuendo". Van Morrison told Turner that none of the 40 individuals the author had interviewed for the biography were currently friends of his. The letter from Van Morrison to Turner concluded with: [...] "I am very sorry that you <b>feel</b> <b>you</b> are entitled to earn a living by peddling distortions and inaccuracies about me personally." [...] In his reply letter to Van Morrison, Turner wrote: [...] "You may not think you are 'difficult' or 'introvert' but other people do and have the right to express their opinions." [...] The Sunday Times reported that [...] "Allegedly, Van's management even considered buying up all 25,000 copies of the book to pulp them," [...] and this was also reported in The Independent. The Evening Times wrote that Van Morrison [...] "reportedly tried to buy all the copies of a biography by Steve Turner." [...] Representatives for Van Morrison did not confirm whether he attempted to purchase the 25,000 copies of the biography, and confirmed that [...] "representatives of the singer discussed various possibilities". Van Morrison's manager, Chris O'Donnell, said of the musician: [...] "He is not happy about books, period. He is an artist and stands up for himself – he doesn't want his private life raked over." ...|$|E
