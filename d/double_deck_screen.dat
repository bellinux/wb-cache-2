Closure of mines due to environmental problems force the industries {{to look for}} processing of mine wastes and old plant tails. It is in this context an effort is made to process some of mine wastes by nil waste technology yielding usable products for diverse industries thereby solving vexed problem of waste management and meeting the demand for raw materials. The clayey ferruginous bauxite reject sample from waste dumps of Kolli hills, Namakkaltaluk, Salem district, Tamil Nadu was subjected to characterization, process diagnostic amenability tests followed by process evolution studies comprising of of soaking, scrubbing, wet screening over 150 micron <b>double</b> <b>deck</b> <b>screen</b> oversize produced metallurgical grade assaying 46. 50 % Al 2 O 3, 1. 49 % reactive SiO 2 and 21. 70 % Fe 2 O 3 with 76. 8 % Al 2 O 3 distribution at weight % yield of 67. 0 and a dewatered screen under size cement / pottery grade concentrates assaying 28. 63 % Al 2 O 3, 32. 28 % Fe 2 O 3 13. 57 % SiO 2 and 20. 41 % LOI at wt% yield of 33. 0. A wollastonite mine reject sample from Sirohi, Rajasthan was subjected to beneficiation process comprising of [1] Rougher calcite flotation at - 150 mesh,D 8080 microns, 33 %S, pH 7 using 2 kg/t H 2 SO 4 and 1 kg/t of sodium oleate [2] two cleanings of rougher calcite float and recirculation of dewatered cleaner tails to rougher feed [3] Wet high intensity magnetic separation of Rougher tails at 19200 gauss. The above flotation –WHIMS process yielded a ceramic grade concentrate assaying 97 % CaO. SiO 2, 0. 49 % Fe 2 O 3, 1. 01 % Al 2 O 3 and 0. 45 % LOI at weight % yield of 75. 0. The cleaner calcite float assaying 45. 6 % CaO, 7. 20 % Fe 2 O 3, 4. 21 % Al 2 O 3, 5. 89 % SiO 2 and 36. 22 % LOI {{may be used as}} by-product as it meets cement grade...|$|E
40|$|Opencast and {{underground}} mining operations produce large quantities of dust as well noise due to increased mechanisation to augment production and enhance productivity {{to meet the demands}} of consumer industry. Exposure of miners to high concentrations of dust and noise may cause occupational health hazards like pneumoconiosis and noise induced hearing loss and other allied health risk. Health risk to miners from dust depends on dust size, concentration and duration of exposure whereas noise induced hearing loss depends on sound pressure level, frequency and exposure level of workers. Exposure of workers to dust concentrations and sound pressure levels beyond threshold limit values as prescribed limits by statutory enactments and guidelines may adversely affect the health of mine workers. To assess the status of dust concentrations and noise levels generated by various machines and exposure levels of workers, conduct of systematic dust and noise survey in mines is essential. It will help in assessing the situation vis-a-vis dust and noise standards so that effective dust and noise control strategies can be adopted to minimize their menace. Keeping this in view, this project work was undertaken to carry out dust and noise survey in an iron ore mine of SAIL. From dust and noise survey carried out in Bolani iron ore mines, it was observed that: -> The dust level at the mine site office was minimum (0. 14 mg/m 3) whereas the maximum dust level was found at the crusher plant area (3. 1 mg/m 3). The dust concentration at lump loading station, fine loading station, mine face and mine site office was less than safe working limit(3 mg/m 3) whereas at the washing plant and crusher plant area were found more than the safe working limit. -> The noise level at the secondary cone crusher was maximum (102. 2 dBA) whereas at the control room minimum (76. 2 dBA). The noise level at dumper, drill machine, drum scrubber, <b>double</b> <b>deck</b> <b>screen</b> and dewatering screen was more than 90 dBA which is maximum permissible limit for 8 hrs working period. Whereas the noise level at loading station, hopper, shovel, and control room was below the permissible limit 90 dBA. Hence we can say that the worker of the Iron Ore Mine, Bolani are working under high noise level more than the acceptable level. ->From the modelling of the Noise rating from Mamdani Fuzzy System, the noise rating for different machineries were determined and compared with the field data for the Noise Rating and it was found that the results were satisfactory...|$|E
5000|$|Pre-Screening: used to cost {{effectively}} remove {{gangue mineral}} species, whilst upgrading the phosphate content, and evening out mill feed grade. Two <b>double</b> <b>deck</b> <b>screens</b> remove oversized {{material that is}} then attrition scrubbed. The attritioned material is screened again to remove the oversizes “coarse rejects” with the undersized material returned to the plant. Hydrocyclones reject the “fines” fraction from the resulitng product. A high proportion of magnesia (>70%) reports to these coarse and fines rejects, together with some silica {{and most of the}} iron. The phosphate grade of the resulting mid-fraction is upgraded from a LOM average of 11.0% mined to a mill feed averaging 21.7% P0. Importantly also, this mid fraction is less variable with respect to grade than that of the run-of mine material, which assists control of the downstream flotation process.|$|R
40|$|Large banana <b>screens</b> with {{multiple}} <b>decks</b> are used {{extensively in the}} process separation of many valuable export commodities. They are high capacity vibrating screens with a curved profile. Discrete Element Method (DEM) modelling using non-spherical particles has previously provided significant insight into the operation of these dry industrial screens. Here we introduce the use of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to model the flow of slurry (water and fine material) through a <b>double</b> <b>deck</b> banana <b>screen.</b> This paper firstly reports on the underlying DEM model of the coarse particulate flow on a full-scale banana screen. We then use Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to model the transport of fine particle slurry over and through the <b>double</b> <b>deck</b> banana <b>screen.</b> Finally, we combine the DEM with SPH models using a one-way coupling to simulate the effects of adding a slurry flow to coarse particulates on the banana screen. The key outcomes from this study are that; SPH is ideally suited for the high speeds and the high fragmented and filamentary nature of the fluid flow through the <b>screen</b> <b>deck</b> openings; the fluid only (SPH) model of slurry behaves similarly to the DEM approach in that more fluid is screened as the velocity slows, except near the earlier panels on the top deck; and, use of a porous media derived from DEM in one-way coupled approach with SPH produces clear and reasonable changes in fluid structure, separation and wetting of the screens consistent with slurry behaviour. Specifically, the fluid layer was much thicker in the coupled case, with slurry being trapped inside a coarse particle bed and which is sensitive to the fluid viscosity. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

50|$|Deck - a deck is frame or {{apparatus}} {{that holds the}} screen cloth in place. It also contains the screening drive. It can contain multiple sections as the material travels from the feed end to the discharge end. Multiple <b>decks</b> are <b>screen</b> <b>decks</b> placed in a configuration where there {{are a series of}} decks attached vertically and lean at the same angle as it preceding and exceeding decks. Multiple decks are often referred to as single <b>deck,</b> <b>double</b> <b>deck,</b> triple deck, etc.|$|R
40|$|Banana screens {{are often}} used for high {{capacity}} separation of iron ore, coal and aggregates into different size fractions. They consist {{of one or more}} curved decks that are fitted with screen panels with arrays of square or rectangular holes. The screen structure is vibrated while a dense stream of particles flows over it and is separated according to size. The material discharging {{from the top of the}} deck is the oversize and may become a coarse product or be crushed and recycled to the screen feed. The material falling through the deck can be further separated by additional decks below. Each lower deck returns a product stream and the material passing out through the bottom deck is the undersize. In this paper, Discrete Element Method (DEM) is used to explore the separation performance of a full industrial scale <b>double</b> <b>deck</b> banana <b>screen</b> for a peak acceleration of 5 g. The separation efficiency of each deck is analysed and the individual contributions of each screen panel are assessed using outputs from the model. Residence time distributions for particles on each deck provide insight into both the transport characteristics along the deck and the separation performance through each deck. The top and bottom decks have very different flow behaviour with very different bed structure and motion. The stresses applied by the flowing particles to the screen cloths and the impact and abrasive wear on the screen surfaces are evaluated. Finally, the energy absorbed by particles provides insight into the extent of particle degradation produced by transiting the screen...|$|R
