5|$|Although the Advisory Board {{recommendations}} {{focused on}} wildlife and habitat management, they also touched upon the recreation of primitive, uncontrolled conditions. Revisiting fire ecology {{and the importance}} of fire, which had long been suppressed <b>in</b> <b>national</b> <b>parks</b> and other federal lands, the report recommended the use of prescribed fire as a cheap and natural tool for shaping the park environment.|$|E
5|$|Black currawongs {{are very}} common around picnic areas in Tasmania's {{two most popular}} National Parks, Freycinet and Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair, and are often fed by {{tourists}} there. The National Parks Authority tolerated this practice until 1995, when they found the birds were becoming a nuisance and began discouraging people from feeding wildlife. However, the agile currawongs are adept at snatching fragments of food left by picnickers so the birds may only ultimately be discouraged by an (impractical) ban on food <b>in</b> <b>National</b> <b>Parks.</b> Birds also take other items such as soap or cutlery from campsites to examine.|$|E
5|$|Expanding {{access to}} parks was {{a feature of}} many {{initiatives}} Jewell undertook as Secretary. A 2014 Secretarial Order set benchmarks to increase youth involvement, seeking to create opportunities {{for young people to}} play, learn, serve, and work <b>in</b> <b>national</b> <b>parks.</b> Jewell led the kickoff of the Every Kid Every Park program by leading fourth graders on a hike through Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area. The Every Kid initiative made every fourth grade student, and their families, eligible for a free one-year pass to every national park. Jewell also backed a 2016 initiative to expedite permitting for youth organizations to explore public wild lands on overnight or multi-day trips, particularly in less popular parks.|$|E

5|$|Lemurs {{have drawn}} much {{attention}} to Madagascar and its endangered species. In this capacity, they act as flagship species, the most notable {{of which is the}} ring-tailed lemur, which is considered an icon of the country. The presence of lemurs <b>in</b> <b>national</b> <b>parks</b> helps drive ecotourism, which especially helps local communities living {{in the vicinity of the}} national parks, since it offers employment opportunities and the community receives half of the park entrance fees. In the case of Ranomafana National Park, job opportunities and other revenue from long-term research can rival that of ecotourism.|$|E
5|$|The chief threats {{faced by}} the brolga, {{particularly}} {{in the southern part}} of its range, are habitat destruction, the drainage of wetlands, collision with powerlines, and predation by the introduced red fox. It is more secure in its northern habitat as the land is mostly unsuitable for farming and much of it is <b>in</b> <b>national</b> <b>parks</b> or private ownership, but changes in vegetation cover, encouraged by the rooting activities of feral pigs, may reduce the abundance of bulkuru sedge and may make the brolga more vulnerable by providing cover for predators.|$|E
5|$|As in all Norwegian {{national}} parks, motorized {{land transport}} is banned. However, on Svalbard {{this does not}} include snowmobiles. On the other hand, cycling is banned. The Governor can, however, enforce temporary bans on snowmobiles or even all travel within the national park. Use of helicopters and aircraft for sight-seeing are also prohibited. Polar bears are protected, but anyone outside of settlements is required to carry a rifle to kill polar bears in self-defense, as a last resort, should they attack. Most flora and fauna are protected; the right to gather established with the freedom to roam does not apply <b>in</b> <b>national</b> <b>parks,</b> although there are some exceptions. Hunting is permitted after explicit permit from the Governor, and locals have more access to hunting rights than tourists. Fishing is not permitted, although dispensations can be given.|$|E
40|$|Javan {{rhinoceros}} (Rhinoceros sondaicus) and Javan bull (Bos javanicus) <b>in</b> <b>National</b> <b>Park</b> Ujung Kulon {{are protected}} wild animals. A study {{to examine the}} presence of trematode eggs in their fecal samples was carried out. The fecal samples were collected based on the transec route <b>in</b> <b>National</b> <b>Park</b> Ujung Kulon. The presence of eggs in fecal samples was examined by filtration method. Trematode eggs were found in 56 % of Javan rhinoceros fecal samples and 73, 91 % of Javan bull fecal samples [...] Base {{on the size of}} the eggs it was determined that Javan bulls <b>in</b> <b>National</b> <b>Park</b> of Ujung Kulon were infected by Fasciola spp (17, 39 %) and Paramphistomum spp (56, 52 %). Javan rhinoceros <b>in</b> <b>National</b> <b>Park</b> of Ujung Kulon was infected with Fasciola spp (44 %) and Schistosoma spp (12 %). This study clearly showed that tramatode infection is commom among wild ruminants <b>in</b> Ujung Kulon <b>National</b> <b>Park</b> and attention should be taken to improve the health status of the animals especially Javanese rhinoceros and Javanese bull</em...|$|R

5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century common {{concepts}} of what should be protected <b>in</b> <b>national</b> <b>parks</b> invariably included formidable geologic features like mountains, geysers, or canyons. As Florida's population began to grow significantly and urban areas near the Everglades were developed, proponents of the park's establishment faced difficulty in persuading {{the federal government and the}} people of Florida that the subtle and constantly shifting ecosystems in the Everglades were just as worthy of protection. When the park was established in 1947, it became the first area within the U.S. to protect flora and fauna native to a region as opposed to geologic scenery. The National Park Service recognizes nine distinct interdependent ecosystems within the park that constantly shift in size owing to the amount of water present and other environmental factors.|$|E
5|$|During {{the opening}} days of 1994, Rewa moved southwards {{parallel}} to the Queensland coast; however, because it was located about 600km (370mi) to the north-east of Mackay, it {{was too far away}} from the coast for there to be any direct impact on Queensland. The only indirect impact was higher surf, from which several people had to be rescued from before the cyclone started to move towards New Caledonia during 4January. As Rewa affected Queensland for the second time, watches and warnings were issued for various parts of Queensland by TCWC Brisbane, who predicted a landfall near Mackay. On 18 January local disaster committees met to consider evacuating people, while people who were on vacation <b>in</b> <b>national</b> <b>parks</b> were alerted about Rewa by a helicopter. A military training exercise that was due to take place in Shoalwater Bay had to be cancelled, with army personal evacuated to Rockhampton to avoid being cut off by flood waters. Along the coast, several ports including Gladstone were shut with large vessels told to head to sea and small vessels told to batten down and prepare for the storm.|$|E
5|$|In East Africa, {{the blue}} {{wildebeest}} {{is the most}} abundant big game species; some populations perform an annual migration to new grazing grounds, but the black wildebeest is merely nomadic. Breeding in both takes place over {{a short period of}} time at the end of the rainy season and the calves are soon active and are able to move with the herd, a fact necessary for their survival. Nevertheless, some fall prey to large carnivores, especially the spotted hyena. Wildebeest often graze in mixed herds with zebra which gives heightened awareness of potential predators. They are also alert to the warning signals emitted by other animals such as baboons. Wildebeest are a tourist attraction but compete with domesticated livestock for pasture and are sometimes blamed by farmers for transferring diseases and parasites to their cattle. Some illegal hunting goes on but the population trend is fairly stable and some populations are <b>in</b> <b>national</b> <b>parks</b> or on private land. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists both as least-concern species.|$|E
