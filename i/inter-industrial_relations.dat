40|$|Tourism {{industry}} {{had been considered}} {{as the one that}} had great economic effects in many Japanese business circles until {{the early part of the}} 1990 s. But in recent years, most tourism enterprises are in financial difficulties, and it also exerts a bad influence upon the many regional economies. This paper brought out a limited condition of tourism buildup in region that is to prevent the rate of self-sufficiency in region from declining as well as a close relation between the tourism industry and others, through writing about the skeleton of study of <b>inter-industrial</b> <b>relations</b> and its application to tourism, especially the repercussion effect on production caused by the consumption of tourists and its calculating method, and so on...|$|E

The main objective {{is to develop a}} concept for quantifying the magnitude of sectoral coherence in models of the New Economic Geography. It is motivated by the suggestion, by Venables (1996), that `strategic industries` be identified in terms of their agglomeration potential. Using a partial-analytic approach, we focus on <b>inter-industrial</b> <b>relations</b> in a closed economy to draw conclusions regarding international trade. We ascertain that two factors have an impact upon the strength of industrial linkages: 1) the monopolistic scope of intermediate suppliers, in terms of (technical) substitution elasticity; and the share in downstream costs for intermediates. Within a simulation study, this paper applies this new theoretical concept to eight basic industries across ten European countries. New Economic Geography, Vertical Linkages...|$|E
40|$|There are {{structural}} {{characteristics of}} high dependent degree to public invesment, low ratio of manufacture in industrial structure, high excess imports in inter-regional {{balance of payments}} about Hokkaido economy. Kitami City depends more public invesments. The trend to reduce public investments is forcing to convert its industrial structure. It is the pressing subject to create new industry. There are some trials to create new industry in Hokkaido, {{but many of them}} are still in groping stage. This paper tries to explore the relative advantage in industry, the potential of natural and human resources, technology, the bud of new industry in this area. The strategy for local industries which are based on the trials in Okhotsk area depends on more effective use and to heighten value added, to match to enviroment, to remove inconvenience of living, to promote the use of IT, exchanges between the different type of industry, and to incubate new business. The factors in common among them are technological seeds and <b>inter-industrial</b> <b>relations.</b> It seems that it is possible for this area to develop new industry by piling up the those factors...|$|E
40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the relationship between}} commodity-production and financial network structures in the regional economy as dual conjugate systems. Material flows (raw materials, goods and so on) circulate in the commodity network as shown by Leontiev’s input-output balance model. Nonmaterial flows of property rights, money, and so on circulate in the financial network and reflect the movement of material objects in commodity networks. A network structure comprises closed and open circuits, which have fundamentally different characteristics: locally closed circuits meet local demand by supplying locally produced goods, thus ensuring self-reproduction of the local economy; open (or transit) circuits provide export-import flows. The article describes the mechanism of ‘internal’ money generation in closed circuits of commodity-production networks. The results of the theoretical study are illustrated by the calculations of closed and open circuit flows in the municipal economy model. Mutual settlements between the population and manufacturing enterprises are given in matrix form. It {{was found that the}} volume of the turnover in closed circuits of the municipal economic network model is about 28. 5 % of the total turnover and can be provided by ‘internal’ non-inflationary money. The remaining 71. 5 % of the total turnover correspond to the flows in the network’s open circuits providing export and import. The conclusion is made that in the innovation-driven economy, main attention should be given to the projects oriented towards domestic consumption rather than export supplies. The economy is based on internal production cycles in closed circuits. Thus, it is necessary to find the chains in the <b>inter-industrial</b> and inter-production <b>relations</b> which could become the basis of the production cycle. Money investments will complete such commodity chains and ‘launch’ the production cycle.
