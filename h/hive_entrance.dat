40|$|A set of twenty-four {{colonies of}} honeybees {{was divided into}} three groups, two of which {{received}} different intensities of artificial heat, applied by means of specially designed heating frames placed {{in the middle of}} the brood chambers, from 2 Jan. to 16 Mar. 1942. Heating the colonies reduced the area of brood present at the beginning of May without noticeably affecting the consumption of carbohydrate stores and thus had an adverse effect on the colonies. This conclusion is in agreement with that reached as a result of earlier work (Butler & Cockbill, 1942.) Colonies in hives fitted with top entrances were no stronger in the spring than colonies in <b>hives</b> with bottom <b>entrances,</b> nor did they show any significant difference in store consumption. No significant brood chamber temperature differences were found in hives fitted with top entrances as compared with control hives which had normal bottom entrances. During the period when heat was applied to the colonies by means of the heating frames the minimum brood chamber temperature was significantly higher in the heated hives than in the control, unheated, hives, this being especially marked in the case of the hives fitted with 6 W. heaters. Throughout the experiment the minimum brood chamber temperature of all the hives showed a close dependence on screen temperature. During the preliminary period before the heat was turned on a change of 1 d̀ C. screen temperature was associated with change of 0. 92 d̀ C. in the minimum brood chamber temperature in <b>hives</b> with top <b>entrances,</b> and a change of 0. 86 d̀ C. in <b>hives</b> with bottom <b>entrances.</b> After the heat was turned on the corresponding figures were 0. 84 d̀ C. for top <b>entrance</b> <b>hives</b> and 0. 67 d̀ C. for the bottom <b>entrance</b> <b>hives...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{mating flight}} is the riskiest {{period in the}} life of a {{honeybee}} queen. A major cause of queen mortality in apiaries may be the drifting of queens to foreign colonies. We investigated the effects of distance between <b>hives,</b> <b>entrance</b> orientation and worker activity on queen drifting. Only 4 % of queens drifted in our experiments, all during their maiden orientation flight and all to the closest neighbouring hive. Neither drifting nor the length of time it took queens to relocate their hive was significantly affected by either entrance orientation or distance between hive stands (2 m or 5 m). However, queens took significantly longer to identify their hive and were more likely to drift when the number of workers at the entrance was lower than that at the neighbouring hive. Our results show that drifting can be low even when hives are placed in pairs with only 2 m between pairs, and that worker activity has an important role in guiding returning queens on their maiden orientation flight...|$|R
50|$|Typically, T. hockingsi colonies invade local T. carbonaria hives. A common {{strategy}} is that T. hockingsi workers eject T. carbonaria young adults from the hive, {{which results in}} a shorter and less costly fight. The T. hockingsi colony still takes control of the <b>hive</b> <b>entrance,</b> but many fewer bees die {{in this type of}} battle. In their victory, the resources gained include pollen, propolis, and honey stores. This significant reward might explain why workers are willing to self-sacrifice in both the attack and defense of a nest.|$|E

40|$|International audienceApis mellifera {{experiences}} {{large population}} {{declines in the}} USA and honeybee health is affected by many, potentially interacting factors {{that need to be}} addressed through a variety of approaches. In this context, we evaluated the impact of nutritional manipulations on worker physiology and colony demography. Specifically, we manipulated protein availability by feeding colonies on royal jelly, low-quality pollen, or regular pollen stores. After acclimation to these treatments, experimental cohorts of workers were introduced and later assessed with regards to life expectancy, protein content, and intestinal stem cell proliferation. We also monitored their hives for the amount of workers, brood, and pollen trapped in front of the <b>hive</b> <b>entrances.</b> Workers that fed on royal jelly showed a reduced rate of intestinal stem cell proliferation at nurse bee age. Total soluble protein content of individuals and adult worker lifespan were not systematically affected. However, we cannot exclude an auxiliary role of poor nutrition to declining bee health by weakening the intestinal epithelium. In contrast to the weak experimental effects on individual variables, the brood production differed drastically among the experimental hives. Although not yet replicated, this observation might indicate that hive demographic plasticity rather than individual plasticity is important for acclimation to different food regimes...|$|R

40|$|Populations {{of honey}} bees and other pollinators have {{declined}} worldwide in recent years. A variety of stressors have been implicated as potential causes, including agricultural pesticides. Neonicotinoid insecticides, which {{are widely used}} and highly toxic to honey bees, {{have been found in}} previous analyses of honey bee pollen and comb material. However, the routes of exposure have remained largely undefined. We used LC/MS-MS to analyze samples of honey bees, pollen stored in the hive and several potential exposure routes associated with plantings of neonicotinoid treated maize. Our results demonstrate that bees are exposed to these compounds and several other agricultural pesticides in several ways throughout the foraging period. During spring, extremely high levels of clothianidin and thiamethoxam were found in planter exhaust material produced during the planting of treated maize seed. We also found neonicotinoids in the soil of each field we sampled, including unplanted fields. Plants visited by foraging bees (dandelions) growing near these fields were found to contain neonicotinoids as well. This indicates deposition of neonicotinoids on the flowers, uptake by the root system, or both. Dead bees collected near <b>hive</b> <b>entrances</b> during the spring sampling period were found to contain clothianidin as well, although whether exposure was oral (consuming pollen) or by contact (soil/planter dust) is unclear.

40|$|Honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) {{reproduce}} by swarming {{wherein the}} mother queen leaves the nest with approximately {{two thirds of}} her workers (the prime swarm). Several daughter queens are raised in the original nest, and these start to emerge shortly after the first swarm departs. One or several of these daughter queens may then leave the original colony sequentially with smaller afterswarms. Here we study the change in acceptance of former nestmates after colony reproduction using free-flying honey bee colonies. We used {{a total of four}} colonies each of which we divided to make four new colonies: two artificial swarms (the offspring colonies) and two colonies that mimic established ('old') colonies after swarming. The way the original (mother) colonies were divided allowed us to determine the relative importance of wax comb on cue divergence. Half of the divisions contained the original wax combs from the mother colony whereas the other divisions were not provided with comb requiring them to construct their own. We then tested the acceptance of former nestmates by introducing foragers at the <b>hive</b> <b>entrances</b> and observing the behaviour of guard bees. Our results did not show a consistent change in acceptance of former nestmates after swarming. In two out of four replicates, workers originating from the colonies that contained the original wax combs were rejected by guards from the initially comb-less colonies. This suggests that comb wax {{plays an important role in}} nestmate recognition. However, the remaining two replicates did not show a response; all former nesmates were still accepted two weeks after artificial swarming...|$|R
40|$|Samples of dead {{honey bees}} (Apis mellifera L.) were {{collected}} periodically from 4 different locations during citrus and stone fruit trees blooming season {{to evaluate the}} potential impact of agrochemicals on honey bee death rate. For the determination of mortality, dead honey bee traps were placed in front of the experimental <b>hives</b> <b>entrance</b> located in areas of intensive agriculture in Valencian Community (Spain). A total of 34 bee samples, obtained along the monitoring period, were analyzed by means of QuEChERS extraction method and screened for 58 pesticides or their degradation products by LC-MS/MS. An average of four pesticides per honey bee sample was detected. Coumaphos, an organophosphate acaricide used against varroosis in the experimental hives, was detected in 94 % of the samples. However, this acaricide was unlikely to be responsible for honey bee mortality because its constantly low concentration during all the monitoring period, even before and after acute mortality episodes. The organophosphates chlorpyrifos and dimethoate, as well as the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, were the most frequently detected agrochemicals. Almost 80 % of the samples had chlorpyrifos, 68 % dimethoate, and 32 % imidacloprid. Maximum concentrations for these three compounds were 751, 403, 223. ng/g respectively.

40|$|Chalk brood is {{a disease}} of {{honeybee}} larvae caused by the fungus Ascosphdera apis, which causes the death and mummification of sealed honeybee brood, and with the consequent weakness of the colony. It is widespread amongst honeybees in Europe and North America. In Africa the only report of chalk brood has been from Tunisia (Heath, 1985). The disease is spread by robbing, drifting bees and by the normal practices of beekeeping (Warhurst, 1998). Ascosphaera apis produces sticky spores, which are commonly present on adult bees and all surfaces within occupied hives. The disease develops only if the brood is physiologically stressed in some way, for example chilling. In Ethiopia, the existence of two adult honeybee diseases Nosema apis and Melpighamoebae me/// 7 /'caand their distribution was studied and reported (Gezahegn & Amsalu, 1991; Desalegn & Amsalu, 1999). Until now {{there has been no}} record on the existence of any honeybee brood diseases in the country. Materials and methods The survey transects and beekeepers to be surveyed were selected randomly. A survey was carried out around the Holetta area on beekeeper's colonies, and at Gedo demonstration site about 150 km west of Holetta. Following the brood rearing season October 2000 to January 2001, 276 colonies at 13 survey sites were inspected externally and internally for signs of chalk brood disease. Colonies showing any symptoms of chalk brood: dead infected larvae left uncapped by nurse bees in the comb cells, and mummies at the <b>hive</b> <b>entrances,</b> on the <b>hive</b> floor and on the ground perpendicular to the hive opening, were examined. From 13 apiary sites, larval mummies were collected from eight apiaries that were found to display positive signs of the disease. Overall 240 black mummies of honeybee larvae from 48 bee colonies (five per colony) were collected. Each mummy was macerated separately in a sterile mortar with distilled water to prepare suspensions containing Ascosphaera apis from each site. The suspensions were filtered through fine cloth and the fungus was grown in the laboratory, using Potato Dextrose Agar containing antibiotic to avoid any bacterial contamination, on petri dishes.

Here, we tested this hypothesis on five discriminator hives by using a behavioral assay. We used three amounts each of iso-pentyl acetate (IPA) and 2 -heptanone (2 H), which are the major components of the pheromones from the sting and the mandibular glands, respectively. Biologically relevant levels of chemicals were delivered to the <b>hive</b> <b>entrance</b> platform via an air pump. We found no effect of either IPA or 2 H: there was no change in guard acceptance of either nestmate (on average, 91 % accepted) or non-nestmate (on average, 30 % accepted) under any of the pheromone treatments compared to the pentane control (98 % nestmates accepted and 32 % non-nestmates accepted).

40|$|Ziel der Studie Die Varroatose ist eine Bienenkrankheit verursacht durch die Milbe Varroa destructor. Seit Anfang der 1990 er Jahre werden Bienenvölker erfolgreich mit Oxalsäure-Aerosolen gegen Varroatose behandelt. Es bestehen jedoch Bedenken hinsichtlich der Anwendersicherheit der Behandlungsverfahren. Ziel der vorliegenden Studie war es, die inhalative Belastung von Imkern durch Oxalsäure-Aerosole während der Varroatose-Bekämpfung zu ermitteln und zu bewerten. Methodik An der Untersuchung beteiligten sich 20 Imker. Eine Gruppe (n= 10) versprühte eine 3 %-ige wässrige Oxalsäure-Lösung mit einem Zerstäuber direkt auf die Waben (Sprühverfahren). Eine zweite Gruppe (n= 10) sublimierte 1 bis 2 g Oxalsäure-Dihydrat mit Hilfe eines beheizten Metallpfännchens über das Flugloch in den Bienenkasten (Verdampfungsverfahren). Pro Imker wurden 10 bis 21 Bienenvölker behandelt. In Atemnähe des Imkers wurden Proben der einatembaren und der alveolengängigen Fraktion luftgetragener Partikel nach der Membranfiltermethode gewonnen. Es wurde dabei auf bewährte Probenahmeverfahren des Berufsgenossenschaftlichen Instituts für Arbeitssicherheit (BIA) und der US-amerikanischen Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) zurückgegriffen. Die Oxalsäure-Belegung der Membranfilter wurde anschließend im Labor mittels HPLC bestimmt. Ergebnisse Der mittlere Anteil einatembarer Oxalsäure-Aerosole betrug beim Sprühverfahren 0, 22 mg/m³ (Spannweite 0, 07 - 0, 41 mg/m³), beim Verdampfungsverfahren 0, 23 mg/m³ (Spannweite 0, 01 - 0, 36 mg/m³). Der mittlere Anteil alveolengängiger Oxalsäure-Aerosole betrug beim Sprühverfahren 0, 15 mg/m³ (Spannweite 0, 03 - 0, 67 mg/m³), beim Verdampfungsverfahren 0, 07 mg/m³ (Spannweite 0, 01 - 0, 36 mg/m³). Zwischen den beiden Behandlungsverfahren zeigte sich kein signifikanter Unterschied. Schlußfolgerungen Alle gemessenen Einzelbelastungen lagen unter dem derzeitigen Luftgrenzwert (MAK) von 1 mg/m³ (einatembarer Staub) nach TRGS 900. Die Tagesexpositionszeiten waren deutlich geringer als der Bezugszeitraum von 8 Stunden. Da sich zudem die Varroatose-Behandlung auf wenige Tage im Jahr beschränkt, besteht gegen die Anwendung von Oxalsäure zur Varroatose-Bekämpfung unter den untersuchten Bedingungen kein prinzipieller Einwand. The use of {{oxalic acid}} for {{treatment}} against varroatosis by evaporation or spraying procedure is considered as highly effective and well tolerated by bees. However there exists doubt among beekeepers regarding user-security, {{in particular with}} regard to the evaporation procedure. So far no studies were present for this. The presented study shows that the existing exposure-limit for oxalic acid in the air at working places is clearly fallen below by both procedures. By appropriate use there is no risk {{to the health of the}} apiarist. At the Institute of Occupational and Social Medicine (Institut für Arbeits- und Sozialmedizin), University of Tübingen, Germany, user-security for evaporation and spraying procedure was examined the first time systematically. 20 beekeepers in southern Germany participated in October 2001 in the study. During the respective oxalic acid treatments air samples in breath proximity of the beekeepers were taken. These samples were analysed afterwards in the chemical-analytic laboratory for their oxalic acid content. The results were compared to the existing exposure-limit (MAK-Wert) for oxalic acid. The technical rule for hazardous substances „TRGS 900 “ of German „Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Arbeit“ limits the concentration of oxalic acid in the air at working places to 1. 0 mg/m³. Methods In October 2001 in the context of the presented study 20 beekeepers were accompanied along their oxalic acid treatments. 10 beekeepers used the Varrox-evaporator of Andermatt Biocontrol AG according to the operating instructions. 10 beekeepers applied the spraying procedure with a 3 %-solution of oxalic acid following a proven method. Each beekeeper treated 10 to 21 of his hives, 244 hives altogether. The beekeepers needed for their works an average of 100 minutes (8 minutes per hive) applying the evaporation procedure, an average of 111 minutes (9 minutes per hive) applying the spraying procedure. During this entire work-time the sampling device was filtering oxalic acid particles from the air surrounding the working place. In the presented study standard methods were implemented in order to ensure conformity to „DIN EN 401 “, defining the so-called breathable fraction of airbourne particles. The used sampling equipment is a developement of the German „Berufsgenossenschaftliches Institut für Arbeitssicherheit“ (BIA). The oxalic acid particles were filtered by mixed cellulose ester membranes of 0. 8 microns according to a method of US-American „Occupational Safety and Health Administration“ (OSHA). The membrane filters were inserted into a standardized air sampler which was connected to a power-stabilized air collecting pump and to a volume gauge. The air-sampler built onto a stand was put as close to the place that the oxalic-acid emerged as possible, without interfering with the beekeeper’s work. This was for the evaporation procedure within an area of 1 m and a something above the <b>hive‘s</b> <b>entrance</b> by which the Varrox-evaporator was introduced. For the spraying procedure this was within an area of 1 m from the place of spraying, approximately at shoulder height of the beekeeper. After completion of the sampling the oxalic acid carrying membrane filters were brought to the laboratory of the Institute of Occupational and Social Medicine, University of Tübingen, where further analyses took place. Oxalic acid was washed from filters by double-distilled water and was measured according to a proven method by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results Evaluation of data led to a clear result: None of the 20 participating beekeepers reached even half the exposure-limit of 1. 0 mg/m³. The average value of the 10 measurements on evaporation procedure was 0. 23 mg/m³, the average value of the 10 measurements on spraying procedure was 0. 22 mg/m³. There was no significant difference between both methods. To better comprehend these results we must briefly concern ourselves with the definition of the exposure-limit (MAK-Wert) : The exposure-limit is in such a way selected that for an employee no health damage is to be expected if he stays 8 hours a day during a working life-time at working places at which the air concentration of the respective hazardous substance doesn‘t exceed the exposure-limit. Thus, based upon the presented data, a commercial apiarist could use oxalic acid treatments during the whole year 40 hours a week without damaging his health. Conclusions With evaporation- and spraying-procedure of oxalic acid, beekeepers have possibilities of treatment against varroatosis whose effectiveness and beecompatibility have already convincingly been proven. The presented study dispelled reservations against both procedures concerning possible health risks, appropriate application presupposed...|$|R
40|$|Predator-prey {{relationships}} between sympatric species allow {{the evolution of}} defense behaviors, such as honeybee colonies defending their nests against predatory wasps. We investigated the predator-prey relationship between the honeybee (Apis mellifera ligustica) and the European wasp (Vespula germanica) by evaluating the effectiveness of attack and defense behaviors, which have coevolved in these sympatric species, {{as well as the}} actual damage and disturbance caused to the colonies under attack. Attack and defense behaviors were recorded in front of the hive to observe attacks at the <b>hive</b> <b>entrance</b> (68 attacks in 279 h) and at ground level on isolated and weakened honeybees close to the hive (465 attacks in 32 h). We found that V. germanica attacked the <b>hive</b> <b>entrance</b> infrequently due to the low success rate of this strategy and instead preferred a specialized attack method targeting adult honeybees at ground level, demonstrating opportunistic scavenger behavior. Individual honeybees usually responded effectively to an attack by recruiting an average of two nestmates, causing the wasp to flee, whereas collective balling behavior was only observed on four occasions. V. germanica does not appear to disrupt the foraging activity of the colonies under attack. We found that agonistic events supported by other nestmates were typically the most intense ones, involving physical combat and prolonged attacks {{at the entrance to the}} hive. These observations support the hypothesis that A. mellifera ligustica can adapt its behavior to match the severity of the threat and the context of the attack...|$|E
40|$|Honeybees {{have the}} ability to {{flexibly}} change their preference for a visual pattern according to the context in which a discrimination task is carried out. This study investigated the effect of time of day, task, as well as both parameters simultaneously, as contextual cue(s) in modulating bees ’ preference for a visual pattern. We carried out three series of experiments to investigate these interactions. The first series of experiments indicated that trained bees can reverse their pattern preference following midday breaks, as well as an overnight break, at the feeder and at the hive. The second series of experiments showed that trained bees are able to reverse their pattern preference in just a few minutes, depending on whether they are going out to forage or returning to the hive. The third series of experiments demonstrated that trained bees can significantly reverse their pattern preference at the feeder and at the <b>hive</b> <b>entrance</b> following midday breaks, Summary as well as after an overnight break; the bees could also learn to choose different patterns at the feeder and at the <b>hive</b> <b>entrance</b> within each testing period. The training thus imposed a learnt pattern preference on the bees ’ daily circadian rhythm. This study demonstrates that the bee with a tiny brain possesses a sophisticated memory, and is able to remember tasks within a temporal context. Honey bees can thus ‘plan ’ their activities in time and space, and use context to determine which action to perform and when. Supplementary material available online a...|$|E
40|$|The {{experiments}} analyze {{different forms}} of learning and 24 -h retention {{in the field and}} in the laboratory in bees that accept sucrose with either low (≤ 3 %) or high (≥ 30 % or ≥ 50 %) concentrations. In the field we studied color learning at a food site and at the <b>hive</b> <b>entrance.</b> In the laboratory olfactory conditioning of the proboscis extension response (PER) was examined. In the color learning protocol at a feeder, bees with low sucrose acceptance thresholds (≤ 3 %) show significantly faster and better acquisition than bees with high thresholds (≥ 50 %). Retention after 24 h is significantly different between the two groups of bees and the choice reactions converge. Bees with low and high acceptance thresholds in the field show no differences in the sucrose sensitivity PER tests in the laboratory. Acceptance thresholds in the field are thus a more sensitive behavioral measure than PER responsiveness in the laboratory. Bees with low acceptance thresholds show significantly better acquisition and 24 -h retention in olfactory learning in the laboratory compared to bees with high thresholds. In the learning protocol at the <b>hive</b> <b>entrance</b> bees learn without sucrose reward that a color cue signals an open entrance. In this experiment, bees with high sucrose acceptance thresholds showed significantly better learning and reversal learning than bees with low thresholds. These results demonstrate that sucrose acceptance thresholds affect only those forms of learning in which sucrose serves as the reward. The results also show that foraging behavior in the field is a good predictor for learning behavior in the field and in the laboratory...|$|E
40|$|We {{reported}} {{on the use of}} experimental procedures dealing with these behavioural skills in the assessment of pesticide effects. The relevance of the following methods are discussed: (1) use of automatic activity counters set at the <b>hive</b> <b>entrance</b> to establish the balance between outgoing and incoming worker bees; (2) observation of the homing flights of bees; (3) the analysis of the information encoded in the dances of returning foragers; and (4) recording of the conditioned proboscis extension response on restrained bees to evaluate individual learning performances involved in foraging behaviour. These behavioural assays could be developed for sublethal toxicity assessment. However, careful validation of the tests is needed before being used in a routine evaluation procedure. At a minimum, they are valuable tools to understand the mechanisms underlying insecticide toxicity...|$|E
40|$|Over a twelve-month period, pollen loads {{transported by}} Scaptotrigona fulvicutis Moure 1964 were {{collected}} from the workers corbiculae right after the <b>hive</b> <b>entrance</b> closure {{in an area of}} old secondary forest mixed with some exotic fruit trees and ornamentals. Once the pollen grains were identified, their monthly frequency in the samples and grouping by botanical family established that Mimosaceae, Myrtaceae and Sapindaceae were the most frequently visited. The workers harvested the pollen from 97 plant species distributed in 73 genera and 36 families, mostly: Stryphnodendron guianense (Aubl.) Benth. in April (57, 37 %) and Schefflera morototoni (Aubl.) Frodin in May (54, 73 %). The harvested pollen types abundance matrix showed that there was little species dissimilarity between the months, which resulted in the formation of two large groups...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{this study}} we {{investigated}} whether the microsporidian Nosema sp. affects the flight behavior of forager bees. Bees released 6 and 10 m away from the colony took longer times to return. The proportion of bees that did not return was higher in the diseased bees compared to the healthy bees when released 30 m away from the colony. That diseased bees get lost from the colony was also supported by a considerably lower rate of infected bees among the returning foragers compared to departing foragers. In a <b>hive</b> <b>entrance</b> orientation test, diseased bees scored lower than healthy bees, indicating impaired orientation skills. These results {{are in line with}} previous results on foragers infested by the parasitic mite Varroa destructor. The similar influence of Nosema sp. and V. destructor on flight behavior, in that foragers might not return to the colony, can be interpreted as a general response of honey bees to diseases to decrease pathogen load within the colonies...|$|E
40|$|For {{detection}} of Nosema presence OIE manual prescribes analysis of 60 bees collected from <b>hive</b> <b>entrance.</b> For quantification of infection levels however the same manual prescribes analysis of 10 “older” worker bees. Due {{to the growing}} concern that Nosema ceranae may be strongly involved in the colony loss phenomenon, routine analysis of presence of this pathogen in honey bee colonies is becoming more widespread, even in countries where Nosema disease was traditionally not a problem. It is therefore important to establish standard sampling and analysis protocols which couple repeatability and ease of field sampling, and which, together with observations on colony development and health status may {{provide the basis for}} the determination of Nosema disease threshold levels. These levels could represent a useful prophylactic tool for beekeepers and limit dissemination of the disease. Here we present comparisons between different kinds of sampling modes and sample sizes, and an overview of Nosema disease in several apiaries in Italy, with observations of seasonal differences...|$|E
