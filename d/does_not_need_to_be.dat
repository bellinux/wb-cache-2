5|$|An alloy of {{aluminium}} and gallium in pellet form added to {{water can be}} used to generate hydrogen. The process also produces alumina, but the expensive gallium, which prevents the formation of an oxide skin on the pellets, can be re-used. This has important potential implications for a hydrogen economy, as hydrogen can be produced on-site and <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> transported.|$|E

5000|$|Thomas Mowle and David Sacko {{describe}} [...] "soft balancing" [...] as [...] "balancing that <b>does</b> <b>not</b> balance at all.” These theoretical {{efforts are}} counter-productive, since Realism and unipolarity are compatible and structural realism should rather develop {{a set of}} hypotheses for a unipolar world: “Scholars <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> desperately search for signs of balancing, they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> soften balancing beyond recognition, and they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> stand watch for the first glimmering of a new multipolar dawn.” ...|$|R
5|$|Beef steak can {{be cooked}} {{to a level}} of very rare (bleu, a cold raw center), rare, medium rare, medium, medium well done, or well done. Pittsburgh rare is charred on the outside. Beef, unlike certain other meats, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cooked through. Food-borne human {{illnesses}} are not normally found within a beef steak, though surfaces can potentially be contaminated from handling, and thus, very rare steak (seared on the outside and raw within) is generally accepted as safe.|$|E
5|$|Finn and Jake race to Bubblegum's {{castle and}} find her {{tied to a}} chair, with Ricardio about to rip her heart out. Finn and Jake then fight Ricardio and manage to beat him up. The Ice King crawls into the castle and places Ricardio back into his chest. Later during dinner, Bubblegum tells Finn that he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> jealous anymore, but Finn denies that he was jealous in the first place.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the limited}} {{resources}} of many developing nations, funding vitally effects how emergency medicine {{fits into the}} health system. Preventive care is {{a crucial part of}} healthcare in developing countries, and {{it may be difficult to}} budget for emergency medicine without cutting into those resources. This is a particular problem for poorer nations such as Zambia, which had a per capita health expenditure of 23 US dollars in 2003. Regardless of the amount of preventive care available, health problems requiring immediate attention will still occur, and emergency medical programs could increase access to care. Kobusingye et al. argue that expanding emergency medicine <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unreasonably expensive, particularly if developing countries focus on low-cost but effective treatments administered by first responders.|$|E

5|$|In January2014, Iwata {{unveiled}} a ten-year {{strategy for the}} company based on quality of life products. The target was a new market outside video games. Developed under partnerships with Dr. Yasuyoshi Watanabe and ResMed, the first device in this initiative was a fatigue and sleep deprivation sensor announced in October2014. Unlike the Vitality Sensor, the sleep sensor {{was to be a}} stand-alone product that <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> worn. Following Iwata's death in July2015, analysts questioned whether Nintendo would continue the quality of life initiative. Despite a planned United States release in March2016, some suggested the product had been temporarily shelved, while others believed the product had been indefinitely postponed like the Vitality Sensor before it. The device was formally discontinued by February2016; however, Tatsumi Kimishima stated that research into quality of life products would continue.|$|E
5|$|A Standard Ticket {{contactless}} {{smart card}} for single or return journeys {{may also be purchased}} at the GTM for the payment of MRT and/or LRT fares. A S$0.10 deposit will be levied on top of the fare to be paid. The deposit will be automatically refunded through an offset of the fare to be paid for the third journey on the same ticket while an additional discount of S$0.10 will be given for the sixth journey on the same ticket. No refund of the deposit is provided if the card is used for fewer than 3 journeys. The ticket can be used for the purchase of single or return journeys to and from pre-selected stations up to a maximum of six journeys over 30 days. Fares for the Standard Ticket are always higher than those charged for the stored-valued CEPAS (EZ-Link and NETS FlashPay) cards for the same distance traveled. The ticket is retained by the user after each journey and <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> returned to any GTM or Passenger Service Centre. Identical to the usage of CEPAS cards, the ticket is tapped onto the faregate reader upon entry and exit.|$|E
5|$|First {{reported}} in 2003, {{the idea of}} using a form of the Atkins diet to treat epilepsy came about after parents and patients discovered that the induction phase of the Atkins diet controlled seizures. The ketogenic diet team at Johns Hopkins Hospital modified the Atkins diet by removing the aim of achieving weight loss, extending the induction phase indefinitely, and specifically encouraging fat consumption. Compared with the ketogenic diet, the modified Atkins diet (MAD) places no limit on calories or protein, and the lower overall ketogenic ratio (approximately 1:1) <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> consistently maintained by all meals of the day. The MAD does not begin with a fast or with a stay in hospital and requires less dietitian support than the ketogenic diet. Carbohydrates are initially limited to 10g per day in children or 20g per day in adults, and are increased to 20–30g per day after a month or so, depending on the effect on seizure control or tolerance of the restrictions. Like the ketogenic diet, the MAD requires vitamin and mineral supplements and children are carefully and periodically monitored at outpatient clinics.|$|E
30|$|Process {{coordination}} through tuple spaces, {{introduced by}} the programming language LINDA for parallel systems [4], supports decoupled communications in space (processes <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> know each other locations) and in time (processes <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be active at the same time). Besides that, this model of coordination provides some synchronization power.|$|R

5|$|The 1970 Bhola cyclone is {{the deadliest}} {{tropical}} cyclone on record, killing more than 300,000people and potentially {{as many as}} 1million after striking the densely populated Ganges Delta region of Bangladesh on November 13, 1970. Its powerful storm surge {{was responsible for the}} high death toll. The North Indian cyclone basin has historically been the deadliest basin. Elsewhere, Typhoon Nina killed nearly 100,000 in China in 1975 due to a 100-year flood that caused 62 dams including the Banqiao Dam to fail. The Great Hurricane of 1780 is the deadliest North Atlantic hurricane on record, killing about 22,000 people in the Lesser Antilles. A tropical cyclone <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> particularly strong to cause memorable damage, primarily if the deaths are from rainfall or mudslides. Tropical Storm Thelma in November 1991 killed thousands in the Philippines, although the strongest typhoon to ever make landfall on record was Typhoon Haiyan on November 2013, causing widespread devastation in Eastern Visayas and killing at least 6,300 people in that country alone. In 1982, the unnamed tropical depression that eventually became Hurricane Paul killed around 1,000people in Central America.|$|E
