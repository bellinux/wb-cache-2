40|$|Corporate {{investment}} decisions require managers to forecast expected future cash flows from potential investments. Although these forecasts are {{a critical component}} of successful investing, they are not directly observable by external stakeholders. In this study, we investigate whether <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of managers' externally reported earnings forecasts can be used to <b>infer</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of their corporate {{investment decisions}}. Relying on the intuition that managers draw on similar skills when generating external earnings forecasts and internal payoff forecasts for their investment decisions, we predict that managers with higher quality external earnings forecasts make better investment decisions. Consistent with our prediction, we find that forecasting quality is positively associated with <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of both acquisition and capital expenditure decisions. Our evidence suggests that externally observed forecasting quality can be used to <b>infer</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of capital budgeting decisions within firms...|$|R

40|$|Clickthrough {{data has}} been the subject of {{increasing}} popularity as an implicit indicator of user feedback. Previous analysis has suggested that user click behaviour is subject to a quality bias¿that is, users click at different rank positions when viewing effective search results than when viewing less effective search results. Based on this observation, it should be possible to use click data to <b>infer</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of <b>the</b> underlying search system. In this paper we carry out a user study to systematically investigate how click behaviour changes for different levels of search system effectiveness as measured by information retrieval performance metrics. Our results show that click behaviour does not vary systematically with <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of search results. However, click behaviour does vary significantly between individual users, and between search topics. This suggests that using direct click behaviour¿click rank and click frequency¿to <b>infer</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of <b>the</b> underlying search system is problematic. Further analysis of our user click data indicates that the correspondence between clicks in a search result list and subsequent confirmation that the clicked resource is actually relevant is low. Using clicks as an implicit indication of relevance should therefore be done with caution...|$|R

The relationship of <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> factor of mechanical systems to the thermal noise has compelled many researchers to search for materials with low mechanical losses. Typical measurements of mechanical quality factor involve exciting a mechanical resonator and observing the exponential decay of the amplitude under free oscillations. Estimation of the decay time allows one to <b>infer</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> factor. In this article, we describe an alternative technique in which the resonator is forced to oscillate at constant amplitude, and <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> factor is estimated by measuring the drive amplitude required to maintain constant oscillation amplitude.

40|$|Abstract We {{consider}} {{a population of}} agents that can choose between two risky technologies: an old one for which they know the expected outcome, and a new one for which they have only a prior. We confront different environments. In the benchmark case agents are isolated and can perform costly experiments to <b>infer</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of <b>the</b> new technology. In the other cases agents are settled in a network and can observe the outcomes of neighbors. We analyze long–run efficiency of the models. We observe that in expectations <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of <b>the</b> new technology may be overestimated {{when there is a}} network spread of information. This is due to a herding behavior that is efficient only when the new technology is really better than the old one. We also observe that between different network structures there is not a clear dominance. ...|$|R

In this paper we propose and evaluate a distributed approach to implementing this method.

We describe an ap-proach for automatically <b>inferring</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> and completeness of causal reasoning in essays on two separate scientific topics using a novel, two-phase machine learning approach for detecting causal relations. For each core essay concept, we initially trained a window-based tagging model to predict which individual words belonged to that concept. Using the predictions from this first set of models, we then trained a second stacked model on all the predicted word tags present in a sentence to predict in-ferences between essay concepts. The results indicate we could use such a system to provide explicit feedback to students to improve reasoning and essay writing skills...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a learning-based low-overhead channel {{estimation}} method for coordinated beamforming in ultra-dense networks. We first show through simulation that the channel state information (CSI) of geographically separated base stations (BSs) exhibits strong non-linear correlations {{in terms of}} mutual information. This finding enables us to adopt a novel learning-based approach to remotely <b>infer</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of different beamforming patterns at a dense-layer BS based on the CSI of an umbrella control-layer BS. The proposed scheme can reduce channel acquisition overhead by replacing pilot-aided channel estimation with the online inference from an artificial neural network, which is fitted offline. Moreover, we propose to exploit joint learning of multiple CBSs and involve more candidate beam patterns to obtain better performance. Simulation results based on stochastic ray-tracing channel models show that the proposed scheme can reach an accuracy of 99. 74 % in settings with 20 beamforming patterns.

Unfortunately, since manually verifying <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of <b>the</b> submitted results is hard, malicious workers often take advantage of the verification difficulty and submit answers of low quality. Currently, most requesters rely on redundancy to identify the correct answers. However, redundancy is not a panacea. Massive redundancy is expensive, increasing significantly the cost of crowdsourced solutions. Therefore, we need techniques that will accurately estimate <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of <b>the</b> workers, allowing for the rejection and blocking of the low-performing workers and spammers. However, existing techniques cannot separate the true (unrecoverable) error rate from the (recoverable) biases that some workers exhibit. This lack of separation leads to incorrect assessments of a worker’s quality. We present algorithms that improve the existing state-of-the-art techniques, enabling the separation of bias and error.

We propose a model in which heterogeneity in perceived product quality affects consumer adoption. If consumers experientially <b>infer</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of a technology, an increase in initial exposure to a low-quality product may inhibit subsequent diffusion. Incentives intended to speed up adoption may in fact have the opposite effect, if they propagate low-quality signals. We examine the predictions of the model using sales data for 11 hybrid-vehicle models between 2000 and 2006.

In light of this, we tested for interactions between these 2 cues. Participants viewed composite images of opposite-sex faces that had been manufactured in combinations {{of high and low}} apparent health and masculinity-femininity. Preferences for masculinity in men's faces and femininity in women's faces were stronger when judging the attractiveness of faces with high apparent health than when judging the attractiveness of faces with low apparent health. Similarly, preferences for high apparent health were stronger for judgments of masculine men's faces and feminine women's faces than for judgments of feminine men's faces and masculine women's faces, respectively.

40|$|While {{peptides}} carrying PTMs {{are routinely}} identified in gel-free MS, the localization of the PTMs onto the peptide sequences remains challenging. Search engine scores of secondary peptide matches {{have been used}} in different approaches in order to <b>infer</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of site inference, by penalizing the localization whenever the search engine similarly scored two candidate peptides with different site assignments. In the present work, we show how the estimation of posterior error probabilities for peptide candidates allows the estimation of a PTM score called the D-score, for multiple search engine studies. We demonstrate the applicability of this score to three popular search engines: Mascot, OMSSA, and X!Tandem, and evaluate its performance using an already published high resolution data set of synthetic phosphopeptides. For those peptides with phosphorylation site inference uncertainty, the number of spectrum matches with correctly localized phosphorylation increased by up to 25. 7 % when compared to using Mascot alone, although the actual increase depended on the fragmentation method used. Since this method relies only on search engine scores, it can be readily applied to the scoring of the localization of virtually any modification at no additional experimental or in silico cost...|$|R

40|$|General purpose blind {{image quality}} {{assessment}} (BIQA) has been recently attracting significant {{attention in the}} fields of image processing, vision and machine learning. Stateof-the-art BIQA methods usually learn to evaluate <b>the</b> image <b>quality</b> by regression from human subjective scores of the training samples. However, these methods need a large number of human scored images for training, and lack an explicit explanation of how <b>the</b> image <b>quality</b> is affected by image local features. An interesting question is then: can we learn for effective BIQA without using human scored images? This paper makes a good effort to answer this question. We partition the distorted images into overlapped patches, and use a percentile pooling strategy to estimate <b>the</b> local <b>quality</b> of each patch. Then a quality-aware clustering (QAC) method is proposed to learn a set of centroids on each quality level. These centroids are then used as a codebook to <b>infer</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of each patch in a given image, and subsequently a perceptual <b>quality</b> score of <b>the</b> whole image can be obtained. The proposed QAC based BIQA method is simple yet effective. It not only has comparable accuracy to those methods using human scored images in learning, but also has merits such as high linearity to human perception of image quality, real-time implementation and availability of image local quality map. 1...|$|R

Agents also observe privately the realization of a signal that is imperfectly correlated with <b>the</b> true <b>quality</b> of <b>the</b> good. Based on the queue length information and the signal realization, agents decide whether to join the queue and obtain the good or to balk. The time to produce the good is exponentially distributed. Agents arrive according to a Poisson process at a market and are served according to a FIFO discipline. We find that when waiting costs are zero, agents receiving a bad signal join the queue {{only if it is}} long enough. When waiting costs are strictly positive, agents do not join the queue if it is too long. Furthermore, there may exist a set of isolated queue lengths (“holes”) at which agents with a bad signal do not join. In equilibrium, queues are shorter for low quality goods and an agent is more likely to erroneously join a queue for a low quality good than erroneously balk from a queue for a high quality good. When decreasing the service rate, more agents may join queues for high quality goods, even when waiting is costly...|$|R
