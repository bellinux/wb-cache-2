Mining changes over <b>data</b> <b>streams</b> is both compelling and challenging.

Moreover, a MFC-append-based algorithm, called MFC-dynamic (Mining Frequency Changes of dynamic <b>data</b> <b>streams),</b> is proposed to find the frequency changes over dynamic <b>data</b> <b>streams.</b> Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that our algorithms meet the major performance requirements, namely single-pass, bounded space requirement, and real-time computing, in mining <b>data</b> <b>streams...</b>|$|R

And based on sliding windows, a sketch update strategy is given to store most resent granules. As the sequential sketches may be saturated with the increasing of <b>data</b> <b>streams,</b> this paper presents an optimization strategy to delete the absolute sparse patterns. Based on the sequential sketches, a sequential pattern mining algorithm is proposed for mining uncertain <b>data</b> <b>streams.</b> The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the pattern mining algorithm...|$|R

25|$|When {{performing}} lossy audio encoding, such {{as creating}} an MP3 <b>data</b> <b>stream,</b> {{there is a}} trade-off {{between the amount of}} data generated and the sound quality of the results. The person generating an MP3 selects a bit rate, which specifies how many kilobits per second of audio are desired. The higher the bit rate, the larger the MP3 <b>data</b> <b>stream</b> will be, and, generally, the closer it will sound to the original recording. With too low a bit rate, compression artifacts (i.e., sounds that were not present in the original recording) may be audible in the reproduction. Some audio is hard to compress because of its randomness and sharp attacks. When this type of audio is compressed, artifacts such as ringing or pre-echo are usually heard. A sample of applause compressed or an excerpt of triangle instrument with a relatively low bit rate provides a good example of compression artifacts. Most subjective testings on perceptual codecs tend to avoid using this type of extremely critical sound materials however this type of artifacts generated by percussive sounds is barely perceptible on the MP3 format due to the specific temporal masking feature of the 32 sub-band filterbank of Layer II on which the MP3 format is based.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Data streams are massive, fast-changing, and infinite. Applications of <b>data</b> <b>streams</b> {{can vary}} from {{critical}} scientific and astronomical applications to important business and financial ones. They need algorithms to make a single pass with limited time and memory. Mining <b>data</b> <b>streams</b> is concerned with extracting knowledge structures represented in models and patterns in non-stopping <b>data</b> <b>streams.</b> Clustering is a prominent task in mining <b>data</b> <b>streams,</b> which group similar objects in a cluster. Several clustering algorithms have been introduced in recent years for <b>data</b> <b>streams</b> {{that are based on}} distance, so they can find only spherical shapes. Therefore, density-based clustering algorithms are adopted for <b>data</b> <b>streams</b> with ability for not only discovering the arbitrary shape clusters, but also for providing protection against the outliers. In fact, in density-based clustering algorithms, dense areas of objects in the data space are considered as clusters, which are segregated by low density area (noise). However, in the clustering <b>data</b> <b>streams,</b> due to certain characteristics, it is impossible to record all the data. Micro-clusters are a technique in stream clustering that maintains the compact information about the data objects in <b>data</b> <b>streams.</b> Microcluster is a temporal extension of the cluster feature, which compresses the data effectively. In this paper, we intend to review the outstanding density-based clustering algorithms on <b>data</b> <b>streams</b> using micro-clusters.
