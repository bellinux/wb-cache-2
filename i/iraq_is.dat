25|$|Advocates of {{the concept}} cite {{improved}} standards of health and education, employment opportunities, liberal markets, developed natural resources and introduced improved governance. The first wave of benign colonialism lasted from c. 1790-1960, according to Mill. The second wave included neocolonial policies exemplified in Hong Kong, where unfettered expansion of the market created {{a new form of}} benign colonialism. Political interference and military intervention in independent nation-states, such as <b>Iraq,</b> <b>is</b> also discussed under the rubric of benign colonialism in which a foreign power preempts national governance to protect a higher concept of freedom. The term is also used in the 21st century to refer to US, French and Chinese market activities in African countries with massive quantities of underdeveloped nonrenewable natural resources.|$|E
25|$|The {{so-called}} {{shrine of}} Imam al-Dawr {{in the village}} of al-Dawr, <b>Iraq,</b> <b>is</b> the earliest known example of a muqarnas dome, although it is unlikely to have been the first of its type. The dome rests on an octagonal base created by four squinches over a square bay. Three levels of muqarnas rise over this and are capped by a small cupola. The muqarnas cells are very large and resemble small squinches themselves. It was finished by 1090 by the court of an Uqaylid vassal of the Abbasid Caliphate of Baghdad and, although there are no surviving examples from Baghdad at this time, the large number of muqarnas domes known to have existed there {{by the end of the}} Middle Ages suggests that it could have been the source of the type.|$|E
25|$|No {{official}} statement {{has been made}} on the reasons behind the choice of F/A-18 fighters as Australia's primary combat commitment, but it is commonly assumed that the obvious alternative of sending a substantial land force instead was considered to involve an unacceptably high risk of casualties, particularly given the possibility of house-to-house fighting in Iraqi cities. <b>Iraq</b> <b>is</b> largely landlocked, and Australia no longer has a fixed-wing naval aviation component; thus, a larger naval commitment could not be considered particularly helpful. The choice of the F/A-18 deployment rather than of the F-111 tactical bomber {{may have been due}} to the higher cost of operation of the F-111, and its use being limited to more politically contentious ground attack missions rather than more uncontentious tasks like combat air patrols.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{so-called}} Nouveaux Philosophes were split on their support. André Glucksmann called to vote Sarkozy, while Bernard-Henri Lévy voted for Ségolène Royal. Max Gallo, who had supported the left-wing Republican Jean-Pierre Chevènement in 2002, joined Sarkozy five years later. Pascal Bruckner and Alain Finkielkraut have also proved close to Sarkozy, {{although they did}} not declare support for him, but Sarkozy did support Finkielkraut after controversial statements made in Haaretz newspaper following the 2005 civil unrest. According to the journalist Jacques Julliard, the support of some French intellectuals for the 2003 invasion of <b>Iraq</b> <b>is</b> the root of their rallying to Sarkozy, following {{the creation of the}} review titled Le Meilleur des mondes (Brave New World). Pascal Bruckner, historian Stéphane Courtois, Thérèse Delpech, André Glucksmann, Romain Goupil, Pierre-André Taguieff, Olivier Rollin, and Pierre Rigoulot are frequent contributors to this review.|$|E
25|$|On 13 July 2015, the Iraqi Air Force {{received}} its first batch of F-16 fighters. In {{addition to the}} F-16's which are due to be delivered to the Iraqi Air Force throughout the upcoming years, 24 KAI T-50 Golden Eagles are expected to begin deliveries by April 2016 boosting the Iraqi Air Force's defense capabilities. On 5 November 2015, the first two Czech Aero L-159 light combat aircraft were delivered to Iraq. The first group of Iraqi pilots completed training in the Czech company Aero Vodochody on 9 February 2016. Iraq will gain a total of 15 Aero L-159s and Aero Vodochody will make 12 aircraft operable for the Iraqi Air Force. Two other planes {{will be used for}} the reconstruction of two aircraft into two-seaters, one will be used for spare parts. For nearly three years, United Kingdom has blocked the sale of L-159s because they contain British radar warning receiver. However, Prime Minister David Cameron agreed to overturn the ban in February 2016 and the sale to <b>Iraq</b> <b>is</b> proceeding.|$|E
25|$|International NGOs (INGOs) {{have found}} {{operating}} in Iraq highly dangerous to their staff, as between March 2003 and March 2008 94 aid workers were killed, 248 injured, 24 arrested or detained and 89 kidnapped or abducted. This {{has led to}} INGOs to either completely unwind their operations, or else go undercover {{and try to make}} their activities as low profile as possible. INGOs are not treated as neutral parties by large sections of the population due to their beginning operations alongside the invasion and receiving security and funding from the multinational force and the governments that it consists of. The security situation has also led to much of the management of aid programmes to take place abroad, thus lowering the effectiveness of the programmes and creating a fragmented response. Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute have discussed the importance of using local organisations and also understanding the violence not a single insurmountable challenge, but understanding various acts of violence more individually, sharing the knowledge between agencies and responding more appropriately - the formation of the NGO Coordination Committee in <b>Iraq</b> <b>is</b> a step in this direction.|$|E

500|$|While the {{transfer}} of Iraqi sovereignty was not decided during the summit, this transfer had some connections to the summit. First of all, {{the news of the}} unexpected transfer was made public during the summit. BBC News reports that Iraq's foreign minister Hoshyar Zebari, speaking after a breakfast meeting with Blair in Istanbul on June 28, [...] "slipped" [...] prematurely that the handover of sovereignty to his country was being brought forward to coincide with the meeting. Later that day, US National Security advisor Condoleezza Rice gave US president Bush during the summit the following note: [...] "Mr. President, <b>Iraq</b> <b>is</b> sovereign. Letter was passed from [...] Bremer at 10:26 am Iraq time - Condi". Bush scribbled in the margin of this note: [...] "Let freedom reign!". Bush then turned to British prime minister Tony Blair, seated next to him, whispered that the handover had happened, and the two men shook hands. Later that day, Bush and Blair held a joint press conference, in which they welcomed {{the transfer}}. Secondly, the news of the handover pushed the summit from the front pages.|$|E
500|$|A Journey drew a mixed {{reception}} from critics. Financial Times editor Lionel Barber {{called it}} [...] "part psychodrama, part treatise on {{the frustrations of}} leadership in a modern democracy ... written in a chummy style with touches of Mills & Boon". He wrote that it made Blair seem [...] "likable, if manipulative; capable of dissembling while wonderfully fluent; in short, a brilliant modern politician (whatever his moans about the media)." [...] Writing in The Independent on Sunday, Geoffrey Beattie said A Journey offered an understanding of Blair's [...] "underlying psychology." [...] John Rentoul, author of the Blair biography Tony Blair Prime Minister, was equally positive, giving particular praise to the chapter on the Iraq War. [...] "The chapter on <b>Iraq</b> <b>is</b> tightly argued in some detail, which may persuade those with open minds to recognise {{that the decision to}} join the US invasion was a reasonable, if not very successful, one, rather than a conspiracy against life, the universe and everything decent," [...] he said. Mary Ann Sieghart, writing for The Independent said, [...] "whatever its faults, and toe-curling passages, [...] has many good lessons on how to succeed in both opposition and government.|$|E
500|$|In Chomsky's view, the {{invasion}} of Iraq by a U.S. and U.K. coalition must {{be seen in the}} wider context of the U.S. government's Imperial Grand Strategy. He claims that the Iraq invasion fits the three criteria that he has highlighted for being classified as a U.S. target for preventative war. Considering the country [...] "virtually defenseless" [...] against the superior might of the western armed forces, he also notes that securing control of the country would be an important move for the U.S. socio-economic elite, gaining unlimited access to the country's lucrative oil resources and asserting their own military might to intimidate other nations into compliance. He also argued that government and media propaganda also set out to forge an erroneous link between Iraq President Saddam Hussein and Al-Qaeda, playing on the American people's horror of the 9/11 attacks. Furthermore, he stated that they also wrongly claimed that the Iraqi government was developing weapons of mass destruction to be used against the U.S. or its allies. Chomsky remarks that the 2003 invasion of <b>Iraq</b> <b>is</b> particularly significant because it signals the [...] "new norm" [...] in international relations, and that in future the U.S. might be willing to wage a preventative war against [...] "Iran, Syria, the Andean region, and a number of others." ...|$|E
