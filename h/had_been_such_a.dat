Stratemeyer had created the Hardy Boys series in 1926 (although the first volumes were not published until 1927), which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> success that he decided on a similar series for girls, featuring an amateur girl detective as the heroine. While Stratemeyer believed that a woman's place was in the home, {{he was aware that}} the Hardy Boys books were popular with girl readers and wished to capitalize on girls' interest in mysteries by offering a strong female heroine.|$|E

25|$|By late December 1764 rumors {{had begun}} {{circulating}} {{that there might}} be a pair of beasts behind the killings.

Some contemporary accounts suggest the creature had been seen with another such animal, while others thought the beast was with its young.|$|E
25|$|Hardy {{frequently}} conceived of, {{and wrote}} about, supernatural forces, {{particularly those that}} control the universe through indifference or caprice, a force he called The Immanent Will. He also showed in his writing some degree of fascination with ghosts and spirits. Even so, he retained a strong emotional attachment to the Christian liturgy and church rituals, particularly as manifested in rural communities, that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> formative influence in his early years, and Biblical references can be found woven throughout many of Hardy's novels.|$|E

In one encounter, 13 Zeros shot down 27 I-15s and I-16s in under three minutes without loss.

In a one-sided series which Australia won 4-0, with one match drawn, Nicholson took only three catches in the first four matches, and, after making 0 in both innings of the fourth Test, was dropped for the fifth match in favour of Edward van der Merwe. He batted low in the order and made just 76 runs in eight innings, one of them not out.|$|E
25|$|On the {{theoretical}} level, Bordiga developed {{an understanding of}} the Soviet Union as a capitalist society. Bordiga's writings on the capitalist nature of the Soviet economy, in contrast to those produced by the Trotskyists, also focused on the agrarian sector. In analyzing the agriculture of the Soviet Union, Bordiga sought to display the capitalist social relations that existed in the kolkhoz and sovkhoz, one a cooperative farm and the other a wage-labor state farm. In particular, he emphasized how much of the national agrarian produce came from small, privately owned plots (writing in 1950) and predicted the rates at which the Soviet Union would start importing wheat after Russia <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> large exporter from the 1880s to 1914.|$|E

25|$|The {{loss of the}} Light Brigade <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> {{traumatic}} event that the allies were incapable of further action that day. Of the 666 men known to have ridden in the charge (sources vary slightly), 271 became casualties: 110 killed (less than 17%), 129 wounded, plus another 32 wounded and taken prisoner. Additionally, 375 horses were killed. Raglan could not now risk using his infantry divisions in any attempt to move Liprandi's forces from the Causeway Heights. Even if the redoubts were retaken, {{they would have to}} be defended by men whose priority was the siege of Sevastopol, and he dared not expose his supply base at Balaclava to further Russian attacks. The British 1st and 4th Infantry Divisions, therefore, returned to the plateau, the former without its Highland regiments who were ordered to remain in the valley under Campbell’s command.|$|E
25|$|After {{his return}} to the front, he was wounded in the throat by a sniper's bullet. At 6ft 2 in (1.88 m) Orwell was {{considerably}} taller than the Spanish fighters and had been warned against standing against the trench parapet. Unable to speak, and with blood pouring from his mouth, Orwell was carried on a stretcher to Siétamo, loaded on an ambulance and after a bumpy journey via Barbastro arrived at the hospital at Lérida. He recovered sufficiently to get up and on 27 May 1937 was sent on to Tarragona and two days later to a POUM sanatorium in the suburbs of Barcelona. The bullet had missed his main artery by the barest margin and his voice was barely audible. It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> clean shot that the wound immediately went through the process of cauterisation. He received electrotherapy treatment and was declared medically unfit for service.|$|E

Grin attempted to change the art style to fit more with traditional Final Fantasy games, but still did not receive any positive feedback. In response, Grin sent Square Enix an image of one of the latter's own games, Final Fantasy XII, and were told that it does not look like a game in Final Fantasys style. Following that exchange, Grin {{came to the conclusion that}} there was no longer any way to satisfy the publisher.|$|E

He was never told he had cancer, but before his death, had surmised it. He was able to leave the {{hospital}} for a few short trips, including a final visit to Baltimore. On July 26, 1948, Ruth left the hospital to attend the premiere of the film The Babe Ruth Story. Shortly thereafter, Ruth returned to the hospital for the final time. He was barely able to speak. Ruth's condition gradually grew worse; only a few visitors were allowed to see him, one of whom was National League president and future Commissioner of Baseball Ford Frick. [...] "Ruth was so thin it was unbelievable. He <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> big man and his arms were just skinny little bones, and his face was so haggard", Frick said years later.|$|E

Despite that, Votta was pleased by Sam's return as was Bell, who thought {{it was one of the}} more enjoyable aspects of the episode. Sam's scene with Blaine, however, was met with criticism, but of Blaine's characterization, not Sam's: BuddyTV John Kubicek pointed out that Blaine [...] "essentially calls Sam a whore" [...] and that [...] "he's like a completely different person". Vicki Hyman of The Star-Ledger described the scene as [...] "pretty out of character" [...] for Blaine, and The Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson said that the entire subplot, including Finn's antagonism toward Blaine, was [...] "so sloppily assembled" [...] he was glad it was ended in the following scene. The confrontation between Kurt and Sebastian over Blaine was little remarked on—West enjoyed it, but said she had been hoping for more.|$|E

[...] In 2010, Bell told The Aquarian Weekly: [...] "Pinkerton has definitely taken {{on a life of its}} own and became more successful and more accepted ... As an artist, you just have to do what you believe in at the time, whether it’s accepted or not. You just have to keep going with it." [...] In 2015, following the Pinkerton reissue and the [...] "Memories" [...] tour, in which Weezer performed Blue and Pinkerton in their entirety, Cuomo said:The experience of learning those songs again, singing them every night, working on them with the guys, and then being in a relatively small venue with 1,000 of the most hardcore Weezer fans and hearing them sing every syllable, seeing them air-drum all the fills—it was such an amazing experience and so different from what we'd been doing the years before that ...
