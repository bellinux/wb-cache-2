50|$|The Designated Providers of the US Family Health Plan {{have been}} {{delivering}} healthcare to military beneficiaries for over 30 years. In 1981, Congress enacted the Omnibus Reconciliation Act http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d097:HR03982: designating certain former U.S. Public Health Service facilities as Uniformed Services Treatment Facilities (USTFs). The following year, the Department of Defense assumed {{responsibility for the}} USTF program from the Department of Health and Human Services. In 1993, the USTFs developed a managed care plan, called the Uniformed Services Family Health Plan, and in 1996, became “TRICARE Designated Providers”—the first DoD-sponsored, <b>full-risk</b> managed health care plan {{and the first to}} serve the military 65 and older population (other than on a limited demonstration basis). The Plan began offering the TRICARE Prime benefit the following year. In 2001, the name was shortened to US Family Health Plan.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} ways in which allocating the risk for {{behavioral}} health care expenses between employers and a managed behavioral health organization affects costs and the use of services. DATA SOURCES: Claims from 87 plans that cover mental health and substance abuse services covering over one million member years in 1996 / 1997. STUDY DESIGN: Multi-part regression models for health care cost are used. Dependent variables are health care costs decomposed into access to any care, costs per user, any inpatient use, costs per outpatient user, and costs per inpatient user. The study compares <b>full-risk</b> plans, in which the managed care organization provides managed care services and acts as the insurer by assuming the risk for claims costs, with contracts in which the managed care organization only manages care (for a fixed administrative fee) and the employer retains the risk for claims. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: <b>Full-risk</b> plans are not statistically significantly different from non-risk plans in terms of any mental health specialty use or hospitalization rates, but costs per user are significantly lower, in particular for inpatients. CONCLUSIONS: Risk contracts do not affect initial access to mental health specialty care or hospitalization rates, but patients in risk contracts have lower costs, either because of lower intensity of care or because they are treated by less expensive providers...|$|E
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Questions about the financial status of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) have increased since the 2005 hurricanes, which left the program with an unprecedented $ 17. 4 billion deficit [...] a debt that resulted in GAO placing NFIP on its high-risk list in March 2006. Among the concerns are the subsidized rates NFIP must provide for about 25 percent of the policies, mostly for older buildings in high-risk flood zones. And although fully risk-based rates are supposed to reflect actual flood risk, concerns have been raised that they do not. This report evaluates (1) the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) process for setting <b>full-risk</b> rates {{to determine whether it}} produces rates that accurately reflect the risk of flooding and (2) the process that FEMA uses to set subsidized rates and their effect on the financial condition of NFIP. To do this work, GAO evaluated the NFIP rate model, examined data from FEMA, surveyed relevant literature, and interviewed other relevant agencies and risk-modeling firms. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of economy, {{the investment of}} municipal road construction project also has a quick growth. Design phase is crucial that determines {{the cost of a}} construction project. Stage of the project cost only ensure the timeliness and accuracy in order to manage the whole process of the project cost in the effective control of project cost of the occurrence, and improve investment returns and social benefits. This paper studies the budget control in design phase of municipal roads. Budget Characteristic of Design Stage of Municipal Administration Road The engineering budget control of design stage of China ’ municipal administration road has four characteristics: whole team, all elements, whole process and <b>full-risk</b> budget management. The management of engineering budget of design stage of municipal administration road construction industry is transformed from design document to entity, which are not only the responsibilities of designing institute and relevant units, but also related to owner, supervising unit, construction unit, and supplier of construction equipment [1]. Firstly, choose designing institute, which is responsible for the construction period and project quality. Meanwhile, construction department is responsible for putting the drawings into practice and completing the design alteration required by projec...|$|E
40|$|The vast {{majority}} of homes and small commercial buildings that are insured against flood damage in the United States are covered by the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which {{is administered by the}} Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the Department of Homeland Security. Although the flood insurance program had been largely self-sustaining in the past, it had to borrow about $ 17 billion from the federal Treasury to pay claims after the catastrophic hurricanes of 2005. That borrowing has highlighted questions about the program’s financial health, including the actuarial soundness of the premium rates charged on policies that are not explicitly subsidized and the cost of paying claims for properties that have suffered multiple flood losses. This Congressional Budget Office (CBO) paper—prepared {{at the request of the}} Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs—explains how FEMA sets “full-risk ” (actuarially based) premium rates for the flood insurance program. The paper then discusses various reasons for concern that those rates may not be adequate to cover the total expected costs associated with the program’s <b>full-risk</b> policies. The report also addresses other aspects of the NFIP, including the impact of insured properties that hav...|$|E
40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) was added to GAO's high-risk list in 2006 and remains high risk due to losses incurred from the 2005 hurricanes and subsequent losses, the financial exposure the program represents for the federal government, and ongoing management and operational challenges. As of July 31, 2013, the program owed approximately $ 24 billion to the U. S. Treasury (Treasury). NFIP's financial condition highlights structural weaknesses in how {{the program has been}} funded [...] primarily its rate structure. The annual amount that NFIP collects in both <b>full-risk</b> and subsidized premiums is generally not enough to cover its operating costs, claim payments, and principal and interest payments for the debt owed to Treasury, especially in years of catastrophic flooding, such as 2005. This arrangement results in much of the financial risk of flooding being transferred to the federal government and ultimately the taxpayer. Furthermore, weaknesses in NFIP management and operations, including financial reporting processes and internal controls, strategic and human capital planning, and oversight of contractors have placed the program at risk. ...|$|E
40|$|KEY QUESTIONS ANSWERED What are {{the best}} ways to {{organize}} payment systems to reward quality care for high-need, high-cost patients? What are the challenges to implementing such a payment system? KEY THEMES AND TAKEAWAYS This resource reviews emerging payer and provider partnerships that incentivize value-based payment models. Key points and recommendations include: The highest-need, highest-cost population is ever-changing. Payment systems should focus on identifying the population that will benefit most from care management services. Models must periodically re-evaluate this population. Provider incentives must be based on Triple Aim outcomes [...] better care for individuals, better health for populations, and lower costs. If per-member-per-month incentive payments are used, there should be metrics that are evaluated to ensure that the Triple Aim is met. Providers face financial "barriers to entry" to make initial programmatic and infrastructure investments. Preventing inappropriate and/or avoidable use of care requires upfront investments such as information technology, social supports, and expansion of primary care services. Programs are most effective when they partner with patients, empowering them to {{take an active role in}} their own care management. A form of sustainable payment is a per-member-per-month care management fee based on Triple Aim outcomes for high-risk patients, plus shared savings. Providers with existing care management programs for high-need, high-cost patients prefer <b>full-risk</b> capitation payments...|$|E
40|$|In March 2014, Congress passed {{legislation}} to halt discounted flood insurance premiums from increasing to <b>full-risk</b> levels. The rate hike was authorized {{two years earlier}} by the Biggert-Waters Act to address the National Flood Insurance Program’s structurally induced $ 24 billion debt. The recent developments highlight the tension between risk-based premium and affordability of flood insurance for homeowners in flood-prone areas. This study seeks {{to understand how the}} tension can be resolved using a voucher program coupled with required mitigation in Charleston County, South Carolina. It specifically focuses on home elevation as the mitigation method. Compared to a simply insurance voucher program, the program can cut government expenditure on flood insurance vouchers by more than half when mitigation costs around $ 25, 000 and policies are located in high hazard flood zones. In the most hazardous flood zones (V Zone), cost saving is achievable even when elevation costs as much as $ 75, 000. Lastly, we found several conditions under which mitigation does not lead to reductions in voucher cost, such as when policyholder’s household income is below $ 10, 000 or when elevation cost is high. Under such scenarios, insurance voucher for risk-based premium is still preferable to discounted premiums...|$|E
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agency that administers the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), estimates that subsidized properties [...] those that receive discounted premium rates that do not fully reflect the properties' actual flood risk [...] experience as much as five times the flood damage as properties that do not qualify for subsidized rates. Almost one in every four residential policies has subsidized rates that are on average 35 - 40 percent of the <b>full-risk</b> rate. Unprecedented losses from the 2005 hurricane season and NFIP's periodic need to borrow from the Department of the Treasury to pay flood insurance claims has raised concerns about the impact that subsidized premium rates have on the longterm financial solvency of NFIP. GAO designated NFIP as high-risk in March 2006; as of June 2008, NFIP's debt stood at $ 17. 4 billion. This report (1) provides information on NFIP's inventory of subsidized properties and (2) examines NFIP's current approach to subsidized properties and {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of options for reducing the costs associated with these properties. To do this work, GAO analyzed data on policies and claims and collected available data about subsidized properties. GAO also reviewed applicable reports and interviewed relevant agency, state, and private sector officials. In its written comments, DHS expounded upon several topics discussed in this report. ...|$|E
