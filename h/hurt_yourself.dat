25|$|In 1968, Callas told Lord Harewood, De Hildalgo had {{the real}} great {{training}}, {{maybe even the}} last real training of the real bel canto. As a young girl—thirteen years old—I was immediately thrown into her arms, meaning that I learned the secrets, the ways of this bel canto, which of course as you well know, is not just beautiful singing. It is a very hard training; it {{is a sort of}} a strait-jacket that you're supposed to put on, {{whether you like it or}} not. You have to learn to read, to write, to form your sentences, how far you can go, fall, <b>hurt</b> <b>yourself,</b> put yourself back on your feet continuously. De Hidalgo had one method, which was the real bel canto way, where no matter how heavy a voice, it should always be kept light, it should always be worked on in a flexible way, never to weigh it down. It is a method of keeping the voice light and flexible and pushing the instrument into a certain zone where it might not be too large in sound, but penetrating. And teaching the scales, trills, all the bel canto embellishments, which is a whole vast language of its own.|$|E

500|$|In 1934, Birkett {{acted as}} {{counsel for the}} second of the two Brighton trunk murders, a case which was {{described}} as [...] "his greatest triumph in a capital case". In June 1934, a woman's torso was found in a suitcase in Brighton railway station. The legs were discovered at King's Cross station the next day, but her head and arms were never found, and the case is still unsolved. A woman by the name of Violette Kaye had disappeared, and the appearance of the first woman's body prompted greater scrutiny on Kaye's case. On 14 July, they interviewed Toni Mancini, Kaye's boyfriend, who convinced them that the dead woman could not possibly be Kaye; the dead woman had been identified as around thirty five years old and five months pregnant, while Kaye was ten years older. Kaye was last seen alive on 10 May looking distressed in the doorway to her house and had been scheduled to visit her sister in London who received a telegram on 11 May reading [...] "Going abroad. Good job. Sail Sunday. Will write. Vi." [...] in block capitals. The post office clerks could not remember who sent it, but experts testified that the handwriting on the telegram had similarities to that on a menu written by Mancini. On 14 May, with the help of another man, Mancini moved his belongings from the house he shared with Kaye, which included a large trunk which was too heavy to move by hand. Mancini had told people that he had broken up with Kaye and she had moved to Paris, and that before she left he had beaten her. He later said to a friend, [...] "What is the good of knocking a woman about with your fists? You only <b>hurt</b> <b>yourself.</b> You should hit her with a hammer same as I did and [...] her up." [...] A hammerhead was later found in the rubbish at his old house.|$|E

If it were not exactly that, to restless intellects, it at least comprised as much accommodation as any person, not sanguine to insanity, could have looked for in a room of its dimensions. For only keep the bedstead always in your mind; and you were safe. That was the grand secret.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients {{with serious}} medical illnesses, such as cancer, are at {{increased}} risk of suicide but are also often facing death. The Patient Health Questionnaire- 9 (PHQ- 9) is widely used to screen patients for depression. It includes an item that asks about thoughts of death and <b>hurting</b> <b>yourself</b> (Item- 9). OBJECTIVE: To describe the nature of thoughts of death and suicide reported in clinical interviews carried out to further assess suicidal ideation of cancer outpatients who had endorsed the "suicidal thoughts item" (Item- 9) of the PHQ- 9 during routine depression screening. METHOD: Secondary analysis of anonymized service data (with ethical approval) derived from the routine clinical administration of self-report questionnaires and telephone interviews to outpatients attending a Cancer Centre in the UK. RESULTS: Complete data were available on 330 / 463 (71 %) of patients who had endorsed Item- 9. In a subsequent structured telephone interview, approximately one-third of these patients denied any thoughts that they would be better off dead, another third acknowledged having thoughts that they would be better off dead, but not of suicide, and the remaining third reported clear thoughts of committing suicide. CONCLUSION: Only one-third of cancer outpatients who endorse the "suicidal thoughts item" of the PHQ- 9 report suicidal thoughts at a subsequent interview. Services planning to set up depression screening with the PHQ- 9 need to carefully consider the relative benefits and burden to their service and patients of including Item- 9 and interviewing all those who endorse it...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine whether a history of school bullying victimization is associated with suicidal ideation in adult life. A random and representative sample of 2907 South Australian adults was surveyed in Autumn, 2008. Respondents were asked "When you were at school, did you experience traumatic bullying by peers that was particularly severe, for example, being frequently targeted or routinely harassed in any way by 'bullies'?" Depression was determined by the mood module of the PRIME-MD which includes a suicidal ideation question; "In the last 2 weeks, have you had thoughts that you would be better off dead or <b>hurting</b> <b>yourself</b> in some way?" The overall prevalence of suicidal ideation in postschool age respondents was 3. 4 % (95 % confidence interval: 2. 8 %- 4. 2 %) in 2008. Bullying by peers was recalled by 18. 7 % (17. 2 %- 20. 3 %). Respondents with a history of being bullied were approximately 3 times (odds ratio: 3. 2) more likely to report suicidal ideation compared with those who did not. The association between being bullied and suicidal ideation remained after controlling for both depression and sociodemographic variables (odds ratio: 2. 1). The results from the present research suggest that there is a strong association between a history of childhood bullying victimization and current suicidal ideation that persists across all ages. Bullying prevention programs in schools could hold the potential for longer lasting benefits in this important area of public health. Leigh Roeger, Stephen Allison, Rebecca Korossy–Horwood, Kerena A.

60|$|Such are {{the written}} {{placards}} wafered {{up in the}} gentlemen’s dressing-room, or the green-room (where there is any), at a private theatre; and such are the sums extracted from the shop-till, or overcharged in the office expenditure, by the donkeys who are prevailed upon to pay for permission to exhibit their lamentable ignorance and boobyism {{on the stage of}} a private theatre. This they do, in proportion to the scope afforded by the character for the display of their imbecility. For instance, the Duke of Glo’ster is well worth two pounds, because he has it all to himself; he must wear a real sword, and what is better still, he must draw it, several times {{in the course of the}} piece. The soliloquies alone are well worth fifteen shillings; then there is the stabbing King Henry—decidedly cheap at three-and-sixpence, that’s eighteen-and-sixpence; bullying the coffin-bearers—say eighteen-pence, though it’s worth much more—that’s a pound. Then the love scene with Lady Ann, and the bustle of the fourth act can’t be dear at ten shillings more—that’s only one pound ten, including the ‘off with his head!’—which is sure to bring down the applause, and it is very easy to do—‘Orf with his ed’ (very quick and loud;—then slow and sneeringly)—‘So much for Bu-u-u-uckingham!’ Lay the emphasis on the ’uck;’ get yourself gradually into a corner, and work with your right hand, while you’re saying it, as if you were feeling your way, and it’s sure to do. The tent scene is confessedly worth half-a-sovereign, and so you have the fight in, gratis, and everybody knows what an effect may be produced by a good combat. One—two—three—four—over; then, one—two—three—four—under; then thrust; then dodge and slide about; then fall down on one knee; then fight upon it, and then get up again and stagger. You may keep on doing this, as long as it seems to take—say ten minutes—and then fall down (backwards, if you can manage it without <b>hurting</b> <b>yourself),</b> and die game: nothing like it for producing an effect. They always do it at Astley’s and Sadler’s Wells, and if they don’t know how to do this sort of thing, who in the world does? A small child, or a female in white, increases the interest of a combat materially—indeed, we are not aware that a regular legitimate terrific broadsword combat could be done without; but it would be rather difficult, and somewhat unusual, to introduce this effect in the last scene of Richard the Third, so the only thing to be done, is, just to make the best of a bad bargain, and be as long as possible fighting it out.|$|R
40|$|Background One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} in suicide prevention is that it cannot be predicted. Significant number of patients attempt suicide while being under psychiatric treatment. Lethality and intent of each risk factor varies and remains inconsistent. Though structured instruments have also been useful with limited success search for newer methods remains an urgent clinical need. We believe risk is multifactorial and a scale based upon fundamental domains of biological, psychological, social, environmental, spiritual and clinical origin can elucidate more specific factors. Scale for impact of suicidality- Management, Assessment 2 ̆ 6 Planning of care-brief screener (SISMAP-bcs) is 23 item scale which is valid, reliable and easy to administer. In this study {{we are trying to}} examine significant risk factors for suicide based upon findings of this scale. Method This is open level, naturalistic study. Consenting psychiatric patients from out patient and in-patient facility of a tertiary psychiatric hospital were recruited. All patients were assessed on of clinical, phenomenological and psychopathological parameters using standard psychometric tools and SIS-MAP brief screener was used for assessment of suicide-related variables. We completed assessment of 79 patients, in this sample 37 were males. mean age was 38. 26 (SD 14. 78, range 19 - 75). 44 patients were hospitalized and 35 were on outpatient treatment. The score of SISMAP cut-off score is 6 for outpatient treatment, 7 and 8 for decision based upon clinical judgment and 9 and above for hospitalization. A score of 8 and above was suggestive of high risk. Out findings suggest significant factors for suicide. 1) Shorter duration of illness (r= 0. 0334, p 3 ̆c 0. 05) 2) Severity of depressive symptoms (r= 0. 62, p 3 ̆c 0. 001) 3) severity of psychotic symptoms (r= 0. 413, p= 0. 014). 4) Being single (f= 3. 071, p= 0. 042). 5) Suicide being reason for admission (f= 4. 238, p= 0. 008). 6) History of physical assault (f= 5. 078, p= 0. 031) and 7) Interpersonal problem in family (f= 7. 931, p= 0. 008). The scale also identified the questions, which were most significant. Few such questions are 1) is your family supportive of your problem? 2) When you have thoughts about <b>hurting</b> <b>yourself</b> or about death, 3) can you control these thoughts? 4) Do you savor your lifesatisfying moments? 5) Do you find it difficult to know where to find/access health care services? 6) Do you ever feel like there is no meaning or purpose in your life? Conclusion The The study shows that some of the clinically relevant factors which were indicative of high suicidality. The study also identifies significant risk factors associated with high risk of suicide. We conclude that a number of clinical factors, which suggest high risk, can be captured by multidimensional assessment scale in routine clinical work. The future research may suggest lethality of combination...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundThere {{is concern}} over the {{potential}} impact of the Internet on self-harm and suicidal behaviour, particularly in young people. However, {{little is known about the}} prevalence and patterns of suicide/self-harm related Internet use in the general population. MethodsCross sectional study of 3946 of the 8525 participants in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) who were sent a self-report questionnaire including questions on suicide/self-harm related Internet use and self-harm history at age 21 years. ResultsSuicide/self-harm related Internet use was reported by 22. 5 % (886 / 3946) of participants; 11. 9 % (470 / 3946) had come across sites/chatrooms discussing self-harm or suicide, 8. 2 % (323 / 3946) had searched for information about self-harm, 7. 5 % (296 / 3946) had searched for information about suicide and 9. 1 % (357 / 3946) had used the Internet to discuss self-harm or suicidal feelings. Suicide/self-harm related Internet use was particularly prevalent amongst those who had harmed with suicidal intent (70 %, 174 / 248), and was strongly associated with the presence of suicidal thoughts, suicidal plans, and history of self-harm. Sites offering help, advice, or support were accessed by a larger proportion of the sample (8. 2 %, 323 / 3946) than sites offering information on how to <b>hurt</b> or kill <b>yourself</b> (3. 1 %, 123 / 3946). Most individuals (81 %) who had accessed these potentially harmful sites had also accessed help sites. Limitations(i) There were differences between questionnaire responders and non-responders which could lead to selection bias and (ii) the data were cross-sectional, and we cannot conclude that associations are causal. ConclusionsSuicide/self-harm related Internet use is common amongst young adults, particularly amongst those with suicidal thoughts and behaviour. Both harmful and helpful sites were accessed, highlighting that the Internet presents potential risks but also offers opportunities for suicide prevention...|$|R
