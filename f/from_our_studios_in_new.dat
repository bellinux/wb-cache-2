40|$|We {{have been}} {{generally}} successful for transferring software engineering knowledge to industry through {{various forms of}} education. However, many challenges in software engineering training remain. A key amongst these is how best to energise software engineering education with real-world software engineering practices. This paper describes our experience of delivering a radically different approach based {{on the notion of}} a Software Design Studio. The Software Design Studio is both a lab for students engaged in conceiving, designing and developing software products as well as an approach for teaching software engineering in the lab which emphasizes practical hands-on work and experimentation. The feedback on the Software Design Studio – from both staff and students – has been outstanding. Although the programme is designed as a small, elite programme there is interest to see if the teaching methods can be transferred across to the much larger undergraduate programme in Computer Science. In this paper, we provide a detailed description of how <b>our</b> <b>studio</b> works <b>in</b> practice so that others, thinking of taking a studio or studio-inspired approach, can use in designing their own courses...|$|R

5000|$|According to the band, the EP is a {{collection}} of our more 'settled' numbers.

Where in the past we've crowbarred-in every single dynamic, idea and style we could think of into a record, we thought it best this time to present a more thematic and cohesive collection, so's not to disrupt the more fainted-hearted listener from their blub-induced slumber. Still, it covers plenty of ground, and features a fair few Oceansize firsts such as trumpets, pedal-steel guitar as well as a bit of pumping techno and some additional vocals from Kate Ray.

It’s always been my belief that, once the people who work here believed in their own greatness, there was virtually nothing we couldn’t accomplish. And they have proven me right time and time again.

40|$|This paper {{contains}} some observations which derive <b>from</b> <b>our</b> work as <b>Studio</b> Professors. <b>In</b> the last years, <b>studios</b> are <b>in</b> a transition phase with the progressive introduction of computers in later {{stages of the}} design process. The initiative generally belongs to students rather than to studio masters, since the former are aware that a knowledge of CAD systems will make them able to get work in architects offices. It is the first few Studios that will guide the student in forming a conception of what is architecture. Therefore, we have observer more attentively {{the way in which}} he establishes his first competence as a designer. We believe it is useful to clarify design training before we can integrate computers into it. The ways we all learn to design and which we transmit <b>in</b> the <b>Studio</b> were obviously created a long time ago, when Architecture became a subject taught in Schools, no longer a craft to be acquired under a master. The conception of architecture that the student forms in his mind is largely dependent on a long tradition of Beaux-Arts training which survives (under different forms) in Modern Architecture. The methods he or she acquires will become the basis of his creative design process also in professional life. Computer programmes are designed to adapt into the stages of this design process simply as time saving tools. We are interested in finding out how they can become an active part in the creative process and how to control this integration in teaching. Therefore, our work deals mainly with the tradition of the Studio and the conditioning it produces. The next step will be to explore the possiblities and restrictions that will inevitably issue from the introduction of new media...|$|R
