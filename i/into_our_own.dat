500|$|The {{season finale}} {{of the second}} season {{introduced}} the parallel universe to viewers. Fringes producers debated over {{how much of this}} universe to depict in the third season, but ultimately decided that showing the doppelgangers would [...] "fit more <b>into</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> character’s lives and show different aspects of their personalities". As a result, Fringe began its third season by alternating between episodes, with each depicting one universe. The Fox network was initially resistant to this design, as executives were [...] "really concerned that if the episodes didn't have [...] Walter or Peter in them, it wouldn’t feel like our show anymore." [...] Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman explained that the series had to constantly evolve, [...] "otherwise we’ll get bored, the cast will get bored, the audience will get bored"; after the first several episodes of the season, Fox agreed it was a positive change.|$|E

500|$|The ONA {{promotes}} {{the idea that}} human history {{can be divided into}} a series of Aeons, each of which contain a corresponding human civilization. It expresses the view that the current Aeonic civilization is that of the Western, but claims that the evolution of this society is threatened by the [...] "Magian/Nazarene" [...] influence of Judeo-Christian religion, which the Order seeks to combat in order to establish a militaristic new social order, termed the [...] "Imperium". According to Order teachings, this is necessary in order for a Galactic civilization to form, in which [...] "Aryan" [...] society will colonise the Milky Way. It advocates a spiritual path in which the practitioner is required to break societal taboos by isolating themselves from society, committing crimes, embracing political extremism and violence, and carrying out an act of human sacrifice. ONA members practice magick, believing that they are able to do so through channeling energies <b>into</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> [...] "causal" [...] realm from an [...] "acausal" [...] realm where the laws of physics do not apply, with such magical actions designed to aid in the ultimate establishment of the Imperium.|$|E

Two Maxim-Nordenfeld guns, whose efficiency had been painfully evident during the action, were a welcome addition to our artillery. Two hundred and fifty Boers were killed and wounded and about two hundred taken prisoners, the loss falling most heavily upon the Johannesburgers, the Germans, and the Hollanders. General Koch, Dr. Coster, Colonel Schiel, Pretorius, and other well-known Transvaalers fell <b>into</b> <b>our</b> hands. <b>Our</b> <b>own</b> casualty list consisted of 41 killed and 220 wounded, much the same number as at Talana Hill, the heaviest losses falling upon the Gordon Highlanders and the Imperial Light Horse.|$|R

2500|$|Most Reconstructionists do {{not believe}} in revelation (the idea that God reveals his will to human beings). This is {{dismissed}} as supernaturalism.

2500|$|In April, Portadown loyalists {{threatened}} to picket St John's Catholic Church {{at the top}} of Garvaghy Road. On 29 May a [...] "junior" [...] Orange march passed near Garvaghy Road. There were clashes following the march with 13 police officers and four civilians hurt. The police fired 50 plastic bullets during the clashes.

2500|$|Modern {{historians have}} {{constructed}} a myth presenting this victory as having saved Christian Europe from the Muslims. Edward Gibbon, for example, called Charles Martel {{the savior of}} Christendom and the battle near Poitiers an encounter that changed {{the history of the}} world. ... This myth has survived well <b>into</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> times. ... Contemporaries of the battle, however, did not overstate its significance. The continuators of Fredegar's chronicle, who probably wrote in the mid-eighth century, pictured the battle as just one of many military encounters between Christians and Saracens – moreover, as only one in a series of wars fought by Frankish princes for booty and territory. ... One of Fredegar's continuators presented the battle of Poitiers as what it really was: an episode in the struggle between Christian princes as the Carolingians strove to bring Aquitaine under their rule.|$|E

40|$|The piano accompaniments Robert Schumann {{wrote for}} J. S. Bach's solo violin works {{can be read}} as a {{commentary}} by one major composer on another's works. These accompaniments misread Bach's intentions in obvious ways (e. g., that solo violin is not a viable performance vehicle), and interpret rhythmic, harmonic, thematic/motivic, and formal structures in a manner clearly at odds with early eighteenth-century conceptions. Comparing these works with Schumann's accompaniments, eighteenth century arrangements of some movements (including some by Bach), and keeping in mind the theoretical frameworks of various eras allows us to gain insights <b>into</b> how <b>our</b> <b>own</b> stylistic biases affect what we hear in music of past eras...|$|R

40|$|Background: Colorectal {{cancer is}} one of the most fre-quently {{observed}} neoplasms in the world. It develops from intraepithelial neoplasia of the colorectal mucosa, and these precursor lesions are also known as adenoma. As the precursor lesion is known and can be detected easily, efficient screening strategies are available for a reliable prevention of colorectal adenocarcinoma, e. g. by colonoscopy. Methods: Literature databases (PubMed) were searched selectively for the keywords ‘colorectal adenoma’, ‘epidemiology’, and ‘resection techniques’. The results are presented in the following text, also tak-ing <b>into</b> account <b>our</b> <b>own</b> experience and the current S 3 guidelines.
