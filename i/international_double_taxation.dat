40|$|In {{this article}} we sought to address the <b>international</b> <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> {{phenomenon}} from two different standpoints. To begin with, {{in the first part}} we analysed the framework of <b>international</b> <b>double</b> <b>taxation,</b> and how this topic was tackled in both Romanian and international literature. <b>International</b> <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> has been analyzed, mutatis mutandis, from an economic perspective, more precisely in terms of the implications that it generates on economies, on added value, on capital flows, on the internationalisation of business. Second, I believed it was important to analyse <b>international</b> <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> from a legal perspective, through the jurisdictional effects of obtaining income or holding property at the European or international level. Romania's case is carefully approached in this paper, aiming to highlight the issues Romania is facing concerning cooperation in tax matters with authorities from other countries, how the more than 80 double taxation conventions are applied and interpreted, but also other aspects that should be considered by the Romanian tax authorities, based on the provisions of the Fiscal Code and the Fiscal Procedure Code. The article ends by presenting, commenting on and analysing two test cases in <b>international</b> <b>double</b> <b>taxation,</b> of remarkable importance and actuality for Romanian jurisprudence to observe how complex double taxation mechanisms operate in practice. The conclusion of this article emphasises the importance ofsignificant “steps” achieved by Romania on the path to creating a true “fiscal area” in the European Union, as well as the “corridors” that should be inserted to correct economi c – legal and economic deficiencies and gaps, in order to strengthen the fiscal area. ...|$|E

The analysis included 162 countries and jurisdictions with which investments transactions were closed that originated or were received in Brazil, between 2005 and 2011. The panel data analysis technique was applied through the selection of six independent variables, in order to verify the behavior of the <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> treaties in view of the investments. Through the estimated model, it was verified that these treaties had a positive and statistically significant impact – when compared to earlier studies – on the direct foreign investment volume. When dividing the sample between the investments received and made in Brazil, a greater increase was identified in the direct foreign investments received (130. 1 %) than in the investments made (76. 9 %), although this was the variable with the second largest positive impact in the model. In conclusion, exclusively in the Brazilian context, the <b>international</b> <b>double</b> income <b>taxation</b> is a relevant factor in the investment decision, as the presence of treaties to guarantee the investors in the receipt of revenues without <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> substantially increases the investment flow.

Rather, it would appear to emerge as the outcome of the different roles taken on by the German institutions with relevance in international tax policy, such as the legislator, tax administration, and national courts.

40|$|The article {{analyses}} {{the current}} “state of the art” {{of the tax}} harmonization across the European Union, and the {{attention is focused on}} the three most important drivers of this evolution o the national taxation systems of the Member states. The first one is the Treaty and the fundamental freedoms enshrined in it. In particular, the author emphasises the importance of the freedom of establishment and the free movement of capitals as provisions adequate to prevent <b>international</b> <b>double</b> <b>taxations</b> or an overall unfair taxation in one state of the Union or in another. The second one is the contribute of the European Court of Justice which stretched to the very limits the interpretation of the fundamental rights in order to cover the possible loopholes of positive EU law on Direct taxation. In other words, where a specific competence of European Union to legislate on tax matters is missing, then the same result could be possibly obtained interpreting the mentioned above basic rules of the Treaty. The third one is formed by the few directives on Direct taxation which have been passed by the Council in the last decades and covering mainly the so called passive income (interests, royalties and dividends) considered as a sort of priority in the Union policy. The reason justifying this intervention {{can be found in the}} fact that these very income are the most influenced by the not complete harmonization of the Treaty and the ones which more than any others are feasible to be produced in a cross border context. While labour income, for instance, is generally produced by workers in the states where they also resides, with some remarkable exceptions, it is quite common for a company to have non resident shareholders, or to have a loan from a non resident corporation or bank.

40|$|While {{there is}} a {{well-established}} body of empirical research documenting the negative effect of taxation on foreign direct investment (FDI), there is scant evidence {{on the extent to}} which <b>international</b> tax considerations (<b>double</b> <b>taxation,</b> <b>international</b> tax relief stipulated in bilateral tax treaties and the effect of withholding taxes) affect the role of taxation for FDI, and how tax issues differ according to the investment strategies—‘horizontal’ and ‘vertical’—pursued by %multinational firms. This paper addresses these issues. Using data on US acquisitions over the period 1995 - 2005 in 18 OECD countries, it is shown that international tax relief plays a critical role in determining the impact of taxation. Regardless of the type of investment strategy, the significantly negative effect of corporate taxes disappears when accounting for the tax credits stipulated in bilateral tax treaties. It is also shown that there is considerable heterogeneity of the impact of sales taxes across investment strategies. High administrative burden to comply with taxation always reduces a country’s appeal as target for FDI. Corporate taxation; Cross-Border acquisitions; FDI strategies; Tax treaties; Tax credits...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Taxation)) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Commerce, Law and Management, School of Accountancy, 2014. With the {{international}} platform for cross border investment {{and economic development}} growing year on year at a steady pace, it has become apparent that bilateral income tax treaties do not always operate effectively in multilateral tax situations. Global transactions involving more than two states are certainly not uncommon {{and it could be}} said that the most fundamental issue in <b>international</b> <b>taxation</b> is <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> resulting from the taxing rights of different tax jurisdictions that ‘overlap’ with regard to, generally speaking, one taxpayer or one declared income stream. Multilateral tax situations, commonly known as triangular cases, occur where tax incidence on a particular stream of income is triggered in three countries. These situations typically arise where a person who is a tax resident in two respective countries for tax purposes (a dual resident), or a person who is a tax resident in one country and has a permanent establishment in another, is earning revenue of which the source is in a third country. Taxing rights and jurisdictions of the three countries involved could potentially be in conflict with each other and therefore such situations may bring about lawful <b>international</b> triangular <b>taxation</b> or <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> which will inevitably discourage enterprises from continuing investment and development internationally. Broad multilateral treaties in the income tax arena are not common 1, and most treaties are still of a bilateral nature, i. e. generally addressing tax scenarios where only two specific countries are involved. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (’the OECD’) Model Tax Convention states this: There are no reasons to believe that the conclusion of a multilateral tax convention involving all Member countries could now be considered practicable. The Committee therefore considers that bilateral conventions are still a more appropriate way to ensure the elimination of <b>double</b> <b>taxation</b> at the <b>international</b> level. ...|$|R
