500|$|Issued by Apple Records in the United States in October 1971, [...] "Imagine" [...] {{became the}} best-selling single of Lennon's solo career. It peaked at number {{three on the}} Billboard Hot 100 and reached number one in Canada on the RPM {{national}} singles chart, remaining there for two weeks. Upon its release the song's lyrics upset some religious groups, particularly the line: [...] "Imagine there's no heaven". When asked about the song {{during one of his}} final interviews, Lennon said he considered it to be as strong a composition as any he had written with the Beatles. He described the song's meaning and explicated its commercial appeal: [...] "Anti-religious, anti-nationalistic, anti-conventional, anti-capitalistic, but because it is sugarcoated it is accepted ... Now <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have to do. Put your political message across with a little honey." [...] In an open letter to Paul McCartney published in Melody Maker, Lennon said that [...] "Imagine" [...] was [...] "'Working Class Hero' with sugar on it for conservatives like yourself". On 30 November 1971, the Imagine LP reached number one on the UK chart. It became the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed album of Lennon's solo career.|$|E

[...] "As <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> said just now, there is a law, after all, that will protect me in the {{possession}} of my little girl. I don't care what it costs; I want that law." ...|$|R
60|$|BRIDGET. <b>I</b> don't <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are saying. [Looks out.] There is a {{crowd of}} people talking to your pupils.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I don't {{know that}} I mean that," [...] Alice said carelessly; [...] "but I {{do not always}} <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean, though <b>I</b> always <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And yet--if <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are {{referring}} to--you wish {{to speak}} to me about something which is only interesting to myself and my most intimate friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can she now? <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean, but I don't {{believe a}} word of it. The bishop manages his own affairs himself, quite {{as much as you}} do, or Mr. Harold Smith." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean, Pigeon. Well, home we mean to go, {{before the}} winter sets in, and when matters {{have a little}} settled down between the English and Yankees. It isn't safe travelling, just now, in Michigan--you must own that, yourself, my good fellow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] said Miss Lillycrop, {{with a mild}} smile, [...] "you will {{no doubt}} wonder at my ignorance, but <b>I</b> don't <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean by a battery-jar." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think <b>I</b> now <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean," [...] <b>I</b> answered, [...] "and can {{comprehend}} why {{you should}} occasionally prefer the twilight of illusion to the steady light of reason." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, that's simple enough. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> exactly <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean. Well, if ever {{it becomes}} less difficult, {{remember}} that I should {{always like to}} know. It seemed a little--personal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you leave}} out the poems," [...] said Dorothea. [...] "I think they are wanted to {{complete}} the poet. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean about knowledge passing into feeling, for {{that seems to be}} just what I experience. But I am sure I could never produce a poem." ...|$|E
60|$|RIDGEON. I know that. Well, I {{am going}} to test you--hard.

6000|$|... "I {{wonder why}} they made you the Newdigate poet at Oxford, Sholto: you mix your metaphors most dreadfully. Dont be angry with me: <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean; and I am very sorry. I say flippant things because I must. How can one meet {{seriousness}} in modern society except by chaff?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Right,' he answered, {{throwing}} them into my lap. 'Three of them, {{and not a}} woman's hand among them. Sink me, if <b>I</b> can <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have been doing all your life.|$|R

But you--you that ken all this to be true, which I must take on your word--you that, if <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> said e'en now, promised her shelter and {{protection}} in her travail, why do not you step forward, and bear leal and soothfast evidence in her behalf, as ye may with a clear conscience?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I fancy <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean, my dear boy," [...] I said, and in {{the right}} of my ten years' {{seniority}} I put my hand caressingly on his shoulder, [...] "and you are no more guilty than I am in knowing that if Mrs. Bentley {{were not in the}} way there would be no obstacle to your happiness." ...|$|E

Do you know, Mrs. Allan, I'm so thankful for friendship. It beautifies life so much." ...|$|E
6000|$|Wetherford {{caught him}} up. [...] "I reckon <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean. You {{consider}} Lize and me undersirable parents--not {{just the kind}} you'd {{cut out of the}} herd of your own free will. Well, that's all right, I don't blame you so far as I'm concerned. But you can forget me, consider me a dead one. I'll never bother her nor you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he observed, {{addressing}} Batley, [...] "you {{have the}} courage of your convictions if you have offered to maintain them against all comers, which <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> is <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> could <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> say, {{things would}} be all right," [...] Joe said, with a laugh, and then, as he emerged from the shadows cast by the {{overhead}} railway structure, he {{came face to face}} with Master Plummer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pleasanter for you, I am afraid," [...] murmured Hallward, regretfully. [...] "And now good-bye. I {{am sorry}} you won't {{let me look}} at the picture once again. But that can't be helped. <b>I</b> quite <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> feel about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am my own master, Ruth," [...] he said; [...] "I have no {{one else}} to please or to consider. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have just told me, but if I gave you my word that I would try and be to you what Isaac might have been if he had not been led away by these strange ideas, wouldn't you trust me, Ruth?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... . I don't think <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean by [...] "the {{healthier}} people are, {{the more}} repulsive {{they seem to}} be"; one must be healthy to be perfect, must n't one? I don't like unhealthy people. I had to play on that wretched piano after reading your letter; {{it made me feel}} unhappy. I've been having a splendid lot of tennis lately, got the back-handed lifting stroke at last--hurrah! [...] .|$|E
6000|$|Desmond made {{a little}} {{restraining}} gesture. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "it's not my business, but I think <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are referring to--and, perhaps, it's scarcely wise to be too sure. With all deference to Mrs. Ratcliffe I can't help fancying you are well out of the other matter. After all, to mention no other reason, it would require {{a certain amount of}} courage to recognize that lady as one's mother-in-law." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How do you mean, sir?" [...] {{the judge}} asked. [...] "I don't {{want to know}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are {{unanimous}} about, but <b>I</b> don't <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean about being unanimous about {{one part of the}} verdict and not unanimous on the other." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I suppose no {{one ever}} had {{occasion}} to think you too diffident, or too delicate,' Louisa answered him composedly: 'I have never made that objection to you, either as a child or as a woman. <b>I</b> don't <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> would have.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is too severe, René," [...] a {{young man}} who had joined the studio but three months before, expostulated. [...] "She seemed to me a charming young woman. <b>I</b> cannot <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> and Cuthbert are talking of her in this way for." ...|$|R
6000|$|L. Mind, I {{say your}} 'feelings,' not your 'belief.' For I cannot {{undertake}} to explain anybody's beliefs.

(Approving murmurs from audience.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> would say, mein Herr," [...] she said; [...] "the world {{believes}} us to {{be without}} feeling and without hope. We are what we seem {{in the eyes of}} others because the law makes it so, but we are in our hearts like all around us, Herr Châtelain--with this difference, that, feeling our abasement among men, we lean more closely and more affectionately on God. You may condemn us to do your offices and to bear your dislike, but you cannot rob us of our trust in the justice of heaven. In that, at least, we are the equals of the proudest baron in the cantons!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Very well," [...] he said. [...] "You {{have come}} to deliver an ultimatum, and I have {{received}} it. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> perfectly <b>what</b> <b>you</b> will accept {{as an act of}} war. There is nothing more to be said, I think?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Excuse me, Mr. Pendril," [...] {{interposed}} Norah; [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>understand,</b> from <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{have just}} said, that {{our house and}} everything in it belongs to--?" [...] She stopped, as if the mere utterance of the man's name was abhorrent to her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dad, do you {{remember}} my saying once that <b>I</b> didn't <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> and my mother felt for each other?"
