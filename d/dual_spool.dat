40|$|Single-rotation propfan-powered {{regional}} transport aircraft were studied to identify key technology development issues and programs. The need for improved thrust {{specific fuel consumption}} to reduce fuel burned and aircraft direct operating cost is the dominant factor. Typical cycle trends for minimizing fuel consumption are reviewed, and two 10, 000 shp class engine configurations for propfan propulsion systems for the 1990 's are presented. Recommended engine configurations are both three-spool design with <b>dual</b> <b>spool</b> compressors and free power turbines. The benefits of these new propulsion system concepts were evaluated using an advanced airframe, and results are compared for single-rotation propfan and turbofan advanced technology propulsion systems. The single-rotation gearbox is compared to a similar design with current technology to establish {{the benefits of the}} advanced gearbox technology. The conceptual design of the advanced pitch change mechanism identified a high pressure hydraulic system that is superior to the other contenders and completely external to the gearboxes...|$|E

Switch-mode hydraulic circuits, analogous to switch-mode power electronics, provide {{variable power control}} topologies that rely on switching between efficient on and off states. A challenge in realizing these circuits {{is the need for}} a high-speed valve with fast transition time and high switching frequency. The work presented includes the design and modeling of a suitable valve and experimental demonstration of the prototype in a pressure boost converter. The valve architecture consists of a <b>dual</b> <b>spool</b> design actuated by a crank-slider mechanism. The valve design constraints included a switching frequency up to 120 Hz, a transition ratio of 5 % of the cycle period, and a flow rate of 22. 8 lpm at a 0. 6 MPa pressure drop. The valve prototype was validated with experimental demonstration in a pressure boost converter accomplishing boost ratios between 1. 08 - 2. 06. This high-speed valve enables switch-mode circuit studies that can improve efficiency in future work...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{performance}} and operating characteristics of 5 kW-class solid oxide fuel cell and gas turbine (SOFC/GT) hybrid systems for two different configura-tions, namely single- and dual- spool gas turbines. Both single and <b>dual</b> <b>spool</b> turbo-chargers are widely used in the gas turbine industry. Even though their operation {{is based on the}} same physical principles, their performance characteristics and operation parameters vary considerably due to different designs. The implications of the differences on the performance of the hybrid SOFC/GT have not been discussed in literature, and will be the topic of this paper. Operating envelops of single and dual shaft systems are identified and compared. Performance in terms of system efficiency and load following is analyzed. Sensitivities of key variables such as power, SOFC temperature, and GT shaft speed to the control inputs (namely, fuel flow, SOFC current, generator load) are charac-terized, all in an attempt to gain insights on the design implication for the single and dual shaft SOFC/GT systems. Dynamic analysis are also performed for part load operation and load transitions, which shed lights for the development of safe and optimal control strategies. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4004471]...|$|E
40|$|The core noise {{components}} of a <b>dual</b> <b>spool</b> turbofan engine (Honeywell TECH 977) were separated {{by the use of}} a coherence function. A source location technique based on adjusting the time delay between the combustor pressure sensor signal and the far-field microphone signal to maximize the coherence and remove as much variation of the phase angle with frequency as possible was used. While adjusting the time delay to maximize the coherence and minimize the cross spectrum phase angle variation with frequency, the discovery was made that for the 130 microphone a 90. 027 ms time shift worked best for the frequency band from 0 to 200 Hz while a 86. 975 ms time shift worked best for the frequency band from 200 to 400 Hz. Since the 0 to 200 Hz band signal took more time to travel the same distance, it is slower than the 200 to 400 Hz band signal. This suggests the 0 to 200 Hz coherent cross spectral density band is partly due to indirect combustion noise attributed to hot spots interacting with the turbine. The signal in the 200 to 400 Hz frequency band is attributed mostly to direct combustion noise...|$|E
40|$|An {{overview}} of the operation of a modem, high bypass ratio, <b>dual</b> <b>spool</b> turbofan engine is presented to identify the multitude of system level interactions that must be considered when developing such an engine. The Design Structure Matrix (DSM) is used to demonstrate how it maps these relationships and, if utilized in the right manner, can reduce the occurrence of escapes (i. e., a deliverable that does not meet customers' expectations). The context of this thesis is the complex system design, and development process, of a commercial aircraft gas turbine engine (specifically the Pratt & Whitney PW 4000 engine family). Unlike previous gas turbine engine DSM work, the matrix created in this thesis is generated {{from the point of}} view of the Systems Engineering organizations at Pratt & Whitney. The sequenced matrix captures the non-local knowledge that is currently absent from Pratt & Whitney's existing knowledge management documentation. Testing the DSM against past instances of rework and unexpected design issues substantiates its validity as the basis for performing this function. Finally, examples are presented to demonstrate how the DSM can be used to prevent future escapes. by Glenn D. Bartkowski. Thesis (S. M.)
