40|$|The <b>electric</b> <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> is in {{line with}} the {{circular}} economy concept due to the reuse of scrap. However, being energy intensive industries with a significant environmental impact, electric steelworks can increase their competitiveness and environmental sustainability through an adequate management of resource and energy. The paper presents a work related to the quantification of electric energy consumption and environmental impact of unconventional electric steelmaking scenarios while simultaneously monitoring the steel composition. The exploitation of an ad-hoc developed Decision Support Tool highlights that scrap quality strongly affects the monitored energy and environmental parameters (quantified in terms of Key Performance Indicators and aggregated in a Global Index). Moreover, the developed simulations pointed out that the removal of Fe-alloy addition during EAF tapping allows reducing slag and improving the yield by preserving also the steel quality while slightly increasing the electric energy consumption: in countries where the price and the emissions related to the production of electricity are low, this can be a good compromise to improve the environmental sustainability of the sector. The study shows that also limited modifications of the well-known electric steelmaking process could help to increase the sustainability of this energy intensive industrial production route...|$|E

50|$|The Soviet {{aid program}} of the 1950s was {{intended}} to develop China's economy and to organize it along Soviet lines. As part of its First Five-Year Plan (1953-57), China was {{the recipient of the}} most comprehensive technology transfer in modern industrial history. The Soviet Union provided aid for 156 major industrial projects concentrated in mining, power generation, and heavy industry. Following the Soviet model of economic development, these were large-scale, capital-intensive projects. By the late 1950s, China had made substantial progress in such fields as <b>electric</b> power, <b>steel</b> <b>production,</b> basic chemicals, and machine tools, as well as in production of military equipment such as artillery, tanks, and jet aircraft. The purpose of the program was to increase China's production of such basic commodities as coal and steel and to teach Chinese workers to operate imported or duplicated Soviet factories. These goals were met and, as a side effect, Soviet standards for materials, engineering practice, and factory management were adopted. In a move whose full costs would not become apparent for twenty-five years, Chinese industry also adopted the Soviet separation of research from production.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{investigation of}} possibility for {{electric arc furnace}} dust (EAFD) and electronic waste (e-waste) valorization trough stabilization process, {{in order to achieve}} concurrent management of these two serious ecological problems. EAFD is an ineviTab. waste material coming from the <b>electric</b> arc furnace <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> process, classified as a hazardous waste. Furthermore, {{it is well known that}} residual materials generated in the ewaste recycling process, like LCD (Liquid crystal displays) waste glass, are not suiTab. for landfill or incineration. In this study, these two materials were used for investigation of possibility for their valorization in ceramic industry. Thus, an innovative synergy of waste streams from metallurgical and e-waste recycling industry is presented. Investigation included a complex characterization of raw materials and their mixtures, using chemical methods, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, as well as methods for determining the physical and mechanical properties. Based on these results, it was found that material suiTab. for use in ceramics industry as a partial substituent of quartzite and fluxing components can be produced. Besides solving the environmental problem related to EAFD and LCD disposal, by replacement of raw materials certain economic effects can be achieved.

40|$|Germany’s Government has {{committed}} to an energy transition that reduces greenhouse gases by at least by 80 % by 2050 compared to 1990 level. This goal requires ambitious action in all sectors, also the industry, which emitted about 21 % of Germany’s total GHG emissions in 2013. We present a mitigation scenario that achieves a reduction in GHG emissions of 83 % by 2050 for the industrial sector. While this paper presents results for the industry sector, the scenario calculations have been accompanied by similar scenarios in all sectors aiming to achieve a total GHG mitigation of 80 % for the entire economy. The industry scenarios {{are based on the}} bottom-up model FORECAST, which allows simulating policies and induced technical change. It provides a very detailed breakdown of technologies. The resulting transition pathway reveals high importance of energy efficiency, particularly in electric motor systems, innovative process technologies and steam systems. It is resulting in a reduction of electricity demand by about 16 % and a reduction of fuel demand by about 32 % from 2010 to 2050. This shows that energy-efficiency alone is not sufficient – although important. The use of biomass increases to about 120 TWh in 2050. Coal is phased out in all sectors but in the iron and steel industry, which also experiences a drastic shift towards <b>electric</b> <b>steel.</b> Secondary <b>production</b> routes and alternative materials are also increasingly employed in paper, cement, glass and aluminium industries. By 2050, carbon capture and storage mitigates about 24 Mt CO 2 annually from emission-intensive processes (clinker and lime burning, steel, ammonia, ethylene and methanol). Power-to-heat gains importance after 2040 and reaches about 29 TWh in 2050. This scenario reflects a radical change to be achieved in less than 35 years, while the industry sector often shows high reluctance towards new policies and has a very long-living capital stock...|$|R

40|$|Analyses and/or {{scenarios}} of future industrial production, {{especially in the}} field of energy-intensive industries, can be useful for a variety of different task e. g. policy advice, energy demand modelling, resource availability/sustainability, and other. Especially future projection of the physical production differentiated on process level including the modelling of structural change and material strategies are of major importance to generate comprehensive and transparent scenario projections/results. In this context, another challenge is the modelling of this physical production in a hybrid model system, which means to link economic and demographic information provided by a macroeconomic model to the projection of physical production units, e. g. tonnes of an industrial branch. In this paper a short analysis of the historic <b>steel</b> <b>production</b> for selected European countries has been made, selected literature on material efficiency and recycling potentials is reported, and a methodology for the hybrid modelling of future <b>steel</b> use and <b>production</b> on process level as well as scrap availability is described. The paper shows that steel is an old energy-intensive product, facing a decreasing GDP intensity, with a trend to secondary production. This trend to secondary production makes the domestic scrap availability, but also trade in scrap and scrap quality an important factor which has to be considered when modelling future <b>steel</b> <b>production.</b> The developed methodology describes a comprehensive approach to translate macroeconomic sector information, e. g. economic value of an industry (gross value added), into apparent steel use/true steel use of a country and calculate its physical <b>production</b> of crude <b>steel,</b> <b>electric</b> <b>steel,</b> and oxygen steel considering structural change, prompt scrap availability, and end-of-life scrap availability on European level. Finally, limitations of the methods used will be discussed...|$|R
