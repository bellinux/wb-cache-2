5|$|In 1907, whilst back in Paris, Hunter met Alice Toklas, whom he {{had known}} {{previously}} in San Francisco. She took {{him to see the}} collection at 27 rue de Fleurus, that was being started by <b>Gertrude</b> <b>Stein</b> and her brother Leo Stein. Toklas wrote of this re-meeting that Hunter was at first shocked by the style of artists such as Matisse, but obviously strongly impressed.|$|E
5|$|In 1924 Pound secured {{funding for}} Ford Madox Ford's The Transatlantic Review from American {{attorney}} John Quinn. The Review published works by Pound, Hemingway and <b>Gertrude</b> <b>Stein,</b> {{as well as}} extracts from Joyce's Finnegans Wake, before the money ran out in 1925. It also published several Pound music reviews, later collected into Antheil and the Treatise on Harmony.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s Radclyffe Hall drew a crowd after her novel The Well of Loneliness had been {{banned in the}} UK. A reading by poet Edna St. Vincent Millay packed the salon in 1932.

5|$|From the 1890s to the 1930s, American heiress Natalie Clifford Barney held {{a weekly}} salon in Paris to which major artistic celebrities were invited and where lesbian topics were the focus. Combining Greek {{influences}} with contemporary French eroticism, {{she attempted to}} create an updated and idealized version of Lesbos in her salon. Her contemporaries included artist Romaine Brooks, who painted others in her circle; writers Colette, Djuna Barnes, social host <b>Gertrude</b> <b>Stein,</b> and novelist Radclyffe Hall.|$|E
5|$|Its early members {{included}} <b>Gertrude</b> <b>Stein</b> and Judah Leon Magnes, {{who studied}} at Temple Sinai's Sabbath school, and Ray Frank, who taught them. Originally traditional, the temple reformed its {{beliefs and practices}} {{under the leadership of}} Rabbi Marcus Friedlander (1893–1915). By 1914, it had become a Classical Reform congregation. That year the current sanctuary was built: a Beaux-Arts structure designed by G. Albert Lansburgh, which is the oldest synagogue building in Oakland.|$|E
5|$|During Levy's tenure, {{the synagogue}} had several congregants who were famous, or would become so. Ray Frank, the first Jewish woman to preach {{formally}} from a pulpit in the United States, settled in Oakland around 1885, and taught Hebrew Bible studies and Jewish history at First Hebrew Congregation's Sabbath school, {{where she was}} superintendent. Her students there in the 1880s included <b>Gertrude</b> <b>Stein,</b> later to become a famous writer, and Judah Leon Magnes, who would become a prominent Reform rabbi. Magnes's views of the Jewish people were strongly influenced by First Hebrew's Rabbi Levy, {{and it was at}} the building on 13th and Clay that Magnes first began preaching—his bar mitzvah speech of 1890 was quoted at length in The Oakland Tribune.|$|E

5|$|David's first book, A Book of Mediterranean Food, {{frequently}} {{referred to}} by the abbreviated title of Mediterranean Food, was published by John Lehmann in 1950, only a year after David's first articles had started appearing in British periodicals. The original typescript of the book consisted almost entirely of reused versions of her recent articles. It was submitted to and turned down {{by a series of}} publishers, one of whom told her that it needed something more than just the bare recipes. David took note, and wrote some linking text, interspersing her own brief prose with relevant excerpts {{from a wide range of}} authors known for their writings about the Mediterranean. They included Norman Douglas, Lawrence Durrell, <b>Gertrude</b> <b>Stein,</b> D. H. Lawrence, Osbert Sitwell, Compton Mackenzie, Arnold Bennett, Henry James and Théophile Gautier.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, he {{reconciled}} with Breton, and sporadically attended the Surrealists' meetings in Paris. The same year, he issued the poetry book De nos oiseaux ("Of Our Birds"). This period saw {{the publication of}} The Approximate Man (1931), alongside the volumes L'Arbre des voyageurs ("The Travelers' Tree", 1930), Où boivent les loups ("Where Wolves Drink", 1932), L'Antitête ("The Antihead", 1933) and Grains et issues ("Seed and Bran", 1935). By then, it was also announced that Tzara had started work on a screenplay. In 1930, he directed and produced a cinematic version of Le Cœur à barbe, starring Breton and other leading Surrealists. Five years later, he signed his name to The Testimony against <b>Gertrude</b> <b>Stein,</b> published by Eugene Jolas's magazine transition in reply to Stein's memoir The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas, in which he accused his former friend of being a megalomaniac.|$|E
5|$|On August 25, he {{was present}} at the liberation of Paris although, {{contrary}} to the Hemingway legend, he was not the first into the city, nor did he liberate the Ritz. In Paris, he visited Sylvia Beach and Pablo Picasso with Mary Welsh, who joined him there; in a spirit of happiness, he forgave <b>Gertrude</b> <b>Stein.</b> Later that year, he {{was present at}} heavy fighting in the Battle of Hürtgen Forest. On December 17, 1944, a feverish and ill Hemingway had himself driven to Luxembourg to cover what was later called The Battle of the Bulge. As soon as he arrived, however, Lanham handed him to the doctors, who hospitalized him with pneumonia; by the time that he recovered a week later, most of the fighting in this battle was over.|$|E

50|$|Bispham was {{the first}} singer to {{introduce}} Brahms's Four Serious Songs and Magelone Lieder to American audiences in the 1896-97 concert season. Bispham also sang Horatio Parker's oratorio, Hora Novissima, in 1897 (with Johanna Gadski, <b>Gertrude</b> May <b>Stein,</b> and Evan Williams as the other soloists). Upon his immediate return to Great Britain, he provided {{a copy of the}} score to Hans Richter, which led to the premiere of the piece in Worcester, England, and the Festival of the Three Choirs.|$|R
25|$|The joint {{collection}} of <b>Gertrude</b> and Leo <b>Stein</b> began in late 1904 when Michael Stein announced that their trust account had accumulated {{a balance of}} 8,000 francs.

5000|$|Following {{the success}} of Glackens' buying campaign, Barnes {{traveled}} to Paris twice himself, the same year. In December, he met <b>Gertrude</b> and Leo <b>Stein</b> and purchased his first two Matisse paintings from them. Barnes purchased his collection of African Art from art dealer Paul Guillaume (1891- 1934), who served briefly as the Barnes Foundation's [...] "foreign secretary." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{sculptor}} Jacques Lipchitz {{introduced them}} to architect Le Corbusier, then largely unknown, who, during this time, was designing {{a series of}} villas, including innovative homes for Michael <b>Stein</b> (<b>Gertrude's</b> brother) and Lipchitz himself. In 1926, they commissioned the architect to design what Le Corbusier said was the first [...] "true cubic house," [...] called Villa Cook or Maison Cook, {{on the outskirts of}} Paris.|$|R
25|$|Although the {{pictures}} were widely derided—"A pot of paint has been flung {{in the face of}} the public", declared the critic Camille Mauclair (1872–1945)—they also attracted some favorable attention. The painting that was singled out for the most attacks was Matisse's Woman with a Hat; the purchase of this work by <b>Gertrude</b> and Leo <b>Stein</b> had a very positive effect on Matisse, who was suffering demoralization from the bad reception of his work.|$|R
25|$|The {{influence}} of cubism extended to other artistic fields, outside painting and sculpture. In literature, the written works of <b>Gertrude</b> <b>Stein</b> employ repetition and repetitive phrases as building blocks in both passages and whole chapters. Most of Stein's important works utilize this technique, including the novel The Making of Americans (1906–08). Not only were they the first important patrons of Cubism, <b>Gertrude</b> <b>Stein</b> {{and her brother}} Leo were also important influences on Cubism as well. Picasso in turn was an important influence on Stein's writing.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gertrude</b> <b>Stein</b> began {{acquiring}} Picasso's {{drawings and}} paintings and exhibiting {{them in her}} informal Salon {{at her home in}} Paris. At one of her gatherings in 1905 he met Henri Matisse (1869–1954), who was to become in those days his chief rival, although in later years a close friend. The Steins introduced Picasso to Claribel Cone (1864–1929), and her sister Etta Cone (1870–1949), also American art collectors, who began to acquire Picasso and Matisse's paintings. Eventually Leo Stein moved to Italy, and Michael and Sarah Stein became important patrons of Matisse, while <b>Gertrude</b> <b>Stein</b> continued to collect Picasso.|$|E
25|$|Guests at {{the banquet}} Rousseau of 1908, in {{addition}} to Picasso and the guest of honor, included Jean Metzinger, Juan Gris, Max Jacob, Marie Laurencin, Guillaume Apollinaire, André Salmon, , Daniel-Henri Kahnweiler, Leo Stein and <b>Gertrude</b> <b>Stein.</b>|$|E
50|$|In Paris she {{remained}} close to Tom Keogh, who was drawing illustrations for books and magazines, including {{the cover of}} the first Paris edition of Vogue (magazine). She was also close to Tom’s wife, novelist Theodora Roosevelt, granddaughter of President Teddy. She knew society arts patron Marie-Laure, Vicomtesse de Noaille, as well as Julian <b>Stein</b> (<b>Gertrude</b> Stein’s nephew), French illustrator William Pene duBois, and American humorist Art Buchwald. Pierone illustrated Buchwald’s book Paris After Dark.|$|R
50|$|In 1907, Pach {{moved to}} France and {{became part of}} the <b>Gertrude</b> and Leo <b>Stein</b> circle, and moved among the Parisian avant-garde, exhibiting with them and writing about their work and new artistic vision. In 1908 he wrote the first article on Cézanne to be {{published}} in the U.S., which appeared in Scribner's Magazine. He also interviewed Claude Monet that year and published an article about him in the same periodical. He helped manage and teach in several of William Merritt Chase's summer art schools in various European locales.|$|R
40|$|Fear is a {{productive}} power through which morality, law, {{and the state}} are founded and maintained. Focusing on late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Anglo-Saxon American men?s pathological fear of disease ranging from neurasthenia and hysteria to bubonic plague, this dissertation suggests that turn-of-the-century medical discourse, manifesting the age?s ideological evaluation of vice and virtue, was instrumental in shaping and sustaining the racial and sexual order of American society. The pseudo-scientific discourse of imagined immunities or vulnerabilities to these diseases, conceived as the bodily evidence of racial and sexual difference, entailed imagined communities and hierarchies among the different races and sexes. Reading Edward Bellamy?s Looking Backward 2000 - 1887, <b>Gertrude</b> <b>Stein?s</b> ?Melanctha: Each One As She May,? and Sinclair Lewis?s Arrowsmith as medical records, this study identifies the heightened nativist, racist, misogynist, and imperialist impulses of turn-of-the-century America channeled through the knowledge of psychopathology, neurology, bacteriology, and immunology. The symptoms and treatments of neurasthenia, hysteria, and bubonic plague portrayed in these fictions ventriloquize the American dis-eases over overcivilized effeminacy and racial and national decadence, originating {{as a response to}} the threats posed by immigrants, women?s advancement, and the closure of the frontier. A clinical diagnosis of the sleepless hero in Looking Backward as a neurasthenic, the epitome of the bodily weakness and racial superiority of the Anglo-Saxon American, addresses the collaboration between contemporary racial ideas and medical and hygienic theories which served to shape the design of Bellamy?s ethnocentric utopia. This dissertation then argues that Melanctha Herbert in her namesake short story was modeled on the representative characteristics of a hysterical woman through which Anglo-Saxon American men reconfirmed their privileged position in society. Focusing on the bubonic plague that represented an alien threat to the American body and body politic in the 1900 s, I, in the following chapter, read Arrowsmith as the narrative of an American imperialist doctor whose quest for immunity laid the foundation of the empire and its biopolitical sovereignty. Not only did these diseases work as a metaphor for American fears of heterogeneity, but they also functioned as a regenerative device that rendered white American ideals and values more dynamic and resilient...|$|R
