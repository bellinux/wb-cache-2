Presented model are computational fluid dynamic modelbased on dimensions and the construction of the real <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>duct.</b> The measurement parameters from real object are used to the model validation. Mentioned measurements of the air flow are conducted by Venturi orifice for different loads of the engine and the different flow characteristics of the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>duct.</b> The results from computational fluid dynamic model are useful to calibration the orifice by setting the orifice module. The orifice module changes up to 6 % of the mean values for all considered loads of the engine and throttling’s of the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>duct.</b> The approximation the flow characteristic for other throttling’s of the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>duct</b> was conducted also. The obtained approximation is useful tool to calculate the air flow to the engine for the different throttling’s than measured. Linear dependence between the air mass flow {{and the power of the}} engine at the constant engine speed was observed. The throttling of the cross section area of the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>duct</b> causes changing the characteristic in accordance to a second order polynomial.

40|$|Presented paper shows {{results of}} {{laboratory}} {{tests on the}} relationship between the throttling of a cross area of an <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>duct</b> and the composition of exhaust gas from the marine engine. The object of research is a laboratory four-stroke diesel engine, worked with a load from 50 kW to 250 kW at a constant speed. During the laboratory, tests over 50 parameters were measured of the engine with technical condition recognized as a “working properly ” and with a simulated the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>duct</b> throttling. The simulation consisted of inserting the throttling flanges to the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>duct</b> before compressor, limiting duct cross-sectional area by 20 % and 60 % respectively. The results of laboratory research confirm that the effect of the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>duct</b> throttling on the engine thermodynamic parameters is clearly visible only at considerable throttling. In the case of measuring the composition of exhaust gas, both mole fractions and emissions of gaseous components markedly affected even at low throttling. For example, 20 % throttling of the cross section of the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>duct</b> increase the mole fraction of carbon monoxide in exhaust gas almost 44 % during working the engine with load equal to 250 kW, and only 10 % of the temperature after air cooler. Keep in mind that the temperature after air cooler was an engine parameter, which undergoes the greatest change during the simulation of that malfunction. The conclusion is that the results of measurements of the composition of exhaust gas may contain valuable diagnostic information about the technical condition of the air delivery to the engine system...|$|R

50|$|An air {{conditioning}} system, or a standalone air conditioner, provides cooling and humidity control for {{all or part}} of a building. Air conditioned buildings often have sealed windows, because open windows would work against the system intended to maintain constant indoor <b>air</b> conditions. Outside, <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> is generally drawn into the system by a vent into the indoor heat exchanger section, creating positive air pressure. The percentage of return air made up of <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> can usually be manipulated by adjusting the opening of this vent. Typical <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> is about 10%.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the oil cooler seals; this engine can also have an issue with {{the design of the}} positive crankcase ventilation system. The crankcase ventilation system vents to the inlet of the turbo. The issue is that the air vented from the crankcase contains too much oil to easily pass through the swirl motor valves downstream of the turbo. Once this oil and sludge begin to accumulate, the valve becomes inoperative and blows a fuse that controls many other sensors required to properly operate the engine and emission system. This will immediately place the vehicle into limp home mode and limit the rpm to 3000. It also causes a check engine light and numerous OBDII Codes. Mercedes Benz has previously recognized this feature of the vehicle and has stated that this engine feature, the accumulation of oil at the turbo inlet, is [...] "normal". In a Technical Service Bulletin they issued in 2008 they state:"Engine oil venting occurs on the right hand side of the engine <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>duct.</b> For this reason there is always some oil in the engine <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>duct,</b> see (Figure 3). This is no justification for replacing the turbocharger. Turbochargers replaced for this reason will not be covered by warranty." [...] While a slight amount of oil may be normal and acceptable, sufficient quantities and accumulation will indeed lead to other failures as identified above.|$|R

Instead, the Hornet uses bleed air vents on the inboard surface of the engine <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>ducts</b> to slow and reduce the amount of air reaching the engine.

40|$|Presented paper {{shows the}} results of the {{laboratory}} tests on the relationship between throttling of both <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>duct</b> and exhaust gas duct and a gaseous emission from the marine engine. The object of research is a laboratory, four-stroke, DI diesel engine, operated at loads from 50 kW to 250 kW at a constant speed equal to 750 rpm. During the laboratory tests over 50 parameters of the engine were measured with its technical condition recognized as a „working properly” and with simulated leakage of both <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> valve and exhaust gas valve on the second cylinder. The results of this laboratory research confirm that the leakage of cylinder valves causes no significant changes of the thermodynamic parameters of the engine. Simulated leakages through the inlet and exhaust valve caused a significant increase in fuel consumption of the engine. Valve leakages cause an increase of the exhaust gas temperature behind the cylinder with leakage and behind other cylinders. The exhaust gas temperature increase is relatively small and clearly visible only at low loads of the engine. The increase of the temperature and pressure of the charging air behind the intercooler were observed too. Charging air temperature is significantly higher during the engine operation with inlet valve leakage. The study results show significant increases of the CO, NOx and CO 2 emission for all the mentioned malfunctions. The conclusion is that {{the results of}} measurements of the composition of the exhaust gas may contain valuable diagnostic information about the technical condition of the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>duct</b> and the exhaust gas duct of the marine engine...|$|R

A series of experiments were conducted under different occupancy levels and different weather situation. Both the indoor air quality and the energy consumption were studied in these experiments.
