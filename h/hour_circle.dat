50|$|In astronomy, the <b>hour</b> <b>circle</b> of a {{celestial}} object {{is the great}} circle through the object and the celestial poles. It is perpendicular to the celestial equator. The declination of an object as observed on the celestial sphere is the angle measured along the <b>hour</b> <b>circle</b> of that object to the celestial equator. In other words, it is analogous to meridians or longitudes on a globe. A meridian on the celestial sphere matches an <b>hour</b> <b>circle</b> at any time. So called because the angle between the planes of the hour circles (or the difference in longitudes) of two objects is sometimes measured in hours (or hours, minutes, and seconds), one revolution (360°) being equivalent to 24 hours, or 1 hour being equivalent to 15°.|$|E

50|$|In {{astronomy}} and celestial navigation, the hour angle {{is one of}} the coordinates used in the equatorial coordinate system to give the direction of a point on the celestial sphere.The hour angle of a point is the angle between two planes: one containing the Earth's axis and the zenith (the meridian plane), and the other containing the Earth's axis and the given point (the <b>hour</b> <b>circle</b> passing through the point).|$|E
50|$|In spherical astronomy, the {{parallactic angle}} is the angle between the great circle through a {{celestial}} object and the zenith, and the <b>hour</b> <b>circle</b> of the object. It is usually denoted q. In the triangle zenith—object—celestial pole, the parallactic angle {{will be the}} position angle of the zenith at the celestial object. Despite its name, this angle is unrelated with parallax. The parallactic angle is zero when the object crosses the meridian.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively {{to right}} ascension, hour angle (abbreviated HA or LHA, local hour angle), a left-handed system, {{measures}} the angular distance {{of an object}} westward along the celestial equator from the observer's meridian to the <b>hour</b> <b>circle</b> passing through the object. Unlike right ascension, hour angle is always increasing with the rotation of Earth. Hour angle may be considered a means of measuring the time since upper culmination, the moment when an object contacts the meridian overhead.|$|E

[...] In 1839, Sir Henry Ward said in the House of Commons, [...] "Look at the British Colonial empire — the most magnificent empire that the world ever saw.

50|$|In astronomy, {{hour angle}} {{is defined as}} the angular {{distance}} on the celestial sphere measured westward along the celestial equator from the meridian to the <b>hour</b> <b>circle</b> passing through a point.
