5|$|Sustainable use of {{materials}} has targeted {{the idea of}} <b>dematerialization,</b> converting the linear path {{of materials}} (extraction, use, disposal in landfill) to a circular material flow that reuses materials as much as possible, much like the cycling and reuse of waste in nature. This approach is supported by product stewardship and {{the increasing use of}} material flow analysis at all levels, especially individual countries and the global economy. The use of sustainable biomaterials that come from renewable sources and that can be recycled is preferred to the use on non-renewables from a life cycle standpoint.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the chapter}} is to provide an initial {{qualitative}} analysis of {{the role that the}} school images play on the Web 2. 0. Through social media, in fact, the intrinsic social-relational funcion of school photographs seems to amplify by calatysing the web users' interests, evoking shared memories, building connections between people and giving birth to e-communities - just in virtue of the historic photos' potential to create an emotional and multi-sensory connection between people and what is called Past, even in the <b>dematerializations</b> and rematerializations of digital environments, as sociological and anthropological research has highlighted. Through significant example and case-studies, an initial review is offered, of the most common social practices to which school photographs are subjected today on the web and social media, and which can be summarized as follows: social sharing of school photos as a mnemonic support and a fulcrum of social relationships on the web; the exposure and narration of the Self mediated by school photos; the memories of places and school buildings as monuments of the collective school memory; the creative and participative re-elaboration of school photos (emerging in particular in the practice of school photo-mashups) as real tools for learning and knowledge...|$|R
5000|$|Bertrand Méheust, a French sociologist, began a {{study of}} the science fiction {{parallels}} to ufo mythology when he stumbled upon a copy of the 1908 novel The Lightning Wheel by Jean de la Hire in his family's attic. He opened it and began reading how the central characters find themselves being lifted up by a ray into a flying disc that hums and glows with a halo of light. The discovery stimulated a search for parallels between ufo experience narratives and pre-1947 science fiction literature. Meheust found dozens of them, many of the more impressive including such wondrous effects as invisible force-fields, mesmeric mental effects, materializations and <b>dematerializations,</b> teleportation, traveling through walls, levitating entities, and engine-stopping rays. One could also find humanoids visiting earth for a range of motives that parallel later UFO thought: wanting to spy on humans, experiment on us, breed with us, create a multi-generational program to shape humanity, deal with their dying world, invade our world, and teach us lessons about cosmic history and the need for peace. While some of this can be relegated to coincidences driven by similar reasoning and expectations about the future, often these wonders are more reminiscent of supernatural and old occult mythology than what is really reasonably expected to be created using future technology. Michel Monnerie wove Meheust's study into his larger historical critique of what shaped ufo mythology. [...] Michel Meurger deserves special mention for expanding Meheust's thesis into an impressive compendium of parallels brimming with nearly 800 footnotes and a set of dozens of illustrations. [...] One subsequent paper, in English, presents a focused historical study, showing a continuum between the nightmarish medical horrors experienced in modern ufo abduction narratives, back through the mad scientists of pulp science fiction, that built in turn upon anti-vivisection propaganda and rumors circulating in the 19th century.|$|R
40|$|Radical Matter" {{argues that}} {{expansive}} and experimental mixed mode poetic works since the American mid-century embody a language-based materiality that motivates the valuations of their symbolic economies. I focus on three works [...] William Carlos Williams's Paterson, Bernadette Mayer's Studying Hunger Journals, and Juliana Spahr's Well Then There Now [...] that each engage prose alongside verse, material from other texts and authors, or multiple discursive modes: all ways, I argue, of substantiating the desires and rhetorical strategies that orient these speakers {{in language and}} {{in relation to their}} imagined addressees. These substantiations bring forward features and consequences of language's articulations as discourse [...] whether lyric, narrative, epistolary, diaristic, or other [...] that carry out metaphoric interventions in the crises of value that drive these poetic works towards their substantial lengths, their material and modal inclusivity, and the speakers that they voice. I read Paterson's larger strategy of textual bricolage and its local junctures between prose and verse as expressions of the portability of lyric discourse's sensory and semantic functions. The circulations and evolutions of lyric figures and phrasal units throughout the work act in opposition to the expressive and libidinal paralyses of the stagnant American economic and social body that the poem's matter documents. Against the reifications of established forms [...] aesthetic forms as well as the institutions and conventions that organize social life [...] Williams manifests language's broadest functional value through the material resources of lyric. The discursive junctions of Bernadette Mayer's Studying Hunger Journals activate the rhetorical relations of lyric, epistolary, and diaristic address as sites where speakers and addressees materialize as embodiments of the pronominal figures "I" and "you. " I test these materializations against psychoanalytic and structural linguistic models of subject formation in order to read Mayer's drive towards atemporality and the indeterminacy of her interlocutors in terms of the personal history her journals document. Through the materializations and <b>dematerializations</b> of grammatical persons, Mayer rehearses the lack and losses that motivate her hunger and which the operations of language make manifest. In my last chapter, I read Spahr's collection of prose, verse, and prose poetry, Well Then There Now, in terms of its orientation towards difference as the material consequence of her opaque plural pronominal lyric protagonists "we" and "they" and her transparent first person prose speaker, as well as the intertextual reading that her multi-mode collection demands. I argue that Spahr's materialization of difference and the readerly exclusions it enacts constitutes an anti-pluralist resistance to rhetorical demands of readerly identification and inclusivity with poetic speakers. The "matter" of Spahr's works [...] personal, political, environmental, and economic systems of interrelation and complicity [...] becomes "radical" by virtue of a rhetoric that manifests difference as the fundamental condition of language and the requisite term in active, self-organized reading...|$|R

Then he turned to defending the EDI hypothesis: in addition to the observations of materialization and <b>dematerialization,</b> he cited the [...] "poltergeist" [...] phenomenon experienced by some people after a close encounter; the photographs of UFOs, sometimes in only one frame, and not seen by witnesses; the changing of form in front of witnesses; the puzzling question of telepathic communication; that in close encounters of the third kind, the creatures seem to be at home in Earth's gravity and atmosphere; the sudden stillness {{in the presence of the}} craft; levitation of cars or people; and the development by some of psychic abilities after an encounter.

His engagements will not allow him to visit this country immediately, but he is very enthusiastic about it, and he is bound to come before long. Now, as you seem to be interested in this ex-Kilbright, we will make you an offer. We will give him into your charge until we want him. He is of no use to us, as he can't tell us anything about spiritual matters, his present memory beginning just where it broke off when he sank in the ocean in seventeen eighty-five, but he might be very useful to a man who was inclined to study up old-time manners and customs. And so, if it suits you, we will make him over to you, agreeing to give you three days' notice before we take any measures to dematerialize him. We are not afraid of your getting away with him, for our power over him will be all the same, no matter where he is." ...|$|E

This, in a short time, they expect to receive, and they assure me that they will not hesitate to put it in force if I should cause them trouble.

I have been restored to that mortality from which I was suddenly snatched by the cruel sea, and I do not wish to lose it again until I have lived out my natural term of years. My family is one of long life, and I feel that I have a right to fifty more years of existence, and this strong desire for the natural remainder of my life is that which gives these men their power over me.
