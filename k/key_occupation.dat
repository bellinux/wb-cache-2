30|$|Agriculture is an {{important}} source of income and at times, villagers suffer loss due to erratic, low rainfall and power deficit for ground water irrigation. With the increasing cost for lifting ground water, the price yielded from crops is short to cover the expenses. The vagaries in the returns from agriculture force the people to scout for other occupations as a cushion. The villagers perceive that other avenues such as business and employment provide better earnings, as evident from the shift in the principal source of income in some of the villages. Changes in their lifestyle also make the villagers look towards the neighboring city for gainful activities. Educated people have almost completely exited from agriculture or livestock as their <b>key</b> <b>occupation.</b> The village which showed preference towards agriculture was Ramnagar (64.7 % increase), while the village that moved away was Darapur [37.04 % decline, (Fig.  5)]. In Banjara Nangla, 75 % of the villagers shifted from agriculture, the highest (100 %) occupation in the village in 1991, to salaries/wages.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the impact of employer flexibility to work-life issues and negative spillover from work to non-work life on the attitudes of software developers. Software workers present an interesting case for work-life balance issues - Ackroyd et al (2000) designate them the <b>key</b> <b>occupation</b> to examine in future studies of 'knowledge workers', and Barrett (2001) states {{that they are the}} 'vanguard' of new working practices, with the separation of work and life being substantially more 'blurred' than for more traditional occupations. Despite this general perception of the work-life boundary, our results show that intrusion of work into private life for this group of workers still has a substantial impact on work-related attitudes. Work-life boundary variables affect trust in the organisation which plays a mediational role in these variables' relationship to job satisfaction and organisational commitment. Our results suggest that even within this industry, where employees are relatively individualistic in orientation, highly marketable and unlikely to show attachment to a single organisation, mutual gains for employee and employer can be attained by an accommodating approach to non-work commitments which may lead to greater organisational attachment...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine if differences existed in mathematical skills needed for entry-level employment in selected electricity-electronics occupations in Oregon. The four primary objectives of the study were to: 1. Identify mathematical skills from task analyses of <b>key</b> electricity-electronics <b>occupations.</b> 2. Validate the identified mathematical skills. 3. Test the null hypothesis that there are no significant differences among responses of industrial workers and instructors. 4. Construct an inventory of validated mathematical skills ranked according to importance. A review committee identified mathematical skills required for performance of tasks in the occupations of electronic assembler, electrician, appliance serviceman, radio and T. V. repairman, and electronics technician. A mail-survey questionnaire was developed utilizing the identified mathematical skills and administered to the six groups of randomly selected respondents. The study's population utilized 13 businesses and industries and the total number (30) of secondary schools in Oregon offering approved Electricity-Electronics cluster programs. The sample for the study consisted of 10 instructors and 10 industrial workers from each of the five <b>key</b> <b>occupations,</b> or a total of 60 respondents. Analysis of the data revealed that there were significant differences among the six groups in all but 14 of the 54 skill items. Of those skills which were studied, a greater number of them were needed for entry-level employment in the <b>key</b> <b>occupations</b> of radio and T. V. repairman, electronic technician, and electrician than there were for assembler and appliance serviceman. Selected recommendations include the following: 1. The findings of this study pertaining to mathematical skills needed for entry-level employment should be considered in future revisions of the Electricity-Electronics Cluster Guide. 2. The findings of this study should be utilized in developing instructional material concerning mathematical skills as taught by the cluster instructor or by other instructors through an interdisciplinary approach. 3. In-service activities conducted for cluster teachers should be designed to provide the range of mathematical skills needed for entry-level employment in the <b>key</b> <b>occupations.</b> 4.

40|$|The {{transition}} of foster youth from state care to independent living has received increased research, practice, and policy {{attention in the}} United States and in many other countries. Most contributions to this literature have focused on documenting poor outcomes across various dimensions of need in the young people's lives whereas {{little attention has been}} given to the policy context in which the responses to those needs are being developed. In this article, we argue that there is a pressing need for better understanding of how the policy context can both promote and impede the development of appropriate services. To illustrate our argument, we use Northern Ireland as a policy case study both because of recent initiatives underway there in regard to youth transitions from state care and because of the heightened political sensibilities associated with it as a society. We draw attention to the socio-political historical context, a number of intersecting social policies, and the place of social work as a <b>key</b> <b>occupation</b> involved in delivering service improvements. We conclude by suggesting that this case study not only highlights the need to address similar aspects of the policy on youth transition from state care in the United States but also demonstrates the benefits of reflecting on policy development and implementation elsewhere in the world. ...|$|E
40|$|It is {{increasingly}} common {{to live in}} continual flux between reality and virtuality – for architecture this means a dwindling focus on the built environment. For the architectural discipline to respond to these rapidly changing user-demands, a proactive relationship with our digital environment is required. It is proposed that a <b>key</b> <b>occupation</b> of the architectural discipline {{in the near future}} will be designing architecture that caters to our ‘real-world’ selves but takes advantage of the broad range of data available to us from the digital realm. This thesis proposes that within the big data stored about all those who engage with the digital environment, lies data that can influence and benefit the architectural discipline and allow us to respond convincingly to the increasing focus on digital and virtual engagement. As people increasingly ‘live online’ architects can now derive information about clients not only from meeting them in person but also by scraping data on their digital lives and constructing what is referred to in this thesis as a digital identity. The digital identity can include data about a myriad of architectural influences such as taste, activity and lifestyle. This thesis considers which data may become available over the next decade, how architectural designers can embrace it without specialist data-centric skill-sets and how it may help personalise architecture. A large amount of data is collected on the author from both ‘real-world’ scenarios and ‘virtual’ inhabitation of digital space. This data, along with other public sources of data are explored in terms of architectural potential, culminating in a vision for a new data-based and ultimately more efficient method for personalising and inhabiting architecture...|$|E

40|$|The growing {{sustainability}} discourse within occupational science necessitates {{research on}} sustainability from an occupational perspective. Sustainable living is often presented in popular media and social discourse as individual sacrifice for the collective good, or “living with less. ” This narrow depiction has political, social, and academic implications and is problematic as we {{grapple with the}} consequences of global ecological degradation. It is also inconsistent with the narratives and experiences of people who undertake sustainability based lifestyles. This paper integrates analysis of depictions of sustainability and “green living” in popular media with an ethnographic case study of a family living a sustainability based lifestyle. Case study data collection included interviews, participant observation and administration of the Occupational Questionnaire (Smith et al); analysis methods included open and focused coding and ongoing member checking of findings. The case was selected from a larger study examining the experiences of occupational categorization of nonworking adults (Whalley Hammell), and is used here to illustrate the meanings and practice and problematize common depictions of sustainability based occupations. Sustainable living in the case study is constituted by a process of ongoing change and identity negotiation. Additional themes of social responsibility, community, occupational roles, and consumption emerged from this case study. Although the study began with inquiry into the experiences of a single family member, an unexpected finding was that the level of the individual was not ideal for understanding occupations or experiences related to sustainable living. A Communities of Practice framework (Wenger) was used to understand these experiences, and I suggest that inquiry at the family and community level may provide valuable insights and stimulate dialogue in occupational science about issues of sustainability. Such dialogue would broaden our understanding of occupation beyond the level of the individual. This paper makes suggestions for ways in which such inquiry might be better undertaken in Occupational Science. Findings from the case study indicate that sustainability based occupations are meaningful and complex, and may serve to enrich family life and community integration. This paper makes an argument for reframing the discourse to be consistent with the experiences of people who undertake sustainable living, to inform both scientific inquiry and the tone with which the broader sustainability discourse is undertaken. Discussion questions: How can the lived experiences of individuals engaged in sustainability based occupations inform the sustainability discourse? What are the political implications of the language used to discuss sustainability? Does the popular and political discourse of sustainability shape occupational engagement? How can occupational science make a unique contribution to the sustainability dialogue? How can Occupational Science expand inquiry into the meaning and practice of occupation beyond the level of the individual?

These declines coupled with skills shortages in <b>key</b> <b>occupations,</b> such as engineering have created concern among scholars, employers and policy makers. This dissertation utilized the recent conceptualization of life course fit to understand voluntary turnover intentions among employees in the United States by examining the predictors of life course fit (Study I) and the association between life course fit and voluntary turnover intentions (Study II). Occupation, sex, sex composition of occupation and workplace social support predicted life course fit. Life course fit significantly predicted turnover intentions accounting for 11 % of the variance in turnover intentions. Life course fit partially mediated the association between organizational commitment and turnover intentions, as well as the association between job satisfaction and turnover intentions. Supervisor support and coworker support moderated the association between life course fit and turnover intentions such that higher levels of support weakened the association between fit and turnover intentions for those who experienced a lack of fit.

This logjam {{suggests that there are}} specific human factors such as selection biases operating against candidates from certain countries in the New Zealand employment context. The issue of selection bias was addressed by examining the perceived similarity between country-of-origin to country-of-destination, and the perceived social dominance of country-of-origin vis-Ȥ-vis country-of-destination. Eighty Subject Matter Experts with approximately 10 years experience participating in/watching selection panels completed a scenario format that elicited their estimates of Human Resource and Line Managers' selection preferences for jobs in twelve <b>key</b> <b>occupations.</b> Candidates were presented as coming from countries-of-origin that varied from Australia to Southern and South East Asian, Southern African, and Pacific Island nations, but were otherwise equally skilled, qualified for the given job, and costly to employ.

This data shaped surveys given to organizational newcomers in phase II, which measured organizational culture and cognitive leadership schemas. It was hypothesized that implicit leadership theories (ILTs) would reflect respective organizational cultures. Although this was supported in the qualitative results from Phase I, it was not supported in the quantitative results from Phase II. However, analyses showed that leadership is still perceived as a masculine role in both the U. S. Army and U. S. Air Force, as was hypothesized. It was also hypothesized that leaders in line occupations would be seen as better leaders than leaders in staff occupations. This was supported for the Air Force sample, but not the Army sample. During the interviews, ROTC instructors asserted that male and female leaders were equally capable, and that line and staff leaders were equally capable.
