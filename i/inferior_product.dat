5|$|The {{collection}} {{was met with}} mostly positive critical reviews, with many appreciating the gathering of some of Yankovic's best works. However, the box set was not a high seller, and {{near the end of}} the 1990s, it ranked as Yankovic's least-purchased album. In 2006, due to a mishap by Volcano Records, the artwork for the set was lost, and the collection went out of print. Yankovic refused to scan existing copies of the album to make new ones, fearing that it would lead to an <b>inferior</b> <b>product.</b>|$|E
25|$|While many AFL {{players and}} {{observers}} believed their league was {{the equal of}} the NFL, their first two Super Bowl performances did nothing to prove it. However, on November 17, 1968, when NBC cut away from a game between the Jets and Raiders to air the children's movie Heidi, the ensuing uproar helped disprove the notion that fans still considered the AFL an <b>inferior</b> <b>product.</b> The perception of AFL inferiority forever changed on January 12, 1969, when the AFL Champion New York Jets shocked the heavily favored NFL Champion Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III. The Colts, who entered the contest favored {{by as many as}} 18 points, had completed the 1968 NFL season with a 13–1 record, and won the NFL title with a convincing 34–0 win over the Cleveland Browns. Led by their stalwart defense—which allowed a record-low 144 points—the 1968 Colts were considered one of the best-ever NFL teams.|$|E
25|$|Ya'an is {{the main}} market for {{a special kind of}} tea which is grown {{in this part of the}} country and {{exported}} in very large quantities to Tibet via Kangding and over the caravan routes through Batang (Paan) and Teko. Although the Chinese regard it as an <b>inferior</b> <b>product,</b> it is greatly esteemed by the Tibetans for its powerful flavor, which harmonizes particularly well with that of the rancid yak's butter which they mix with their tea. Brick tea comprises not only what we call tea leaves, but also the coarser leaves and some of the twigs of the shrub, as well as the leaves and fruit of other plants and trees (the alder, for instance). This amalgam is steamed, weighed, and compressed into hard bricks, which are packed up in coarse matting in subunits of four. These rectangular parcels weigh between twenty-two and twenty-six pounds—the quality of the tea makes a slight difference to the weight—and are carried to Kangting by coolies. A long string of them, moving slowly under their monstrous burdens of tea, was a familiar sight along the road I followed.|$|E

40|$|In many {{differentiated}} good markets, consumers need {{to learn}} about products be-fore purchasing them. They tend to search products that others buy. This kind of observational learning may lead to inefficient herd behavior, in which consumers ignore superior products or waste resources learning about <b>inferior</b> <b>products.</b> We develop a model of herds in which consumers observe only aggregate purchases, and not, as in the standard herding model, the complete ordered history of search actions. We show that the purchasing information changes {{the conditions under which}} herds can occur for both low and high quality <b>products.</b> <b>Inferior</b> <b>products</b> are certain to be ignored; high quality products may be ignored, but complete learning may also occur.

50|$|The {{essay is}} {{concerned}} with the production of cultural content in capitalist societies. It critiques the supply-driven nature of cultural economies as well as the apparently <b>inferior</b> <b>products</b> of the system. Horkheimer and Adorno argue that mass-produced entertainment aims, by its very nature, to appeal to vast audiences and therefore both the intellectual stimulation of high art and the basic release of low art. The essay does not suggest that all products of this system are inherently inferior, simply that they have replaced other forms of entertainment without properly fulfilling the important roles played by the now defunct sources of culture.|$|R
40|$|Firms {{frequently}} offer refunds, both when physical {{products are}} returned and when service contracts are terminated prematurely. We show how refunds {{act as a}} "metering device" when consumers learn about their personal valuation while experimenting with the product or service. Our theory predicts that low-quality firms offer inefficiently strict terms for refunds, while high-quality firms offer inefficiently generous terms. This may help to explain the observed variety in contractual terms. As in our model strict cancellation terms and low refunds are used to price discriminate, rather than to trap consumers into purchasing <b>inferior</b> <b>products,</b> {{the imposition of a}} statutory minimum refund policy would not, in general, improve consumer surplus or welfare. ...|$|R

40|$|M. Comm. Du Plessis (1993 : 649) {{states that}} the most common reasons for {{business}} failure are the {{lack of understanding of}} the market and <b>inferior</b> <b>products.</b> The first point in Timmons' criteria list focuses on the industry and market. This is of utmost importance as no correct analysis of a new venture's viability can be done if there is not a full understanding by the potential investor of the exact market that he/she intends to venture into. Timmons does not highlight the importance of the product as such in his criteria list although <b>inferior</b> <b>products</b> {{are one of the most}} common reasons for failure. Timmons' fatal flaw aspect, point six, is however very important as it is an "abort checkpoint". If the venture has a fatal flaw, regardless of everything else being perfect, it could cancel the potential venture. This fatal flaw aspect is in line with Cartland's "subjective determination" criteria. Various probabilities are difficult or impossible to quantify accurately. If the entrepreneur is not totally convinced of the probability of success, it should be seen as a fatal flaw and the venture abandoned. Timmons' list of eight criteria is seen to incorporate the broadest and most appropriate checklist. Chapter three will concentrate on the industry, market and product in more detail, thus ensuring a thorough understanding of the market and product, avoiding one of the weaknesses in Timmons' criteria. In chapter four the business opportunity for echinoderms in South Africa will be evaluated against the eight factors as outlined especially by Timmons in this chapter...|$|R
50|$|Component {{localization}} targets, set {{to encourage}} {{creation of a}} local supply chain, exacerbated tensions. They were met late if at all, and while the French initially profited from parts sales, Chinese consumers saw increased component localization from inexperienced suppliers lead to <b>inferior</b> <b>products.</b> In spite of Chinese resistance, Peugeot repatriated profits, and cultural conflicts continued throughout. By 1993, a soured Peugeot saw its now-inferior models out-completed by better offerings with sales dropping to 2,544 while competing Shanghai VW built no less than 146,000 cars—fifty percent of the overall market. By 1996, the Guangzhou government decided it no longer wanted a French foreign partner. Peugeot removed itself in 1997, and Guangzhou Automotive chose to begin a new joint venture with Honda.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{order for}} bait matrices, treated wood and {{resistant}} wood species to be properly evaluated {{in the laboratory}} for termite resistance or palatability, reliable tests that can distinguish between food choices must be developed; otherwise, <b>inferior</b> <b>products</b> may enter the marketplace. In the current study, a bioassay method is proposed that allows the calculation of two new feeding indexes, a Wood Resistance Index (WRI) and a Termite Preference Index (TPI). These indexes incorporate the feeding behavior of termites in both choice and no-choice situations. In tests using Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar), the WRI consistently provided statistically significant comparisons between three wood species: pine, water oak and red cedar. The TPI and WRI, though not without limitations, convey more information than other common measures of feeding...|$|R
