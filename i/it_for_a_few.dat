This {{meant that it}} generally performed well during the campaign in Greece in April 1941. After {{the conclusion of the}} fighting in Greece, he refused to join in the criticism directed by some senior officers of the 2nd New Zealand Division at Freyberg's leadership during the battle. He later fought in Operation Crusader, the campaign to lift the Siege of Tobruk. At one point in the battle, his brigade captured elements of the headquarters of the Afrika Korps. However, he was impetuous in his efforts to capture Point 175, a strategically important hill to the south of Tobruk, and this led to heavy losses in one of the battalions of his brigade. Although Point 175 was seized, Barrowclough's brigade was only able to hold <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days before being forced to withdraw due to German attacks. He received a Bar to his DSO for his leadership during the Crusader offensive, having already been awarded the Greek War Cross and a mention in despatches for his work in Greece.|$|E

He became desperate to buy 30 Jetliners, but Avro had to repeatedly turn him down due to limited manufacturing capabilities and overwork on the CF-100 project. Hughes then started looking at US companies to build it for them; Convair proved interested and started studies on gearing up a production line. C.D. Howe again stepped in and insisted that Avro concentrate on its Orenda turbojet and CF-100 jet fighter programs.|$|E

Mulattos and blacks again rose up against these French in October 1802 and finally defeated them in November 1803. On 1 January 1804 the victors declared Saint-Domingue to be the independent republic of Haiti. Even after their defeat by the Haitians, a small French garrison remained in Santo Domingo. Slavery was reestablished and many of the émigré Spanish colonists returned. In 1805, after crowning himself Emperor, Jean-Jacques Dessalines invaded, reaching Santo Domingo before retreating {{in the face of a}} French naval squadron. In their retreat through the Cibao, the Haitians sacked the towns of Santiago and Moca, slaughtering most of their residents and helping to lay the foundation for two centuries of animosity between the two countries.|$|E
500|$|The {{discovery}} of nuclear fission by Otto Hahn in December 1938 (and its theoretical explanation by Lise Meitner) generated intense interest among physicists. Bohr brought {{the news to}} the United States where he opened the Fifth Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics with Fermi on 26 January 1939. When Bohr told George Placzek that this resolved all the mysteries of transuranic elements, Placzek told him that one remained: the neutron capture energies of uranium did not match those of its decay. Bohr thought about <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> minutes and then announced to Placzek, Léon Rosenfeld and John Wheeler that [...] "I have understood everything." [...] Based on his liquid drop model of the nucleus, Bohr concluded {{that it was the}} uranium-235 isotope and not the more abundant uranium-238 that was primarily responsible for fission with thermal neutrons. In April 1940, John R. Dunning demonstrated that Bohr was correct. In the meantime, Bohr and Wheeler developed a theoretical treatment which they published in a September 1939 paper on [...] "The Mechanism of Nuclear Fission".|$|E

[...] Even when it's difficult to keep track of the myriad connections, a sense lingers that somebody knows—which is strangely reassuring." [...] Despite being more interested in the romantic aspirations of the show's characters, Jennifer Godwin of E! remarked that [...] "the Lost mythology is a miracle to behold. [...] It's grandiose, compelling, gaspworthy and, despite what the haters would have you believe, altogether satisfying". [...] Katherine Nichols of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin enjoyed the opening scene, [...] "but the rest of it didn't capture [...] as [...] hoped it would", citing high expectations due to the eight-month hiatus after the fourth season finale and a possible [...] "yearning for more character-driven stories over machinations revolving around time travel, however clever they might be."
