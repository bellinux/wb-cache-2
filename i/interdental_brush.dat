40|$|Purpose: Periodontitis {{generally}} initiates in the interdental area, where biofilm {{development is}} difficult to interrupt. Mechanical cleaning with <b>interdental</b> <b>brushes</b> (IDB) offers an effective method for plaque control and prevents gingivitis and periodontitis. This study aimed to determine whether mechanical cleaning with <b>interdental</b> <b>brushes</b> combined {{with the use of}} cetylpyridinium chloride (0. 3 % CPC) gel was more effective at plaque control compared with mechanical cleaning with <b>interdental</b> <b>brushes</b> alone. Materials and Methods: Forty individuals (30 - 70 years) with at least 20 teeth and moderate chronic periodontitis who had no experience with interdental cleaning aids were randomly assigned to a treatment group (brush + gel, n = 20) or a control group (brush, n = 20). Both groups were examined by a dentist at baseline and at 3 and 6 months for changes in interdental plaque [interproximal plaque index (API) ] levels, gingival inflammation [sulcus bleeding index (SBI) ], probing depth (PD), and bleeding on probing (BOP). Results: No baseline differences in age, gender, or number of teeth were observed between the two groups. During the study period, improvements in API and BOP were comparable between groups. However, improvements in SBI and PD were significantly greater in the test group than in the control group (P = 0. 046 and P = 0. 029, respectively).

The aim {{of the study is}} to evaluate the periodontal health expressed by clinical indices in patients under orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances, according to different oral hygene maintenance programs. Material and method: We performed a randomized prospective study on 60 patients with fixed {{orthodontic appliances}} (17 - 25 years of age) devided in three study groups. The clnical indices recorded were: modified gingival index, plaque index and sulcular bleeding index. Statistical analysis or the results were carried out using Student t test. Results: The patients were randomly divided into three groups: group A-patients were instructed to use electric brush, water flosser and <b>interdental</b> <b>brush,</b> group B- electric brush, <b>interdental</b> <b>brush</b> and fluoride and group C- manual brushing and fluoride. Statistical comparison of the values of the indexes with the Student t test for independent samples showed statistically significant differences in all three groups of patients studied between initial and final values of all recorded clinical parameters.

40|$|Although {{dental health}} has {{improved}} {{during the last}} 40 - 50 years, approximal caries still constitutes a problem in many age groups. It is important that fluoride (F) toothpaste is used when brushing the teeth. In some subjects, {{there may be a}} need for supplementary F products, especially in the caries-prone approximal area. Aim: The aims of this thesis were: i) to study the F release of F-containing approximal oral hygiene aids both in vitro and in vivo, ii) to evaluate different methods for the administration of F in vivo, iii) to study the effect of the frequent use of F-containing toothpicks and floss on demineralised enamel and dentine in situ and iv) to evaluate recommendations and the use of oral hygiene products for approximal cleaning in a Swedish adult population. Material and methods and Results: The F release of 26 brands of toothpicks and floss was followed for 24 hrs in vitro. A large variation in the release between these products was found; in general, toothpicks resulted in larger amounts of F compared with floss. The release in vivo was studied using single and multiple fluoridated toothpicks and dental floss, as well as in combination with toothbrushing or a mouthrinse with 0. 2 % NaF. Moreover, the administration of F by an <b>interdental</b> <b>brush</b> dipped in 0. 2 % NaF gel (here called the “Inter Dental Brush Gel Method”) was evaluated. Approximal saliva was collected, using paper points, before and up to 60 min after treatment. Both toothpicks and floss resulted in enhanced F concentrations in vivo. An <b>interdental</b> <b>brush</b> dipped in 0. 2 % NaF gel and a mouthrinse with 0. 2 % NaF resulted in the same F concentration as after using multiple toothpicks. All combinations of toothpicks and dental floss with F rinsing resulted in higher concentrations than after only toothbrushing or in combination with brushing. The most optimal order was to use toothpicks and dental floss after toothbrushing and before rinsing. Fifteen adults with full dentures, in which demineralised enamel and dentine specimens had been mounted, were included in an in situ experimental caries model. Toothpicks or floss, impregnated with NaF and amine fluoride (AmF), were used regularly for four weeks. All the products inhibited continuous demineralisation - dental floss somewhat more than toothpicks. A reduction in plaque micro-organisms was also found. Recommendations made by dental staff in relation to approximal cleaning aids were evaluated by a questionnaire sent to 500 dentists, 500 dental hygienists and 1000 patients in Sweden. The ability to remove approximal plaque was also evaluated in 60 regular users of approximal aids. Recommendations by dental staff are mostly given to children and adolescents in order to prevent dental caries and to older individuals to prevent gingivitis and periodontal disease. Approximal plaque appears to be more easily removed by regular users of interdental brushes compared with the use of toothpicks and dental floss. Conclusions: The use of fluoridated interproximal aids appears to be important in order to reduce approximal caries. An <b>interdental</b> <b>brush</b> dipped in a NaF gel is an interesting method for increasing approximal F concentration...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the efficacy of}} 4 different oral hygiene regimens involving adjunctive interdental cleaning devices in unsupervised young subjects with intact interdental papilla. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty periodontally healthy subjects were randomly allocated to 4 groups following different oral hygiene regimens (T- 7) : use of manual toothbrush alone; manual toothbrush plus dental floss; manual toothbrush plus interdental brushes; and manual toothbrush plus rubber interdental picks. Oral hygiene instructions (OHI) were given. One week after (T 0), professional supragingival scaling and polishing was performed, and subjects were then reseen every 2 weeks (T 14 and T 28). At T- 7, T 0, T 14 and T 28, full-mouth plaque score (FMPS), full-mouth bleeding score (FMBS) and angulated bleeding index (AngBI) were taken. RESULTS: During the first week (T- 7 /T 0 unclean phase), FMPS decreased significantly in all groups except the group using dental floss. At T 28, {{a significant decrease in}} FMPS (P <. 001, all groups) and FMBS (P <. 05, all groups except the group using flossing P <. 001) was noted. Interdental FMPS showed significantly lower values in subjects treated with <b>interdental</b> <b>brushes</b> or rubber <b>interdental</b> picks vs toothbrushing alone (P <. 05). The use of interdental picks was associated with reduced interdental FMBS when compared to flossing (P <. 05).

Of the 2, 408 out of 2, 608 sites, the overall accessibility prevalence of any interdental brushing was 92. 3 %. In total, 80. 6 % of the sites required interdental brushes with smaller diameters (0. 6 - 0. 7 mm).

40|$|BACKGROUND, AIMS: Previous studies {{indicated}} that oral hygiene aids {{can play a}} rôle in the intra-oral translocation of pathogens. The survival rate of cariogenic and periodontopathogenic species on toothbrushes, with and without toothpaste, and interdental brushes was presently investigated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 12 periodontitis patients had their interdental spaces professionally cleaned with interdental brushes and their teeth with new toothbrushes with or without different dentifrices. Each time brushes were rinsed with tap water and stored dry at room temperature. At different time intervals an <b>interdental</b> <b>brush</b> or 4 tufts from a toothbrush were processed for vitality staining and selective and non-selective culturing procedures. RESULTS: Immediately after rinsing, a toothbrush without toothpaste harboured 10 (7), 10 (8) and 10 (7) colony forming units (CFU) of respectively aerobic, anaerobic and black pigmented species. An insignificant decrease occurred the first 24 hours and after 48 hours still 10 (4) CFU of aerobic and anaerobic species could be cultured. No periodontopathogen remained detectable at 8 hours, except for Fusobacterium nucleatum. The proportion of vital bacteria decreased in 48 hours from 50 % to 30 %. Comparable results were obtained for interdental brushes. The bacterial survival rate on toothbrushes was significantly reduced {{by the use of}} a detergent containing toothpaste by 2 log at baseline, another 2 log at 4 hours and an extra log more at 8 hours for aerobic and anaerobic species.

Orthodontic {{treatment}} {{enables the}} establishment of functional occlusion and improvement of oral health, however, it {{increases the risk of}} periodontal disease development. The aim of this paper was to examine the efficiency of the applied programme for the prevention of gingivitis in children undergoing the fixed orthodontic appliance therapy and to determine the most efficient devices and techniques for maintaining oral hygiene during orthodontic treatment. Methods. The study included 80 patients of both genders - 60 patients comprised the experimental group and 20 patients comprised the control group. All of them were patients of the Clinic for Orthodontics at the School of Dentistry in Belgrade, aged between 13 and 18. The Silness-Löe Plaque Index (PI) was utilised for the assessment of oral hygiene quality and Silness-Löe Gingival Index (GI) and Mühlemann Papilla Bleeding Index (PBI) were utilised for the assessment of gingival state. Checkups were conducted as a single-blind study at the beginning and after the first, the third and the sixth month of the preventive and prophylactic programme. Results. During the observed period, a statistically significant change in PI, GI and PBI values was noticed (p < 0. 005), as well as the difference in the dynamics of value changes during the periods between the observed groups. Conclusion. The preventive programme, applied to children undergoing the fixed orthodontic appliance therapy, had a positive effect both on oral hygiene quality and gingival state.
