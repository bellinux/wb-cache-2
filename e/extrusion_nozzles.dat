TiN {{has been}} used in {{numerous}} technological applications including: cutting or milling tools and inserts, cold <b>extrusion</b> <b>nozzles</b> and punches, forming or stamping tools, and diffusion barrier. It is currendy deposited from an initial gas mixture composed of hydrogen, ammonia and titanium tetrachloride. This paper reports on the optimization of its deposition conditions at atmospheric pressure. A complete factorial design with three factors and two levels, thus requiring 2 ^= 8 experiments, has been carried out. The following parameters were selected: the deposition temperature, the molar fraction of titanium tetrachloride and the molar fraction of ammonia. The influence of these factors on die deposition rate, the grain size estimated by die Scherrer method and the texture coefficient as determined by X-ray diffraction were studied. The mechanical properties of the coatings (microhardness, Young's modulus) were measured by depm-sensing indentation. 1...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe present paper {{describes}} {{preliminary results}} {{on the development of}} a batch lab-scale co-extrusion device for the production of alginate beads as carrier for hydrophilic compounds. A dual jet of liquid core (aqueous solution of glucose or vitamin B 12 or olive oil) and liquid shell material (aqueous solution of alginates differing for guluronic to mannuronic ratio) was pumped through concentric <b>extrusion</b> <b>nozzles</b> and droplets were formed by means of a rotating fluid jet cutter. The shell of the bead was then hardened in the hardening bath containing a calcium chloride solution. Optimization of the co-extrusion plant accounts for the management of the operative conditions within the hardening unit (incubation time, molarity of the gelling agent), and for the control of the surface-tension-driven breakup of laminar jets which was managed by varying the jet cutter - hardening unit distance. Beads enriched in vitamin B 12, that were formed according to the best plant set-up, were tested for the bioactive release when stressed under thermal conditions simulating typical dairy products processes. Cyanocobalamin was retained at all...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{cyanobacterium}} Mastigocladus laminosus forms hormogonia, which glide slowly {{away from}} the parent colony by extruding slime out of nozzles. Using video microscopy, we observed hormogonia embedded in and moving through 1 – 4 % agar solutions with an average velocity of 0. 5 μm/s. Agar is non-Newtonian and is subject to shear-thinning so that its viscosity greatly increases at low shear rates. We measured the viscosity of these agar solutions at the very low shear rates appropriate for gliding hormogonia and found it to vary from 1 to 52 million centipoise. Then, by applying a Newtonian drag coefficient for a 100 -μm-long, cigar-shaped hormogonium, we found that it produced a force of several million pN. A typical hormogonium has 10 – 100 thousand 9 -nm-wide slime <b>extrusion</b> <b>nozzles.</b> Wolgemuth et al. have proposed hydration-driven swelling of the polyelectrolyte slime ejected from these nozzles as the force production mechanism, and our experiment found a large nozzle force that was consistent with this hypothesis. Average single nozzle force depended on viscosity, being large when the viscosity was high: 71 pN in 3 % and 126 pN in 4 % agar...|$|E

40|$|About {{a fourth}} {{of the people in}} the world suffer from anemia. The most major and {{effective}} ways of reducing anemia and iron deficiency in the society are iron fortification of food and improving the iron absorption. In this method a certain amount of iron in the form of capsulation is added to the food ingredients which are the main food of the people and are eaten every day. Encapsulation will decrease undesirable changes and iron interaction with the other food ingredients, moreover can usefully affects the bioavailability of iron. The present study describes iron fortification of hydrated and dehydrated food products in which ferric saccharate is as a core and calcium alginate is as a capsule coating. To evaluate the performance range, time and size of the microcapsules, the dispersion method was compared in three ways of <b>extrusion</b> with <b>nozzle,</b> <b>extrusion</b> with needle and emulsion.

40|$|Layered {{manufacturing}} inherently {{suffers from}} staircase defects along surfaces that are gently slopped {{with respect to}} the build direction. Reducing the slice thickness improves the situation but never resolves it completely as flat layers remain a poor approximation of the true surface in these regions. In addition, reducing the slice thickness largely increases the print time. In this work we focus on a simple yet effective technique to improve the print accuracy for layered manufacturing by filament deposition. Our method works with standard three-axis 3 D filament printers (e. g. the typical, widely available 3 D printers), using standard <b>extrusion</b> <b>nozzles.</b> It better reproduces the geometry of sloped surfaces without increasing the print time. Our key idea is to perform a local anti-aliasing, working at a sub-layer accuracy to produce slightly curved deposition paths and reduce approximation errors. This is inspired by Computer Graphics anti-aliasing techniques which consider sub-pixel precision to treat aliasing effects. We show that the necessary deviation in height compared to standard slicing is bounded by half the layer thickness. Therefore, the height changes remain small and plastic deposition remains reliable. We further split and order paths to minimize defects due to the extruder nozzle shape, avoiding any change to the existing hardware. We apply and analyze our approach on 3 D printed examples, showing that our technique greatly improves surface accuracy and silhouette quality while keeping the print time nearly identical.

40|$|This {{research}} utilises a Fused Deposition Modelling 3 D Printer {{to investigate}} the aesthetics of 3 D printing and it's broader applications. The presented research re-evaluates the 3 D printer {{as a tool to}} manipulate materials, as opposed to a machine that discretely reproduces digital models at a fine resolution. The research questions the utility of automation, and attempts to find a level that permits materially expressive modes of fabrication. The exploration of aesthetics has uncovered a variety of unexpected textures and interesting material properties that may have wider use. For instance, rigid plastic has been extruded and manipulated finer than the <b>extrusion</b> <b>nozzle</b> diameter, which confers flexibility and fabric like qualities to the printed object.

Scaffolds supports cell adhesion as a temporary extracellular matrix, which plays a key role in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Hydrogel 3 D structure bio-fabrication was an important step towards cell 3 D printing. A precision <b>extrusion</b> <b>nozzle</b> based on ball screw transmission was developed for porous hydrogel fabrication. The whole bio-fabrication temperature was controlled between 4 - 14 degrees C which eliminates ice exactly.

40|$|Fused {{deposition}} modeling (FDM) is an {{additive manufacturing}} (AM) {{process that has}} been used in various manufacturing fields. However, the drawback of FDM is poor surface finish of part produced, leading to surface roughness and requires hand finishing.

However, very little research regarding the application of ultrasound to AM has been carried out. Our previous research found that the <b>extrusion</b> <b>nozzle</b> of the FDM system could withstand the high vibration transmitted at 40 kHz of frequency from an ultrasonic transducer.

40|$|An {{inherent}} difficulty {{associated with}} the application of suitable bioscaffolds for tissue engineering is the incorporation of adequate mechanical characteristics into the materials which recapitulate that of the native tissue, whilst maintaining cell proliferation and nutrient transfer qualities. Biomaterial composites fabricated using rapid prototyping techniques can potentially improve the functionality and patient-specific processing of tissue engineering scaffolds. In this work, a technique for the coaxial melt extrusion printing of core-shell scaffold structures was designed, implemented and assessed {{with respect to the}} repeatability, cell efficacy and scaffold porosity obtainable. Encapsulated alginate hydrogel/thermoplastic polycaprolactone (Alg-PCL) cofibre scaffolds were fabricated. Selective laser melting was used to produce a high resolution stainless steel 316 L coaxial <b>extrusion</b> <b>nozzle,</b> exhibiting diameters of 300 ?m/ 900 ?m for the inner and outer nozzles respectively. We present coaxial melt extrusion printed scaffolds of Alg-PCL cofibres with ? 0. 4 volume fraction alginate, with total fibre diameter as low as 600 ?m and core material offset as low as 10 % of the total diameter. Furthermore the tuneability of scaffold porosity, pore size and interconnectivity, as well as the preliminary inclusion, compatibility and survival of an L- 929 mouse fibroblast cell-line within the scaffolds were explored.

40|$|Hollow fibers find useful {{applications}} in different disciplines like fluid transport and purification, optical guidance, and composite reinforcement. In tissue engineering, {{they can be}} used to direct tissue in-growth or to serve as drug delivery depots. The fabrication techniques currently available, however, do not allow to simultaneously organize them into three-dimensional (3 D) matrices, thus adding further functionality to approach more complicated or hierarchical structures. We report here the development of a novel technology to fabricate hollow fibers with controllable hollow cavity diameter and shell thickness. By exploiting viscous encapsulation, a rheological phenomenon often undesired in molten polymeric blends flowing through narrow ducts, fibers with a shell–core configuration can be extruded. Hollow fibers are then obtained by selective dissolution of the inner core polymer. The hollow cavity diameter and the shell thickness can be controlled by varying the polymers in the blend, the blend composition, and the <b>extrusion</b> <b>nozzle</b> diameter. Simultaneous with extrusion, the extrudates are organized into 3 D matrices with different architectures and custom-made shapes by 3 D fiber deposition, a rapid prototyping tool which has recently been applied for the production of scaffolds for tissue engineering purposes. Applications in tissue engineering and controlled drug delivery of these constructs are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Fused {{deposition}} modeling (FDM) is an Additive Manufacturing (AM) {{process that}} has an economical advantage compared to other AM processes. However, its biggest drawback is that it requires post processing to achieve a good surface finish. Ultrasound has been applied in various conventional machining processes and produce good surface finish. However, the application of ultrasound to AM has not been sufficiently explored. This research aim to investigate the application of using ultrasound technology for a desktop FDM system. The idea is to transmit high vibration from the ultrasonic transducer to the FDM system's nozzle and {{the objective is to}} examine whether the nozzle is able to withstand the high vibration being transmitted. A Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software used to develop the 3 D model of the <b>extrusion</b> <b>nozzle</b> component and a Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) software was used to perform static and vibration analysis. A frequency range of 20 kHz to 30 kHz and 30 kHz to 40 kHz was applied to the nozzle and {{it was found that the}} nozzle was able to withstand frequencies up to 40 kHz of vibration. In addition, the lowest Factor of Safety (FoS) obtained was 18. 8975, concluding that the nozzle of FDM can withstand the high vibration transmitted from the ultrasonic transducer...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} {{popularity of}} Additive Fabrication (AF) processing techniques {{in recent years}} has catalysed its application {{in a wide range of}} research disciplines. The use of Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) as a technique for the synthesis of functional biomaterial scaffolds for tissue engineering implants epitomises the level of specialisation, as well as the diversity in application, that is possible through the utilisation of an additive approach. While these scaffolds can provide ideal cellular interfaces and be impregnated with growth factors and electrically conducting nanomaterials, the processing itself provides only minimal flexibility with respect to the number of composite materials which can be implemented to reach these targets of function. In this work, a method for the Coaxial Melt Extrusion Printing (CMEP) of multifunctional, conductive and biocompatible co-fibres is presented. This allows for the coupling of two materials into an encapsulated core and shell configuration, and their subsequent extrusion into complex scaffold and path-oriented architectures. Selective Laser Melting was implemented to produce a high resolution stainless steel 316 L coaxial <b>extrusion</b> <b>nozzle,</b> exhibiting diameters of 300 m/ 900 m for the inner and outer nozzles respectively.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to develop a new 3 D {{printing}} food constructs based on lemon juice gel system. We investigated the effect of potato starch (10, 12. 5, 15, 17. 5 and 20 g/ 100 g) on the rheological properties and mechanical properties of lemon juice gels. Besides, the influence of printing parameters (nozzle height, <b>nozzle</b> diameter, <b>extrusion</b> rate and <b>nozzle</b> movement speed) on the quality of printed products were also studied. The results show that it is suitable to make the size of the nozzle height the same with that of the nozzle diameter, which could not be regarded as a key factor that affects print quality.

In this printing system, the 1 mm nozzle diameter, 24 mm/s extrusion rate and 30 mm/s nozzle movement speed were found to be the optimal parameters to print 3 D constructs matching the target geometry with fine resolution, more smooth surface texture, and fewer point defects with no compressed deformation...|$|R

This technology consists in the additive multilayer deposition of a UV-curable resin for the fabrication of 3 D macro structures and microstructures of arbitrary shapes. A systematic investigation {{on the effect of}} filler concentration on the rheological properties of the polymer-based nanocomposites was performed. In particular, the rheological characterization of these nanocomposites allowed to identify the optimal printability parameters for these systems based on the shear rate of the materials at the <b>extrusion</b> <b>nozzle.</b> In addition, photocalorimetric measurements were used to assess the effect of the presence of the inorganic fillers on the thermodynamics and kinetics of the photocuring process of the resins. By direct deposition of homogeneous solvent-free nanocomposite dispersions of different fillers in a UV-curable polymeric resin, the effect of UV- 3 D printing direction, fill density, and fill pattern on the mechanical properties of UV- 3 D printed specimens was investigated by means of uniaxial tensile tests.

40|$|Synthetic {{bone graft}} is {{commonly}} used in trauma and reconstructive surgery to facilitate anatomic restoration of bone fragments including joint surfaces. Migration of the synthetic or human derived bone graft material from the desired location is a frequently encountered clinical complication contributing to surgery failure. The purpose of this research work {{is to develop a}} 3 D printed bone graft which integrates directly with a locking plate fracture fixation system, as such the graft is rigidly held and able to resist applied forces and thus not migrate. Furthermore the fabrication technique allows precise control of porosity which is known to be critical in cellular migration and resorption. Whilst additive manufacturing (AM) processes are well known for reproducing the shape of a biomaterial from, for example, CT data they are less well known for their ability to reproduce compositional and potentially microstructural design from a computer file. Extrusion freeforming was used in this project to make synthetic bone grafts with multi-scale porosity and fixation feature. An extrusion-based three dimensional (3 D) printer was designed and established which produces a graft, enabling direct integration with a fracture fixation/stabilisation system via a customised region in the synthetic bone graft. The developed 3 D printer has proven highly reliable in the generation of latticed 3 D structures and can process a wide range of biomaterials with reproducibility, flexibility at low cost. In this fabrication process, a continuous flow of materials in the form of biomaterial paste is dispensed sequentially using a 3 D motion system incorporated with the <b>extrusion</b> <b>nozzle</b> to form a 3 D complex object. The additive nature of the developed 3 D printer ensures minimal waste of bio-material and provides a platform for mass production of biomedical lattice structures. The main feature and focus of the developed 3 D bio-printer is the ability to generate porous bioactive 3 D structures containing highly uniform interconnected pores with precise control of porosity and filament size. Optimal porosity and filament size have been identified through in-vitro investigation alongside positive results showing cell adhesion, proliferation and viability. An optimized 3 D printed integrated bone graft was placed within a chick femoral defect and implanted subcutaneously in a mouse to evaluate efficiency of the proposed approach for bone fixation. Following 28 days implantation the mouse was euthanized and the device retrieved.

40|$|This thesis investigates solid {{freeform}} fabrication of biological materials for dental restoration and orthopedic implant applications. The basic approach in this study for {{solid freeform}} fabrication of biological materials is micro-extrusion of single or multiple slurries for 3 D components and inkjet color printing of multiple suspensions for functionally graded materials (FGMs). Common issues associated with micro-extrusion and inkjet color printing are investigated. These common issues include (i) formulation of stable slurries with a pseudoplastic property, (ii) cross-sectional geometry of the extrudate {{as a function of}} the extrusion parameters, (iii) fabrication path optimization for extrusion process, (iv) extrusion optimization for multi-layer components, (v) composition control in functionally graded materials, and (vi) sintering optimization to convert the freeform fabricated powder compact to a dense body for biological applications. ^ The present study clearly shows that the rheological and extrusion behavior of dental porcelain slurries depend strongly on the pH value of the slurry and extrusion conditions. A slurry with pseudoplastic properties is a basic requirement for obtaining extruded lines with rectangular cross-sections. The cross-sectional geometry of the extrudate is also strongly affected by extrusion parameters including the <b>extrusion</b> <b>nozzle</b> height, <b>nozzle</b> moving speed, <b>extrusion</b> rate, and critical nozzle height. Proper combinations of these extrusion parameters are necessary in order to obtain single line extrudates with near rectangular cross-sections and 3 D objects with dimensional accuracy, uniform wall thickness, good wall uprightness, and no wall slumping. Based on these understandings, single-wall, multi-wall, and solid teeth have been fabricated via micro-extrusion of the dental slurry directly from a CAD digital model in 30 min. ^ Inkjet color printing using stable Al 2 O 3 and ZrO 2 aqueous suspensions has been developed to fabricate functionally graded materials. The volume and composition of the suspensions printed in droplets at a small area are controlled by the inkjet Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Black color printing principle. The potential of this newly-developed method for fabricating FGMs with arbitrarily designed three-dimensional composition profiles is demonstrated. ^ Sintering investigation focuses on dental porcelain and hydroxyapatite (HA) bodies. Proper sintering conditions have been established for dental porcelain bodies to maintain dimensional accuracy and to prevent slumping. For sintering of HA bodies, a novel approach for sintering of HA bodies at temperatures as low as 900 °C has been developed. Low temperature sintering of HA bodies is critical for the success of fabricating functionally graded HA/Ti- 6 Al- 4 V materials for orthopedic implant applications because co-sintering of HA and Ti- 4 Al- 4 V at temperatures above 950 °C can result in the formation of soluble tricalcium phosphate and severe oxidation of Ti- 6 Al 4 V. The low temperature sintering of nanocrystalline HA developed in this study, based on the morphology driven anisotropic crystal coarsening mechanism, opens up the opportunity to fabricate functionally graded HA/Ti- 6 Al- 4 V materials with no decomposition of HA and oxidation of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and to improve the quality of HA coatings on Ti alloys. ...|$|R

2500|$|Some methods melt or {{soften the}} {{material}} to produce the layers. In Fused filament fabrication, also known as Fused deposition modeling (FDM), the model or part is produced by extruding small beads or streams of material which harden immediately to form layers. A filament of thermoplastic, metal wire, or other material is fed into an <b>extrusion</b> <b>nozzle</b> head (3D printer extruder), which heats the material and turns the flow on and off. FDM is somewhat restricted in the variation of shapes that may be fabricated. Another technique fuses parts of the layer and then moves upward in the working area, adding another layer of granules and repeating the process until the piece has built up. This process uses the unfused media to support overhangs and thin walls in the part being produced, which reduces the need for temporary auxiliary supports for the piece. Laser sintering techniques include selective laser sintering, with both metals and polymers, and direct metal laser sintering. Selective laser melting does not use sintering for the fusion of powder granules but will completely melt the powder using a high-energy laser to create fully dense materials in a layer-wise method that has mechanical properties {{similar to those of}} conventional manufactured metals. Electron beam melting is a similar type of additive manufacturing technology for metal parts (e.g. titanium alloys). EBM manufactures parts by melting metal powder layer by layer with an electron beam in a high vacuum. Another method consists of an inkjet 3D printing system, which creates the model one layer at a time by spreading a layer of powder (plaster, or resins) and printing a binder in the cross-section of the part using an inkjet-like process. With laminated object manufacturing, thin layers are cut to shape and joined together. [...] Other methods cure liquid materials using different sophisticated technologies, such as stereolithography. Photopolymerization is primarily used in stereolithography to produce a solid part from a liquid. Inkjet printer systems like the Objet PolyJet system spray photopolymer materials onto a build tray in ultra-thin layers (between 16 and 30µm) until the part is completed. Each photopolymer layer is cured with UV light after it is jetted, producing fully cured models that can be handled and used immediately, without post-curing. Ultra-small features can be made with the 3D micro-fabrication technique used in multiphoton photopolymerisation. Due to the nonlinear nature of photo excitation, the gel is cured to a solid only in the places where the laser was focused while the remaining gel is then washed away. Feature sizes of under 100nm are easily produced, as well as complex structures with moving and interlocked parts. Yet another approach uses a synthetic resin that is solidified using LEDs. In Mask-image-projection-based stereolithography, a 3D digital model is sliced by a set of horizontal planes. Each slice is converted into a two-dimensional mask image. The mask image is then projected onto a photocurable liquid resin surface and light is projected onto the resin to cure it {{in the shape of the}} layer. Continuous liquid interface production begins with a pool of liquid photopolymer resin. Part of the pool bottom is transparent to ultraviolet light (the [...] "window"), which causes the resin to solidify. The object rises slowly enough to allow resin to flow under and maintain contact with the bottom of the object. [...] In powder-fed directed-energy deposition, a high-power laser is used to melt metal powder supplied to the focus of the laser beam. The powder fed directed energy process is similar to Selective Laser Sintering, but the metal powder is applied only where material is being added to the part at that moment.|$|R

40|$|BackgroundMany microorganisms, {{including}} myxobacteria, cyanobacteria, and flexibacteria, move by gliding. Although gliding always {{describes a}} slow surface-associated translocation {{in the direction}} of the cell's long axis, it can result from two very different propulsion mechanisms: social (S) motility and adventurous (A) motility. The force for S motility is generated by retraction of type 4 pili. A motility may be associated with the extrusion of slime, but evidence has been lacking, and how force might be generated has remained an enigma. Recently, nozzle-like structures were discovered in cyanobacteria from which slime emanated at the same rate at which the bacteria moved. This strongly implicates slime extrusion as a propulsion mechanism for gliding. ResultsHere we show that similar but smaller nozzle-like structures are found in Myxococcus xanthus and that they are clustered at both cell poles, where one might expect propulsive organelles. Furthermore, light and electron microscopical observations show that slime is secreted in ribbons from the ends of cells. To test whether the slime propulsion hypothesis is physically reasonable, we construct a mathematical model of the slime nozzle to see if it can generate a force sufficient to propel M. xanthus at the observed velocities. The model assumes that the hydration of slime, a cationic polyelectrolyte, is the force-generating mechanism. ConclusionsThe discovery of nozzle-like organelles in various gliding bacteria suggests their role in prokaryotic gliding. Our calculations and our observations of slime trails demonstrate that slime <b>extrusion</b> from such <b>nozzles</b> can account for most of the observed properties of A motile gliding...|$|R
