5|$|One morning, after Tod's {{escape from}} the greyhounds, the Master sends Copper on the hunt. After {{he picks up the}} fox's trail, Copper relentlessly pursues him {{throughout}} the day and into the next morning. Tod finally drops dead of exhaustion, and Copper collapses on top of him, close to death himself. The Master nurses Copper back to health, and both enjoy their new popularity, but after a few months the excitement over Copper's accomplishment dies down. The Master is left alone again, and returns to drinking. He is once again asked to consider living in a nursing home, and this time he agrees. Crying, he takes his shotgun from the wall, leads Copper outside, and pets <b>him</b> <b>gently</b> before ordering him to lie down. He covers the dog's eyes as Copper licks his hand trustingly.|$|E
25|$|Robert Payne quotes Muawiyah in History of Islam as {{telling his}} son Yazid to defeat Hussein, who was surely {{preparing}} an army against him, but {{to deal with}} <b>him</b> <b>gently</b> thereafter as Hussein was a descendent of Muhammad; but to deal with Abdullah al-Zubair swiftly, as Muawiyah feared him the most.|$|E
25|$|In the Second Task of the Tournament, Ron is {{the person}} {{selected}} for Harry to rescue {{from the depths of}} the Hogwarts Lake, as he is the one whom Harry would most miss. Harry successfully saves him and Ron mocks <b>him</b> <b>gently</b> for thinking that the hostages for the task were in actual danger.|$|E

60|$|Midwinter put <b>him</b> back <b>gently</b> {{into his}} chair, {{and drew a}} seat near to it for himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "To Sir Bingo, Captain MacTurk, I have no {{apology to}} offer--I think I treated <b>him</b> more <b>gently</b> than his {{impertinence}} deserved." ...|$|R
25|$|Gay actor Martin Kurath (Prochnow) who is {{in prison}} {{develops}} a friendship with Thomas Manzoni (Hannawald), the 15-year-old son of the prison warden (Lüönd). The two {{fall in love and}} they both yearn for Kurath's release. This triggers intense indignation in their surroundings. After Kurath is released a year later, Thomas accompanied by Kurath, tells his parents he is a homosexual. His father tells him to leave and never return. Kurath and Thomas move in together and Thomas enrolls in school. Thomas' father, however, then has him arrested and condemned to a brutal reformatory. Kurath obtains a fake passport and poses as a psychology doctoral candidate and helps Thomas escape with him to Germany. They are betrayed by a German homosexual friend of Kurath's who insists, in Kurath's absence, that Thomas become his lover in order to obtain a German residency permit. Thomas does so, but then refuses to sleep with the betrayer, is kicked out and prostitutes himself. Broken by these experiences, he voluntarily returns to the reformatory. When he reaches 21 and is released, he is so psychologically damaged that, despite reunion with Kurath, he attempts suicide and is committed to a psychiatric hospital. He escapes and the film ends with a TV announcement that the police are looking for him and that the public should, if approaching him, treat <b>him</b> <b>gently,</b> as he is very depressed and confused.|$|E
500|$|Many readers remain unconvinced by {{the cast}} and crew's justifications, and others note that Faramir was {{rendered}} too much like Boromir and thus {{the contrast between the}} two was severely weakened. A scene that received additional criticism is the Rangers' treatment of Gollum, who is beaten up, and Faramir's implicit compliance. In the book, Faramir calls the creature Sméagol instead of Gollum, and tells his men to [...] "treat <b>him</b> <b>gently,</b> but watch him".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{takes place}} within the final scene of [...] "Last of the Time Lords". After the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) parts ways with Martha (Freema Agyeman), he tries taking off, only for the TARDIS to spin wildly and sound an alarm. Checking out the systems, the Doctor passes his fifth {{incarnation}} (Peter Davison) doing the same thing. The Tenth Doctor recognises his past self and is overjoyed to see <b>him,</b> <b>gently</b> poking fun at his particular eccentricities, such as the stick of celery on his lapel and the unneeded glasses he sometimes wears; he also explains that his presence has 'shorten out the time differential' between himself and his past incarnation, resulting in the latter gaining an uncharacteristic older physical appearance. [...] The Fifth Doctor is annoyed, believing his counterpart to be a fan who has broken into the TARDIS.|$|E
6000|$|... "They sit hand in hand," [...] {{continued}} the astrologer, raising his voice. [...] "She smiles up at <b>him</b> and <b>gently</b> strokes his head; he----" ...|$|R
6000|$|She came to <b>him</b> very <b>gently,</b> very humbly, {{and just}} touched his arm with her hand. 'Do you mean, George, {{that you have}} {{continued}} to care for me--always?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How brutal of the friend!" [...] {{the girl}} observed. [...] "He might have let <b>him</b> down <b>gently.</b> You wouldn't {{do a thing}} like that, would you, Mr. Pratt?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Australia won the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy in India, finally {{winning the}} ODI tournament that had eluded them despite their World Cup success. After the final in Mumbai, Ponting drew some {{criticism}} for appearing to ask BCCI president and Indian cabinet minister Sharad Pawar to [...] "leave the podium" [...] and pointing towards the exit with his finger, while his teammate Damien Martyn pushed <b>him</b> <b>gently</b> {{in the back}} so that his team could commence celebrations. The issue, while minor, was solved when Ponting issued a formal apology to Pawar.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{some sources}} Muawiyah warned his son Yazid against mistreating Hussein ibn Ali, {{grandson}} of Muhammad. His final warning to Yazid was: [...] "Be careful O my son, {{that you do}} not meet God with his blood, lest you be amongst those that will perish" [...] Robert Payne quotes Muawiyah in History of Islam as telling his son Yazid to defeat Hussein, who was surely preparing an army against him, but to deal with <b>him</b> <b>gently</b> thereafter as Hussein was a descendent of Muhammad; but to deal with Abdullah al-Zubair swiftly, as Muawiyah feared him the most.|$|E
2500|$|Melville biographer Delbanco cites race as {{an example}} of this search for truth beneath surface differences. All races are {{represented}} among the crew members of the Pequod. [...] Although Ishmael initially is afraid of Queequeg as a tattooed cannibal, he soon decides, [...] "Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian." [...] While it may be rare for a mid-19th century American book to feature black characters in a nonslavery context, slavery is frequently mentioned. The theme of race is primarily carried by Pip, the diminutive black cabin boy. When Pip has almost drowned, Ahab, genuinely touched by Pip's suffering, questions <b>him</b> <b>gently,</b> Pip [...] "can only parrot the language of an advertisement for the return of a fugitive slave: 'Pip! Reward for Pip!'".|$|E
6000|$|... "You can't!... Perhaps, after a while, you {{may come}} to feel differently--I didn't mean to startle you," [...] she heard <b>him</b> reply <b>gently.</b> This humility, in him, was unbearable.|$|R
60|$|She smiled upon <b>him</b> delightfully, and <b>gently</b> withdrew her hand.|$|R
60|$|Murgh let {{his eyes}} rest on him. Then {{stretching}} out his hand, he touched <b>him</b> very <b>gently</b> on the breast, {{and as he}} touched him smiled a sweet and wondrous smile.|$|R
60|$|Presently {{she pushed}} <b>him</b> <b>gently</b> away--held him there at arm's length.|$|E
60|$|She drew {{away from}} <b>him,</b> <b>gently,</b> {{and turned toward}} the window.|$|E
60|$|She thrust her {{arm through}} his and led <b>him</b> <b>gently</b> to the sofa.|$|E
6000|$|She {{came up to}} him and put {{her hand}} upon his shoulder, and spoke to <b>him</b> very <b>gently.</b> [...] "Tom," [...] she said, [...] "is that the way in which you speak to your wife?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} laid <b>him</b> back <b>gently</b> {{on the snow}} and prayed for that {{unprepared}} and guilty spirit, and as he prayed {{the sun came up}} at a bound, and the robins began chirping in the ivy.|$|R
6000|$|I am {{glad you}} liked Burns; I {{think it is}} the best thing I ever did. Did not the {{national}} vanity exclaim? Do you know what Shairp thought? I think I let <b>him</b> down <b>gently,</b> did I not? ...|$|R
60|$|He {{had risen}} to his feet, but she drew <b>him</b> <b>gently</b> down again.|$|E
60|$|He {{walked over}} to White Fang and began talking to <b>him</b> <b>gently</b> and soothingly.|$|E
60|$|Hilary {{moved the}} chair, and, taking him beneath the arms, lowered <b>him</b> <b>gently</b> into it.|$|E
60|$|The poor {{schoolmaster}} {{motioned to}} the bachelor that he would come on the other side, and speak to <b>him.</b> They <b>gently</b> unlocked his fingers, which he had twisted in his grey hair, and pressed them in their own.|$|R
60|$|Still {{he shook}} his head, and finally he drew her to <b>him</b> very <b>gently</b> and stooped to kiss her, but first he looked into her eyes and waited to learn if she were pleased, or if she would repulse him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Under {{this was}} written, in Midwinter's hand: 'Remember what I told you. Write (it will break it to <b>him</b> more <b>gently</b> in that way), and beg him to accept your apologies, and to excuse you from sailing on the trial cruise.' ...|$|R
60|$|She {{would have}} urged <b>him</b> <b>gently,</b> even then, but he menaced {{her with his}} chain.|$|E
60|$|Isabel {{followed}} the lawyer, and touched <b>him</b> <b>gently</b> {{on the arm}} to rouse his attention.|$|E
60|$|Sheen pushed <b>him</b> <b>gently</b> {{out of the}} way, {{and tore}} down the paper from the door.|$|E
6000|$|MORELL (casting <b>him</b> off <b>gently,</b> but resolutely). Each for himself, Eugene. She {{must choose}} between us now. (He {{goes to the}} other side of the room as Candida returns. Eugene sits down again on the sofa like a guilty schoolboy on his best behaviour.) ...|$|R
6000|$|But Charlotte's eyes {{said nothing}} of the sort to Mr. Slope. He had no {{objection}} at all to the tête-à-tête with the signora which the departure of the other three would allow <b>him,</b> and <b>gently</b> whispered to her, [...] "I shall not leave you alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|Slight as it was, {{the shade}} of melancholy in his manner pained her. Forgetting all other anxieties in the anxiety to cheer <b>him,</b> she <b>gently</b> pressed the hand he gave her. [...] "If that won't tell him the truth," [...] she thought, [...] "nothing will." ...|$|R
