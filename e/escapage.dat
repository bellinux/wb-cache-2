40|$|THE OBJECT OF THIS STUDY WAS THE INVESTIGATION OF THE DRUG-ADDICT FAMILY BACKROUND AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF DRUG-ADDICTION. INTERNAL DYNAMICS RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY WERE ANALYSED. IN THE EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH TWO GROUPS OF DRUG-ADDICTS WERE INVOLVED. THE FIRST GROUP, INCLUDED 30 ADDICTS UNDER TREATMENT IN THE DRUG DEPENDANCY UNIT OF THE STATE MENTAL HOSPITAL OF ATTICA (18 ANO) AND THEIR PARENTS. THE SECOND, CONTROL GROUP, INVOLVED 30 NON-ADDICT MAINTAINING CLOSE FRIENDSHIPTIES WITH THE ADDICTS, AND THEIR PARENTS TOO. THE MOOS FAMILY ENVIRONMEMT SCALE (FES) AND MADIANOS FAMILY ATMOSPHERE SCALE (FAS) WERE COMPLETED AND PROCESSED BY BOTH GROUPS. ALSO, THE HOLMES AND RAHE LIFE EVENTS SCALE WAS ADMINISTERED AND ANSWEREDBY THE ADDICTS AND THEIR FRIENDS. ADDITIONALY, A WRITTEN QUESTIONNAIR, PREPARED SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS REASON (18 ANO QUESTIONNAIRE), WAS COMPLETED BY THE ADDICTS, WHILE THE RESEARCH WAS CONCLUDED WITH EXHAUSTIVE INTERVIEWS OF THE PARTICIPATING MEMBERS. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY CAN BE FORMULATED AS FOLLOWS: THE DRUG-ADDICT IS A PERSON OVER-INVOLVED ON HIS FAMILY, LIVING WITH IT EVEN AS AN ADULT. ALTHOUGH IN CONSTANT CINFLICT WITH THE FAMILY HE (OR SHE) IS ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON PARENTS NOT ONLY FINANCIALLY BUT ALSO, AND MAINLY, SENTIMENTALLY FINALLY RETURNING HOME AFTER EVERY <b>ESCAPAGE</b> ATTEMPTED.

Desired trap and bait attributes include: high D. suzukii capture and species specificity; early-season detection prior to significant crop damage; higher capture of females than males; limit <b>escapage</b> from trap; and a positive response to seasonal changes in population, landscape, and weather. Bait trials were replicated 3 - 4 times in 4 different host crops, including: 'Spartan' cultivar blueberries on a no-spray farm (Benton Co. Oregon); a wild 'Himalaya' blackberry perimeter adjacent to a diversified, organic-certified farm (Benton Co., Oregon); no-spray Early 'Burlette' cultivar cherries on a diversified, organic-certified farm (Benton Co., Oregon); and organic 'Nleeker' cultivar raspberries on an organic-certified farm (Whatcom Co., Washington). Baits included: apple cider vinegar, Chinkiang vinegar, Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast, Hanseniaspora uvarum yeast, BioLure®, Torula Yeast Pellets®, Monterey Insect Bait®, Suzukii Trap®, and a 4 -compound (acetic acid, methionil, acetoin, and ethanol) lure. Each bait was placed in a 950 mL side-mesh entry clear cup trap. Chinkiang vinegar and H. uvarum-baited traps had consistently high D. suzukii counts in all crop types tested. Suzukii Trap® baited traps had promising results; however, factors such as humidity and bait evaporation affected captures in blueberry and blackberry crops. Consistently, Torula Yeast Pellets® baited traps had low efficacy, and BioLure® and Monterey Insect Bait® baited traps showed little to no efficacy. Traps with the 4 -compound lure yielded moderate trap catch relative to other baits, but showed the highest specificity to D. suzukii across the season. During the late-season period, traps baited with apple cider vinegar showed increased D. suzukii capture compared to observed early-season counts. Early-season Drosophila species captures were primarily other Drosophila species (66 - 100...|$|E
