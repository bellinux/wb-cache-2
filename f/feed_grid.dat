Whilst the above initial combing is taking place the drawing-off rollers, mounted on a carriage, move towards the nipper jaws and grip the fringe of fibres {{as soon as the}} last row of pins on the comb cylinder has passed through the fringe projecting from the nipper jaws. As the drawing-off rollers grip the projecting fringe, the intersector comb descends, piercing the fringe of fibres, the nipper jaws open and the fibres are given their second combing by the rotation and recession of the drawing-off rollers pulling the fibres through the pins of the intersector comb and the pins of the <b>feed</b> <b>grid.</b> The combed fibres are then conveyed by the leather apron of the drawing-off rollers to the front rollers of the carriage, down a funnel and through the calender rollers, into a can placed directly underneath.|$|E
50|$|Some {{electric}} railway systems {{also use}} DC power and thus {{make use of}} power electronics to <b>feed</b> <b>grid</b> power to the locomotives and often for speed control of the locomotive's motor. In the middle twentieth century, rectifier locomotives were popular, these used power electronics to convert AC power from the railway network for use by a DC motor. Today most electric locomotives are supplied with AC power and run using AC motors, but still use power electronics to provide suitable motor control. The use of power electronics to assist with motor control and with starter circuits cannot be underestimated and, in addition to rectification, is responsible for power electronics appearing {{in a wide range}} of industrial machinery. Power electronics even appear in modern residential air conditioners.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{initially}} {{investigates the}} conventional LCL filter grid-connected inverts system, which introduces the control strategy with inverter-side current feedback, and analyzes the deficiencies within the strategy. The {{stability of the}} controller can be improved by adopting the active damping scheme. However, the output current of the inverter is severely influenced by the external grid voltage distortion and the grid low-order harmonic voltage. In order to reduce this impact and gain high-quality power, a novel control strategy is proposed in this paper, in which the virtual complex impedance is introduced to <b>feed</b> <b>grid</b> voltage forward. By using the proposed control strategy, the total harmonic distortion can be greatly decreased, allowing the grid current to synchronize the reference current well. In addition, the modulation of the virtual complex impedance by controller can also quantificationally regulate the equivalent output impedance, which brings great convenience for inverters system designers to calculating and devising. Simulation results are presented to prove the validity and improvements achieved by the proposed controller...|$|E
40|$|One {{step towards}} a more {{sustainable}} energy system {{is to create a}} more flexible electrical grid, where increased demand response among electricity consumers can play an important role. A distribution grid owner can encourage their customers to use electricity more evenly distributed during the day by introducing different types of grid fees such as time-differentiated power tariffs. In this master thesis, the theoretical economic impact of a flattened load profile for a distribution grid owner is investigated. Different factors that impact the distribution grid owner’s economy are identified and two are chosen to be quantified; losses in the grid and the fee to the <b>feeding</b> <b>grid.</b> The possibility to save money by avoiding future investments is discussed but not quantified. Models are developed for modifying an existing load profile, calculating the losses associated with a certain grid and load profile, and calculating the value of a lowered subscribed power to the <b>feeding</b> <b>grid.</b> The models are applied on the distribution grid owner Sala-Heby Energi Elnät AB. The results show that with a load profile that is flattened out 100 % every day, which is the theoretical best possible scenario, the losses can be reduced with 2. 6 % which corresponds to a value of 81 000 SEK. By lowering the subscribed power to the <b>feeding</b> <b>grid</b> as much as the highest peak of the year is reduced in the modified load curve, the cost to the <b>feeding</b> <b>grid</b> would be reduced 1. 2 million SEK, or 10 % of the fee to the <b>feeding</b> <b>grid.</b> In the 20 % curve modification case, which would be more realistic to achieve in reality, the losses decreased by 0. 9 % which corresponds to a value of 29 000 SEK. Furthermore, the fee to <b>feeding</b> <b>grid</b> would be reduced with 0. 34 million SEK which corresponds to 2. 8 % of the total fee. In summary, the theoretical economic saving potential is around 10 times higher for the fee to <b>feeding</b> <b>grid</b> than for grid losses. Marknadsbaserade styrmedel i bostadssektor...|$|R

40|$|Power factor {{correction}} (PFC) converters with low harmonic input resistance are desirable loads {{to support the}} reduction of the harmonic distortion on the <b>feeding</b> <b>grid.</b> Therefore, a novel control strategy is proposed. Whereas previously proposed controllers tried to obtain a resistive behavior of the converter with a constant input impedance for all frequencies, including the fundamental, the proposed control strategy allows to set a harmonic input resistance which is independent of the input power level of the converter. Consequently, the harmonic input resistance remains low, even when the input power of the converter is decreased, which adds to the stability of the <b>feeding</b> <b>grid.</b> This paper describes the operation of a digitally controlled boost PFC converter with the new control algorithm. Experimental tests on a 1 -kW prototype show that a practical realization of the algorithm is possible and that a programmable harmonic input resistance of the converter is obtained. The converter contributes to the damping in the power system, which is an important feature to mitigate harmonic voltage distortion due to resonances. The damping potential of the converter with the proposed control strategy is demonstrated on a scale model of a distribution system with a parallel resonance. status: publishe...|$|R
