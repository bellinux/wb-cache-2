40|$|AbstractInternal {{fragments}} of the putative transposase gene of mariner-like elements (MLEs) were amplified from human, mouse, rat, chinese hamster, sheep and bovine genomic DNAs by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The sequences identified in human, ovine and bovine genomes correspond to ancient degenerate transposons. Screening mammalian sequence libraries identified a truncated element in the human ABL gene and the sequence of its 5 ′-ITR was determined. This ITR sequences were used in PCR experiments with DNA from six mammalian species and detected full-sized and deleted MLEs. The presence of MLE in mammalian genomes demonstrates that they are ubiquitous mobile elements found from fungi to man. This observation strongly {{raises the possibility that}} MLE could constitute tools for the modification of <b>eucaryotic</b> <b>genomes...</b>|$|E
40|$|Polypurine/polypyrimidine {{repetitive}} sequences {{occur with}} high frequency in <b>eucaryotic</b> <b>genomes,</b> particularly around transcription units. Since such sequences {{are known to}} adopt triple stranded-structures under appropriate conditions in vitro, it is of major interest {{to know if they}} occur in vivo, and thus if they can have some biological importance by inducing structural constraints in the genomic DNA. To this end, we have isolated a (TTCCC) 48 sequence, present in the promoter of an avian gene, and tested its ability to form PU-PY-PY and PU-PU-PY triple helices in vitro, through the oligonucleotide gel shift technique and single strand-specific nuclease footprinting. We have then developed an oligonucleotide protection assay, which can be adapted to in vivo investigations. This strategy leads us to conclude that in vivo conditions allow preponderant formation of triplex of the PU-PU-PY class...|$|E
40|$|Motivation: The major {{challenge}} in understanding genomic sequences is to reveal how spatio-temporal information on gene expression is encoded in the genome. Identification of regions on the genome that contain regulatory information {{is the first}} stage of this process. It is widely accepted that comparative sequence data can help in location of these regions in higher <b>eucaryotic</b> <b>genomes.</b> The inter-species comparison allows us to identify highly conserved regions on the genome that can contain clusters of binding sites for multiple transcription factors. Results: With published genomic sequences for Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila pseudoobscura, we identified conserved regions on the genome that contain putative transcription factor binding sites. For the clusters of co-expressed genes found via microarray data analysis, we ran searches for statistically over-represented motifs in the corresponding groups of non-coding conserved sequences. These searches were carried out with SPEXS, which enumerates and scores all shared motifs in the sequences of unrestricted length.

40|$|The {{alternating}} sequence poly(dG-dT). poly(dA-dC) is {{a highly}} repeated sequence in the <b>eucaryotic</b> <b>genome.</b> We have examined the effect of trans-acting early viral proteins {{on the ability of}} the GT element to stimulate transcription of the adenovirus major late promoter (MLP). We find that the GT element alone does not activate expression from the MLP in either {{the presence or absence of}} another enhancer element. However, in the presence of the E 1 A gene products of either adenovirus type 5 or 2, the GT element activated expression from the MLP. The stimulatory activity of the GT element in the presence of E 1 A had the properties of an enhancer element, and the trans-activating effect on the GT element was additive in conjunction with the E 1 A-responsive BK virus enhancer. We also have demonstrated that a specific nuclear factor(s) binds to the GT element. However, the E 1 A protein(s) do not affect the initial factor interaction(s) with the GT element. Overall, our data demonstrate that trans modulation of promoter activity can be mediated through the GT element...|$|R
40|$|We {{isolated}} clones {{and determined}} {{the sequence of}} portions of mouse and human cellular DNA which cross-hybridize strongly with the IR 3 repetitive region of Epstein-Barr virus. The sequences {{were found to be}} tandem arrays of a simple sequence based on the triplet GGA, very similar to the IR 3 repeat. The cellular repeats have distinct differences from the viral repeat region, however, and their sequences do not appear capable of being translated into a purely glycine-plus-alanine protein domain like the portion of the Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen coded by IR 3. Although the relationship between IR 3 and the cellular repeats is left unclear, the cellular repeats have many interesting features. The tandem arrays are about 1 to several kilobases long, much shorter than satellite tandem repeats and larger than other interspersed, tandem repeats. Each of the repeats is a distinct variation, perhaps diverged from a common sequence, (GGA) n. This family is present in the genomes of all species tested and appears to be a ubiquitous feature of all higher <b>eucaryotic</b> <b>genomes...</b>|$|E

The SCF (Skp 1 –Cul 1 –F-box) and ECS (ElonginC–Cul 2 –SOCS box) complexes {{are so far}} the best-characterized cullin-based ligases. Their {{atomic structure}} has been solved recently, and several substrates have been described in different organisms. In addition to Cul 1 and Cul 2, higher <b>eucaryotic</b> <b>genomes</b> encode for three other cullins: Cul 3, Cul 4, and Cul 5.

In these complexes, BTB-domain-containing proteins may bridge the cullin to the substrate in a single polypeptide, while Skp 1 /F-box or ElonginC/SOCS heterodimers fulfill this function in the SCF and ECS complexes. BTB-containing proteins are evolutionary conserved and involved in diverse biological processes, but their function has not previously been linked to ubiquitin-dependent degradation.

The {{results indicate that the}} following features are typical of these TG-elements: the elements consist of 20 to 60 base pairs of (dT-dG) n. (dC-dA) n, the sequences characterized in our study were not flanked by direct or inverted repeats, the sequences are interspersed rather than in satellite blocks, the elements are not usually associated with other repeated elements, and some of the elements are found near coding sequences or in introns. Studies on the conformation of a genomic TG-element in a supercoiled plasmid indicate several distinct properties of the TG-element: it is in the Z-form only at low ionic strength, S 1 nuclease recognizes its Z-form with a marked preference for one of the B-Z junctions, and the sensitive region extends for 20 base pairs near the B-Z junction. In contrast to the result with the supercoiled plasmid, S 1 nuclease failed to recognize the TG-element in minichromosomes...|$|E
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that duplications {{have played a}} major role in <b>eucaryotic</b> <b>genome</b> evolution. Sequencing data revealed the presence of large duplicated regions in the <b>genomes</b> of many <b>eucaryotic</b> organisms, and comparative studies have suggested that duplication of large DNA segments has been a continuing process during evolution. However, little experimental data have been produced regarding this issue. Using a gene dosage assay for growth recovery in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we demonstrate that a majority of the revertant strains (58 %) resulted from the spontaneous duplication of large DNA segments, either intra- or interchromosomally, ranging from 41 to 655 kb in size. These events result in the concomitant duplication of dozens of genes and in some cases in the formation of chimeric open reading frames at the junction of the duplicated blocks. The types of sequences at the breakpoints as well as their superposition with the replication map suggest that spontaneous large segmental duplications result from replication accidents. Aneuploidization events or suppressor mutations that do not involve large-scale rearrangements accounted for the rest of the reversion events (in 26 and 16 % of the strains, respectively) ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{distribution}} of accessible antigenic {{sites in the}} chromosomal protein high mobility group one (HMG- 1) in Chironomus thummi polytene chromosomes is visualized by immunofluorescence. The results indicate that (a) HMG- 1 is distributed in a distinct banding pattern along {{the entire length of}} the chromosomes; (b) the banding pattern obtained with fluorescent antibody does not strictly correspond to that observed by phase-contrast microscopy; and (c) the amount of HMG- 1 increases, and the fluorescent banding pattern changes, during the development of the organism. Our findings suggest that the protein may be involved in the modulation of the structure of selected loci in the chromosome. The nonhistone chromosomal proteins are an integral part of the <b>eucaryotic</b> <b>genome.</b> Although the function of these proteins is not well understood, there is evidence that some proteins belonging to this group are important in maintaining the structure (1, 36) and regulating the function (9, 35, 41) of chromatin and chromosomes. The difficulties in purifying homogeneous molecular species from this group of proteins are a major obstacle in elucidating their function.

40|$|The {{mitochondrial}} DNA {{of plant}} and animal cells is a transcriptionally active genome that traces its origins to a symbiotic infection of eucaryotic cells by bacterial progenitors. As prescribed by the Serial Endosymbiosis Theory, symbiotic organelles have gradually transferred their genes to the <b>eucaryotic</b> <b>genome,</b> producing a functional interaction of nuclear and mitochondrial genes in organelle function. We report here a recent remarkable transposition of 7. 9 kb of a typically 17. 0 -kb mitochondrial genome to a specific nuclear chromosomal position in the domestic cat. The integrated segment has subsequently become amplified 38 – 76 times and now occurs as a tandem repeat macrosatellite with multiple-length alleles resolved by pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) segregating in cat populations. Sequence determination of the nuclear mitochondrial DNA segment, Numt, revealed a d(CA) -rich 8 -bp motif [ACACACGT] repeated imperfectly five times at the deletion junction that is a likely target for recombination. The extent and pattern of sequence divergence of Numt genes from the cytoplasmic mtDNA homologues plus the occurrence of Numt in other species of the family Felidae allowed an estimate for the origins of Numt at 1. 8 – 2. 0 million years ago in an ancestor of four modern species in the genus Felis. Numt genes do not function in cats; rather, the locus combines properties of nuclear minisatellites and pseudogenes. These observations provide an empirical glimpse of historic genomic events that may parallel the accommodation of organelles in eucaryotes...|$|R

Sapienza and W. F. Doolittle, Nature (London) 295 : 384 - 389, 1982], has DNA reiteration been reported as a common genomic feature. The genomes of two Rhizobium phaseoli strains, one Rhizobium meliloti strain, and one Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain were analyzed for the presence of repetitive DNA. Rhizobium and Agrobacterium spp. are closely related soil bacteria that interact with plants and that belong to the taxonomical family Rhizobiaceae. Rhizobium species establish a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis in the roots of legumes, whereas Agrobacterium species is a pathogen in different plants. The four strains revealed a large number of repeated DNA sequences. The family size was usually small, from 2 to 5 elements, but some presented more than 10 elements. Rhizobium and Agrobacterium spp. contain large plasmids in addition to the chromosomes. Analysis of the two Rhizobium strains indicated that DNA reiteration is not confined to the chromosome or to some plasmids but is a property of the whole genome...|$|E
40|$|Triplet {{nucleotide}} repeats are ubiquitous {{and rapidly}} evolving sequences in <b>eucaryotic</b> <b>genomes.</b> They are sporadically found in coding regions of transcription regulators where they become translated in different homopolymeric aminoacid (HPAA) stretches, {{depending on the}} local frame. Poly(CAG) yields three different HPAAs (poly Gln, Ser or Ala). Current sequence databases indicate a clear bias in the size and frequency of these HPAAs according to the rule: (Gln) n > (Ser) n >> (Ala) n. Aiming to understand the reasons of this bias, we changed the translational reading frame of the highly polymorphic CAG-repeat that normally encodes poly-Gln in the N-terminal portion of the rat glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The GR mutant in which the CAG repeat is translated to poly-Ala (called GR[Ala]) is incapable of transactivation, but maintains competence for hormone binding, nuclear translocation and specific DNA binding. We show that GR desactivation is obtained only when a very precise threshold length of the repeat is reached. GR[Ala] displays a strong negative dominance when tested for transcriptional activation in vivo and may become useful for selective competition of receptor dependent activities in tissue culture cells and transgenic animals. We discuss the implications of our findings for {{the understanding of the}} evolutionary behaviour of trinucleotide repeats in coding sequences...|$|E
40|$|Epigenetic marks that specify silent {{heterochromatic}} domains in <b>eucaryotic</b> <b>genomes</b> include methylation of histone H 3 lysine 9. Strikingly, active loci in {{the vicinity}} of silent domains are sometimes characterized by acetylation of histone H 3 lysine 9, suggesting that the balance between these two competitive modifications is important for the establishment of specific chromatin structures. Some euchromatic genes, targeted by the retinoblastoma protein Rb, are also believed to be regulated by histone H 3 lysine 9 methylation. Here, we study the dihydrofolate reductase promoter, which is repressed in G 0 and at the beginning of G 1 by p 107 or p 130, two Rb-related proteins. We found that these two pocket proteins share with Rb the ability to associate with the histone methyl transferase SUV 39 H 1. SUV 39 H 1 can be recruited to the E 2 F transcription factor and functions as a transcriptional corepressor. With ChIP assays followed by real-time PCR, we showed that K 9 of histone H 3 evolves from a hypermethylated state in G 0 to a hyperacetylated state at the G 1 /S transition. Taken together, these results indicate that the temporal regulation of euchromatic promoters may involve controlling the balance between methylation and acetylation of histone H 3 lysine 9, a feature previously described for the spatial regulation of chromatin function...|$|E

40|$|Genetic {{information}} of organisms is preserved within sequences of nucleotides in genomic DNAs, which are {{possible to be}} replicated by DNA polymerase semiconservatively. The sequences of the DNA molecules in organisms are variant, but long. Even the DNA of Mycoplasma genitalium, which has a smallest DNA among all types of organisms, is of 580 -kilobase pairs in length. However, the long DNA can be synthesized with neither some prebiotic experiments nor the present DNA synthesizing techniques. Only oligoribonucleotides 55 mer are possible to be synthesized {{in the presence of}} a montmollironite clay under prebiotic conditions. How is the long DNA synthesized in the primordial environment? Ohno proposed the model that genes of the present organisms emerged from short repetitive oligoribonucleotides. Several types of DNA polymerase are capable to synthesize long repetitive DNAs with more than 50 -kilobase pairs in length from short oligonucleotides such as (TA) n, (TG) n, (CAG) n, (TAGG) n, (TTAGGG) n, (TACATGTA) n, and (AGATATCT) n by conventional enzymatic reactions. Furthermore, telomerase, which catalyzes the synthesis of the telomere of <b>eucaryotic</b> <b>genome</b> ends, can synthesize the complementary repetitive DNA (TTGGGG) n {{in the presence of a}} RNA template by the reverse-transcriptional activity. There are various repetitive sequences such as (GT) n, (CAG) n, (GGAAT) n, and (TTAGGC) n in the genomic DNA of different organisms containing Bacteria and Eucarya. Based on these examples, it is deduced that short repetitive DNA should have been synthesized from short RNA in the presence of oligopeptides catalysts or ribozymes, which have primordial reverse transcriptase-like activity; genomic DNA should have emerged from long repetitive DNAs elongated from the short repetitive DNA in the presence of primordial DNA polymerase-like oligopeptides or ribozymes. I discuss the plausibility of these ideas, proposing a model for the origin of genomic DNA from the reverse-transcription and expansion of repetitive oligonucleotides...|$|R

The effects of simian virus 40 T-antigen-dependent substrate replication upon the stimulation of recombination conferred by the Z-DNA motif d(TG) 30 were analyzed. Presence of d(TG) 30 adjacent to a T-antigen-binding site I can stimulate homologous recombination between nonreplicating plasmids, providing that T antigen is absent, in both simian CV- 1 cells and human EJ cells (W. P. Wahls, L. J. Wallace, and P. D. Moore, Mol. Cell. Biol. 10 : 785 - 793). It has also been shown elsewhere that the presence of d(TG) n not adjacent to the T-antigen-binding site can stimulate homologous recombination in simian virus 40 molecules replicating in the presence of T antigen (P. Bullock, J. Miller, and M. Botchan, Mol. Cell. Biol. 6 : 3948 - 3953, 1986). However, it is demonstrated here that d(TG) 30 nine base pairs distant from a T-antigen-binding site bound with T antigen does not stimulate recombination between either replicating or nonreplicating substrates in somatic cells. The bound T antigen either prevents the d(TG) 30 sequence from acquiring a recombinogenic configuration (such as left-handed Z-DNA), or it prevents the interaction of recombinase proteins with the sequence by stearic hindrance...|$|E

Hybridization of the IS-containing probes to each other revealed a region of limited homology between IS 1 and IS 2. Homologous sequences were then detected by computer analysis of the published IS 1 and IS 2 nucleotide sequences. The homologous sequence contains a tandemly repeated tetranucleotide sequence which resembles the repeated sequence at the hot spot for spontaneous mutations in the lacI gene (P. J. Farabaugh, U. Schmeissner, M. Hofer, and J. Miller, J. Mol. Biol. 126 : 847 – 863, 1978). Homology between the IS elements and various genomes was determined by hybridizing labeled DNA containing IS 1, IS 2, and IS 5 sequences to Southern blots of chromosomal DNA cleaved with restriction endonucleases. IS 1 and IS 5 appear limited to the enteric bacteria, whereas IS 2 sequences can also be detected in Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens. Bacteria which appear not to possess extrachromosomal elements, e. g., Caulobacter crescentus, did not show homology with any insertion sequences tested.

Double-stranded long repeat DNA prepared in this manner ranged in length from approximately 3000 to 15 000 nucleotide pairs with average sizes of approximately 6000 base pairs. In the electron microscope, long repeat DNA was observed to possess continuous sequences that often appeared to be terminated {{by one or more}} loops and/or fold backs. Long repeat DNA sequences, resheared to 300 base pairs, were found to have an average melting point identical to that for sheared native DNA. Thus, the reassociated duplexes of long repetitive DNA seem to possess very few mismatched base pairs. Reassociation kinetic analyses indicate {{that the majority of the}} long repeat sequences are reiterated only 4 - 7 times per haploid amount of DNA. Melt-reassociation analyses of short repetitive DNA, at several criteria, support the previously held concept that these sequences belong the sets or families of sequences which are inexact copies of one another.

(dC-dA) n tract (30, 40, or 50 base pairs) or chemically synthesized (dT-dG) n. (dC-dA) n fragments (50 to 130 base pairs) were inserted in the pSV 2 -cat (simian virus 40 enhancer plus) or pA 10 -cat (enhancer minus) expression vector plasmid. These constructs were transfected into CV- 1 cells or HeLa cells, and their transcription was monitored by assaying chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity. The results showed that pSV 2 -cat with the TG-element and pA 10 -cat with the TG-element synthesized more chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity (2 to 10 times, depending on the location of the TG-element) than did parental pSV 2 -cat and pA 10 -cat DNAs, respectively. Furthermore, the TG-element appeared to have characteristics similar to those of viral enhancers: (i) the TG-element enhanced transcription from a distance, (ii) its closer location to the promoter was more effective, and (iii) its orientation was not crucial. However, its enhancer-like activity was much weaker than that of the simian virus 40 enhancer, and, unlike many viral enhancers, it was equally active in monkey and in human cells.

Transfection of barley protoplasts with wild-type transcripts of brome mosaic virus RNA- 1 and RNA- 3 and serial dilutions of RNA- 2 transcripts possessing unaltered coding sequences but bearing mutations that greatly incapacitated replication of RNA- 2 revealed that trace amounts of RNA- 2 are sufficient to support replication of the viral genome. In six replicate experiments containing RNA- 2 transcripts devoid of the 3 ' 200 nucleotides that encompass the tRNA-like structure containing the minus-strand promoter, detectable levels of progeny RNA- 1 and RNA- 3 and subgenomic RNA- 4 were present. This showed that viral p 2 protein translated from the supplied RNA- 2 functioned in trans to support replication of RNA- 1 and RNA- 3. However, in two similar experiments, progeny RNA- 2 with electrophoretic mobility indistinguishable from that of wild-type RNA- 2 was seen at 24 h postinoculation. Northern hybridization (RNA blot) analysis confirmed the presence of the tRNA-like 3 ' terminus on these progeny RNAs, indicating that recombinational restoration of the deleted sequence had occurred.

In this report, the patterns of persistence of the viral genome in the revertants were analyzed in detail. In some of the revertant cell lines, F 10, TR 3, and TR 7, all copies of Ad 12 DNA integrated in line T 637 were lost. In lines TR 1, - 2, - 4 to - 6, - 8 to - 10, and - 13 to - 16, only the right-hand portion of one Ad 12 genome was preserved; it consisted of the intact right segment of Ad 12 DNA and was integrated at the same site as in line T 637. In revertant lines G 12, TR 11, and TR 12, one Ad 12 DNA and varying parts of a second viral DNA molecule persisted in the host genome. These patterns of persistence of Ad 12 DNA molecules in different revertants supported a model for a mode of integration of Ad 12 DNA in T 637 hamster cells in which multiple (20 to 22) copies of the entire Ad 12 DNA were serially arranged, separated from each other by stretches of cellular DNA. The occurrence of such revertants demonstrated that foreign DNA sequences could not only be acquired but could also be lost from <b>eucaryotic</b> <b>genomes.</b> There was very little, if any, expression of Ad 12 -specific DNA sequences in the revertant lines TR 7 and TR 12. Moreover, Ad 12 DNA sequences which were found to be undermethylated in line T 637 were completely methylated in the revertant cell lines G 12, TR 11, TR 12, and TR 2. These findings were consistent with the absence of T antigen from the revertant lines reported earlier. Hence it was conceivable that the expression of integrated viral DNA sequences was somehow dependent on their positions in the cellular genome. In cell line TR 637, the early segments of Ad 12 DNA were expressed and undermethylated; conversely, in the revertant lines G 12, TR 11, TR 12, and TR 2, the same segments appeared to be expressed to a limited extent and were strongly methylated...|$|E
