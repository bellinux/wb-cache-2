5|$|One of {{the people}} to whom Jenner posed <b>his</b> <b>question</b> was Noel Stanton, a man from Bedfordshire, England, who was serving in Sydney with the Royal Navy at the time. Stanton became preoccupied with the memory of this meeting for several months {{afterwards}} and, the next year, became a committed Christian. Stanton went on to found the Jesus Army in Northampton, England, in 1969. In 1945, Jenner approached Norrie Jeffs, who had just returned from participating in Operation Meridian at Palembang on Sumatra, and, having asked Jeffs <b>his</b> <b>question,</b> Jeffs responded that he was already a Christian. Jenner then invited Jeffs over to his house, where Jeffs met several other visitors, including the woman who would later become his wife. In 1952, another person Jenner accosted with <b>his</b> <b>question</b> on George Street was Ian Boyden, a man from Roseville who was serving in the Royal Australian Air Force. After having a brief conversation with Jenner, Boyden accepted Jenner's invitation to attend a church service at Renwick Gospel Hall, where he responded to the sermon by committing to living as a Christian thenceforward, which he did for at least fifty years. Many other people who had a brief encounter with Jenner on the street in Sydney also became Christians, but Jenner did not realise that any {{of the people}} he accosted had remained a Christian beyond their initial profession of faith until 1953, when Francis Dixon told him the stories of several such people.|$|E

During the Million Dollar Tournament of Ten which aired in November 2009, Sam Murray, who had previously supplied correct responses for eleven questions, risked his winnings on a special $1,000,000 question; {{he was the only}} contestant to answer <b>his</b> <b>question</b> correctly.|$|E

5|$|When Dave Rosten, another Sydney evangelist, {{attempted}} to imitate Jenner's method of evangelism, he was {{punched in the}} midriff by the first person he spoke to, so he decided that Jenner's approach to evangelism was not for others to emulate. In 1947, Jenner asked <b>his</b> <b>question</b> to a man named Angus Carruthers, who responded {{that he was a}} Christian and going to heaven. Jenner invited Carruthers back to his home, where Carruthers met Jenner's daughter, Ann. Carruthers and Ann married three years later.|$|E

25|$|When Brooklyn {{encountered}} her {{difficulties with}} Tecumseh and the minefield, Captain Avery of Brooklyn wanted clarification of his orders {{more rapidly than}} could be done with navy signals, so he asked his army representatives to relay <b>his</b> <b>question</b> to the flagship.

25|$|In France, lacking {{an answer}} to <b>his</b> <b>question</b> or {{satisfactory}} settlement of his truce, Philip VI openly assembled an army of 6,000 soldier to send to support the Scottish troops, to whom he had also been sending supplies since February of that year. Notice was sent to Edward III, informing {{him that if he}} did not submit the dispute to the arbitration of France and the Pope, the French soldiers would be deployed. Edward III flatly refused the demand.|$|E
25|$|The {{use of such}} boards is {{described}} or alluded to in many ancient Chinese texts like the Chu Ci, Han Feizi, Huainanzi, and some military texts. The diviner would rotate the disk until the Dipper pointed in a chosen direction, usually corresponding to the current date. He would then find an answer to <b>his</b> <b>question</b> by means of numerological calculations. Manipulation of this miniature model of the cosmos was supposed to bring power to its user.|$|E
25|$|When {{the game}} begins, Matt meets a person whom he doesn't know, {{and she tells}} him {{that they have to}} get to the bridge at a certain time. Later in the game, Matt goes through {{different}} cars because of the person that he doesn't know gets them for him (except for a few cars in The Run.) Matt asks her about her identity but she doesn't respond to <b>his</b> <b>question.</b> However, there is a conflict when they get to a certain area. There, Matt finds out that the unknown person was using him to get to that area.|$|E

25|$|The Kenzeiki further {{states that}} he found no answer to <b>his</b> <b>question</b> at Mount Hiei, {{and that he was}} disillusioned by the {{internal}} politics and need for social prominence for advancement. Therefore, Dōgen left to seek an answer from other Buddhist masters. He went to visit Kōin, the Tendai abbot of Onjō-ji Temple (園城寺), asking him this same question. Kōin said that, in order to find an answer, he might want to consider studying Chán in China. In 1217, two years after the death of contemporary Zen Buddhist Myōan Eisai, Dōgen went to study at Kennin-ji Temple (建仁寺), under Eisai's successor, Myōzen (明全).|$|E
25|$|First {{appearing}} in the 1987 film, Predator, the eponymous character lands in Val Verde via starship. He has come to this location due to the wars between rebel and government forces, already having made several kills among the locals before beginning to hunt down a United States Army Special Forces group sent there to rescue presidential cabinet ministers kidnapped by guerrilla forces. The Predator dispatches the soldiers one by one with its array of weaponry until Major Dutch Schaeffer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is the last one alive. Dutch eventually confronts the creature, covering himself in mud to hide his heat signature from the Predator's thermal imaging, and setting up numerous booby traps. Though he manages to disable the Predator's cloaking ability, the Predator manages to capture him, and then, in a display of Honour, discards his mask and electronic weaponry before challenging Dutch to a final duel. Physically outmatched, Dutch eventually sets off one of his traps, which crushes and mortally wounds the creature. After being asked what he is by Dutch, the Predator simply mimics <b>his</b> <b>question</b> and sets off his self-destruct device before laughing maniacally, though Dutch manages to escape the explosion.|$|E
500|$|In the {{introduction}} {{section of the}} book, Randall Munroe recounts wondering as a child whether [...] "there were more hard things or soft things in the world", concluding that [...] "the world contained about three billion soft things and five billion hard things". The conversation that was produced by this question impressed Munroe's mother {{to such a degree}} that she wrote it down. Though Munroe later stated that <b>his</b> <b>question</b> was rather meaningless, he used it as an example of how [...] "thoroughly answer a stupid question can take you to some pretty interesting places".|$|E

500|$|The German British {{mathematician}} Walter Ledermann {{described in}} his memoir how he as an assistant in Mathematics met biology professor Thompson at St Andrews in the mid 1930s and how Thompson [...] "was fond of exercising his skills as an amateur of mathematics", that [...] "he used quite sophisticated mathematical methods to elucidate the shapes {{that occur in the}} living world" [...] and [...] "differential equations, a subject which evidently lay outside d'Arcy Thompson's fields of knowledge at that time." [...] Ledermann wrote how on one occasion he helped him, working and writing out the answer to <b>his</b> <b>question.</b>|$|E
500|$|Geographically, {{the city}} of Varanasi is {{situated}} on the Ganges river, where two small, mostly dry rivers named Varana and Asi join the Ganges. Metaphorically, the text adds, Varana is named as it wards off errors of organs (Varayati), and Nasi is named as it destroys the sins committed by one's organs (Nasayati). Atri, after listening to this metaphorical answer, repeats <b>his</b> <b>question,</b> with [...] "but where is this place of Avimuktam?" [...] Yajnavalkya replies that Avimuktam is already within Atri, [...] "where his nose and eye brows meet, for there is {{the place of the}} world of heaven and highest world of Brahman." [...] This Avimuktam is the [...] "abode of Brahman".|$|E
500|$|Harrison biographer Ian Inglis has {{referred}} to the song's [...] "surprisingly complex" [...] lyrics, which in one sense {{can be seen as}} a personal observation on a [...] "failed love affair" [...] yet at the same time serve as a comment on [...] "the universal love for, and among, humankind". This theme had featured in previous Harrison songs such as [...] "Within You Without You" [...] and [...] "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" [...] and would remain prominent in much of his subsequent compositions. The same parallels regarding the universality of love in Harrison's work has been noted by Dale Allison, author of the first [...] "spiritual biography" [...] on the ex-Beatle; [...] "When George asks, 'Isn't It A Pity?'," [...] Allison writes, [...] "the scope of <b>his</b> <b>question</b> is vast: it embraces almost everything." ...|$|E

500|$|In January 2006, David Benioff had a phone {{conversation}} with George R. R. Martin's literary agent about the books he represented, and became interested in A Song of Ice and Fire {{as he had been}} a fan of fantasy fiction when young but had not read the books before. [...] The literary agent then sent the first four books of A Song of Ice and Fire to Benioff. Benioff read a few hundred pages of the first novel, A Game of Thrones, shared his enthusiasm with D. B. Weiss and suggested that they adapt Martin's novels into a television series; Weiss finished the first novel in [...] "maybe 36 hours". They pitched the series to HBO after a five-hour meeting with Martin (a veteran screenwriter) in a restaurant on Santa Monica Boulevard. According to Benioff, they won Martin over with their answer to <b>his</b> <b>question,</b> [...] "Who is Jon Snow's mother?" ...|$|E
500|$|The same {{search for}} direct intuition and {{understanding}} {{can be seen}} with Vivekananda. Not satisfied with his knowledge of philosophy, Narendra came to [...] "the question which marked the real beginning of his intellectual quest for God." [...] He asked several prominent Calcutta residents if they had come [...] "face to face with God", but none of their answers satisfied him. At this time, Narendra met Debendranath Tagore (the leader of Brahmo Samaj) {{and asked if he}} had seen God. Instead of answering <b>his</b> <b>question,</b> Tagore said [...] "My boy, you have the Yogis eyes." [...] According to Banhatti, it was Ramakrishna who really answered Narendra's question, by saying [...] "Yes, I see Him as I see you, only in an infinitely intenser sense." [...] Nevertheless, Vivekananda was more influenced by the Brahmo Samaj's and its new ideas, than by Ramakrishna. It was Sen's influence who brought Vivekananda fully into contact with western esotericism, and it was also via Sen that he met Ramakrishna.|$|E
500|$|After the {{election}} was called in April 1957 for 10 June, Howe raised sufficient money to enable the Liberals to heavily outspend their opponents. [...] As there were few Liberal ministers from western Canada, Howe was called upon to make appearances throughout the region. He found that the Manitoba Farmers Union was organizing opposition to the Liberals; at some meetings Howe had difficulty getting heard at all. At other meetings, Howe engaged in well publicised conflicts with audience members. On 19 May in Morris, Manitoba, Howe told one man demanding to speak that when his own party held a meeting, he could ask all the questions he wanted. The man, Bruce Mackenzie, {{proved to be the}} head of a local Liberal association. As Howe left, another man asked why he had not answered <b>his</b> <b>question,</b> posed earlier. Howe replied, [...] "Look here, my good man, when {{the election}} comes, why don't you go away and vote for the party you support? [...] In fact, why don't you just go away?" [...] At another meeting a few days later, Howe was asked why he did not care about the farmers's economic plight. [...] "Looks like you've been eating pretty well under a Liberal government", Howe replied, poking the questioner in the midsection.|$|E
