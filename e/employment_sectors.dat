5|$|Tourism {{supported}} by fishing is {{the mainstay of}} Whitby's economy in an isolated community with poor transport infrastructure and restricted by building constraints in the surrounding North York Moors National Park. The economy is governed by the changing fortunes of fishing, tourism and to some extent, manufacturing. Structural changes have led to concentrations of deprivation, unemployment and benefit dependence. A narrowing employment base and dependence on low wage and low skill sectors has resulted in younger age groups leaving the area. There are few business start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises. Older people who make increasing demands on the area's health and social care capacity have moved into the area. Demographic changes, Whitby's relative isolation from the region's main growth areas and decline in traditional <b>employment</b> <b>sectors</b> pose an economic challenge.|$|E
5|$|Nowadays, {{manufacturing}} is in decline, but {{the city}} boasts strong software, publishing and service-oriented industries, being home to companies such as Future plc and London & Country mortgage brokers. The city's attraction to tourists has also led to {{a significant number of}} jobs in tourism-related industries. Important economic sectors in Bath include education and health (30,000 jobs), retail, tourism and leisure (14,000 jobs) and business and professional services (10,000 jobs). Major employers are the National Health Service, the city's two universities, and the Bath and North East Somerset Council, as well as the Ministry of Defence although a number of MOD offices formerly in Bath have recently moved to Bristol. Growing <b>employment</b> <b>sectors</b> include information and communication technologies and creative and cultural industries where Bath is one of the recognised national centres for publishing, with the magazine and digital publisher Future plc employing around 650 people. Others include Buro Happold (400) and IPL Information Processing Limited (250).

50|$|According to the Vision of Britain website in 1881, {{the primary}} {{occupation}} was unknown for females, {{this may have}} been because at this time the majority of women were unemployed. For females, apart from unknown occupation the highest occupation was Domestic Service or Offices. In 1881 the majority of males in Smeeton Westerby either worked in Workers in Dress or Agriculture as they both scored the same of 30 people. In the 2001 census out of a possible 178 people in employment, 41 people were working in manufacturing of this roughly 73% were male.

25|$|The {{majority}} of Warwickshire's population {{live in the}} north and centre of the county. The market towns of northern and eastern Warwickshire were industrialised in the 19th century, and include Atherstone, Bedworth, Nuneaton, and Rugby. Of these, Atherstone has retained most of its original character. Major industries included coal mining, textiles, engineering and cement production, but heavy industry is in decline, being replaced by distribution centres, light to medium industry and services. Of the northern and eastern towns, only Nuneaton and Rugby (as the birthplace of rugby football) are well-known outside of Warwickshire. The prosperous towns of central and western Warwickshire including Royal Leamington Spa, Warwick, Stratford-upon-Avon, Kenilworth, Alcester and Wellesbourne harbour light to medium industries, services and tourism as major <b>employment</b> <b>sectors.</b>|$|E
25|$|Socially {{the island}} is highly diverse, with the {{creative}} sector (artists, musicians, scientists, writers, poets and actors) and eccentrics strongly represented. It has 1,206 businesses but around 1,000 people commute daily to Auckland as career opportunities are limited. 60.9 per cent of the residents are in employment. The main <b>employment</b> <b>sectors</b> are hospitality (23 per cent) and retail (15%) followed by education, agriculture/horticulture and healthcare (10% each). Gentrification and land speculation is having an impact, with high rates and mortgage interest rates forcing some people on fixed incomes to relocate. New Zealand council rates are based on land and building valuations, which take into account potential value for redevelopment even if the owners live on the property and have no intention to sell or redevelop. The cost of living is higher compared to the mainland, due to the shipping-freight costs of most foodstuffs, fuel and amenities.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} the employment status and choice of <b>employment</b> <b>sector</b> of female foreign spouses from Southeast Asia and Mainland China in Taiwan. The conceptual framework {{is based on}} the family labour supply model, human and social capital theory, and immigrant assimilation theory. Our findings indicate that in regard to employment status, family background variables, including the presence of small children and husbands' characteristics, play a more significant role in determining the employment probability for these foreign spouses than do human capital variables. In particular, for spouses from Southeast Asia, each additional child is correlated with a decrease in working probability of 11. 3 %, whereas college education has an insignificant effect on their employment probability. Employment assimilation for these marriage immigrants may be confirmed by the finding that the employment probability of foreign spouses rises rapidly with the number of years that have elapsed since migration. As for the choice of <b>employment</b> <b>sector,</b> a strong linkage between the <b>employment</b> <b>sector</b> of the foreign spouses and their husbands' <b>employment</b> <b>sector</b> is found in this study.

25|$|Belper's {{economy was}} {{traditionally}} reliant on manufacturing industry and numerous goods {{were made in}} the town. Cotton spinning and textile production were major employers virtually for much of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The large East Mill and the smaller North Mill are now all that remain of the industry and are preserved as part of the Derwent Valley Mills world heritage site. After the Second World War, J. W. Thornton, the chocolate maker, moved into the town from Sheffield, which helped to alleviate the employment problems arising from the contraction of the earlier industries. In recent years, the company completed a move to a new site a few miles away in Swanwick. Today, the main <b>employment</b> <b>sectors</b> are retail and services although some manufacturing industry remains. The main shopping area is centred on King Street. The town has two supermarkets, the Co-operative and Morrisons, and three discount shops, Poundland, B Bargains and the recently opened Aldi. The A6 road runs past the large redbrick Strutts Mill and on through the town's main through road, Bridge Street. On this street are the businesses of the Lion Hotel (an ancient coaching inn), an angling, gun and sports shop, a 24-hour petrol station, hairdressers and several restaurants.|$|E
