40|$|This thesis {{studied the}} {{maintenance}} data collection process of a container moving vehicle manufacturer, Kalmar. In addition, the data currently collected was analyzed {{in order to}} determine its usability for effective RAM analysis. To understand the data collection process Kalmar’s workshop in Vuosaari harbor, Helsinki Finland was visited and Kalmar reporting manuals explored. The process was found too heavy for effective maintenance reporting. To complete a work report, the system needs at least 100 inputs on the mouse or keyboard. Those inputs are across 35 screens so users spend much of their time moving from one screen to the next. The Vuosaari workshop reported that after adopting the system called SAP for maintenance reporting the time they spend on reporting has increased by 40 hours per month. It means they have one week less every month to spend on activities other than reporting. This is a huge increase in reporting time even if you take into consideration that during this time their maintenance work has experienced a growth of 25 %. The added time for reporting has not lead to high quality reports. The tools in SAP to input key parameters such as <b>hour</b> <b>counter</b> readings aren’t used, but instead open text fields are used. This is problematic for RAM analysis, because of the difficulty to effectively filter open text information. Thus effective RAM analysis is not viable since work orders have to be opened one at a time to collect the information. Moreover, the heavy process has led to other practices that decrease the usability of the data. One such practice is to open a single work order per month per machine and then write all the maintenance work done during the month under that same work order. This has the effect of hiding the true amount of failures the machines have experienced – unless the information is extracted by reading work reports one by one. To improve the usability of SAP, this thesis presents some choices. One approach is to redesign the layouts so only necessary inputs and few screens are needed. However, to achieve this, new software, such as SAP Screen Personas, is needed. Mobile reporting tools could help technicians report to SAP immediately after maintenance is complete or even during maintenance. Moreover, considering that it takes from 8 to 9 days to manage all the reporting activities during a month, the idea of hiring more help to specifically handle the reports should be considered as well...|$|E

40|$|Statistically, 8. 29 % {{of total}} number of {{vehicles}} seen on the Sri Lankan road network is heavy vehicles [5]. India dominates the Sri Lankan heavy vehicle market with a share of 50 % followed by other vehicle manufacturing countries [11]. When compared with its European, Japanese or German counterpart these Indian vehicles are specially designed for developing countries such as Sri Lanka. Most heavy vehicle manufactures do not give adequate consideration to provide an early warning system to help maintain heavy vehicle engines in good condition. Thus this research proposes such an early warning system which include fan belt condition indicator, alarm controlled engine cooling temperature indicator, vehicle loading weight indicator and automated method in keeping records of the engine oil changing period. The study {{has been carried out}} over one year period with selected vehicles from the Sri Lanka Navy, which possesses a massive heavy vehicle fleet and operates them frequently all over the Island. The proposals have been made by gathering information and analyzing data obtained from this fleet during its operation. The fan belt condition indicator provides an early warning by measuring the level of wear and tear of the fan belt. The conventional engine temperature indicator has been replaced with an electronic temperature sensor to provide real time engine temperature indicator. It also incorporates an alarm to warn of dangerously high temperatures to the vehicle operator. The weight of cargo loaded to the vehicle is measured through shockabsorber mounted displacement sensors, providing the operator with an accurate indication of the load on the vehicle prior to starting the journey. Further, an engine running <b>hours</b> <b>counter</b> provides an indication of actual engine running period, making it easy to identify proper time for oil changing. All the above features are consolidated in to a single display unit on the dashboard using electronic communication system. This unit called “Engine Quality Monitoring Unit” will greatly help the maintenance crew to prepare a proper maintenance schedule, fine tuned for each vehicle in the fleet...|$|R

40|$|The hammer throw {{is perhaps}} the most misunder-stood {{and one of the most}} {{difficult}} events to learn in track and field. It is in itself an enigma or paradox to even experienced coaches and athletes. I have long felt that two very important technical aspects of the hammer throw, namely relaxed extension of the arms to create maximum effective radius, and the notion of countering the hammer by sitting back against the ball, are quite paradoxical in nature. Think of the absurdity of trying to maintain a relatively relaxed, passive upper body with arms fully extended while driving furiously with your lower body and moving the hammer at speeds of up to 60 miles per <b>hour.</b> Likewise, to <b>counter</b> the weight of the hammer by sitting back (driving, fall backward with your back, head, buttocks and displacing your mass against the hammer) as the hammer head moves from 180 degrees to zero de-grees—which is a linear component of a mainly rotational event. It is at this point when the athlete should be sitting back against the ball that he has a tremendous urge to race ahead of the hammer into the next turn (known as drag-ging), thus slowing down the hammer’s speed and de-creasing effective radius. When sitting back against the hammer is successfully applied, it has the effect of dra-matically increasing the speed of the hammer and gives the athlete a tremendous sense of control, albeit paradoxi-cally, by falling, sitting back against the hammer. TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT: COACH PARADOXICALLY How do you effectively teach these two difficult-to-learn concepts that are required for successful hammer throwing?

This dissertation {{consists of two}} essays. The first essay revisits a fundamen- tal puzzle for productivity driven business cycle theories. A challenge for these models of business cycles is that labor productivity and hours are neg- atively correlated in the United States, whereas the theory predicts a strong positive correlation. I refine the empirical puzzle and provide a theory to account for it. I emphasize that hours per worker and individual hours relative to usual <b>hours</b> move <b>counter</b> to productivity. In the cross-section, I find that almost all workers increase their hours when productivity is low, except for low (residual) wage earners. Furthermore, low wage earners suffer larger wage losses when productivity falls. Based on these findings, I hypothesize that non-neutral movements in productivity exacerbate fric- tions due to adverse selection. I use recent advances in competitive search theory to imbed Akerlof's Rat Race into a Neo-Classical growth model with search frictions. Firms bundle high earnings with long hours in order to separate more able and willing workers from the less productive. When low productivity workers fall (relatively) farther behind, the firm requires longer hours from everyone else; perversely, many workers work harder even as {{the market value of}} their time falls. A calibrated version of the model is used to measure the aggregate volatility generated by productivity shocks when labor markets are burdened by adverse selection. In the second essay, my coauthor Jacob Short and I study the behavior of entrepreneurs {{in order to understand the}} sources and magnitude of risks that they face. Entrepreneurship is risky; entrepreneurs forgo wages and invest their time and resources into a business with large potential gains, but uninsurable risks. It is vital to know the extent of these risks, and the insurance available against them, in order to assess corporate tax and personal bankruptcy reforms. We document that incorporated entrepreneurs operate larger businesses, accumulate more wealth, and are on average more productive than unincorporated entrepreneurs. We embed the U. S. bankruptcy and incorporation legal systems in a quantitative macroeconomic theory of occupation, incorporation, and default choices that accounts for the cross-sectional facts. In the model, as in the U. S., incorporation provides insurance via limited liability beyond personal bankruptcy exemptions, at the expense of administrative burdens and an endogenous interest rate premium. Our model suggests that capital embodied shocks are important entrepreneurial risks. A calibrated economy in which each unit of installed capital entails a small probability of a catastrophic shock (full de-struction of capital) is able to account for the data along multiple untargeted dimensions. We find the welfare gains for entrepreneurs from eliminating investment risk are huge (5. 9 % increase in annual consumption). And, the welfare loss from removing limited liability appears to be large...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Most sleep loss research has concentrated on long duration, repeated measures performance of low-level, monotonous tasks, such as vigilance and reaction time, {{in support of the}} theory that sleep loss induces a decline in Non-Specific arousal while having no specific effects on functioning. Numerous studies have shown the beneficial effects of caffeine on this type of performance measure. Recent studies have been conducted on executive functioning tasks that are short, novel, and stimulating. These measures display a sensitivity to sleep loss after 36 h that is not compensated by waking countermeasures such as motivation and caffeine. These findings suggest Specific effects of sleep loss, contrary to the Non-Specific theory, particularly on tasks associated with frontal lobe activation. Similarities between performance deficits following brain lesions and those observed in sleep loss subjects form the basis of a neuropsychological model of sleep function. This thesis was an endeavour to document the findings of executive functioning sensitivity following 27 and 36 hours of sleep loss, testing the effect of two common countermeasures, caffeine and a nap. It was established that the critical period of sleep loss for executive functioning performance is at 36 hours. Sleep deprivation effects for periods shorter than 36 <b>hours</b> can be <b>countered</b> by a waking countermeasure, caffeine. It was further established that a 2 -hour prophylactic nap opportunity inhibited sleep deprivation effects at 36 -hr performance testing for executive functions. The systematic analysis of the effects of sleep loss on language skill, a complex task which is possibly an executive functioning task associated with frontal lobe activation but largely neglected in the literature, detected an increase in variability in language skill, and a propensity towards production errors in speech, but not writing, at 36 hours without sleep. This effect was not observed at 27 hours. The findings are discussed in support of a hypothetical consolidated model of Specific and Non-Specific Effects of sleep loss...|$|R
