40|$|MEOSS is {{a single}} optics and single {{spectral}} band camera. Three CCD's working in pushbroom mode are mounted perpendicular to the flight direction on a common focal plate. Their oblique views of + and - 23 degrees forward and backward, as well as nadir oriented, lead to threefold stereoscopic images. This principle allows a nearly simultaneous generation of all three images of a stereo triplet. The time gap between the <b>forward</b> and <b>aft</b> <b>looking</b> images guarantees constant illumination conditions. The ground resolution of MEOSS will be 52 by 80 m ground pixel size, height resolution of 55 m and swath width of 255 km. The drifting ground coverage pattern of MEOSS is unique compared to polar orbiting satellites and will allow images of an area to be taken {{at different times of}} the day. A scene will consist of 3144 scan lines, with each having 3236 pixels. The data will be received by the Deep Space Network of JPL Goldstone and mailed to Goddard...|$|R

6000|$|The Start, and {{the point}} to the westward of it, were still to be cleared. They were a good way off, and but a little to leeward, as the ship headed. In smooth water, and with a whole-sail breeze, {{it would have been}} easy enough to lay past the Start, when at the Eddystone, with a {{south-west}} wind; but, in a gale, it is a serious matter, especially on a flood-tide. I know all hands of us, <b>forward</b> and <b>aft,</b> <b>looked</b> upon our situation as very grave. We passed several uneasy hours, after we lost sight of the Eddystone, before we got a view of the land near the Start. When I saw it, the heights appeared like a dark cloud hanging over us, and I certainly thought the ship was gone. At this time, the captain and mate consulted together, and the latter came to us, in a very calm, steady manner, and said--"Come, boys; we may as well go ashore without masts as with them, and our only hope is in getting more canvass to stand. We must turn-to, and make sail on the ship." ...|$|R

40|$|The Norwegian {{export price}} for an {{aggregated}} commodity is modelled assuming price-setting behaviour. The {{focus is on}} the choice between backward- and <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> models. The dynamics is modelled according to three different approaches; a backward looking error correction model and two <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> models where rational expectations are assumed. The first <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> model is derived from a multiperiod quadratic loss function imposing backward-forward restrictions on the parameters. The results from this specification are not encouraging. We then allow data to choose the lead structure, resulting in a less restrictive <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> model. The backward- and <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> models are compared to an estimated cointegrating vector for the long-run solution. An encompassing test on the backward- and <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> model indicates that further research should look for a model that encompasses both of them.

40|$|The <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> radar imaging task is a {{practical}} and challenging problem for adverse weather aircraft landing industry. Deconvolution method can realize the <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> imaging but it often leads to the noise amplification in the radar image. In this paper, a <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> radar imaging based on deconvolution method is presented for adverse weather aircraft landing. We first present the theoretical background of <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> radar imaging task and its application for aircraft landing. Then, we convert the <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> radar imaging task into a corresponding deconvolution problem, which is solved {{in the framework of}} algebraic theory using truncated singular decomposition method. The key issue regarding the selecting of the truncated parameter is addressed using generalized cross validation approach. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in achieving angular resolution enhancement with suppressing the noise amplification in <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> radar imaging...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{advances}} in robotics and imaging technologies have brought various imaging devices {{to the field}} of the unmanned exploration of new environments. <b>Forward</b> <b>looking</b> sonar is one of the newly emerging imaging methods employed in the exploration of underwater environments. While the video sequences produced by <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> sonar systems are characterized by low signal-to-noise ratio, low resolution and limited range of sight, it is expected that video enhancement techniques will facilitate the interpretation of the video sequences. Since the video enhancement techniques for <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> sonar video sequences are applicable to most of the <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> sonar sequences, the development of such techniques is more crucial than developing techniques for optical camera video enhancement, where only specially produced video sequences can benefit the techniques. In this paper, we introduce a procedure to enhance <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> sonar video sequences via incorporating the knowledge of the target object obtained in previously observed frames. The proposed procedure includes inter-frame registration, linearization of image intensity, and maximum a posteriori fusion of images in the video sequence. The performance of this procedure is verified by enhancing video sequences of Dual-frequency Identification Sonar (DIDSON), the market leading <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> sonar system. ...|$|R
40|$|The Rational Addiction (RA) model {{assumes that}} {{individual}} {{decisions about the}} consumption of harmful and addictive commodities are made on a rational basis (Becker and Murphy, 1988). In this context, rational means <b>forward</b> <b>looking,</b> i. e. a tendency {{to take account of}} future consequences of current consumption decisions. Different individuals may well attach different weights to the present relative to the future. The degree to which an individual is <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> in her consumption decisions is revealed not by her current consumption level but rather by the time path of her consumption of an addictive commodity. Hence, the need to estimate a <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> second order difference equation (SODE) as {{part of the process of}} testing the RA model. Most studies using micro level data estimate a single SODE for the whole sample. This involves estimating an average propensity to be <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> for the entire sample, even when it is believed that different fully rational individuals in the same sample may have different propensities to be <b>forward</b> <b>looking.</b> <b>Forward</b> <b>looking</b> behaviour is an aspect of treating the consumption of an addictive commodity as part of an inter-temporal optimization problem. Inter-temporal optimization is characterized by what are known as saddle point dynamics and the information about an individual’s propensity to be <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> is contained in what are known as the characteristic roots of the equation (Ferguson, 2003). In a sample of heterogeneous individuals we expect propensity to be <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> to differ across individuals and the best way to identify these differences is by looking at the dynamic behaviour of the individual consumption paths. Estimating a common SODE for everyone hides this key difference. In this paper, we make the argument that the best place to look for differences in individual propensities to be <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> is in dynamic behaviour considered at different points in the distribution of the consumption of an addictive commodity. To do this we adopt techniques of Quantile Regression, (QR) estimating RA type difference equations in consumption across quantiles of cigarette consumption. We use panel data to ensure that we are examining the behaviour of individuals across time. Our hypothesis is that we will find differences in the degree of <b>forward</b> <b>looking</b> behaviour characterizing the time paths of consumption across quantiles in the micro-level data. ...|$|R

Results are presented from processing of an oceanic data set from an 87 kHz US Navy <b>forward</b> <b>look</b> imaging sonar using the stochastic mapping method for CML. The goal is to detect objects on the seabed, map their locations, and concurrently compute an improved trajectory for the vehicle. The resulting trajectory is compared with position estimates computed with an inertial navigation system and Doppler velocity sonar. The results demonstrate the potential of concurrent mapping and localization algorithms to satisfy the navigation requirements of undersea vehicles equipped with <b>forward</b> <b>look</b> sonar. ...|$|R
