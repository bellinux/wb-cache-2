5000|$|The {{concept of}} Earthquake Duration Magnitude - {{originally}} proposed by Bisztricsany in 1958 using surface waves only - {{is based on}} the realization that on a recorded earthquake seismogram, the total length of the seismic wavetrain - sometimes referred to as the CODA - reflects its size. Thus larger earthquakes give longer seismograms well as stronger seismic waves than small ones. The seismic wave interval measured on the time axis of an <b>earthquake</b> <b>record</b> - starting with the first seismic wave onset until the wavetrain amplitude diminishes to at least 10% of its maximum recorded value - is referred to as [...] "earthquake duration". It is this concept that Bisztricsany first used to develop his Earthquake Duration Magnitude Scale employing surface wave durations.|$|E

Research by Ted Scambos, of the National Snow and Ice Data Center, has {{supported}} the melt water fracturing theory that suggests the melting process associated with melt ponds has a substantial effect on ice shelf disintegration. Seasonal melt ponded and penetrating under glaciers shows seasonal acceleration and deceleration of ice flows affecting whole icesheets. Accumulated changes by ponding on ice sheets appear in the <b>earthquake</b> <b>record</b> of Greenland and other glaciers: [...] "Quakes ranged from six to 15 per year from 1993 to 2002, then jumped to 20 in 2003, 23 in 2004, and 32 in the first 10 months of 2005."

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the sequence of}} great earthquakes over the past century. To examine whether the <b>earthquake</b> <b>record</b> includes temporal clustering, we identify aftershocks and remove those from the record. We focus on the recurrence time, defined as the time between two consecutive earthquakes. We study {{the variance in the}} recurrence time and the maximal recurrence time. Using these quantities, we compare the <b>earthquake</b> <b>record</b> with sequences of random events, generated by numerical simulations, while systematically varying the minimal earthquake magnitude Mmin. Our analysis shows that the <b>earthquake</b> <b>record</b> is consistent with a random process for magnitude thresholds 7. 0 <=Mmin<= 8. 3, where the number of events is larger. Interestingly, the <b>earthquake</b> <b>record</b> deviates from a random process at magnitude threshold 8. 4 <=Mmin<= 8. 5, where the number of events is smaller; however, this deviation is not strong enough to conclude that great earthquakes are clustered. Overall, the findings are robust both qualitatively and quantitatively as statistics of extreme values and moment analysis yield remarkably similar results. Comment: 5 pages, 6 figure...|$|E

Moreover, seismic motions of earthquakes exceeding the JMA magnitude MJMA 6.5 are excluded from analysis to remove <b>earthquake</b> <b>records</b> with significant long period contribution through the excitation of basin-induced or basin-transduced surface waves, since our simple theoretical EHVR formula is derived by considering only body waves.|$|R

40|$|A {{simplified}} method for synthesizing spatially correlated earthquake ground motions is developed based on Hilbert transform and a reference <b>earthquake</b> <b>record.</b> In this method, one reference <b>earthquake</b> <b>record</b> {{is treated as}} the original ground motion, based {{on a series of}} generated ground motions. This procedure uses the instantaneous amplitude and the instantaneous phase of the record obtained using Hilbert transform to achieve the nonstationarity of ground motion. To establish the coherency between generated ground motions, an incoherence model is employed to describe the relation between the instantaneous phase at the present station and the instantaneous phases at previous stations. This type of phase is defined as the instantaneous coherence phase. In addition, time lag is included in the instantaneous coherence phase to prescribe the wave passage effect. The proposed Hilbert-transform-based method is efficient and avoids cumbersome parameter estimations as well as other drawbacks involved in some traditional synthesizing methods. Applications of this method demonstrate that the generated ground motions are statistically analogous with the reference record...|$|E

By such approximation, the dynamic analysis of the structure is not necessary if the structural properties are changed. Both feedforward neural networks and wavelet decompositions inspire this network. An algorithm of backpropagation type is proposed for training the network. In this network, the input is the damping ratio and the angular natural frequency of the structure and the output is the responses of the structures against these reduced points.

40|$|Since {{there is}} no closed-form formula for {{designing}} TMD (Tuned Mass Damper) for nonlinear structures, some researchers have proposed numerical optimization procedures such as a genetic algorithm to obtain the optimal values of TMD parameters for nonlinear structures. These methods are based on determining the optimal values of TMD parameters to minimize the maximum response (e. g. inter story drift) of the controlled structure subjected to a specific <b>earthquake</b> <b>record.</b> Therefore, the performance of TMD that has been designed using a specific record strongly depends {{on the characteristics of}} the <b>earthquake</b> <b>record.</b> By changing the characteristics of the input <b>earthquake</b> <b>record,</b> the efficiency of TMD is changed and in some cases, {{it is possible that the}} response of the controlled structure is increased. To overcome the shortcomings of the previous researches, in this paper, an efficient method for designing optimal TMD on nonlinear structures is proposed, in which the effect of different ground motion records is considered in the design procedure. In the proposed method, the optimal value of the TMD parameters are determined so that the average maximum response (e. g. inter story drift) resulting from different records in the controlled structure is minimized. To illustrate the procedure of the propose method, the method is used to design optimal TMD for a sample structure. The results of numerical simulations show that the average maximum response of controlled structure resulting from different records is reduced significantly. Hence, it can be concluded that the proposed method for designing optimal TMD under different earthquakes is effective...|$|E

40|$|Earthquake {{duration}} is {{the total}} time of ground shaking from the arrival of seismic waves until the return to ambient conditions. Much of this time is at relatively low shaking levels which have little effect on seismic structural response and on earthquake damage potential. As a result, a parameter termed ``strong motion duration`` has been defined {{by a number of}} investigators to be used for the purpose of evaluating seismic response and assessing the potential for structural damage due to earthquakes. This report presents methods for determining strong motion duration and a time history envelope function appropriate for various evaluation purposes, for earthquake magnitude and distance, and for site soil properties. There are numerous definitions of strong motion duration. For most of these definitions, empirical studies have been completed which relate duration to earthquake magnitude and distance and to site soil properties. Each of these definitions recognizes that only the portion of an <b>earthquake</b> <b>record</b> which has sufficiently high acceleration amplitude, energy content, or some other parameters significantly affects seismic response.
