25|$|For the {{majority}} of tests, blood is usually obtained from the patient's vein. Other specialized tests, such as the arterial blood gas test, require blood extracted from an artery. Blood <b>gas</b> <b>analysis</b> of arterial blood is primarily used to monitor carbon dioxide and oxygen levels related to pulmonary function, but {{is also used to}} measure blood pH and bicarbonate levels for certain metabolic conditions.|$|E

25|$|When {{signs of}} {{pneumonia}} are discovered during evaluation, chest X-rays, are performed {{to support a}} diagnosis of CAP, and examination of the blood and sputum for infectious microorganisms and blood tests {{may be used to}} support a diagnosis of CAP. Diagnostic tools depend on the severity of illness, local practices and concern about complications of the infection. All patients with CAP should have their blood oxygen monitored with pulse oximetry. In some cases, arterial blood <b>gas</b> <b>analysis</b> may be required to determine the amount of oxygen in the blood. A complete blood count (CBC) may reveal extra white blood cells, indicating infection.|$|E

Among these were the recognition of iron as a constituent of urine, and the observation that the colour of normal human urine was due to urobilin. While at Heidelberg Harley studied in Robert Bunsen's laboratory the methods of <b>gas</b> <b>analysis.</b> After his return to England he made researches on the chemistry of respiration. Some of the results {{were published in the}} Philosophical Transactions. He read at the Leeds meeting of the British Association in 1858 a paper in which he showed that pancreatin was capable of digesting both starchy and albuminous substances. In 1862 he received the triennial prize of the Royal College of Surgeons of England for his researches into the anatomy and physiology of the suprarenal bodies.|$|E

METHODS:This was an exploratory, descriptive and cross-sectional study with 26 newborns submitted to blood <b>gases</b> <b>analysis</b> and admitted to a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Data were collected in April and May 2010, by means of an identification form and physiological changes presented by newborns before and during the procedure. RESULTS:There have been newborn facial manifestations of pain (100 %), heart rate changes (50 %) and decreased oxygen saturation (34. 7 %). CONCLUSION:When physiological parameters were compared before and during arterial puncture, there have been pain facial manifestations in all newborns as well as physiological changes such as decreased oxygen saturation levels and increased heart rate, according to the Neonatal Facial Activity Coding scale, showing that, although unable to verbalize, newborns are able to show changes expressing the pain felt at arterial puncture. The application of this scale was especially important for favoring sensitization and a holistic nursing care for painful newborns...|$|R
