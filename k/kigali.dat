5|$|On 7 April, Kagame {{warned the}} {{committee}} and UNAMIR that he would resume the civil war if the killing did not stop. The next day, the Rwandan government forces attacked the national parliament building from several directions, but the RPF troops stationed there successfully fought back; Kagame began an attack from the north on three fronts, seeking to link up quickly with the troops isolated in <b>Kigali.</b> An interim government was set up but Kagame {{refused to talk to}} it, believing that it was just a cover for Bagosora's rule. Over the next few days, the RPF advanced steadily south, capturing Gabiro and large areas of countryside to the north and east of <b>Kigali.</b> They avoided attacking <b>Kigali</b> or Byumba at this stage, but conducted manoeuvres designed to encircle the cities and cut off supply routes.

5|$|Throughout April {{there were}} {{numerous}} attempts by UNAMIR to establish a ceasefire, but Kagame insisted each time that the RPF would not stop fighting unless the killings stopped. In late April, the RPF secured {{the whole of the}} Tanzanian border area and began to move west from Kibungo, to the south of <b>Kigali.</b> They encountered little resistance, except around <b>Kigali</b> and Ruhengeri. By 16 May they had cut the road between <b>Kigali</b> and Gitarama, the temporary home of the interim government, and by 13 June, had taken Gitarama itself. The taking of Gitarama followed an unsuccessful attempt by the FAR forces to reopen the road. The interim government was forced to relocate to Gisenyi in the far northwest. As well as fighting the war, Kagame recruited heavily at this time to expand the RPF. The new recruits included Tutsi survivors of the genocide and refugees from Burundi, but they were less well trained and disciplined than the earlier recruits.|$|E

5|$|The present borders {{were drawn}} in 2006 {{with the aim}} of decentralising power and {{removing}} associations with the old system and the genocide. The previous structure of twelve provinces associated with the largest cities was replaced with five provinces based primarily on geography. These are Northern Province, Southern Province, Eastern Province, Western Province, and the Municipality of <b>Kigali</b> in the centre.|$|E
5|$|When {{news of the}} RPF {{offensive}} broke, Habyarimana requested {{assistance from}} France in fighting the invasion. The French president's son, Jean-Christophe Mitterrand, {{was head of the}} government's Africa Cell, and promised to send troops. On the night of 4 October, the Rwandan government staged a fake RPF attack on <b>Kigali</b> with gunfire and explosions around the city, seeking to convince the French that the regime was in imminent danger. The deception worked, and 600 French soldiers arrived in Rwanda the following day, double the number initially pledged. The French operation was code-named Noroît, and its official purpose was to protect French nationals. In reality, the mission was to support Habyarimana's regime, and the French parachute companies immediately set up positions blocking the RPF advance to the capital and <b>Kigali</b> International Airport. In addition to the French, Belgium and Zaire sent troops to <b>Kigali</b> in early October. The Belgian presence was short-lived, its troops withdrawing within two weeks because of laws preventing the army from intervening in a civil war. Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko's contribution was to send several hundred troops of the elite Special Presidential Division (DSP). Unlike the French, the Zairian troops went straight to the front line and began fighting the RPF, but their discipline was poor. The Zairian soldiers raped Rwandan civilians in the north of the country and looted their homes, prompting Habyarimana to expel them back to Zaire within a week of their arrival.|$|E
5|$|Another one-party cabinet was {{announced}} in January 1992, which prompted large scale protests in <b>Kigali,</b> and finally forced Habyarimana to make real concessions. He promised {{for the first time}} to negotiate with the RPF; a multiparty cabinet formed in April, still dominated by the MRND, but with opposition figures in some key positions. The opposition members of this cabinet met with the RPF, and were successful in negotiating a ceasefire. In July 1992 the rebels agreed to stop fighting, and the parties began a peace negotiation process headquartered in the Tanzanian city of Arusha.|$|E
5|$|Peace {{negotiations}} resumed in Arusha, and {{the resulting}} set of agreements, known as the Arusha Accords, were signed in August 1993. The RPF were given positions in a broad-based transitional government (BBTG) and in the national army. The United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), a peacekeeping force, arrived and the RPF were given a base in the national parliament building in <b>Kigali</b> to use during {{the establishment of the}} BBTG.|$|E
5|$|The RPF advance caused {{panic in}} France, which had long {{supported}} the Habyarimana regime. Several hundred French troops were immediately dispatched to Rwanda, along with arms and ammunition, {{to bolster the}} FAR forces. The arrival of these French troops in <b>Kigali</b> significantly changed the military situation on the ground. The RPF now found themselves under attack, with French shells bombarding them as they advanced southwards.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} his schooling Kagame made two visits to Rwanda, in 1977 and 1978. He was initially hosted {{by family members}} of his former classmates, but upon arrival in <b>Kigali</b> he made contact with {{members of his own}} family. He kept a low profile on these visits, believing that his status as a well-connected Tutsi exile could lead to arrest; on his second visit he entered the country through Zaire rather than Uganda to avoid suspicion. Kagame used his time in Rwanda to explore the country, familiarise himself with the political and social situation, and make connections that would prove useful to him in his later activities.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} year, the RPF waged a classic {{hit-and-run}} style guerrilla war, capturing some border areas but not making significant {{gains in the}} war against the Rwandan army. Following the June 1992 formation of a multi-party coalition government in <b>Kigali,</b> Kagame announced a ceasefire and initiated negotiations with the Rwandan government in Arusha, Tanzania. In early 1993 groups of extremist Hutu formed and began campaigns of large-scale violence against the Tutsi. Kagame responded by suspending peace talks temporarily and launching a major attack, gaining a large swathe of land across the north of the country.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, 220 coffee growers {{formed an}} {{association}} in the Maraba district (part {{of the former}} Butare Province) to tackle this problem. Many of these farmers had lost family members during the 1994 genocide, while others had husbands in prison, accused of participating in the killings and due to face trial in the traditional gacaca courts. They named the association Abahuzamugambi, a Kinyarwanda word for people who work together to achieve a goal. The farmers hoped that by forming the association, they would increase revenue by selling directly to exporters in <b>Kigali</b> instead of through an intermediary transport company. They divided their profits and used them to buy tools, fertilisers and seeds to increase yields.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{the mayor}} of Maraba {{requested}} development aid from the National University of Rwanda (UNR), based in nearby Butare; the following year UNR helped found the Partnership for Enhancing Agriculture in Rwanda through Linkages (PEARL). Several entities supported the PEARL project: USAID, Michigan State University, Texas A University and various Rwandan bodies including UNR, the national agricultural research institute (ISAR) and the <b>Kigali</b> Institute of Science, Technology and Management (KIST). PEARL started working with Abahuzamugambi in February 2001 to improve the coffee quality to standards required by the specialty coffee market in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to deceiving the French, the Rwandan government used the fake attack on <b>Kigali</b> on 4 October as the pretext for launching {{a wave of}} anti-Tutsi propaganda. They encouraged Hutu citizens to arrest Tutsi suspected of supporting the RPF. With French assistance, and benefiting {{from the loss of}} RPF morale after Rwigyema's death, the FAR enjoyed a major tactical advantage. By the end of October they had regained all the ground taken by the RPF, and pushed the rebels {{all the way back to}} the Ugandan border. Many soldiers deserted; some crossed back into Uganda, while others went into hiding in the Akagera National Park. The Rwandan government announced on 30 October that the war was over.|$|E
5|$|On 6 April 1994, Rwandan President Habyarimana's {{plane was}} shot down near <b>Kigali</b> Airport, killing both Habyarimana and the President of Burundi, Cyprien Ntaryamira, {{as well as their}} entourage and three French crew members. The attackers remain unknown. Historian Gérard Prunier, in a book written shortly after the incident, {{concluded}} that it was most likely a coup d'État carried out by extreme Hutu members of Habyarimana's government, and was a planned part of the genocide. This theory was disputed in 2006 by French judge Jean-Louis Bruguière, and in 2008 by Spanish judge Fernando Andreu. Both alleged that Kagame and the RPF were responsible.|$|E
5|$|The post-genocide Rwandan {{government}} {{took office in}} <b>Kigali</b> in July 1994. It was based loosely on the Arusha Accords, but Habyarimana's party, MRND was outlawed. The positions it had been assigned were {{taken over by the}} RPF. The military wing of the RPF was renamed as the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA), and became the national army. Paul Kagame assumed the dual roles of Vice President of Rwanda and Minister of Defence while Pasteur Bizimungu, a Hutu who had been a civil servant under Habyarimana before fleeing to join the RPF, was appointed president. Bizimungu and his cabinet had some control over domestic affairs, but Kagame remained commander-in-chief of the army and was the de facto ruler of the country.|$|E
5|$|At , Rwanda's {{population}} density is amongst {{the highest in}} Africa. Historians such as Gérard Prunier believe that the 1994 genocide can be partly attributed to the {{population density}}. The population is predominantly rural, with a few large towns; dwellings are evenly spread throughout the country. The only sparsely populated {{area of the country}} is the savanna land in the former province of Umutara and Akagera National Park in the east. <b>Kigali</b> is the largest city, with a population of around one million. Its rapidly increasing population challenges its infrastructural development. According to the 2012 census, the second largest city is Gisenyi, which lies adjacent to Lake Kivu and the Congolese city of Goma, and has a population of 126,000. Other major towns include Ruhengeri, Butare, and Gitarama, all with populations below 100,000. The urban population rose from 6% of the population in 1990, to 16.6% in 2006; by 2011, however, the proportion had dropped slightly, to 14.8%.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), a rebel group {{composed}} of nearly 500,000 Tutsi refugees, invaded northern Rwanda from their base in Uganda, initiating the Rwandan Civil War. The group condemned the Hutu-dominated government {{for failing to}} democratize and confront the problems facing these refugees. Neither side was able to gain a decisive advantage in the war, but by 1992 it had weakened Habyarimana's authority; mass demonstrations forced him into a coalition with the domestic opposition and eventually to sign the 1993 Arusha Accords with the RPF. The cease-fire ended on 6 April 1994 when Habyarimana's plane was shot down near <b>Kigali</b> Airport, killing him. The shooting down of the plane served as the catalyst for the Rwandan Genocide, which began within a few hours. Over the course of approximately 100 days, between 500,000 and 1,000,000 Tutsi and politically moderate Hutu were killed in well-planned attacks on the orders of the interim government. Many Twa were also killed, despite not being directly targeted.|$|E
5|$|In {{the run-up}} to the election, there was some {{violence}} and several incidents involving prominent opposition and media figures. In February, there was a grenade attack in <b>Kigali</b> which killed two people. Rwandan prosecutors blamed Kayumba Nyamwasa, a dissident General who had become a critic of Kagame. Nywamwasa fled to Johannesburg, South Africa, and in June he survived a shooting in the city. Nyamwasa alleged that it was an assassination attempt, a charge Rwanda denied. Days later, journalist Jean-Léonard Rugambage, who claimed to have uncovered the regime's responsibility in the attempted murder, was shot dead. In July, {{the vice president of the}} Democratic Green Party, André Kagwa Rwisereka, was beheaded in Butare. There is no concrete evidence linking Kagame with the attacks, but it was sufficient for the United Nations to demand an investigation.|$|E
5|$|Kagame's {{first term}} expired and new {{elections}} {{were held in}} 2010. Having served one term as elected president, Kagame was entitled to serve for one further term. The election campaign began publicly in January 2010 when Victoire Ingabire, a Hutu who had been living abroad for some years, returned to Rwanda and announced her candidacy for the presidency. This failed as she was arrested and accused of threatening state security. Ingabire caused some controversy in the country following her arrival, with comments relating to the genocide. The government accused her of breaking the country's strict laws regarding genocide denial, and she was arrested in April 2010. She was released on bail, but was prohibited from running in the election. In October 2012 she was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment by the High Court of <b>Kigali,</b> which is heavily criticized by Amnesty International.|$|E
5|$|Maraba {{coffee is}} {{grown in the}} south of Rwanda at {{coordinates}} , roughly 12kilometres (7mi) from Butare and 150kilometres (93mi) from the capital, <b>Kigali.</b> The project began in the Maraba District of Butare Province, but these entities were replaced under local government organisation in 2006, and the area is now part of Huye District in the Southern Province. The area is very hilly, due to its proximity to the Western Rift Valley and the montane Nyungwe Forest, and features rich volcanic soils. The coffee is grown at altitudes between 1,700 and 2,100 metres (5,577–6,889ft) above sea level, often on steep hillsides with terrace farming. The area experiences an average of 115centimetres (45in) of rainfall annually. The majority of this falls during the rainy season of March to May, the major coffee harvesting season. The high altitude lowers the temperature slightly to an average of about 20 °C (68 °F). There is little seasonal variation.|$|E
5|$|On 2 October the RPF {{suffered}} a significant reversal, when leader Fred Rwigyema {{was shot in}} the head and killed. There is a dispute about the exact circumstances of Rwigyema's death; the official line of Kagame's government, and the version mentioned by historian Gérard Prunier in his 1995 book on the subject, was that Rwigyema was killed by a stray bullet. In his 2009 book Africa's World War, however, Prunier states that it is likely Rwigyema was killed by his subcommander Peter Bayingana, following an argument over tactics. According to this account, Rwigyema was conscious of the need to move slowly, and attempt to win over the Hutu in Rwanda before assaulting <b>Kigali,</b> whereas Bayingana and fellow subcommander Chris Bunyenyezi, wished to strike hard and fast, to achieve power as soon as possible; the argument boiled over, causing Bayingana to shoot Rwigyema dead. Another senior RPF officer, Stephen Nduguta, witnessed this shooting and informed President Museveni; Museveni sent his brother Salim Saleh to investigate, and Saleh ordered Bayingana and Bunyenyezi's arrest and eventual execution.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{principal}} RPF targets in Ruhengeri was the prison, which was Rwanda's largest. When he learned of the invasion the warden, Charles Uwihoreye, telephoned the government in <b>Kigali,</b> to request instructions. He spoke to Colonel Elie Sagatwa, one of the akazu, who ordered him to kill every inmate in the prison, to avoid escape and defections during the fighting, and to prevent high-profile political prisoners and former insiders from sharing secret information with the RPF. Uwihoreye refused to obey, even after Sagatwa called him to repeat the order, having confirmed it with the president. Eventually the RPF stormed the buildings, and the prisoners were saved. Several prisoners were recruited into the RPF, including Theoneste Lizinde, a former close ally of President Habyarimana, who had been arrested following a failed coup attempt in 1980.|$|E
5|$|She-Amavubi debuted on 16 January 2014, in the 2014 African Women's Championship first {{qualification}} round, against Kenya in the Stade Régional Nyamirambo in <b>Kigali.</b> They won 1–0 from a goal {{scored by}} Alice Niyoyita at the 29th minute {{in the first}} leg. In the second leg in Kenyatta Stadium, Machakos, Kenya they lost 2–1 with the solitary goal scored by Jeanne Nyirahatashima. Rwanda qualified for the second round by the away goals rule after finishing 2–2 on aggregate and played against Nigeria. Their third official match was disputed on 13 May 2014 against Zambia and ended in a 3–0 loss, making it the third loss of their record. They disputed the 2014 African Women's Championship second qualification round with Nigeria on 24 May 2014, losing 4–1. The goal was scored by Clementine Mukamana at the 53rd minute. In the second leg, again competing against Nigeria on 7 June 2014, the She-Amavubi lost by a crushing 8–0 defeat, leaving {{them out of the}} 2014 African Women's Championship by a 12–1 aggregate score.|$|E
5|$|Subsistence crops {{grown in}} the country include matoke (green bananas), which occupy {{more than a third}} of the country's farmland, potatoes, beans, sweet potatoes, cassava, wheat and maize. Coffee and tea are the major cash crops for export, with the high altitudes, steep slopes and {{volcanic}} soils providing favourable conditions. Reports, have established that more than 400,000 Rwandans, make their living from coffee plantation. Reliance on agricultural exports makes Rwanda vulnerable to shifts in their prices. Animals raised in Rwanda include cows, goats, sheep, pigs, chicken, and rabbits, with geographical variation in the numbers of each. Production systems are mostly traditional, although there are a few intensive dairy farms around <b>Kigali.</b> Shortages of land and water, insufficient and poor-quality feed, and regular disease epidemics with insufficient veterinary services are major constraints that restrict output. Fishing takes place on the country's lakes, but stocks are very depleted, and live fish are being imported in an attempt to revive the industry.|$|E
5|$|The {{cease-fire}} ended abruptly on 6 April 1994, when President Habyarimana's {{plane was}} shot down near <b>Kigali</b> Airport, killing both Habyarimana and the new President of Burundi, Cyprien Ntaryamira. The pair were returning home from a regional summit in Dar es Salaam, at which the leaders of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania had urged Habyarimana to stop delaying {{the implementation of the}} Arusha accords. The attackers remain unknown. Prunier, in his book written shortly after the incident, concluded that it was most likely a coup d'État carried out by extreme Hutu members of Habyarimana's government. This theory was disputed in 2006 by French judge Jean-Louis Bruguière, and in 2008 by Spanish judge Fernando Andreu. Both alleged that Kagame and the RPF were responsible. At the end of 2010 the French government ordered a more thorough judicial inquiry, which employed ballistics experts. This report reaffirmed the initial theory that Hutu extremists assassinated Habyarimana.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{radio and}} {{television}} stations are state-run, {{and the majority of}} newspapers are owned by the government. Most Rwandans have access to radio; during the 1994 genocide, the radio station Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines broadcast across the country, and helped to fuel the killings through anti-Tutsi propaganda. , the state-run Radio Rwanda is the largest station and the main source of news throughout the country. Television access is limited, with most homes not having their own set. The government rolled out digital television in 2014, and a year later there were seven national stations operating, up from just one in the pre-2014 analogue era. The press is tightly restricted, and newspapers routinely self-censor to avoid government reprisals. Nonetheless, publications in Kinyarwanda, English, and French critical of the government are widely available in <b>Kigali.</b> Restrictions were increased {{in the run-up to the}} Rwandan presidential election of 2010, with two independent newspapers, Umuseso and Umuvugizi, being suspended for six months by the High Media Council.|$|E
5|$|Rwanda has a {{temperate}} tropical highland climate, {{with lower}} temperatures than are typical for equatorial countries {{because of its}} high elevation. <b>Kigali,</b> in {{the centre of the}} country, has a typical daily temperature range between , with little variation through the year. There are some temperature variations across the country; the mountainous west and north are generally cooler than the lower-lying east. There are two rainy seasons in the year; the first runs from February to June and the second from September to December. These are separated by two dry seasons: the major one from June to September, during which there is often no rain at all, and a shorter and less severe one from December to February. Rainfall varies geographically, with the west and northwest of the country receiving more precipitation annually than the east and southeast. Global warming has caused a change in the pattern of the rainy seasons. According to a report by the Strategic Foresight Group, change in climate has reduced the number of rainy days experienced during a year, but has also caused an increase in frequency of torrential rains. Both changes have caused difficulty for farmers, decreasing their productivity. Strategic Foresight also characterise Rwanda as a fast warming country, with an increase in average temperature of between 0.7°C to 0.9°C over fifty years.|$|E
5|$|Rwandans {{have been}} {{competing}} at the Olympic Games since 1984, and the Paralympic Games since 2004.

5|$|The October 1990 {{invasion}} started {{well for}} the RPF, but suffered a reversal when Fred Rwigyema was killed in action on the second day. The FAR, assisted by troops sent from France, gained the upper hand and the RPF were largely defeated {{by the end of}} October. Paul Kagame took command of the demoralised RPF troops, withdrawing to the Virunga mountains for several months before restarting the war. The RPF began a classic hit-and-run style guerrilla war, which continued until. mid-1992 with neither side able to gain the upper hand. The war led to a resurgence of violence against Tutsi in Rwanda, as well as the token introduction of multi-party politics. A series of escalating protests in mid-1992 forced Habyarimana to begin peace negotiations. This was a complex process involving his government, the RPF, the official opposition, and a group of Hutu hardliners. These hardliners opposed the peace process and disrupted the negotiations. They then initiated a massive wave of killings in early 1993, prompting Paul Kagame to launch a fresh offensive and bring the RPF to the verge of taking the capital, <b>Kigali.</b> Kagame decided not to storm the capital, however, and the two sides returned to the negotiating table with the RPF enjoying a strengthened hand.|$|E
5|$|After 1945, a Hutu counter-elite developed, {{leading to}} a {{deterioration}} in relations between the groups. The Tutsi leadership agitated for speedy independence to cement their hold on power, while the Hutu elite called for the transfer of power from Tutsi to Hutu, a stance increasingly supported by {{the church and the}} colonial government. In November 1959, the Hutu began a series of riots and arson attacks on Tutsi homes, following false rumours of the death of a Hutu sub-chief by Tutsi activists. Violence quickly spread across the whole country, beginning the Rwandan Revolution. The king and Tutsi politicians attempted a fightback, seeking to seize power and ostracise the Hutu and Belgians. This plan was thwarted by Belgian colonel Guy Logiest, who was brought in by the colonial governor. Logiest re-established law and order, and began a programme of overt promotion and protection of the Hutu elite, replacing many Tutsi chiefs with Hutu, and forcing King Kigeli V into exile. Logiest and Hutu leader Grégoire Kayibanda declared the country an autonomous republic in 1961, and it became independent in 1962. More than 336,000 Tutsi left Rwanda to escape the Hutu purges, settling primarily in the four neighbouring countries of Burundi, Uganda, Tanzania and Zaire. The Tutsi exiles were regarded as refugees in their host countries, and sought a quick return to Rwanda. They formed armed groups and launched attacks on Rwanda, the largest of which advanced close to <b>Kigali</b> in 1963. These groups were known as the inyenzi (cockroaches). Historians do not know the origin of this term – it is possible the rebels coined it themselves, the name reflecting the fact that they generally attacked at night. The inyenzi label resurfaced in the 1990s, as a highly derogatory term used by Hutu hardliners to refer to all Tutsi, dehumanising them. The inyenzi attacks of the 1960s were poorly equipped and organised and the government defeated them, following up with the slaughter of an estimated 10,000 Tutsi within Rwanda.|$|E
