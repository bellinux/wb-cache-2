5000|$|V2O5 gels are {{prepared}} using the ion-exchange method. Vanadium (V) polymerizes aniline. Before synthesis of a hybrid battery, potentiometric titration of V2O5 gel with (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2*6H2O is carried out; this determines {{the amount of}} V(V) present in the gel. Aniline solution is slowly added onto the V2O5*nH2O gel. The following procedure is demonstrated in Figure 3. [...] V2O5 is used because of its high specific capacity, high thermal stability, and high structural flexibility with lithium. Up to three moles of lithium ions can be added into the V2O5 lattice to create different structures. The structures created give the hybrid a long battery life. However, the intercalation capacity depends on the moderate electrical conductivity and low diffusion coefficient of the lithium ions in the vanadium oxide matrix. Polyaniline is easily produced to have controlled structural and electronic properties. Polyaniline eliminates the coordinated water of the V2O5 xerogel, so more lithium ions can {{be integrated into the}} structure. The organic part of the PAni/V2O5 hybrid degrades with the increase of temperature. V(V) is reduced to V(IV), and aniline is oxidized to polyaniline. Re-oxidizing V(IV) to a higher oxidation state of V(V) increases initial cell voltage and specific capacity. Since polyaniline is an <b>electrochemically</b> <b>active</b> <b>component,</b> it improves the specific charge of the hybrid material. Combining polyaniline with V2O5 yields a larger specific charge difference. Thus, a greater total capacity contribution than V2O5 alone. Furthermore, the hybrid has a higher specific capacity than that of the V2O5 xerogel. Electrical conductivity is as high as 0.09 S/cm for 15 days.|$|E

40|$|The {{determination}} of trace p-nitrophenol (PNP) concentrations in human urine {{has been successfully}} achieved by high performance liquid chromatography dual electrode detection (LC-DED) in the reduction-reduction mode. Initial cyclic voltammetric studies were undertaken to investigate the electrochemical behavior of PNP at a glassy carbon electrode over a wide pH range; the redox processes giving rise to the signals have been deduced. Further, deductions regarding the behavior in the flow cells were made from hydrodynamic voltammetric data. PNP eluting from the analytical LC column is first reduced to p-hydroxylaminophenol, at the first generator electrochemical cell. This species then undergoes chemical oxidation to give a quinoneimine species which is then detected at the downstream detector electrode using an applied potential of - 0. 1 V. The optimum chromatographic mobile phase consisted of 40 % acetonitrile, 60 % water, containing 25 mM o-phosphoric acid, at a flow rate of 0. 5 mL/min; this was {{used in conjunction with}} a Hypersil C- 18 column. Hydrodynamic voltammetric studies were undertaken to investigate the dual electrode behavior of PNP, and an applied potential of - 2. 0 Vat the generator cell and - 0. 10 V at the detector cell were found to be optimum.

The ratio determines the hydrophobicity and thus the performance. Modifications of the hydrophobicity were applied, in particular with the goal to form a non-uniform wettability to the gas diffusion media, thus introducing in parallel more hydrophilic pathways for water while maintaining more hydrophobic areas. Modifications applied by irradiation with laser, x-ray, and ion-beam were assessed and correlated to the alterations of hydrophobicity and tested for improvements. It was observed, that while a direct improvement in output power could not be achieved with pure hydrophobicity modifications, the current density distribution in a running fuel cell was more homogeneous. Both the areas of extremely high and low current densities were reduced. Due to the close correlation of these extreme conditions and the degradation of PEFCs, it can be expected, that the durability is increased with the applied non-uniform surface modifications.

Lanthanum chromite (perovskite) and aliovalent doped zirconia (fluorite) based composites have been considered as promising material of choice for use as <b>electrochemically</b> <b>active</b> <b>components</b> in oxygen transport membrane. Inter–cationic diffusion and formation of secondary compounds due to the interaction between the perovskite and fluorite, however, modifies the thermo-physical and electrochemical properties of such systems leading to the performance and structural degradation.

In this study, phase transformation, stability and thermal-electrical properties of un-doped lanthanum chromite (LaCrO 3) have been evaluated. Furthermore, the role of various A (Sr) and B-site (Mn, Fe, Ni and Ti) dopants on the crystal structure, densification, electrical conductivity, thermal expansion, electrochemical performance and thermochemical stability of lanthanum chromite is investigated to enlighten ‘composition-structure-property-stability’ correlations and achieve OTM materials requirement. The effect of oxygen partial pressure and Cr: M (B-site dopants; e. g. Fe) ratio on the processing (sintering behavior), thermal-electrical properties and stability (surface, bulk and interfacial) of La 1 -xSrxCr 1 -yMyO 3 -δ (with and without fluorite phase) are studied in detail. Perovskite – fluorite interactions in the composite results in the secondary compound formation (e. g. SrZrO 3) during exposure to reducing atmospheres. Mechanisms for the formation of the secondary compounds are established. This study demonstrates the stability of lanthanum chromite based materials increases with increase in Cr:M ratio. In contrast, densification and performance decreases with the increase in the ratio. Optimization of the required properties is accomplished by introducing variation in the doping type and level of A-site (alkaline earth metals; Sr) and B-site (transition metals; Mn, Fe, Ni and Ti) dopants. In summary, this thesis presents the research work performed on the fundamental understanding and development of the perovskite/fluorite based materials for oxygen transport membrane system.

40|$|Xiao, John Q. The {{microwave}} {{wireless power}} transfer system can be divided into five elements, including energy emission component, energy harvesting module, energy storage component, power conditioning component and functioning module. This dissertation is dedicated to developing a new class of microwave {{wireless power transfer}} system by investigating the first three elements. To increase the energy harvesting efficiency, the metamaterial absorber based energy harvesting device was introduced. The investigation to this new device started with a transmission line model to characterize the metamaterial absorber and followed by demonstration in both simulation and experiment for the energy harvesting based on metamaterial absorber with varies of substrate materials. Both simulation and experimental results are qualitatively consistent with the transmission line model prediction that the signal transfer ratio reduces when the dielectric loss of the substrate increases. The highest experientially demonstrate signal transfer ratio reaches 96 % when using Rogers 5880 LZ as the substrate material. In order to increase the transmission efficiency between the emission component and energy harvesting module, it is desired to identify the incident wave direction from the energy harvesting perspective and enhance the antenna gain from both emission and energy harvesting perspectives. To identify the incident wave direction, we have adapted the basic design of metamaterial absorber to fabricate a microwave subwavelength imaging device. Similar to an optical camera, such device is able to track the incident wave direction when combining with a microwave lens. The performance test of the imaging device based on metamaterial absorber has shown that it can not only identify the position of the focused beam with an accuracy of 1 % wavelength in the far field imaging test, but also is capable of carrying out near field imaging by capturing the electromagnetic power distribution with ignorable distortion to the original power distribution. The gain enhancement was proposed by placing a artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) underneath the radiation antenna. AMC is able to reflect the microwave with a phase shift of between - 90 and 90 degree in a frequency band, call in-phase reflection band. We have built a transmission line model for AMC. Derivation based on this transmission line model reveals that the in-phase reflection bandwidth has a theoretical limit {{as a function of the}} thickness and permeability of AMC substrate. The method of making the in-phase reflection bandwidth of an AMC sample approaching its theoretical limit has been proposed. Experimentally, a ratio to the theoretical limit of 98. 5 % has been achieved, which is the highest compared to a number of reported values in AMC simulation and experiment results. By comparing out proposed method to two previously reported methods, we found that our proposed method gives more restricted value. Finally, work has been carried out to develop a new class of energy storage component for the microwave wireless transfer system. A Fe-Ni based electrochemical negative electrodes has been experimentally demonstrated by sintering chemically prepared Fe–Ni nanoparticles into a nanoporous pellet with thickness of 65 μm and mass loading density of 20 mg/cm- 2. This electrode is consisted of nanoscale mixture of an Fe-rich body-centered cubic Fe(Ni) phase and a Ni-rich face-centered cubic Fe–Ni phase. The high conductive and structure stability is provided by the Ni-rich phase and the <b>electrochemically</b> <b>active</b> <b>component</b> of the electrodes is produced by the selective conversion of the Fe-rich phase to hydroxides. The experimental measurement shows the compositionally optimized electrodes exhibit a specific capacitance in excess of 350 F/g by normalizing to the whole electrode mass and retain more than 85 % of their maximum specific capacitance after 2000 charging/discharging cycles. This desirable combination of physical and electrochemical properties indicates that such electrodes may be useful as the negative electrode in high performance asymmetric supercapacitors.

Cyclic voltammetry indicated surface concentration of <b>electrochemically</b> <b>active</b> cytP 450 around 0. 6 nmol/cm 2, which corresponded to 5 % of the total amount of protein that was consumed by the immobilisation process. Adapting the procedure to a graphite felt electrode with the view of scaling up porous electrodes for large scale synthesis increased the concentration to 0. 9 nmol/cm 2. Cast polyion films may represent a simple technique to immobilize high amount of <b>electrochemically</b> <b>active</b> protein, keeping the advantage of the electrostatic interactions of the regular layer-by-layer method...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{distance}} between a β-cyclodextrin (βCD) host core and a conductive substrate on the electron-transfer rate of complexed guests {{as well as of}} free-diffusing <b>electrochemically</b> <b>active</b> probes has been studied. First we have evaluated a set of short-tethered βCD adsorbates bearing different anchoring groups {{in order to get a}} reliable platform for the study of short-distance electron transfer. An <b>electrochemically</b> <b>active</b> trivalent guest was immobilized on these host monolayers in a selective and reversible manner, providing information about the packing density. Iodine- and nitrile-functionalized βCD monolayers gave coverages close to maximum packing. Electron transfer in the presence of Fe(CN) 6 3 -/ 4 - studied by impedance spectroscopy revealed that the electron transfer of the diffusing probe was 3 orders of magnitude faster than when the βCD cores were separated from the surface by undecyl chains. When an <b>electrochemically</b> <b>active</b> guest was immobilized on the surface, electron-transfer rate measurements by cyclic voltammetry and capacitance spectroscopy showed differences of up to a factor of 8 for different βCD monolayers. These results suggest that increasing the distance between the βCD core and the underlying conductive substrate leads to a diminishing of the electron-transfer rate...|$|R

Three-dimensional thin-films use the third dimension {{to increase the}} <b>electrochemically</b> <b>active</b> area.

40|$|A {{system for}} {{identification}} and quantification of <b>electrochemically</b> <b>active</b> compounds in a flow stream involves stepping the electrode potential in a detector rapidly through {{the range of}} interest with a square wave superimposed on a staircase signal and recording the current response as functions of step number and sweep number, i. e., as functions of voltage and time. From the recorded data, a three-dimensional graph (potential, time and current) is structured and from which identification and quantification of the <b>electrochemically</b> <b>active</b> compounds is effected with minimum expenditure of time. The system includes a potentiostat controlled by a computer with, however, independent logic control contained in the potentiostat. Provision is also made to compensate automatically for variations in resistance between the cell electrodes. Georgia Tech. Research Institut...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{systematic}} study of <b>electrochemically</b> <b>active</b> surface states on MOCVD-grown n-type GaN in aqueous electrolytes using cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy {{over a wide}} range of potentials and frequencies. In order to alter the surface states, the GaN samples are either etched or oxidized, and the influence of the surface treatment on the defect-mediated charge transfer to the electrolyte is investigated. Etching in HCl removes substoichiometric GaO, and leads to a pronounced density of <b>electrochemically</b> <b>active</b> surface states. Oxidation effectively removes these surface states.

40|$|<b>Electrochemically</b> <b>active</b> Polypyrrole (PPy) nano-fiber array {{device was}} {{fabricated}} via electrochemical deposition method using aluminum anodic oxide (AAO) membrane as template. After alkaline treatment <b>electrochemically</b> <b>active</b> PPy nano-fiber lost electrochemical activity, and became electrochemically inactive PPy. The electronic properties of PPy nano-fiber array devices were measured {{by means of}} a simple method. It was found that for an indium-tin oxide/electrochemically inactive PPy nano-fiber device, the conductivity of nano-fiber increased with the increase of voltage applied on the two terminals of nano-fiber. The electrochemical inactive PPy nano-fiber might be used as a nano-fiber switching diode. Both Au/electrochemically active PPy and Au/electrochemically inactive PPy nano-fiber devices demonstrate rectifying behavior, and might have been used for further application as nano-rectifiers.
