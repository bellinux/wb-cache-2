40|$|<b>Excessive</b> <b>speeding</b> {{behavior}} of the drivers {{is one of the}} challenges in the area of transportation around the world. <b>Excessive</b> <b>speeding</b> is defined as driving faster than the posted speed limit or driving too fast for the prevailing traffic and environment conditions. This paper provides a modeling framework that integrates the dynamic interaction between causal factors responsible for motivating drivers to adopt <b>excessive</b> <b>speeding</b> behavior. This modeling framework is developed based on information gathered through extensive literature review on speed choice {{behavior of}} the drivers, interviews of officials from police department, and interviews of a group of drivers. The modeling framework has been translated into a formal simulation model. The development of simulation model includes heuristic relationships that need refinements based on empirical evidence. It is expected that end product of this research would be a fully integrated decision-support tool that would help in understanding the resistance to achieving a sustainable {{reduction in the number of}} <b>excessive</b> <b>speeding</b> drivers...|$|R

5|$|On 14 March 1980, {{an empty}} stock train {{comprising}} five Hastings Unit vehicles derailed at Appledore due to <b>excessive</b> <b>speed</b> through {{a set of}} points. The driver was killed. A motor coach was consequently withdrawn from service due to extensive damage.|$|E
5|$|Southcote {{is within}} Thames Valley Police's catchment, and is grouped as a {{neighbourhood}} with Norcot. Residents identified nuisance and illegal parking and <b>excessive</b> <b>speed</b> as {{of concern in}} the area, {{as well as the}} antisocial use of mini motos, quad bikes and motorcycles on the Kennet towpath. Measures to alleviate nuisance parking were introduced in early 2015 with a ban on parking on the road verge. In June 2015, signs were installed on the lane to Southcote Mill to warn motorcycle users of their prohibition on that right of way.|$|E
5|$|Imo {{was granted}} {{clearance}} to leave Bedford Basin by {{signals from the}} guard ship HMCS Acadia at approximately 7:30 {{on the morning of}} 6 December, with Pilot William Hayes on board. The ship entered the Narrows well above the harbour's speed limit in an attempt {{to make up for the}} delay experienced in loading her cargo. Imo met American tramp steamer SS Clara being piloted up the wrong (western) side of the harbour. The pilots agreed to pass starboard-to-starboard. Soon afterwards though, Imo was forced to head even further towards the Dartmouth shore after passing the tugboat Stella Maris, which was travelling up the harbour to Bedford Basin near mid-channel. Horatio Brannen, the captain of Stella Maris, saw Imo approaching at <b>excessive</b> <b>speed</b> and ordered his ship closer to the western shore to avoid an accident.|$|E

50|$|In {{places where}} 20 mph speeds are desired but where <b>excessive</b> <b>speeds</b> (85th {{percentile}} speed of 24 mph or above) occur, 20 mph zones are recommended. These {{have to use}} traffic calming measures to reduce speeds to below 20 mph.|$|R
50|$|Two or {{more serious}} traffic violations, {{including}} <b>excessive</b> <b>speeding,</b> reckless driving, improper or erratic lane changes, following the vehicle ahead too closely, and traffic offenses {{in connection with}} fatal traffic accidents, within a three-year period: a 90-day to five-year suspension.|$|R
5|$|The railway opened {{short of}} rolling stock as {{only half of}} the twelve {{locomotives}} and twenty-four of forty passenger carriages ordered had arrived. The carriage builders, Brown, Marshall & Co of Birmingham, stated that based on their experience they had expected the line to open at least two months late. The third day after opening to passengers, on 23 September, there was a collision between two trains at Kittybrewster that resulted in the death of a passenger and several serious injuries. The inquiry found that the driver, attempting to make up time after a late start, had over-run previous stations and been approaching the terminus with <b>excessive</b> <b>speed.</b> The driver attempted to select reverse gear to slow the train but had failed {{to hold on to the}} lever, which slipped into forward, propelling the train into carriages waiting at the platform. The report also criticised the station staff, who should not have allowed the carriages to be waiting at the station. The layout at Kittybrewster was altered after the accident.|$|E
5|$|On the {{following}} lap, Bowyer fell to third. At {{the end of}} lap 45, Edwards remained the leader, ahead Kurt Busch and Burton. By the 48th lap, Gordon had moved up 15 positions {{since the beginning of}} the race. On the 50th lap, the third caution was given after Bayne collided with the wall, sustaining major damage. Most drivers made pit stops during the caution. At the lap 55 restart, Kurt Busch was the leader, while Edwards fell to 15th. On lap 56, Matt Kenseth up moved to second, as Tony Stewart up moved to the third position. On {{the following}} lap, Marcos Ambrose moved up to the fifth position. On the 67th lap, the caution was given because of an accident involving 13 drivers. Afterward, the red flag was waved to help the officials to continue removing debris. At the lap 72 restart, Hamlin was the leader, ahead of Newman, and Menard. Dale Earnhardt, Jr. had to restart last, after getting a penalty for <b>excessive</b> <b>speed</b> on pit row. Three laps later, Newman overtook the lead after passing Hamlin, as Gordon moved up to second. On the 77th lap, Gordon passed Newman to become the leader, as his team-mate Johnson passed Kyle Busch to move the 11th position. On the following lap, Hamlin fell to third. On the next lap, Stewart passed Hamlin to claim third.|$|E

50|$|Dodson has {{a long-standing}} {{reputation}} as a notorious speed trap, {{with more than half}} of its revenue generated by traffic citations with a total of $717 in citation revenue per resident, the fourth highest in the state. Dodson was cited in a state audit in 2007 for issuing <b>excessive</b> <b>speeding</b> violations.|$|R
50|$|Initially trains {{travelled}} at 17 mph, due {{the limitations}} of the track. Drivers could, and did, travel more quickly, but they would be reprimanded: it was found that <b>excessive</b> <b>speeds</b> could force apart the light rails, which were set onto individual stone blocks without cross-ties. In 1837 work started to replace the original fish-belly rail with parallel rail of , on sleepers.|$|R
50|$|While {{on route}} to Beirut he shared a taxi {{with a local}} family. One of the sons {{recognized}} an unusual detour being taken by the taxi driver.

50|$|By the 2000s (decade), the 'peoplised' {{transport}} services accounted {{for less than}} a quarter of the daily load of bus passengers. Scarcely a day passed without a letter in the press complaining about overloading, <b>excessive</b> <b>speeds,</b> dangerous driving, rudeness and overcharging on the private buses. The cluster companies did not suffer as much bad publicity, as they endeavoured to observe regulatory requirements and offered a nationwide, if thinly spread service.|$|R

25|$|On February 26, 2012, Via Rail train 92 {{en route}} from Niagara Falls to Toronto, derailed in Burlington, Ontario, killing all three {{railroad}} engineers and injuring 46 (3 seriously). The cause of the derailment is attributed to the <b>excessive</b> <b>speed</b> of the train travelling through a switch from track 2 to track 3.|$|E
25|$|A train crash with {{fatalities}} occurred {{shortly after}} 11:30 p.m. on April 19, 1940, when a first-class westbound Lake Shore Limited {{operated by the}} New York Central Railroad, derailed near Little Falls, New York, United States. The accident was later found to have occurred due to <b>excessive</b> <b>speed</b> on the Gulf Curve, the sharpest on the Central's lines. It killed 31; an additional 51 were injured.|$|E
25|$|Recklessness {{among the}} boatmen was common. Many {{accidents}} {{were due to}} <b>excessive</b> <b>speed.</b> Aqueduct #3 (Catoctin) had a sharp bend at the upstream end, had been {{the site of a}} number of collisions from boatmen going too fast. In July 1855, a freight boat collided with a packet boat which sank. One of the most frequent problems was careless boatmen in their rush to lock through, hitting lock gates.|$|E
