25|$|Note that Promissory Estoppel {{should not}} be {{confused}} with Estoppel for Non-disclosure of Knowledge, colloquially known as 'Nolissory Estoppel'. This arises when a party to a contract indicates that they have some knowledge about the value or the potential success/failure of a contract to the other party, but refuses to share this knowledge or 'nol'. The party with the 'nol' is <b>estopped</b> from their non-disclosure, and is forced to impart it equitably.|$|E
25|$|In this case, the claimants let a {{block of}} flats to the {{defendants}} at an annual rent of £2500. However, they agreed to accept a reduction in rent to £1250, because the defendants were unable to find enough tenants due to the evacuation of London during World War II. This promise to accept a lesser rent was unsupported by consideration. At {{the end of the}} war the flats became fully let, and the claimants demanded the return to payment of full rent. Denning J held that they were entitled to this from the last two quarters of 1945. Denning mentioned in an obiter dictum that had the plaintiffs tried to be reimbursed for the full amount they would have been <b>estopped</b> from doing so even though no consideration was present. This is because the plaintiff represented that he would accept half the rent and the defendant acted upon this.|$|E
25|$|The {{defendants}} {{also argued}} that Steinberg was <b>estopped</b> from defending his copyright {{on the grounds that}} he had taken no action over a period of eight years to stop others from counterfeiting his posters and adapting his idea to other locations, and had not acted in response to newspaper ads promoting the movie. The court rejected this argument, holding that the defendants had not proved any of the elements of estoppel: (1) a representation in fact; (2) reasonable reliance thereon; and (3) injury or damage resulting from denial by the party making the representation. While the defendants argued that Steinberg had made a representation of his acquiescence to their use of his image in the movie poster by not complaining about the ads in the newspaper, the judge rejected this line of reasoning and noted that the defendants had continued to use the infringing advertisements even after becoming aware of Steinberg's objections. Further, there was no existing relationship between the parties that could give rise to estoppel.|$|E
30|$|Various {{versions}} of TCP such as AIMP, Cubic, Bic, Vegas, and CTCP are studied {{to analyze the}} congestion window and average throughput values in [88]. The <b>ESTOP</b> algorithm is used for decreasing the congestion window value. <b>ESTOP</b> switches off links in increasing order of an associated centrality level of the network by {{counting the number of}} shortest paths. In the algorithm, the switch off count is associated with a threshold value which preserves the network connectivity. After switch off operation, the link state update of OSPF is used for changing the topology. The <b>ESTOP</b> is simulated in the Abilene network. In simulations, a TCP flow is established between two distant nodes in the network. For the worst case scenario, the outermost two nodes are selected as TCP flow endpoints, and in these nodes, TCP flow is also affected in terms of available capacity after the links switch off. It is observed that, for the considered TCP versions, it is possible to gain energy in the network without a drastic compromise of the TCP performance. The switching off links obtained by using <b>ESTOP</b> produce higher energy savings.|$|R

50|$|The verb is <b>estop,</b> {{which comes}} from Middle English estoppen, itself {{borrowed}} from Old French estop(p)er, estouper, presumably from Vulgar Latin *stuppāre 'to stop up with tow, caulk', from Latin stuppa, 'broken flax', from Ancient Greek stuppe, 'broken flax' The noun form estoppel {{is based on the}} Old French estoupail 'stopper, bung', a derivative of estouper.|$|R
40|$|Many {{scientific}} works propose {{methods of}} {{reducing the amount of}} energy consumed by the Internet. Although the structure of the Internet was not developed with specific attention to energy consumption, there are various components on which it is possible to act. In our work, we analyze the possibility of affecting the topology of the network. We propose a heuristic called Energy Saving based on TOPology control (<b>ESTOP),</b> which identifies poorly used router line cards by leveraging certain topological properties of the graph modeling an Internet Service Provider (ISP). By acting on these line cards - for example, by putting them into sleep mode - we prune the Internet topology and achieve significant energy savings while preserving the primary topological characteristics of the pruned network. Although <b>ESTOP</b> is traffic-unaware, we assess its behavior under real traffic loads, demonstrating that its performance is comparable to the more complex traffic-aware solutions proposed in the literature. © 2012 Elsevier B.

2500|$|He {{then found}} {{that that was}} exactly what the Court of Appeal, no less, had done. Once the {{proprietary}} right is established, then and only then will the court consider the conduct of the party seeking to deny the right and if that conduct is wanting, will <b>estop</b> him from denying the right. [...] The court should not begin with an examination of a party's behaviour.|$|R
2500|$|However, {{consideration}} is a doctrine deriving {{from the common}} law, and can be suspended under the principles of equity. Historically, England had two separate court systems, and the Courts of Chancery which derived their ultimate authority from the King via the Lord Chancellor, took precedence over the common law courts. So does its body of equitable principles since the systems were merged in 1875. The doctrine of promissory estoppel holds that when one person gives an assurance to another, the other relies on it {{and it would be}} inequitable to go back on the assurance, that person will be <b>estopped</b> from doing so: an analogue of the maxim that nobody should profit from their own wrong (nemo auditur propriam turpitudinem allegans). So in Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co the House of Lords held that a tenant could not be ejected by the landlord for failing to keep up with his contractual repair duties because starting negotiations to sell the property gave the tacit assurance that the repair duties were suspended. And in Central London Properties Ltd v High Trees House Ltd Denning J held that a landlord would be <b>estopped</b> from claiming normal rent during the years of World War II because he had given an assurance that half rent could be paid till the war was done. The Court of Appeal went even further in a recent debt repayment case, Collier v P J Wright (Holdings) Ltd. Arden LJ argued that a partner who had been assured he was only liable to repay one third of the partnership's debts, rather than be jointly and severally liable for the whole, had relied on the assurance by making repayments, and it was inequitable for the finance company to later demand full repayment of the debt. Hence, promissory estoppel could circumvent the common law rule of Foakes. Promissory estoppel, however, has been thought to be incapable of raising an independent cause of action, so that one may only plead another party is <b>estopped</b> from enforcing their strict legal rights as a [...] "shield", but cannot bring a cause of action out of estoppel as a [...] "sword". In Australia, this rule was relaxed in Walton Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher, where Mr Maher was encouraged to believe he would have a contract to sell his land, and began knocking down his existing building before Walton Stores finally told him they did not wish to complete. Mr Maher got generous damages covering his loss (i.e. reliance damages, but seemingly damages for loss of expectations as if there were a contract). Yet, where an assurance concerns rights over property, a variant [...] "proprietary estoppel" [...] does allow a claimant to plead estoppel as a cause of action. So in Crabb v Arun District Council, Mr Crabbe was assured he would have the right to an access point to his land by Arun District Council, and relying on that he sold off half the property where the only existing access point was. The council was <b>estopped</b> from not doing what they said they would. Given the complex route of legal reasoning to reach simple solutions, it is unsurprising that a number of commentators, as well as the Principles of European Contract Law have called for simple abandonment of the doctrine of consideration, leaving the basic requirements of agreement and an intention to create legal relations. Such a move would also dispense with the need for the common law doctrine of privity.|$|E
2500|$|Promissory {{estoppel}} requires (1) an unequivocal promise by {{words or}} conduct, (2) {{a change in}} position of the promisee {{as a result of}} the promise (not necessarily to their detriment), (3) inequity if the promisor were to go back on the promise. Estoppel is [...] "a shield not a sword" [...] – it cannot be used as the basis of an action on its own. It also does not extinguish rights. In High Trees the plaintiff company was able to restore payment of full rent (although <b>estopped</b> back rent was lost) from early 1945, but would have been able to restore full rent at any time after the initial promise provided a suitable period of notice had been given.|$|E
2500|$|Deane's successors in title, {{who were}} {{currently}} {{in possession of}} the land, contended that they and those from whom they claimed the land had been in [...] "open, continuous adverse possession" [...] of the disputed land for {{more than thirty years}} {{prior to the start of}} the current action, and had paid taxes due on the land; the plaintiffs and those from whom they claimed had not been in possession for any period of time exceeding thirty years or paid taxes. They further contended that equitable title came from the United States starting in 1803, that the United States had made no attempt to claim the land itself, and that the previous holding in the 1836 equity suit by John Deane <b>estopped</b> the plaintiffs from now trying to claim the land.|$|E
5000|$|The case {{presents}} no {{elements of}} equitable title or of breach of trust. The only possible reason for resort {{to a court}} of equity {{in a case like}} this is that the remedy which the law gives is inadequate.

2500|$|Estoppel could {{arise in}} a {{situation}} where a creditor informs a debtor that a debt is forgiven, but then later insists upon repayment. In a case such as this, the creditor may be <b>estopped</b> from relying on their legal right to repayment, as the creditor has represented that he no longer treats the debt as extant. A landlord may tell his tenant that he is not required to pay rent {{for a period of time}} ("you don't need to pay rent until the war is over"). [...] After the war is over, the landlord would be [...] "estopped" [...] from claiming rents during the war period. Estoppel is often important in insurance law, where some actions by the insurer or the agent estop the insurer from denying a claim.|$|E
2500|$|If a {{claimant}} through conduct has subsequently affirmed {{a contract}} despite some prior misrepresentation, {{she will be}} <b>estopped</b> from changing her mind. For instance, in the slightly harsh case of Long v Lloyd Mr Long bought from Mr Lloyd a lorry advertised as being in ‘exceptional condition,’ said to do 40mph and 11 miles to the gallon. When it broke down after two days and was doing 5 miles to the gallon, Mr Long complained. Mr Lloyd said he would repair it for half {{the price of a}} reconstructed dynamo. Because Mr Long accepted this, when it broke down again, Pearce LJ held the contract had been affirmed. It was too late to escape for misrepresentation. A more lenient approach may now exist. As Slade LJ pointed out in Peyman v Lanjani, actual knowledge of the right to choose to affirm a contract or rescind is essential before one can be said to have [...] "affirmed" [...] a contract.|$|E
2500|$|First, if a Directive's {{deadline}} for implementation is not met, the member state cannot enforce conflicting laws, and a citizen may {{rely on the}} Directive in such an action (so called [...] "vertical" [...] direct effect). So, in Pubblico Ministero v Ratti because the Italian government had failed to implement a Directive 73/173/EEC on packaging and labelling solvents by the deadline, it was <b>estopped</b> from enforcing a conflicting national law from 1963 against Mr Ratti's solvent and varnish business. A member state could [...] "not rely, as against individuals, on its own failure to perform the obligations which the Directive entails". Second, a citizen or company can also invoke a Directive as a defence in a dispute with another citizen or company (not just a public authority) which is attempting to enforce a national law that conflicts with a Directive. So, in CIA Security v Signalson and Securitel the Court of Justice held that a business called CIA Security could defend itself from allegations by competitors {{that it had not}} complied with a Belgian decree from 1991 about alarm systems, on the basis that it had not been notified to the Commission as a Directive required. Third, if a Directive gives expression to a [...] "general principle" [...] of EU law, it can be invoked between private non-state parties before its {{deadline for}} implementation. This follows from Kücükdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG where the German Civil Code §622 stated that the years people worked under the age of 25 would not count towards the increasing statutory notice before dismissal. Ms Kücükdeveci worked for 10 years, from age 18 to 28, for Swedex GmbH & Co KG before her dismissal. She claimed that the law not counting her years under age 25 was unlawful age discrimination under the Employment Equality Framework Directive. The Court of Justice held that the Directive could be relied on by her because equality was also a general principle of EU law. Fourth, if the defendant is an emanation of the state, even if not central government, it can still be bound by Directives. In Foster v British Gas plc the Court of Justice held that Mrs Foster was entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer, British Gas plc, which made women retire at age 60 and men at 65, if (1) pursuant to a state measure, (2) it provided a public service, and (3) had special powers. This could also be true if the enterprise is privatised, as it was held with a water company that was responsible for basic water provision.|$|E

50|$|However, {{estoppel}} has no {{application to}} representations made regarding the fundamental rights conferred by the Constitution of India, {{the source of}} all laws, which exists not only to benefit individuals but to secure collective rights.

40|$|Although {{curbside}} {{bus stops}} facilitate the boarding and alighting of buses, they create temporary bottlenecks by reducing vehicular speed and roadway capacity. Further, they cause substantial delays to other vehicles and {{force them to}} change lanes. This problem is more severe in developing countries like India, where bus drivers often face difficulties in stopping buses closer to their designated bus stops. The reasons for improper stopping include passengers waiting for the bus on the roadway instead of using the bus stop platform, arrival of multiple buses at the same time, standing vehicles on the curb lane (especially auto-rickshaws), etc. In this study, the effect of untidy stopping of buses on forced lane changes and traffic stream speed is evaluated by analysing traffic video data on two urban arterial sections in New Delhi. Both the sections have bus stopping areas marked and no on-street parking is allowed on the curb lane. A parameter called effective stopped position of buses (<b>Estop)</b> is introduced in this study, which can be determined from the lateral position and dwell time of the buses. Forced lane changes and traffic stream speed {{are found to be}} linearly related to the sum of dwell times of all buses at different <b>Estop</b> values in a count period of 5 minutes. It is further observed that forced lane changes increase and traffic stream speed decreases quite drastically when improper stopping of buses is severe...|$|R
