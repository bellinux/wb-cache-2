[...] "In sports you make movement and you are maybe sculpting or painting in the space with your body," [...] he told Clara Iaccarino of the Sydney Morning Herald. [...] "In art you use instruments. Art is just energy, {{you have to do}} it; <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out." [...] He works in a disused railway shed in the north of Paris, where he forms and twists his found steel, manipulating the shapes created by the resulting positive and negative spaces. He cuts the beams strategically to form complex compositions in which the hardness of the steel forms a powerful juxtaposition to the soft curves. Rives' sculptures were called by the French La Dépêche du Midi [...] "a marvelous mixture of suffering, grace and beauty." ...|$|E

[...] "Public opinion," [...] said an anonymous postcard sent to a friend of mine, [...] "will compel you to learn Irish," [...] and it certainly did compel many persons of settled habits to change tailor and cloth.

Furthermore, in the next episode Bunk and Lester tell McNulty that they are collateral damage from his revenge.

[...] Niall was also inadvertently {{responsible for the death of}} one of Hollyoaks most iconic characters, Max Cunningham.

She tries to persuade Lynn into betraying her sister, but Lynn refuses, since she's realised Kelly is {{the most important person in}} her life. Still, she promises to hand over the moonstone if Agatha lets everyone go, which Agatha agrees to. Lynn places the moonstone on the floor and then Aunt Agatha breaks her end of the promise, threatening to turn everybody into animals forever. Mr. N flies down the staircase and snatches the moonstone away in his beak, while Kelly escapes from George's watch and the girls flee upstairs to free Sophia together. They ask Sophia what the incantation is, but Sophia reveals that <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from their hearts.|$|E
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} from 11 to 13 February 2013 at Grand Sport studio in Oslo. Two {{of the six}} tracks are jazz standards, three were written by the band and one was composed by Flaten. John Coltrane's [...] "India" [...] contains white noise bass, repeated baritone saxophone patterns and aggressive drumming around them, then breaks into low baritone improvisations. On [...] "Reboot", [...] "bass and sax trade riffs; they establish interlocking sound patterns as Nilssen-Love's drums forcefully prod, until all hell breaks loose, as Eastern European wedding music ripples against metallic vamps and driving free improvisation." [...] "Heaven", a Duke Ellington composition, was arranged by Gustafsson. It begins quietly and gradually {{moves away from the}} melody and then the harmony of the theme. Flaten's [...] "Red River" [...] is a threatening, noise rock piece. [...] "Boot!" [...] develops gradually, with bass and drums providing support for Gustafsson's playing. [...] "Epillog" [...] starts with repeated bass and saxophone tones that become stretched. [...] "When Nilssen-Love enters with rumbling, stampeding tom-toms, things are already unhinged, the music pushes the margin and cuts free of restraint, entering into its own sonic language, dialoguing poetically with color, tone, space, and texture. It moves so far out, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back; and so it does via the drummer's accelerated, circular funky breaks; they prod the band to climb down, eventually finding a grooving rock & roll center to close".|$|E

30|$|Risk taken, as an {{important}} part of individual characteristics, was mentioned by just one owner-manager (EB) during interviews.

40|$|Almost every European {{country that}} gained {{independence}} after the First World War had {{one thing in}} common: with only one exception, they all tried to stimulate {{the growth of a}} national literature by commissioning translations of two key texts â the Bible and the works of Shakespeare.

The one exception to this trend was, of course, Ireland which (leaving aside our troublesome attitudes to God), found itself in a strange relationship with Shakespeare: too familiar to be translated, his work was also too English to be comfortably assimilated into our culture...|$|E
