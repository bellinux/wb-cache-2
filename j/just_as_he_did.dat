5|$|During the May 21, 2001 {{episode of}} Raw Is War, he {{suffered}} a legitimate and career-threatening injury. In the night's main event, he and Austin were defending the WWF Tag Team Championship against Chris Jericho and Chris Benoit. At one point, Jericho had Austin trapped in the Walls of Jericho and Triple H ran in to break it up, but <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> {{he suffered a}} tear in his left quadriceps muscle, causing it to come completely off the bone. Despite his inability to place any weight on his leg, Triple H was able to complete the match. He even allowed Jericho {{to put him in}} the Walls of Jericho, a move that places considerable stress on the quadriceps. The tear required an operation, which was performed by orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews. This injury brought an abrupt end to the McMahon-Helmsley Era, as the rigorous rehabilitation process kept Triple H out of action for over eight months, completely missing The Invasion storyline.|$|E
5|$|Pentecost consults Kaiju experts Newton Geiszler and Herman Gottlieb. Hermann {{claims that}} the Breach will {{stabilize}} and the Kaiju will increase in number, but it will allow the assault to succeed, while Newton suggests drifting with a Kaiju’s brain {{to learn more about}} them. Newton goes ahead with his plan despite Herman's protests and discovers that the Kaiju are actually bioweapons grown by alien colonists, that live on the dimension {{on the other side of}} the breach called the Anteverse, who plan on wiping out humanity. With Pentecost's permission, Newton searches for black market dealer Hannibal Chau who sells body parts of dead Kaiju to obtain a fresh Kaiju brain to drift with. However, he soon figures out that since drifting is a two-way link, the Kaiju hive mind gained access to his knowledge <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> theirs. Soon after, two new Kaijus, Leatherback and Otachi, emerge simultaneously to find Newton.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{survived the}} last 15 {{minutes on the}} first evening to reach stumps on 0/17, with Morris on 10. Barnes and Morris took the score to 73 before the latter was bowled by Jim Laker's off spin for 31. Barnes batted confidently, while the {{hesitant}} Morris shuffled around the crease. At one stage, Morris scored only seven runs in 55 minutes, During this period, Morris unnecessarily played at a ball outside off stump from seamer Alec Bedser and edged it to wicket-keeper Evans, who dropped the catch. He recomposed himself and hit left arm orthodox spinner Jack Young's first ball—a full toss—for runs as Australia passed 50 without loss. Morris fell {{when he tried to}} force a ball from Laker away, but hit it from the middle of his bat into his back pad; the ball rebounded onto the stumps. Australia went on to amass 509, and when England batted again, they lost their third wicket at 150. Joe Hardstaff junior came in, and on the third ball he aimed a cut that went low to second slip, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> in the first innings. However, Morris dropped the catch. Hardstaff exploited his second chance to make 43 before falling at 4/243.|$|E

In the third over of Australia's innings, Adam Gilchrist and Brad Haddin fell in {{successive}} balls to South African pace-bowler Shaun Pollock. Brad Hodge fell in the fourth and Australia were in trouble at 3/21 after 3.4 overs. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> in the warm-up against New Zealand, Andrew Symonds steadied the ship scoring a strong 45 off 26 balls. Despite Symonds' resistance, South Africa continued to steadily take wickets, and only a late flurry of powerful hitting by tailender Mitchell Johnson propelled Australia to a healthy target of 8/179.|$|E

25|$|<b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{two years}} before, Whymper asked Carrel {{to be his}} guide, but Carrel declined; Whymper was also {{unsuccessful}} in hiring other local guides from Breuil. When Whymper discovered Giordano and Carrel's plan, he left Breuil and crossed the Theodul Pass to Zermatt to hire local guides. He encountered Lord Francis Douglas, a Scottish mountaineer, who also wanted to climb the Matterhorn. They arrived later in Zermatt in the Monte Rosa Hotel, where they met two other British climbers — the Reverend Charles Hudson and his young and inexperienced companion, Douglas Robert Hadow — who had hired the French guide Michel Croz {{to try to make}} the first ascent. These two groups decided to join forces and try the ascent of the Hörnli ridge. They hired another two local guides, a father and son, both named Peter Taugwalder.|$|E
25|$|It was Fala, my husband's little dog, {{who never}} really readjusted. Once, in 1945, when General Eisenhower came {{to lay a}} wreath on Franklin's grave, {{the gates of the}} regular {{driveway}} were opened and his automobile approached the house accompanied by the wailing of the sirens of a police escort. When Fala heard the sirens, his legs straightened out, his ears pricked up and I knew that he expected to see his master coming down the drive as he had come so many times. Later, when we were living in the cottage, Fala always lay near the dining-room door where he could watch both entrances <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> when his master was there. Franklin would often decide suddenly to go somewhere and Fala had to watch both entrances in order to be ready to spring up and join the party on short notice. Fala accepted me after my husband's death, but I was just someone to put up with until the master should return.|$|E
25|$|A crowd mills {{about before}} the Cathedral of the Intercession (the Temple of Vasiliy the Blessed) in Red Square. Many are beggars, and policemen {{occasionally}} appear. A {{group of men}} enters, discussing the anathema the deacon had declared on Grishka (Grigoriy) Otrepyev in the mass. They identify Grishka as the Tsarevich. With growing excitement they sing of the advance of his forces to Kromï, of his intent to retake his father's throne, and of the defeat he will deal to the Godunovs. A yuródivïy enters, pursued by urchins. He sings a nonsensical song ("The moon is flying, the kitten is crying"). The urchins greet him and rap on his metal hat. The yuródivïy has a kopek, which the urchins promptly steal. He whines pathetically. Boris and his retinue exit the Cathedral. The boyars distribute alms. In a powerful chorus ("Benefactor father... Give us bread!"), the hungry people beg for bread. As the chorus subsides, the yuródivïy's cries are heard. Boris asks why he cries. The yuródivïy reports the theft of his kopek and asks Boris to order the boys' slaughter, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{in the case of}} the Tsarevich. Shuysky wants the yuródivïy seized, but Boris instead asks for the holy man's prayers. As Boris exits, the yuródivïy declares that the Mother of God will not allow him to pray for Tsar Herod (see Massacre of the Innocents). The yuródivïy then sings his lament ("Flow, flow, bitter tears!") about the fate of Russia.|$|E

500|$|As he {{approached}} the fiftieth anniversary of his accession, the King made plans to abdicate in favor of his son Constantine immediately after the celebration of his golden jubilee in October 1913. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> in Athens, George went about Thessaloniki without any meaningful protection force. While out on an afternoon walk near the White Tower on 18 March 1913, he was shot at close range in the back by Alexandros Schinas, who was [...] "said {{to belong to a}} Socialist organization" [...] and [...] "declared when arrested that he had killed the King because he refused to give him money". George died instantly, the bullet having penetrated his heart. The Greek government denied any political motive for the assassination, saying that Schinas was an alcoholic vagrant. Schinas was tortured in prison and six weeks later fell to his death from a police station window.|$|E
500|$|Early 20th-century biographer André Maurois {{argues that}} [...] "what Byron {{was capable of}} loving in another was {{a certain kind of}} innocence and youthfulness" [...] and that the {{relationship}} was one of Byron's [...] "protective passions". Likewise, G. Wilson Knight, in his 1953 biography of Byron, believes that Byron became protective over Giraud <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> with all of the children he met during his travels. Giraud was special to Byron, and, according to Knight, [...] "it was probably of Nicolo that he was thinking when he wrote that Greece was 'the only place I was ever contented in. In Byron: A Biography, published in 1957, Marchand points out that Byron [...] "wished Hobhouse there to share the nonsensical gaiety" [...] of when Byron and Giraud were together, but changed his mind after remembering that Hobhouse's personality would not be conducive to entertainment. Their time together [...] "was a relaxed pleasure that [...] was to remember more fondly than most of the adventures of his travels".|$|E

500|$|In 1913, the First Balkan War {{ended with}} {{the defeat of the}} Ottoman Empire by a {{coalition}} of Greek, Bulgarian, Serbian and Montenegrin forces. Greece was considerably enlarged at the expense of Turkey, but divisions between the victorious powers in the Balkan League soon became apparent: Athens and Sofia vied for possession of Thessaloniki and its region. To affirm Greek control of the main city of Macedonia, George I moved to the city soon after its liberation. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> in Athens, he went about Thessaloniki without any meaningful protection force, and while out for an afternoon walk near the White Tower on 18 March 1913, he was shot and killed by Alexandros Schinas.

500|$|Don't Look Now ostensibly is an occult thriller, [...] but {{the genre}} {{conventions}} of the Gothic ghost story primarily serve to explore the minds of a grief-stricken couple.

Even the closest, healthiest relationship can come undone through grief." [...] The presence of Christine, the Baxters' deceased daughter, weighs heavily on the mood of the film, as she and the nature of her death are constantly recalled through the film's imagery: there are regular flashbacks to Christine playing in her red coat as well as the sightings of the mysterious childlike figure also wearing a red coat which bears a likeness to her; the constant association of water with death is maintained via a serial-killer sub-plot, which sees victims periodically dragged from the canals; there is also a poignant moment when John fishes a child's doll out of a canal <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> with his daughter's body {{at the beginning of the}} film.|$|E
