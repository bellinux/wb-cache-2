5|$|In a lesser-known tale in the Ganesha Purana (9001400CE) {{the wise}} asura king Virochana is rewarded a magical crown by the sun-god Surya. The crown shields <b>him</b> <b>against</b> all harm. Vishnu as Mohini then enchants Virochana and steals his crown. The demon, thus unprotected, is killed by Vishnu.|$|E

5|$|After the Ottomans {{defeated}} {{the armies of}} the Holy League {{in a series of}} battles in 1596, Transylvanian noblemen sent letters to Andrew, offering him the principality. After realizing that neither the pope nor the Polish king would support <b>him</b> <b>against</b> Sigismund Báthory, Andrew declared that he was ready to make peace with him. He returned to Warmia where he was ordained subdeacon on 4 January 1597. Andrew and Stephen even announced that they would not intervene in Transylvania. Their envoys also started discussions with Sigismund Báthory about the compensation for their expropriated Transylvanian estates.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he owned}} a number of slaves, and his {{marriage}} to Virginia Shelby had {{left him with a}} good many more, Breckinridge had been a supporter of gradual emancipation and colonization of blacks since his early political career. As the sectional crisis worsened, this led him into several high-profile debates, notably with fellow Kentuckian Robert Wickliffe, the uncle of Robert C. Wickliffe. His support of Abraham Lincoln for president in the election of 1860 pitted <b>him</b> <b>against</b> his own nephew, Vice President John C. Breckinridge.|$|E
5|$|Apollo and {{his mentor}} Kristoph Gavin, {{an old friend}} of Phoenix's, are called to {{represent}} <b>him</b> <b>against</b> charges of murdering one of his customers in a rigged game of poker. In the middle of his testimony, Phoenix inadvertently names Kristoph as a witness, {{and with the help of}} a falsified piece of evidence provided by Trucy, exposes him as the real murderer. Impressed by Apollo's performance, he invites him to start his own practice out of Trucy's talent agency.|$|E

5|$|As Upper Canada's administrator, Brock made {{a series}} of changes to prepare for war. He amended the militia act to allow use of all {{available}} volunteers and ordered enhanced training of these raw recruits, despite opposition from the provincial legislature. He continued strengthening and reinforcing defences. Brock also began seeking out First Nations leaders, such as the Shawnee chief Tecumseh, to build alliances with <b>him</b> <b>against</b> the Americans in the event of war. Although the conventional wisdom of the day was that Canada would fall quickly {{in the event of an}} invasion, Brock pursued these strategies to give the colony a fighting chance.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the vague}} {{language}} of the document, {{there has been much}} scholarly debate over how it should be interpreted. John Maddicott saw the wording as a hostile warning to the new king to avoid the mistakes of his father, or face the consequences. J. R. S. Phillips, on the other hand, took the signatories to be positively inclined towards Edward II. There were others who were more intrinsic in their opposition to the king and Gaveston, primarily the Earl of Warwick. The purpose of the document, in Phillips view, was to present the king with a warning, and hopefully protect <b>him</b> <b>against</b> the more antagonistic members of the nobility.|$|E
5|$|Burnett {{took his}} seat in the 37th Congress; sources make no mention of his making good on his threat {{not to take the}} oath of office. Just days after the First Battle of Bull Run, Burnett's fellow Kentuckian, John J. Crittenden {{proposed}} a resolution blaming the war on the disloyal Southerners and defining the war's aim as preservation of the Union without interference in the rights or institutions of the states. Burnett asked that the question be divided. His request was granted, but he only found one colleague willing to vote with <b>him</b> <b>against</b> blaming Southerners for the war.|$|E

5|$|Domentziolus, however, {{is better}} known as a general in the Byzantine-Sassanid War of 602–628. Phocas's {{elevation}} to the throne had been recognized by neither the Sassanid Persian shah Khosrau II, nor by Narses, the Byzantine governor of the province of Mesopotamia. The two had allied against Phocas, with Narses gathering his forces in Edessa, while waiting for Sassanid reinforcements. In 604, Phocas appointed Domentziolus as magister militum per Orientem and sent <b>him</b> <b>against</b> the Persians. His predecessors Germanus and Leontius had both been defeated, the former killed in battle and the latter recalled and imprisoned by Phocas.|$|E
5|$|Edge of Darkness is a British {{television}} drama serial, {{produced by}} BBC Television {{in association with}} Lionheart Television International and originally broadcast in six fifty-five-minute episodes in late 1985. A mixture of crime drama and political thriller, it revolves around the efforts of policeman Ronald Craven (played by Bob Peck) to unravel the truth behind {{the murder of his}} daughter Emma (played by Joanne Whalley). Craven's investigations soon lead him into a murky world of government and corporate cover-ups and nuclear espionage, pitting <b>him</b> <b>against</b> dark forces that threaten the future of life on Earth.|$|E
5|$|II Napoleon {{ordered the}} {{assemblage}} of over 5,000 artillery for transport through the pass, {{despite the fact}} that the pass was widely considered to be much too narrow, and the route too volatile and unstable, to allow any form of artillery, light or heavy, to come through. Thus, Napoleons military advisers warned <b>him</b> <b>against</b> this move, but he insisted on this presence of this great number of artillery.|$|E

5|$|In the live-action film , Ayane is a ninja assassin and Kasumi's former servant who is {{dedicated}} to seeking out and killing her, as Kasumi is considered an outcast to the clan. Ayane first confronts Kasumi before she flees the temple, then several times on the island. She has romantic feelings towards Hayate (she is not his half-sister in the movie, and neither she is Kasumi's), and initially believes him to be dead. Ayane fails to kill Kasumi but finds Hayate and aids <b>him</b> <b>against</b> DOATEC. During the film's finale, she saves him from a potentially fatal fall.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that his last fight was an 85-minute contest at Shrewsbury in July 1790. This was widely reported in the London press and that of provincial cities but was subsequently denied by newspapers more local to the event. There were unsuccessful attempts after that date to match <b>him</b> <b>against</b> Ben Bryan (sometimes known as Ben Brian, Ben Brain or Ben Bryant), who had by that time defeated Johnson. Indeed, these attempts, conducted by Daniel Mendoza, did not help {{the cause of his}} employment with Boulton and Watt as the firm thought that they were a distraction and expressed concern regarding his commitment to his work.|$|E

When designing Shikamaru's Part II appearance, Kishimoto wanted to give Shikamaru a unique appearance despite drawing him with a vest that several other ninja wear in the series.

5|$|Matthew III Csák, whom Andrew {{had made}} palatine in 1296, turned against Andrew {{at the end}} of 1297. Andrew's staunch supporter, Archbishop Lodomer, died around the same time.
