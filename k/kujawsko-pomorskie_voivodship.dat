Material and Methods: The study focused on empirical data derived from hepatitis B Screening Programme in the <b>Kujawsko-Pomorskie</b> <b>voivodship.</b> The study comprised 6332 people tested for hepatitis B virus surface antigen – HBsAg. They had been hospitalized at least twice. The diagnostic survey was based on an anonymous questionnaire, developed for this study. For the statistical analysis the Statistica 10. 0 program was used. A level of statistical significance was assumed at a value of α = 0. 05. The results showing that the probability test p satisfy the inequality p < 0. 05 were considered to be statistically significant. Results: HBs antigen was detected in 34 patients (0. 54 %). There was no association between the detected infections and the gender of the respondents. There was no relationship between the detected infections and transfusion of blood and blood products before 1992. Surgical procedures performed in the patients did not increase the risk of hepatitis B infection. Conclusions: Actions aimed at detecting asymptomatic infections should primarily focus on the 35 – 39 age group. Effective identification of chronically-infected people and application of optimal treatment play a key role in reducing the risk of disease progression in the whole population. Therefore, the implementation of screening programs is warranted for prevention and early detection of hepatitis B. Med Pr 2014; 65 (6) : 777 – 78...|$|E
40|$|Social and {{economic}} phenomena in the spatial environment reflect the changes occurring in close and distant surroundings {{in which the}} globalization, metropolization and glocalization are observed. The knowledge-based economy brings the adaptation to new conditions and also ability of avoiding threats and taking opportunities. This {{is the reason why}} two, not far distant but competing towns have been encouraged to cooperate. In the paper the process of the metropolization is presented on the example of central towns of the <b>Kujawsko-Pomorskie</b> <b>Voivodship.</b> The selected aspects of this process have been taken into account, i. e. external determinants, formal reasons for integration and its signs presented in development strategies in comparison with social {{and economic}} potentials, and also institutions allowing the access to knowledge and innovation transfer among towns. The short description of these aspects has shown that slow changes with regard to the process of metropolization are observed...|$|E
