25|$|Although {{the deposit}} {{is in the}} hands of the credit card issuer as {{security}} in the <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>default</b> by the consumer, the deposit will not be debited simply for missing one or two payments. Usually the deposit is only used as an offset when the account is closed, either at the request of the customer or due to severe delinquency (150 to 180 days). This means that an account which is less than 150 days delinquent will continue to accrue interest and fees, and could result in a balance which is much higher than the actual credit limit on the card. In these cases the total debt may far exceed the original deposit and the cardholder not only forfeits their deposit but is left with an additional debt.|$|E
25|$|To {{determine}} a bond's rating, a credit rating agency analyzes {{the accounts of}} the issuer and the legal agreements attached to the bond to produce what is effectively a forecast of the bond's chance of default, expected loss, or a similar metric. The metrics vary somewhat between the agencies. S's ratings reflect default probability, while ratings by Moody's reflect expected investor losses {{in the case of}} default. For corporate obligations, Fitch's ratings incorporate a measure of investor loss in the <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>default,</b> but its ratings on structured, project, and public finance obligations narrowly measure default risk. The process and criteria for rating a convertible bond are similar, although different enough that bonds and convertible bonds issued by the same entity may still receive different ratings. Some bank loans may receive ratings to assist in wider syndication and attract institutional investors.|$|E
25|$|Corporate finance {{concerns}} the two money raising options for limited companies. Equity finance involves the traditional method of issuing shares {{to build up}} a company's capital. Shares can contain any rights the company and purchaser wish to contract for, but generally grant the right to participate in dividends after a company earns profits and the right to vote in company affairs. A purchaser of shares is helped to make an informed decision directly by prospectus requirements of full disclosure, and indirectly through restrictions on financial assistance by companies for purchase of their own shares. Debt finance means getting loans, usually {{for the price of a}} fixed annual interest repayment. Sophisticated lenders, such as banks typically contract for a security interest over the assets of a company, so that in the <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>default</b> on loan repayments they may seize the company's property directly to satisfy debts. Creditors are also, to some extent, protected by courts' power to set aside unfair transactions before a company goes under, or recoup money from negligent directors engaged in wrongful trading. If a company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due, UK insolvency law requires an administrator to attempt a rescue of the company (if the company itself has the assets to pay for this). If rescue proves impossible, a company's life ends when its assets are liquidated, distributed to creditors and the company is struck off the register. If a company becomes insolvent with no assets it can be wound up by a creditor, for a fee (not that common), or more commonly by the tax creditor (HMRC).|$|E

2500|$|Credit default swaps {{opened up}} {{important}} new avenues to speculators.

2500|$|In the <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>default</b> {{the buyer}} of the CDS {{receives}} compensation (usually the face {{value of the}} loan), and the seller of the CDS takes possession of the defaulted loan.

If there are more CDS contracts outstanding than bonds in existence, a protocol exists to hold a credit event auction; the payment received is usually substantially less than the face value of the loan.|$|E

Effectively, under the contractual terms of the ISDA Master Agreement, the non-Defaulting Party was able to preclude its own liability to pay by relying upon the occurrence of an <b>Event</b> <b>of</b> <b>Default</b> {{in relation to the}} other party and simply not exercising the right to terminate.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} a systematic framework of stochastic modelling and prediction <b>of</b> financial <b>default</b> risk <b>of</b> construction contractors. Net-worth-to-asset ratio is identified as an index for default process modelling. The default condition is defined as when the ratio becomes negative the first time. A mean-reverting dynamic model for the contractor default process is found by statistical analysis and is justified by using the theory of optimal capital structure. The stochastic modelling <b>of</b> <b>default</b> uses the time to default as the fundamental random variable. A discrete time trinomial Markov chain model is developed to assess default risk in terms <b>of</b> a cumulative <b>default</b> probability function, a default probability function, and the mean and variance <b>of</b> time to <b>default.</b> Practical examples are given to illustrate the stochastic methods. A default discriminant study on a group of contractors and publicly traded companies validates the methods, and indicates a high predictability <b>of</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>default</b> and declines <b>of</b> credit rating. ...|$|R
40|$|Provide a brief {{description}} of the issue and reason for the proposed amendment. If possible, provide a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the impacts of the issue on you and the IESO-administered markets. Include the Chapter and Section number of the relevant market rules. Background The market rules (sections 6. 3, 6. 4, 6. 5 of Chapter 3) provide for the suspension and termination of a market participant and disconnection of a facility for financial <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>default</b> and for persistent breaches of the market rules. The recent insolvencies of two market participants exposed gaps in the market rules relating to suspension, termination and disconnection for <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>default.</b> Among other things, these gaps create a risk that the market may be required to “carry ” a defaulting market participant for an extended period of time. The IESO is seeking to reduce this risk by streamlining the process and limiting or removing measures that duplicate legal protections available to a defaulting market participant outside of the market rules. At its meeting on June 28, 2007 the IESO Board reviewed these issues and provided a preliminary policy direction that the IESO undertake stakeholder consultation on amendments to the market rules to address these gaps identified and bring forward these amendments to the IESO Board for its review and consideration later in 2007. The IESO Board also directed the IESO to establish predetermined criteria for those instances in which the IESO seeks to convert an existing market rule obligation (shall) into a market rules permission (may). This would provide greater transparency to market participants with respect to the IESO’s process for invoking that discretion...|$|R
