5000|$|From field {{experiments}} she conducted (alongside then husband Karl Heider) in the 1970s {{with the}} Dani people of Papua New Guinea, Rosch concluded that when categorizing an everyday object or experience, people rely less on abstract <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>categories</b> {{than on a}} comparison of the given object or experience with what they deem to be the object or experience best representing a category. Although the Dani lack words for all the English colors (their language contained only two color terms dividing all colors into either the [...] "light, bright" [...] category or the [...] "dark, cool" [...] category), Rosch showed that they could still categorize objects by colors for which they had no words. She argued that basic objects have a psychological import that transcends cultural differences and shapes how such objects are mentally represented. She concluded that people in different cultures tend to categorize objects by using prototypes, although the prototypes of particular categories may vary.|$|E

The theoretical foundations of the issues are explored, including the classic philosophical and psychological views and the relatively new thoughts from experimental psychology on cognition.

40|$|Generic {{categories}} of aspects are described, {{and their potential}} value is explained. For some categories, broad classes of syntactically identifiable temporal properties, such as safety, liveness, or existence properties, are guaranteed to hold for a system with any aspect of the category woven into it, if the property was true in the system without the aspect. Thus classes of properties preserved by the aspect are defined. Moreover, relatively simple verification techniques are shown to hold for some classes of temporal properties over systems augmented with some other {{categories of}} aspects. Verification of new properties added by the aspects is also considered. Each category is {{defined in terms of}} the semantic transformation it makes to the state graphs of underlying systems. A generic procedure to identify syntactically when an aspect belongs to a category is described and related to existing code analysis systems that use static code analysis and dataflow techniques. The <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>categories,</b> identification procedures, and lemmas about property classes provide the needed foundations that justify and motivate automatic code analysis modules to identify aspect categories. The categories enable simpler proofs of correctness than would otherwise be possible, and exploiting their characteristics can aid in software development...|$|E
40|$|The {{categories}} {{referred to}} in textual descriptions are often defined by their context {Roth & Shoben, 1983). The results of experiments in this article suggest that inferences about the most typical exemplars of such categories are encoded to a high degree during reading. Subjects were presented with sentences that included contextual <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>categories</b> but did not mention any exemplars of the categories. When the most typical exemplars were presented for later recognition, subjects had difficulty (relative to a control) in correctly responding that the exemplar had not been explicitly presented. But when less typical exemplars were presented for recognition, subjects had no difficulty in rejecting them. The results for the less typical exemplars suggest that inferences about contextually defined categories are not {{made up of the}} defining and characteristic features of the categories because the less typical exemplars would match such inferences. Instead, the results suggest that the content of the inference is made up of information relating properties of the most typical exemplar to textual information.

30|$|The Pitman/Jones {{model of}} {{relative}} value measurement {{was published in}} Australasian Radiology in 2006 [2] {{on behalf of the}} Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists (RANZCR). The Australian relative value unit (RVU) system was adopted for this method, on the basis that it clearly separated radiologist, technologist and examination room utilisation costs, and that the radiologist cost is time-based. The general principle of the model is that “complex, large data-volume examinations with multiple images take a longer time to report, and consume more mental effort than studies with only a handful of images, such as a CXR. Another cardinal feature…is that the value of an examination depends on the number of regions covered; this is particularly so for CT, where a ‘chest/ abdomen/pelvis’ clearly takes more time and effort than a ‘chest’” [2]. Various simplifications were necessary to allow rapid calculation of a valid workload measurement across departments, for example grouping together some studies of differing complexity in one RVU category. The Faculty of Radiologists, RCSI, in turn adopted the Pitman/Jones model for our national survey, with a few slight modifications (assigning RVUs to intravenous urography studies and adjusting the <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>categories</b> of non-countable activity to reflect typical Irish radiology practices).|$|E
40|$|Ratio {{analysis}} is a financial analysis technique {{used by the}} corporate sector and public colleges and universities. Private {{colleges and universities have}} been largely unsuccessful utilizing this technique because of the varied accounting techniques used by the private institutions. This study attempted a different technique. The controllers of five institutions were asked to meet and agree on <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>categories</b> necessary for completing ratio analysis. Ratios are useful as a tool for monitoring financial changes over time within one institution, comparing similar institutions one with another and evaluating institutions in better financial condition for use as goal ratios. The resultant model consisted of a data dictionary which contained the definitions the controllers had created and iteratively refined, a data spreadsheet which contained the numbers over a five year period matching the definitions, and a ratio spreadsheet which presented the 58 ratios for each institution over a five year period. The controllers, acting as an expert panel for the study, believed the results to be reliable because of their level of involvement in setting the definitions and supplying the numbers. Average ratios were also calculated using the data from all five institutions over all five years. All resulting spreadsheets are contained in their entirety in the dissertation.

40|$|Aim. This paper {{presents}} {{a discussion of}} the need for standardisation in definitions of different categories of nurse internationally. Background. Historical experience and health service modernisation partly account for the variation seen in definitions of what a ‘nurse’ is from country to country. As clinical roles evolve, often in poorly controlled and ad hoc ways, the question of ‘what is a nurse?’ may only become more confusing. Data Sources. OECD Health Data for 2010, literature from the International Council of Nurses and international literature on ‘skill mix’ and ‘scope of practice’ were consulted for this paper. Discussion. It is unclear if international disparities in nursing provision apparent in, for e. g. OECD health data, demonstrate real differences in staffing patterns or simply reflect the wide variations in understanding and use of terms for different categories of nurse. Implications for Nursing. Standardisation of <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>categories</b> of nurse internationally should reduce confusion and allow better understanding of patterns of nurse staffing and the effect these have on patient outcomes. Conclusion. Until proper consensus is reached on what a nurse is and does, any skill mix or role boundary exercises will only ever be locally or at best nationally relevant and not useful outside of that. If nursing qualifications are to be valid even across the EU, then recommended standards such as those of ICN, must be specified in terms of what different nursing practitioners actually can do, and their responsibilities and roles within tha...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} {{methods to}} harmonize {{the classification of}} age-related macular degeneration (AMD) phenotypes across four population-based cohort studies: the Beaver Dam Eye Study (BDES), the Blue Mountains Eye Study (BMES), the Los Angeles Latino Eye Study (LALES), and the Rotterdam Study (RS). METHODS: AMD grading protocols, <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>categories,</b> and grading forms from each study were compared {{to determine whether there}} were systematic differences in AMD severity definitions and lesion categorization among the three grading centers. Each center graded the same set of 60 images using their respective systems to determine presence and severity of AMD lesions. A common 5 -step AMD severity scale and definitions of lesion measurement cutpoints and early and late AMD were developed from this exercise. RESULTS: Applying this severity scale changed the age-sex adjusted prevalence of early AMD from 18. 7 % to 20. 3 % in BDES, from 4. 7 % to 14. 4 % in BMES, from 14. 1 % to 15. 8 % in LALES, and from 7. 5 % to 17. 1 % in RS. Age-sex adjusted prevalences of late AMD remained unchanged. Comparison of each center's grades of the 60 images converted to the consortium scale showed that exact agreement of AMD severity among centers varied from 61. 0 - 81. 4 %, and one-step agreement varied from 84. 7 - 98. 3 %. CONCLUSION: Harmonization of AMD classification reduced categorical differences in phenotypic definitions across the studies, resulted in a new 5 -step AMD severity scale, and enhanced similarity of AMD prevalence among the four cohorts.
