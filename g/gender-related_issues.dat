Though Wicca was predominantly practiced by women, Wiccan Brigade welcomed men also. Chakraverti commented, [...] "Close to 100 people, comprising professionals, some housewives and many students, have approached me on the Net to start the group. I think it’s the right time to institutionalize Wicca. [...] Though it wouldn’t be possible to have here the kind of training we had in the Laurentians, there would be sessions on yoga and meditation, and lectures and group discussions." [...] A batch of 25 people were selected through a screening process and they [...] participated in the sessions consisting of social, historical, psychological and <b>gender-related</b> <b>issues</b> of Wicca. In July 2007, the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions (NCMEI) nominated Chakraverti to head a panel tasked with improving the status of young girls in India.

5000|$|Local {{ownership}} {{has been}} recognised {{as a key}} pillar in ensuring that SSR is both implemented correctly and sustainable. Local ownership of SSR is characterised by [...] "the reform of security policies, institutions and activities in a given country must be designed, managed and implemented by local actors rather than external actors" [...] and is notably distinct from local support for donor programmes and projects. Given that security and justice needs vary by gender, {{it is important to}} ensure that people of different genders are consulted and involved in an SSR process. In practice, this can be achieved by involving women's groups, youth groups and other organisations that work on <b>gender-related</b> security <b>issues</b> such as human trafficking, gang violence and human rights. Such groups can serve as a crucial bridge between local communities and SSR policymakers, strengthening local ownership through communicating security and justice needs to policymakers and raising awareness of SSR in local communities.|$|R
50|$|In recent decades, Vietnam has {{stressed}} the importance of gender equality. To address this goal, the Vietnam Women's Union, an organization founded in 1930 under the Vietnam Communist Party, has pursued the advancement of women in many arenas; however, they also stress many aspects of Confucian doctrine that keeps a male-dominated hierarchy in place. As of 2000, their membership has expanded to 11 million, which compromises for 60% of the female population in Vietnam over the age of 18. Because of their large membership, the Vietnam Women's Union has frequently been regarded as the representative for women in politics.

Figures and/or pictures may be missing from this format of the document. *** Although the literature of librarianship is replete with personality studies, which purport to link the psychological characteristics of librarians with problems of stereotype, professional image, professional status, and occupational prestige, most assume that the only negative Image is that associated with the female stereotype. Only rarely have feminist studies challenged the assumptions upon which such claims are based, {{due to the fact}} that men's studies in the field have been virtually nonexistent. This article reports the results of a survey of male librarians relating to the existence and nature of the male professional stereotype, and the impact of social expectations and <b>gender-related</b> work <b>issues</b> on the attitudes of male library and information professionals. Because male librarians are rarely studied as men, it was necessary to design an exploratory instrument. Although categorically ranked responses provided indicators of general attitudes towards gender-status issues, open-ended comments revealed a greater diversity of attitudes than had been previously supposed. The study illumines an unexplored area of research in the field, and establishes the need for further qualitative research in the area of gender studies in librarianship. Article...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{aim of the}} {{doctoral}} thesis was to develop and test a theoretical model seeking to describe the aetiological role of psychosocial processes, {{in and out of}} the workplace, in predicting <b>gender-related</b> diversity <b>issues</b> in men's and women's health at a structural/population level. An iterative multi-stage methodology was utilised to develop and test the proposed theoretical model. A structured literature review was conducted to provide a theoretical foundation to inform theory development. Subsequently, a series of multivariate model building statistics were conducted to further develop and validate the specified theoretical model. A subsample derived from the fourth European Working Conditions Survey was utilised (n= 9720). A cross validation process was utilised to examine the reliability and validity of the observed findings. Several significant gender differences in self-reported health, working conditions, psychosocial hazards, and domestic duties were observed. The magnitude of the detected gender differences ranged from small to moderately large. The results of the exploratory and confirmatory model statistics found a total of six direct predictive pathways in relation to common health complaints (CHC), these included: exposure to ambient hazards, social support at work, time pressure, psychologically demanding work and job security. Gender was observed to moderate two of these direct pathways: namely, time pressure and psychologically demanding work to CHC. At first glance, a moderated relationship between exposure to ambient hazards and CHC was observed. However, insufficient levels of variance were present in the male-only samples. Therefore, the predictive accuracy of this finding cannot be concluded. In addition, a fully mediated relationship between long working hours and CHC by work-life balance, and a partially mediated relationship between flexible work organisation and CHC by work-life balance was found. Neither of these mediated pathways were observed to be moderated by gender. The implications to research, policy, and workplace practices are discussed in the concluding chapter of the thesis.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{gender and}} {{performance}} in the GCE A level examination. It attempts to acquire {{deeper understanding of the}} factors that contribute to differential performance at 18 +. It identifies a 'cross-over' in gender related patterns of performance in examinations between 16 + and 18 +, uses a multi-method approach and a number of sources of data to explain the complex patterns observed. This thesis aims to identify the various factors that contribute to differential performance in examinations and to assess the extent of their influence. The impetus for the research stemmed from a concern that the A level examination has been relatively under-researched in relation to gender-equity issues in examination attainment. Previously, the focus of gender-related differences in examination performance had tended to concentrate on the compulsory stage of schooling. Little is known, therefore, about <b>gender-related</b> performance <b>issues</b> at 18 +. In this questions specifically focus on the A level examination and are asked in relation to: how we account for gender-related differences in performance; the contribution of the assessment techniques used to these differences and whether there are content, contexts and tasks types used in these examinations that benefit one gender more than another. Data has been collected, analysed and interpreted from over 3, 000 examination scripts, 200 questionnaire responses from secondary school teachers and nine school case studies. Teachers' and students' attitudes to, and perceptions of, gender-related attainment at 18 + are explored for their contribution to differential performance. Three subjects - English literature, mathematics and physics - are used to illustrate the issues that are being considered. This thesis contributes knowledge to the gender-equity debate at {{one of the most significant}} stages of examining in the UK. The debate is a complex one and the findings of this thesis reflect this. In this thesis, evidence from the data suggests that any future consideration of equity in relation to examination performance must concern itself not only with the assessment techniques used in the examination system, but also with the expectations, experiences and perceptions of teachers and students who are involved in these examinations. ...|$|R

The paper is structured as follows: 1. A review of literature on the determinants of growth and development and the analysis of the catching up process between countries or groups of countries. 2. An analysis of the historic roots and origins of the development gap, and its evolvement over time. 3. A review of literature sources, draft analysis of primary statistical data, and qualitative explanations of gaps and divergences in selected development issues across the following socio-economic dimensions: level of economic development and convergence rates based on Real GDP (application of methodology testing 3 ̆b 2 and 3 ̆c 3 convergence to the set of countries analyzed); * quality of life and its components (poverty, inequality, health status and health care, access to fresh water and sanitation facilities, subjective perceptions of well-being); * human capital and labor market development, including level of education and public spending on education, its accessibility and quality, main differences in labor market development (employment participation rates and levels of unemployment, new jobs creation and labor protection legislation); * innovation potential, including R&D, information and communication technologies, and institutional environment; * openness and trade potential, including trade in goods and services, FDI stocks, trade regime and performance in logistics and infrastructure; * environmental performance in terms of environmental stresses, efforts aimed at their reduction, and institutional capacity; * business climate, political institutions, and other institutional indicators (econometric analysis). 4.
