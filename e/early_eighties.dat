5|$|The {{release of}} Ultime grida dalla savana {{initiated}} a rivalry between Climati and Morra {{and two other}} Italian Mondo film makers, Angelo and Alfredo Castiglioni. These two filmmaking teams became the frontrunners of the Mondo genre {{in the late seventies}} and <b>early</b> <b>eighties.</b> The Castiglionis had made two previous Mondo films, Africa segreta and Africa ama, before the release of Ultime grida dalla savana. They later released three additional films: Magia nuda in 1975, Addio ultimo uomo in 1978, Africa dolce e selvaggio in 1982. Climati and Morra made two follow-up films to Ultime grida dalla savana. The first followup, Savana violenta, also known as Savage Man Savage Beast no. 2, was released in 1976. Savana violenta was slightly less graphic in its depiction of violence. The last film, Dolce e selvaggio, was released in 1983 and consisted partly of outtakes and recycled footage from Climati and Morra's two previous films. Each subsequent release by the two parties would attempt to outperform the previous films with more explicit and shocking content.|$|E

5000|$|Concordia was {{originally}} {{established as a}} Rhenish mission station in 1852 and copper mining began in 1853 through to 1983 in the area. The town is of historical interest because it is situated at the origin of mining endeavors in South Africa. Long before colonial times (prior to 1652), the indigenous peoples (the Khoisan or Nama) of the area extracted raw or [...] "native copper" [...] from the gneiss and granite hills {{that make up the}} surrounding Namaqualand Copper belt. This copper was beaten into decorative items, worn as bangles and neck adornments by these peoples.

25|$|In the <b>early</b> <b>eighties,</b> Mitsubishi Motors {{also wanted}} to renew its aging Debonair model, which had not been {{substantially}} updated since its market launch in 1964.

As Hyundai was an official sponsor of 1988 Seoul Olympics, it used this opportunity to notify all the executives and important people about their new car, the Grandeur. Because of its Mitsubishi basis and good quality, it became very popular in Korea.|$|E

In the <b>early</b> <b>eighties</b> road number 44 was rebuilt to contain four short runways (17 x 800 metres). Along the road a large number of turn-around-sites for rearming and refueling were built. These short runways are still used today for training, landing and taking off with Gripen and Hercules as preparation for international operations under adverse conditions.|$|E
25|$|Type I IFNs form {{a family}} of several proteins: in humans, there are 13 α subtypes, 1 β subtype, 1 ω subtype and other less studied subtypes (κ and ε). IFNα2 was the first subtype to be {{characterized}} in the <b>early</b> <b>eighties.</b> As a result, IFNα2 was widely used in basic research to elucidate biological activities, structure and mechanism of action of type I IFNs. IFNα2 {{was also the first}} IFN to be produced by the pharmaceutical industry for use as a drug. Thereby, IFNα2 is the best known type I IFN subtype. The properties of IFNα2 are widely shared by the other type I IFNs, although subtle differences exist.|$|E

Brian Setzer went on to solo success working in both rockabilly and swing styles, while Rocker and Phantom continued to record in bands both together and singly.

40|$|Some elements, even {{unconventional}} tillage {{systems have}} come to the attention of both research and production activities starting from the <b>early</b> nineteen <b>eighties.</b> Although research in the pilot lands have revealed promising results, until recently they remained unsolicited. The main factor that has supported such a situation was the total dependence to conventional farming systems, based on plowing, and this is supported by the low prices practiced by energy agents and also by the low prices of mineral fertilizers. In addition, in relation to economic interests, conventional systems materialized into increased land productivity and income. At the same time, in relation to ecologic balance, they have produced profound changes, evidenced by increased vulnerability to the actions of various soil degradation processes, diseases and pests and the emergence of new limiting factors...|$|R
