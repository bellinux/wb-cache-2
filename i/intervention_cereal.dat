40|$|The EU took clear {{steps to}} {{suppress}} and abandon {{the intervention of}} maize in 2006. Originally the measure should have been revised {{in the course of}} the “Health Check”. But the European Commission (EC) rendered the minimal quality requirement for maize stricter in the intervention period starting 1 November 2006. Later the EC proposed to finish the intervention of maize. According to that decision the intervention of maize exists in the marketing year of 2007 / 08 and 2008 / 09 with a quantity limitation but it finishes in the marketing year of 2009 / 10. The EC argues for the abandonment of maize intervention, because, intervention stocks of cereals have increased significantly after the accession of the 10 new member states (EU- 10), and the balance of the maize market is at risk. This measure is aimed to get back the intervention to its original purpose, as a safety net. We prove in this study that the intervention stock of cereal has not significantly increased after the enlargement in 2004 and it is not a reason for finishing maize intervention. The intervention stock of maize has increased since 2004 but not so significantly that it could be a reason for the abandonment of maize <b>intervention.</b> <b>cereal,</b> intervention, maize, stock, Agricultural and Food Policy, Agricultural Finance,...|$|E

Statistical evidence is provided about the two record years of intervention in Hungary proving that farmers did not take part in intervention though the system was sought to be tailored to farmers needs. Intervention purchases {{took place at the}} wholesale level and traders were the most active participants in both intervention periods. This dynamic intervention activity of traders will significantly alter the Hungarian trade sector by bringing it closer to the physical processes of the cereal chain. As to the size of intervention, the great volume of the purchase of maize has resulted in an exceptionally severe problem considering the large surplus of Hungarian cereals. Recently, the Commission hampered maize intervention in Hungary by excluding this crop from <b>cereals</b> eligible for <b>intervention.</b> This measure is criticised in the paper, as we deem it unnecessary in recent market conditions, and in our view it doesn't make up the compulsory need for a complex reconsideration of recent EU cereal policy on the long term.

40|$|Nitrogen {{pollution}} {{resulting from}} agricultural activities {{is a major}} threat {{to the quality of the}} European environment. This paper aims to qualify the importance of nutritional management in reducing nitrogen pollution from intensive livestock production and to quantify its potential results where applicable. Reform of agricultural policy may achieve the economic and environmental benefits of reducing nitrogen pollution in the European Union. The reform in 1992 of the arable crop regime of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), reducing <b>cereal</b> <b>intervention</b> price, significantly lowered the cost of reducing the protein content of compound feed. The consequent reduction in feed costs enabled the pig and poultry sectors to apply nutritional management measures to reduce nitrogen output without compromising profitability throughout the production chain. However, the world market price of soybean meal is shown to influence the effectiveness of a reduction in cereal prices due to CAP-reform. Hence small incentives, complementary with CAP reform, may be necessary to ensure that the shift towards environmentally friendly practices in feed formulation remains permanent. In order to minimise the negative effects on nitrogen pollution of low prices of soya and protein-based raw materials, environmental protection measures may be required to ensure low dietary protein levels in feed formulations. agriculture; CAP; Nitrates Directive; nitrogen pollution. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Poor {{micronutrient}} {{status is}} reported among adolescents across Europe and USA. This {{may be related}} to the well-documented decline in the regular consumption of breakfast by this group. The regular consumption of a breakfast cereal offers a possible means to improve micronutrient status; fortified cereal is likely to have enhanced benefit. A study was conducted to determine the efficacy of the regular consumption of a fortified cereal with milk, compared with unfortified cereal, consumed either as a breakfast or a supper, in improving micronutrient intake and micronutrient status of adolescent girls. Methods: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention trial was conducted in girls recruited at ages 16 – 19 years, from schools and colleges in Sheffield, UK. Girls were randomised to receive 50 g fortified or unfortified cereal, with 150 ml semi-skimmed milk, daily, for 12 weeks, as a breakfast or as a supper. Dietary intake was estimated using a 4 -d food diary and blood collected for the assessment of nutritional status. Within-group changes were tested using a paired sample t test; two-way ANOVA was used to analyse effects of the <b>intervention,</b> with <b>cereal</b> type and time of consumption as factors, correcting for baseline values. The analysis was conducted on 71 girls who completed the study. Results: Consumption of unfortified cereal elicited an increase in the intake of vitamins B 1, B 2 and B 6; consumption of fortified cereal elicited increases in vitamins B 1, B 2, B 6, B 12, folate and iron (P[*]<[*] 0. 001) and of vitamin D (P[*]=[*] 0. 007), all increases were significantly greater than for unfortified cereal. Consumption of the fortified cereal also led to a significant improvement in biomarkers of status for vitamins B 2, B 12, folate and of iron, compared with girls receiving the unfortified cereal, and maintained vitamin D status, in contrast with the girls receiving the unfortified cereal (P[*]<[*] 0. 001). Conclusions: The daily consumption of cereal with milk for 12 weeks by adolescent girls, increased intakes of micronutrients. The consumption of fortified cereal elicited greater increases than for unfortified cereal and improved biomarkers of micronutrient status.

Objective: The {{objective was to}} identify biomarkers of response to a dietary supplementation with an isoflavone extract in postmenopausal women by proteome analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Design: The study with healthy postmenopausal woman was performed in a placebo-controlled sequential design. Peripheral mononuclear blood cells were collected from 10 volunteers after 8 wk of receiving daily 2 placebo cereal bars and after a subsequent 8 wk of <b>intervention</b> with 2 <b>cereal</b> bars each providing 25 mg of isoflavones. The proteome of the cells was visualized after 2 -dimensional gel electrophoresis, and peptide mass fingerprinting served to identify proteins that by the intervention displayed altered protein concentrations. Results: Twenty-nine proteins were identified that showed significantly altered expression in the mononuclear blood cells under the soy-isoflavone intervention, including a variety of proteins involved in an antiinflammatory response. Heat shock protein 70 or a lymphocyte-specific protein phosphatase and proteins that promote increased fibrinolysis, such as a-enolase, were found at increased intensities, whereas those that mediate adhesion, migration, and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, such as galectin- 1, were found at reduced intensities after soy extract consumption. Conclusion: Protcome analysis identified in vivo markers that respond to a dietary intervention with isoflavone-enriched soy extract in postmenopausal women. The nature of the proteins identified suggests that soy isoflavones may increase the anti inflammatory response in blood mononuclear cells that might contribute to the atherosclerosis-preventive activities of a soy-rich diet...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{near-infrared}} (NIR) hyperspectral imaging {{has proved}} its suitability for quality and safety {{control in the}} cereal sector by allowing spectroscopic images to be collected at single-kernel level, which is {{of great interest to}} cereal control laboratories. Contaminants in cereals include, inter alia, impurities such as straw, grains from other crops, and insects, as well as undesirable substances such as ergot (sclerotium of Claviceps purpurea). For the cereal sector, the presence of ergot creates a high toxicity risk for animals and humans because of its alkaloid content. A study was undertaken, in which a complete procedure for detecting ergot bodies in cereals was developed, based on their NIR spectral characteristics. These were used to build relevant decision rules based on chemometric tools and on the morphological information obtained from the NIR images. The study sought to transfer this procedure from a pilot online NIR hyperspectral imaging system at laboratory level to a NIR hyperspectral imaging system at industrial level and to validate the latter. All the analyses performed showed that the results obtained using both NIR hyperspectral imaging cameras were quite stable and repeatable. In addition, a correlation higher than 0. 94 was obtained between the predicted values obtained by NIR hyperspectral imaging and those supplied by the stereo-microscopic method which is the reference method. The validation of the transferred protocol on blind samples showed that the method could identify and quantify ergot contamination, demonstrating the transferability of the method.

40|$|In our paper, we briefly {{discuss the}} outlook for the main {{agricultural}} sectors in Hungary until 2013, and present {{some of the latest}} results of our modelling work at the Research Institute for Agricultural Economics (AKI). In addition, we provide a short methodological overview of the applied modelling tools. To strengthen the quantitative analysis capacity during the pre-accession period, AKI developed a partial equilibrium model (Hungarian Simulation Model or HUSIM) {{by the end of the}} 1990 's. Since then, AKI has been regularly carrying out agricultural policy analyses by applying this economic model. After gathering experiences with HUSIM, strong demand was raised on a modelling tool that enables us to investigate the structural changes in agriculture in more depth by focusing on the main sectors and their interrelationships. According to this concept, a partial equilibrium model, FARM-T was developed, which uses farm groups as agents to investigate the changes in agricultural output and the underlying structural progress. The first part of our paper describes the concept and structure of this model in more detail. In the second part, we focus our investigation on the changes in production structure and competitiveness on domestic and foreign markets. Only a few years after EU accession, Hungarian farmers again face considerable challenges: due to the full or partial decoupling of Complementary National Direct Payments already in 2007, the expected introduction of the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) in 2009, the probable abolishing of the EU <b>cereals</b> <b>intervention</b> regime, and the compulsory blending of bio-fuels, major changes in the agricultural sectors are foreseen.

40|$|A Commission Memorandum of January 22 nd 2003 {{sets out}} in question-and-answer format {{the case for}} the {{implementation}} of the Commission's proposals for further reform of the CAP. The questions addressed are: Why is it necessary to reform European agricultural policy now? What is the CAP reform looking to achieve? Didn't the Brussels Council of October 2002 exclude further CAP reforms? What is the rationale behind proposing new rural development measures? What does de-coupling mean in practical terms? Does de-coupling mean paying farmers for doing nothing? Will the reform lead to a shrinking farm production harming farmers and industry? What will happen to farmers' incomes? What does de-coupling mean in WTO terms? How would cross-compliance be applied? What is the advantage of introducing a Farm Advisory System? What is the Commission's intention for the dairy industry? Why introduce such a radical price cut for rice? Why cut <b>intervention</b> prices for <b>cereals?</b> Why exclude rye from intervention? Will the proposals for the CAP reform result in a real simplification? Significant points highlighted in the memo include: only a 7 % reduction in beef production is expected, with farmers gaining from improved prices and net incomes increasing; the EU will remain an exporter of beef; the EU will remain a significant exporter of cereals; the proposals will {{have a positive effect on}} the EU food industry by reducing the costs of raw materials; market balances will be significantly improved; overall farm incomes will increase by 1. 7 %; reform would place a larger percentage of EU farm aid in the 'green box' making it easier to defend in the WTO.

40|$|The article {{describes}} the evolution and future of the set-aside system of the European Union. The focus is on Finland s integration to the system. The future developments are evaluated from Finland s point of view. To {{be eligible for the}} compensatory payments introduced as part of the CAP reform for arable crops, producers must set aside a portion of their arable land with a view to achieving a better balance between production and domestic and international demand. The set-aside rate was fixed at 15 % for the rotational set-aside and 20 % (18 % in the UK and Denmark) for other forms of set-aside. The set-aside requirements do not appeal small producers producing less than 92 tons cereals a year. Because of bad harvests in certain areas of the world combined with effective production control measures, for the marketing year 1995 / 96, the set-aside rate was cut to 12 % (15 % and 17 %). During the year 1995, the <b>intervention</b> stocks of <b>cereals</b> continuously decreased and world market prices increased. Consequently, the EU decided to cut the set-aside rate to 10 % for the 1996 / 97 marketing year. As usual, the reduction only applies for the 1996 / 97 marketing year. For the year 1997 / 98, the portion will automatically revert to 15 % (and 18 % and 20 %). The cut of set-aside rate serve the interest of major cereals- producing countries. Finland is obliged to pay her share of the costs without getting any advantage. Finland s interest would probably be to increase the set-aside rate. This is because, within a certain range, (a) the change of the obligatory set-aside rate barely affects the set-aside area in Finland; (b) the change of the obligatory set-aside rate barely affects the cereals production in Finland; and (c) the change of the cereals-production area barely affects the farm income in Finland. The discussion concerning the future development of the EU set-aside system should include the following themes: (a) is the current cereals shortage a temporal or continuous phenomenon; (b) as a high set-aside rate helps to keep cereal prices up, farmers would gain in the form of high producer prices and the tax payers would gain in the form of low export subsidies (or high export taxes); (c) because the increase of set-aside rate is more difficult than the cut, the cuts should be postpo ned if possible; (b) an alternative way to increase production is to rise the farm-by-farm ceiling of 92 tons (that makes the set-aside obligatory), rather than to cut the set-aside rate; and (e) for environmental reasons, the set-aside area shou ld be covered with plants. vokMTT Taloustutkimus (MTTL) The temporal cut of the EU set-aside requirements for the 1996 / 97 marketing year: consequences for Finlan...|$|R
40|$|Up to {{one hundred}} million people in sub-Saharan Africa will have died before The Pandemic is over' is how Stephen Lewis, Special Envoy of the UN Secretary-General for HIV/AIDS in Africa, put it at a special meeting on Diseases without Borders, during the annual Conference of Montreal (Canada) early in May 2003. Talking to Spore before his speech, rehearsing awhile, he promised to pay at least "a nod to {{agriculture}}". It was {{to be more of}} a knock than a nod: he put agriculture at the top of the list of sectors most affected by HIV/AIDS ? above education, above health. An epidemic has become 'The Pandemic' meaning a disease affecting all (Greek: pan) people (demos) in large region(s). In 2 short years, the language of those who normally err on the side of caution - diplomats and doctors - has become dramatic, almost desperate. Life ends at 40, again In just a dozen years, the time it takes for a fortunate child to complete school, from 1998 to 2010, the average life expectancy of a person in Botswana will have fallen from the once-predicted 66 years to 35 years, according to UNAIDS, the UN's joint agency programme. In Haiti, by 2005 it will have fallen by 6 years; in Burkina Faso by 8, Mozambique 11. Between 1985 and 2001, FAO estimates that in the 27 most affected African countries, 7 million agricultural workers died from AIDS. The impact is well known and already scary enough: remote fields abandoned, nearby fields over-used and under-maintained; switches to crops requiring less labour, with the loss of variety in diets and of income; neglect, or selling off, of livestock; breakdown of extension and support services; diversion of scarce funds and credit to medical care, funerals and food, with subsequent defaults on loans and sales of assets - though rarely sales of land. Impact assessed: hurt In a detailed study by FAO of the Bondo and Busia districts of Kenya, the number of married households fell from the already AIDS-scarred level of 80 % of all households in 1992 to 60 % in 2002. Female-headed households (FHHs) rose from 17 % to 30 %, and orphan-headed households (OHHs), learning parenting with no parents, from 3 % to 10 %. Most FHHs had access, through hire and loans, to draught animals; while 90 % of grandparent- headed and 100 % of OHHs had only hand-power. Half of them had a hoe, but did any have a future? That was yesterday, and yesterday has gone. Today is tougher. Take this report, mid-May 2003, from the Southern African Development Community: "Even where the maize harvest is quite good, the fact that we have such high HIV infection rates requires more livelihood support <b>interventions.</b> Good <b>cereal</b> production may not be enough to sustain people as it would 10 years ago. " Tomorrow will be different. The FAO predicts 16 million more deaths of agricultural workers by 2020. One in 4 workers in Namibia; 1 in 5 in South Africa; 1 in 6 in Kenya; 1 in 7 in Malawi; 1 in 8 in the Central African Republic. A different tomorrow indeed. Mitigate we must The response of families, villages and regional structures is, and shall no doubt remain, massive, with millions of cases of solidarity and coping. The single example of the Livingstone Widows Association in Zambia is moving enough, where a group of widows set up a micro-savings and credit scheme to help their home gardens flourish and to generate more income. Such innovative spirit, and changes to the rules, are sorely needed in institutional approaches, as in the case of CARE-Zambia which, itself affected by personnel losses, has restructured its medical and agricultural extension work, in effect providing an AIDS response to its farming operations. Elsewhere, typical of the openness now present in donor bodies, Germany's technical cooperation agency GTZ encourages all projects to build AIDS-response components into their budgets. The key areas for attention are: to reorganise extension and credit; to re-design agricultural equipment; to empower affected communities to diversify production; and to ensure that local knowledge is recorded and passed from generation to fast-changing generation. All with more focus on women, youth and the elderly. It requires inspiration - perhaps more than can come from simply facing adversity - and resources. Much of both is coming, from the 'impact mitigation' to which the Member States at a special session of the UN General Assembly committed themselves in 2001 alongside prevention, care and treatment. The resources are on their way, enhanced by the decisions in May and early June 2003 of the United States and the European Union to drastically increase the funds ? and medicines ? available for developing countries. Adjustment to The Pandemic While it is on the farm that much direct impact is being felt, and while it is the poor who are most vulnerable to infection and lack of care, and while it is their coping strategies that have to be replicated, we are all directly affected - we all have a new task. We have to learn to manage our societies where, in the course of three decades, we shall have lost, day by tragic day, up to one in five of our farmers, millers, marketers, teachers, scholars, doctors, planners, ministers, editors, bankers, poets, friends and neighbours. Interdependency has never been more visible. It took a while, in the 1990 s, for governments to realise the complexity of the issue, but they did so. Anna Abdallah, Minister for Health of Tanzania, told Spore. "It's not just an issue for Health - every Ministry has to be involved and have its approach.

40|$|The European Commission's {{proposed}} {{regulations for}} further {{reform of the}} cereals, rice, dried fodder, and dairy sectors have been published. The regulations cover: direct aid schemes; support for rural development; the common organisation {{of the market in}} cereals; the common organisation of the market in rice; the common organisation of the market in dried fodder; the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products; the levy on milk and milk products. In addition to reiterating the general concept behind the process of CAP reform, the explanatory memorandum sets out the impact of the proposed reforms. The Commission claims that the 'adjustments proposed will complement the EU's international objective of ensuring that developing countries fully benefit from the expansion of world trade, while maintaining food security'. This will be achieved through reducing export availability, 'thereby contributing to stronger world market prices, which {{is in the interest of}} the agricultural sector in developing countries'. The reform process will also 'provide a sustainable and predictable policy framework for the European Model of Agriculture'. The Commission also emphasises that the reform process will require additional budgetary expenditures since farmers' incomes will need to be maintained. With regard to individual products the cereals-sector proposal would result in: a 5 % reduction in the <b>cereals</b> <b>intervention</b> price to € 95. 30 /tonnee from 2004 / 05; the abolition of seasonal corrections; and the end of intervention for rye. Area payments will be increased from € 63 to € 66 /tonne with these payments being included in the single farm payment. For protein crops the current support payment will be maintained and converted into a crop specific area payment of € 55. 57 /ha. For rice a one-step reduction in the intervention price by 50 % to an effective support price of € 150 /tonne, in line with world prices, is proposed, with direct aid being increased from € 52 /tonnee to € 177 /tonne. € 102 of this will be part of the single-farm payment, paid on the basis of historical rights, while € 75 /tonne multiplied by a specified yield will be paid as crop-specific aid. A private storage scheme will be introduced, to be triggered when the market price falls below the effective support price. In addition special measures will be triggered when market prices fall below € 120 /tonne. Proposals are also put forward for durum wheat, dairy products, starch, potatoes, dried fodder, seeds and nuts. Against this background a single farm payment will replace most of the premia under different common organisations of the market. This will cover arable crops, beef and veal, milk and dairy, sheep and goats, starch potatoes, grain legumes, rice, seeds, dried fodder. As the Commission explains it 'this single farm payment will be broken down into payment entitlements in order to facilitate their transfer. Each entitlement will be calculated by dividing the reference amount by the number of hectares, which gave rise to this amount in the reference years'. The new payment system will be linked to cross compliance with EU standards in the fields of environment, food safety, animal health and welfare and occupational safety. Accompanying these measures the EU will strengthen the rural-development pillar of the CAP. Comment: The development of the most immediate significance to the ACP concerns the rice sector, where the reduction in the EU price is likely to lead to dramatic income losses for Guyana and Surinam. According to the FAPRI study (see last edition) rice-sector reform will also lead to a 20 % expansion in EU rice production, despite an estimated 41 % decline in the EU market price of rice. With such an increase in production, EU exports are likely to rise substantially. These predicted developments sit uneasily with the European Commission's assertion that reform will reduce export availability. The sustainability of the European Model of Agriculture will be achieved by reducing the attractiveness of the EU market to below that of the world market, thereby doing away with the need for both tariff protection and export refunds. It should be noted that when the European Commission asserts a reduction in production as a result of reform, this is in comparison with production levels which would have been attained without the introduction of reform and is not with reference to current production levels. With reference to current production levels, The FAPRI study suggests that post reform production levels will be higher in all major products except barley and beef. It should be borne in mind that with the budgetary ceiling fixed, further reform is likely to be more difficult to secure agreement on, since new expenditures will need to be financed from saving elsewhere in the CAP budget. This will require hard negotiations in the EU Council and this could well slow down the pace of reform, particularly if the US$/euro exchange rate makes export refunds more expensive.

40|$|Over {{fifteen years}} have elapsed since the {{transition}} from the centrally planned economic system started in the early 1990 's. During this time agricultural and rural areas of Central and Eastern Europe have undergone profound structural changes with wide variations in the degree of transformation and in the rate of success in creating a competitive market and private ownership based food and agricultural system. By becoming member of the European Union the 'transition' in its traditional interpretation has been concluded in ten of the Central East European countries. The transition to market based agriculture, however, is far from completion in Southern and Eastern Europe and especially in the CIS countries.

40|$|In {{the words}} of the European Commission, the June 26 th 2003 {{agreement}} on CAP reform will mean that 'in future, the vast majority of subsidies will be paid independently from the volume of production'. However 'member states may choose to maintain a limited link between subsidy and production under well-defined conditions and within clear limits'. The single farm payment system will enter into force in 2005. However, member states may get a special dispensation to apply it only from 2007. The key elements of the reform package as agreed are:  a single farm payment for EU farmers, independent from production; limited coupled elements may be maintained to avoid abandonment of production; this payment will be linked to respect for environmental, food-safety, animal and plant health and animal-welfare standards, as well as the requirement to keep all farmland in good agricultural and environmental condition ('cross compliance'); a strengthened rural-development policy with more EU money, new measures to promote the quality of the environment and animal welfare, and to help farmers to meet EU production standards starting in 2005; a reduction in direct payments ('modulation') for bigger farms to finance the new rural development policy; a mechanism for financial discipline to ensure that the farm budget fixed until 2013 is not overshot; revisions to the market policy of the CAP involving: asymmetric price cuts in the milk sector; reduction of the monthly increments in the cereals sector by half, (the current intervention price will be maintained);  reforms in the rice, durum wheat, nuts, starch potatoes and dried fodder sectors. The Commission press release provides a detailed summary of how the various reforms will be implemented. This includes an outline of the modifications made to the Commission's original proposals with regard to the single farm payment scheme, where member states can be allowed to maintain up to 25 % of current hectare payments in the arable sector linked to production if this maintains land in production. Alternatively 40 % of the supplementary durum wheat premium may continue to be linked to production. Unlike the Commission's initial proposal there will be no reduction in <b>cereals</b> <b>intervention</b> prices, although the existing seasonal correction payments will be reduced by 50 %. A supplement for durum wheat in traditional durum wheat farming areas will be paid independently of production for which member states may decide to retain 40 % linked to production. A quality premium for durum wheat used in pasta and semolina production to farmers in traditional zones will also be paid. A one-step reduction in the price of rice of 50 % was agreed. This will bring the EU price (€ 150 /tonne) into line with the world market price. Current direct aid payments will be increased from € 25 /tonne to € 177 /tonne. Of this € 102 /tonne {{will be part of the}} single farm aid payment, based on historical rights, while the remainder (€ 75 /tonne) will be paid as a crop-specific aid. Intervention buying will be triggered should market prices fall to € 150 per tonne, with a ceiling of 75, 000 tonnes being set for intervention buying. New tariff items are to be created to accommodate the new rice regime. With regard to the beef sector, member states may decide to retain up to a 100 % of the suckler cow premium and over 40 % of the slaughter premium as a production-linked payment, or 100 % of the slaughter premium or 75 % of the special male premium. In addition for sheep and goats, a maximum of 50 % of the premium can remain linked to production, while drying aid for cereals in the outermost regions of the EU may remain linked to production. The dairy sector will only be incorporated into the single farm payment from 2008 when the process of reform has been fully implemented. The reformed dairy quota regime will remain in place until 2014 / 15. The intervention prices for butter will decrease by 25 % over four years which is an additional price cut of 10 % compared to those agreed in 2000. There will be a reduction in skimmed milk powder prices of 15 % over three years in line with the Agenda 2000 agreement. Intervention buying for butter will be suspended above a limit of 70, 000 tonnes in 2004, with this declining to 30, 000 tonnes by 2007. Compensation payments will rise from € 11. 81 per tonne in 2004 to € 23. 65 in 2005 and € 35. 5 per tonne in 2006. In addition member states may make additional payments equivalent to 10 % of the sum of the single farm aid payment to encourage specific types of farming. With regard to funds generated by 'modulation' (that is the progressive reduction of payments to larger farms) 1 % will remain in the member states where the money is raised. The remainder will be allocated to member states according to: agricultural area; agricultural employment; GDP per capita, purchasing power. This being said every member state will receive at least 80 % of the funds generated from modulation in its territory. Proposals for reform of the olive oil, tobacco and cotton regimes will be tabled in autumn 2003. Comment: The prior implementation of reform in the dairy sector, involving substantial price reductions, in advance of incorporation into the single farm payment scheme, gives an indication of the likely trajectory for reform in the sugar sector, a sector of vital importance to a number of ACP economies. The impact this will have on the value of ACP sugar preferences (quite independent of the outcome of the Brazilian and Australian WTO challenge to the EU's 'C' export arrangements) will need to be taken into account in the on-going EPA negotiations; possibly through the negotiation of 'compensatory trade measures' explicitly linked to the erosion of the value of trade preferences as a result of the implementation of CAP reform. In the rice sector the compromise reform includes a specific reference to traditional rice suppliers stating 'the Commission will also take into account the interests of developing countries, including those traditional suppliers, as well as the implementation of the EBA regulation', it remains to be seen what this will mean in practice for traditional ACP suppliers such as Surinam and Guyana. The major change with regard to modulation which keeps the vast majority of these funds for deployment in support of rural development means that there will be little scope created for the financing of further reform. This could serve to defer substantive reform of the EU sugar regime. In {{the words of}} the European Commission, the June 26 th 2003 agreement on CAP [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In July Commissioner Fischler {{undertook}} a whistle stop tour of seven EU countries in ten days {{in order to}} explain the CAP mid-term review proposals. Opening the tour in Holland Mr Fischler maintained that the EU's agricultural policy was 'doomed to fail' if farmers simply limited themselves {{to the production of}} commodities. He maintained that the question is 'not if, but how we support our farmers. The mid-term review is the answer to filling the gaps between our objectives and our achievements'. On the question of subsidies he maintained that the Commission wants to create a system where farmers 'make management decisions {{on the basis of the}} demands of the market and expectations of society, rather than the value of the subsidy'. This, he maintained, was the logic behind de-coupling payments from production. He highlighted how the proposed reforms were based on three elements: adaptation in some market sectors; separating direct payments from production; and shifting more money to rural development Speaking in France Mr Fischler chose to highlight the Commission's concern to 'safeguard the direct payments to farmers better and to make them more acceptable both at home and in the WTO'. Specifically the Commission is proposing that in future farmers will get their direct income-payment without having to produce cereals or beef. They must however produce the public goods demanded by society, such as preservation of the countryside and the environment in a satisfactory way. He argued that 'this de-coupling means not only an enormous simplification of administration, but also that the aid does not create any incentive for production which may bypass the market and ruin the agricultural policy's reputation'. In both France and Italy the Commissioner emphasised that small farms would be excluded completely from 'dynamic modulation', which would see a progressive reduction in direct payments and the introduction of a cap on spending per farm. He stressed that the Commission's proposals were aimed at letting French cereal farmers take advantage of the positive developments on the world market. He pointed out that 'with the existing system this is possible only to a limited extent. Firstly the EU's import duty system is inadequate, which has hit French producers particularly hard because of massive cheap imports from the Black Sea region. Secondly there are considerable uncertainties on account of big price fluctuations and exchange rate movements between the euro and the dollar, which could affect our farmers export opportunities substantially'. Against this background a further 5 % reduction in the <b>intervention</b> price for <b>cereals</b> is designed to make it easier for products to be sold on world markets, while farm incomes would be protected by increased direct aid payments. Speaking in the UK, Commissioner Fischler defended the proposal to 'cap' EU aid per farm at € 300, 000, arguing that this was justified on the grounds that large farms are able to benefit from economies of scale. He pointed out that under the current system 'direct payments have not necessarily arrived where they are most needed, given that 80 % of the payments went to 20 % of farms'. In the UK, he also stressed that abolishing the CAP was simply not on the EU's agenda. He maintained that the new system would not distort trade, with all the negative impact this had on developing countries. This aspect would, he argued, strengthen the EU's negotiating position in the Doha Development Round. This point was also taken up in his presentation in Denmark, where he noted how important it is to have a competitive farm sector, given Denmark's € 5 billion surplus in the agricultural and processed-food product sector. He emphasised that CAP reform would free Danish farmers from tedious paper work and allow them to return to being businessmen producing for their customers and exporting quality products, rather than producing for intervention. Speaking in Finland Mr Fischler rejected claims that the Commission wanted to cut the farm budget, asserting 'we want to maintain the level of support for the farming sector', with the mid-term review being aimed at 'spending the money in a more sensible and efficient manner'. He stressed that 'our intention is to keep farmers in business, to give them a payment decoupled from production to stabilise their incomes', and that 'more money will be available to support farmers who have to work under difficult climatic conditions, as is the case in the many less favoured areas of Finland'. He stressed how in the Finnish context a reinforced rural-development policy would mean more support in less-favoured areas and for agri-environmental schemes which are currently underfunded in Finland. Finally he pointed out that not a single Finnish farmer would be affected by the € 300, 000 'cap' on subsidies per farm. In Italy Mr Fischler reiterated that the Commission wanted to 'continue to guarantee Italian farmers a fair income 'and that the Commission proposals 'do not change this one iota'. He emphasised that the current proposals do not change the financial commitments made up to 2006, but were primarily aimed at ending production purely for intervention. A reformed CAP would help Italian farmers to meet higher production standards attracting higher prices. Speaking in Germany he highlighted the importance of meeting consumer expectations through de-coupling direct payments from production and making them conditional on compliance with environmental, food-safety and animal-welfare standards. He pointed out how farmers' efforts to protect the environment and ensure high quality, safe food were not generally rewarded via the market and that the costs of providing these public goods should be rewarded directly via the CAP budget. With regard to 'capping' individual farm subsidies he maintained that there could be no economic justification for large farms receiving over € 1 million a year in subsidies. He sought to calm fear in the former East German territories over the impact of 'capping' on large labour-intensive units, by pointing out that such units would receive an allowance of € 3, 000 per employee, which would provide additional financial benefits to such farms. A common theme in all countries was the public demand for healthier, safer and higher quality food produced on a sustainable basis. In this context the twin aims of CAP reform were the de-coupling of production from direct aid-payments and the linking of direct aid-payments to compliance with environmental, food safety, animal welfare and occupational safety. Speaking in Austria on September 2 nd in an on-going effort to sell the mid-term review proposals, Commissioner Fischler argued that the reforms were in the basic interests of Austrian farmers. Two-thirds of them would be unaffected by the 'dynamic modulation' proposals, while overall they would actually receive more money under the reformed CAP as a consequence of increased expenditures on rural development. He warned farmers against rejecting the proposals, as this might alienate consumers and taxpayers, and reiterated that the Commission was not setting out to reduce the agricultural budget but simply to spend it more rationally. He pointed out that the proposals would make more transparent payments to farmers for the provision of 'public goods', such as environmental protection. This he maintained would give farmers greater income stability. Comment: Commissioner Fischler's assertion that the new system will not distort trade is open to dispute. While de-coupling will reduce the incentive for production for intervention stocks, it is still likely to provide an incentive to produce until international market prices fall below the marginal cost of producing, processing and marketing an additional unit of the product internationally. With de-coupled direct aid payments shifting the supply curve of farmers so that at any given price level they are willing to produce a higher volume of product than would be the case in the absence of such direct aid payments, this factor may serve to undermine world market prices of a range of agricultural products. In southern Africa there are already reports of French traders selling wheat at prices 20 % below the current world market price. Mr Fischler's emphasis on how financial commitments up to 2006 will not be affected by the mid-term review proposals suggests that the main aim of the current proposals is to 'fly a kite' to ascertain the nature and intensity of member states' resistance to the proposed changes. This will then enable the Commission to develop acceptable proposals which continue to move the process of CAP reform in the direction of across the board payments to farmers which are de-coupled from production decisions and hence more WTO compatible. The current furore in various EU member states over the Commission's mid-term review proposals needs to be seen against this background, with its influence likely to be more on the timing and precise modalities of reform proposals rather than on the overall direction of change.
