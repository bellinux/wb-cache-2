50|$|Peck {{was hired}} as a deck boy in 1935, and he joined in a work strike on a boat for better food during his first voyage. In September 1935, Peck was on a boat that {{anchored}} in Pensacola, Florida, where Peck joined the longshoremen who were on strike. Peck claimed the union hall was fully integrated at the time by the striking longshoremen. Peck remained there for two weeks before police arrested him for distributing rank-and-file literature on a boat, marking his first arrest. In the labor movement in the 1930s he helped found what later became the National Maritime Union. Joseph Curran led a strike aboard a ship in March 1936, anchored in NYC. Peck picketed with the longshoremen {{for the first time on}} March 22, 1936. He then picketed again from November 1936 to January 1937. Curran led the fight against Joe Ryan. This led to the formation of the NMU, the strongest east coast longshoremen union. Peck would later criticize Joseph Curran's transformation once in power of the NMU. On May 11, 1936, Peck was arrested for the second time in his life. Police clashed with striking seamen that day, with Peck being beaten and arrested. This marked Peck's first mass arrest, as one of 221 strikers arrested that day. That night they were arraigned, making it the largest group every arraigned at the same time <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>courtroom.</b>|$|E
40|$|I {{conceive}} my role at this gathering {{to be that}} of {{a talking}} fish. Let me explain. The great twentieth-century appellate lawyer, John W. Davis, was once asked to give a speech about oral advocacy. He did so, while observing that it was a bit like asking a fisherman to describe how to reel in a fish; wouldn 2 ̆ 7 t it be more pertinent, Davis inquired, to ask the fish for his reflections? That is, 2 ̆ 2 if the fish himself could be induced to give his views on the most effective methods of approach. 2 ̆ 2 Davis 2 ̆ 7 s literary conceit can be extended a bit to think of this Symposium as a meeting of marine biologists discussing aquariums, their decoration, their placement, their contents, and their future, if any. As an inhabitant of such a venue, I am easily induced to offer views even while my species is dissected and my habitat is explored. There is, it bears emphasizing, a broader ecosystem beyond the courthouse/aquarium - the larger political community that those in the aquarium purport to serve while those in the academy engage in observation - which provides the relevant context. The confluence of court and community may usefully be approached through what I consider the iconic image of the American courthouse in the formative period of our legal and political history: it is the painting of Patrick Henry in the Hanover County Courthouse arguing the Parson 2 ̆ 7 s Cause, which raised in 1763 the question whether and how the citizens of Virginia should compensate the Anglican clergy. The entire political community is on hand to observe and to participate. Of course, that political community was constricted; you will search in vain for the face of either a woman or an African American in the painting. Nevertheless, with those fundamental limitations to the polity of the American Eden acknowledged, it is evident that the observant and participatory community fills the courtroom and extends outside the courthouse door toward the tavern beyond, where, as Justice Robert H. Jackson once observed, lawyers and their clients traditionally retire to celebrate the 2 ̆ 2 last rites 2 ̆ 2 for court proceedings. There is historical symmetry in the fact that slightly more than two centuries later, this little courtroom also played a supporting {{role in the development of}} the constitutional doctrine - as opposed to the customary practice-of judicial transparency. A conviction imposed after a closed murder trial conducted <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>courtroom</b> became the vehicle by which the Supreme Court, in 1980, established a First Amendment right of press and public to attend criminal trials...|$|E

40|$|International {{humanitarian}} law and {{international criminal law}} are distinct but related fields. The application of international {{humanitarian law}} to concrete facts by international tribunals and courts {{has contributed to the}} development and clarification of this body of law. However, using a law <b>in</b> the <b>courtroom</b> <b>that</b> was created instead, to be applied on the battlefield poses significant challenges. In the process of such use, the law may have been distorted to fit facts that it was not envisioned to cover. Its use is as a means to punish unwanted behaviour during armed conflicts and to combat impunity risks contorting the balance on which international humanitarian law is based: military necessity and humanity. This chapter highlights some findings by international criminal tribunals and courts that do not sit easily with international humanitarian law as applied by armed forces, and discusses the consequences that applying the laws of armed conflict during criminal trials may have for this branch of international law...|$|R

Meanwhile, his father gets a job in Ohio and the family has to move. At his trial the assault charges are dropped and he is charged only with drunk driving and operating without a license.

2500|$|The {{first trial}} of {{defendants}} McGeehan, Carroll, Duffy, James Boyle, and James Roarity {{for the killing}} of Yost commenced in May 1876. Yost had not recognized the men who attacked him. Although Kerrigan has since been described, along with Duffy, as hating the night watchman enough to plot his murder, Kerrigan became a state's witness and testified against the union leaders and other miners. However, Kerrigan's wife testified <b>in</b> the <b>courtroom</b> <b>that</b> her husband had committed the murder.

She stated that she was speaking out voluntarily, and was only interested in telling the truth about the murder. Gowen cross-examined her, but could not shake her testimony.

40|$|Stealing thunder is a {{technique}} used <b>in</b> the <b>courtroom</b> <b>that</b> involves the defendant revealing self-incriminating negative information (2 ̆ 2 thunder 2 ̆ 2) before it is revealed by the prosecution {{in order to reduce}} its potential negative impact on the jury (Williams, Bourgeois, 2 ̆ 6 Croyle, 1993). The goal of the present research was to examine if stealing thunder would be useful in understanding relationship processes and address mechanisms that could account for its effectiveness. I examined whether stealing thunder with one 2 ̆ 7 s HIV+ status could affect an individual 2 ̆ 7 s dating potential. Responding to an online survey, 657 gay males read two online profiles, one written by an HIV+ romantic prospect (Alex) and one written by Alex 2 ̆ 7 s friend. Participants were randomly assigned to revealer (i. e., who revealed HIV+ status: target, friend, both, or neither) and which profile (Alex 2 ̆ 7 s or Alex 2 ̆ 7 s friend) they read first. Results indicated that among participants reading the Alex-written profile first, stealing thunder diminished the negative impact of his HIV+ status, resulting in a greater willingness to date and the effect was mediated by Alex 2 ̆ 7 s perceived honesty and credibility. These results support the honesty mechanism, while also contributing a real-world strategy for HIV+ males in meeting potential partners. Implications for theory and policy are discussed. ...|$|R
