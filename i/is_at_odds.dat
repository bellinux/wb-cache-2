5|$|The abortion–breast cancer {{hypothesis}} {{posits that}} having an induced abortion {{can increase the}} risk of getting breast cancer. This hypothesis <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> with mainstream scientific opinion and is contradicted by major medical professional organizations. In early pregnancy, hormone levels increase, leading to breast growth. The hypothesis proposes that if this process is interrupted by an abortion then more immature cells could be left behind, resulting in a greater potential risk of breast cancer over time.|$|E
5|$|The {{synopsis}} <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> {{with the}} reviewers {{of the film}} who state that the arrow which reveals the hidden cache is shot by the little boy and not the mother. The image still shows the woman with a large bow, but further details by the reviewers state that the boy used a toy bow and arrow to make the shot.|$|E
5|$|Egyptologists {{have noted}} that instead of hiding their non-royal origins, Neferhotep I, his {{predecessor}} Sobekhotep III, and his successor Sobekhotep IV, remarkably proclaimed them on their stelae and scarab seals. This <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> with the traditional Egyptian system where {{the legitimacy of the}} new king rests mainly on his filiation. These proclamations of non-royal origins were possibly made to dissociate these kings from their immediate predecessors, in particular Seth Meribre whose monuments have been usurped and defaced. The reason for this remains unknown.|$|E

50|$|Following {{an active}} 13th century, and after their move south the O'Donovans of Ui Chairbre fall into {{relative}} obscurity for approximately two centuries, primarily because the records for Munster {{during this period}} are few. Fragmenting into several smaller-sized lordships, they became subordinate to their overlord, MacCarthy Reagh, who <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> with the MacCarthy Mor, who <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> with the MacCarthys of Muscrery, who <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> with both the Norman settlers (Barrys) and the old Irish (O'Callahan, O'Keefe), and with Gaelicized English (Fitzgeralds- Earls of Desmonds, FitzGibbons - Earls of Kildare and the White Knight), {{all of whom were}} or were not, depending on changing politics, <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> with the English monarchs.|$|R
5|$|Naota later finds Haruko {{working in}} his house as a live-in maid. It is later {{discovered}} that Haruko is an investigator for the Galactic Space Police Brotherhood. Haruko uses Naota for her search for the Pirate King, Atomsk. She <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> with Medical Mechanica, a monolithic industrial corporation. Naota is being watched by Commander Amarao, a special agent of the Bureau of Interstellar Immigration, who believes that Medical Mechanica is out to conquer the galaxy. Naota is ultimately drawn into a three-way battle between Haruko, Amarao and Medical Mechanica.|$|E
5|$|Several {{groups of}} {{characters}} serve as Felix's antagonists in The Lost Age. He <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> with {{the heroes of}} the original Golden Sun, led by the young Venus Adept warrior Isaac, who pursue him across the World, Weyard under the belief that Alchemy would potentially destroy Weyard if unleashed. One of Saturos' original companions, a powerful and enigmatic Mercury Adept named Alex, allies himself with a second pair of powerful and imposing Mars Adept warriors, Karst and Agatio. They {{keep the pressure on}} Felix to ensure he proceeds with his quest as he is supposed to.|$|E
5|$|The {{elements}} in group 12 are usually {{considered to be}} d-block elements, but not transition elements as the d-shell is full. Some authors classify these elements as main-group elements because the valence electrons are in ns2 orbitals. Nevertheless, they share many characteristics with the neighboring group 11 elements on the periodic table, which are almost universally considered to be transition elements. For example, zinc shares many characteristics with the neighboring transition metal, copper. Zinc complexes merit inclusion in the Irving-Williams series as zinc forms many complexes with the same stoichiometry as complexes of copper(II), albeit with smaller stability constants. There is little similarity between cadmium and silver as compounds of silver(II) are rare {{and those that do}} exist are very strong oxidizing agents. Likewise the common oxidation state for gold is +3, which precludes there being much common chemistry between mercury and gold, though there are similarities between mercury(I) and gold(I) such as the formation of linear dicyano complexes, −. According to IUPAC's definition of transition metal as an element whose atom has an incomplete d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub-shell, zinc and cadmium are not transition metals, while mercury is. This is because only mercury is known to have a compound where its oxidation state is higher than +2, in mercury(IV) fluoride (though its existence is disputed, as later experiments trying to confirm its synthesis could not find evidence of HgF4). However, this classification is based on one highly atypical compound seen at non-equilibrium conditions and <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> to mercury's more typical chemistry, and Jensen has suggested {{that it would be better}} to regard mercury as not being a transition metal.|$|E
50|$|Several {{features}} of the DIR approach <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> with more conventional forms of diver training.|$|R

25|$|The slick, bold style – {{driven by}} digital {{animation}} software – <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> with the somewhat rustic {{quality of the}} old musical recordings but allows close synchronisation with the vocals. The smooth, repetitive, side-scrolling movement it effects assists in suspending the musical episode from the more consistent narrative plot.|$|E

5000|$|While this fictional {{company has}} {{encountered}} numerous superheroes, it has most notably <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> with Iron Man, as in a storyline called [...] "The Iron Age" [...] {{where it was}} revealed that agents of Roxxon Oil (then known as Republic Oil and Gas) killed Tony Stark's parents. Roxxon has also regularly <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> with Project Pegasus regarding energy sources as the latter has been involved with alternative energy research that could hurt Roxxon's oil profitability.|$|R
25|$|Zach Roerig as Matt Donovan, Elena's {{childhood}} friend and ex-boyfriend, who became romantically involved with Caroline in season 1. They remain good friends even after breaking {{up during the}} third season. Matt wants no part in the supernatural events in his town and later <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> with the vampires as he becomes a police officer and tries to protect the town from them.|$|E
25|$|In January 2017, Budi Waseso, {{the chief}} of Indonesia's {{national}} narcotics agency, said that the pilot of Lion Air Flight 904 was {{under the influence of}} drugs {{at the time of the}} accident, and had hallucinated that the sea was part of the runway. That claim <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> with the statement made after the accident by Indonesia's transport ministry, which said the pilots had not tested positive for drugs.|$|E
25|$|At the European {{elections}} in 1999, he re-entered French politics {{as the leader}} of the French Green Party (Les Verts) list. He found considerable support in the French media, who often feature him, even when he does not represent or <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> with the party. He reached 9.72% of votes, a score since then unequalled by the French Greens until 2009 (16.28% of the votes), where he was the Green leader again.|$|E

Glenn and Tara {{struggle}} on the way to Terminus, with their main objective to find Glenn's wife, Maggie Greene. Meanwhile, after Beth's mysterious disappearance, Daryl Dixon now has joined the group of Claimers led by Joe (Jeff Kober) but <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> with some of its members.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary {{construction}} {{on college campuses}} is diverse, with construction mirroring and diverging from earlier styles and trends. Examples of deliberately referential or contextual architecture include Whitman College, at Princeton. Designed by Demetri Porphyrios, the college was built to resemble earlier {{construction on}} the campus in the Collegiate Gothic style, examples of which include Mathey and Rockefeller Colleges. This construction <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> with other recently added buildings, such as the Lewis Science Library, by architect Frank Gehry, which is Deconstructivist in its design, and neighboring Butler College, partially drafted by postmodern architect Robert Venturi.|$|E
25|$|The terms 'First Age of the Sun' and 'Ages of the Sun' are {{commonly}} used by many fans, but do not appear anywhere in Tolkien's writings. The 'First Age of the Sun' in this conception is held {{to begin with the}} first rising of the Sun and continue until Morgoth's defeat nearly 600 years later. While this <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> with Tolkien's statements that the First Age was the longest by far it is a common misapprehension because the subsequent ages all took place entirely during the Years of the Sun.|$|E

25|$|Another example where visual {{appearance}} <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> with measurement {{comes from}} the observation of apparent superluminal motion in various radio galaxies, BL Lac objects, quasars, and other astronomical objects that eject relativistic-speed jets of matter at narrow angles {{with respect to the}} viewer. An optical illusion results giving the appearance of faster than light travel. In Fig.1‑14, galaxy M87 streams out a high-speed jet of subatomic particles almost directly towards us, but Penrose–Terrell rotation causes the jet to appear to be moving laterally in the same manner that the appearance of the cube in Fig.1‑13 has been stretched out.|$|E
25|$|Some Canadian {{polls have}} {{referred}} in their questions to British monarchy or called the British monarch Canada's head of state. This terminology <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> with the contemporary situation in Canada, wherein the monarchy is a Canadian institution separate {{from that of}} the United Kingdom, being called the Canadian Crown and Canadian monarchy by the government and constitutional scholars, and the monarch is uniquely titled as Queen of Canada. The government of Saskatchewan has stated it is incorrect to denote the Canadian Royal Family as the British Royal Family. Additionally, the Queen of Canada is considered Canadian.|$|E
25|$|Others, however, view him {{not as a}} builder, {{but rather}} as a conqueror. He was of Albanian origin rather than Egyptian, and {{throughout}} his reign, Turkish was the official language of his court rather than Arabic. Some argue that he exploited Egyptian manpower and resources for his own personal ends, not Egyptian national ones, with the manpower requirements that he placed on Egyptians being particularly onerous. Taken together in this light, Muhammad Ali is cast by some as another {{in a long line of}} foreign conquerors dating back to the Persian occupation in 525B.C. This view, however, <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> with the majority opinion of Egyptian, and other Arab historians, and Egyptian public opinion.|$|E
