The estate was originally planned to contain over 750 prefabricated houses. While planning for the estate began in 1949, main construction occurred between 1951 and 1962.|$|E

25|$|Houses are {{a mixture}} of low scale {{dwellings}} set in gardens. The streetscape is generally open due to the low horizontal building forms and low or open style fencing. Buildings and homes are predominantly 1960s-1970s <b>Housing</b> <b>Commission</b> of Victoria homes made of conite, fibro rendering with some contemporary styling added by the renovation. Sealed roads have kerbs and footpaths {{on both sides of}} the street. Trees are medium to large and planted irregularly in streets. The approximate size of Frankston North is 5.2km2.|$|E
25|$|In the interwar and post-World War II years, heavy {{industry}} continued to establish {{itself in the}} flatter northern suburbs, where today industries such as the Shell oil refinery and Ford Motor Company engine plant reside. Residential development also spread to Corio and Norlane in the north, with new <b>Housing</b> <b>Commission</b> of Victoria estates built to cater for employees of the new industries. From the 1960s, residential growth spread to the Highton hills {{in the south and}} North Geelong following prosperous industries like the gasworks, followed by Grovedale in the 1970s. A number of light industrial areas were also established in Breakwater, Moolap, and South Geelong.|$|E
25|$|To {{counter the}} trend towards low-density {{suburban}} residential growth, {{the government began}} a series of controversial public housing projects in the inner city by the <b>Housing</b> <b>Commission</b> of Victoria, which resulted in demolition of many neighbourhoods and a proliferation of high-rise towers. In later years, with the rapid rise of motor vehicle ownership, the investment in freeway and highway developments greatly accelerated the outward suburban sprawl and declining inner city population. The Bolte government sought to rapidly accelerate the modernisation of Melbourne. Major road projects including the remodelling of St Kilda Junction, the widening of Hoddle Street and then the extensive 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan changed the face of the city into a car-dominated environment.|$|E

25|$|The {{strength}} of the club's ties {{can be traced to}} its origins. The Club was formed in 1964, not long after the establishment of a <b>housing</b> <b>commission</b> estate in Pines Forest/Frankston North. The club experienced several lean years in which it struggled to win a game before local juniors began graduating into the senior team. In fact in its early years it was the junior sides that helped establish the club's success. In 1967, the club's under 12 team was the first side to represent the Pines Football club in a grand final. As young players graduated through its ranks the football club began winning premierships in all competition levels including 3 consecutive flags between 1968 and 1970 via its under-15 side.|$|E
25|$|On 17 April 1946, Wagga Wagga was proclaimed a {{city and}} Wagga Wagga grew {{steadily}} after the war. Suburbs such as Turvey Park, Mount Austin and Kooringal were developed including over 1,200 <b>Housing</b> <b>Commission</b> homes. In the 1960s, residential growth expanded to cover areas such as Tolland and Lake Albert. As the suburban sprawl moved south, the main commercial district also moved south to the Baylis Street end, including developments such as the Sturt Mall, built in 1979 while {{the northern end of}} the central business district slowly became deserted. To promote the development of additional secondary industry in Wagga Wagga, the City Council developed a series of industrial areas including areas for service and general industries, and agricultural processing and noxious industries were established in a new industrial estate in Bomen.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, {{concern about the}} growth of land prices in the Perth {{metropolitan}} area, which for several years had exceeded the consumer price index, led to the Premier of Western Australia, David Brand, convening an inter-departmental committee to study the problem. One of the committee's recommendations to Cabinet was to release 300 hectares of land owned by the State <b>Housing</b> <b>Commission</b> in Hamersley, Warwick and Greenwood which was on a much larger area that had been designated as [...] "deferred urban" [...] land under the Metropolitan Region Scheme in 1963. On 13 December 1967, the Metropolitan Region Planning Authority decided to rezone as urban all land bounded by Hepburn Avenue, Marmion Avenue, North Perimeter Highway and Wanneroo Road, {{on the condition that}} subdivision would be approved when [...] "Town Planning (Development) Scheme(s) have been approved with the general object of serving the best possible development at the least cost to the community".|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, {{work was}} only {{starting}} in eastern Hamersley. In 1973 Project Homes acquired a poultry farm and agricultural holding, and completed {{the construction of}} Vickers Street and adjoining roads, with Don Place becoming a display village. In 1974 the City of Stirling agreed, after complex negotiations, to sell 4.2hectares of land comprising Carine Road and Allen Street to the State <b>Housing</b> <b>Commission</b> and to War Service Homes in order to [...] "facilitate a satisfactory subdivisional design of adjoining land held by the State Housing Commission" [...] in the eastern portion of the suburb. All that remains of these two early roads are paved pathways within the Rannoch-Tay-Earn Reserve, which was gazetted in 1976. By July 1975, 200 defence service homes were under construction on land immediately {{to the east of}} Erindale Road, to be made available to veterans from March 1976. The rest of eastern Hamersley was built over the next few years, and by 1981 development was essentially complete. The community hall was redeveloped into a full-fledged community centre, which officially opened in 1990.|$|E
500|$|Northern Hamersley, meanwhile, {{became part}} of Swan Location 1315, which {{extended}} north to Lake Goollelal and west to the coast and was granted in the 1890s to the Midland Railway Company after being surveyed by Crossland & Co. in 1892, and by N. Lymburner in 1894.* Crossland & Co. (1892). Loc. 1315 Western Survey for Midland Railway Co. [...] Later additions to 1900. Scale: 20 chains to 1 inch; approx. 1:16,000.

Scale: 15 chains to 1inch; approx. 1:12,000. Accessed at State Records Office, Perth, under [...] "Swan 270". It appears that no development occurred in northern Hamersley, other than the construction of Beach and Carine Roads in 1900, and the State <b>Housing</b> <b>Commission</b> resumed the land in November 1950. In 1962, a lucerne grower with a property on Duffy Road, Carine applied to use the northern half of the suburb as a sheep run. The Shire President, Herbert R. Robinson, refused to grant permission, saying that [...] "land might soon be needed for housing". The West Australian reported in 1967 that the area was still [...] "virtually untouched bushland".|$|E
500|$|Leigh Leigh, born Leigh Rennea Mears on 24 July 1975, was the {{daughter}} of Robyn Lynne Maunsell and Robert William Mears. Leigh's grandmother said that Leigh lived with her between the ages of about four and seven, though she did not disclose reasons for this living arrangement. Leigh's parents divorced when she was about seven years old. She moved back to live with her mother after her sister Jessie was born in 1983; her surname was subsequently changed to Leigh as this was the surname of her sister's father. At the time of her death she lived with her sister, mother and stepfather Brad Shearman on Fullerton Road, Fern Bay, having moved there nine months earlier from a <b>housing</b> <b>commission</b> flat near the Stockton ferry terminal. Leigh was a Year Eight student at Newcastle High School who enjoyed school, according to her grandmother. She had attended three primary schools successively: St Patrick's in Swansea, Hamilton North Public School, and St Peter's in Stockton. Leigh spent most of her weekends and school holidays with her grandmother at her house in Kilaben Bay. Her cousin and best friend Tracey stated she and Leigh enjoyed going to the cinema together, as well as roller-skating and [...] "just hanging about". According to her aunt, Leigh had wanted to be a veterinarian. Both Leigh's mother and her grandmother described her as a [...] "typical teenager".|$|E
