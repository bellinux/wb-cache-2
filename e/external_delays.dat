40|$|AbstractAn {{existing}} agent-based simulation {{framework and}} congestion pricing methodology is extended towards a consistent consideration of non-linear, user- and trip-specific values of travel time savings (VTTS). The heterogeneous VTTS are inherent {{to the model}} and result from each agent's individual time pressure. An innovative approach is presented which accounts for the non-linear, user- and trip-specific VTTS (i) when converting <b>external</b> <b>delays</b> into congestion tolls and (ii) when generating new transport routes. The innovative pricing and routing methodology is applied to a real-world case study of the Greater Berlin area, Germany. The proposed methodology performs better than assuming a constant value of travel time savings or randomizing the routing relevant costs. The improved consistency of setting congestion toll levels, identifying transport routes and evaluating travel plans is found {{to result in a}} higher system welfare...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To report care {{pathways}} {{of tuberculosis}} (TB) patients under the integrated model, where TB clinical service {{is provided by}} a general hospital instead of the TB dispensary, {{with the aim of}} providing policy recommendations for TB care reforms in China. Methods: Six counties implementing the integrated model were randomly selected, and 50 TB patients in each county participated in a questionnaire survey. Results: Of the 301 participants, 82 visited only the TB designated hospital. A patient visited a median of two health providers in total. The median external provider delay and internal provider delay were 1 and 0 day, respectively. The median out-of-pocket medical costs were US$ 379 in total; US$ 293 in the TB units and US$ 0 in other health units in the TB designated hospital. Logistic regression analyses suggested that patients who visited the primary care facilities first tended to have longer <b>external</b> <b>delays</b> (OR = 5. 71) than patients who visited the other hospitals (OR = 10. 16). Conclusion: The integrated model is promising as it reported relatively fewer patient pathways and shorter delays than the dispensary model.

40|$|Thresholds were {{measured}} for diotic tonal signals {{in the presence}} of interaurally delayed bands of Gaussian noise. When the signal frequency was 525 Hz, the spectrum of the noise was either below (highest frequency, 450 Hz) or above (lowest frequency, 600 Hz) the frequency of the signal. When the signal frequency was 450 Hz, the spectrum of the noise was always above the signal frequency (lowest frequency, 600 Hz). Signals had a 250 -ms duration and were temporally centered within the 300 -ms long bursts of noise. The spectrum level of the noise was 60 dB. Thresholds obtained in all three conditions varied essentially sinusoidally with the interaural delay of the noise. For signals below the spectrum of the noise, the periodicities within the data were close to, but not identical with, the periodicities of the signals. This outcome is discussed in terms of masking produced by aural distortion products stemming from interactions within the bands of noise [cf. van der Heijden and Kohlrausch, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 98, 3125 – 3134 (1995) ]. For signals above the spectrum of the noise, the periodicities in the data suggested that masking was produced by components within the band of noise.

40|$|Motion and {{position}} information interact within the visual cortex {{in such a}} way that creates the perception that a stimulus is shifted in position. This displacement in position is referred to as a motion induced position shift. Multiple theories have attempted to explain the underlying mechanisms of these perceived shifts in motion stimuli. One of the dominant theories suggests that the position of motion stimuli is extrapolated forward in an attempt to compensate for the internal and <b>external</b> <b>delays</b> in processing. An alternative theory suggests that there is a simple cell summation at all sides of a motion stimulus, however it is selectively reduced at the trailing edges. Thus, an inhibitory process selectively occurs for signals that trail motion rather than advance on it. The current project aims to tease apart these theories by examining the relationship between sensitivity at the leading and trailing edges of a drifting grating and the magnitude of the perceived motion induced shift. Experiment 1 attempted to confirm this relationship within both first and second order motion stimuli. Results revealed that there was a negative correlation between sensitivity at the trailing edge and the magnitude of illusory shift. Experiment 2 attempted to replicate these findings using a standardised measure of the magnitude of illusory shift. The results consistently revealed that sensitivity was selectively reduced at the trailing edge relative to the leading edge. However, no relationship was found between sensitivity and the magnitude of illusory shifts. Thus, the results revealed inconclusive findings concerning the relationship between sensitivity at the leading and trailing edges and the magnitude of the illusory shifts...|$|E

Two reasons are mainly responsible for that: variations of the PMT transit time and different rise times of the analogue input signal at the CFD. However, these different rise times can be compensated partly by using the constant fraction technology.

Various strategies have been used to counteract the delay effect. Thus, the tuning of PID controllers is perhaps the most widely used. In [3 – 6], different tuning rules for stable/unstable systems with delay can be found. The disadvantage of such techniques is that they only work well, when the delay is small compared with the time constant of the system [7].|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: leaves 132 - 138. This study {{investigates the}} {{modelling}} of adative routing algorithms with specific {{reference to the}} algorithm of an existing Wide Area Network (WAN). Packets in the network are routed at each node {{on the basis of}} routing tables which contain internal and <b>external</b> <b>delays</b> for each route from the node. The internal delay on a route represents the time that packets queued for transmission will have to wait before being transmitted, while the external delay on a route represents the delay to other nodes via that route. Several modelling methods are investigated and compared for the purpose of identifying the most appropriate and applicable technique. A model of routing in the WAN using an analytic technique is described. The hypothesis {{of this study is that}} dynamic routing can be modelled as a sequence of models exhibiting fixed routing. The modelling rationale is that a series of analytic models is run and solved. The routing algorithm of the WAN studied is such that, if viewed at any time instant, the network is one with static routing and no buffer overflow. This characteristic, together with a real time modelling requirement, influences the modelling technique which is applied. Each model represents a routing update interval and a multiclass open queueing network is used to solve the model during a particular interval. Descriptions of the design and implementation of X wan, an X Window based modelling system, are provided. A feature of the modelling system is that it provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI), allowing interactive network specification and the direct observation of network routing through the medium of this interface. Various applications of the modelling system are presented, and overall network behaviour is examined. Experimentation with the routing algorithm is conducted, and (tentative) recommendations are made on ways in which network performance could be improved. A different routing algorithm is also implemented, for the purpose of comparison and to demonstrate the ease with which this can be affected...|$|E

The First Of A Kind (FOAKE) phenomenon alone might not explain such high cost increases. Delays are the upmost adverse event {{that can occur}} in the construction phase, due to the extra-cost that are engendered, and to the impairment of the whole project management. Initiator events of such delays in the realization schedule of new nuclear project may range from intrinsic to external factors. The former are more linked to the complexity level of the project itself: {{it seems like the}} project complexity of current large projects has escaped the control of project management, resulting in systematic construction time and cost overruns. <b>External</b> <b>delay</b> initiator events are more related to the intervention of external forces: e. g. a credit crunch, an adverse ruling by a civil court, extra reviews of the Safety Authority, etc. On account of these delays and related extra-costs, the economics and competitiveness of nuclear power is being heavily questioned. Such adverse conditions occur on large, GW-scale project. Small-Modular Reactors (SMR), like Gen III+ PWR, did not prove on the field, yet, their capacity to build “on time” and “on budget”. Nevertheless they are believed to have shorter lead times and present features able, in principle, to mitigate some construction risks. <b>External</b> <b>delay</b> events can hit in the same way large and small Nuclear Power Plants (NPP) and cause the same halt on the construction activity. Internal delay events should be mitigated by smaller design project, with layout simplifications and more standardized supply chain options.

40|$|Semiconductor lasers {{often make}} use of {{external}} optical feedback, for various reasons, like single-mode selection, stabilization or linewidth narrowing. A draw-back of such method is that delayed feedback can easily lead to sustained relaxation oscillations (RO). The occurrence of the RO is sensitive to, among other things, the applied settings of the phase of the feedback light. It is known from early studies that the onset of ROs already occurs with weak feedback. However, the onset of ROs is shifted to higher feedback strengths under resonance conditions, i. e. when the product of RO-frequency and <b>external</b> <b>delay</b> time equals an integer. This finding was based upon certain numerical and analytical considerations, but no simple explanation was given. From a theoretical analysis based on the Lang and Kobayashi equations, the existence of RO-free bias-current intervals of substantial width will be demonstrated for realistic pumping values, irrespective of the feedback phase. It will be shown that for conventional semiconductor lasers with weak optical feedback under RO-resonance condition the laser with feedback behaves as if no feedback is present. Therefore, under these conditions the RO is damped, hence will be suppressed. This result is valid in the regime of sufficiently weak feedback, such that the RO frequency is not deviating significantly from its value in the solitary laser and is supported by calculations of the RIN spectrum. © (2014) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).
