500|$|In June 2008, it was {{reported}} that Wellard was to be killed off. A show insider explained: [...] "Wellard has been a much-loved character and everyone will be sad to see him go. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it, Wellard was not a puppy when he arrived on Albert Square, so he would be over 100 in dog years by now. It makes sense for him to bow out of the show gracefully." [...] Raddings commented: [...] "I used to take Kyte on set everyday but I found the scenes when Wellard was put down too hard to watch so I asked someone else to take her to filming." [...] The scene in which Wellard was euthanised had to be re-edited, as Kyte could be seen breathing when supposedly dead. At the time of his death, Wellard had been in EastEnders for 14 years, making him one of the show's longest-running characters, and its longest-serving pet.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Superpower" [...] was {{directed}} by Jonas Åkerlund. It was filmed at the Hawthorne Plaza Shopping Center, a former shopping mall which was converted to a film set in Hawthorne, California. The singer was spotted by media on November 12, 2013 on the location set wearing a Louis Vuitton ski mask while filming the video. Beyoncé does not lip-sync or dance during the video. During an interview, she explained that [...] "Superpower" [...] was a song which [...] "you can just put on repeat and put you in this trance, which is why I didn't want to perform it in the video". With that being said, she wanted to focus on slow motion shots of [...] "really powerful imagery". It features former Destiny's Child members Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams as well as Pharrell Williams, Luke James and Les Twins. The director {{said that it was}} a [...] "spontaneous decision" [...] to include them in the video; Frank Ocean was also originally planned to appear. Åkerlund elaborated on the video: It's a very untraditional way of doing music videos, to not have her lip-synch. For Beyoncé, who's a dancer, it's very unusual to have a video without a dance part. I felt part of this idea for [...] "Superpower" [...] was to have stuff be in contrast to each other, so this song is very soft and very slow, but the action you see is aggressive and very big. We discussed it many times to see if we'd have the performance in the video or not. We decided no, and I think it works really, really well. It's kind of like a brave move, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it. Most artists can act and have all these different things, but they'll still fall back on the performance.|$|E

2500|$|Ólafur Arnalds won a British Academy Television (BAFTA) Craft Award for Original Television Music in April 2014. It was {{his first}} {{composition}} for television. Ólafur's music was widely praised. Mike Hale, writing in The New York Times, called it [...] "a tasty icing of gloom and foreboding", and noted that the show leaned very heavily on the mood that the music created. Cast members were equally as impressed with the music. Actress Jodie Whittaker has said that [...] "hearing the music by Ólafur Arnalds just broke me every time." [...] Actor Andrew Buchan was equally effusive. [...] "The power of music can draw people in more than they realise. I had never heard {{a piece of music}} like it. They deliberately went left-field with Ólafur Arnalds. I found it haunting, beautiful and desolate. It can make or break a show. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> your reasons for watching The Killing, the music that swells at the end draws you into watching another one.

2500|$|Comic Book Resources ranks Victor von Doom {{as their}} fourth {{favorite}} Marvel character.

Fellow journalist Jason Stanhope called his [...] "master of sorcery and technology an unusual combination", and also felt [...] "his inner sense of nobility sets him apart from lesser villains, in a similar manner to Magneto." [...] Von Doom has also been favorably regarded by those who wrote for the character; Stan Lee declared Doom his favorite villain, saying that Doom [...] "could come to the United States and he could do almost anything, and we could not arrest him because he has diplomatic immunity. Also, he wants to rule the world and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it, wanting to rule the world is not a crime.", that Doom technically isn't a villain. Mark Waid echoed Lee's assessment of the character, stating that Doom [...] " [...] got a great look, a great visual design [...] a dynamite origin." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 1990, {{an equally}} {{contentious}} discussion of vos Savant's article {{took place in}} Cecil Adams's column The Straight Dope (Adams 1990). Adams initially answered, incorrectly, that the chances for the two remaining doors must each be one in two. After a reader wrote in to correct the mathematics of Adams's analysis, Adams agreed that mathematically he had been wrong. [...] "You pick door #1. Now you're offered this choice: open door #1, or open door #2 and door #3. In the latter case you keep the prize if it's behind either door. You'd rather have a two-in-three shot at the prize than one-in-three, wouldn't you? <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it, the original problem offers you basically the same choice. Monty is saying in effect: {{you can keep your}} one door or you can have the other two doors, one of which (a non-prize door) I'll open for you." [...] Adams did say the Parade version left critical constraints unstated, and without those constraints, the chances of winning by switching were not necessarily two out of three (e.g., it was not reasonable to assume the host always opens a door). Numerous readers, however, wrote in to claim that Adams had been [...] "right the first time" [...] and that the correct chances were one in two.|$|E

60|$|However, I do {{not wish}} to dwell any further upon {{individual}} instances. Personal experience is a most vicious and limited circle. All that I desire to point out is the general principle that Life imitates Art far more than Art imitates Life, and I feel sure that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> seriously <b>about</b> it <b>you</b> will find that it is true. Life holds the mirror up to Art, and either reproduces some strange type imagined by painter or sculptor, or realises in fact what has been dreamed in fiction. Scientifically speaking, the basis of life--the energy of life, as Aristotle would call it--is simply the desire for expression, and Art is always presenting various forms through which this expression can be attained. Life seizes on them and uses them, even if they be to her own hurt. Young men have committed suicide because Rolla did so, have died by their own hand because by his own hand Werther died. Think of what we owe to the imitation of Christ, of what we owe to the imitation of Caesar.|$|R
5000|$|The {{title of}} the album, No Sound Without Silence, is both a {{shortening}} of philosophical idea put forward by the band and a critical comment on the music industry. No Sound Without Silence is a phrase derived from an idea put forward by the band, where meaningful statements cannot be made without thinking {{about what you want}} to say first; the [...] "silence" [...] referring to the silence that persists while a person <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> what they want to say, and the [...] "sound" [...] referring to the sounds made by people when they speak. The phrase is also a comment {{on the state of the}} music industry, where, according to the band, most artists and labels do not <b>think</b> critically <b>about</b> what they want to say, therefore, do not say meaningful things. The Script lead vocalist Danny O'Donoghue commented on the album's title, stating [...] "The time we've been away, we've had time to contemplate about what we want to say to the industry. There is no sound without silence. You can't have anything good to say <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it first".|$|R
