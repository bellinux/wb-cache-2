When the verse starts, Usher goes to a wide glass window pane, looking at his girlfriend swimming in the pool. The surface is aflame after she is immersed in the water. In the next scene, Usher and his mistress are having sex. While {{sitting on the edge}} of the bed, Usher reminisces about the moments he and his girlfriend had have <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>bed.</b> The bedsheets burn, the scene then cutting to Usher riding a silver right-hand drive Aston Martin DB5 with a British registration - EGF 158B (the car was featured in the TV series Fastlane). The video cuts with the backdrop also burning. Continuing to the car scene, Usher stops as he sees his imaginary girl again. He and dances, executing various hand routines. Video intercuts follow and the video ends with Usher standing. Right before the last chorus, the screen changes from a small screen to a full one with no framework.|$|E

Naz and Asher {{end up having}} sex, but he abandons her afterwards and Sol finds her and apologises. They reconcile but she feels guilty. The next day they wake up after spending the night <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>bed,</b> and Naz later watches Sol at dance rehearsals. Asher returns a necklace to Naz, and Sol sees this. He confronts her about it and she reveals she had a one-night stand with Asher but it meant nothing to her. She insists she did not receive Sol's text message {{but he is still}} angry. In an attempt to get Naz and Sol to reconcile again, Stevie pretends to swallow the key to the flat's front door, leaving them trapped. Naz reveals she is going to Turkey to meet Ekin's family and Sol angrily says she can stay there. When left alone, they get close again, but Asher interrupts them when he returns. Stevie drops the key revealing she did not swallow it and Sol thinks Naz was in on the plan so he sarcastically tells her to enjoy Turkey before leaving. She returns home and prepares to leave for Turkey but her father discovers she has escaped through a window. She returns to the flat but her father and Ekin come after her and try to take her back home. Sol stops the car and Naz gets out and they kiss. Later at the dance-off, she and her father talk and he finally accepts her choice of boyfriend.|$|E
5|$|The infant Lennon {{started at}} his first school in November 1945— Mosspits, on Mosspits Lane, Wavertree— so she found a {{part-time}} job at a café near the school. After numerous criticisms from the Stanley family about their (still-married) daughter 'living in sin' with John Dykins, and considerable pressure from Mimi—who twice contacted Liverpool's Social Services {{to complain about the}} infant Lennon sleeping <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>bed</b> as Julia and Dykins—she reluctantly handed the care of Lennon over to Mimi and her husband, George Smith. In July1946, Alf visited Mimi's house, 'Mendips' at 251Menlove Avenue, and took Lennon to Blackpool for a long holiday, but he was secretly intending to emigrate to New Zealand with him. Julia and Dykins found out and followed them to Blackpool. Alf asked Julia to go with them both to New Zealand, but she refused. After a heated argument, Alf said their five-year-old child had to choose between his mother or him. He chose Alf (twice) so Julia walked away, but in the end her son (crying) followed her, although this story has been disputed. According to author Mark Lewisohn, Lennon's parents agreed that Julia should take him and give him a home as Alf left again. A witness who was there that day, Billy Hall, has said the dramatic scene often portrayed with a young John Lennon having to make a decision between his parents never happened. Alf lost contact with the family until Beatlemania, when he and his son met again.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, many {{specimens}} of a previously unidentified dinosaur were found associated together <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>bed</b> and locality: a pebbly stratum near a route to Cerro Condor. The specimens were first described by Jose Bonaparte in 1979. For the fossil he erected the genus Patagosaurus, {{as well as}} its type species P. fariasi. The generic name of Patagosaurus comes from the location of its find in Patagonia, {{and the fact that it}} is a reptile. The specific name honours Ricardo Farias, on whose land the initial discovery was made. The genus was originally known from an almost complete postcranial skeleton lacking a skull as the holotype, and many referred specimens however in 2003 it was found that a dentary was referable to the species, so more specimens are probably this taxon. Its skeleton was found near those of Piatnitzkysaurus and Volkheimeria in the Callovian to Oxfordian aged Patagonian deposits of the Cañadón Asfalto Formation. Patagosaurus is almost completely known, with many articulated specimens found covering almost all of the skeleton, including parts of the skull. Over twelve specimens have been referred to the species, although some of the material is probably from a unique taxon. Bonaparte (1986) assigned three specimens other than the holotype PVL 4170, PVL 4076, MACN CH 934, and MACN CH 933 to the genus. While the holotype includes a post cranial skeleton, the others are known from cranial material and a nearly complete juvenile skeleton and skull. MACN CH 933 is directly comparable with the type material of Patagosaurus, which confirms its association with the genus. A specimen first referred to Patagosaurus in 2003, MPEF-PV 1670 (which includes just a lower jaw), is also very similar to MACN CH 934, and differences can be associated with age, so therefore, MPEF-PV 1670 presumably represents adult cranial material. However, the teeth of MACN CH 934 are very different from those of both lower jaws (MACN CH 933 and MPEF-PV 1670), so it can be identified as another sauropod from the same deposit as Patagosaurus. Thus, the taxon only certainly includes PVL 4170, MACN CH 933, and MPEF-PV 1670.|$|E

50|$|Although not {{the first}} small shelly fossil to be found, Cloudina {{is one of the}} {{earliest}} and most abundant. The evolution of external shells <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Late Ediacaran is thought to be a defence against predators, marking the start of an evolutionary arms race. While predatory borings are common in Cloudina specimens, no such borings have been found in Sinotubulites, a similar shelly fossil sometimes found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>beds.</b> <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> diameters of borings in Cloudina are proportional to the sizes of specimens, which suggests that predators were selective about the size of their prey. These two indications that predators attacked selectively suggest the possibility of speciation in response to predation, which is often postulated as a potential cause of the rapid diversification of animals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Early Cambrian.|$|R

25|$|In return, {{the family}} must leave {{a portion of}} their supper (or beer, for the bierasal) to the spirit and must treat the kobold with respect, never mocking or {{laughing}} at the creature. A kobold expects to be fed in the same {{place at the same time}} each day, or in the case of the Hütchen, once a week and on holidays. One tradition says that their favourite food is grits or water-gruel. Tales tell of kobolds with their own rooms; the kobold Heinzelmann had his own chamber at the castle, complete with furnishings. and King Goldemar was said to sleep <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>bed</b> with Neveling von Hardenberg. He demanded a place at the table and a stall for his horses. Keightley relates that maids who leave the employ of a certain household must warn their successor to treat the house kobold well.|$|E
25|$|Across the world, it {{is common}} for people to sleep <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>bed</b> as one another after copulation. Humans are {{more likely to engage in}} sexual {{activity}} at night, so therefore night-time brings the highest danger of infidelity. Due to females investing more in the relationship (Parental investment), women therefore receive more benefits from sleeping with their mate during the night. Keeping close proximity with a partner acts as a mate guarding technique as it minimises the likelihood of unfaithfulness by the male, and also assures their partner of her fidelity. As a result of the paternal confidence, the male is also more likely to stay and provide resources. In one study it was found that 73.7% of participants said that females are more likely to want to sleep together after sexual intercourse. Mate guarding is a very likely explanation to this, but it may also have the benefits of increasing the female's protection, potentially from male poachers.|$|E
5000|$|Odontogriphus was {{apparently}} {{a very rare}} species, accounting for less than 0.5% of the individual organisms found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> fossil <b>beds.</b> Most of the fossils consist of two parts of a split block of rock, the upper part giving a [...] "casting" [...] of the animal's upper surface and the lower giving one of its underside.|$|R
50|$|Cloudinids are {{important}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history of animal evolution for two reasons. They {{are among the}} earliest and most abundant of the small shelly fossils with mineralized skeletons, and therefore feature <b>in</b> <b>the</b> debate about why such skeletons first appeared <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Late Ediacaran. The most widely supported answer is that their shells are a defense against predators, as some Cloudina specimens from China bear the marks of multiple attacks, which suggests they survived {{at least a few}} of them. The holes made by predators are approximately proportional {{to the size of the}} Cloudina specimens, and Sinotubulites fossils, which are often found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>beds,</b> have so far shown no such holes. These two points suggest that predators attacked in a selective manner, and the evolutionary arms race which this indicates is commonly cited as a cause of the Cambrian explosion of animal diversity and complexity.|$|R
40|$|A type of leaf {{chlorosis}} {{is shown}} by plants of excelsa coffee growing in nursery beds in a lath house at the Instituto Agronômico, Campinas.

Seedling plants of arabica coffee growing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>beds</b> do not show chlorosis, but these symptoms are exhibited by arabica scions grafted on some excelsa rootstocks. Scions from chlorotic excelsa plants recover the normal color when grafted on arabica rootstock. Likewise, arabica scions that had become chlorotic after being grafted on excelsa rootstock recovered when transferred onto an arabica rootstock. Other grafting tests indicated that no pathological cause seems to be associated with this type of chlorosis, and that it is probably due to genetical characteristics of the excelsa root system that prevents the plants from absorbing enough iron from the soil imder marginal conditions...|$|R

Some present fables that demonstrate how different characters have different needs and motives, which is subjectively rational from each character's viewpoint, and that addressing these needs can empower peaceful relationships even if they start off in a different way. For example, in the fable The Old Man the Young Wife, the text relates a story wherein an old man marries a young woman from a penniless family. The young woman detests his appearance {{so much that she}} refuses to even look at him let alone consummate their marriage. One night, while she sleeps <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>bed</b> with her back facing the old man, a thief enters their house. She is scared, turns over, and for security embraces the man.

40|$|Acrostichum is {{considered}} today an opportunistic fern in disturbed areas, {{which indicates the}} first stages of colonisation of such zones. However, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fossil record, Acrostichum appears related to fluvio-lacustrine environments, freshwater marshes and mangrove deposits. We report here for first time fossil evidence of Acrostichum that reveals a pioneering behaviour of this fern <b>in</b> <b>the</b> colonisation of perturbed communities in Europe, which corroborates previous assumptions about the paleobiology of Acrostichum. Plant remains were collected from the Chattian (late Oligocene) La Val fossil site (Estadilla, Huesca, northeastern Spain) belonging to the Sariñena Formation, which mainly embraces crevasse splays, levees and floodplain deposits. Evidence shows that Acrostichum grew within the levee's vegetal community or close to/on the river banks {{as well as on}} floodplain areas and closer to/on the shores of ephemeral ponds. But most importantly, the observed co-existence of Equisetum and Acrostichum remains <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>beds</b> indicates that such strata represent short-lived inundated terrains, e. g., floodplains where the water table was temporarily stagnant. Evidence shows wetland environments dominated by pioneering taxa, implying a pioneering role for Acrostichum during <b>the</b> late Oligocene <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Iberian Peninsula...|$|R
