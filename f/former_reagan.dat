25|$|Raised in secular Jewish culture, Novak lived {{seven decades}} as an agnostic. He briefly {{attended}} Unitarian and then Methodist {{services at the}} behest of his first and second wives, but he was not interested in either faith. He particularly disliked the Methodists' anti–Vietnam War position. Novak was introduced to Catholicism in the early 1980s when his friend Jeffrey Bell, a Republican political consultant and <b>former</b> <b>Reagan</b> aide, gave him some books on the Catholic faith. At that time, Novak had nearly died from spinal meningitis.|$|E
25|$|After {{wrapping}} up the 1988 Republican nomination, Bush selected Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana {{as his running}} mate, surprising many who expected Bush to select a more experienced running mate. Quayle was often mocked for his verbal gaffes, and many Republicans urged Bush to dump Quayle from the ticket. Bush selected a mostly new Cabinet, but kept around many <b>former</b> <b>Reagan</b> officials, including Attorney General Dick Thornburgh. Bush's long-time friend James Baker, who had served as Reagan's Chief of Staff, became Secretary of State. Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney had previously served as Gerald Ford's Chief of Staff and would later serve as vice president under George W. Bush. Bush's first pick for Defense Secretary, John Tower, {{was rejected by the}} Senate, becoming the first cabinet nominee of an incoming president to be rejected. Brent Scowcroft was appointed as the National Security Advisor, a role he had also held under Ford.|$|E

2500|$|While {{the film}} depicts Wilson as an {{immediate}} advocate for supplying the mujahideen with Stinger missiles, a <b>former</b> <b>Reagan</b> administration official recalls {{that he and}} Wilson, while advocates for the mujahideen, were actually initially [...] "lukewarm" [...] {{on the idea of}} supplying these missiles. Their opinion changed when they discovered that rebels were successful in downing Soviet gunships with them. As such, they were actually not supplied until the second Reagan administration term, in 1987, and their provision was advocated mostly by Reagan defense officials and influential conservatives.|$|E
