40|$|The {{design of}} modern aircrafts {{propulsion}} systems is {{strongly influenced by}} the important objective of environmental impact reduction. Through {{a great number of}} researches carried out in the last decades, significant improvements have been obtained in terms of lower fuel consumption and pollutant emission. Experimental tests are a necessary step to achieve new solutions that are more efficient than the current designs, even if during the preliminary design phase, a valid alternative to expensive experimental tests is the implementation of numerical models. The processing power of modern computers allows indeed the simulation of more complex and detailed phenomena than the past years. The present work focuses on the implementation of a numerical model for rotating stepped labyrinth seals installed in low-pressure turbines. These components are widely employed in sealing turbomachinery to reduce the leakage flow between rotating components. The numerical simulations were performed by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodology, focusing on the leakage performances at different rotating speeds and inlet preswirl ratios. Investigations on velocity profiles into seal cavities were also carried out. To begin with, a smooth labyrinth seal model was validated by using the experimental data found in the literature. The numerical simulations were extended to the honeycomb labyrinth seals, with the validation performed on the velocity profiles. Then, the effects of two geometrical parameters, the rounded <b>fin</b> tip <b>leading</b> <b>edge,</b> and the step position were numerically investigated for both smooth and honeycomb labyrinth seals.

The fin surface temperature was experimentally estimated with the novel methodology developed in the present study. Experimental data of local frost thickness, air pressure drop across the coils, time of frost-defrost cycles and heat transfer rates were recorded for heat exchangers operating in actual transient frosting conditions. Data showed that the frosting time and the frost growth rates were depended mainly on the local fin surface temperature. A set of empirical correlations were developed to predict the frost thickness on <b>fin</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> and the reduction of air face velocity due to air pressure drop across the frosted coil during frosting operation. The correlations aid to calculate the instantaneous air-side Reynolds numbers during frosting operation of the fin samples.
