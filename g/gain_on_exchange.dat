5000|$|This kind of {{transaction}} is {{also called}} a “1031 exchange,” because Internal Revenue Code section 1031 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code allows owners of {{certain kinds of}} assets to defer capital <b>gains</b> taxes <b>on</b> any <b>exchange</b> of like-kind properties. Both the relinquished property and the acquired property must be like-kind, and must be held for business or investment purposes. The sum of assets of {{each side of the}} exchange must be equal in value. Taxes <b>on</b> capital <b>gains</b> are not charged upon sale of a property if a qualifying replacement property is acquired. The transaction has to be properly structured, including that the taxpayer cannot be deemed to have actually or constructively received the sales price of the relinquished property. To avoid [...] "constructive receipt" [...] of the sales proceeds, a neutral party is often used to maintain the sales proceeds {{out of the reach of}} the taxpayer. The replacement property generally must be [...] "identified" [...] within 45 days of when the original property is transferred, and must be [...] "acquired" [...] within 180 days of when the original property is transferred. If the transaction is handled properly, the payment of tax is deferred until the replacement property is later sold with no reinvestment in a qualifying property.|$|R

40|$|Before {{addressing}} Joseph Henrich’s evolutionary {{explanation for}} altruism, {{it is important}} to ask whether the existing evidence taken in its entirety actually suggests that preferences are non-selfish in the standard game-theoretic (myopic) sense. Our own research corroborates Henrich’s claim that the amount offered in ultimatum and dictator games is greater than predicted by standard economic theory based on payoff dominance. We also find, however, that this fact alone is subject to over interpretation, and that its robustness should be tested in less restrictive interactions. Specifically, the interpretation of the results in these decision environments confound the following motives: (1) self-interest based on dominance; (2) positive reciprocity; (3) negative reciprocity; (4) various forms of other-regarding utility, altruism representing only one such form; and (5) the constant sum form of some games precludes effects based <b>on</b> <b>gains</b> from <b>exchange.</b> Even within this class of games, the altruistic utilitarian explanation for giving does not accord well with the fact that experimental instructions and procedures typically have a dramatic affect on outcomes (Hoffman et al., 1994, 1996). Thus, in the ultimatum game offers by the first mover vary from 44. 4 percent of the available sum down to only 27. 8 percent for subjects from the same American undergraduat...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the causal nexus between capital inflows (foreign direct investment and foreign portfolio investment) and exchange rate in Nigeria. It also examined {{the impact of these}} capital inflows <b>on</b> <b>exchange</b> rate in Nigeria for the period spanning 1986 to 2011. The study employed both granger causality and error correction modelling techniques. The causality estimates showed no causal link between capital inflows (foreign direct investment and foreign portfolio investment) and exchange rate within this period. The long run regression estimate revealed that foreign direct investment had negative effect <b>on</b> <b>exchange</b> rate while portfolio investment had positive impact <b>on</b> <b>exchange</b> rate. However, the magnitude of the impacts was very minute unlike the international oil price which had a strong negative effect <b>on</b> the <b>exchange</b> rate. The result of the short run result was similar to the causality result, indicating that neither foreign direct investment nor foreign portfolio investment had significant impact <b>on</b> <b>exchange</b> rate.

30|$|The {{determinants}} of exchange rates have attracted considerable attention among researchers {{over the past}} several decades. Most studies, however, ignore the possibility that the impact of oil shocks <b>on</b> <b>exchange</b> rates could vary across the exchange rate returns distribution. We employ a quantile regression approach to address this issue. Our results indicate that the effect of oil shocks <b>on</b> <b>exchange</b> rates is heterogeneous across quantiles. A large US depreciation or appreciation tends to heighten the effects of oil shocks <b>on</b> <b>exchange</b> rate returns. Positive oil demand shocks lead to appreciation pressures in oil-exporting countries and this result is robust across lower and upper return distributions. These results offer rich and useful information for investors and decision-makers.|$|R
40|$|Taxation of Companies <b>on</b> Capital <b>Gains</b> <b>on</b> Shares under Domestic Law, EU Law and Tax Treaties, {{comprising}} the proceedings and working documents of a seminar held in Milan on 26 November 2012, is a detailed and comprehensive {{study on the}} taxation of capital <b>gains</b> <b>on</b> shares derived by companies. The book begins by discussing the trends in the taxation of capital <b>gains</b> <b>on</b> shares under domestic law, {{taking into account the}} input from various national reports. It then considers the taxation of capital <b>gains</b> <b>on</b> shares in the context of EU law. In this field, issues such as the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice, the hindrance to the internal market caused by double taxation of capital <b>gains</b> <b>on</b> shares and the possible impact of the EU income tax directives are examined. Next, the book discusses the taxation of capital <b>gains</b> <b>on</b> shares under tax treaties. The focus initially is on the notion of “capital <b>gains</b> <b>on</b> shares” in the OECD Model Convention and the qualification conflicts possibly arising in this respect. In addition, attention is also devoted to tax treaty aspects of company reorganizations that could trigger taxation of capital <b>gains</b> <b>on</b> shares and to tax treaty provisions regarding shares attributable to permanent establishments and non-discrimination. Finally, the application of domestic and agreement-based anti-abuse rules to transfers of shares is thoroughly analysed, with an eye also on recent rules and doctrines aimed at taxing indirect transfers. Individual country surveys provide an in-depth analysis of the above issues from a national viewpoint in North America, selected European jurisdictions, Australia, China and India...|$|R

50|$|The {{academic}} literature largely ignores cross-listings <b>on</b> non-U.S. <b>exchanges.</b> However, {{there are many}} cross-listings <b>on</b> <b>exchanges</b> in Europe and Asia. Even U.S. firms are cross-listed in other countries. In the 1950s there was a wave of cross-listings of U.S. firms in Belgium, in the 1960s in France, in the 1970s in the U.K., and in the 1980s in Japan (see Sarkissian and Schill, 2014). Roosenboom and van Dijk (2009) analyze 526 cross-listings from 44 different countries on 8 major stock exchanges and document significant stock price reactions of 1.3% on average for cross-listings <b>on</b> US <b>exchanges,</b> 1.1% <b>on</b> London Stock <b>Exchange,</b> 0.6% <b>on</b> <b>exchanges</b> in continental Europe, and 0.5% <b>on</b> Tokyo Stock <b>Exchange.</b> These findings suggest that cross-listings <b>on</b> Anglo-Saxon <b>exchanges</b> create more value than <b>on</b> other <b>exchanges.</b> They also highlight the incomplete understanding of why firms cross-list outside the UK and the United States, {{as many of the}} arguments discussed above (enhanced liquidity, improved disclosure, and bonding) do not apply. In this respect, Sarkissian and Schill (2014) show that cross-listing activity in a given host country coincides with the outperformance of host and proximate home country’s economies and financial markets, thus, highlighting the market timing component in cross-listing decisions.|$|R
