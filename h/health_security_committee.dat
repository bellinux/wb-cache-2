Of 29 responding countries, 26 organised national pandemic influenza vaccination and one country had recommendations for vaccination but {{did not have a}} specific programme. Of the 27 countries with vaccine recommendations, all recommended it for healthcare workers and pregnant women. Twelve countries recommended vaccine for all ages. Six and three countries had recommendations for specific age groups in children and in adults, countries for specific adult age groups. Most countries recommended vaccine for those in new risk groups identified early in the pandemic such as morbid obese and people with neurologic diseases. Two thirds of countries started their vaccination campaigns within a four week period after week 40 / 2009. The reported vaccination coverage varied between countries from 0. 4 % to 59 % for the entire population (22 countries); 3 % to 68 % for healthcare workers (13 countries); 0 % to 58 % for pregnant women (12 countries); 0. 2 % to 74 % for children (12 countries). Most countries identified similar target groups for pandemic vaccine, but substantial variability in vaccination coverage was seen. The recommendations were in accordance with policy advice from the EU <b>Health</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Committee</b> and the World Health Organization.

40|$|Pandemic {{vaccines}} {{from four}} manufacturers {{are now available}} for use within the European Union (EU). Use of these vaccines will protect individuals and reduce the impact on health services to more manageable levels. The majority of the severely ill will be from known risk groups and the best strategy will be to start vaccinating {{in line with the}} recommendation from the European Union <b>Health</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Committee</b> prioritising adults and children with chronic conditions, pregnant women and healthcare workers. The composition of authorised vaccines is reviewed in this article. The vaccine strain in all authorised pandemic vaccines worldwide is based on the same initial isolate of influenza A/California/ 7 / 2009 (H 1 N 1) v but the vaccines differ in conditions for virus propagation, antigen preparation, antigen content and whether they are adjuvanted or not. The vaccines are likely to be effective since no significant genetic or antigenic drift has occurred and there are already mechanisms for estimating clinical effectiveness. Influenza vaccines have good safety records and no safety concerns have so far been encountered with any of the vaccines developed. However, special mechanisms have been devised for the early detection and rigorous investigation of possible significant side effects in Europe through post-marketing surveillance and analysis. Delivery of the vaccines to the risk groups will pose difficulties where those with chronic illnesses are not readily identifiable to the healthcare services. There is considerable scope for European added value through Member States with excess vaccines making them available to other states...|$|E

40|$|The {{health system}} in Nepal is {{characterized}} by a wide network of health facilities and community workers and volunteers. Nepalâ€™s Interim Constitution of 2007 addresses health as a fundamental right, stating that every citizen has the right to basic health services free of cost. But the reality is a far cry. Only 61. 8 % of the Nepalese households have access to health facilities within 30 min, with significant urban (85. 9 %) and rural (59 %) discrepancy. Addressing barriers to health services needs urgent interventions at the population level. Recently (February 2015), the Government of Nepal formed a Social <b>Health</b> <b>Security</b> Development <b>Committee</b> as a legal framework to start implementing a social <b>health</b> <b>security</b> scheme (SHS) after the National Health Insurance Policy came out in 2013. The program has aimed to increase the access of health services to the poor and the marginalized, and people in hard to reach areas of the country, though challenges remain with financing. Several aspects should be considered in design, learning from earlier community-based health insurance schemes that suffered from low enrollment and retention of members as well as from a pro-rich bias. Mechanisms should be built for monitoring unfair pricing and unaffordable copayments, and an overall benefit package be crafted to include coverage of major health services including non-communicable diseases. Regulations should include such issues as accreditation mechanisms for private providers. Health system strengthening should move along with the roll-out of SHS.

40|$|Problem statement: Malaysia {{has come}} out with a number of {{strategies}} such as National Information Technology Center, Universal Services Provider, Rural Internet Center and Rural Info Center to strengthen and encourage ICT usage among the rural community. Besides the efforts that are brought by the government, do the rural community especially their leaders which are the Village Development and <b>Security</b> <b>Committee</b> use ICT? Approach: The main objective {{of this study was to}} investigate any relationship that might occur between variables of Technology Acceptance Model and ICT usage among Village Development and <b>Security</b> <b>Committee.</b> A total of 240 Village Development and <b>Security</b> <b>Committees</b> were selected as the respondents for this study where a developed questionnaire was used to gain the data needed. For the purpose of analysis, SPSS was used where descriptive and inferential analyses were performed. Results: Based on the analyses run, it can be concluded that Village Development and <b>Security</b> <b>Committee</b> in Malaysia have a moderate level of ICT usage. Further analyses run showed that all of the three variables of Technology Acceptance Model namely attitude, perceive ease of use and perceive usefulness have a positive and significant relationship with ICT usage while attitude was detected as the main contributor towards ICT usage among Village Development and <b>Security</b> <b>Committee.</b> Conclusion/Recommendation: This study has revealed that Technology Acceptance Model that was used to explain ICT usage can be applied within the Malaysian rural setting. It also can be concluded that Village Development and <b>Security</b> <b>Committee</b> with a high level of attitude, perceive ease of use and perceive usefulness towards ICT will have higher level of ICT usage. To further develop and sustain this high level of attitude, perceive ease of use and perceive usefulness towards ICT usage, Village Development and <b>Security</b> <b>Committee</b> must be frequently exposed to ICT information and knowledge. It is recommended that ICT house to house training can be conducted among the Village Development and <b>Security</b> <b>Committee</b> by the related agencies...|$|R
