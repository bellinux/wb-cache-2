25|$|Cylinder records {{continued}} {{to compete with}} the growing disc record market into the 1910s, when discs won the commercial battle. In 1912, Columbia Records, which had been selling both discs and cylinders, dropped the cylinder format, while Edison introduced his unique <b>Diamond</b> <b>Disc</b> format. Beginning in 1915, new Edison cylinder issues were simply dubs of Edison discs and therefore had lower audio quality than the disc originals. Although his cylinders sold in ever-dwindling and eventually tiny quantities, Edison {{continued to}} support owners of cylinder phonographs by making new titles available in that format as late as mid-1929.|$|E

5000|$|During the 78 era, {{when the}} maximum {{capacity}} of a single ordinary record side or cylinder was less than five minutes, Spalding recorded extensively for Edison Records, with some issues on cylinders and many more on <b>diamond</b> <b>discs.</b> Most featured short works or encore pieces that could fit on a single record side. These recordings were all by the acoustical process, as well as vertically-cut, through 1925, but {{he made his first}} electrical recordings in 1926 for Brunswick Records using that company's problematic [...] "Light-Ray" [...] system. After his unsatisfactory experience with Brunswick, Spalding went back to Edison and made some electrical Edison hill-and-dale <b>Diamond</b> <b>Discs</b> as well as a very few Edison [...] "Needle Cut" [...] lateral recordings in late 1928. These were much better recorded than Spalding's Brunswicks, but the <b>Diamond</b> <b>Discs</b> sold as scantily as the rest of Edison's product in that period, and the [...] "Needle-Cut" [...] discs were issued only for a very short time—from August to November 1929—and are exceedingly rare today. Following the Edison company's demise in November 1929, he recorded a handful of more extended works broken across multiple sides for RCA Victor Records.|$|R

5000|$|Like {{cylinder}} records, {{the sound}} in a <b>Diamond</b> <b>Disc's</b> groove was {{recorded by the}} [...] "hill-and-dale" [...] method, as variations in {{the depth of the}} groove cut. At that time, with the notable exception of Pathé Records, which used yet another incompatible format, a disc's groove was normally of constant depth and modulated laterally, side-to-side. The vertical format demanded a perfectly flat surface for best results, so Edison made his <b>Diamond</b> <b>Discs</b> about one-quarter of an inch (6 mm) thick. They consisted of a thin coating of a hard plastic virtually identical to Bakelite on a core of compressed wood flour, and later also china clay. With very rare exceptions, all were about ten inches in diameter, but they used a finer groove pitch (150 threads per inch, or [...] "TPI") and could play longer than ordinary ten-inch records—up to five minutes per side.|$|R

50|$|Usually {{taking up}} a blank side of vinyl, rather than {{containing}} music, {{one side of}} a disc can be pressed with etched or embossed images. This can take the form of autographs, part of the artwork or logos. Earliest records produced by Emile Berliner, as those by other early companies as Zonophone had etched labels, before paper labels were widely used. Many early Edison <b>Diamond</b> <b>Discs</b> did have etched labels as well, with many (if not all) also featuring a little etched picture of Thomas Edison.|$|R
5000|$|Although Victor's Victrolas {{and similar}} record players could not play Diamond Discs (at best, only very faint sound would be heard, while the crude steel needle seriously damaged the groove) and Edison <b>Diamond</b> <b>Disc</b> Phonographs could not play Victor or other lateral-cut discs, {{third-party}} suppliers {{came up with}} adapters, such as the Kent adapter, to defeat this incompatibility, but typically with less than optimal sound quality.

5000|$|Vernon Archibald was an American baritone.

[...] This group was frequently found on the radio and performing on the stage circuit.|$|R
50|$|The first {{phonograph}} cylinders were {{manufactured in}} 1888, followed by Edison's {{foundation of the}} Edison Phonograph Company in the same year. The recorded wax cylinders, later replaced by Blue Amberol cylinders, and vertical-cut <b>Diamond</b> <b>Discs,</b> were manufactured by Edison's National Phonograph Company from 1896 on, reorganized as Thomas A. Edison, Inc. in 1911. Until 1910 the recordings did not carry {{the names of the}} artists. The company began to lag behind its rivals in the 1920s, both technically and in the popularity of its artists, and halted production of recordings in 1929.|$|R
5000|$|Thus, Victor and Columbia {{began making}} flat {{records in the}} U.S., with UK Gramophone and others {{continuing}} to do so outside the U.S. This left Edison the only {{major player in the}} making of cylinders; Columbia still made a limited number for a few years. Emile Berliner went out of the business. All he had left were the masters of his earlier records. These he took to Canada and reformed his Berliner label in Montreal, where he used the [...] "His Master's Voice" [...] trademark.

40|$|Abstract The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the effect of grinding on roughness, flexural strength, and reliability of a zirconia ceramic before and after heat treatment. Seven groups were tested (n = 15) : a control group (labeled CG, untreated), and six groups of samples ground with <b>diamond</b> <b>discs,</b> simulating <b>diamond</b> burs, with grits of 200 µm (G 80); 160 µm (G 120), and 25 µm (G 600), either untreated or heat-treated at 1200 °C for 2 h (labeled A). Yttria tetragonal zirconia polycrystal discs were manufactured, ground, and submitted to roughness and crystalline phase analyses before the biaxial flexural strength test. There was no correlation between roughness (Ra and Rz) and flexural strength. The reliability of the materials was not affected by grinding or heat treatment, but the characteristic strength was higher after abrasion with <b>diamond</b> <b>discs,</b> irrespective of grit size. The X-ray diffraction data showed that grinding leads to a higher monoclinic (m) phase content, whereas heat treatment produces reverse transformation, leading to a fraction of m-phase in ground samples similar to that observed in the control group. However, after heat treatment, only the G 80 A samples presented strength {{similar to that of}} the control group, while the other groups showed higher strength values. When zirconia pieces must be adjusted for clinical use, a smoother surface can be obtained by employing finer-grit diamond burs. Moreover, when the amount of monoclinic phase is related to the degradation of zirconia, the laboratory heat treatment of ground pieces is indicated for the reverse transformation of zirconia crystals...|$|R
