500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Cogman described some of the thought process he had when writing the reunion between Samwell and his family, saying, [...] "As much as Sam has gone through, I love exploring those family dynamics. His mother and sister and brother are all fundamentally decent people but his father is just a cold hearted bastard when <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> distant son. There's a painful part of the scene where his father just unloads on him and tells him every hateful thing he ever thought about him and Sam can't defend himself. We found that fascinating – Sam has killed a man, he's killed a White Walker, he's emerged as such a great hero, but he still can't stand up to his dad." ...|$|E

Misha Zilberman, who debuted at the London 2012 Olympic Games as Israel's first badminton Olympian, claimed his Olympic spot {{as one of}} the top 34 individual shuttlers in the BWF World Rankings as of 5 May 2016. According to Zilberman, his ambition is [...] "to win a medal at the European or World Championships or the Olympic Games." [...] When <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> Olympic training regimen, he said [...] "training under my parents is hard because on the court, they are always trying to push me to my limit." [...] Zilberman's win was Israel's first badminton win at the Olympics. He lost to Chou Tien-chen, and Chou's victory over Yuhan Tan eliminated Zilberman from competition.|$|E

Betty pulls him aside and tells him that she is simply too old to date him and is sorry; Peter, still downtrodden, remembers what the Rhino said and asks a {{reporter}} if he knows about anyone by that name. The reporter tells him about L. Thompson Lincoln, a philanthropist who is rumored to be a dangerous crime lord. That night Peter goes to Lincoln's office as Spider-Man {{to find out if the}} rumors are true. Lincoln prefers to be called [...] "Tombstone" [...] and wields incredible strength; he pins him down and suggests that he work for him, fighting crime like usual but turning his head when <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> crimes.

500|$|The decision, by Judge Paul Breckenridge, {{found that}} Armstrong's fears of {{persecution}} by the Church were reasonable, and thus his conduct in {{turning over the}} documents in his possession to his attorneys was also reasonable. The judge issued a wide-ranging verdict, commenting of Hubbard that [...] "the evidence portrays {{a man who has}} been virtually a pathological liar when <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> history, background and achievements." [...] A few weeks later, a British judge ruled in a case heard at the Royal Courts of Justice that Hubbard had made a number of [...] "false claims" [...] about his military career: [...] "That he was a much decorated war hero. He was not. That he commanded a corvette squadron. He did not. That he was awarded the Purple Heart, a gallantry decoration for those wounded in action. He was not wounded and was not decorated. That he was crippled and blinded in the war and cured himself with Dianetics techniques. He was not crippled and was not blinded." [...] The judge, Mr. Justice Latey, noted: [...] "There is no dispute about any of this. The evidence is unchallenged." ...|$|E
500|$|Morley took a {{break from}} Neighbours in mid-2012, which led the writers to improvise an {{on-screen}} break up for Aidan and Chris. The break up occurs after Aidan learns Chris has not told his parents {{that they are in}} a relationship. Mason said that Chris is fine with his friends knowing about his relationship, but it is different story when <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> parents. His father has not always made things easy for him in the past, so he does not give him and his mother a chance to get to know Aidan. When Chris' parents throw him a birthday party at Lassiter's Lake, he decides not to invite Aidan. However, Aidan learns about the party from Andrew and he feels [...] "hurt and humiliated" [...] by Chris' actions. Aidan makes it clear to Chris that their relationship is over and Mason added [...] "That's when the gravity of the situation hits Chris, and he's left in shock. He thinks, 'How did it come to this?'. Things really seemed to be falling into place with Aidan." [...] Chris then learns that his parents would have accepted the relationship and he realises that he has lost Aidan due to an assumption.|$|E

6000|$|The colonel smiled grimly. [...] "It is {{a comfort}} {{to think that}} we are going to get rid of him, O'Connor; he is enough to demoralize a whole brigade, to say nothing of a battalion, and the worst of it is he respects no one. I am as {{convinced}} as can be that it was he who fastened that baste of a bird in my shako the other day, and made me the laughing stock of the whole regiment on parade. Faith, I could not for the life of me make out what was the matter, there was a tugging and a jumping and a fluttering overhead, and I thought the shako was going to fly away. It fairly gave me a scare, for I thought the shako had gone mad, and that the divil was in it.

When he is there in the court telling it, he will not think much of Mr. Lax, nor even of Pat Carroll, {{who will be in}} the dock glaring at him; nor would he think much of {{anything}} but his direct story, while a friendly barrister is drawing it out of him; but when <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> cross-examination, it will be different. He will want all his pluck then, and all the simplicity which he can master. You must remember that a skilful man will have been turned loose on him with all the ferocity of a bloodhound; a man who will have all the cruelty of Lax, but will have nothing to fear; a man who will be serving his purpose all round if he can only dumbfound that poor boy by his words and his looks. A man, when he has taken up the cause of these ruffians, learns to sympathise with them. If they hate the Queen, hate the laws, hate all justice, these men learn to hate them too. When they get hold of me, and I look into the eyes of such a one, I see there my bitterest enemy. He holds Captain Yorke Clayton up to the hatred of the whole court, as though he were a brute unworthy of the slightest mercy,--a venomous reptile, against whom the whole country should rise to tear him in pieces. And I look round and see the same feeling written in the eyes of them all. I found it more hard to get used to that than to the snap of a pistol; but I have got used to it. Poor Florian will have had no such experience. And there will be no mercy shown to him because he is only a boy. Neither sex nor age is supposed to render any such feeling necessary to a lawyer. A lawyer in defending the worst ruffian that ever committed a crime will know that he is called upon to spare nothing that is tender. He is absolved from all the laws common to humanity. And then poor Florian has lied." [...] A gloomy look of sad, dull pain came across the father's brow as he heard these words. [...] "We must look it in the face, Mr. Jones." ...|$|E
