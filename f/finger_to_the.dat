5|$|Though not aggressive, {{the common}} {{stingray}} can inflict an excruciating wound with its serrated, venomous tail spine. The ancient Greeks and Romans greatly feared its venom, with authors such as Aelian (175–235 AD) stating that stingray wounds were incurable. The Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder (23–79 AD), in his Natural History, asserted that its spine {{was capable of}} killing trees, piercing armor like an arrow, and corroding iron. Greek poet Oppian (172–210 AD) claimed that the touch of stingray venom could even dissolve stone. In Greek mythology, Hercules {{was said to have}} lost a <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bite of a stingray, and Circe was said to have armed her son Telegonus with a spear tipped with a stingray spine, with which he accidentally slew his father Odysseus.|$|E
5|$|After the Cournoyer goal, {{the goal}} judge refused {{to put the}} goal light on {{despite the fact that}} it was signalled a goal on the ice. In response, Alan Eagleson (seated across the ice from the Team Canada bench) {{attempted}} to reach the timer's bench to protest, causing a ruckus in the crowd as he made his way to the timer's bench. As he was being subdued by the Soviet police, the Canadian players headed over and Peter Mahovlich jumped over the boards to confront police with his stick. Eagleson was freed and the coaches escorted him across the ice to the bench. In anger, he shoved his fist to the Soviet crowd, as a few other Canadian supporters also gave the <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Soviets. The Soviets continued to play defensively. Sinden speculates the Soviets were willing to accept the tie and win the series on goal differential.|$|E

25|$|Hyperkinesia, more {{specifically}} chorea, is the hallmark symptom of Huntington's disease, formerly {{referred to as}} Huntington’s chorea. Appropriately, chorea {{is derived from the}} Greek word, khoros, meaning “dance.” The extent of the hyperkinesia exhibited in the disease can vary from solely the little <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> entire body, resembling purposeful movements but occurring involuntarily. In children, rigidity and seizures are also symptoms.|$|E
25|$|The wrist of Confuciusornis shows fusion, {{forming a}} carpometacarpus. The {{second and third}} metacarpals were also {{partially}} fused, but the first was unfused, and the fingers could freely move relative to each other. The second metacarpal, which supported the flight feathers, was very heavily built; its finger carries a small claw. The claw of the first <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> contrary was very large and curved. The stub-like third metacarpal, which supported the calami of the feathers, was probably enclosed in {{the flesh of the}} hand. The formula of the finger phalanges was 2-3-4-0-0.|$|E
50|$|Mehegan {{was born}} in Wethersfield, Connecticut, and began playing the piano {{at the age of}} five. He taught himself to play by {{matching}} his <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> notes played on a neighborhood player piano. His mother gave him violin lessons, but he preferred piano.|$|R

25|$|Aoki has {{received}} criticisms by the mixed martial arts community for his disrespectful victory celebrations and perceived {{lack of care}} for his opponents, often causing injuries which are seen as needless. He firstly became known for breaking Keith Wisniewski's arm, then doing the same with Kuniyoshi Hironaka via flying armbar in a Brazilian jiu-jitsu bout, sidelining him for a year. In 2009, controversy would come when he faced Mizuto Hirota in a super bout. After Aoki won by breaking Hirota's arm in a brutal fashion, he gave the middle <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> downed fighter and the crowd while running excitedly.|$|E
25|$|On {{the upper}} surface {{we have a}} {{depiction}} of the distressed Virgin Mary being supported by John the Evangelist and two female saints ("Pamoison de la Vierge"), Mary Magdalene and Mary Salome. In the next scene Jesus is being flogged by two soldiers who tighten the blindfold as they apply their whips. On the frieze below the first sculpture on the left shows Elizabeth (biblical figure) visiting the Virgin Mary (the Visitation (Christianity)), the one pregnant with Jesus Christ {{and the other with}} John the Baptist, this being followed by three scenes relating to the nativity. Firstly we see Saint Joseph sleeping in the stable with two cattle next to him. Then we see the Virgin Mary laying in a bed {{and at the end of}} this bed is a depiction of a standing Jesus aged about 7 years this followed by the Adoration of the Magi. The first wise man is kneeling before the bed whilst the second, dressed in the doublet worn in the reign of Charles VII, is pointing with his <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> star which led them to the stable and addressing the third wise man who is smaller in stature.|$|E
500|$|People {{have given}} the finger {{as a method of}} {{political}} protest. [...] At a concert, Ricky Martin gave a picture of George W. Bush the finger to protest the War in Iraq. Serbian protesters gave the <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Russian embassy regarding their support of Slobodan Milošević. Artist Ai Weiwei has used the finger in photographs and sculptures as a political statement. As a political message to the Czech President, Czech artist David Cerny floated an outsize, purple statue of a hand on the River Vltava in Prague; its middle finger extended towards Prague Castle, the Presidential seat.|$|E

500|$|Polykleitos {{uses the}} distal phalanx {{of the little}} finger as the basic module for {{determining}} [...] the proportions of the human body. Polykleitos multiplies {{the length of the}} distal phalanx by the square root of two (√2) to get the distance of the second phalanges and multiplies the length again by √2 to get the length of the third phalanges. Next, he takes the finger length and multiplies that by √2 to get the length of the palm {{from the base of the}} <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ulna. This geometric series of measurements progresses until Polykleitos has formed the arm, chest, body, and so on.|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "Y.A.L.A.", {{the title}} of which stands for [...] "You Always Live Again", {{was seen as a}} {{response}} to the slogan [...] "Y.O.L.O." [...] ("You Only Live Once"), popularised by rapper Drake, who is also referenced on the album's title track. [...] The lyrics of [...] "Y.A.L.A." [...] refer to reincarnation, one of a number of concepts relating to Hinduism referenced on the album, including karma and the use of the om chant. [...] "Boom Skit" [...] contains lyrics which reference M.I.A.'s appearance at the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show, during which she controversially extended the middle <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camera while performing with Madonna. The short track [...] "Double Bubble Trouble" [...] contains lyrical elements similar to [...] "Trouble", a mid-90s hit for female duo Shampoo.|$|E
500|$|Madonna was {{not paid}} for {{performing}} at the halftime show, which provides global exposure for an artist. The {{show was a}} success, setting a Super Bowl halftime-show record of 114 million viewers (higher than the viewership of the game itself). Keith Caulfield of Billboard reported a 17-fold sales increase for Madonna's back catalog and strong preorder sales for her upcoming releases. Critics praised the show, noting Madonna's cautious performance. However, M.I.A. extended her middle <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camera {{near the end of}} her verse of [...] "Give Me All Your Luvn in place of the word [...] "shit". The rapper was criticized, and the NFL apologized for its inability to blur out the image. The league later fined M.I.A. $16.6 million, which was settled in a confidential 2014 agreement.|$|E

500|$|M.I.A. {{extended}} her middle <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camera {{near the end}} of her verse in [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin instead of singing the word [...] "shit", and the media compared the incident to Janet Jackson's 2004 wardrobe malfunction. According to People, [...] "Call it a finger malfunction? Madonna {{was supposed to be the}} center of attention during the Super Bowl halftime show Sunday, but the Queen of Pop was upstaged by her collaborator M.I.A., who flipped off the camera at one point during the performance, prompting swift apologies from the NFL and NBC." [...] Madonna expressed her disappointment in an interview with host Ryan Seacrest on his talk show, On Air with Ryan Seacrest. She said that it was a [...] "teenager ... irrelevant thing" [...] for M.I.A. to do, and was [...] "out of place" [...] in the show: [...] "I was really surprised. I didn't know anything about it. I wasn't happy about it. I understand it's punk rock and everything, but to me there was such a feeling of love and good energy and positivity; it seemed negative." ...|$|E
500|$|Two {{scenes in}} which Stewie {{graphically}} beats up Brian using a glass filled with orange juice, various household objects, and guns polarized people who viewed it. Several production members were offended. Cast members—as well as MacFarlane's mother and an animal rights advocate—enjoyed the scene; MacFarlane quoted his mother: [...] "I don't {{see what the}} problem is? He (Brian) owed him (Stewie) money!", {{and so it was}} kept in the final cut. When Lois gives the <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camera during the interview with Peter and Brady, her hand was blurred out on Fox airings of the episode. However, reruns on Adult Swim and TBS left the gesture intact. The gesture was also left intact on the DVD of [...] "Volume Four"; the production team enjoyed having this level of freedom. After the initial airing of the episode, where newscaster Tom Tucker announces a report on a fictional curse word, clemen, many viewers looked up the word on the Internet {{to try to find a}} definition. MacFarlane stated in the episode's DVD commentary that if someone invents an obscene definition for the word, the show will have to stop using it (it has not been used since this episode).|$|E
500|$|Lois mocking [...] (or, as it {{is called}} in the scene, Stymie Gruffin: The Untold Story), citing the movie as a middle <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{audience}} by being three episodes slapped together under the guise of a movie (followed by Brian calling in two bodyguards in suits to take Lois away) was edited on TV for time reasons. A deleted scene showed one of Peter's crimes being a hate crime, where during his stunt he hit a car with a Jewish driver. The televised scene changed the Jewish driver to a female virgin driver and the crime being a rape (her airbag having busted her hymen when it deployed) and not a hate crime. The scene of Stewie getting high on NyQuil to cope with losing Rupert and mistaking a throw pillow for a cat was cut from TV airings for time reasons. David Goodman noted that he feels the production crew may not have succeeded on this episode as everything falls into place easily, such as the box falling out of the moving truck. Every frame when Stewie is dancing in a montage of Anchors Aweigh took a large amount of work to produce.|$|E

50|$|A second {{common cause}} of negligent {{discharges}} is when the gun-handler places their finger on the trigger before they have decided <b>to</b> shoot. With <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> so positioned, many activities may cause <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> compress <b>the</b> trigger unintentionally. For example, if one attempts <b>to</b> holster <b>the</b> firearm with finger on trigger, the holster edge will drive the finger onto the trigger, and discharge is likely. If one stumbles or struggles (with an adversary) with finger on trigger, the grasping motion of both hands will likely cause <b>the</b> trigger <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> compress <b>the</b> trigger.|$|R

500|$|M.I.A. co-wrote {{the song}} [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin'" [...] with Madonna and Nicki Minaj for the album MDNA and {{performed}} {{it at the}} Super Bowl XLVI Halftime Show. Controversially, instead of singing the lyric [...] "shit" [...] in the song, M.I.A. extended the middle <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camera. The N.F.L. responded by filing a lawsuit suing M.I.A. for [...] millions in damages and demanding a public apology from M.I.A. Maya and her legal team also responded {{by saying that the}} league's claim of [...] "wholesomeness" [...] in the lawsuit is hypocritical since the N.F.L. itself has had multiple situations of their own players and coaches behaving badly as well as health problems within the league, particularly concussions. In September 2013 Maya released a video statement regarding the lawsuit. In her statement Arulpragasam said, [...] "They're basically [...] it's OK for me to promote being sexually exploited as a female, than to display empowerment, female empowerment, through being punk rock. That's what it boils down to, and I'm being sued for it." [...] The lawsuit was settled in August 2014; the terms of the settlement remain private.|$|E
500|$|The Shins {{were not}} truly a band when James Mercer {{composed}} the song, {{and the idea}} of making music his career seemed uncertain. The song's creation was partially a reaction to the music scene in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the band's hometown, which Mercer described as [...] "macho, really heavy, and aggressive." [...] He characterized it as a punk rock-esque move akin to giving the <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> entire town. The song was born out of frustration regarding his personal life and future. [...] "It's definitely a moment in my life, that sort of angst and confusion about what my future was going to be," [...] he remarked. He described it as a [...] "Saturn return" [...] period of his life, in which he felt he could not relate to anyone in his hometown and his life there had become depressing. He had become a [...] "hermit" [...] working on the band's debut album, Oh, Inverted World, and had lost interest in partying with friends. The line [...] "Gold teeth and a curse for this town" [...] refers to his songwriting talent and his feelings on Albuquerque.|$|E
500|$|Closing out the year, {{the album}} was named to {{multiple}} {{album of the year}} lists. Complex ranked the album at number 26, on their list of the 50 best albums of 2013. They commented saying, [...] "the album's cinematic feel puts Cudi in the director's seat as he compiles a diverse ensemble cast of luminaries, ranging from rap legends like RZA to indie rockers like Haim to West Coast spitters like Kendrick Lamar. The final product is proof Cudi can make a soundscape that others can easily adapt to, not the other way around." [...] XXL positioned it at number 25 on their list of the best albums of 2013. In December 2013, HipHopDX placed it on their list of the top 25 albums of the year saying, [...] "In a manner akin to Robert Johnson selling his soul to the devil to become a magician of a bluesman, Kid Cudi also clearly sold his soul to the demons that once claimed it in order to craft this album. There’s no singles here, just an intense and very listenable journey." [...] The Source ranked it at number 23 on their list, saying [...] "it delivered, sonically and conceptually. The album was an honest representation of the maturation of Cudi’s space age sound and middle <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> world attitude." ...|$|E
