Returning to Marlinspike Hall, they find that another acquaintance, the Emir of Khemed, Mohammed Ben Kalish Ezab, has been overthrown by his nemesis Sheikh Bab El Ehr; the Emir has {{accordingly}} sent his son, the disobedient and mischievous Abdullah, to stay at Marlinspike for his own protection. The police detectives Thomson and Thompson visit, informing Tintin that Alcazar is seeking to purchase military aircraft from J. M. Dawson.|$|E
5|$|Midshipman Jonathon Monkhouse {{proposed}} fothering the ship, as he {{had previously}} been on a merchant ship which used the technique successfully. He was entrusted with supervising the task, sewing bits of oakum and wool <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> sail, which was then drawn under the ship to allow water pressure to force it into {{the hole in the}} hull. The effort succeeded and soon very little water was entering, allowing the crew to stop two of the three pumps.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} set in a fictional kingdom where both magic and early 20th century {{technology}} are prevalent, against the backdrop of a war with another kingdom.

5|$|Air Mata Iboe {{was written}} and {{directed}} by Njoo Cheong Seng under his penname M. d'Amour; he had previously directed Djantoeng Hati (Heart and Soul; 1941), which also had a tragic ending, for the company. The film was produced by the company's owner, Fred Young. It starred Njoo's wife Fifi Young (no relation to Fred), RdIsmail, Ali Sarosa, and Ali Joego. Other roles were held by established singers of keroncong (traditional music with Portuguese influences), including Soerip, Titing, Soelami, Ning Nong, and Poniman. The film, which used make-up to make Fifi Young age <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> woman over the course of its plot, was the actress' first for Majestic; she had been ill during the production of her husband's debut for the company.|$|E
5|$|At least 20 {{publishers}} {{rejected the}} book before Geisel ran <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> college classmate, {{who had just}} become juvenile editor at Vanguard Press. Vanguard agreed to publish the book, and it met with high praise from critics upon release, though sales were not as impressive. Later analyses of the book have focused on its connections to Geisel's childhood; the street of the title is probably named after a street in Geisel's hometown of Springfield, Massachusetts. Geisel returned to fictionalized versions of Springfield in later books, and Marco appeared again in 1947 in the Dr. Seuss book McElligot's Pool.|$|E
5|$|Born <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> {{political}} family, Playford was {{the fifth}} Thomas Playford and the fourth to have lived in South Australia; his grandfather Thomas Playford II had served as premier in the 19th century. He {{grew up on the}} family farm in Norton Summit before enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force in World War I, fighting in Gallipoli and Western Europe. After serving, he continued farming until his election as a Liberal and Country League (LCL) representative for Murray at the 1933 state election. In his early years in politics, Playford was an outspoken backbencher who often lambasted LCL colleagues and ministers and their policies, and had a maverick strategy, often defying party norms and advocating unadulterated laissez faire economics and opposing protectionism and government investment, in stark contrast to his later actions as premier. With the resignation of the LCL's leader, Richard Layton Butler, Playford ascended to the premiership in 1938, having been made a minister just months earlier in an attempt to dampen his insubordination. Playford inherited a minority government and many independents to deal with, and instability was expected; Playford was seen as a transitional leader. However, Playford dealt with the independents adroitly and went on to secure a one-seat majority at the next election.|$|E

5|$|The Simpsons move <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> house, {{wondering}} at its low cost. Their {{questions are}} answered when the walls begin to bleed and objects begin to {{fly through the}} air, and Lisa senses an evil presence in the house. There is also a portal to another dimension in the kitchen. Marge expresses the desire to leave, but Homer asks her to sleep on it, due {{to the cost of}} buying the house. That night, the house possesses Homer and the children, manipulating their minds and making them chase each other with axes and knives. Marge unlike the others however, is instead using her knife to spread mayonnaise on a sandwich and intervenes, breaking the trance. Afterwards, Lisa discovers the source of the haunting - a Native American burial ground hidden in the basement. After the Spirit of The House threatens them again, Marge loses her patience and confronts the house, demanding that it treat them with respect during their stay. The house thinks it over, and eventually opts to destroy itself rather than live with the Simpsons.|$|E

50|$|The work is now {{recognised}} as {{a composite}} work formed of two originally distinct parts, conventionally {{referred to as}} Genesis A and Genesis B; the latter, lines 235-851 of the poem as we have it, {{appears to have been}} interpolated <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> poem to produce the current text.|$|R
50|$|Time moves at a {{different}} rate in Gemworld; a Gemworlder raised on Earth will change <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> form if brought back after several years, only to change back to normal if returned to Earth.

25|$|Krzyżanowski {{was born}} in Rożnowo, Grand Duchy of Poznań, <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> Polish noble family that bore the Świnka coat of arms, and whose roots reached back to the 14th century and {{ownership}} of the village of Krzyżanowo near Kościan.

25|$|Levett {{was born}} <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> Sussex family in Bodiam, {{near the border}} between Kent and Sussex, where her family had lived since medieval times. Bodiam Castle had been held by the Levett family during the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, and the lane near the castle was named for them. The once-powerful Anglo-Norman family, one of the county's oldest, had held manors and lands across Sussex. The study of medieval feudalism was {{probably}} in Levett's genes.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example of}} this {{situation}} occurs with a special form of liver transplant in which the recipient suffers from familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy, a disease where the liver slowly produces a protein that damages other organs.

By {{the end of the year}} Arthur has managed to raise twenty thousand pounds for the garden, and this is enough to tempt Willy to crime.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the retired}} Dr. Sam Loomis is visited {{by his friend}} Dr. Terence Wynn, the chief {{administrator}} of Smith's Grove Sanitarium, where Michael had been incarcerated as a boy; Wynn asks Loomis to return to Smith's Grove.

By 1622, he {{was familiar with the}} works of Jakob Böhme, and he met the mystic in person the following year. Franckenberg would continue to revere Böhme even after the latter’s death in 1624, and was a friend to several of Böhme's other followers, such as the Liegnitz physician Balthasar Walther.|$|E

25|$|At {{times we}} were forty prisoners {{in a cell}} built to {{accommodate}} two people. There were two benches, each capable of seating three persons, and the floor to sleep on.

25|$|He {{was born}} in Wyk auf Föhr, Province of Schleswig-Holstein, <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> {{seafaring}} family, {{the son of a}} sea captain. The generations-long seafaring tradition within his family charted an obvious course for his future. In 1895 he joined the merchant marine, serving for 7 years and volunteering in 1901 for MTBs. After one year, he returned to the merchant marine, serving several years aboard the 5-masted Preussen (at the time, the largest sailing ship in the world,) as Second Officer. In 1913 he decided to deviate from this career, and learned to fly. Having graduated and gaining licence No. 707, he became a flying instructor at a civilian flying school.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Our {{hypothesis}} is that escape analysis can estimate lifetime information for dynamically allocated objects. We then use this information to pretenure those objects that have long lifetimes. This technique avoids the cost incurred by a generational copying collector for copying long-lived objects from the nursery <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> generation. This approach is completely new- all past work on pretenuring has involved profiling; our approach instead employs static analysis. 1...|$|R
