40|$|In {{developing}} countries, the ex-situ biodiversity {{conservation is}} facing {{more and more}} the revolt of local communities around the protected areas. The participative approach underlined by Agenda 21 (the <b>global</b> <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> sustainable development <b>action</b> <b>of</b> Rio's Conference in 1992) seems to be unavoidable in {{the prospect of the}} resolution of numerous conflicts which oppose local communities and those areas management structures. However, describing this conflictual status, some authors underline the lack of research for making operational the concept of participatory management. This acknowledgement, combined with evidence of failure in reglementarist and repressive approaches conducted by many forest administrations, leads to the following concern: how to set up a conceptual transition scheme to a partnership around protected areas management? This is the preoccupation to which this study proposed to answer. On the whole, local communities justify the conflict which opposes them to the forest administration first by the dissatisfaction of their complaints relating to the socio-community infrastructures and then by the impacts of the reserve on their potential agricultural and para-agricultural outcomes. They also evoke the sharp repressions of the forest administration and the insecurity due to the aggressions by the animals apart from the conventional limits of the reserve. However, the analysis of the investigations' data revealed other more subtle causes but having effectively accentuated the conflict around the reserve. They are: the low levels of education and sensitizing of local communities, their lack of implication in the decision-making processes and the mode of communication between them and the management structures. These causes were also confirmed by the individual interviews carried out near the extra-villager actors. The results of the investigations and the various analyses led to the proposal for alternative solutions of management. These alternative solutions relate to various aspects of management of the reserve which were blamed during the analysis of perceptions. They were evaluated by the members of a consultative committee which represents all the stakeholders. The evaluation was done through criteria defined in comparison with the relevant stakes directly related to the conflict. To seek the alternative solution of greater score in each aspect of management, the results of this evaluation were subjected to multicriteria analyses by Weighted Sum method and Fuzzy Set Model. With resulting from each method, the solution of greater score was adopted as the consensual solution for all of the stakeholder groups. To take into account uncertainties related to the estimate of the criteria and the matrix of evaluation, hundred (100) scenarios were described by Monte Carlo Simulation. It comes out from these analyses that the original consensual solutions remain the same ones and can be summarized by the requirements of stakeholder groups. Those consensual solutions also act as recommendations of the study. " [...] Résumé abrégé par UMI...|$|R
40|$|Albania {{declared}} its independence on 28 November 1912. It was proclaimed Popular Republic {{at the end}} of World War II, on 11 January 1945. For a period of about 45 years the communist regime was conducted in terms of one of the strongest Stalinist dictatorships of the time. The elections of March 1991 sanctioned the change of the political and economic system. Albania began the process of building the rule of law, based on private property, free initiative and open market. Currently Albania is part of the NATO. After having satisfied the demands of the Stabilization and Association Agreement it has applied to obtain the EU member candidate status. Albania adheres to different International Organizations such as FAO and the WTO. In order to meet the demands arising from the ratification of various Conventions on Biological Diversity such as, Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, Nagoya Protocol etc [...] ., Albania has started an intensive legislative process. The study object of this thesis was carried out aiming at the realization of a scientific paper that can serve to the Albanian legislator for future legislative developments on Conservation and Sustainable Use of Farm Animal Genetic Resources. The main objectives of this work are listed as follows: -	Study and evaluation of the current Albanian legislation addressing issues of conservation and sustainable use of animal genetic resources for food and agriculture. -	Assessment of the level of approximation of this legislation with the institutional and legal international framework and the EU legislation. -	Comparative analysis of the national legislation with that of other countries of the Balkan region. -	Study and development of key issues to be addressed in the middle-term legislative process in order to align the Albanian legislation with the International and EU one. -	Recommendations for legislative interventions and institutional developments in order to fulfill the obligations stemming from its accession to International Organizations and / or Conventions / Protocols. The thesis is conceived and realized {{in the form of a}} document in which are treated issues related to the identification, conservation, management and sustainable economic use of biodiversity in farm animals. The study is conducted by applying a research methodology, in which are combined: (i) 	analysis of developments and achievements of the Albanian legislation, (ii) 	comparative analysis of the legislation of different countries of the region and the EU one, and (iii) 	 evaluation of the Albanian resources and opportunities for the implementation of the <b>Global</b> Strategy and <b>Plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>Action</b> for animal genetic resources for food and agriculture. Briefly, the issues addressed are as follows: The introduction provides a summarized data of the agricultural sector in Albania. It presents a synthesis of the major reforms developed in this sector, carried during the political and economic changes occurred in Albania after the fall of the communist system and the transition, from the centrally planned economy to the free market and private initiative. The first chapter provides a general view of the agricultural policy conducted in Albania during 1990 - 2013 and the major achievements in the development of the necessary legal framework. It addresses issues related to the agriculture privatization process. Albania's strategic goal was the full privatization of the agricultural economy.

The ITWG-AnGR's objectives are to review the situation and issues related to agrobiodiversity of animal genetic resources for food and agriculture and advise and make recommendations to the Commission on these matters, and consider progress resulting from proposed interventions.
