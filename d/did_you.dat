Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captainand we will smile. Many will say turn awayaway from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black manand we will smile. They will say that he is of hatea fanatic, a racistwho can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> ever talk to Brother Malcolm? <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> ever touch him, or have him smile at you? <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you <b>did</b> <b>you</b> would know him. And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him... And, in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves.|$|E
5|$|Both yes–no {{questions}} and wh-questions in English are mostly formed using subject–auxiliary inversion (Am I going tomorrow?, Where can we eat?), which may require do-support (Do you like her?, Where did he go?). In most cases, interrogative words (wh-words; e.g. what, who, where, when, why, how) {{appear in a}} fronted position. For example, in the question What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> see?, the word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence. (When the wh-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs: Who saw the cat?.) Prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the question's theme, e.g. To whose house <b>did</b> <b>you</b> go last night?. The personal interrogative pronoun who is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case, with the variant whom serving as the objective case form, although this form may be going out of use in many contexts.|$|E
