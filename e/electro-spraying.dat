40|$|An {{experimental}} study on <b>electro-spraying</b> from small-scale combustors {{is carried out}} using liquid ethanol as fuel. Two systems of <b>electro-spraying</b> are employed in the present study; one is a nozzle system (without a ring electrode) {{and the other is}} a nozzle-ring system (with a ring electrode). The photos of <b>electro-spraying</b> at the cone-jet mode are taken by a digital camera. The voltage drop across the resistance in the loop is measured by a data acquisition instrument, and the atomization current is calculated according to Ohm's Law. The size and velocity of <b>electro-spraying</b> droplets are measured by a Phase Doppler Anemometer. A non-dimensional analysis on atomization current is completed to explain the <b>electro-spraying</b> phenomena of liquid at the stable cone-jet mode. The results show that, the lower atomization current and droplet velocity corresponds to smaller size of droplet. Based on the results of non-dimensional analysis, it is found that the dimensionless atomization current in both the nozzle system and nozzle-ring system obeys the scaling law as square root of the dimensionless flow rate. The charge density is of a − 1. 5 power dependence on droplet diameter. Both of the nozzle and the nozzle-ring systems show a good agreement with Rayleigh instability...|$|E

The {{experimental studies}} on the ethanol <b>electro-spraying</b> cone-jet characteristics in the micro-scale combustors were carried out. The size and velocity distributions of the <b>electro-spraying</b> droplets were measured by a Phase Doppler Anemometer for both electrode configurations. Numerical calculation was performed to investigate {{the effects of the}} ring electrode on the electric field. A non-dimensional analysis was proposed to explain the liquid <b>electro-spraying</b> phenomena at the cone-jet mode. The results show that the electric field strength near the nozzle tip decreased when using the ring electrode with an appropriate voltage based on the superposition principle of the electric field, and the cone-jet mode could form at lower nozzle voltage without "satellite trapping". Compared with the nozzle system without the ring electrode, the nozzle-ring system could produce smaller and more uniform droplets because of the more stable cone-jet mode. It had been observed that the lower velocity of the droplets could have smaller size in the nozzle-ring system. The dimensionless droplet size in both the nozzle system and nozzle-ring system was found to have a 1 / 2 power dependence on the dimensionless liquid flow rate...|$|E

Application of a novel method of depositing thin organic and inorganic layer (superficial layer) onto a metal substrate utilizing <b>electro-spraying</b> (electrostatic atomization) method. The new achievements {{presented in this paper}} are aimed at application of this technology to functional layer deposition in micro-bearings. <b>Electro-spraying</b> is a low-energy process of liquid atomisation by means of electrical forces. <b>Electro-spraying</b> device consists of a capillary nozzle connected to a high electric potential whereas the substrate is grounded. The liquid flowing out the nozzle is subjected to an electrical stress, and fine droplets are generated from the meniscus or the jet formed at the nozzle outlet. Depending on physical properties of the liquid to be sprayed and spraying conditions, the size of the droplets can be in the submicron size range. In the <b>electro-spraying</b> process, a solution or a suspension of a material to be deposited is atomised into droplets, which can be targeted onto a substrate to form a condensed product, for example a thin layer after solvent evaporation.

In medical applications, however, voltages as low as a few tens of volts are required. To this end, we prepared nanometer-thin dielectric elastomer layers. It is demonstrated that alternating current, <b>electro-spray</b> deposition allows for the fabrication of homogenous, flat, nanometer-thin polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films. The growth of the PDMS with average number molecular weights ranging from 800 to 62, 700 g/mol, at a constant flow rate of 267 nL/s, was in situ monitored by means of spectroscopic ellipsometry. The Cauchy layer model used for data interpretation may only be applied to flat PDMS layers. Thus, {{in the present study}} the droplet morphology was also determined by atomic force microscopy. Spectroscopic ellipsometry does allow for the qualitative determination of the thin film morphology. However, for high molecular weight polymers the precise measurement during deposition is challenging.

40|$|The salient {{feature of}} a {{supercapacitor}} {{is its ability}} to deliver much higher power density than a battery. A hierarchical design and a cost-effective approach to fabricate high performance supercapacitors using functional carbon nano-particles is reported. A special arc synthesis method is used to produce amorphous/crystalline composite with nitrogen and boron co-doped high charge density carbon nanoparticles. Upon etch removal of the amorphous phase in the composite nanoparticle, a crystalline carbon framework emerges, consisting of a mixture of nano-graphitic sheets mostly in the middle and single nanohorns distributed around the surface of the nanoparticle. These nanoparticles have large internal/external surfaces with subnano channels and sharp nano-tips for high speed charge transport and local charge accumulation. To deliver high power density, the internal resistance of the device is reduced by assembling the nanoparticles via <b>electro-spraying</b> and compacting them into dense films (without any binder) under 700 MPa of pressure before supercapacitor assembly.

SWCNT coated electrodes were then prepared from the SWCNT aqueous suspensions using various methods to create uniform nanoporous networks of SWCNTs on various substrates {{and stainless steel}} (SST) current collectors for use as ultracapacitor electrodes. Drop coating, high voltage <b>electro-spraying</b> (HVES), inkjet printing, and electrophoretic deposition (EPD) methods were evaluated. Optical and scanning electron microscope images were {{used to evaluate the}} SWCNT dispersion quality of the various electrodes. Ultimately an EPD process was established which reliably produced uniform SWCNT nanoporous networks on SST substrates. The prepared SWCNT coated electrodes were characterized using cyclic voltammetry and their capacitance was determined. A correlation between extended EPD processing times, EPD processing temperatures, and electrode capacitance was quantified. Optimum EPD processing occurs where linear capacitance gains were observed for processing times less than 10 minutes. At processing times between 10 – 60 minutes a non-linear relationship demonstrated diminishing capacitance gains with extended EPD processing times. Likewise, optimum EPD processing occurs when the processing temperature of the SWCNT suspension is raised above room temperature. At processing temperatures from 45 °C to 60 °C an increase in capacitance was observed over the room temperature (22 °C) electrodes processed for the same durations. Conversely, for processing temperatures less than room temperature, at 5 °C, a decrease in capacitance was observed. It was also observed that SWCNT electrodes processed at 60 °C processing temperatures resulted in 4 times the capacitance of 5 °C electrodes for the same processing times, when the durations were 8 minutes or less. For samples with raised processing temperatures the time dependent capacitance gains were observed to be significantly diminished beyond 10 minute processing times. The SWCNT network thickness was also correlated to EPD processing temperature and capacitance. A linear relationship was identified between the SWCNT network thickness and the capacitance of the electrode. It was also observed that elevated processing temperatures increase the EPD deposition rate of SWCNTs, produce thicker SWCNT networks, and thus create electrodes with higher capacitance than electrodes processed at lower EPD processing temperatures. EPD of SWCNTs was demonstrated in this work to be an effective method for the fabrication of SWCNT ultracapacitor electrodes. Characterization of the process determined that optimal EPD processing occurs within the first 10 minutes of processing time and that elevated processing temperatures yield higher SWCNT deposition rates and higher capacitance values. In this work the addition of SWCNT nanoporous networks to SST electrodes resulted in increases in capacitance of up to 398 times the capacitance of the uncoated SST electrodes yielding a single 1 cm 2 electrode with a capacitance of 91 mF and representing an estimated specific capacitance for the processed SWCNT material of 45. 78 F/g...|$|E

Practical considerations are discussed with respect to methods of sampling, storage, and lipid extraction of red blood cells. The chapter describes the capabilities of a direct infusion of raw lipid extracts in the <b>electro-spray</b> ionization source compared with the more sophisticated method of high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with hybrid tandem {{mass spectrometry}}. Both methods have been evaluated and have been shown to be suitable for diagnosis and/or monitoring for a variety of human disorders...|$|R
