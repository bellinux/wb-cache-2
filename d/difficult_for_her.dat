5|$|Neuner later {{revealed}} {{that due to}} public expectations and constant media attention, the 2008–09 season had been extremely <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> psychologically, and she even briefly contemplated retirement.

5|$|Although she {{appeared}} {{on television and}} in dramatic roles, her career petered out in the late 1950s, as complications from her diabetes made it increasingly <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to work. Her final stage appearance was in a 1958 off-Broadway production of Jean Cocteau's 1934 play, The Infernal Machine, appearing alongside John Kerr and June Havoc.|$|E

She has stated that the transition was <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> due to the great depth of goalkeepers already with the {{national team}}, noting she often took the back seat to more experienced players, which affected her confidence.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{focuses on}} the death of Rudy's pet goldfish, which was {{difficult}} to explain to her and <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to deal with. The episode was a critical and commercial success, achieving both high ratings and positive critical feedback. Its viewer ratings placed it third for the opening week of the 1984–85 United States network television season and it earned Primetime Emmy Award and Writers Guild Award nominations for its writing.|$|E
5|$|At first Catherine {{kept the}} nine-year-old king, who cried at his coronation, close to her, and slept in his chamber. She presided over his council, decided policy, and {{controlled}} state business and patronage. However, {{she was never}} {{in a position to}} control the country as a whole, which was on the brink of civil war. In many parts of France the rule of nobles held sway rather than that of the crown. The challenges Catherine faced were complex and in some ways <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to comprehend as a foreigner.|$|E

50|$|Murdoch {{spent the}} years from 1929 to 1933 in London, {{compiling}} travel albums of her black-and-while photographs. These were <b>difficult</b> times <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> It is said {{the members of the}} Royal Photographic Society organised a collection to help <b>her</b> pay <b>for</b> <b>her</b> passage back to Boston. She was also made an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society in 1934, relieving her of further fees.|$|R
5|$|Jose Sarria's mother {{continued}} {{to work for the}} Jost family but it became increasingly <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to fulfil her job responsibilities and care for an infant. Maria made arrangements for him to be raised by another couple, Jesserina and Charles Millen. Jesserina had recently lost her youngest child to diphtheria and suffered severe depression. Her doctor suggested she take in another child to raise and after meeting with her Maria agreed to let her raise José. José came to consider the Millens and their children to be his second family. Maria bought a house and moved the Millens and José into it.|$|E
5|$|Born on 16 November 1945 in Brussels, van Hamel was the {{youngest}} of three siblings of Dutch parents. Her father, Diederik (Dick) Alfred van Hamel, was a diplomat stationed in Copenhagen. Her mother, Manette van Hamel (née Cramer), born in 1913 in Deventer, was a music teacher and violinist who played in a string quartet. Martine van Hamel began ballet lessons at the age of four in Copenhagen where it was common for children to study ballet. As a diplomat, her father was routinely stationed in different countries such as Denmark, the Netherlands, and Indonesia. It was <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to find teachers but she took lessons when possible. While her father was stationed in Caracas, Venezuela, van Hamel, then age ten, took classes with Henry Danton from The Royal Ballet. Danton frequently guest taught at the National Ballet of Venezuela. In 1958, she moved to Canada to study at Canada's National Ballet School with Betty Oliphant.|$|E
5|$|Morsell {{found it}} {{challenging}} to film a scene {{near the end}} of the game, in which Adrienne is pleading with Don while getting strapped into the chair with a guillotine overhead. Several different versions of the scene had to be filmed, and Morsell said it was <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to work up the genuine emotion she needed take after take. The torture devices featured in the game were scale models made by local craftsmen. During one scene, the mansion roof starts to collapse, causing beams and chunks of debris to fall around the actors. To achieve this, the crew built lightweight beams out of hollow cardboard, which had to fall in the correct sequence. In another scene, Adrienne crawls along a water pipe that breaks. To film the scene without damaging equipment, the crew built a giant plastic box with a plastic tray underneath for the shoot. Three hoses ran through the pipe so water would spray in multiple directions.|$|E

Benner decided to become a nurse while working in a hospital admitting department during college.|$|R
5|$|Neuner {{went into}} her first Winter Olympics in Vancouver with the {{declared}} aim of winning a gold medal. On 13 February 2010, she participated in the opening sprint, which was contested at Whistler Olympic Park in rainy conditions. With one shooting error, Neuner claimed the silver medal, finishing 1.5seconds behind Slovakia's Anastasiya Kuzmina. She uncharacteristically lost five seconds against the unheralded Slovak on the cross-country course, which led to speculation of inferior ski preparation in the German media. Three days later, Neuner won gold in the subsequent pursuit race. Despite missing two targets in the standing position, she beat sprint winner Kuzmina by 12.3seconds. In her third Olympic event, she finished tenth in the individual. She had three shooting mistakes and said it had been <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to immediately get her concentration back after winning her first gold medal. On 21 February 2010, Neuner claimed her second gold of the Games in the mass start. After missing two targets, she had been trailing {{by as much as}} 29seconds, but she pushed the pace and a clean final standing shoot allowed her to overtake Russia's Olga Zaitseva on the last lap. After the race, Neuner made the announcement not to participate in the relay, citing mental exhaustion and her desire to give all of her team mates the chance to win a medal. Her withdrawal allowed her friend Martina Beck a start in her last Olympic Games. Neuner was Germany's most successful athlete in Vancouver and was chosen to carry the German flag at the closing ceremony.|$|E

Two collections of poetry were published: Light in 1981 and Holding the Golden Apple in 1991.|$|E
60|$|At {{last she}} {{determined}} {{that she would}} {{write a letter to}} M. Urmand, and show a copy of the letter to her uncle when the post should have taken it so far out of Granpere on its way to Basle, as to make it impossible that her uncle should recall it. Much of the day after George's departure, and much of the night, was spent in the preparation of this letter. Marie Bromar was not so well practised in the writing of letters as will be the majority of the young ladies who may, perhaps, read her history. It was a <b>difficult</b> thing <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to begin the letter, and a <b>difficult</b> thing <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to bring it to its end. But the letter was written and sent. The post left Granpere at about eight in the morning, taking all letters by way of Remiremont; and on the day following George's departure, the post took Marie Bromar's letter to M. Urmand.|$|R

50|$|Juliana Maria was {{personally}} described as good-looking and sensible, but {{the marriage was}} not popular in Denmark, where it was considered {{to have taken place}} too soon after the death of her predecessor, the popular former queen Louise, and it was a <b>difficult</b> task <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to replace her popular predecessor. She had several stepchildren by marriage, but she was given no influence over their upbringing.|$|R
25|$|As {{they were}} getting ready to move Mrs. White learned she was pregnant, and as the early months were <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> it was decided that she would remain in Newark until after the baby was born. In September White moved to New York with his two sons and his widowed mother, who cared for the boys until their mother arrived. Their third son, Clarence Hudson White, Jr., was born in January, 1907. Due to the {{difficulty}} of the pregnancy Mrs. White remained in Newark until June of that year.|$|E
25|$|Kelly faced several {{difficult}} issues and obstacles, {{often with the}} assistance of loved ones, including her occasionally difficult home life, being trapped in a fire, being tricked into joining a cult, and becoming temporarily addicted to cocaine. In addition to many other matters, she endured getting amnesia, shooting her rapist in self-defense, becoming unexpectedly pregnant and having a miscarriage, and learning that it would be <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to have children because of a condition called endometriosis. In overcoming these matters, she was able to become a better person and help others.|$|E
25|$|Muriel {{undertook}} {{studies at}} Montreal's McGill University {{with the help}} of a small college bursary and money from her Aunt Abbie. She was enrolled in the university's Bachelor of Arts program and in her graduating year, took the education courses required to qualify for a high school teaching diploma. To practice teaching in front of a classroom full of children as well as her fellow education students was especially <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> but Muriel hid her fear so well that the supervising professor praised her apparent lack of nervousness. She also tried to overcome her shyness by entering a public speaking contest and volunteering to take minutes at student meetings.|$|E

25|$|This {{first school}} proves <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> Laura must board with the Brewsters in their two-room claim shanty, {{sleeping}} on their sofa. The Brewsters are an unhappy family and Laura is deeply uncomfortable observing the way {{husband and wife}} quarrel. In one particularly unsettling incident, she wakes in the night to see Mrs Brewster standing over her husband with a knife. It's a bitterly cold winter, and neither the claim shanty or the school house can be heated adequately. The children she is teaching, {{some of whom are}} older than she is herself, test her skills as a teacher. Laura grows more self-assured through the term, and successfully completes the two-month term.|$|E
25|$|While {{the rate}} of {{domestic}} violence among immigrant groups does not differ {{from that of the}} general population, immigrant victims of domestic violence may face additional challenges. While victims can be of either gender, women may be especially vulnerable. The process of immigrating to another country and adjusting to American culture can be stressful, increasing the likelihood of domestic violence. Factors such as limited English language ability, legal status, and lack of social ties may create additional barriers for those trying to escape such situations. Even when a woman does have access to social services that could help her escape an abusive situation, cultural norms may make it <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to leave. If a woman decides to leave an abusive spouse she may run the risk of social ostracism and of bringing shame to her family. Thus, a woman may choose to stay and suffer abuse rather than face the social consequences of leaving her husband.|$|E
25|$|Winifred Banks – {{the wife}} of George Banks, and mother to Jane and Michael. In the musical and film, she is {{presented}} as a society woman. In the film, she is a suffragette and involved in social causes. In the musical, she is a former actress. Her family and maiden name are not mentioned, however in the books, she has two aunts that are mentioned, Aunt Flossie and Aunt Caroline. In the musical, Winifred is shown to be confused and overwhelmed with her family and her role in it. It is hinted that she did not grow up in the same strict manor as her husband, perhaps she did not even have a nanny as a child, and is not from this area, which makes it <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to connect and make friends. In the original books, she has five children instead of two, including the twins, John and Barbara, and later a baby, Annabel.|$|E
