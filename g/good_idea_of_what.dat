This came about after Kristian Hellström of the Swedish Olympic Committee wrote to the {{government}}s of Japan and China to ask if they were going to send teams to the 1912 Olympics. The Japanese government did not want to embarrass itself on an international stage by saying no, so the Ministry of Education was told to look into this. The Ministry logically turned to Kanō, who was a physical educator with recent experience in Europe. Kanō agreed to represent Japan at the International Olympics Committee, and, after talking to the French ambassador to Japan and reading pamphlets sent by the Swedes, developed, in his words, [...] "a fairly <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the Olympic Games were." ...|$|E

50|$|Chris Kennedy {{made the}} movie shortly after leaving film school:I had an Irish friend who {{considered}} himself {{a bit of}} a film producer and I considered myself a film writer and director and producer, so I went to the bank and talked them into giving us the money to make Glass, on the understanding that {{we would be able to}} recoup the money... They didn't know any better and I didn't know any better. So we went ahead and made the film. Essentially Glass was made with a view to selling it effectively. It was made to be something that you could turn the sound off in Iceland and still get a pretty <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what's</b> going on. Apart from other things, apart from being a terrific learning curve for me, it was really making movies on the job without ever having made a movie. No-one at the top end of the cast or crew had ever made a feature film before, and I was the blind leading the blind.|$|R

Pandering to the 'Cool, let's see that again' crowd has made Lionsgate rich but done nothing for this unendurable endurance contest of this long-enduring film franchise". [...] Mike Hale of The New York Times called the film the most [...] "straightforward" [...] of the series and the [...] "most consistently (though not inventively) violent". He ended his review saying, [...] "If you see the film in a theater equipped with RealD 3D and Dolby sound, you'll come away with a pretty <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> it would feel like to have flying body parts hit you in the face".|$|E

However the character from Fantasia which Tytla {{is better known}} for is Chernabog, {{his own version of}} Crnobog the Black God, from the [...] "Night on Bald Mountain" [...] sequence. It is often said that Chernabog was based on actor Bela Lugosi, and Walt did bring him in to do live action reference for the character. However, Bill already had a pretty <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he wanted to do and did not like Bela's interpretation of the character. Instead he had Wilfred Jackson (who is credited for the music of Steamboat Willie) act out the part for him, and that is what he used as live action reference.|$|E
2500|$|Roadside cycle {{tracks in}} Copenhagen are {{generally}} one-directional (see Google Maps' orthophotos), with one cycle track {{on each side}} of street flowing the same direction as motortraffic. Legally, the minimum width is , but in practice most cycle tracks are at least , preferably , and very busy stretches of cycle tracks can be [...] wide. Cycle tracks in Copenhagen are separated from car lanes by a [...] high stone curb and the sidewalk by another [...] curb. They are by and large of a uniform design, in order to give cyclists a <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> any particular route will look like. Where roadside parking is available cycle tracks run {{on the inside of the}} row of parked cars, between parking and the sidewalk, essentially using parked cars as a separation barrier between bicycles and vehicle traffic. As most cars are single occupancy, this also aids to prevent dooring accidents, as the driver exits the car on the opposite side of the cycle track.|$|E

5000|$|This Condamine River seep {{was brought}} to the {{forefront}} of media attention by New South Wales Greens MP Jeremy Buckingham, in which he allegedly set alight the methane gas bubbling from the riverbed. He also mentions [...] "hydraulic fracturing" [...] as likely to be contributing to the problem, but to date there is no direct link. Origin Energy, the company whom owns a majority of the coal seam gas wells in the Condamine area, refutes the claim, with a spokesperson stating that the nearest drilling projects were located several kilometers away from the river. They conceded, however, that [...] "we are starting to see more bubbles than there used to be", which raises further questions of the gas company. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) commented that [...] "we have a pretty <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what’s</b> going on, {{but it is hard to}} be completely definitive as the gas is emanating from underground", and that [...] "the methane gas emanating from the Condamine River in Queensland poses no environmental impact." ...|$|R
40|$|Agriculture is {{the result}} of a balance between soil, climate, plants and {{cropping}} techniques applied by the farmers. Once one of those elements, in this case the climate, is perceptibly modified in a sustainable way, it is important that the other elements are also modified to respect the balance. To adapt to climate change farmers can modify their strategic or tactic decisions. But the very first point is to have <b>good</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> are to be expected in terms of climate modifications and their agronomic consequences: acceleration of crop cycles, increase of summer droughts and increase in inter-season and inter-annual variability. Concerning strategic choices, one must not expect revolution and climate change will not deeply modify cropping systems. Yet rainfed crops will be more difficult in the south while summer crops and crop successions will become easier in the north. Escape strategies in terms of crop and genotype choices could be advantageous. An important point of discussion is about sowing dates. If they could theoretically be advanced for summer crops, the soil water status may not be adequate for allowing farmers to enter fields with heavy machines. It is also because of soil dryness that winter crops sowing should be delayed. In order to provide the farmers with more quantified results an ANR project, CLIMATOR, is proceeding...|$|R

In the Hercule Poirot novel The Clocks, the pseudonymous secret agent Colin Lamb is heavily implied to be the son of the now-retired Battle.|$|R
30|$|Hilary {{also showed}} {{significant}} shifts toward more student-centered responses on several questions (Figs.  2 and 3). During the initial interview, Hilary described how she assessed student understanding, “There {{are always the}} assessments, and with assessments I do try {{to mix it up}} a little bit…” This suggests a focus on measures given by the instructor. She went on to say, “If they actually come to a…some kind of solution [correct] to this problem…” and here she was not only focusing on assessments but on the correct solutions to those assessments to gauge understanding. Together, these two responses align with a transitional pedagogical belief system. However, in the post-development interview Hilary’s response shifted to a more student-centered view, stating “when they {{can come up with a}} very…an original idea or thought” and “when they [students] are getting the information and maybe making comments on how this is useful or important to them…” The question about determining what to teach in class received the most traditional responses (Fig.  4). During her initial pre-development interview, Hilary responded in an instructor-centered way where she stated “time is always a constraint…I do have topics that I want to make sure I cover over the course of the semester. Her response on the post-development interview shifted toward student-centered where she stated that she chooses topics “that they can internalize and see the importance of those things, whether you are a geologist, a teacher, or construction worker things that are going to affect their everyday life”. This response showed a student-centered focus on science literacy and she elaborated further when asked why she chooses topics in this way “It’s not because they are students, but because they are humans”. When asked during the pre-development interview how she assesses learning in the class, Hilary stated “I kind of have these bigger assessments at the end of three or four chapters”. Initially, she has an instructor-centered focus on summative assessments given after she covered topics in class. This view changed during the post-development interview where she responded in a more student-centered manner by stating that she assessed learning by “the discussions really, again they [students] give me a very <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what’s</b> going on during a week to week basis”. She was focusing on interactions among students to determine if learning occurred and she was continually doing this as opposed to focusing on summative assessments given after the fact.|$|R
40|$|The <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> using {{values as}} a means of guiding our {{research}} decisions and judging the validity of our claims of knowledge is well established in literature on the self-reflective genre of action research. Values in action research should always result in virtuous behaviour – to promote the general social <b>good.</b> However, <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> constitutes the social good may differ from context to context. This article problematises the notion that ‘good’ values lead to ‘good’ action. Presenting one research project as a case study, I show that the articulation of values does not always result in what I, as a researcher and White, middle-class woman, would recognise as health-promoting action. Yet, the participants view such behaviour as a legitimate means to improve their quality of life, {{at least in the short}} term. First, I describe the social and cultural context of the research, before highlighting some value conflicts that emerged, as the participants and I critically reflected on our understanding of more equal and healthy gender relations. It is important to expose such conflicting value interpretations through critical self-reflection, so that researchers and participants can work towards a deeper mutual understanding of how to best address complex social issues such as gender relations in specific social contexts.

50|$|A mixed-breed dog who {{belongs to}} Suguri. His {{grandfather}} (whose collar Suguri wears around her neck) saved Suguri {{when she was}} kidnapped as a child. Suguri considers Lupin to be her alter ego and is unable to function without him near her. He {{has the ability to}} unlock his kennel door and a habit of coming down into the shop when it's crowded, much to Teppei's annoyance. Suguri named him after the anime character Lupin III since like his namesake, Lupin seems to have an attraction for females, be they dog or human. He displays some interesting behaviors, including sometimes (and only sometimes) being able to understand commands that he's been never taught, being able to tell if a person is trustworthy or not, and humorously almost always rolling over in submission to any dogs that seem powerful or dominant, whether they truly be aggressive or not. Lupin is of mixed breeds, however he seems to be mostly, if not completely, made up of dog breeds from the Spitz family. Ryusuke even thought he was a Kishu Inu when he first met him. Suguri and Kim hope to breed him with Chanta, going by the logic that since she's a pure Shiba Inu, and Lupin is a mix of other native Japanese dog breeds, they will have a <b>good</b> general <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the puppies will look like. In volume 15 of the manga, parts of Lupin's bloodline were revealed. His grandfather Lupin was a mix, and his grandmother was a pedigree German Shepherd. So, Lupin's father is 50% German Shepherd and 50% Mutt. Lupin's mother is a Kishu Inu mix and her mother is thought to be a pure breed Kishu with no health problems. Therefore, Lupin is 25% German Shepherd, 37.5% Kishu Inu, and 37.5% mix of other native Japanese breeds.|$|R
