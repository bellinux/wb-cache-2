5|$|Alder {{was born}} September 17, 1773, in Gloucester, New Jersey, to Bartholomew Alder and Hannah Worthington. The family moved in 1775 to Wythe County, Virginia, where Alder's father died {{about a year}} later. In May 1782, Jonathan, at eight years old, was sent out with his brother <b>David</b> <b>to</b> search {{for a couple of}} horses that ran away. They were {{attacked}} by a small group of Shawnee Indians from Ohio. David saw the Indians first and tried to escape, but he was chased down, killed, and later scalped. The Indian group also captured Alder's neighbor, Mrs. Martin, and her young child.|$|E

5|$|Lewis and Audrey {{decide to}} go on holiday {{together}} and Lewis offers to pay for himself. Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly wrote that Lewis' renewed relationship with Audrey and their plans {{to go on a}} round-the-world cruise would cause a feud between her and David. Audrey's money is tied up in the salon, so she asks <b>David</b> <b>to</b> sign it back to her so she can pay for the holiday. However, David refuses to sign the salon back as he thinks Lewis might be planning another fraud. Kilkelly said Lewis tries to play peacemaker and suggests postponing the trip until he can save the money himself, but Audrey insists David will co-operate and she tears up their contract.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{publication}} of Summer Cooking, David was wooed away from her regular column in Harpers by Vogue magazine, which offered her more money and more prominence—a full central page with a continuing column following, and a full page photograph. The new contract meant she also wrote for Vogues sister magazine House & Garden. Audrey Withers, the editor of Vogue, wanted <b>David</b> <b>to</b> write more personal columns than she had done for Harper's, and paid her £20 a month for food ingredients {{and from time to time}} £100 for research trips to France.|$|E
5|$|The Empire of Trebizond, {{which had}} split {{away from the}} Byzantine Empire just weeks before Constantinople {{was taken by the}} Crusaders in 1204, became the last remnant and last de facto {{successor}} state to the Byzantine Empire. Efforts by the Emperor <b>David</b> <b>to</b> recruit European powers for an anti-Ottoman crusade provoked war between the Ottomans and Trebizond in the summer of 1461. After a month-long siege, David surrendered the city of Trebizond on 14 August 1461. The Empire of Trebizond's Crimean principality, the Principality of Theodoro (part of the Perateia), lasted another 14 years, falling to the Ottomans in December 1475.|$|E

5|$|These suggest that, {{after the}} sacking of Jerusalem by AntiochusIV in 168BCE, {{at least part}} of the City of <b>David</b> <b>to</b> the south of the Temple Mount was rebuilt as a {{fortified}} Hellenistic quarter of Jerusalem. More than a citadel, it was a Macedonian colony where Jewish renegades and supporters of the new regime lived. This is also supported by archaeological evidence, including Rhodian amphorae handles and 18 box graves found on the eastern slope of the City of David. The latter are dated to the early 2nd century CE, and are uncharacteristic of Second Temple era Jewish burial practices, yet similar to other known Hellenistic graveyards such as the one in Acre (Ptolemais).|$|E
5|$|Veronica Nicholson, {{a friend}} with {{connections}} in the publishing trade, persuaded <b>David</b> <b>to</b> continue writing, with the aim that she write a book. She showed some of David's work to Anne Scott-James, {{the editor of the}} British magazine Harper's Bazaar, who thought the writing showed a widely travelled person with an independent mind. She offered David a contract, and David's work began appearing in the publication from March 1949.|$|E
5|$|A Book of Mediterranean Food was {{successful}} enough for Lehmann to commission <b>David</b> <b>to</b> write a sequel, {{to show the}} dishes of rural France. This was French Country Cooking, which David finished writing in October 1950. Minton was employed to illustrate the work, and David gave him detailed instructions about the type of drawings; she was more pleased with them than those for her first work. Despite their difficult relationship, David dedicated the book to her mother. Before the book was published, David left England to live {{for a short time}} in France. She was motivated by a desire to gain a wider knowledge of life in the French countryside, and to put distance between her and her husband. She left London in March 1951 for Ménerbes, Provence. She spent three months in Provence; although the weather was initially cold and wet, it soon turned warmer and she enjoyed herself so much that she considered buying a house there. In June 1951 she left Ménerbes and travelled to the island of Capri to visit Norman Douglas. When she left in late August, she toured briefly around the Italian Riviera researching for an article for Go, before returning to London.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the virtual}} {{intelligence}} {{is kept in}} lockdown in another research station, Archers tells Shepard that he/she needs to manually override security from two other facilities {{to gain access to}} it and shut it down. Once the station where the virtual intelligence is contained has been unlocked, Shepards proceeds to the main server room. Shepard eventually accesses a terminal to cut all access to the outside world, but in the process the virus infects Shepard's cybernetic implants. Shepard awakens in a virtual reality, and heads to the central core room, where he finds that Archer had experimented on David in an attempt to control the geth. Shepard manages to defeat the virtual intelligence as it attempts to establish an upload link to the Normandy. Afterwards, David is shown in the core tied up to tubes in his arms and mouth, begging for help. Archer comes and argues for Shepard to keep the experiment going. Shepard is then given the option to either take <b>David</b> <b>to</b> a specialized academy or leave him at the station with his brother.|$|E
5|$|Dallas {{delivers}} Leeloo to Cornelius and his apprentice, David, whereupon it {{is revealed}} {{that she is}} the Fifth Element. Cornelius learns from her that the element stones were not on the Mondoshawans' ship, as they entrusted the stones to the alien Diva Plavalaguna, an opera singer. Zorg kills many of the Mangalores because of their failure to obtain the stones, but their surviving compatriots determine to seize the artifacts in revenge. Upon learning from the Mondoshawans that the stones are in Plavalaguna's possession, General Munro, Dallas' former superior, recommissions Dallas and orders him to travel undercover to the planet Fhloston to meet Plavalaguna on a luxury cruise; Dallas takes Leeloo with him. Meanwhile, Cornelius instructs <b>David</b> <b>to</b> prepare the temple designed to house the stones, then stows away on the space plane transporting Dallas to the cruise liner.|$|E
5|$|Lewis attends court, {{where he}} is found guilty and sentenced to perform forty hours {{community}} service. While dining at The Bistro, Lewis charms a food critic and Nick Tilsley offers him a two-week trial as head waiter. Gail disapproves but Audrey defends Lewis and he later buys Audrey a bracelet as a gift of thanks. When Nick finds some money missing from the till, he and Gail believe Lewis took it. Audrey also doubts Lewis but when she learns that Eva Price (Catherine Tyldesley) took the money, she tries unsuccessfully to stop Lewis from leaving. Lewis returns for his wages and tells Nick that his community service has finished and he is leaving for good. Audrey arrives to see Lewis, asks him to stay and professes her love for him. They spend the night together at Audrey's house and agree to keep their relationship secret. Once David and Gail find out about their relationship, Audrey and Lewis make it public. Lewis suggests they go on holiday together to the Mediterranean and Audrey agrees. She asks <b>David</b> <b>to</b> sign her salon back to her so she can {{help pay for the}} holiday, but he refuses.|$|E

50|$|In 1536 the {{administration}} of Wales was re-organised, and the border between Herefordshire and Wales took more or less its present form, with the county of Herefordshire assimilating the Welsh territory of Ewyas Lacy. The Llanthony valley, or Vale of Ewyas, {{became part of the}} hundred of Abergavenny, within Monmouthshire. In 1852 the Parishes of Clodock with Longtown, Michaelchurch Escley, Craswall, St Margarets, Ewyas Harold, Rowlestone, Llancillo, Walterstone, Dulas and Llanveynoe were transferred from the diocese of St <b>David's</b> <b>to</b> that of Hereford. To the west of Hatterall Ridge, the other old parishes of Ewyas - Llanthony, Cwmyoy and Oldcastle - were transferred from St <b>David's</b> <b>to</b> the diocese of Llandaff.|$|R
5|$|Rachel, who is {{spending}} {{most of her time}} in her hotel room on account of her pregnancy, receives a visit from her expatriated lesbian sister Lucy (Susannah Doyle). Lucy tells Rachel that she has been sleeping around with men {{in order to have a}} child. When Adam learns of this, he suggests to Lucy that she use some of his banked sperm. They broach the idea to Rachel, who is disgusted at the thought of her husband having a baby with her sister and forbids it from going ahead. Meanwhile, Karen finally assures David that the animosity between them caused by his extramarital affair is in the past. She emails Mark Cubitt (Sean Pertwee), a man she has been having an affair with in England, to tell him their fling is over. Mark arrives at her apartment the next morning and spends the day with her after David cancels a visit to an art gallery with her. He convinces her that David is still the same insensitive man that he has always been. The next day, Karen tells Rachel that she will leave <b>David</b> <b>to</b> be with Mark.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Soviet proposal, Macmillan met with Eisenhower at Camp <b>David</b> <b>to</b> devise a response. The Anglo-American counterproposal agreed to ban small {{underground}} tests (those under magnitude 4.75) {{on a temporary}} basis (a duration of roughly 1 year, versus the Soviet proposal of 4–5 years), but this could only happen after verifiable tests had been banned and a seismic research group (the Seismic Research Program Advisory Group) convened. The Soviet Union responded positively to the counterproposal and the research group convened on 11 May 1960. The Soviet Union also offered to keep an underground ban out of the treaty under negotiation. In May 1960, there were high hopes that an agreement would be reached at an upcoming summit of Eisenhower, Khrushchev, Macmillan, and Charles de Gaulle of France in Paris.|$|E
5|$|The Seinfeld Chronicles {{was written}} as the pilot {{for the show}} that would {{eventually}} be called Seinfeld, though earlier versions of the script would refer to the program as Stand Up and The Jerry Seinfeld Show. The idea for the show started on November 2, 1988, after NBC executives had approached comedian Jerry Seinfeld to do a project with the network, upon a suggestion by George Shapiro, Seinfeld's manager at the time. Seinfeld enlisted fellow comedian Larry <b>David</b> <b>to</b> help him develop it, and they wrote a concept for a special about where comedians get their material. However, upon further discussion, Seinfeld felt that the concept could not be sustained for 90 minutes, upon which the two decided that the project {{was to become a}} pilot for a TV-series, rather than a special. Developed by NBC executive Rick Ludwin, and produced by Castle Rock Entertainment, it was a mix of Seinfeld's stand-up comedy routines and idiosyncratic, conversational scenes focusing on mundane aspects of everyday life.|$|E
