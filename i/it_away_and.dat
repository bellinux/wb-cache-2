5|$|Water is the {{dominant}} force in the Everglades, shaping the land, vegetation, and animal life in South Florida. Starting at the last glacial maximum, 21,000 years ago, continental ice sheets retreated and sea levels rose. This submerged portions of the Florida peninsula and caused the water table to rise. Fresh water saturated the limestone that underlies the Everglades, eroding some of <b>it</b> <b>away,</b> <b>and</b> created springs and sinkholes. The abundance of fresh water allowed new vegetation to take root, and formed convective thunderstorms over the land through evaporation.|$|E
5|$|According to Filitti, the war {{spelled out}} {{the end of}} Romania's aristocratic order, leaving the country prey to the nouveaux riches and the neo-Jacobins. As the Conservative Party itself {{collapsed}} into obscurity, he remained largely {{cut off from the}} outside world, and rejected many of the recent innovations. Reportedly, he wrote all his books and articles in dip pen, and never watched a motion picture. After 1919, he had to recover from financial ruin, having entrusted the bulk of his assets (what had not been lost in the war) to a broker, who gambled <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>and</b> then committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{comes across}} an {{advertisement}} {{in the newspaper}} for a free trampoline. He rushes to the address from the advertisement, where Krusty is giving <b>it</b> <b>away,</b> <b>and</b> brings it home. Bart and Lisa are thrilled, but Marge {{is concerned about the}} potential dangers. However, Homer brushes aside her worries; he has grand plans of building a theme park in their backyard, and decides to charge others a fee to use the trampoline. Inevitably, however, people begin to get injured, and Homer accepts Marge's advice {{to get rid of the}} trampoline. After failing at his various attempts to do so, Bart steps in to help, by chaining the trampoline to a pole and waiting for Snake to break the chain and steal it for himself.|$|E

5|$|Maryland next {{traveled}} to South Carolina {{to face a}} team coming off of a four-game winning streak. Ralph Felton scored first to cap a long drive with a short rush. In the next series, the Gamecocks punted <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>and</b> the ball was returned by Hanulak 35 yards for a touchdown. In the second quarter, South Carolina recovered a Maryland fumble on the Terrapins' 14-yard line. In three plays, Maryland had pushed {{them back to the}} 32-yard line before South Carolina finally scored. With South Carolina held to 37 rushing yards the final result was 24–6.|$|E

25|$|According to The Clan Ranald Bard, on 3 April 1746, the Royal Navy ship Baltimore arrived, {{and demanded}} (under threat of force) {{to be given}} the meat from the best cattle on the Island; 4 days later, {{complaining}} that the meat was rotten, the sailors threw <b>it</b> <b>away,</b> <b>and</b> slaughtered 60 cattle themselves. The Bard {{goes on to say that}} 12 days later, the Royal Navy ship Commodore arrived, and after receiving warning (from one of the sailors) about the lecherous intentions of the sailors, the women of Canna fled into the countryside and caves, until they were certain that the ship had departed; one pregnant woman miscarried from spending so long in the cold, and died.|$|E

500|$|Seattle {{equalized}} in the 38thminute. Montero {{passed to}} Tyson Wahl, who crossed {{the ball into}} the 18-yard-box, where Crew goalkeeper Gruenebaum hesitated on how to handle the ball. He knocked <b>it</b> <b>away,</b> <b>and</b> it fell to Nathan Sturgis, who passed the ball between the legs of Gaven to find teammate Sanna Nyassi 18yards out. [...] Nyassi turned on the ball and shot it past Gruenebaum, who was still out of position. [...] Following the goal few scoring opportunities were created before halftime. [...] After one minute of stoppage time, the first half ended with a tie score, 1–1.|$|E
500|$|Between series one and two, Wood {{said she}} thought {{it was a mistake to}} do another As Seen On TV series, and had {{attempted}} to write a play instead: [...] "I've been seeking to branch out, but it hasn't happened. I wanted to do something different before I went back on TV." [...] However, she soon decided that the play was [...] "too Alan Ayckbourn", threw <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>and</b> began writing the second run instead. [...] She aimed to write 18 minutes of script a week. In the end it took six months to complete, an experience she did not enjoy. [...] "You pour everything you've got into one sketch and you don't ever want to write another - only you realise there are fifty-nine more to go before you've got enough for a series, it's torment".|$|E

500|$|On 4 March, Webster {{travelled}} to Hammersmith {{to see her}} old neighbours the Porters, {{whom she}} had not seen for six years, wearing Thomas' silk dress and carrying a Gladstone bag which she had filled with some of Thomas' remains. Webster introduced herself to the Porters as [...] "Mrs. Thomas". She claimed that, since last meeting the Porters, she had married, had a child, been widowed, and had been left a house in Richmond by an aunt. She invited Porter and his son Robert to the Oxford and Cambridge Arms pub in Barnes. Along the way, she disposed of the bag that she was carrying, probably by dropping it into the River Thames, while the Porters were inside the pub drinking. It was never recovered. Webster then asked young Robert Porter if he could help her carry a heavy box from 2 Mayfield Cottages to the station. As they crossed Richmond Bridge, Webster dropped the box into the Thames. She was able to explain <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>and</b> did not arouse Robert's suspicions.|$|E
500|$|Another {{instance}} of murder occurred on October 3, 1880, when Thomas Forrest stabbed Michael Carbis. Carbis, the foreman of the California mine, had fired Forrest {{the day before}} {{on account of his}} violent nature. The murder occurred near the Buckeye boarding house. Forrest initially had a pistol, but he put <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>and</b> drew a knife instead when he got within a few feet of Carbis. Carbis died soon after the stab wound was inflicted. Silver Reef's residents were angered by the murder and soon lynch threats were delivered. Forrest, who had been arrested soon after the murder had been committed, was transferred to the jail in St. George for his own safety. Prior to the moving of Forrest, a lynch mob gathered and followed the sheriff's escort to the St. George jail. Once there, they overpowered the sheriff, took Forrest out of his cell, and tried to hang him on a telegraph pole. When the pole broke, they took him to a cottonwood tree and hung him there. The residents of St. George were shocked at the sight of Forrest's hanging, and one man was reputed to have said, [...] "I have observed that tree growing there for the last 25 years. This is the first time I have ever seen it bearing fruit." ...|$|E
500|$|Pound taught Hemingway {{to write}} sparingly. Pound wrote {{to him that}} [...] "anything put {{on top of the}} subject is BAD... The subject is always {{interesting}} enough without blankets." [...] Hemingway would write in A Moveable Feast (published posthumously in 1964), [...] "If I started to write elaborately, like someone presenting or introducing something, I found that I could cut that scrollwork or ornament out and throw <b>it</b> <b>away</b> <b>and</b> start with the first true simple declarative sentence I had written." [...] In Our Time was written during the author's experimentation phase, his first attempts towards a minimalist style. The prose in [...] "Indian Camp" [...] and [...] "Big Two-Hearted River" [...] is sharper and more abstract than in other stories, and by employing simple sentences and diction– techniques he learned writing for newspapers– the prose is timeless with an almost mythic quality, explains Benson. The tightly compressed sentence structure emulates and reflects Pound's imagist style, bringing to prose narrative the stripped-down style Pound famously established in 1913 with poems such as [...] "In a Station of the Metro". Thomas Strychacz compares Hemingway's prose to Pound's poetry, writing, [...] "Hemingway's terse, tight-lipped, tightly wound fragments are equally extraordinary in their dramatic intensity." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{applying}} the strict construction standard to the sewer service exemption, {{the appellate court}} construed the exemption to include only its narrower and more common meaning applicable to sanitary sewerage. [...] Using similar reasoning, the appellate court also concluded that the stormwater drainage fee did not qualify under the water service exemption. [...] The court noted that the “average voter would envision ‘water service’ as the supply of water for personal, household, and commercial use, not a system or program that monitors storm water for pollutants, carries <b>it</b> <b>away,</b> <b>and</b> discharges it into the nearby creeks, river, and ocean.” ...|$|E

At the time of the Domesday survey in 1086, the manor of Hanyngedune was known; it was first named in 956, when King Eadwig gave <b>it</b> <b>away,</b> <b>and</b> the area it covered was identical to the later parish of Botolphs.|$|E
