40|$|Background. This study {{evaluated}} the relative efficacy of {{strategies for the}} prevention of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB) in adult intensive care units (ICUs). Methods. A systematic review and network meta-analysis was performed; searches of the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) included all randomized controlled trials and observational studies conducted in adult patients hospitalized in ICUs and evaluating standard care (STD), antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP), environmental cleaning (ENV), decolonization methods (DCL), or source control (SCT), simultaneously. The primary outcomes were MDR-GNB acquisition, colonization, and infection; secondary outcome was ICU mortality. Results. Of 3805 publications retrieved, 42 met inclusion criteria (5 randomized controlled trials and 37 observational studies), involving 62 068 patients (median age, 58. 8 years; median APACHE [Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation] II score, 18. 9). The majority of studies reported extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) -producing Enterobacteriaceae and MDR Acinetobacter baumannii. Compared with STD, a 4 -component strategy composed of STD, ASP, ENV, and SCT was the most <b>effective</b> <b>intervention</b> (<b>rate</b> ratio [RR], 0. 05 [95 % confidence interval {CI},. 01 -. 38]). When ENV was added to STD+ASP or SCT was added to STD+ENV, there was a significant reduction in the acquisition of MDR A. baumannii (RR, 0. 28 [95 % CI,. 18 -. 43] and 0. 48 [95 % CI,. 35 -. 66], respectively). Strategies with ASP as a core component showed a statistically significant reduction the acquisition of ESBLproducing Enterobacteriaceae (RR, 0. 28 [95 % CI,. 11 -. 69] for STD+ASP+ENV and 0. 23 [95 % CI,. 07 -. 80] for STD+ASP+DCL). Conclusions. A 4 -component strategy was the most effective intervention to prevent MDR-GNB acquisition. As some strategies were differential for certain bacteria, our study highlighted the need for further evaluation of the most effective prevention strategies...|$|E

40|$|To review Australian {{policies}} on active transport, defined as walking and cycling for utilitarian purposes. To estimate the potential health impact of achieving four active transport policy scenarios. A policy review was undertaken, using key words to search government websites. Potential health benefits were quantified using a cohort simulation Markov model to estimate obesity and transport injury-related {{health effects of}} an increase in active transport. Health adjusted life years (HALYs) gained and healthcare cost savings from diseases averted were estimated. Budget thresholds to achieve cost-effectiveness were estimated for each scenario. There is broad recognition of the health-related benefits of active transport from all levels of Australian government. Modelling results suggest significant health-related benefits of achieving increased prevalence of active transport. Total HALYs saved assuming a one-year effect ranged from 565 (95 %UI 173 - 985) to 12, 105 (95 %UI 4, 970 - 19, 707), with total healthcare costs averted ranging from $ 6. 6 M (95 %UI $ 1. 9 M- 11. 3 M) to $ 141. 2 M (95 %UI $ 53. 8 M- 227. 8 M). <b>Effective</b> <b>interventions</b> that improve <b>rates</b> of active transport may result in substantial healthcare-related cost savings through a decrease in conditions related to obesity.

40|$|Aim. To provide {{comprehensive}} {{evidence of}} the effect of interventions on early initiation, exclusive, continued and any breastfeeding rates when delivered in five settings: (i) Health systems and services (ii) Home and family environment (iii) Community environment (iv) Work environment (v) Policy environment or a combination of any of above. Methods. Of 23977 titles identified through a systematic literature search in PUBMED, Cochrane and CABI, 195 articles relevant to our objective, were included. We reported the pooled relative risk and corresponding 95 % confidence intervals as our outcome estimate. In cases of high heterogeneity, we explored its causes by subgroup analysis and meta-regression and applied random effects model. Results. Intervention delivery in combination of settings seemed to have higher improvements in breastfeeding rates. Greatest improvements in early initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding and continued breastfeeding rates, were seen when counselling or education were provided concurrently in home and community, health systems and community, health systems and home settings, respectively. Baby friendly hospital support at health system was the most <b>effective</b> <b>intervention</b> to improve <b>rates</b> of any breastfeeding. Conclusion. To promote breastfeeding, interventions should be delivered in a combination of settings by involving health systems, home and family and the community environment concurrently. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background Approximately {{half of the}} 33. 3 million HIV-infected persons {{worldwide}} {{are women}} of reproductive age, according to UNAIDS 1. An estimated 2. 5 million children are living with HIV, the majority of which are infected {{as a result of}} transmission from mothers to children during pregnancy, labour, delivery, or breastfeeding. The prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) has long been a focus of the global response to HIV/AIDS, particularly since 1998 when the positive results of both zidovudine (AZT) and single-dose nevirapine (sdNVP) clinical efficacy trials were first announced 2. Today, new perinatal HIV infections are rare in high-income countries as a result of <b>effective</b> PMTCT <b>interventions.</b> However, <b>rates</b> of new infections in resource-limited settings (RLS) remain unacceptably high 3.

40|$|Anxiety {{disorders}} represent one of {{the most}} common categories of psychopathology in children and adolescents. Apart from separation anxiety disorder, a well recognized problem of childhood, it is now widely accepted that generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, specific phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder and panic disorder all occur during the childhood and adolescent years. Numerous studies examining the nature and treatment of anxiety disorders have appeared during the recent years. Significant advances in this area include the investigation of pharmacological agents and development of <b>effective</b> psychosocial <b>interventions.</b> Prevalence <b>rates</b> for having at least one childhood anxiety disorder vary from 6 % to 20 % over several large epidemiological studies (Costello et. al., 2004).

40|$|During the 1918 {{influenza}} pandemic, the U. S., unlike Europe, put considerable {{effort into}} public health interventions. There was also more geographic {{variation in the}} autumn wave of the pandemic in the U. S. compared with Europe, with some cities seeing only a single large peak in mortality and others seeing double-peaked epidemics. Here we examine whether differences in the public health measures adopted by different cities can explain the variation in epidemic patterns and overall mortality observed. We show that city-specific per-capita excess mortality in 1918 was significantly correlated with 1917 per-capita mortality, indicating some intrinsic variation in overall mortality, perhaps related to sociodemographic factors. In the subset of 23 cities for which we had partial data on the timing of interventions, an even stronger correlation was found between excess mortality and how early in the epidemic interventions were introduced. We then fitted an epidemic model to weekly mortality in 16 cities with nearly complete intervention-timing data and estimated the impact of interventions. The model reproduced the observed epidemic patterns well. In line with theoretical arguments, we found the time-limited interventions used reduced total mortality only moderately (perhaps 10 – 30 %), and that the impact was often very limited because of interventions being introduced too late and lifted too early. San Francisco, St. Louis, Milwaukee, and Kansas City had the most <b>effective</b> <b>interventions,</b> reducing transmission <b>rates</b> by up to 30 – 50 %.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization {{reported}} in 2011 that irrational use of medicines {{was a serious}} global problem that is wasteful and harmful. The worst is use of ineffective or harmful interventions which {{should not be used}} at all. However, {{little is known about the}} changes that 20 years of evidence-based medicine has made particularly in reducing use of ineffective interventions. We surveyed clinicians in China to show how often ineffective interventions were still used in practice. METHODS: 3, 246 clinicians from 24 tertiary hospitals were surveyed in person and another 3, 063 through an online survey between 2006 - 2007. The main outcomes are prescription by a clinician, and use in a patient of, an ineffective intervention and of a matched <b>effective</b> <b>intervention</b> in patients with the same disease. 129 ineffective interventions for 68 diseases were identified from the BMJ Clinical Evidence and included in the survey. One <b>effective</b> <b>intervention</b> was identified for each disease and a total of 68 <b>effective</b> <b>interventions</b> were thus also included. The frequency of use of <b>effective</b> <b>interventions</b> was used as a reference for that of ineffective intervention. RESULTS: The mean prescription rate by clinicians is 59. 0 % (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) : 58. 6 % to 59. 4 %) and 81. 0 % (95 % CI: 80. 6 % to 81. 4 %) respectively for ineffective and <b>effective</b> <b>interventions.</b> The mean frequency of use in patients is 31. 2 % (95 % CI: 30. 8 % to 31. 6 %) and 56. 4 % (95 % CI: 56. 0 % to 56. 8 %) for ineffective and <b>effective</b> <b>interventions</b> respectively. The relative reduction in use of ineffective interventions as compared with that of matched <b>effective</b> <b>interventions</b> is 27. 2 % (95 % CI: 27. 0 % to 27. 4 %) and 44. 7 % (95 % CI: 44. 3 % to 45. 1 %) for clinician's prescription and use in patients respectively. 8. 6 % ineffective interventions were still routinely used in practice.
