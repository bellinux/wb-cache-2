50|$|During the Middle Ages, some Jews practiced usury {{against the}} non-Jews, while condemning {{it within the}} Jewish community. Most medieval rabbis {{approved}} of such practice, which helped the Jews to survive in antisemitic states, where they were excluded from most professions. However, a number of prominent rabbis explain that usury is unethical in nature, and is not allowed against people, who treat Jews well. Emphasis on cooperative productive word and criticism of wage labor and of profit <b>from</b> <b>financial</b> <b>operations</b> is found in some Judaic ethical treatises, including Sefer HaBrit by Rabbi Pinchas Eliyahu of Vilna, Tiferet Israel by Israel Lipschitz, and Memoirs of Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn, the sixth Lubavicher Rebbe.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the biggest}} risks arising <b>from</b> <b>financial</b> <b>operations</b> is the risk of {{counterparty}} default, commonly known as a “credit risk”. Leaving unmanaged, the credit risk would, with a high probability, result in a crash of a bank. In our paper, we {{will focus on the}} credit risk quantification methodology. We will demonstrate that the current regulatory standards for credit risk management are at least not perfect, {{despite the fact that the}} regulatory framework for credit risk measurement is more developed than systems for measuring other risks, e. g. market risks or operational risk. Generalizing the well known KMV model, standing behind Basel II, we build a model of a loan portfolio involving a dynamics of the common factor, influencing the borrowers’ assets, which we allow to be non-normal. We show how the parameters of our model may be estimated by means of past mortgage deliquency rates. We give a statistical evidence that the non-normal model is much more suitable than the one assuming the normal distribution of the risk factors. We point out how the assumption that risk factors follow a normal distribution can be dangerous. Especially during volatile periods comparable to the current crisis, the normal distribution based methodology can underestimate the impact of change in tail losses caused by underlying risk factors.

The objective of this study was to analyze the economic and financial performance of the 25 largest Brazilian credit cooperatives. We used descriptive, document and quantitative method. The review period was the years 2008 to 2012. We used the Topsis method and logistic regression using the SPSS software. Using the method was generated Topsis the ranking of economic and financial performance of cooperatives under study, the indicators of asset quality and rates of return and PEARLS model costs. After generating the ranking of cooperatives, we used logistic regression technique to verify the variables of financial economic indicators of the study groups of the PEARLS model, which had greater significance for the formation of ranking. The results showed that the indicators relationship between costs of borrowings and transfers with borrowings and average transfers (R 4), ratio of operating expenses to average total assets (R 6) and the relationship between income <b>from</b> <b>financial</b> <b>operations</b> by operating revenue (R 9); the rate and costs of returns group, were the main indicators impacting the ranking formed. Thus, the financial economic performance of the analyzed cooperatives was related to management efficiency in terms of control of operating costs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: To date, {{typical process}} {{modelling}} approaches put {{a strong emphasis}} on behavioural aspects of business op-erations. However, they often neglect value-related information. Yet, such information is of key importance to strategic decision-making, for instance in the context of process re-engineering. In this paper we propose a value-oriented approach to business process modelling that facilitates managerial decision-making in the context of process re-design based on concepts and metrics <b>from</b> <b>financial</b> and <b>operations</b> management. ...|$|R

40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis {{has affected the}} Croatian local public sector. In such circumstances, local government units’ debts and borrowing should be approached with caution. The highly interwoven <b>financial</b> <b>operations</b> of local government units and their utilities indicate the need for analysis of consolidated financial statements of local governments and utility companies {{in order to gain}} an insight into the real financial “health” of local units. Accordingly, the main aim {{of this paper is to}} analyze the size and the structure of the consolidated (local government and utility companies) local public debt in Croatia. Accordingly, the paper presents the financial position of local government units supplemented with information on the <b>financial</b> <b>operations</b> of utility companies, with particular emphasis on the size and structure of their liabilities and gross and net debt. Although the current Budget Law does not require formal preparation of consolidated financial statements by local governments and their utility firms, consolidation is stipulated by International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). The application of IPSAS regulations would be helpful in determining overall direct and indirect exposure of local government units arising <b>from</b> the <b>financial</b> <b>operations</b> of their utilities. local government units’ debts, utility companies’ debts, the consolidation of financial statements of local units and utility companies, Croatia...|$|R
