2500|$|The SD70ACu is a {{diesel-electric}} locomotive first built by EMD and later rebuilt by Norfolk Southern. It is originally an SD90MAC (or well-known as SD9043MAC) {{that has been}} rebuilt to renew its electrical components and replace the cab with the new EMD Phase-II cab {{to comply with the}} most recent safety requirements. These locomotives are similar to the SD70ACe model, but have a different prime mover, which is EMD's 4,300hp (3,210kW) 16-cylinder 710G engine, the same engine used on the SD70MAC. The SD70ACu has three radiator fans, retaining the original configuration of that of SD9043MAC instead of two radiator fans as SD70ACe has. The shape of the rear end of SD70ACu looks like a [...] "Big T", which was the rear end shape of the SD9043MAC, while the rear end shape of SD70ACe is like an [...] "arrow head" [...] (from above). They also <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> EMD cab that meets current FRA crashworthiness standards. These locomotives also have the Ultra Cab II, locomotive speed limiter (LSL), and cab signals. 100 of the 110 units Norfolk Southern purchased were originally SD9043MACs previously operated by the Union Pacific Railroad. The other 10 units were acquired by a trade with Cit Group for MP15DC's. All NS-owned SD9043MACs are slowly being rebuilt by NS at its shops in Altoona, Pennsylvania. As of September 20, 2017, 84 SD70ACU units have been completed and released to active service.|$|E

6000|$|But {{it is most}} {{satisfactory}} of all to {{know that}} the best of the British abolitionists are now acting, promptly and efficiently, in accordance with those views, and are determined to develop the resources of the British empire for the production of cotton by free labor. The thing is practicable, and not of very difficult accomplishment. It is furthermore absolutely essential {{to the success of the}} antislavery cause; for now the great practical leading argument for slavery is, Without slavery you can have no cotton, and cotton you must and will <b>have.</b> <b>The</b> <b>latest</b> work that I have read in defence of slavery (Uncle Tom in Paris, Baltimore, 1854) says, (pp. 56-7,) [...] "Of the cotton which supplies the wants of the civilized world, the south produces 86 per cent.; and without slave labor experience has shown that the cotton plant cannot be cultivated." ...|$|E
6000|$|In France, the flirting is {{all done}} after marriage, {{and the young}} girl looks forward to it as her {{introduction}} to a career of conquest.

A knowledge of French is beginning to be considered as the pearl of great price, to gain which, all else must be sold. The girls {{must go to the}} French theatre, and be stared at by French débauchées, who laugh at them while they pretend they understand what, thank Heaven, they cannot. Then we are to have series of French novels, carefully translated, and puffed and praised even by the religious press, written by the corps of French female reformers, which will show them exactly how the naughty French women manage their cards; so that, by and by, we shall <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> phase of eclecticism,--the union of American and French manners.

6000|$|... “The {{outlook is}} not {{encouraging}} for us smaller businesses,” said Mr. Scarrick {{to the artist}} and his sister, who had taken rooms over his suburban grocery store. “These big concerns are offering all sorts of attractions to the shopping public which we couldn’t afford to imitate, even on a small scale—reading-rooms and play-rooms and gramophones and Heaven knows what. People don’t care to buy half a pound of sugar nowadays unless they can listen to Harry Lauder and <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> Australian cricket scores ticked off before their eyes. With the big Christmas stock we’ve got in we ought to keep half a dozen assistants hard at work, but as it is my nephew Jimmy and myself can pretty well attend to it ourselves. It’s a nice stock of goods, too, if I could only run it off {{in a few weeks}} time, but there’s no chance of that—not unless the London line was to get snowed up for a fortnight before Christmas. I did have a sort of idea of engaging Miss Luffcombe to give recitations during afternoons; she made a great hit at the Post Office entertainment with her rendering of ‘Little Beatrice’s Resolve’.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My other novel," [...] Hewet continued, [...] "is about a {{young man}} who is obsessed by an idea--the idea of being a gentleman. He manages to exist at Cambridge on a hundred pounds a year. He has a coat; it was once a very good coat. But the trousers--they're not so good. Well, he goes up to London, gets into good society, owing to an early-morning {{adventure}} {{on the banks of the}} Serpentine. He is led into telling lies--my idea, you see, is to show the gradual corruption of the soul--calls himself the son of some great landed proprietor in Devonshire. Meanwhile the coat becomes older and older, and he hardly dares to wear the trousers. Can't you imagine the wretched man, after some splendid evening of debauchery, contemplating these garments--hanging them over the end of the bed, arranging them now in full light, now in shade, and wondering whether they will survive him, or he will survive them? Thoughts of suicide cross his mind. He has a friend, too, a man who somehow subsists upon selling small birds, for which he sets traps in the fields near Uxbridge. They're scholars, both of them. I know one or two wretched starving creatures like that who quote Aristotle at you over a fried herring and a pint of porter. Fashionable life, too, I have to represent at some length, in order to show my hero under all circumstances. Lady Theo Bingham Bingley, whose bay mare he had the good fortune to stop, is the daughter of a very fine old Tory peer. I'm going to describe the kind of parties I once went to--the fashionable intellectuals, you know, who like to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> book on their tables. They give parties, river parties, parties where you play games. There's no difficulty in conceiving incidents; the difficulty is to put them into shape--not to get run away with, as Lady Theo was. It ended disastrously for her, poor woman, for the book, as I planned it, was going to end in profound and sordid respectability. Disowned by her father, she marries my hero, and they live in a snug little villa outside Croydon, in which town he is set up as a house agent. He never succeeds in becoming a real gentleman after all. That's the interesting part of it. Does it seem to you the kind of book you'd like to read?" [...] he enquired; [...] "or perhaps you'd like my Stuart tragedy better," [...] he continued, without waiting for her to answer him. [...] "My idea is that there's a certain quality of beauty in the past, which the ordinary historical novelist completely ruins by his absurd conventions. The moon becomes the Regent of the Skies. People clap spurs to their horses, and so on. I'm going to treat people as though they were exactly the same as we are. The advantage is that, detached from modern conditions, one can make them more intense and more abstract then people who live as we do." ...|$|E
