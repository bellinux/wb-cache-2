50|$|Potassium tartrate, <b>di{{potassium}}</b> <b>tartrate</b> or argol has formula K2C4H4O6. It is the {{potassium salt}} of tartaric acid. It is often confused with potassium bitartrate, {{also known as}} cream of tartar. As a food additive, it shares the E number E336 with potassium bitartrate.|$|E
50|$|Some other {{piezoelectric}} materials than quartz can be employed. These include single crystals of lithium tantalate, lithium niobate, lithium borate, berlinite, gallium arsenide, lithium tetraborate, aluminium phosphate, bismuth germanium oxide, polycrystalline zirconium titanate ceramics, high-alumina ceramics, silicon-zinc oxide composite, or <b>dipotassium</b> <b>tartrate.</b> Some materials may be {{more suitable}} for specific applications. An oscillator crystal can be also manufactured by depositing the resonator material on the silicon chip surface. Crystals of gallium phosphate, langasite, langanite and langanate are about 10 times more pullable than the corresponding quartz crystals, and are used in some VCXO oscillators.|$|E
40|$|A brief {{introduction}} will {{be given}} to the discovery of piezoelectricity and the significant application made by Paul Langevin. Then follows an account of the search for and development of new materials, natural and synthetic, with particular relevance to piezoelectric and mechanical properties. The advent of new techniques such as vapour-deposited transducers will be mentioned and how piezoelectric semi-conductors may be «tailored» to achieve desired qualities leading to depletion-layer and diffusion-layer transducers. Reference is made to polorized ceramics and their properties and those of new piezoelectric materials such as diamine tartrate, <b>dipotassium</b> <b>tartrate</b> and lithium iodate. Qualitative statements {{have been made in the}} past regarding the existence of piezoelectricity in various non-crystalline materials, but it was not until the mid- 1950 's that quantitative confirmation was forthcoming in wood specimens. The Japanese workers concerned also showed the existence of piezoelectricity in various kinds of biological tissues such as bone, tendon, muscle, etc., and in oriented polymers. The growing impact of ultrasonics on many aspects of everyday activities will be emphasised, from its use in the laboratory for probing various states of matter to industrial processes of metal forming, welding, etc., and its widespread use in non-destructive testing. In many medical applications it has become an essential diagnostic and surgical tool and the use of new piezoelectric devices for mechanical surface wave generation is leading to advances in filter and delayline design for communication purposes...|$|E
40|$|Undoubtedly {{the most}} {{important}} of the bismuth anti-luetics, from a clinical standpoint today, are the insoluble tartrates. Sauton and Robert (1) first demonstrated the effectiveness of these drugs in fowl spirillosis. Sazerac and Levaditi (2) then studied their action in syphilis, both human and experimental. Raiziss and Brown (3) have studied the kidney damage through studies of the non-protein nitrogen of the blood and the effects of these drugs in noimal animals. Myer and Corbitt (4) have investigated the toxicity of such tartrobismuthates to the rat. Kolle (5) has studied the toxic and tolerated doses. Lucke and Klauder (6) have investigated in particular the nephropathic effects. Hopkins (7) has studied the insoluble sodium potas-sium tartrobismuthate, with greatest detail as to toxicity and curative effects. Few of these studies have taken into account the exact bis-muth content of the drug given, nor the concentration nor rate of excretion of the drug by the kidney in relation to the kidney damage. We therefore undertook to study these quantitative factors for <b>dipotassium</b> bismuth <b>tartrate</b> {{in a manner similar to}} the study of the soluble salts in the previous paper (8), togethe...|$|R
