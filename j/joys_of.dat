5|$|A Literary Polish {{language}} breakthrough {{came under}} the influence of the Reformation with the writings of Mikołaj Rej. In his Brief Discourse, a satire published in 1543, he defends a serf from a priest and a noble, but in his later works he often celebrates the <b>joys</b> <b>of</b> the peaceful but privileged life of a country gentleman. Rej, whose legacy is his unbashful promotion of the Polish language, left a great variety of literary pieces. Łukasz Górnicki, an author and translator, perfected the Polish prose of the period. His contemporary and friend Jan Kochanowski became one of the greatest Polish poets of all time.|$|E
5|$|As {{the elder}} sibling, Durga cares for Apu with motherly affection, but spares no {{opportunity}} to tease him. Together, they share the simple <b>joys</b> <b>of</b> life: sitting quietly under a tree, viewing pictures in a travelling vendor's bioscope, running after the candy man who passes through the village, and watching a jatra (folk theatre) performed by a troupe of actors. Every evening they are delighted {{by the sound of}} a distant train's whistle. One day, they run away from home {{to catch a glimpse of}} the train, only to discover Indir lying dead on their return.|$|E

5|$|Alfie Karmal, {{the son of}} a Palestinian {{father and}} Greek mother, was ten years older than Mills when they met in 1986. Karmal bought her new clothes and Cartier jewellery, and paid for {{cosmetic}} surgery to her breasts. Karmal, who had moved into the computer industry, set up a model agency for her, ExSell Management, although it was not successful. In 1987, Mills went to live in Paris, telling Karmal that a cosmetics company had given her a modelling contract, but became the mistress of millionaire Lebanese businessman George Kazan for two years and took part in a photo session for a stills-only German sex education manual called Die Freuden der Liebe (The <b>Joys</b> <b>of</b> Love).|$|E
5|$|Likewise, Liszt's {{inclusion}} of a choral finale in his Dante Symphony changed both the structural and programmatic intent of the work. Liszt's intent was to follow {{the structure of the}} Divina Commedia and compose Dante in three movements—one each for the Inferno, Purgatorio and Paradiso. However, Liszt's son-in-law Richard Wagner persuaded him that no earthly composer could faithfully express the <b>joys</b> <b>of</b> Paradise. Liszt dropped the third movement but added a choral element, a Magnificat, {{at the end of the}} second. This action, Searle claims, effectively destroyed the work's formal balance and left the listener, like Dante, to gaze upward at the heights of Heaven and hear its music from afar. Shulstad suggests that the choral finale actually helps complete the work's programmatic trajectory from struggle to paradise.|$|E
5|$|A chorus greets {{the dawn}} as Ariadne, after a troubled night's sleep, {{returns to the}} shore with her companion, Dorilla, to find that Theseus has departed. Dorilla offers her comfort. In despair {{at the thought that}} Theseus will not return, Ariadne {{nevertheless}} decides to go to the landing area to wait for him. In a pastoral interlude a chorus sings of the <b>joys</b> <b>of</b> rural life, and expresses the hope that Theseus will not forget Ariadne. Primed by an envoy with the news that Ariadne is alone and sorrowing, the chorus again sings in sympathy with her. On the beach, Ariadne sings her lament for her lost love and prepares to kill herself. At this point fanfares are heard heralding an arrival, causing Ariadne to hope that it is Theseus returning. In another interlude the chorus empathises, but a second envoy announces that it is Bacchus who has arrived, having taken pity on Ariadne. A sung ballo celebrates the anticipated betrothal of Bacchus and Ariadne. In the final scene Cupid reappears, and Venus rises from the sea before Jupiter speaks his blessing from the heavens. The union is sealed as Bacchus promises Ariadne immortality in heaven, and a crown of stars.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine whether CEOs’ {{identification}} with the family firm contributes to their <b>joy</b> <b>of</b> work. Literature indicates that family business CEOs' {{identification with the}}ir firm can be both a burden and a joy. Building on psychological ownership literature, we argue that identification leads to <b>joy</b> <b>of</b> work under the condition of psychological ownership experienced by the CEO. In contrast to previous studies, we differentiate between individual-oriented and collective-oriented psychological ownership as two distinct dimensions of individual psychological ownership. We find that CEO’s organizational identification is an important determinant <b>of</b> <b>joy</b> <b>of</b> work but this relationship is only mediated by collective-oriented psychological ownership. Moreover, only collective-oriented psychological ownership is found to contribute to CEO’s <b>joy</b> <b>of</b> work. This {{is important to know}} because CEO’s who experience <b>joy</b> <b>of</b> work may be more willing ‘to be involved in processes of transgenerational succession and long-term survival’ of the family firm. status: publishe...|$|R
