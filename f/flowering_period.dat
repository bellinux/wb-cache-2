5|$|Plant {{species that}} are genetically {{compatible}} may not hybridize in nature for various reasons, including geographical isolation, differences in <b>flowering</b> <b>period,</b> or differences in pollinators. Species that are brought together by humans in gardens may hybridize naturally, or hybridization can be facilitated by human efforts, such as altered <b>flowering</b> <b>period</b> or artificial pollination. Hybrids are sometimes created by humans to produce improved plants that {{have some of the}} characteristics of each of the parent species. Much work is now being done with hybrids between crops and their wild relatives to improve disease-resistance or climate resilience for both agricultural and horticultural crops.|$|E
5|$|Pollinators {{have not}} been observed, and the <b>flowering</b> <b>period</b> is brief when {{compared}} with other banksias. However, the flowers appear when little else is in bloom, rendering it a valuable food source for animals.|$|E
5|$|A given flower is {{open only}} for a single day, opening before dawn and closing in the afternoon. Flowers are self-fecundating and protogynous (with female parts {{maturing}} first), and will self-pollinate if {{they have not been}} pollinated by insects during the day. While many insects visit the flowers, only some bees actually accomplish pollination. V.thapsus <b>flowering</b> <b>period</b> lasts from June to August in most of its range, extending to September or October in warmer climates. Visitors include halictid bees and hoverflies. The hair on lower stamens may serve to provide footholds for visitors.|$|E

5000|$|Abiu {{may have}} several <b>flowering</b> <b>periods</b> a year, with {{potential}} for both flowers and fruit {{on the tree}} at one time. The development time from flower to ripe fruit is approximately three months. [...] The main crop season varies by climate.|$|R
5|$|Rarely cultivated, Banksia ilicifolia {{requires}} a sunny position and sandy well-drained soil to do well. A slow-growing plant, it takes {{up to ten}} years to flower from seed. The glossy green foliage and long <b>flowering</b> <b>period,</b> combined with prominently displayed flowers give it horticultural potential, although its prickly foliage makes fallen leaves a problem if planted near lawns or walkways. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 22 to 41 days to germinate. Difficulties in collection and low seed set make seed relatively expensive. Seeds are often eaten by insects {{before they can be}} collected.|$|E
5|$|The shrub {{grows on}} sandy soils in {{seasonally}} wet lowland {{areas as well}} as hills and dunes. It regenerates after bushfire by resprouting from its underground lignotuber. Pollinators include honeyeaters, particularly the western spinebill, which can access the nectar with its long curved bill, and the silvereye, which punctures the flower tube. The most commonly cultivated Adenanthos species in Australia, it has a long <b>flowering</b> <b>period</b> and attracts honeyeaters to the garden. It is harvested for the cut flower industry.|$|E
5|$|Vanilla {{is grown}} on small patches of land {{both as a}} single crop {{as well as an}} inter crop. As it needs lot of water for growth, it is largely grown on the rainier {{windward}} side of the island. Initially, vanilla is planted next to small trees until its vines grow to some height, at which point it is cut down closer to the soil so that it spreads across the ground. It starts to flower when about three years old; the <b>flowering</b> <b>period</b> is from July to August.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the most suitable first time of irrigation depending on different <b>flowering</b> <b>periods</b> two standard cotton varieties (Nazilli 84 and Nazilli M- 503). Field trials were conducted at Nazilli Cotton Research Institute in Meander Valley of Aegean Region in 1999 - 2001. The first irrigation time were applied in four different <b>flowering</b> <b>periods</b> (after 10 days from squaring; beginning of flowering; 50 % flowering; peak flowering). Seed cotton yield, fiber length, fiber strength and fiber fineness were measured. The differences among years were significant for all characteristics except fiber length. Seed cotton yield and fiber length had affected from first irrigation time. Genotypic differences {{were found to be}} significant for the investigated characteristics. Finally, early first irrigation time was recommended depending on sudden July temperatures...|$|R
30|$|The {{evolution}} of sister species {{is not always}} combined with parallel evolutionary shifts in pollination syndromes (Cozzolino and Widmer 2005). As a consequence, these closely related species, usually growing in sympatry and having overlapping <b>flowering</b> <b>periods</b> and non-specific pollination are exposed to ample opportunities for inter-specific hybridization (van der Cingel 2001; Jersáková et al. 2006).|$|R
50|$|Various {{forms of}} Grevillea banksii {{have been in}} {{cultivation}} for many decades, however it is less seen now than previously {{as it has been}} replaced by smaller, more compact, hybrids such as G. 'Robyn Gordon' and G.' Superb'. These newer plants are more compact and have longer <b>flowering</b> <b>periods</b> and are more in demand in the era of the shrinking garden.|$|R
5|$|Blackcurrants {{can grow}} well on sandy or heavy loams, or forest soils, {{as long as}} their {{nutrient}} requirements are met. They prefer damp, fertile but not waterlogged ground and are intolerant of drought. Although the bushes are winter hardy, frosts during the <b>flowering</b> <b>period</b> may adversely affect the yield and cold winds may restrict the number of flying insects visiting and pollinating the flowers. A pH of about 6 is ideal for blackcurrants and the ground can be limed if the soil is too acidic. Planting is usually done in the autumn or winter to allow the plants to become established before growth starts in the spring, but container-grown stock can be planted at any time of year.|$|E
5|$|Flowers change sex {{in their}} development, so the stamens release their pollen before {{the stigma of}} the same flower is receptive. The {{arrangement}} is centripetal, meaning the oldest flowers are near the edge and the youngest flowers are in the center. Flowers usually first open at {{the outer edge of}} the primary umbel, followed about a week later on the secondary umbels, and then in subsequent weeks in higher-order umbels. The usual <b>flowering</b> <b>period</b> of individual umbels is 7 to 10 days, so a plant can be in the process of flowering for 30–50 days. The distinctive umbels and floral nectaries attract pollinating insects. After fertilization and as seeds develop, the outer umbellets of an umbel bend inward causing the umbel shape to change from slightly convex or fairly flat to concave, and when cupped it resembles a bird's nest.|$|E
25|$|Healthy plants produce 3mm (⅛in) bulblets at {{the leaf}} axils {{following}} the <b>flowering</b> <b>period.</b> These form new plants the following year, {{serving as a}} means of vegetative reproduction. Plants in arctic habitats do not form these bulblets.|$|E
40|$|Interactions {{of garden}} botanical {{composition}} with human senses generate sensations and emotions that may give pleasure and welfare to observers. Among the garden plants, roses {{are the most}} important for the wide range of varieties and flower colours. This review is focused on physiological factors that regulate flower longevity and colour persistence in roses that are generally used for garden decorations. Genes that encode for pigments biosynthesis can be used for improving flower colours. The colour persistence of flowers is tightly related to senescence. In fact, senescence associated genes have been discovered and the study of their function may be useful for genetic improvement for extending the <b>flowering</b> <b>periods.</b> The <b>flower</b> colour and the length of the <b>flowering</b> <b>periods</b> are very important factors that contribute to the garden beauty. Colours cannot be objectively appreciated because they can be differently appreciated by the observers. Therefore, sensations and emotions that rose alone or in combinations with other shrubs and perennials in a garden cannot be predictable...|$|R
50|$|Much hybridising {{work has}} been done to produce modern hybrids with an {{increased}} range of flower colours and forms, leaf variations, increased <b>flowering</b> <b>periods,</b> and more recently to introduce scent. Thanks to the work of hybridisers, streptocarpus now come in a range of colours. These include reds, pinks, purples, blues, yellows, whites, and near-blacks. The only colour that is so-far not available is a true orange.|$|R
50|$|In early 1956, Wenhui Bao {{was forced}} to {{relocate}} to Beijing and was renamed Jiaoshibao (Teacher's News).

25|$|Even if {{climate and}} {{vineyard}} management has been ideal, other factors may prevent full and even ripeness. Among the clusters of a grapevine, individual berries may not all ripen {{at the same}} pace. This problem, commonly known as millerandage, could occur because of poor weather during the <b>flowering</b> <b>period</b> of the grape but can also be caused by soil deficient in various nutrients such as boron, an attack of various grapevine ailments such as the grapevine fanleaf virus or {{a number of other}} factors that may contribute to incomplete plant fertilization.|$|E
25|$|The northwestern wine {{regions are}} {{particularly}} prone {{to the effects}} of the hurricane force winds known as the Zonda which blows from the Andes during the <b>flowering</b> <b>period</b> of early summer. This fierce wind of hot, dry air can disrupt the flowering process and severely reduce potential yields. Most of the growing season is dry with the lack of humidity limiting the risk and hazard from various grape diseases and fungal rot. Many vineyards operate without the need for any chemical spraying, a condition conducive to organic viticulture. The periodic occurrence of the El Niño phenomenon can have a sharp influence on climate condition during a growing season-such as the case during the 1998 vintage when prolong heavy rains brought by El Niño led to widespread rot and fungal disease.|$|E
25|$|S. graminifolium {{is one of}} the few Stylidium species commercially {{available}} for sale as seed. This species, along with six other triggerplants, was tested for horticultural value and cold hardiness by Douglas Darnowski in the United States from 2000 to 2002. Dr. Darnowski's study concluded that S. graminifolium was able to survive cold temperatures down to -10°C, making it suitable for growing outside in as low as USDA hardiness zone 8. Darnowski also postulated that S. graminifoliums attractive floral spikes could be of use in floriculture and could be used to replace purple loosestrife in winter and spring arrangements. It has a relatively long <b>flowering</b> <b>period</b> and has somewhat specific conditions for germination, including smoke treatments and higher temperatures to simulate a bushfire, though germination can occur without these conditions. These germination requirements reduce the risk that it will become an invasive species. It is also able to grow on nutrient-poor soils and withstand significant drought. These attributes increase its potential for floricultural use.|$|E

The basic morphological features of Ch. sinensis Lindl. and Ch. tamiana B. L. Burt are represented. The adaptation level to the conservatory soil is estimated. The terms of <b>flowering</b> <b>periods</b> were established. Data on morphological features of two Chirita species are important for the best understanding of their cultivation. It {{can be used in}} a selection, growing and reproduction of Chirita...|$|R
50|$|Most {{species are}} insect-pollinated. Native bees and jewel beetles are {{commonly}} observed on the flowers. Astartea flower in summer, when many other plants have finished their <b>flowering</b> <b>periods,</b> so the genus may provide {{an important source}} of summer food for nectar-feeding insects. Many sap-feeding insects {{can be found on the}} plants, including mirid bugs and larval felt scales. Astartea often have galls, which are probably formed by wasp taxa. Some species have seeds that may be adapted to dispersal by ants.|$|R
50|$|Senecio radicans {{produces}} small, cinnamon-scented, {{white or}} off-white flowers, {{usually in the}} late winter or early spring seasons, although some growers are able to encourage multiple <b>flowering</b> <b>periods</b> throughout the year. Like other species in the Senecio genus, The inflorescences consist of clusters of many small flowers on a common receptacle. This species, {{like most of the}} Senecios, are grown more for the color, shape, or texture of their foliage than for their blooms, which are small, white, and not very showy.|$|R
25|$|In {{very dry}} climates that receive little rainfall, {{irrigation}} is considered essential to any viticultural prospects. Many New World wine regions such as Australia and California regularly practice irrigation {{in areas that}} couldn't otherwise support viticulture. Advances and research in these wine regions (as well as some Old World wine regions such as Israel), have shown that potential wine quality could increase in areas where irrigation is {{kept to a minimum}} and managed. The main principle behind this is controlled water stress, where the vine receives sufficient water during the budding and <b>flowering</b> <b>period,</b> but irrigation is then scaled back during the ripening period so that the vine then responds by funneling more of its limited resources into developing the grape clusters instead of excess foliage. If the vine receives too much water stress, then photosynthesis and other important processes such as nutrient storage could be impacted with the vine essentially shutting down. The availability of irrigation means that if drought conditions emerge, sufficient water can be provided for the plant so that the balance between water stress and development is kept to optimal levels.|$|E
500|$|P. moranensis {{produces}} one {{to seven}} flowers during each <b>flowering</b> <b>period.</b> [...] These are borne singly on upright flower stalks which are green to brown-green {{in color and}} usually, like the upper surface of the carnivorous leaves, are densely covered in glandular hairs; the peduncles do, in fact, trap insect prey. The peduncles are 10 to 25centimeters (4–10in.) long and taper from two to three millimeters (⅛in.) at the base to one millimeter (in.) at the top.|$|E
500|$|For horticultural purposes, all Narcissus cultivars {{are split}} into 13 {{divisions}} as first described by Kington (1998), for the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), based partly upon flower form (shape {{and length of}} corona), number of flowers per stem, <b>flowering</b> <b>period</b> and partly upon genetic background. Division 13, which includes wild daffodils, is the exception to this scheme. The classification is {{a useful tool for}} planning planting. Most commercially available narcissi come from Divisions 1 (Trumpet), 2 (Large cupped) and 8 (Tazetta).|$|E
40|$|Juncus effusus and J. conglomeratus {{appear to}} be {{specifically}} distinct in the British Isles; J. conglomeratus is the rarer species. Their principal diagnostic features are given. Evidence is presented {{to show that the}} two species hybridize at higher altitudes in Britain, probably because the overlap of their <b>flowering</b> <b>periods</b> is longer in these regions than at low altitudes. Evidence is also found for gene flow within J. effusus populations from J. conglomeratus and the reasons for the continuing specific distinctness of these two species is discussed...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of Hamamelis vernalis Sarg. and H. Virginiana L. was begun in southwestern Arkansas {{in the tall}} of 1976. An overlap of <b>flowering</b> <b>periods</b> occurred from late November through December, affording the possibility of hybridization. At one site the two taxa flowered simultaneously only 30 yards apart. Variation occurs in both taxa {{and there is a}} degree of overlap in most characters, but the composite of diagnostic features distinguishes the two species. The hybrid origin of H. vernalis suggested by Jenne (1966) does not seem likely...|$|R
40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{biology and}} ecology of five non-hybridizing, sympatric species of Aneilema in Kenya is investigated.

Differences in ecology and seasonal <b>flowering</b> <b>periods</b> appear to be inadequate to reproductively isolate these species. However, differences in daily flowering times, pollinators, floral morphology and opening behaviour, and in chromosome number, alone or in combination (perhaps also coacting with other factors not fully evaluated), are effective isolating mechanisms. </p...|$|R
500|$|The list of Narcissus horticultural {{divisions}} {{provided by}} the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) is the standard method used to classify and describe cultivated varieties (cultivars) of Narcissus. It is widely used since the RHS is the international authority for the registration of such cultivars.

Division 13, which includes all the wild rather than cultivated daffodils, is the exception to this scheme.|$|E
500|$|The {{leaves of}} this species are bright green, oval in shape, up to [...] long and [...] wide, sessile, and {{arranged}} in a spiral pattern on the branches. The flowers appear steadily between April and December, and are most frequent between August and October. [...] They are red or orange, and emerge from the leaf axils. They are usually solitary, but occasionally an axil will carry two flowers. As with other Proteaceae species, each flower consists of a perianth of four united tepals, and a single style. In A.obovatus, the perianth is around [...] long, and the style around [...] Although the <b>flowering</b> <b>period</b> is lengthy (six months), there are generally only a few flowers at any one time, and a seven-year study at Harry Waring Marsupial Reserve south of Perth revealed fairly constant flowering from year to year, even when shrubs were cut back to ground level to simulate a bushfire.|$|E
