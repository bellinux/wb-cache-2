40|$|Like large {{hydropower}} {{counterparts in}} the Columbia River, low-elevation dams and irrigation diversions may impede adult salmonid migrations as fish approach spawning areas in smaller tributaries. The Umatilla River has seven low elevation dams that may obstruct Chinook salmon and steelhead access to historic spawning areas. We used radio telemetry to examine <b>fallback</b> <b>rates,</b> passage routes, rates, and delays, holding and spawning locations, and maximum upstream distribution of Chinook salmon and steelhead in the Umatilla River basin (Oregon). Analyses focused {{on the effects of}} project modifications on salmonid passage and overall system use by fish. Detections at fixed receivers and mobile tracking of 476 tagged steelhead, 130 spring Chinook salmon, and 206 fall Chinook salmon from 2009 - 2012 provided data for these analyses. Recent project modifications at individual diversion structures have resulted in marked improvements in fish passages times. Species show preference for different aspects of the modifications; for example, jump pools are used by spring Chinook more than steelhead. System passage times have also been markedly reduced. Locating key holding and spawning areas will provide information for additional habitat and restoration needs. The determination of upstream distribution and spawning of hatchery fish will allow managers to better assess the use of hatchery releases to supplement historical spawning areas...|$|R
40|$|We propose an {{approximate}} approach {{for studying the}} relativistic regime of stellar tidal disruptions by rotating massive black holes. It combines an exact relativistic description of the hydrodynamical evolution of a test fluid in a fixed curved spacetime with a Newtonian treatment of the fluid's self-gravity. Explicit expressions for the equations of motion are derived for Kerr spacetime using two different coordinate systems. We implement the new methodology within an existing Newtonian Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics code and show that including the additional physics involves very little extra computational cost. We carefully explore {{the validity of the}} novel approach by first testing its ability to recover geodesic motion, and then by comparing the outcome of tidal disruption simulations against previous relativistic studies. We further compare simulations in Boyer [...] Lindquist and Kerr [...] Schild coordinates and conclude that our approach allows accurate simulation even of tidal disruption events where the star penetrates deeply inside the tidal radius of a rotating black hole. Finally, we use the new method to study the effect of the black hole spin on the morphology and <b>fallback</b> <b>rate</b> of the debris streams resulting from tidal disruptions, finding that while the spin has little effect on the <b>fallback</b> <b>rate,</b> it does imprint heavily on the stream morphology, and can even be a determining factor in the survival or disruption of the star itself.

40|$|During {{a stellar}} tidal {{disruption}} event (TDE), an accretion disk forms as stellar debris {{returns to the}} disruption site and circularizes. Rather than being confined within the circularizing radius, the disk can spread to larger radii to conserve angular momentum. A spreading disk {{is a source of}} matter for re-accretion at rates which can exceed the later stellar <b>fallback</b> <b>rate,</b> although a disk wind can suppress its contribution to the central black hole accretion rate. A spreading disk is detectible through a break in the central accretion rate history, or, at longer wavelengths, by its own emission. We model the evolution of TDE disk size and accretion rate, by accounting for the time-dependent <b>fallback</b> <b>rate,</b> for the influence of wind losses in the early, advective stage, and for the possibility of thermal instability for accretion rates intermediate between the advection-dominated and gas-pressure dominated states. The model provides a dynamic basis for modeling TDE light curves. All or part of a young TDE disk will precess as a solid body due to Lense-Thirring effect, and precession may manifest itself as quasi-periodic modulation of light curve. The precession period increases with time. Applying our results to the jetted TDE candidate Swift J 1644 + 57, whose X-ray light curve shows numerous quasi-periodic dips, we argue that the data best fit a scenario in which a main-sequence star was fully disrupted by an intermediate mass black hole on an orbit significantly inclined from the black hole equator, with the apparent jet shutoff at t= 500 d corresponding to a disk transition from the advective state to the gas-pressure dominated state.

40|$|Unambiguous {{detection}} of the tidal disruption {{of a star}} would allow {{an assessment of the}} presence and masses of supermassive black holes in quiescent galaxies. It would also provide invaluable information on bulge scale stellar processes (such as two-body relaxation) via the rate at which stars are injected into the tidal sphere of influence of the black holes. This rate, in turn, is essential to predict gravitational radiation emission by compact object inspirals. The signature of a tidal disruption event is thought to be a <b>fallback</b> <b>rate</b> for the stellar debris onto the black hole that decreases as t^- 5 / 3. This mass flux is often assumed to yield a luminous signal that decreases in time at the same rate. In this paper, we calculate the monochromatic lightcurves arising from such an accretion event. Differently from previous studies, we adopt a more realistic description of the <b>fallback</b> <b>rate</b> and of the super-Eddigton accretion physics. We also provide simultaneous lightcurves in optical, UV and X-rays. We show that, after a few months, optical and UV lightcurves scale as t^- 5 / 12, and are thus substantially flatter than the t^- 5 / 3 behaviour, which is a prerogative of the bolometric lightcurve, only. At earlier times and for black hole masses < 10 ^ 7 M_, the wind emission dominates: after reaching a peak of 10 ^ 41 - 10 ^ 43 erg/s at roughly a month, the lightcurve decreases steeply as ∼ t^- 2. 6, until the disc contribution takes over. The X-ray band, instead, is the best place to detect the t^- 5 / 3 "smoking gun" behaviour, although it is displayed only for roughly a year, before the emission steepens exponentially.

40|$|During their {{upstream}} {{spawning migration}} in the Columbia River basin, some adult salmonids (Oncorhynchus spp.) ascend and then fall back over main-stem hydroelectric dams. Fallback {{can result in}} fish injury or death, migration delays, and biases in fishway counts, the primary index for escapement and the basis for production estimates and harvest quotas. We used radiotelemetry to calculate <b>fallback</b> percentages and <b>rates,</b> reascension percentages, biases in fishway escapement estimates due to fallback, and occurrence of behaviourally motivated fallback (correcting overshoot of natal sites) by spring–summer and fall Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) and steelhead (O. mykiss). The study area included eight Columbia River and Snake River dams evaluated from 1996 to 2001. For all years combined, about 22 % of spring-summer Chinook salmon, 15 % of fall Chinook salmon, and 21 % of steelhead fell back at least once at a dam. Fallback percentages for spring–summer Chinook salmon were generally highest at Bonneville and the Dalles dams and decreased at progressively upstream dams. <b>Fallback</b> <b>rates</b> for spring–summer Chinook salmon were positively correlated with river discharge. Fallback percentages for steelhead and fall Chinook salmon were less variable between years but were more variable between dams than those of spring–summer Chinook salmon. Reascension percentages at dams ranged widely between runs and sites and were negatively related {{to the number of}} fish that entered tributaries downstream from the fallback location. Fall Chinook salmon were the most likely to enter a downstream tributary after falling back, though this behaviour was also observed in spring–summer Chinook salmon and steelhead.

40|$|A {{star that}} wanders {{too close to}} a massive black hole (BH) is {{shredded}} by the BH’s tidal gravity. Stellar gas falls back to the BH at a rate initially exceeding the Eddington rate, releasing a flare of energy. In anticipation of upcoming transient surveys, we predict the light curves and spectra of tidal flares as a function of time, highlighting the unique signatures of tidal flares at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. A reasonable fraction of the gas initially bound to the BH is likely blown away when the <b>fallback</b> <b>rate</b> is super-Eddington at early times. This outflow produces an optical luminosity comparable to that of a supernova; such events have durations of ∼ 10 days and may have been missed in supernova searches that exclude the nuclear regions of galaxies. When the <b>fallback</b> <b>rate</b> subsides below Eddington, the gas accretes onto the BH via a thin disk whose emission peaks in the UV to soft X-rays. Some of this emission is reprocessed by the unbound stellar debris, producing a spectrum of very broad emission lines (with no corresponding narrow forbidden lines). These lines are the strongest for BHs with MBH ∼ 10 5 − 10 6 M ⊙ and thus optical surveys are particularly sensitive to the lowest mass BHs in galactic nuclei. Calibrating our models to ROSAT and GALEX observations, we predict detection rates for Pan-STARRS, PTF, and LSST and highlight some of the observational challenges associated with studying tidal disruption events in the optical. Upcoming surveys such as Pan-STARRS should detect at least several events per year, and may detect many more if current models of outflows during super-Eddington accretion are reasonably accurate. These surveys will significantly improve our knowledge of stellar dynamics in galactic nuclei, the physics of super-Eddington accretion, the demography of intermediate mass BHs, and the role of tidal disruption in the growth of massive BHs...|$|E
40|$|Massive {{black hole}} {{binaries}} (MBHBs) are a natural byproduct of galaxy mergers. Previous {{studies have shown}} that flares from stellar tidal disruption events (TDEs) are modified by the presence of a secondary perturber, causing interruptions in the light curve. We study the dynamics of TDE debris {{in the presence of a}} milliparsec-separated MBHB by integrating ballistic particle orbits in the time-varying potential of the binary. We find that gaps in the light curve appear when material misses the accretion radius on its first return to pericentre. Subsequent recurrences can be decomposed into "continuous" and "delayed" components, which exhibit different behaviour. We find that this potential can substantially alter the locations of stream self-intersections. When debris is confined to the plane, we find that close encounters with the secondary BH leave noticeable signatures on the <b>fallback</b> <b>rate</b> and can result in significant accretion onto the secondary BH.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{properties of}} material ejected dynamically in {{the merger of}} black hole-neutron star binaries by numerical-relativity simulations. We systematically study the dependence of ejecta properties on the mass ratio of the binary, spin of the black hole, and equation of state of the neutron-star matter. Dynamical mass ejection is driven primarily by tidal torque, and the ejecta is much more anisotropic than that from binary neutron star mergers. In particular, the dynamical ejecta is concentrated around the orbital plane with a half opening angle of 10 [...] 20 deg and often sweeps out only a half of the plane. The ejecta mass can be as large as ~ 0. 1 M_sun, and the velocity is subrelativistic with ~ 0. 2 [...] 0. 3 c for typical cases. The ratio of the ejecta mass to the bound mass (disk and fallback components) is larger, and the ejecta velocity is larger, for larger values of the binary mass ratio, i. e., for larger values of the black-hole mass. The remnant black hole-disk system receives a kick velocity of O(100) km/s due to the ejecta linear momentum, and this easily dominates the kick velocity due to gravitational radiation. Structures of postmerger material, velocity distribution of the dynamical ejecta, <b>fallback</b> <b>rates,</b> and gravitational waves are also investigated.

40|$|Among {{the many}} {{intriguing}} aspects of optically discovered tidal disruption events (TDEs) {{is that their}} temperatures are lower than expected and that the temperature does not evolve as rapidly with decreasing <b>fallback</b> <b>rate</b> {{as would be expected}} in standard disk theory. We show that this can be explained qualitatively using an idea proposed by Laor & Davis in the context of normal active galactic nuclei: that larger accretion rates imply stronger winds and thus that the accretion rate through the inner disk only depends weakly on the inflow rate at {{the outer edge of the}} disk. We also show that reasonable quantitative agreement with data requires that, as has been suggested in recent papers, the circularization radius of the tidal stream is approximately equal to the semimajor axis of the most bound orbit of the debris rather than twice the pericenter distance as would be expected without rapid angular momentum redistribution. If this explanation is correct, it suggests that the evolution of TDEs may test both non-standard disk theory and the details of the interactions of the tidal stream.

40|$|We study {{accretion}} {{processes for}} tidally disrupted stars approaching supermassive black holes on bound orbits, by performing three dimensional Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulations with a pseudo-Newtonian potential. We {{find that there}} is a critical value of the orbital eccentricity below which all the stellar debris remains bound to the black hole. For high but sub-critical eccentricities, all the stellar mass is accreted onto the black hole in a finite time, causing a significant deviation from the canonical $t^{- 5 / 3 }$ mass <b>fallback</b> <b>rate.</b> When a star is on a moderately eccentric orbit and its pericenter distance is deeply inside the tidal disruption radius, there can be several orbit crossings of the debris streams due to relativistic precession. This dissipates orbital energy in shocks, allowing for rapid circularization of the debris streams and formation of an accretion disk. The resultant accretion rate greatly exceeds the Eddington rate and differs strongly from the canonical rate of $t^{- 5 / 3 }$. By contrast, there is little dissipation due to orbital crossings for the equivalent simulation with a purely Newtonian potential. This shows that general relativistic precession is crucial for accretion disk formation via circularization of stellar debris from stars on moderately eccentric orbits.

The precise localization {{at the center of}} a z= 0. 35 galaxy argues for activity of the central engine as the underlying cause. We look at the suggestion by Bloom et al of the possibility of a tidal disruption event (TDE). We argue that Sw 1644 + 57 cannot be explained by the traditional TDE model in which the periastron distance is close to the tidal disruption radius - three independent lines of argument indicate the orbit must be deeply plunging or else the powerful jet we are observing could not be produced. These arguments stem from (i) comparing the early X-ray light curve to the expected theoretical <b>fallback</b> <b>rate,</b> (ii) looking at the time of transition to disk-dominated decay, and (iii) considering the TDE rate. Due to the extreme excess in the tidal force above that which would be required minimally to disrupt the star in a deeply plunging orbit at periastron, we suggest this scenario might be referred to more descriptively as a TOE (tidal obliteration event) rather than a TDE.

Using multistate release-recapture models, I examined the prevalence of overshooting and fallback to home by 37, 806 PIT-tagged steelhead from 14 tributaries of the Columbia River basin in the years 2005 — 2015. For stocks that overshot at rates > 5 %, I used generalized linear models and conditional inference trees to examine the influence of juvenile and adult experiences on overshooting and fallback to home. More than 40 % of adult John Day, Umatilla, Walla Walla, Wenatchee, and Tucannon river steelhead overshot upstream dams. Average annual <b>fallback</b> <b>rates</b> to home ranged from 17. 8 % (SE 1. 9 %) for Walla Walla hatchery steelhead to 75. 0 % (SE 2. 6 %) for Umatilla wild steelhead. Overshooting was associated with factors related to the reservoir environment. Incorrect shoreline orientation within 24 rkm of the natal stream resulted in increased overshooting. Steelhead {{were also more likely}} to overshoot when water temperatures were higher (significant in 5 of 7 tributaries, P < 0. 05). In contrast with adult experiences, juvenile experiences linked to imprinting disruption did not consistently increase overshooting. Hatchery steelhead were more likely to overshoot and less likely to fall back home than their wild counterparts. However, overshooting was only elevated in hatchery stocks reared upstream of release sites. Attraction to upstream areas was decreased with endemic broodstock and long-term acclimation. Juvenile barging was found to decrease overshooting relative to in-river out-migration. Longer ocean residency was associated with increased overshooting, but effects were biologically small. Finally, there was some evidence that spill during March increased fallback to home. A significant positive effect of spill during March was found for hatchery (χ 28 = 15. 82, P = 0. 032) but not for wild steelhead (χ 210 = 12. 87, P = 0. 231) ...|$|R

Through extensive simulation runs by using the Qualnet 5. 0 simulator, proposed scheme is evaluated to show that, this scheme yields higher throughput performance than the ARF scheme...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In the IEEE 802. 11 WLAN standard, the backoff {{algorithm}} {{assumes that}} all losses {{are due to}} collisions, while the automatic <b>rate</b> <b>fallback</b> algorithm assumes that all losses are due to link errors. The coexistence of {{these two types of}} losses in real networks reduces the efficiency of currently used algorithms. We propose a loss-distinguishable MAC layer protocol for 802. 11 WLAN. No PHY layer modification is needed. Analysis shows that the new protocol is effective and has negligible overhead. Index Terms — IEEE 802. 11, WLAN, MAC, protocol, loss distinguishing...|$|R
40|$|We use {{a simple}} {{framework}} {{to calculate the}} time evolution of {{the composition of the}} fallback material onto a supermassive black hole arising from the tidal disruption of main sequence stars. We study stars with masses between 0. 8 and 3. 0 M_, at evolutionary stages from zero-age main sequence to terminal-age main sequence, built using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics code. We show that most stars develop enhancements in nitrogen (^ 14 N) and depletions in carbon (^ 12 C) and oxygen (^ 16 O) over their lifetimes, and that these features are more pronounced for higher mass stars. We find that, in an accretion-powered tidal disruption flare, these features become prominent only after the time of peak of the <b>fallback</b> <b>rate</b> and appear at earlier times for stars of increasing mass. We postulate that no severe compositional changes resulting from the fallback material should be expected near peak {{for a wide range of}} stellar masses and, as such, are unable to explain the extreme helium-to-hydrogen line ratios observed in some TDEs. On the other hand, the resulting compositional changes could help explain the presence of nitrogen-rich features, which are currently only detected after peak. When combined with the shape of the light curve, the time evolution of the composition of the fallback material provides a clear method to help constrain the nature of the disrupted star. This will enable a better characterization of the event by helping break the degeneracy between the mass of the star and the mass of the black hole when fitting tidal disruption light curves.

40|$|At the {{simplest}} level, gravitational sources {{are considered to}} be point-like and in solitude, with a radial force that falls off as r - 2. In reality, all astrophysical objects aside from black holes are extended in space, and can be deformed by the tidal forces arising from the proximity of companion objects with large average densities. When these forces are weak, the response of an object to a tide can be through a decomposition into basis functions, but this approach fails when the tide is strong enough to deform an object by a distance equal to its own size. Under these circumstances, a hydrodynamical representation of the object is required to understand the true tidal response. In this thesis, we present a number of examples of physical systems in which tides dominate the dynamics. First, we consider the case of a star that encounters a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in a deeply penetrating encounter, resulting in a dramatic compression that produces shocks that would be observable in the X-ray. Second, we present the results of hydrodynamical simulations that demonstrate a new mechanism for igniting Type Ia supernovae from binary systems composed of two white dwarfs undergoing Roche-lobe overflow. Third, we investigate the survival prospects of giant planets that have been scattered into highly eccentricity orbits and are exposed to a strong tide applied by their parent star. Fourth, we systematically map the <b>fallback</b> <b>rate</b> resulting from the tidal disruptions of stars by SMBHs. Finally, we use what we have learned about the feeding rate to model determine the highest-likelihood model for an observed prototypical tidal disruption event...|$|E
40|$|We {{construct}} {{a menu of}} objects that can give rise to bright flares when disrupted by massive black holes (BHs), ranging from planets to evolved stars. Through their tidal disruption, main sequence and evolved stars can effectively probe the existence of otherwise quiescent supermassive BHs and white dwarfs can probe intermediate mass BHs. Many low-mass white dwarfs possess extended hydrogen envelopes, which allow {{for the production of}} prompt flares in disruptive encounters with moderately massive BHs of 10 ^ 5 to 10 ^ 7 M_ [...] masses that may constitute the majority of massive BHs by number. These objects are a missing link in two ways: (1) for probing moderately massive BHs and (2) for understanding the hydrodynamics of the disruption of objects with tenuous envelopes. A flare arising from the tidal disruption of a 0. 17 M_ white dwarf by a 10 ^ 5 M_ BH reaches a maximum between 0. 6 and 11 days, with a peak <b>fallback</b> <b>rate</b> that is usually super-Eddington and results in a flare that is likely brighter than a typical tidal disruption event. Encounters stripping only the envelope can provide hydrogen-only fallback, while encounters disrupting the core evolve from H- to He-rich fallback. While most tidal disruption candidates observed thus far are consistent with the disruptions of main sequence stars, the rapid timescales of nuclear transients such as Dougie and PTF 10 iya are naturally explained by the disruption of low-mass white dwarfs. As the number of observed flares continues to increase, the menu presented here will be essential for characterizing nuclear BHs and their environments through tidal disruptions.
