5|$|Reception towards Colin McRae Rally was mixed. The primary {{criticism}} among professional reviewers was {{the lack}} of content and omission of important features. However, the attempt to replicate the driving experience of classic Colin McRae Rally games was complimented. Critics generally believed that the level of difficulty and realistic driving model would appease rally fans and experienced players but might deter beginners. Upon release, the PC version was received negatively by players who were not expecting a mobile <b>game</b> <b>port.</b> The reaction prompted Codemasters to offer refunds to the players.|$|E

At the end of 1962 the Woodville Football Club, based in a neighbouring suburb to Alberton, {{was admitted to the}} SANFL in an attempt to weaken Port Adelaide via taking up some of its suburban recruiting zone. In 1965, Fos Williams coached his last premiership in-front of 62,543 people, the largest ever crowd at Adelaide Oval. In that <b>game</b> <b>Port</b> Adelaide defeat Sturt by 3 points. After the 1965 Grand Final, Port Adelaide would be frustrated by the dominance of Sturt, which won seven premierships over this period under the leadership of Jack Oatey. In all, despite playing in 6 of the next 10 grand finals, Port Adelaide would fail to win a premiership until 1977.|$|E

Since the early 1990s, when the <b>game</b> <b>port</b> moved from dedicated expansion cards to PC I/O or sound cards, these connectors have usually doubled as connectors for MIDI instruments; two of the redundant +5 V and GND pins of the original standard were rededicated to MIDI input and output to make this possible. To use a <b>game</b> <b>port</b> with MIDI instruments a cable is required with a male and a female DA-15 and two male 5-pin DIN connectors. The drivers and hardware for the <b>game</b> <b>port</b> midi capabilities are based around the now standard Roland MPU-401 MIDI interface (in UART mode only).|$|E

PCs of this era did not include a <b>game</b> <b>port.</b> <b>Game</b> <b>port</b> cards were costly (around $50) and used one of the few expansion slots PCs had at the time. Given the choice between an AdLib card or a fully compatible Sound Blaster card that came with a <b>game</b> <b>port,</b> saved a slot, and included the [...] "DSP" [...] for not much more in price, many consumers opted for the Sound Blaster.
