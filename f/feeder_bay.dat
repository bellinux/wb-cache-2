40|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the problem of flow collision of the integrative information transmission in the switched Ethernet for substation process-level (SESPL), this paper proposed a novel priority-based transfer scheme in the end-nodes {{based on the information}} model, in which different priorities are assigned according to different information types by using the user priority field defined in the standard IEEE 802. 1, and first-come-first-served (FCFS) and static priority queuing (SPQ) scheduling algorithms are used in the switch and end-nodes respectively. An implementation method through introducing a prioritization mechanism into the protocol stacks is presented. Case study on a typical substation <b>feeder</b> <b>bay</b> verifies the validity and feasibility of the proposed schemer...|$|E
40|$|Single Wire Earth Return (SWER) {{systems are}} a widely applied, low cost {{electrification}} method {{used in many}} rural areas. In Central Queensland a single SWER system supplying approximately 100 kW may extend more than 300 km. Many SWER systems include shunt reactors to control {{the effects of the}} line charging capacitance. One effect, the Ferranti effect, causes the line voltage to rise with the distance. In three phase distribution systems this effect is not visible but in SWER systems, this effect makes it difficult to maintain the consumers supply within the acceptable regulation range. As the second effect, the loading of the SWER system supply transformer increases. Controllable shunt reactors are used as one solution to the aforementioned problems. Stanage <b>Bay</b> <b>feeder</b> in Central Queensland area has been chosen for the installation of the designed shunt reactor. Stange <b>Bay</b> <b>feeder</b> is supplied by an isolating transformer with the total capacity of 150 kVA and the voltage level of 22 kV. Using the Stanage <b>Bay</b> <b>feeder,</b> this paper details the process of design and simulation of a suitable switch reactor. This step has been carried out by firstly, the design of the switch reactor and secondly, the proper modelling of the designed reactor for the voltage regulation studies...|$|R

Their passengers would have to travel north by rail. Union Airways under their postal contract collected mail from the overnight Limited Express train at Palmerston {{and took it to}} the South Island and required no air link to Auckland. The board [...] "caused perturbation" [...] in the North Island by noting the most important trunk route would be between Palmerston North and Dunedin. Later newspapers produced articles about the working time saved by an Auckland businessman heading for Christchurch and travelling to Palmerston North by overnight train when compared with a flight originating in Auckland the following morning which would land him in Christchurch much later that day.|$|R
40|$|Substations (HV/MV) connect {{transmission}} and distribution systems with consumers of electric energy. The selective search method was used for calculation of substation reliability, where all arrangement elements were grouped into blocks. Subject of the analysis was H-arrangements comprising air-insulated switchgears on the high voltage side of HV/MV substations with different number of <b>feeder</b> and transformer <b>bays</b> and diverse scope of the installed switching equipment. Failure rate and duration were used as main HV/MV substation equipment reliability indices. A large number of arrangements were classified into groups, and within a group the arrangements were ranked {{with the use of}} multiple criteria. It is shown that the reliability of the electricity transit depends on the equipment of field for the transit of electricity, which favors poorly equipped field. On the other hand, the reliability of transformation of the full power depends mostly on the equipment in coupling field. It is essential that in the coupling field, {{there are at least two}} disconnectors. Installation of the switch in the coupling field is meaningful only with appropriate protection, because it further improves reliability. Conclusions are drawn for phased construction and expansion of the single pole diagram with an additional field for the transmission line...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{an urgent}} need for an {{international}} protocol for power protection and substation automation, the International Electrotechnical Committee (IEC) and Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) agreed to collaborate together to advance the existing communication protocols for substation automation system (SAS). The objectives were to achieve interoperability and free configuration in a multi-vendor environment substation. The outcome of this agreement was to announce {{the first edition of}} the IEC 61850 Standard as an international standard in 2004. The standard incorporates the use of logical nodes to resolve problems related to interoperability and interchangeability in multi-vendor zone substation systems. The standard also initiated a cost-effective Generic Object Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) messaging technology to replace the traditional copper wiring. The second edition of the IEC 61850 Standard was published in 2014 which is encapsulated in a series of 20 documents spanning over ten sections. The last few years has seen numerous studies pointing to the IEC 61850 as a worthwhile international standard for substation automation system. There is still, nevertheless, resistance from utilities to welcoming the IEC 61850 implementation. This may perhaps be {{due to the lack of}} knowledge that engineers have about the standard and/or because of several ambiguous topics that still are not addressed in detail in the context of IEC 61850. Furthermore, it should go without saying that, the GOOSE technology has brought several benefits to the power protection and communication systems in the field of substation automation. However, the lack of tools and knowledge to take advantage of the GOOSE messaging technology in IEC 61850 -based zone substations is tangible. For instance, in order to test an Intelligent Electronic Device (IED), isolating a GOOSE message from substation is a main industrial challenge for engineers. When an IED is isolated from live substation for test purposes, its GOOSE message is not isolated yet, and the IED under test is still publishing the GOOSE trip signal to other IEDs. In order to isolate the GOOSE trip signal for IED test purposes, each vendor implements its own method and they use their proprietary configurator tools. This means that, engineers are desperately dealing with a lack of comprehensive tool or method to isolate the GOOSE trip signal in a multi-vendor zone substation. These challenges led to the slow migration of the standard into substations. Having acknowledged these difficulties and challenges the spotlight is seemingly in the path of developing a tool or program to be utilised for GOOSE isolation and GOOSE management in a multi-vendor relay environment. In doing that, a 66 / 22 kV Distribution Terminal Zone Substation is implemented accompanied with a SCADA centre as a model of an IEC 61850 -based Substation. Two bays with separate 66 kV sub-transmission lines, 66 / 22 kV step down transformers, 22 kV Bus 1 with Bus Tie Circuit Breaker and three 22 kV <b>feeders</b> per <b>bay</b> have been considered for the simulation. In the construction of the Substation Simulator, the aim is to take advantage of the IEC 61850 GOOSE messaging technology for protection, control, monitoring and communication purposes. Hence, the hardwire connections are replaced by GOOSE signals through optic cables as much as possible. This thesis will not only provide the design and configuration procedures of this substation, but also will cover the difficulties that engineers may encounter in IEC 61850 -based substations systems in terms of device configuration, testing and maintenance. In order to fully understand the concept of the 66 / 22 kV Distribution Terminal Zone Substation, it is very essential to be familiar with the structure of communication protocols and the IEC 61850 Standard. This thesis starts by exploring a synopsis of communication protocols and their development over the time. It elucidates core elements of telemetry communications, structures of protocols and the significance of standards for communication protocols within substation automation systems. This is followed by a comprehensive exploration of the fundamentals of the IEC 61850 -based substations. In particular, it will cover the GOOSE messaging technology and interoperability in a multi-vendor substation environment. The author also addresses the difficulties that engineers may encounter in IEC 61850 -based substations systems in terms of device configuration, testing and maintenance...|$|R
