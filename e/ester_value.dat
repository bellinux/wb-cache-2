The only extract which resembled rather closely in its nature the Riebeck crude montan wax was obtained by benzene extraction from Ptolemais lignite. The most significant differences between benzene extracts from Greek lignites and Riebeck crude montan wax were the differences in melting points and the greater resin content of the Greek waxes.

40|$|Isothermal {{microtitration}} calorimetry {{was performed}} to analyze the interaction of fucoidan and dextran sulfate with toluidine blue O (TB) to achieve relevant and characteristic thermodynamic information. Thermodynamic data obtained were referred to the anionic binding sites of the sulfated polysaccharides (SPS) and were {{not related to the}} polysaccharide concentration in general. Enthalpic values achieved by the two SPS titrations in TB solutions could be approximated using a single fit curve. The same also applies for the TB titrations in SPS solutions. Evaluation of the data obtained for forward and reverse titrations could not be performed since it results in inconsistent enthalpic and entropic contributions. An appropriate modeling could only be performed assuming two non-symmetric binding sites at the SPS although the thermodynamic data revealed a 1 : 1 stoichiometry. A 1 : 2 model accounts for the deviation generated by the stacking of the TB molecules. Data obtained for the binding of a single TB to a sulfate ester indicate highly negative values (− 9. 7 to − 9. 4 kcal mol− 1) for the change in Gibbs energy and thus a spontaneous enthalpy-driven reaction.

For non-electrolyze process, variable used is patchouli leaves to solvent ratio 1 : 10, 1 : 15, 1 : 20, and pH 4 and 6. For electrolyze process, it used the same condition as non- electrolyze with voltages 3. 6. 9. and 12 volt. The extractive process occurred in an hour with temperature 80 °C. In conclusion, the highest yield about 8. 5 % for ratio 1 : 10 and pH 4 for non-electrolyze process and 12. 3 % for ratio 1 : 10, pH 4 and 9 Vfbr electrolyze process. The energy cost gives each kg ofpatchouli oil is 183, 775 IDR base on highest yield. If We compare the energy cost to selling price ofpatchouli oil with market quality, it has good properties to SN 1 (The National Standard Quality of Indonesia) No. SAFI 06 - 2385 - 1991.

40|$|Oil was {{extracted}} from Terminalia belerica Roxb. seed kernel by solvent extraction process. The whole seed contained 12. 28 % oil on dry basis. The physico-chemical {{properties of the}} oil were determined. Moisture, ash and crude fibre contents of the seed kernel {{were found to be}} 8. 43, 2. 54, and 8. 78 % respectively. The refractive index, co-efficient of viscosity, specific gravity, and energy of activation of the oil were found to be 1. 28, 403. 6 millipoise at 30 o C, 0. 93 and 6. 97 k. cal/mole respectively. The oil was found to be non-drying. Iodine value, acid value, peroxide value, saponification value, saponification equivalent, <b>ester</b> <b>value,</b> unsaponifiable matter, acetyl value, Reichert-Meissel value, Polenske value, free fatty acids as oleic acid and cholesterol content of the oil were recorded as 107, 3. 69, 3. 14, 189. 24, 296. 44, 185. 55, 1. 24 %, 3. 78, 0. 719, 0. 945, 0. 87 % and 26. 59 mg per 100 g oil, respectively. The oil was qualitative and quantitative analysed for fatty acid composition by TLC and GLC. The results showed that the fatty acids of the oil had chain length between C 14 to C 22. The oil contained 17. 70 % myristic acid, 21. 6 % palmitic acid, 45. 67 % oleic acid and 14. 93 % stearic acid. The whole kernel was analyzed for some nutrients and minerals.

Objective {{of this study was to}} determine proximate and antinutritional characteristics of seeds as well as the physicochemical characteristics of brebra seed oil. Crude oil, protein, fiber, ash, moisture and carbohydrate content of brebra were 48.5 [*]±[*] 0.99 %, 29.7 [*]±[*] 0.23 %, 2.41 [*]±[*] 0.12 %, 3.24 [*]±[*] 0 %, 4.24 [*]±[*] 0.04 % and 11.92 [*]±[*] 0.2 %, respectively. Seed has concentrated energy (6.0298 Kcal/gm). The respective tannin, oxalate and phytic acid value were 84.3 [*]±[*] 0.89  mg/ 100 gm, 20.97 [*]±[*] 0.36  mg/ 100 gm and 291.62 [*]±[*] 0.87  mg/ 100 gm, respectively. Cyanide was not detected in the sample. Seed contains high concentration of phosphorus (1062.1 [*]±[*] 0.3  mg/ 100  g), potassium (281 [*]±[*] 0.1  mg/ 100  g), magnesium (112.38 [*]±[*] 0.1  mg/g), sodium (93.26 [*]±[*] 0.1  mg/g) and calcium (61.55 [*]±[*] 0.01  mg/g). The oil was analyzed for specific gravity at 20 °C, viscosity at 40 °C, refractive index at 40 °C, acid value, saponification value, iodine value, peroxide value and <b>ester</b> <b>value.</b> Their respective values were 0.942, 40.59  mm 2 /s, 1.473, 0.39  mg KOH/g, 174.95  mg KOH/g, 104.48 gI 2 / 100  g, 6.88 and 174.56  mg KOH/g. Unsaturated fatty acids accounts (80.7 %), of which 48.2 % and 27.7 % were linolcic and linolenic, respectively, which make suitable for production of biodiesel. Seed has higher nutrient composition, low antinutritional elements and high calorie value compared to some legumes.|$|E
40|$|Strontium {{zirconate}} oxide was synthesized by co-precipitation and the citrate {{route and}} was evaluated as a heterogeneous catalyst for biodiesel production. The catalyst samples {{were characterized by}} XRD, FTIR, and TG, and catalytic activity was measured based on the ester content of the biodiesel produced that was quantified by GC. The co-precipitate samples were obtained in alkaline pH and had a mixture of the perovskite and pure strontium and zirconium oxide phases. Ester conversion using these samples was approximately 1. 6 %, indicating no catalytic activity. The citrate route was more efficient in producing perovskite when carried out at pH 7 - 8; excess SrCO 3 {{was found on the}} catalyst surface due to CO 2 adsorption, thus demonstrating no catalytic activity. The same synthesis carried out at pH 2 resulted in free OH- groups, {{with a small amount of}} the carbonate species that produced <b>ester</b> yield <b>values</b> of 98 %. Therefore, matrices based on strontium zirconate produced via the citrate route in acidic media are potential heterogeneous catalysts for transesterification. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Palm oil esters (POEs), {{which are}} newly {{synthetic}} liquid wax <b>esters</b> with HLB <b>value</b> of 9. 34, were proposed as a lipophilic phase for formation of nanoemulsion. Phase diagrams show domination of two-phase regions at all emulsification temperatures ranging from 30 to 80 Â°C. Spontaneous and temperature-induced emulsification, high-shear and high pressure homogenization were utilized to form nanoemulsion. However, only high pressure homogenization successfully produced droplets sizes in the nano range. Thus, {{it was used}} to optimize the stability properties of POEs nanoemulsion.

40|$|The {{physicochemical}} {{properties and}} fatty acid composition of Attalea dubia (Mart.) Burret (indaiá) seed oil were investigated. The oil was extracted in a soxhlet apparatus using petroleum ether and evaluated for iodine, acid, peroxide, <b>ester,</b> and saponification <b>values.</b> The oil was also analyzed using infrared and {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} spectroscopy. The fatty acid profile of the oil was determined by GC-MS. For each analysis indaiá oil was compared to Orbignya phalerata (babassu) oil. The two oils appeared to be very similar in their fatty acid composition, in which lauric acid (the most abundant), myristic acid, caprylic acid, and capric acid were the four main fatty acids detected. The unsaturated fatty acids content was lower for indaiá oil (5. 8 %) than for babassu oil (9. 4 %). The results suggest that indaiá palm tree could be cultivated as {{a new source of}} vegetable oil with potential for food and cosmetic industries...|$|R
