Clear-sky OLR can be {{measured}} from satellites by examining the data to detect clouds, eliminating those observations that are contaminated with clouds, and averaging the remaining data. The disadvantage of this method is that satellites do not provide time continuous coverage, requiring many observations and careful analysis to remove sampling biases. Alternatively, clear-sky OLR can be found continuously using a radiative <b>flux</b> <b>code,</b> combined with analyzed fields of temperature, humidity and clouds, either from assimilated observations or a GCM simulation.

The situation changes drastically when the ion implantation is performed under channeling conditions, i. e., when the ion beam is aligned with a major crystal axis during implantation. A target temperature of 450 degrees C is sufficient for recovery {{of a majority of}} implantation-related defects, resulting in an RBS-channeling minimum yield of 13 % after implantation, MARLOWE simulations have been performed to explain the difference between non-channeled and channeled implantation. High temperature annealing of such samples results in the formation of continuous rare-earth silicide layers of high structural quality. Polar axial scans around the perpendicular axis result in a minimum yield of 1. 5 % in the Er signal. In the Si signal, however, a value of 20 % is found.

40|$|International audiencePurpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a new hybrid Euler flux {{fonction}} for use in a finite-volume Euler/Navier-Stokes code and adapted to compressible flow problems. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed scheme, called AUFSRR can be devised by combining the AUFS solver and the Roe solver, based on a rotated Riemann solver approach (Sun and Takayama, 2003; Ren, 2003). The upwind direction is determined by the velocity-difference vector and idea is to apply the AUFS solver in the direction normal to shocks to suppress carbuncle and the Roe solver across shear layers to avoid an excessive amount of dissipation. The resulting flux functions can be implemented in a very simple manner, in the form of the Roe solver with modified wave speeds, so that converting an existing AUFS <b>flux</b> <b>code</b> into the new fluxes is an extremely simple task. Findings - The proposed flux functions require about 18 per cent more CPU time than the Roe flux. Accuracy, efficiency and other essential features of AUFSRR scheme are evaluated by analyzing shock propagation behaviours for both the steady and unsteady compressible flows. This is demonstrated by several test cases (1 D and 2 D) with standard finite-volume Euler code, by comparing results with existing methods.

Elasticities for many reversible rate laws can be computed from the reaction Gibbs free energies, which are determined by the state, and from physically unconstrained saturation values. Starting from a network structure with allosteric regulation and consistent metabolic fluxes and concentrations, one can sample the elasticities, compute the control coefficients, and reconstruct a kinetic model with consistent reversible rate laws. Some of the model variables are manually chosen, fitted to data, or optimised, while the others are computed from them. The resulting model ensemble allows for probabilistic predictions, for instance, about possible dynamic behaviour. By adding more data or tighter constraints, the predictions can be made more precise. Model variants differing in network structure, flux distributions, thermodynamic forces, regulation, or rate laws can be realised by different model ensembles and compared by significance tests.

Intrinsic rotation {{is determined by the}} balance between the momentum redistribution and the turbulent diffusion and convection. Two different turbulence regimes are considered: turbulence with characteristic perpendicular lengths of the order of the ion gyroradius, ρi, and turbulence with characteristic lengths of the order of the poloidal gyroradius, (B/Bp) ρi. Intrinsic rotation driven by gyroradius scale turbulence is mainly due to the effect of neoclassical corrections and of finite orbit widths on turbulent momentum transport, whereas for the intrinsic rotation driven by poloidal gyroradius scale turbulence, the slow variation of turbulence characteristics in the radial and poloidal directions and the turbulent particle acceleration can be become as important as the neoclassical and finite orbit width effects. The magnetic drift is shown to be indispensable for the intrinsic rotation driven by the slow variation of turbulence characteristics and the turbulent particle acceleration.

We used a realistic spectrum of injected electrons provided by the stochastic acceleration model, which has a smooth transition from a quasi-thermal background at low energies to a nonthermal tail at high energies. The inclusion of low-energy electrons results in relatively more heating in the corona (vs. chromosphere), a larger downward conductive flux, and thus a stronger chromospheric evaporation than obtained in previous studies, which had a deficit in low-energy electrons due to an arbitrarily assumed low-energy cutoff. The energy and spatial distributions of energetic electrons and bremsstrahlung photons bear signatures of the changing density distribution caused by chromospheric evaporation.

The fixed spatial structure of TAE modes hmn(s) (s = (r/a) 2 is in this paper a normalised toroidal (or can be also a poloidal in some <b>codes)</b> <b>flux</b> function, a is a minor plasma radius) is calculated with the KINX and MISHKA codes. The fast particle dynamics, TAE growthrates and wave saturation levels are computed with the HAGIS and VENUS+df orbit following codes...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{considerable}} {{effort has}} been devoted to the development of computer codes being able to simulate the CVD process. Improved modelling techniques and better understanding of reaction and transport phenomena during deposition are needed {{to bridge the gap between}} general knowledge and new process requirements. The general finite element <b>code</b> <b>Flux</b> Expert has been adapted to heat and mass transfer problems in CVD. With built in graphics and fully interactivity, a broad range of users may easily solve some of their CVD problems. Our aim in the example presented was to simulate the growth rate uniformity of chromium carbide coatings deposited inside a tube from organometallic precursors. We clearly show the influence of the injector geometry on the uniformity. Even if the chemistry of the examples discussed was simple, the agreement between experimental and theoretical values is rather good; the two dimensional approximation of the hole bored injector seems also to be adequate to describe the geometry...|$|R
40|$|Nucleate boiling {{is a very}} {{effective}} heat transfer cooling process, used in numerous industrial applications. Despite intensive research over decades, a reliable model of nucleate pool boiling is still not available. This paper presents a numerical and experimental investigation of nucleate boiling from artificial nucleation sites. The numerical investigation described {{in the first section}} of the paper is carried out by a hybrid mechanistic numerical code first developed at the University of Ljubljana to simulate the temperature field in a heated stainless steel plate with a large number of nucleation sites during pool boiling of water at atmospheric pressure. It is now being redeveloped to interpret experiments on pool boiling at artificial sites on a silicon plate and as a design tool to investigate different arrangements of sites to achieve high heat <b>fluxes.</b> The <b>code</b> combines full simulation of the temperature field in the solid wall with simplified models or correlations for processes in the liquid-vapour region. The current capabilities and limitations of the code are reviewed and improvements are discussed. Examples are given of the removal of computational constraints on the activation of sites in close proximity and improvements to the bubble growth model. Preliminary simulations are presented to compare the wall conditions {{to be used in the}} experiments on silicon at Edinburgh University with the conditions in current experiments on thin metal foils at Ljubljana. An experimental rig for boiling experiments with artificial cavities on a 0. 38 mm thick silicon wafer immersed in FC- 72, developed at Edinburgh University, is described in the second part of the paper...|$|R
