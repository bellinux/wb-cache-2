25|$|Pesticide {{leaching}} {{occurs when}} pesticides mix {{with water and}} move through the soil, ultimately contaminating groundwater. The amount of leaching is correlated with particular soil and pesticide characteristics {{and the degree of}} rainfall and irrigation. Leaching is most likely to happen if using a water-soluble pesticide, when the soil tends to be sandy in texture; if excessive watering occurs just after pesticide application; if the adsorption ability of the pesticide to the soil is low. Leaching may not only originate from treated fields, but also from pesticide mixing areas, pesticide application machinery washing sites, or <b>disposal</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Installation {{of solar}} power PV plants require nearly 2.0 {{hectares}} (5 acres) land per MW capacity {{which is similar}} to coal-fired power plants [...] when life cycle coal mining, consumptive water storage & ash <b>disposal</b> <b>areas</b> are also accounted and hydro power plants when submergence area of water reservoir is also accounted. 1.6 million MW capacity solar plants can be installed in India on its 1% land (32,000 square km). There are vast tracts of land suitable for solar power in all parts of India exceeding 8% of its total area which are unproductive barren and devoid of vegetation. Part of waste lands (32,000 square km) when installed with solar power plants can produce 2400 billion kWh of electricity (two times the total generation in 2013-14) with land productivity/yield of 0.9 million Rs per acre (3 Rs/kWh price) which is at par with many industrial areas and many times more than the best productive irrigated agriculture lands. Moreover, these solar power units are not dependent on supply of any raw material and are self productive. There is unlimited scope for solar electricity to replace all fossil fuel energy requirements (natural gas, coal, lignite and crude oil) if all the marginally productive lands are occupied by solar power plants in future. The solar power potential of India can meet perennially to cater per capita energy consumption at par with USA/Japan for the peak population in its demographic transition.|$|E

40|$|According to the United States Department of Energy, fossil-fueled {{power plants}} account for 78 % of {{stationary}} source CO 2 emission in the United States and Canada. This has led electric utilities {{across the globe}} to research different alternatives for energy. Carbon sequestration {{has been identified as}} a bridge between fossil fuels and clean energy. This thesis will present research results regarding the transportation costs of CO 2 and the suitability of geology in the Florida Pan-Handle for sequestration infrastructure. The thesis will utilize various evaluation tools including GIS, numerical models, and optimization models. Analysis performed for this thesis and review of published literature produced estimated carbon storage capacities for two areas in and near the Florida Pan-Handle. These <b>areas</b> were labeled <b>Disposal</b> <b>Area</b> 1 and <b>Disposal</b> <b>Area</b> 3. <b>Disposal</b> <b>Area</b> 1 was estimated to contain capacity for the storage of 5. 58 gigatonnes of CO 2. <b>Disposal</b> <b>Area</b> 3 was estimated to contain capacity for the storage of 2. 02 gigatonnes of CO 2. Transportation scenarios were analyzed over a 25 year period and the capacities above are sufficient to store the CO 2 emissions from the Pan-Handle network of power plants for the study period. Four transportation routing scenarios were investigated using transportation costs from the Poiencot and Brown CO 2 pipeline capital cost model. The scenarios (models) consisted of the Right-Of-Way, Solo-Funded, Piece-Wise, and Authority models. Each presents a different method for the overall funding of the Florida Pan-Handle CO 2 network and produced different total levelized and mean unit costs.
