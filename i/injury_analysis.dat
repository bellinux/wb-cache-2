This article describes a mixed Weibull model which is proposed as an alternative model of occupational <b>injury</b> <b>analysis.</b> This model assumes that a worker will suffer injuries during employment with a probability [gamma] (0 < [gamma] < 1). The conditional failure time model is defined to be a Weibull distribution.

40|$|After {{peripheral}} nerve injuries patients lose {{and do not}} recover the stretch reflex which leads to altered locomotor function. The focus of this thesis is to investigate the structural integrity of the central connection between Ia afferents and alpha motoneurons that mediate the stretch reflex. The overall hypothesis is that the density and distribution of Ia synapses on motoneurons is altered after {{peripheral nerve}} <b>injuries.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of Ia afferent-motoneuron contacts, revealed by vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT 1) immunoreactivity, on the soma and dendritic arbor of motoneurons after peripheral nerve injuries revealed major reorganizations in the distribution and density of Ia synapses. Synaptic stripping of Ia afferent synapses occurred on the soma and proximal dendrites {{and appeared to be}} permanent even after reinnervation; in contrast, VGLUT 1 synapses on distal dendrites were unchanged. In conclusion, after peripheral nerve injuries motoneurons are contacted by fewer Ia synapses and they are more distally located. This overall reorganization likely weakens the input and may contribute to stretch reflex anomalies...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the compliance dispute brought by India alleging lack of compliance by the European Communities with an earlier WTO ruling on anti-dumping duties for cotton-type bed linen. India raised some {{issues relating to}} the EC treatment of “other factors ” {{in the conduct of}} its <b>injury</b> <b>analysis</b> that India had briefly noted in the original proceeeding but had not argued in full. India further claimed that the EC was in violation of WTO rules by treating all imports from firms not individually investigated {{as if they had been}} dumping when conducting its revised <b>injury</b> <b>analysis,</b> even though some of the firms individually investigated were found not to be dumping. We suggest that the first of these issues raises some interesting questions about the proper scope of res judicata, issue preclusion, and waiver in WTO jurisprudence. To highlight these questions, we develop a novel analytical model to compare expected litigation costs in a judicial system with a rule of waiver, to those in a system in which litigants can bring multiple claims. We show that a rule of waiver need not minimize litigation costs, because some disputes can be resolved at lower cost if a claimant is not forced to bring all of its arguments at once. On the question of the legality of treating all uninvestigated firms as if they engaged in dumping in the course of <b>injury</b> <b>analysis,</b> we conclude that the Appellate Body’s decision has some economic appeal, but it rests on shaky legal foundation...|$|E

40|$|Work {{injury is}} one of the major {{obstacles}} in manufacturing industries especially in production assembly systems all over the world. Work injuries reduce production efficiency and threat human health. Among various types of work injuries, repetitive work injuries are the one that can be easily neglected. This thesis is about the application of computing technology to analysis and synthesis of repetitive work injuries in production assembly systems for the purpose of reduction or elimination of these injuries. A production assembly system consists of the assembly machines, products, tools, humans (workers), and particular environments. Injuries of the worker are basically caused by over stress, strain, and fatigue, which are further related to the worker’s posture. This research proposed a general methodology for constructing a software system for analysis and simulation of a worker’s postures in a virtual environment. The implementation of such a computer system was discussed. This research also proposed methods to compute work injury cost. Finally, this research proposed a more systematic method for the synthesis or re-design of worker’ postures to reduce or eliminate work injuries. The major contribution of this thesis work is to advance computing to work <b>injury</b> <b>analysis</b> and synthesis in production systems. This thesis study concludes that the computer technology is matured enough to highly automate the process of work <b>injury</b> <b>analysis</b> and synthesis. It is possible that a complete design of production systems with consideration of work injuries can be done in a much more efficient manner – perhaps reduction of the ramp-up process in the automobile industry from 6 months (typically) to one month in addition to the removal of wasted materials and potential injuries in the ramp-up process...|$|E
