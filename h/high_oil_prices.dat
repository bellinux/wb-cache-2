5|$|A {{number of}} events in 2006 pushed {{renewable}} energy up the political agenda, including the US mid-term elections in November, which confirmed clean energy as a mainstream issue. Also in 2006, the Stern Review made a strong economic case for investing in low carbon technologies now, and argued that economic growth need not be incompatible with cutting energy consumption. According to a trend analysis from the United Nations Environment Programme, climate change concerns coupled with recent <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> and increasing government support are driving increasing rates of investment in the renewable energy and energy efficiency industries.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the {{sustained}} rise {{in oil prices}} had only a limited impact on demand. It was a good year across all segments of the tanker market segments, but {{not as good as}} 2004 and 2005. Amidst <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> <b>prices,</b> geopolitical tension, and fears of disruptions to the oil supply, growing demand was the main driving force in the tanker shipping market for the year. As demand grew moderately in the United States and Western Europe, expanding economies such as China fueled exponential growth in demand. Despite these strengths, each of the five tanker freight indices dropped during 2006. Product tanker demand increased in 2006 due to economic expansion in Asia, especially China and India, however, average time charter equivalent earnings for these ships decreased compared with the two prior years.|$|E
5|$|For many net oil {{importing}} {{countries the}} 2000s energy crisis brought back concerns first raised during the 1973 oil crisis. For the United States, the other developed countries and emerging countries {{their dependence on}} foreign oil has revived concerns about their vulnerability to price shocks and supply disruption. Also, there have been concerns about the uncertainty surrounding peak oil production and the higher cost of extracting unconventional oil. A third issue that has been raised is the threat to national security because most proven oil reserves are concentrated in relatively few geographic locations, including some countries with strong resource nationalism, unstable governments or hostile to U.S. interests. In addition, for many developing countries, and particularly for the poorest African countries, <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> have an adverse impact on the government budget and deteriorate their terms of trade thus jeopardizing their balance of payments, all leading to lower economic growth.|$|E
40|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>prices</b> are {{notoriously}} hard to predict, {{but they are}} an important input in many energy and economic models. This paper explores the effects of different <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> assumptions on natural gas markets (production, consumption, prices in different regions) in the International Natural Gas Model (INGM). Three cases from the INGM are presented: a reference case, a <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> case and a second <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> case, where gas-to-liquids (GTL) capacity additions are constrained. The results show that regardless of constraints on GTL capacity additions, <b>higher</b> <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> lead to <b>higher</b> production and consumption of natural gas. However, when GTL capacity is allowed to expand, <b>higher</b> <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> generally lead to higher natural gas prices and to less gas consumption in the electric power and industrial sectors as they switch to cheaper fuels and more natural gas is diverted {{to the production of}} GTLs. ...|$|R

In {{the early days of}} the city, gold and silver booms and busts played a large role in the city's economic success. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the energy crisis in America and resulting <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> created an energy boom in Denver captured in the soap opera Dynasty. Denver was built up considerably during this time with the construction of many new downtown skyscrapers. When the price of oil dropped from $34 a barrel in 1981 to $9 a barrel in 1986, the Denver economy also dropped, leaving almost 15,000 oil industry workers in the area unemployed (including former mayor and current governor John Hickenlooper, a former geologist), and the nation's highest office vacancy rate (30%). The industry has recovered and the region has 700 employed petroleum engineers. Advances in hydraulic fracturing have made the DJ Basin of Colorado into an accessible and lucrative oil play. Energy and mining are still important in Denver's economy today, with companies such as EnCana, Halliburton, Smith International, Rio Tinto Group, Newmont Mining, Noble Energy, and Anadarko headquartered or having significant operations.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{a series}} of vector {{autoregression}} (VAR) models are developed to empirically evaluate the effects of <b>higher</b> <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> on macroeconomic performance in Canada.

Although in economic theory, GDP should equal GDI, in reality these two measures differ. The significant upsurge in real commodity prices over the last decade, coupled with the lower cost of imported consumer goods from emerging markets, have led to large improvements in our terms of trade and generated large gains in real income. This is not accounted for under real GDP calculations. Therefore, when analyzing the effect of <b>higher</b> <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> on the Canadian economy, this paper finds that real GDI may be a more appropriate variable to use instead of real GDP and concludes that <b>higher</b> <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> are ultimately good for the economy...|$|R

In contrast, a <b>high</b> crude <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> has two opposite effects. On the one hand, <b>higher</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> implies large production cost and hence its effect is expected to be negative. On the other hand, <b>higher</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> imply larger demand for biofuel, and hence for corn, and hence its acreage effect is positive.

40|$|Crude <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> have {{dramatically}} {{increased over the}} past years and are now at a historical maximum in nominal terms and very close to it in real terms. It is difficult to argue, at least for net <b>oil</b> importers, that <b>higher</b> <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> {{have a positive impact on}} welfare. In fact, the negative relationship between <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> and economic activity has been well documented in the literature. Yet, to the extent that <b>higher</b> <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> lead to lower oil consumption, it would be possible to argue that not all the effects of a price increase are negative. Climate change concerns have been on the rise in recent years and fossil fuel consumption is generally viewed as one of the main causes behind it. Thus this paper explores whether <b>higher</b> <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> contribute to lowering oil intensities (that is, oil consumption per unit of gross domestic product). The findings show that following an increase in <b>oil</b> <b>prices,</b> OECD countries tend to reduce oil intensity. However, the same result does not hold for Latin America (and more generally for middle-income countries) where oil intensities appear to be unaffected by <b>oil</b> <b>prices.</b> The paper also explores why this is so.

25|$|Starting {{with the}} 1973–74 Arab oil embargo against the West, {{a period of}} {{prolonged}} <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> set in that characterised {{the rest of the}} 1970s. Romania as a major oil-producer greatly benefited from the <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> of the 1970s, which led Ceaușescu to embark on an ambitious plan to invest heavily in oil-refining plants. Ceaușescu's plan was to make Romania into Europe's number one oil refiner not only of its oil, but also of oil from Middle Eastern states like Iraq and Iran, and then to sell all of the refined oil at a profit on the Rotterdam spot market. As Romania lacked the money to build the necessary oil refining plants and Ceaușescu chose to spend the windfall from the <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> on aid to the Third World in an attempt to buy Romania international influence, Ceaușescu borrowed heavily from Western banks on the assumption that when the loans came due, the profits from the sales of the refined oil would be more than enough to pay off the loans. A major problem with Ceaușescu's oil-refining plan which led to Romania taking enormous loans was the low productivity of Romanian workers, which meant that the oil-refining plants were finished years behind schedule. The 1977 earthquake which destroyed much of Bucharest also led to delays in the oil plan. By the time the oil refining plants were finished in the early 1980s, a slump in oil prices had set in, leading to major financial problems for Romania.|$|E
40|$|Using a {{comprehensive}} global dataset, we outline stylized facts characterizing relationships between crude <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> and macroeconomic developments across the world.

While cross-country differences in impact are found to depend mainly on the relative size of oil imports, we also show that <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> shocks are not always costly for oil-importing countries: although <b>higher</b> <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> increase the import bill, there are partly offsetting increases in external receipts.
