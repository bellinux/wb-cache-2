5|$|The Internet is a {{worldwide}} network {{of computers and}} computer networks that {{communicate with each other}} using the <b>Internet</b> <b>Protocol.</b> Any computer on the Internet has a unique IP address that can be used by other computers to route information to it. Hence, any computer on the Internet can send a message to any other computer using its IP address. These messages carry with them the originating computer's IP address allowing for two-way communication. The Internet is thus an exchange of messages between computers.|$|E

Two of her superiors had discussed not taking her to Iraq; it was felt she was a risk to herself and possibly others, according to a statement later issued by the Army—but the shortage of intelligence analysts dictated their decision to take her. In November 2009, she was promoted from Private First Class to Specialist.|$|E

5|$|In December 1999, RFC 2732 {{provided}} a minor update to RFC 2396, allowing URIs to accommodate IPv6 addresses. A number of shortcomings {{discovered in the}} two specifications led to a community effort, coordinated by RFC 2396 co-author Roy Fielding, that culminated in the publication of RFC 3986 in January 2005. While obsoleting the prior standard, it did not render the details of existing URL schemes obsolete; RFC 1738 continues to govern such schemes except where otherwise superseded. RFC 2616 for example, refines the http scheme. Simultaneously, the IETF published the content of RFC 3986 as the full standard STD 66, reflecting {{the establishment of the}} URI generic syntax as an official <b>Internet</b> <b>protocol.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Terrestrial Trunked Radio {{network has}} three {{components:}} the core net, {{which is a}} centralized computer center based on an <b>Internet</b> <b>Protocol</b> structure; the transmission net, which connects the core net, the radio net and other connection points with high-capacity lines; and the radio net, which consists of base stations with antennas in masts, on buildings and in some tunnels. The network is controlled by Motorola. In case a base station no longer can communicate with the core net, the base station can still relay communication within its range. Should the base station fall out or operations occur in areas without coverage, the terminals can communicate directly with each other.|$|E
5|$|By early April 1999, TouchWave had {{upgraded}} their WebSwitch 1608 {{local area}} network distributed phone system to a product called WebSwitch 2000. On April 13, 1999, Swedish telecommunication company Ericsson announced that it had purchased TouchWave for $46 million. In exchange for the $46M, TouchWave provided Ericsson with <b>Internet</b> <b>Protocol</b> centric network products such as business phone and private business exchanges. The acquisition of TouchWave {{came at a time}} when multibillion-dollar companies were acquiring other relatively small Internet-connected companies, such as WebLine, Selsius, GeoTel, NBX, Dialogic, and Summa Four. Some employees from TouchWave eventually followed serial entrepreneur and former TouchWave president and CEO Samir Lehaff to Adomo, Inc., a provider of voicemail majordomo services. TouchWave co-founder Jeff Snider would go on to be vice president of enterprise sales at Ericsson and then a CEO co-founder of Adomo in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Voice over <b>Internet</b> <b>Protocol</b> (VoIP) allows data packets to be {{used for}} {{synchronous}} voice communications. The data packets are marked as voice type packets and can be prioritized by the network administrators so that the real-time, synchronous conversation is less subject to contention with other types of data traffic which can be delayed (i.e. file transfer or email) or buffered in advance (i.e. audio and video) without detriment. That prioritization is fine when the network has sufficient capacity for all the VoIP calls taking {{place at the same time}} and the network is enabled for prioritization i.e. a private corporate style network, but the Internet is not generally managed in this way and so there can be a big difference in the quality of VoIP calls over a private network and over the public Internet.|$|E

25|$|OSPF is an {{interior}} gateway protocol (IGP) for routing <b>Internet</b> <b>Protocol</b> (IP) packets solely within a single routing domain, such as an autonomous system. It gathers link state information from available routers and constructs a topology map of the network.

OSPF supports <b>Internet</b> <b>Protocol</b> Version 4 (IPv4) and <b>Internet</b> <b>Protocol</b> Version 6 (IPv6) networks and supports the Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) addressing model.|$|E

It is occasionally known as the Department of Defense (DoD) model, because the development of the networking method was funded by the United States Department of Defense through DARPA.|$|E

25|$|The {{internet}} layer {{provides an}} unreliable datagram transmission facility between hosts located on potentially different IP networks by forwarding the transport layer datagrams to an appropriate next-hop router for further relaying to its destination. With this functionality, the internet layer makes possible internetworking, the interworking of different IP networks, and it essentially establishes the Internet. The <b>Internet</b> <b>Protocol</b> {{is the principal}} component of the internet layer, and it defines two addressing systems to identify network hosts' computers, and to locate them on the network. The original address system of the ARPANET and its successor, the Internet, is <b>Internet</b> <b>Protocol</b> version 4 (IPv4). It uses a 32-bit IP address and is therefore capable of identifying approximately four billion hosts. This limitation was eliminated in 1998 by the standardization of <b>Internet</b> <b>Protocol</b> version 6 (IPv6) which uses 128-bit addresses. IPv6 production implementations emerged in approximately 2006.|$|E

The direction of development of remote <b>Internet</b> voting <b>protocol</b> is that implementation of receipt-freeness and coercion-resistance is from with strong physical assumptions to with weak physical assumptions.

In this paper firstly, a receipt-free coercion-resistant remote <b>Internet</b> voting <b>protocol</b> based on M W deniable encryption scheme and BCP commitment scheme is developed. To our best knowledge the proposed remote <b>Internet</b> voting <b>protocol,</b> which has receipt-freeness and coercion-resistance, is the first remote <b>Internet</b> voting <b>protocol</b> implemented without physical assumptions. Secondly, we analyze receipt-freeness and coercion-resistance of the proposed remote <b>Internet</b> voting <b>protocol.</b> Finally, we compare security properties of several typical protocols with our present protocol. </span...|$|R
