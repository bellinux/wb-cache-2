The Duxford Air Show usually exhibits {{a wide range of}} aircraft, <b>from</b> <b>vintage</b> warbirds to contemporary jet aircraft, along with aerobatic flying by groups such as the Red Arrows. while the Flying Legends show focuses on historic aircraft, especially those of the Second World War. In 2008 it was reported that these displays generate up to £1.8 million, while the loss of up to £100,000 due to adverse weather is also budgeted for. The policing bill, necessary to manage the resulting road traffic, was reported as some £8,000. Recent major events have included the Battle of Britain 70th Anniversary airshow, held on 4–5 September 2010. The show was attended by more than 40,000 people, and featured formation displays by four Hawker Hurricanes and sixteen Spitfires.|$|E

500|$|To {{create a}} {{commercial}} for Mya, Motorola hired the McCann Erickson company, who in turn hired Digital Domain to create the character. The design {{was described as a}} [...] "big-budget" [...] production, though Digital Domain were only given three months to complete the project. Mya's physical representation: a tall, thin, blonde, blue-eyed white female, was created in the likeness of a human model, Michelle Holgate. The initial inspiration for Mya came <b>from</b> <b>vintage</b> pin-up girls. The first representation of Mya had a very small waist and large breasts, and was said to resemble Jessica Rabbit, which did not impress either Motorola or McCann Erickson. Motorola asked Digital Domain to make Mya look as human as possible yet still be obviously artificial. The first completed iteration of Mya was so realistic that Motorola asked for her to be made more obviously digital. Viewers were reportedly not impressed with Mya because they thought she was a real person. Digital Domain visual effects supervisor and animation director, Fred Raimondi, decided to remodel Mya's appearance to be [...] "just to the left of real". [...] Mya's hair was changed from brunette to bleach blonde. Her short spiky hair style was said to resemble that of Serena Altschul. According to Digital Domain, giving Mya hair that was longer than ear-length was not possible in the time they had been given, due to the difficulties of creating digital photorealistic hair. Mya's final body shape was an almost exact copy of the original model's measurements. Mya was typically seen wearing a silver pantsuit but also appeared in halter tops in some shots and dressed in an evening gown for her debut. While Digital Domain staff wanted Mya to appear in a knee-length skirt with high boots, Motorola and McCann chose the pantsuit, due to its contemporary look.|$|E

2500|$|The {{practice}} of irrigation {{has its share}} of criticism and environmental concerns. In many European wine regions the practice is banned under the belief that irrigation can be detrimental to quality wine production. However, in the early 21st century some European countries have relaxed their irrigation laws or reevaluated the issue. Of the criticisms leveled towards irrigation, the most common is that it disrupts the natural expression of terroir in the land as well as the unique characteristics that comes with vintage variation. In regions that do not practice irrigation, the quality and styles of wines can be dramatically different <b>from</b> <b>vintage</b> to vintage depending on weather conditions and rainfall. Irrigation's contribution to the broader globalization of wine is criticized as promoting a homogenization or [...] "standardization" [...] of wine.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2000s, several {{equipment}} manufacturers such as Boss and Akai produced bass synthesizer effect pedals for electric bass guitar players, which simulate {{the sound of}} an analog or digital bass synth. [...] With these devices, a bass guitar is used to generate synth bass sounds. [...] The BOSS SYB-3 was one of the early bass synthesizer pedals. [...] The SYB-3 reproduces sounds of analog synthesizers with Digital Signal Processing saw, square, and pulse synth waves and user-adjustable filter cutoff. [...] The Akai bass synth pedal contains a four-oscillator synthesizer with user selectable parameters (attack, decay, envelope depth, dynamics, cutoff, resonance). [...] Bass synthesizer software allows performers to use MIDI to integrate the bass sounds with other synthesizers or drum machines. [...] Bass synthesizers often provide samples <b>from</b> <b>vintage</b> 1970s and 1980s bass synths. [...] Some bass synths are built into an organ style pedalboard or button board.|$|E
2500|$|Sauternes is a French sweet {{wine from}} the Sauternais {{region of the}} Graves section in [...] Bordeaux. Sauternes is made from Sémillon, Sauvignon blanc, and Muscadelle grapes that have been {{affected}} by Botrytis cinerea, also known as noble rot. This causes the grapes to become partially raisined, resulting in concentrated and distinctively flavored wines. Due to its climate, Sauternes {{is one of the few}} wine regions where infection with noble rot is a frequent occurrence. Even so, production is a hit-or-miss proposition, with widely varying harvests <b>from</b> <b>vintage</b> to vintage. Wines from Sauternes, especially the Premier Cru Supérieur estate Château d'Yquem, can be very expensive, due largely to the very high cost of production. Barsac lies within Sauternes, and is entitled to use either name. Somewhat similar but less expensive and typically less-distinguished wines are produced in the neighboring regions of Monbazillac, Cérons, Loupiac and Cadillac. In the United States, there is a semi-generic label for sweet white dessert wines known as sauterne without the [...] "s" [...] at the end and uncapitalized.|$|E
50|$|Crusted port {{is usually}} a blend of port wine <b>from</b> several <b>vintages,</b> {{although}} single vintage crusted ports have sometimes {{been made in the}} past.

25|$|Another well-publicized {{example of}} label fraud {{is the case}} of Rudy Kurniawan; he was arrested on March 8, 2012 and indicted for fraud.

He famously consigned several lots of Clos St. Denis from Domaine Ponsot <b>from</b> <b>vintages</b> long prior to any recorded production of Ponsot wines from that vineyard; the auction lots were withdrawn prior to bidding.|$|R
2500|$|The Lisbon tramway {{network has}} been {{managed by the}} Companhia Carris de Ferro de Lisboa (Carris) ("Lisbon Iron Rails Company") for over a century. The current fleet (since 1995) {{includes}} authentic vintage cars (700s), units made <b>from</b> <b>vintage</b> bodies powered by modern engines (541-585 and 4-11), and fully modern, articulated trams (501-510). In Porto a tram network has been in operation since 12 September 1895, making it the first electric tramway in the Iberian Peninsula. [...] Most routes were closed in the 1970s and 1980s, but one survived and some closed sections have reopened in the 2000s, so that currently four routes (1, 18, 22 and T) are in operation. [...] A heritage tram line operates seasonally in Sintra. Repeated reductions of service and extension started in 1954, until it finally closed in 1975. It was re-opened in 1980 using {{a section of the}} former line and surviving trams; it has since recovered most of its original extension. Almada has a light rail network, which opened in 2007 after two decades of planning and postponing, the Metro Sul do Tejo; its expansion to Seixal and Barreiro is likewise planned.|$|E

Every album I'm just gonna try to give you more of me, and what I think about certain things... This album is just gonna be the first album on some out of this world crack, basically". In an interview for The Village Voice, he discussed his use of melody, repetition, and hooks, relating it to child discipline, saying that [...] "Americans are not the biggest listeners. I didn't listen, which is why my granddaddy beat me half the time. It's only when the belt is swinging at you in the same repetitive manner that you actually start to listen. So it's all about creating a belt on the song that repetitiously swings at you. It doesn't mean that in between the belt swinging, I'm not saying stuff that means something".|$|E
