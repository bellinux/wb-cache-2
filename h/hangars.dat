5|$|All {{housing and}} major <b>hangars</b> were {{completed}} in 1918, including a large steel-and-wood hangar, two concrete <b>hangars</b> for seaplanes and flying boats, a supply warehouse, a machine shop, a photography laboratory and a powerhouse. In 1919, {{the field was}} named Luke Field after Frank Luke, a World War I ace and Medal of Honor recipient. The U.S. Army's introduction of aviation to Ford Island triggered expansion throughout Hawaii {{with the development of}} civilian airports, the creation of the Hawaii chapter of the National Aeronautic Association, and a national flying code. The army's aviation division was generally favorably received by the Hawaiians, who took the military's investment in their land as a compliment.|$|E

50|$|The oldest {{original}} Baer Army Air Field <b>hangar,</b> <b>Hangar</b> No. 40, was in {{use from}} World War II until 2012. <b>Hangar</b> No. 40's final tenant was FedEx Express, who used {{it until the}} <b>hangar</b> was damaged in a weather-related incident. After the damage to <b>Hangar</b> No. 40, FedEx moved into {{a portion of the}} former Kitty Hawk hub. <b>Hangar</b> No. 40 was demolished between March and April 2013.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{destruction}} of <b>Hangar</b> 1 by fire in 1987, Brooklands purchased <b>Hangar</b> 3 (the easternmost <b>hangar).</b> In 1989 the airfield lease and <b>Hangar</b> 3 was purchased by Blanefield Investments (not Blanefield Property Company Ltd) and Brooklands continued aircraft manufacture in <b>Hangar</b> 2 {{for a short period}} before moving manufacture to Hurn airport (now Bournemouth Airport).|$|R
5|$|The airport opened July 8, 1929, {{on a site}} {{selected}} by Charles Lindbergh, as the eastern air terminus of the Transcontinental Air Transport air-rail New York to Los Angeles transcontinental route. Passengers traveled overnight on the Pennsylvania Railroad's Airway Limited from New York to Columbus; by air from Columbus to Waynoka, Oklahoma; by rail again on the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe from Waynoka to Clovis, New Mexico; and by air from Clovis to Los Angeles. The original terminal building and <b>hangars</b> are still in use; the <b>hangars</b> are still in use, but the old terminal sits derelict.|$|E
5|$|This CATOBAR {{arrangement}} {{allows for}} faster launching and recovery {{as well as}} a much wider range of aircraft that can be used on board compared with smaller aircraft carriers, most of which use a simpler STOVL arrangement without catapults or arrestor wires. The ship's aircraft operations are controlled by the air boss from Primary Flight Control or Pri-Fly. Four large elevators transport aircraft between the flight deck and the <b>hangars</b> below. These <b>hangars</b> are divided into three bays by thick steel doors that are designed to restrict the spread of fire.|$|E
5|$|All {{terminals}} and <b>hangars</b> were on {{the square}} periphery. By the late 1970s, the shorter north–south and east–west runway pairs had been closed, though some were converted to taxiways. The other four runways remain in use, all strengthened and enhanced, but about the same lengths as always. A short runway (13R/31L) for light aircraft was added in 1989.|$|E
50|$|A second <b>hangar</b> with {{roughly the}} same {{dimensions}} as <b>Hangar</b> I was erected in right angle behind the control tower. On two sides the building is surrounded by classrooms that were used for training of flying staff and maintenance personnel. The <b>hangar</b> still features the original <b>hangar</b> doors.|$|R

5|$|At Gosport, five {{aircraft}} {{were lost}} and five damaged. Several buildings were wrecked and two <b>hangars</b> damaged. But {{there were no}} casualties. The Ju 87 attack had been accurate, and no bombs fell outside the military compounds. In the Gosport area, 10 barrage balloons were shot down and two damaged.|$|E
5|$|Belfasts {{aviation}} capability {{was provided}} by two catapult-launched Supermarine Walrus amphibious biplanes. These could be launched from a D1H catapult mounted aft of the forward superstructure, and recovered from the water by two cranes mounted {{on either side of}} the forward funnel. The aircraft, operated by the Fleet Air Arm's HMS Belfast Flight of 700 Naval Air Squadron, were stowed in two <b>hangars</b> in the forward superstructure.|$|E
5|$|For their efforts, 9 Staffel {{destroyed}} {{at least}} three <b>hangars,</b> hit several other buildings and destroyed eight Hurricanes on the ground. According to other sources, 10 <b>hangars</b> were destroyed, six damaged, the operations room put out of action, and many buildings were destroyed. It would have been worse had the bombs been released higher. A lot of bombs landed horizontally and did not explode on impact. To achieve this level of damage, KG 76 dropped nine tons of bombs. At {{the end of the}} day just one hangar was left operational at Kenley. The low-level raid put the airfield out of commission for two hours. In combat, two Hurricanes were shot down by the Dorniers' return fire. In return 9 Staffel lost four Do 17s, three slightly damaged and two seriously damaged. Low-level attacks were abandoned after The Hardest Day.|$|E
50|$|The 1938 {{construction}} {{included two}} paved runways (a main runway at 6,175 {{feet in length}} and East-West at 2,300 feet in length), a boiler plant, headquarters building, metal balloon <b>hangar,</b> six-plane <b>hangar,</b> corrugated-iron <b>hangar,</b> storehouse, flight-surgeon office, and film-storage building. The metal balloon <b>hangar</b> had served at Fort Casey, Washington, since May 1921. Workers disassembled the <b>hangar,</b> placed it on a truck, and drove to Fort Lewis where the same workers reassembled the structure.|$|R
50|$|New hangar: In {{the fall}} of 1952, the airport's <b>hangar</b> burned down. A new <b>hangar</b> was {{dedicated}} in 1963. It was constructed by Harold J. Coles utilizing prefabricated trusses that were trucked in. In the early 1970s, Wylie Jr. built a modern maintenance <b>hangar</b> and additional <b>hangar</b> space for 30 resident planes.|$|R

5|$|Hampshire County Council leased {{the site}} from the Crown Estates in 1964; the castle itself {{passed into the}} {{guardianship}} of the state, and the <b>hangars</b> were used as an activity centre. A Royal National Lifeboat Institution station opened in 1971 alongside the castle, with a -tall replacement coastguard tower constructed two years later.|$|E
5|$|In December 1945, Hōshōs {{overhanging}} {{flight deck}} at the bow {{was cut off}} and her <b>hangars</b> were modified to carry more passengers. Thereafter, she undertook more repatriation missions beginning with one to Wewak on 5 January 1946 and subsequent trips to China. In total, the carrier made nine repatriation trips before 15 August 1946 and transported about 40,000 passengers.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the wing}} {{had the option of}} moving with the F-15s to Barnes, but most decided to stay behind and train for new missions. The crash trucks went to Barnes, leaving the brush {{breakers}} of the Massachusetts Military Reservation behind. The buildings formerly occupied by the fighter wing, including the <b>hangars,</b> will be occupied by the intelligence mission.|$|E

5|$|Most of the German bombers {{had passed}} over {{and had an}} {{altitude}} advantage over French fighters trying to gain height to intercept. Skirmishes were few and far between, but some French units suffered heavy losses. For the attack, the Germans had used the new C-250 Flammbombe (Flame Bomb) which had only been cleared for use 24 hours earlier. The incendiary bomb did some damage to <b>hangars</b> and parked aircraft.|$|E
5|$|On November13, a level three TCOR {{was issued}} for Okinawa. This {{prompted}} military personnel to begin securing {{the island and}} preparing planes without <b>hangars</b> for evacuation. Brushing {{the region as a}} Category3-equivalent typhoon, Karen caused considerable disruptions to airlines, trains, shipping, and communications. No serious damage was reported in Okinawa, but the nearby Daiyumaru and another Japanese fishing vessel with a total of 26crew went missing.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 6 April, German {{aircraft}} conducted surprise attacks on Yugoslav airfields in the 7th Army area, including Ljubljana and Cerklje, where the 6th Air Reconnaissance Group was based. At 07:00, Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighters of Jagdgeschwader 27 strafed Ljubljana airfield, attacking <b>hangars</b> and some Potez 25 biplanes.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} {{structures}} was the Arch Hangar. At the time, {{it was the largest}} monolithic arch roof structure in the US, and one of the largest <b>hangars</b> in the world. The construction of the hangar was also groundbreaking, including a foundation set on bedrock, extensive footing structures, intricate formwork, and a 340-foot arch span.|$|E
5|$|The American {{carriers}} {{launched an}} airstrike shortly after dawn; Zuikaku {{was struck by}} three bombs and one torpedo that started fires in both <b>hangars,</b> damaged one propeller shaft, {{and gave her a}} 29.5° list to port. Fifteen minutes later, the fires were extinguished and the list was reduced to 6° by counterflooding. She was mostly ignored by the second wave of attacking aircraft, but was a focus of the third wave that hit her with six more torpedoes and four bombs. The bombs started fires in the <b>hangars,</b> the torpedoes caused major flooding that increased her list, and the order to abandon ship was issued before Zuikaku sank by the stern. Lost with the ship were 49 officers and 794 crewmen, but 47 officers and 815 crewmen were rescued by her escorting destroyers.|$|E
5|$|The Sovetsky Soyuz-class {{ships were}} {{provided}} with aircraft facilities to handle two to four KOR-2 flying boats which would be launched by the two catapults mounted on the stern.
