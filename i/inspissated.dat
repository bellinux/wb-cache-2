They are brought in large baskets, and purchased at the commencement of the season. The liquor with which the pancakes are agglutinated together by the ball-maker, and worked into the ball, is merely <b>inspissated</b> opium-water, the opium for which is derived from the condemned opium, (Passewa,) the washing of the utensils, and of the workmen, every one of whom is nightly laved before he leaves the establishment, and the water is <b>inspissated.</b> Thus not a particle of opium is lost. To encourage the farmers, the refuse stalks, leaves, and heads are bought up, to pack the balls with; but this is far from an economical plan, for it is difficult to keep the refuse from damp and insects.|$|E

5000|$|The tree has {{a rounded}} crown and smooth grey bark flaking to reveal yellowish-orange patches. As with most {{species in the}} family the twigs and {{branches}} display prominent lenticels. Leaves are soft and drooping, with petioles equal to the leaves in length, and visibly thicker or <b>inspissate</b> at their extremities. Leaves are alternate and broadly elliptic to ovate, with rounded or notched apex and a terminal bristle (mucronate). Leaf surfaces are often noticeably scratched by their rubbing against the bristles of surrounding leaves. The species is variable as regards pubescence, ranging from entirely glabrous to pubescent on stems and leaves. The fragrant, pincushion-like flowers are without petals and are produced in abundance {{at the beginning of}} the rainy season. Filaments are numerous (c.50) and long, initially pale yellow then turning darker with age. The 4 calyx segments recurve on opening, and the base is fringed with hairs. The distinctive torulose fruit is a silique and resembles a string of beads some 150mm in length. A slender, taller version of this species growing in the Socotra archipelago, Somalia, Ethiopia and Yemen has been named Maerua angolensis subsp. socotrana (Schweinf. ex Balf. f.) Kers. M. angolensis is similar to M. schinzii Pax. from Namibia, which has thicker, almost fleshy leaves and other relatively trivial differences. The wood of this species is whitish-yellow, hard, dense and fine-grained, with a tendency to separate into concentric shells along the annual rings.|$|R

"In February 1853, Dr. Arnott had {{forwarded}} {{to him a}} watery extract prepared from the root of a tree, described as 'Wabie,' a toxicodendron from the Somali country on the Habr Gerhajis range of the Goolies mountains. The tree grows to the height of twenty feet. The poison is obtained by boiling the root in water, until it attains the consistency of an <b>inspissated</b> juice. When cool the barb of the arrow is anointed with the juice, which, {{is regarded as a}} virulent poison, and it renders a wound tainted therewith incurable. Dr. Arnott was informed that death usually took place within an hour; that the hairs and nails dropped off after death, and it was believed that the application of heat assisted its poisonous qualities. He could not, however ascertain the quantity made use of by the Somalis, and doubted if the point of an arrow would convey a sufficient quantity to produce such immediate effects. He had tested its powers in some other experiments, besides the ones detailed, and although it failed in several instances, yet he was led to the conclusion that it was a very powerful narcotic irritant poison. He had not, however, observed the local effect said to be produced upon the point of insertion." ...|$|E
60|$|At Oxford, however, rather {{different}} sentiments prevailed. The inherent effervescence of conglomerate youth had, {{during the two}} months of the term before Black Week, been gradually crystallising out into vivid oppositions. Normal adolescence, ever in England of a conservative tendency though not taking things too seriously, was vehement for a fight to a finish and a good licking for the Boers. Of this larger faction Val Dartie was naturally a member. Radical youth, on the other hand, a small but perhaps more vocal body, was for stopping the war and giving the Boers autonomy. Until Black Week, however, the groups were amorphous, without sharp edges, and argument remained but academic. Jolly {{was one of those}} who knew not where he stood. A streak of his grandfather old Jolyon's love of justice prevented, him from seeing one side only. Moreover, in his set of 'the best' there was a 'jumping-Jesus' of extremely advanced opinions and some personal magnetism. Jolly wavered. His father, too, seemed doubtful in his views. And though, as was proper at the age of twenty, he kept a sharp eye on his father, watchful for defects which might still be remedied, still that father had an 'air' which gave a sort of glamour to his creed of ironic tolerance. Artists of course; were notoriously Hamlet-like, and to this extent one must discount for one's father, even if one loved him. But Jolyon's original view, that to 'put your nose in where you aren't wanted' (as the Uitlanders had done) 'and then work the oracle till you get on top is not being quite the clean potato,' had, whether founded in fact or no, a certain attraction for his son, who thought a deal about gentility. On the other hand Jolly could not abide such as his set called 'cranks,' and Val's set called 'smugs,' so that he was still balancing when the clock of Black Week struck. One--two--three, came those ominous repulses at Stormberg, Magersfontein, Colenso. The sturdy English soul reacting after the first cried, 'Ah! but Methuen!' after the second: 'Ah! but Buller!' then, in <b>inspissated</b> gloom, hardened. And Jolly said to himself: 'No, damn it! We've got to lick the beggars now; I don't care whether we're right or wrong.' And, if he had known it, his father was thinking the same thought.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Distal {{intestinal}} obstruction syndrome (DIOS) or “meconium ileus equivalent” is a blockage {{of the terminal}} ileum or of the ascending colon caused by <b>inspissated</b> stools in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) beyond the neonatal period. We report {{the case of a}} girl who presented with DIOS as an unusual manifestation which lead to the diagnosis of CF. Case presentation: A 7 year-old female presented with bowel ob- struction that required an exploratory laparotomy. Abundant inspis- sated stools were found obstructing the distal ileum. An enterotomy with extraction of the <b>inspissated</b> material was performed. A few days later the patient presented once more with acute abdomen requiring a second exploratory laparotomy. Dehiscence of the intestinal suture line was found and an ileostomy with mucous fistula was carried out. The histopathologic study showed findings compatible with CF and the sweat chloride test confirmed the diagnosis. Discussion: DIOS as the first manifestation of CF is very unusual. It is important to know this entity and to have a high index of suspicion to diagnose CF when it is found. If DIOS is suspected, conservative treatment should be tried before subjecting the patient to surgery...|$|E
