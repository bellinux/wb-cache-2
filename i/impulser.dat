In the paper, a {{high speed}} {{magneto-optic}} switch {{based on the}} Faraday Effect is designed and analyzed. The optic switch adopts Faraday rotator, nanosecond <b>impulser,</b> and high speed magnetic field, so it is characterized by no moving parts, low transmission loss and polarization insensitive, low optical insertion loss etc. Using the polarization and Faraday Effect of magneto-optic crystal, the magneto-optic switch can hold the function of all-optical switching, which is needed in all-optical communication networks. As {{the first part of}} this paper, a design scheme of optical route in high speed magneto-optic switch and its experiment analysis will be discussed. Good avalanche effect of transistor 2 N 5551 is adopted to generate nanosecond pulse signal and then to drive the high speed magnetic field. Shown by the experiment data, the rising time of the impulse about 10 ns, the amplitude of the impulse about 10 similar to 60 V are available on the Output end from the nanosecond <b>impulser,</b> which can be used as driving current pulse of Faraday rotator. By using the relationship between the polarization plane rotate direction of polarization light and magnetic direction, the Faraday rotator is designed.

All-fiber {{magneto-optic}} switch {{is presented}} in this paper which contains both of optical route and high-speed magnetic field module. The optical route has a 1 x 2 Fiber Polarization Beam Splitter (FPBS) and a 2 x 2 Dual Fiber Polarization Beam Splitter (DFPBS). The high-speed magnetic field module is core of all-fiber magneto-optic switch which changes the electronic pulse into magnetic pulse to control the light polarization's plane based on Faraday Effect. The high-speed magnetic field module adopts Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) crystal fiber, nanosecond <b>impulser</b> and high-speed magnetic field, characterized by no moving parts, low transmission loss and polarization insensitive, low optical insertion loss etc. YIG crystal fiber, the magneto-optic material with high Verdet constant, used to rotate the polarization plane of the polarized light 90 degrees in all-fiber magneto-optic switch, is grown by Laser Heated Pedestal Growth (LHPG). CMOS chip FMMT 415 which has good avalanche effect is employed to generate the nanosecond pulse. The pulse we measured is about 10 ns of the rising time and 0 similar to 600 V of the amplitude and the output current is used to create the magnetic field.

40|$|The aim of {{the essay}} is to {{investigate}} how the historical societal context is presented in curricula and textbooks. The studied material consists of the curricula Lpf 94 and Gy 11, and four textbooks on literature intended for teaching the subject of Swedish in upper secondary school. The literary eras that are studied are the Enlightenment and the Romantic period. The study of the textbooks proceeds from the analytical schema of the historian Niklas Ammert. Theories of literary and social conceptual worlds are applied to analyse the textbooks and a curriculum-theory perspective is used to analyse the steering documents.     The analysis shows {{that there is a}} greater focus on the relationship between literature and societal development in Gy 11 and that there are stricter learning requirements. One difference between the textbooks is the approach they have chosen to get at the historical societal context. Den levande litteraturen and Texter och tankar från antiken till 1900 do this chiefly through a type of presentation that uses explanations and sometimes simple statements of fact.

An all-fiber {{magneto-optic}} switch {{is designed}} in this paper, which {{makes use of}} Faraday Effect, fiber-type polarizing beam splitter/combiner (PBS/PBC), magneto-optic crystal fiber, nanosecond <b>impulser</b> and high-speed magnetic field control technology. The design scheme uses magneto-optic crystal fiber instead of bulky magneto-optic crystal. The optical route design includes linear layout of magneto-optic crystal fiber, the optical route design of polarized light in fiber PBS/PBC, magnetic route design and analysis of linear solenoid, etc. A solenoid which is driven by nanosecond current and can generate high-speed magnetic field is designed and manufactured. The result analysis shows that pulse signal can be greatly strengthened by impressed-bias static magnetic field which is perpendicular to transmission direction of light beam. Static magnetic field insures the intensity of induced magnetization where the light passes come back to original value, {{so that it can}} offer high-extent magnetization equality. The intensity of magnetic field can be improved to two orders when the length ratio of magneto-optic crystal fiber to solenoid is increased eight times. When the diameter of magneto-optic crystal and solenoid is decreased from three millimeters to one millimeter, the intensity of magnetic field can be improved to one order. The all fiber magneto-optic switch is slim in structure, flexible, easy to high-density integration and expansion, so there are many integration methods to design all-fiber magneto-optic switch array, which is characterized of smaller bulk, higher magnetic field usage, lower consumption and driving voltage, etc...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} on human judgment {{and decision making}} has demonstrated systematic and predictable biases of judgment in experimental settings. One {{example of this is}} the tendency to intuitively violate the conjunction rule - a simple rule of probability. This was well illustrated in the famous Linda-problem. (Tversky & Kahneman, 1983). According to the dual-process theory of reasoning, (Kahneman, 2011) reasoning fallacies such as the conjunction fallacy occurs when people fail to use analytic reasoning and instead overly rely on their intuition. The dual process theory proposes that cognitive processes underlying our intuitive impulses and our conscious reasoning constitutes two different modes in the mind –system 1 and system 2 - and that the intuitive system 1 are not able to compute probabilities. Furthermore, it is assumed that processes that are labeled system 1 are fast whereas system 2 are thought to be slow. We tested these time course assumptions of dual process theory in a within-subject design by comparing response time latencies between conjunction fallacy judgments and accurate probability judgments. The results showed that inducing accurate responding did not result in delayed response latency. This indicates that making accurate probability judgments does not require more processing time which goes against what would be expected by the dual-process framework. Tidigare forskning om mänskligt beslutsfattande och bedömningar har i experiment påvisat systematiska och förutsägbara bias. Ett exempel på detta är tendensen att intuitivt gå emot konjuktionsregeln- en enkel regel gällande sannolikhet. Detta illustrerades väl i det berömda Linda- problemet (Tversky & Kahneman, 1983). Enligt två-systemsteorin (Kahneman, 2011) om problemlösning, uppstår bedömningsfel såsom konjuktionsfelet när människor inte använder sig av analytiskt tänkande och istället förlitar sig för mycket på sin intuition. Två-systemsteorin menar att de kognitiva processer som ligger till grund för våra intuitiva <b>impulser</b> och vårt medvetna resonerande utgör två olika aktörer i vårt tänkande- system 1 och system 2 - och att det intuitiva system 1 inte kan beräkna sannolikheter.

40|$|The master thesis «Improability» {{intends to}} gather an {{understanding}} of how the teacher makes use of pedagogical improvisation in their instructing. A phenomenon that involves tacit knowledge and mediated actions that already {{is a part of the}} knowledge and experience of the research participants. The target group for this thesis is art educators and teachers within all areas of formation where teaching can open for the possibility of building bridges between two different but still combinable arenas and as an educational tool. A teaching method that can increase the interest and knowledge of the phenomenon of pedagogical improvisation. The study is qualitative and divided into three different methodical phases for the different parts of the process. The methodological approach is characterised by a triadic structure to generate empirical data. In the analysis, the study has used a hermeneutics phenomenology approach. A narrative approach and analyse of history to present and to discuss the findings in light of relevant theory. Analyses of stories told by three of the research participants has contributed to articulate their stories and tied them to their notion of meaning. I have made use of established theory from the field of theatre based on exercises and techniques from the subject of improvisation, the educators professional qualifications and the teacher`s bodily cognition. The problem as presented in this thesis is: How does the teacher recognise the moment that depends on whether she is able to use her preparedness and to move into a pedagogical improvisation and carry out her Improability? My findings are presented and discussed on the basis of two scientific questions. They treat the teacher`s bodily cognition and the exact moment the educator is dependent of recognizing. The other is what preparedness the educator uses to commit a pedagogical improvisation. Through the presentation of finds and discussion, I show through my study that pedagogical improvisation, can be understood as a mediated action. Through experimenting, the teacher explores on the edge and acquire knowledge. She has the potential to reformulate and adapt to fit new contexts. Education is a physical practice, something that leads to what the educator hears, sees and gathers impressions by using all her senses to recognise spontaneous impulses and impressions. Something I show as crucial to act “in action”. With the help of the teacher`s bodily cognition the educator sees that she needs to use her preparedness in order to use pedagogical improvisation. The preparedness is different techniques and exercises that are experienced and perceived, and that through experimenting and practice becomes a mediated action. Improability is the ability to act, through the help of the teacher`s bodily cognition and VIII pedagogical improvisation, that opens to new opportunities as the educator walks on the edge, into an unknown territory. Masteroppgaven «Improability» har til hensikt å vise en forståelse for hvordan underviseren benytter seg av pedagogisk improvisasjon i undervisning. Et fenomen som innebærer taus kunnskap og medierte handlinger som ligger i forskningsdeltakerne sine erfaringer og opplevelser. Målgruppe for oppgaven er kunstfagspedagoger og pedagoger i alle danningsarenaer, der en formidling, kan åpne opp for en brobygging mellom to ulike men kombinerbare arenaer og fungere som et pedagogisk verktøy. En formidling som kan gi økt interesse og kunnskap om fenomenet pedagogisk improvisasjon. Studien er kvalitativ og inndelt i tre ulike metodiske faser for de ulike delene av prosessen. Metodetriangulering for generering av empiri. En hermeneutisk fenomenologisk tilnærming i analyseprosessen. En narrativ tilnærming og analyse av historie for å presentere og drøfte funn i møte med relevant teori. Analyser av historier fra mine tre forskningsdeltakere har bidratt til å artikulere deres historier som funn og knyttet til begreper. Jeg har benyttet etablert teori fra teaterfeltet basert på øvelser og teknikker fra improvisasjonsfaget, lærerens profesjonsferdighet og lærerkropp. Problemformulering for oppgaven er: Hvordan gjenkjenner underviseren det øyeblikket som avgjør om hun klarer å benytte sin beredskap for å begå pedagogisk improvisasjon og utøve sin Improability? Mine funn blir presentert og drøftet ved hjelp av to forskningsspørsmål. Gjennom presentasjon av funn og drøfting viser jeg at min studie om pedagogisk improvisasjon kan forstås som en mediert handling. Gjennom å eksperimentere og utforske i undervisningen, trår underviseren inn i grenseland og tilegner seg erfaringer som hun omformer og tilpasser i nye kontekster. Undervisning er en kroppslig praksis, noe som fører til at underviseren lytter, ser og sanser med kroppen for å gjenkjenne spontane <b>impulser</b> og inntrykk. Noe jeg viser som avgjørende for å agere «in action». Ved hjelp av lærerkropp ser underviseren at hun må benytte seg av sin beredskap for å begå pedagogisk improvisasjon. Beredskap er ulike teknikker og øvelser som er erfaringsbaserte og opplevde, som gjennom eksperimentering og praksis blir en mediert handling. Improability er evnen til å handle, ved hjelp av lærerkropp og pedagogisk improvisasjon, som åpner opp for muligheter, der underviseren trer inn i grenseland...|$|E

40|$|Initiation {{of cardiac}} arrhythmias {{typically}} follows {{one or more}} premature <b>impulses</b> either occurring spontaneously or applied externally. In this study, we characterize the dynamics of propagation of single (S 2) and double premature <b>impulses</b> (S 3), and the mechanisms of block of premature <b>impulses</b> at structural heterogeneities caused by remodeling of gap junctional conductance (Gj) in infarcted myocardium. Using a sub-cellular computer model of infarcted tissue, we found that |INa,max|, prematurity (coupling interval with the previous <b>impulse),</b> and conduction velocity (CV) of premature <b>impulses</b> change dynamically as they propagate away {{from the site of}} initiation. There are fundamental differences between the dynamics of propagation of S 2 and S 3 premature impulses: for S 2 <b>impulses</b> |INa,max| recovers fast, prematurity decreases and CV increases as propagation proceeds; for S 3 <b>impulses</b> low values of |INa,max| persist, prematurity could increase, and CV could decrease as <b>impulses</b> propagate away from the site of initiation. As a consequence {{it is more likely that}} S 3 <b>impulses</b> block at sites of structural heterogeneities causing source/sink mismatch than S 2 <b>impulses</b> block. Whether premature <b>impulses</b> block at Gj heterogeneities or not is also determined by the values of Gj (and space constant λ) in regions proximal and distal to the heterogeneity: when λ in the direction of propagation increases > 40 %, premature <b>impulses</b> could block. The maximum slope of CV restitution curves for S 2 <b>impulses</b> is larger than for S 3 <b>impulses.</b> In conclusion: 1) The dynamics of propagation of premature <b>impulses</b> make more likely that S 3 <b>impulses</b> block at sites of structural heterogeneities than S 2 <b>impulses</b> block; 2) Structural heterogeneities causing an increase in λ (or CV) of > 40 % could result in block of premature impulses; 3) A decrease in the maximum slope of CV restitution curves of propagating premature <b>impulses</b> is indicative of an increased potential for block at structural heterogeneitie...|$|R

This paper {{is an attempt to}} understand the consumer <b>impulse</b> buying behavior among the millennials at superstores in Agartala. The impact of various variables like discount offer, various scheme, promotional activities, retail store offer, display of product, behavior of sales person, popularity of product, influence of reference group, income level of customers and festival season, on consumer <b>impulse</b> buying behavior, have been analyzed. The study is based on the primary data collected with the help of structured questionnaire. Data analysis has been done using SPSS software. The statistical analysis method employed in this study is Factor Analysis. The final outcome of the study helps in understanding the factors that affect the <b>impulse</b> purchase or <b>impulse</b> buying behavior of the customers and also the stimuli that triggers <b>impulse</b> buying. Introduction: An <b>impulse</b> purchase or <b>impulse</b> buying is an unplanned or otherwise spontaneous purchase. <b>Impulse</b> items can be anything, a new product, samples or well-established products at surprising low prices. Parboteeah (2005) stated that <b>impulse</b> purchasing is unplanned, the result of an exposure to a stimulus, and is decided on-the-spot. <b>Impulse</b> buyers start browsing without having a purpose to procure a definite article or visiting certain store. As customers browse, they are exposed to the stimuli, which triggers customers’ urge to buy on <b>impulse.</b> When <b>impulse</b> consumers consider the aspiration to purchase, they construct a procure decision with no penetrating for data and information or appraising best possible alternatives. Then, customers may face positive or negative outcomes through the post-purchase assessment after the procure on <b>impulse.</b> In this progression, shoppers are prejudiced by inner and outside things that generate the <b>impulse</b> purchase behavio...|$|R
40|$|This dissertation's {{objectives}} were to validate <b>impulse</b> buying tendency as a genuinely distinctive construct related to <b>impulse</b> purchase behavior {{and attached to}} fundamental personality traits, and its relationships {{to a number of}} relevant factors. Studies reported were steps {{to a better understanding of}} the <b>impulse</b> buying phenomenon. In the first 2 studies (using Dutch and Indonesian samples), a reliable 20 -item scale to measure <b>impulse</b> buying tendency was developed. The scale has 2 facets represented by correlated subscales, referring to the cognitive (i. e., the lack of planning and deliberation) and affective aspects (i. e., feelings of pleasure and excitement, an urge to buy, the difficulty to leave things, and possible regret afterwards). Correlations with self-reported purchase patterns indicated that high <b>impulse</b> buying tendency resulted in more impulsive purchases with higher impulsivity. <b>Impulse</b> buying tendency was also correlated with several personality-based individual differences. The next study observed <b>impulse</b> buying behavior in actual purchase settings. <b>Impulse</b> buying tendency was correlated with the primary dimensions (MDS analysis) of emotions associated with, and buying considerations of the purchase. Findings verified that these dimensions are stable, with high arousal emotions and impetuous buying considerations related to <b>impulse</b> buying consumption experience. In the 2 final studies (using Norwegian and Indonesian samples) <b>impulse</b> buying tendency scale was validated with the Big Five/Five Factor Model personality dimensions (i. e., Extraversion, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, Neuroticism/Emotional Stability, and Openness/Autonomy). Results confirmed that <b>impulse</b> buying tendency is a personality-based trait. Indications of gender differences in <b>impulse</b> buying; older people may demonstrate more control on their <b>impulse</b> buying tendency; presence of others may enhance <b>impulse</b> buying behavior; and favorable normative evaluation mediates between <b>impulse</b> buying tendency and the impulsiveness of buying decision; were the other findings. Altogether, they disclose interesting evidence of the intricate nature of <b>impulse</b> buying, a universal, yet culture-bound, phenomenon...|$|R

50|$|At {{the start}} of each Major Power move, the {{controlling}} player must choose an <b>impulse</b> type. This represents that Major Power's current allocation of resources and planning. The possible choices are: Land <b>impulse,</b> Naval <b>impulse,</b> Air <b>impulse,</b> Combined <b>impulse,</b> and Pass <b>impulse.</b> Choosing a Land <b>impulse</b> will allow the player to move any number of land units, some air units and no naval units. Correspondingly, a Naval <b>impulse</b> will allow the movement of any number of naval units, some air units and no land units. The Air <b>impulse</b> allows the movement of any number of air units, but no other moves. A Combined <b>impulse</b> allows a limited number of land, air and naval movements, and restricts the number of land attacks that can be performed. The exact number of movements allowed depends on the Major Power and reflects its overall size and organization. Larger and more powerful Major Powers like the U.S. have more moves available in each category than, for instance, Italy. The Pass <b>impulse</b> allows no moves or attack. If two or more Major Powers choose this option, the chance for ending the turn increases.|$|R
40|$|<b>Impulse</b> buying is a {{phenomenon}} that has attracted attention from marketers and consumer researchers for decades. Whilst <b>impulse</b> buying has been studied extensively, there is a gap {{in our understanding of}} consumer <b>impulse</b> buying choice in different consumption situations. <b>Impulse</b> buying research lacks a theoretical and systematic approach in examining and integrating situational variables. This thesis aims to examine consumer <b>impulse</b> buying choice in various situations simultaneously through the identification of both external and individual determinants of <b>impulse</b> buying behaviour in each situation. This thesis adopts the view of radical behaviourism and the behaviour perspective model (BPM). Radical behaviourism views <b>impulse</b> buying as a behavioural pattern shaped by its contingencies, and the BPM provides a theoretical model which generates the influences of both external and individual-related factors and investigates the interactions between the determinants of <b>impulse</b> buying from the pre-purchase to the post-purchase stage. The BPM matrix also provides a systematic framework to examine consumer <b>impulse</b> buying choice in various consumption situations. A questionnaire was developed based on the BPM with a pre-study interview used as a complementary method. The survey collected data from 414 consumers in the UK and Taiwan. The results show that <b>impulse</b> buying behaviour is shaped by its contingencies {{and the ways in which}} the BPM components influence <b>impulse</b> buying behaviour vary significantly in different situations. The routine shopping situation and its utilitarian reinforcements trigger the highest rate of <b>impulse</b> buying choice. Secondly, the results demonstrate the interactions between the consumption situations and their corresponding individual-related factors, which illustrate the different types of <b>impulse</b> buying behavioural patterns. Thirdly, post-purchase regret was not necessarily found as the punishment that reduces <b>impulse</b> buying behaviour but an indicator of individuals’ <b>impulse</b> buying patterns. Finally, individuals’ cultural backgrounds were also found to predict different types of <b>impulse</b> buying patterns effectively. As the first study to investigate consumer <b>impulse</b> buying choice in different situations, this study contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence of situational influences and cultural differences. In addition, this study complements existing <b>impulse</b> buying knowledge by adopting a behavioural perspective. This research also offers managerial implications for international marketers and consumer policy makers on the ways in which <b>impulse</b> buying behaviour may be encouraged or controlled. ...|$|R
