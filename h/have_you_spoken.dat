Unbeknownst to everybody I was actually the guy out there. I was in overalls and a hat. You really are not serious with that question." ...|$|E

60|$|Emp. Turn the discourse: I have {{a reason}} why I would not <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> so tenderly. Knew you what shame your kind {{expressions}} bring, You would, in pity, spare a wretched king.|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>spoken</b> to your grandson, old Mr. Scott?" [...] I said. [...] "It is {{but right}} {{that you should}} make {{yourself}} known to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That will I, with joy," [...] {{answered}} the Hebrew with kindling eye; [...] "but your ambition soars high, prince. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>spoken</b> to Branwen on these subjects?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I won't <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> like it, dear Tess!

6000|$|... 'Just a woman's wiles. At {{this moment}} she can't hear us, {{but she knows}} pretty nearly what we are saying by the way our lips are going. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>spoken</b> to her?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well, why not? Elsa {{would have}} been better in some respects, but Hedwig--ah, yes, she, too, is a good girl a little wild perhaps--it will wear off. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>spoken</b> with her?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Unworthy of her, my dear fellow!" [...] exclaimed Charley, {{grasping}} {{his hand}} and wringing it violently; [...] "no doubt you are, and so is everybody, but you shall have her for all that, my boy. But tell me, Harry, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>spoken</b> to Kate herself?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Poor dear,' {{continued}} Albinia, 'what {{a commotion}} {{there will be}} in her head; but she has behaved so well hitherto, that I hope we may steer her safely through, above all, {{if one of the}} six cousins will but catch him in the rebound! <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>spoken</b> to her?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do {{come out}} of it,' she coaxed, with a {{softness}} in her voice which any man but unpractised Swithin would have felt to be exquisite.
