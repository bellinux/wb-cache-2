The infrared jet persists after the <b>flare</b> <b>point</b> region although X-ray emission is absent; it is plausible that here we are seeing the effects of particle acceleration followed by downstream advection with synchrotron losses.

40|$|MasterExtreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL) {{is one of}} {{the leading}} {{candidates}} for the next generation lithography of 32 nm half pitch technology and beyond. But there are still many problems to be solved before its introduction to mass production. One of the critical issues in EUVL is flare ffect, which is related to the unwanted scattering light. It degrades the contrast of aerial images and the control of the critical dimension (CD) across the exposure field. Therefore, it is necessary to predict accurate flare value and compensate it before destored pattern is printed on a wafer. Mathematically, flare is obtained by convolution of the <b>flare</b> <b>point</b> spread function (PSF) with a clear-field mask. Because the region of flare PSF expends several millimeters, trade-off between resolution and computer resources exists when one calculates flare value. To circumvent this problem, we defined a critical region of PSF and found the relationship between accuracy and grid size of PSF. In this paper, we studied on flare PSF and flare value for various patterns and investigated a smart way to obtain an accurate flare map especially at the edge area of pattern where the gradient of flare value is high, using a fractal model of flare PSF for Alpha demo tool (ADT). Moreover we proposed a mask level compensation strategy for flare value correction.

AR activity is modulated by a polymorphic CAG repeat sequence in AR exon 1. This study aimed {{to investigate the}} relationship between serum testosterone levels, CAG repeat numbers and hepatitis B virus (HBV) -related acute liver failure (ALF). Methods: Three hundred and seventy eight male CHB patients with ALF and 441 asymptomatic HBV carriers (AsCs) were recruited. AR CAG repeats numbers were analyzed. The serum testosterone levels of AsCs, ALFs and patients with hepatitis B flare groups, and sequential serum samples, were assessed quantitatively. Results: The median CAG repeat (M-CAG) frequency was significantly higher in ALF patients than AsCs (P, 0. 001). Patients with M-CAG alleles (P, 0. 001, OR 3. 0, 95 % CI 2. 1 – 4. 2) had the highest risk for ALF.

Coronal temperatures of up to 5 MK and frequent minor variability support this picture. During the flare, that is accompanied by a significant brightening in the near-UV, plasma temperatures of 25 - 30 MK are observed and an X-ray luminosity of L_x= 8 x 10 ^ 27 erg/s is reached.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} a multi-factorial analysis of atmospheric noise pollution level based on emitted carbon and heat radiation during gas flaring. An empirical model; three factorial in nature was derived, validated {{and used for}} the noise pollution level analysis. The derived model showed that the noise pollution level was basically dependent on gas flaring output parameters such as emitted carbon and heat radiation since the three occur at the same time, and also on reference distance from <b>flare</b> <b>point,</b> total associated gas and total gas produced. The validity of the model; ϑ=D Log ϕ[Log ϕ (0. 0001 ζ 2 +ζ) +₰]- 1 was rooted on the core model expression D / ϑ ≈ S ζ 2 + ζ + (₰ / Log ϕ) where {{both sides of the}} expression are correspondingly approximately equal. Regression model was used to generate results of noise pollution level, and its trend of distribution was compared with that from derived model as a way of verifying its validity relative to experimental results. The results of this verification translated into very close alignment of curves, dimensions of shapes and areas covered. These translated into significantly similar trend of data point’s distribution for experimental (ExD), derived model (MoD) and regression model-predicted (ReG) results. Evaluations from generated results indicated that noise pollution level per unit radiated heat & emitted carbon as obtained from experiment and derived model were 60. 42 and 60. 00 dBA / Kw m- 2 & 4. 01 x 10 - 4 and 3. 98 x 10 -...|$|E

We apply conservation of particles, energy and momentum to derive the variations of pressure and density along the jets and show that there are self-consistent solutions for deceleration by injection of thermal matter. We initially take the jets to be in pressure equilibrium with the external medium at large distances from the nucleus and the momentum flux to be Π = Φ/c, where Φ is the energy flux; we then progressively relax these constraints. With our initial assumptions, the energy flux is well determined: Φ ≈ 9 – 14 × 10 36 W.

The light curves reveal frequent flaring during all four observations. We perform a uniform spectral analysis and determine plasma temperatures, abundances and emission measures in different states of activity. Applying multi-temperature models with variable abundances separately to data obtained with the EPIC and RGS detectors {{we are able to}} investigate the consistency of the results obtained by the different instruments onboard XMM-Newton. We find that the X-ray properties of the sample M dwarfs are very similar, with the coronal abundances of all sample stars following a trend of increasing abundance with increasing first ionization potential, the inverse FIP effect. The overall metallicities are below solar photospheric ones but appear consistent with the measured photospheric abundances of M dwarfs like these.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a new paradigm}} for understanding both relativistic motions and particle acceleration in the M 87 jet: a magnetically dominated relativistic flow that naturally produces four relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shocks (forward/reverse fast and slow modes). We apply this model {{to a set of}} optical super- and subluminal motions discovered by Biretta and coworkers with the Hubble Space Telescope during 1994 [...] 1998. The model concept consists of ejection of a single relativistic Poynting jet, which possesses a coherent helical (poloidal + toroidal) magnetic component, at the remarkably <b>flaring</b> <b>point</b> HST- 1. We are able to reproduce quantitatively proper motions of components seen in the optical observations of HST- 1 with the same model we used previously to describe similar features in radio VLBI observations in 2005 [...] 2006. This indicates that the quad relativistic MHD shock model can be applied generally to recurring pairs of super/subluminal knots ejected from the upstream edge of the HST- 1 complex as observed from radio to optical wavelengths, with forward/reverse fast-mode MHD shocks then responsible for observed moving features. Moreover, we identify such intrinsic properties as the shock compression ratio, degree of magnetization, and magnetic obliquity and show that they are suitable to mediate diffusive shock acceleration of relativistic particles via the first-order Fermi process. We suggest that relativistic MHD shocks in Poynting-flux dominated helical jets {{may play a role in}} explaining observed emission and proper motions in many AGNs.

Consideration is given to Skylab and other observations of flare-associated sprays, eruptive prominences, surges and coronal transients, and to MHD, gas dynamic and magnetic loop models developed to account for them. Magnetic forces are found to confine spray material, which originates in preexisting active-region filaments, within steadily expanding loops, while surges follow unmoving, preexisting magnetic field lines. Simulations of effects of a sudden pressure pulse {{at the bottom of}} the corona are found to exhibit many characteristics of coronal transients associated with flares, and impulsive heating low in the chromosphere is found to be able to account for surges. The importance of the magnetic field as the ultimate source of energy which drives eruptive phenomena as well as <b>flares</b> is <b>pointed</b> out...|$|R
