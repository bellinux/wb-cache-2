5|$|Commercial sashimi tuna steaks {{may have}} their {{coloration}} fixated {{by the use}} of flushing with carbon monoxide (CO), whereby CO is pumped into bags containing the tuna, which is then stored at 4° Celsius. The duration of time for color <b>fixation</b> to occur varies per the size of the meat. For example, a two-inch tuna steak takes twenty-four hours for color <b>fixation</b> to be completed using this process. When utilized, color <b>fixation</b> using CO occurs prior to the vacuum sealing of tuna steaks for storage. In Japan, color <b>fixation</b> using CO is prohibited.|$|E

40|$|In visual search, some <b>fixations</b> {{are made}} between stimuli on empty regions, {{commonly}} referred to as "centre-of-gravity" <b>fixations</b> (henceforth: COG <b>fixations).</b> Previous studies have shown that observers with task expertise show more COG <b>fixations</b> than novices. This led to the view that COG <b>fixations</b> reflect simultaneous encoding of multiple stimuli, allowing more efficient processing of task-related items. The present study tested whether COG <b>fixations</b> also aid performance in visual search tasks with unfamiliar and abstract stimuli. Moreover, to provide evidence for the multiple-item processing view, we analysed the effects of COG <b>fixations</b> on the number and dwell times of stimulus <b>fixations.</b> The results showed that (1) search efficiency increased with increasing COG <b>fixations</b> even in search for unfamiliar stimuli {{and in the absence of}} special higher-order skills, (2) COG <b>fixations</b> reliably reduced the number of stimulus <b>fixations</b> and their dwell times, indicating processing of multiple distractors, and (3) the proportion of COG <b>fixations</b> was dynamically adapted to potential information gain of COG locations.

5|$|Although oxygen once {{promoted}} nitrogen <b>fixation</b> {{by making}} molybdenum available in water, it also directly poisons nitrogenase enzymes. Thus, in Earth's ancient history, after oxygen arrived {{in large quantities}} in Earth's air and water, organisms that continued to fix nitrogen in aerobic conditions isolated and protected their nitrogen-fixing enzymes from too much oxygen in heterocysts or equivalent structures. This structural isolation of nitrogen <b>fixation</b> reactions in aerobic organisms continues to the present.|$|E

40|$|Eye movements, {{comprising}} predominantly <b>fixations</b> and saccades, {{are known}} to reveal information about perception and cognition, and they provide an explicit measure of attention. Nevertheless, <b>fixations</b> have not been considered as events in the analyses of data obtained during {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) experiments. Most likely, this is due to their brevity and statistical properties. Despite these limitations, we used <b>fixations</b> as events to model brain activation in a free viewing experiment with standard fMRI scanning parameters. First, we found that <b>fixations</b> on different objects in different task contexts resulted in distinct cortical patterns of activation. Second, using multivariate pattern analysis, we showed that the BOLD signal revealed meaningful information about the task context of individual <b>fixations</b> and about the object being inspected during these <b>fixations.</b> We conclude that fixation-based event-related (FIBER) fMRI analysis creates new pathways for studying human brain function by enabling researchers to explore natural viewing behavior.

50|$|A central {{aspect of}} music reading is the {{sequence}} of alternating saccades and <b>fixations,</b> {{as it is for}} most oculomotor tasks. Saccades are the rapid ‘flicks’ that move the eyes from location to location over a music score. Saccades are separated from each other by <b>fixations,</b> during which the eyes are relatively stationary on the page. It is well established that the perception of visual information occurs almost entirely during <b>fixations</b> and that little if any information is picked up during saccades. <b>Fixations</b> comprise about 90% of music reading time, typically averaging 250-400 ms in duration.|$|R
5|$|Azotobacter can fix {{at least}} 10 μg of {{nitrogen}} per gram of glucose consumed. Nitrogen <b>fixation</b> requires molybdenum ions, {{but they can}} be partially or completely replaced by vanadium ions. If atmospheric nitrogen is not fixed, the source of nitrogen can alternatively be nitrates, ammonium ions, or amino acids. The optimal pH for the growth and nitrogen <b>fixation</b> is 7.0–7.5, but growth is sustained in the pH range from 4.8 to 8.5. Azotobacter can also grow mixotrophically, in a molecular-nitrogen-free medium containing mannose; this growth mode is hydrogen-dependent. Hydrogen is available in the soil, thus this growth mode may occur in nature.|$|E
5|$|For a long time, {{sources of}} {{nitrogen}} compounds were limited. Natural sources originated either from biology or deposits of nitrates produced by atmospheric reactions. Nitrogen <b>fixation</b> by industrial processes like the Frank–Caro process (1895–1899) and Haber–Bosch process (1908–1913) eased this shortage of nitrogen compounds, {{to the extent}} that half of global food production (see Applications) now relies on synthetic nitrogen fertilisers. At the same time, use of the Ostwald process (1902) to produce nitrates from industrial nitrogen <b>fixation</b> allowed the large-scale industrial production of nitrates as feedstock in the manufacture of explosives in the World Wars of the 20th century.|$|E

Thus, gathering information over a specific scene region results from {{a growing number of}} <b>fixations</b> on that particular region.

5|$|The {{energy in}} {{sunlight}} is captured by plants, cyanobacteria, purple bacteria, green sulfur bacteria and some protists.

5|$|The {{expected}} {{number of}} generations for <b>fixation</b> to occur {{is proportional to}} the population size, such that <b>fixation</b> is predicted to occur much more rapidly in smaller populations. Normally the effective population size, which is smaller than the total population, is used to determine these probabilities. The effective population (N'e) takes into account factors such as the level of inbreeding, the stage of the lifecycle in which the population is the smallest, and the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection. The effective population size may not be the same for every gene in the same population.|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the distributions of driver eye <b>fixations</b> when follow-ing other vehicles. The {{aim was to}} describe {{the areas of the}} forward field of view that are most frequently fixated. Such information is important for select-ing optimal locations for automobile brake lights: Brake lights that are closer to eye <b>fixations</b> are likely to result in shorter driver reaction times than brake lights farther away from the <b>fixations.</b> A head-mounted, corneal-reflection device was used to monitor eye <b>fixations.</b> The data were collected during daylight hours in slow-moving urban traffic.

The results provide a possible behavioral explanation for the accident reductions found with high-mounted brake lights in previous field studies.

5|$|Azotobacter {{species are}} free-living, nitrogen-fixing bacteria; in {{contrast}} to Rhizobium species, they normally fix molecular nitrogen from the atmosphere without symbiotic relations with plants, although some Azotobacter species are associated with plants.

5|$|Photo{{synthesis}} is {{the synthesis}} of carbohydrates from sunlight and carbon dioxide (CO2). In plants, cyanobacteria and algae, oxygenic photosynthesis splits water, with oxygen produced as a waste product. This process uses the ATP and NADPH produced by the photosynthetic reaction centres, as described above, to convert CO2 into glycerate 3-phosphate, which can then be converted into glucose. This carbon-fixation reaction is {{carried out by the}} enzyme RuBisCO as part of the Calvin– Benson cycle. Three types of photosynthesis occur in plants, C3 carbon <b>fixation,</b> C4 carbon <b>fixation</b> and CAM photosynthesis. These differ by the route that carbon dioxide takes to the Calvin cycle, with C3 plants fixing CO2 directly, while C4 and CAM photosynthesis incorporate the CO2 into other compounds first, as adaptations to deal with intense sunlight and dry conditions.|$|E

40|$|Eye {{tracking}} {{has been}} used during face categorisation and identification tasks to identify perceptually salient facial features and infer underlying cognitive processes.

In order to investigate potential interactions between gaze biases uniquely associated with facial expression processing, and those associated with screen location, face stimuli were presented in three possible screen positions to the left, right and centre. Comparisons of <b>fixations</b> between screen locations highlight a significant impact of the screen centre bias, pulling <b>fixations</b> towards the centre of the screen and modifying gaze biases generally observed during facial categorisation tasks.
