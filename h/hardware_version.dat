25|$|IBM {{continued}} to market OS/2, producing later versions in OS/2 3.0 and 4.0 (also called Warp). Responding to complaints about OS/2 2.0's high demands on computer <b>hardware,</b> <b>version</b> 3.0 was significantly optimized both for speed and size. Before Windows 95 was released, OS/2 Warp 3.0 was even shipped preinstalled with several large German hardware vendor chains. However, {{with the release}} of Windows 95, OS/2 began to lose market share.|$|E

25|$|The Sansa Fuze, {{released}} on March 28, 2008 in capacities of 2, 4 and 8GB, is a portable media player with a 1.9-inch color display and a thickness of 0.3inches. It {{also features a}} 40-preset FM radio with FM recording, a voice recorder, and has a 24-hour battery life on continuous audio playback. Storage is expandable via a microSDHC slot. Firmware 1.01.22 enabled FLAC and Ogg Vorbis playback. Like the Clip, the Fuze went through two hardware revisions, the first based on the AS3525 (like the Clipv1) and the second based on the AS3525+ (like the Clipv2, Clip+ and Clip Zip). The latest firmware releases, depending on <b>hardware</b> <b>version,</b> are 01.02.31, 02.03.31 and 02.03.33.|$|E

30|$|We propose two {{different}} <b>hardware</b> <b>versions</b> (HW_v 1 and HW_v 2). With register-based HW_v 1, a customized and parallel processing architecture is introduced {{to perform the}} matrix computations in parallel by mostly utilizing registers to store the data/results. With Block Random Access Memory (BRAM)-based HW_v 2, an optimized architecture is introduced to address certain issues that have arisen with HW_v 1, by employing BRAMs to store the data/results. These two <b>hardware</b> <b>versions</b> {{can be used in}} different scenarios, depending on the requirements of the application.|$|R
2500|$|With the Attitude Adjustment (12.09) {{release of}} OpenWrt, all WRT54G <b>hardware</b> <b>versions</b> with 16MB of RAM {{are no longer}} supported, and older Backfire (10.03) is {{recommended}} instead. [...] Issues came from dropping support for the legacy Broadcom target brcm-2.4, making lower end devices run out of memory easily. [...] Support for Attitude Adjustment is limited to WRT54G <b>hardware</b> <b>versions</b> with 32MB of RAM, what includes WRT54GS and (apart from performing RAM upgrades through hardware modifications) some of the WRT54G and WRT54GL versions having the capability for unlocking their additional 16MB of RAM.|$|R

30|$|Typically, {{not all the}} {{constraints}} are active at the same time, making λ a sparse vector. Since only the active constraints need to be considered, both <b>hardware</b> <b>versions</b> are designed {{in such a way}} to execute the sparse vector to reduce the total computations involved for the operation.|$|R
30|$|With both <b>hardware</b> <b>versions,</b> we {{introduce}} {{novel and}} unique sub-modules, including multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) modules that {{are capable of}} processing matrices of varying sizes, and distinguishing and handling the sparse versus dense matrices, to reduce the execution time. These sub-modules further enhance the speedup and area-efficiency of the overall fast-charge MPC algorithm.|$|R

50|$|There {{are four}} {{hardware}} {{versions of the}} TI-89. These versions are normally referred to as HW1, HW2, HW3, and HW4 (released in May 2006). Entering the key sequence F1 A displays the <b>hardware</b> <b>version.</b> Older OS versions (before 2.00) don't display anything about the <b>hardware</b> <b>version</b> unless the calculator is HW2 or later. The differences in the hardware versions are not well documented by Texas Instruments. HW1 and HW2 correspond to the original TI-89; HW3 and HW4 are only present in the TI-89 Titanium.|$|E

3000|$|As {{demonstrated}} in Fig.  7, both <b>hardware</b> <b>versions</b> {{have the same}} internal architecture for computing the Φ matrix. In this case, HW_v 1 waits until Φ matrix computation is completed and then loads Grf and Gff. Also, HW_v 1 employs two gain matrix modules to compute [Φ_v, 0.5 em G_nfv, 0.5 em G_ffv] [...] and [Φ_z, 0.5 em G_nfz, 0.5 em G_ffz] [...] matrices in parallel.|$|R

2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common {{criticism}} is that the term is unclear or simply a buzzword. [...] For many {{people who work in}} software, version numbers like 2.0 and 3.0 are for software <b>versioning</b> or <b>hardware</b> <b>versioning</b> only, and to assign 2.0 arbitrarily to many technologies with a variety of real version numbers has no meaning. [...] The web does not have a version number.

30|$|For HW_v 1, {{in stage}} 1, the {{parameter}} module is excluded {{due to the}} resource constraints on chip. In this case, for HW_v 1, the temperature-dependent parameters are considered as constants and stored in the registers, {{on the premise that}} the temperature will remain constant [4]. In this paper, for the experimental results and analysis (in Section 5), we consider the temperature to be constant for both <b>hardware</b> <b>versions.</b> With the current experimental setup, the additional parameter module does not impact the precision or the performance of the proposed embedded designs.|$|R
40|$|Two digital {{microwave}} {{landing system}} theoretical models are considered which are generic models for the Doppler and scanning-beam frequency reference versions of the MLS. These models represent errors resulting from both system noise and discrete multipath. The data used for the validation effort {{were obtained from the}} Texas Instrument conventional scanning beam and the Hazeltine Doppler feasibility <b>hardware</b> <b>versions</b> of the MLS. Topics discussed include tape read software, time history plots, computation of power spectral density, smoothed power spectra, best-fit models, different equations for digital simulation, and discrete multipath errors...|$|R
