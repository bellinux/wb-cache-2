5|$|According to {{a review}} of 51 studies from 21 countries, the average {{incidence}} of subarachnoid hemorrhage is 9.1 per 100,000 annually. Studies from Japan and Finland show higher rates in those countries (22.7 and 19.7, respectively), <b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> that are not entirely understood. South and Central America, in contrast, have a rate of 4.2 per 100,000 on average.|$|E
5|$|After {{falling out}} of favor with Ali Pasha, <b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> unknown, Meksi left the court in 1810 to travel around Europe. During a brief stay in Venice he began to develop an {{interest}} in the Albanian alphabet and grammar. He published two translations into Albanian during 1814, both now lost, one of which was a religious work by Abbé Claude Fleury (1640–1723).|$|E

5|$|Aristagoras {{was also}} {{successful}} in persuading {{the city of}} Eretria to send assistance to the Ionians <b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> that are not completely clear. Possibly commercial reasons were a factor; Eretria was a mercantile city, whose trade was threatened by Persian dominance of the Aegean. Herodotus suggests that the Eretrians supported the revolt in order to repay the support the Milesians had given Eretria some time previously, possibly referring to the Lelantine War.|$|E
5|$|Auxiliary regiments {{were often}} {{stationed}} in provinces {{other than that}} {{in which they were}} originally raised, <b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> of security and to foster the process of Romanisation in the provinces. The regimental names of many auxiliary units persisted into the 4th century, but by then the units in question were different in size, structure, and quality from their predecessors.|$|E
5|$|Dorothy soon fell in {{love with}} Pound. In late 1909 and early 1910 Olivia and Dorothy {{attended}} his lectures at the London Polytechnic Institution; in June 1910 they joined him in Sirmione, Italy. <b>For</b> <b>reasons</b> unclear to biographers Olivia forbade the two from writing to each other during his extended visit to New York from 1910-11. Despite the restriction Dorothy seems to have considered herself engaged to Pound, although uncertain whether he intended to stay in New York or return to London.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{encroaching}} Interstate highways—especially Interstate 35—the {{middle section}} of the route through Norman, Moore, and Oklahoma City was decommissioned in 1979 <b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> of redundancy.

In 1957, intrigued {{by the sound of}} a kind of drum made by Leedy (then owned by Slingerland), he had a line made for him that also became popular with other drummers. In the 1970s, after trying and abandoning many others <b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> of sound or maintainability, he settled on the Japanese-made Pearl Drums.|$|E
