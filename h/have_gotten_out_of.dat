5|$|TGS head writer Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is {{assigned}} to solve a public relations problem caused by the show's stars, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) and Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski), during their hosting duties of the St. Patrick's Day parade, in which Jenna passed out and Tracy cursed during the live television broadcast. To make things worse, Liz is summoned to jury duty and cannot avoid it despite claiming to be Princess Leia. When she leaves for jury duty, she does not leave anyone in charge and allows the staff to go without directionâ€”until later when she puts NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) in charge after learning that the staff <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> hand. Liz is on a court case about a woman, named Rochelle Gaulke (Jackie Hoffman), whose work life and frustrations parallel her own; the two both have employees named Tracy and Jenna, both believe their employees waste their time, and make their lives difficult.|$|E

60|$|Among other witnesses, {{there is}} one who had a 'jumping toothache,' which several times tempted her to 'believe that there was {{sensation}} in matter, but each time it was overcome {{by the power of}} Truth.' She would not allow the dentist to use cocaine, but sat there and let him punch and drill and split and crush the tool, and tear and slash its ulcerations, and pull out the nerve, and dig out fragments of bone; and she wouldn't once confess that it hurt. And to this day she thinks it didn't, and I have not a doubt that she is nine-tenths right, and that her Christian Science faith did her better service than she could <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> cocaine.|$|E
60|$|Having reached our {{limit for}} {{daylight}} work, {{we set up}} a couple of candles and played at night. As the alley was fifty or sixty feet long, we couldn't see the pins, but the candles indicated their locality. We continued this game until we were able to knock down the invisible pins with thirty-six shots. Having now reached the limit of the candle game, we changed and played it left-handed. We continued the left-handed game until we conquered its limit, which was fifty-four shots. Sometimes we sent down a succession of fifteen balls without getting anything at all. We easily got out of that old alley five times the fun that anybody could <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the best alley in New York.|$|E

60|$|So {{very early}} the next morning Little Joe Otter went to the best fishing pool he knew of in the Laughing Brook, and there he caught the biggest trout he could find. It was so big and fat that it made Little Joe's mouth water, for you know fat trout are his {{favorite}} food. But he didn't take so much as one bite. Instead he carefully laid it on an old log where Buster Bear would be sure to see it if he should come along that way. Then he hid near by, where he could watch. Buster was late that morning. It seemed to Little Joe that he never would come. Once he nearly lost the fish. He had turned his head for just a minute, and when he looked back again, the trout was nowhere to be seen. Buster couldn't have stolen up and taken it, because such a big fellow couldn't possibly <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sight again.|$|E

5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film 2.5 stars {{out of a}} {{possible}} 4 stating, [...] "With a cleaner story line, the basic idea could have been free to deliver. As it is, we get a better movie than we might have, because the performances are so good: Spacey as a vulnerable and wounded man; Hunt as a woman no less wounded in her own way, and Osment, once again proving himself the equal of adult actors in the complexity and depth of his performance. I believed in them and cared for them. I wish the movie could <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their way." ...|$|E
