50|$|A {{flexible}} <b>impeller</b> <b>pump</b> is a positive-displacement pump that, by deforming impeller vanes, {{draws the}} liquid into the pump housing and moves {{it to the}} discharge port with a constant flow rate. The flexibility of the vanes enables a tight seal to the internal housing, making the pump self-priming, while also permitting bi-directional operation. The output from these pumps tends to be smooth or gentle {{when compared to the}} operation of a reciprocating pump (for example). In 1938, Arthur M. Briggs filed a patent for this type of pump.|$|E

Studies were conducted with a 6 blade radial impeller and a 3 blade axial impeller.

50|$|During {{its service}} the tank {{proved to be}} not entirely adapted to winter conditions, due to an {{incomplete}} draining of the cooling system, caused by a water pump system that had been modified to reduce engine height. A small shaft would break after the <b>impeller</b> <b>pump</b> froze. The repair of the shaft, considering the field conditions, proved very impractical and required three people. Two people had to hold a third person by the legs and lower him into the engine bay, where he had to loosen the fastening and remove the broken shaft. Then, he was pulled out and lowered back down to install the new shaft. He was repeatedly lowered until the new part was secured. Another serious problem discovered during the winter conditions was that the crews of the T-44A suffered from frostbite because of the complete lack of a heating system. The driver {{was supposed to be}} protected from rain and snow by a removable Tarpaulin cover with a small glass window. However, this was not successful and its use was deemed impractical.|$|E
5000|$|The {{patented}} process uses sponge rubber balls which are {{injected into the}} cooling water flow (1) before it enters into the condenser. The diameter of the cleaning balls is only slightly bigger than the nominal diameter of the condenser tubing. Due to their elasticity they generate a contact pressure on {{their way through the}} condenser tubes by which fouling is removed from the inner tube walls. At the condenser outlet a strainer (2) is installed in the connecting pipe which separates the balls from the water flow and feeds them into a DN 80 pipe. From there the balls are pumped back to their starting point by a 4 kW <b>impeller</b> <b>pump</b> via a DN 80 pipe. To inject the balls into the cycle, a pressure vessel with detachable cover is installed downstream of the pump. This so-called collector (3b) is equipped with a screen and a [...] At open flap, the balls can pass and with closed flap they remain in the collector and can be replenished or exchanged. The process works continuously and the tubes remain free of mud, algae, bacteria and scaling. The operation of the system is ed via sight glasses and electronic measuring instruments. The screen surfaces are arranged on shafts with pivoted bearings and can be turned on demand to have fouling removed by the water flow. In this process the balls are caught in the collector. This time-consuming procedure is automatized (3c), gear motors (M) operate the relevant actuators. The minal diameters of the screens have been adjusted to respond to the developments in power station technology and are produced in sizes from nominal diameter 150 mm to 3600 mm. The cleaning ball diameters range from 14 to 30 mm and filling one collector normally requires several hundred of them. However, some cleaning systems can require well over a thousand cleaning balls. The lifetime of the cleaning balls which are produced of biodegradable natural rubber is around 4 weeks.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Since 1980 s, the author’s <b>impeller</b> <b>pump</b> has {{successively}} {{achieved the}} device implantability, blood compatibility and flow pulsatility. In order to realize a performance durability, {{the author has}} concentrated in past years on solving the bearing problems of the <b>impeller</b> <b>pump.</b> Recent progress has been obtained in developing durable and permanent impeller blood pumps. At first, a durable <b>impeller</b> <b>pump</b> with rolling bearing and purge system has been developed, in which the wear-less rollers made of super-high-molecular weight polythene make the pump to work for years without mechanical wear; and the purge system enables the bearing to work in saline and heparin, and no thrombus therefore could be formed. Secondly, a durable centrifugal pump with rolling bearing and axially reciprocating impeller has been developed, the axial reciprocation of rotating impeller makes the fresh blood {{in and out of}} the bearing and to wash the rollers once a circle; in such way, no thrombus could be formed and no fluid infusion is necessary, which may bring inconvenience and discomfort to the receptors. Finally, a permanent maglev <b>impeller</b> <b>pump</b> has been developed, its rotor is suspended and floating in the blood under the action of permanent magnetic force and nonmagnetic forces, without need for position measurement and feed-back control. In conclusion, an implantable, pulsatile, and blood compatible <b>impeller</b> <b>pump</b> with durability may have more extensive applications than ever before and could replace the donor heart for transplantation in the future.

This process utilizes air-water contact to transfer oxygen. As the water is propelled into the air, it breaks into small droplets. Collectively, these small droplets have a large surface area through which oxygen can be transferred. Upon return, these droplets mix {{with the rest of the}} water and thus transfer their oxygen back to the ecosystem.|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} made of the pumping {{capacity}} of pitched blade impellers in a cylindrical pilot plant vessel with four standard radial baffles at the wall under a turbulent regime of flow. The pumping capacity was calculated from the radial profile of the axial flow, under the assumption of axial symmetry of the discharge flow. The mean velocity was measured using laser Doppler anemometry in a transparent vessel of diameter T = 400 mm, provided with a standard dished bottom. Three and six blade pitched blade impellers (the pitch angle varied within the interval a Îá 24 °; 45 °ń) of impeller/vessel diameter ratio D/T = 0. 36, as well as a three blade pitched blade impeller with folded blades of the same diameter, were tested. The calculated results were compared with the results of experiments mentioned in the literature, above all in cylindrical vessels with a flat bottom. Both arrangements of the agitated system were described by the impeller energetic efficiency, i. e, a criterion including in dimensionless form both the impeller energy consumption (impeller power input) and the <b>impeller</b> <b>pumping</b> effect (<b>impeller</b> <b>pumping</b> capacity). It follows from the results obtained with various geometrical configurations that the energetic efficiency of pitched blade impellers is significantly lower for configurations suitable for mixing solid-liquid suspensions (low impeller off bottom clearances) than for blending miscible liquids in mixing (higher impeller off bottom clearances) ...|$|R
40|$|Background—The latest {{generation}} of left ventricular assist devices consists of nonpulsatile <b>impeller</b> <b>pumps.</b> In these small pumps, thrombus formation inside the device {{does not lead}} to thromboembolic end-organ dysfunction but may dramatically impair pump flow. We report on our experience with thrombus-related pump dysfunctions of the MicroMed DeBakey left ventricular assist device and its treatment. Methods—Eight of 22 patients with a MicroMed DeBakey VAD presented with a critically reduced pump flow. In 7 cases, an increased power demand indicative of progressive thrombus formation associated with the device was evident, whereas 1 case presented with thrombus formation within the inflow conduit associated with a very low power demand. Brief spontaneously resolving pump stops had been noted in 6 patients. All 8 patients were treated with 100 mg of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), administered via an IV line. Results—Rt-PA lysis led to an increase of pump flow along with a reduction of power demand within a short time in all patients. No severe bleeding complications occurred. However, 4 patients experienced transient epistaxis. All patients could be discharged from intensive care immediately after discontinuation of thrombolytic therapy. Conclusion—Rt-PA lysis is a very effective tool for thrombus-related pump dysfunction in patients with <b>impeller</b> <b>pumps,</b> which renders emergency surgical exchange unnecessary in most cases.

40|$|ObjectiveIn a univentricular Fontan circulation, modest {{augmentation}} {{of existing}} cavopulmonary pressure head (2 – 5 mm Hg) would reduce systemic venous pressure, increase ventricular filling, and thus substantially improve circulatory status. An ideal means of providing mechanical cavopulmonary support does not exist. We hypothesized that a viscous <b>impeller</b> <b>pump,</b> {{based on the}} von Kármán viscous pump principle, is optimal for this role. MethodsA 3 -dimensional computational model of the total cavopulmonary connection was created. The impeller was represented as a smooth 2 -sided conical actuator disk with rotation in the vena caval axis. Flow was modeled under 3 conditions: (1) passive flow with no disc; (2) passive flow with a nonrotating disk, and (3) induced flow with disc rotation (0 – 5 K rpm). Flow patterns and hydraulic performance were examined for each case. Hydraulic performance for a vaned impeller was assessed by measuring pressure increase and induced flow over 0 to 7 K rpm in a laboratory mock loop. ResultsA nonrotating actuator disc stabilized cavopulmonary flow, reducing power loss by 88 %. Disk rotation (from baseline dynamic flow of 4. 4 L/min) resulted in a pressure increase of 0. 03 mm Hg. A further increase in pressure of 5 to 20 mm Hg and 0 to 5 L/min flow was obtained with a vaned impeller at 0 to 7 K rpm in a laboratory mock loop. ConclusionsA single viscous <b>impeller</b> <b>pump</b> stabilizes and augments cavopulmonary flow in 4 directions, in the desired pressure range, without venous pathway obstruction. A viscous <b>impeller</b> <b>pump</b> applies to the existing staged protocol as a temporary bridge-to-recovery or -transplant in established univentricular Fontan circulations and may enable compressed palliation of single ventricle {{without the need for}} intermediary surgical staging or use of a systemic-to-pulmonary arterial shunt...|$|E

It seems all efforts and successes have been done in vain because artificial heart rejects Hi-Tech! This paper recalls some important achievements in R&D of artificial heart in past 25 years and shares author’s experiences with the readers. PULSATILE OR NONPULSATILE FLOW In the early 1980 s, people did not know whether a nonpulsatile pump could support the circulation partly or totally. Most medical doctors preferred to use pulsatile flow pumps, but the serious problems resulted in the application of diaphragm pumps forced the researchers to change the pumping principle. It followed thereafter two tendencies that some one tried to maintain the animal circulation with nonpulsatile flow as long as possible and others made efforts to develop a pulsatile rotary pump. The conflict of nonpulsatile or pulsatile perfusion lasted to the end of 1990 s. As the author published a pulsatile <b>impeller</b> <b>pump</b> with low hemolysis (Artificial Organs, 1989 / 13 / 02 P 162 - 169), the nonpulsatile pump could make the animal experimental survival only few weeks. Then the author received over 20 international invitations for giving lectures, sending reprints or writing new papers. In the following 10 years, however, nonpulsatile pump achieved long-term survival in animal experiments worldwide [1], and now a patient has lived by a nonpulsatile pump for about 7 years [2]. Thereby, nobody concerns pulsatile rotary pump any more. Fig. (1). Pulsatile <b>impeller</b> <b>pump</b> changes its rotating speed periodically to produce flow waves and thereby its rotor reciprocates axially under action of hydraulic force and magnetic force in motor. *Address correspondence to this author at the Jiangsu University, Biomedica...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: It {{is evident}} that a pulsatile flow is {{important}} for blood circulation because the flow pulsatility can reduce the resistance of peripheral vessels. It is difficult, however, to produce a pulsatile flow with an <b>impeller</b> <b>pump,</b> since blood damage will occur when a pulsatile flow is produced. Further investigation has revealed that the main factor for blood damage is turbulence shear, which tears the membranes of red blood cells, resulting in free release of haemoglobin into the plasma, and consequently lead to haemolysis. Therefore, the question for producing a pulsatile flow with low haemolysis becomes how to develop a pulsatile <b>impeller</b> <b>pump</b> with less turbulence? The authors have successively developed a pulsatile axial pump and a pulsatile centrifugal pump. In the pulsatile axial pump, the impeller reciprocates axially and rotates simultaneously. The reciprocation is driven by a pneumatic device and the rotation by a DC motor. For a pressure of 40 mm Hg pulsatility, about 50 mm axially reciprocation amplitude of the impeller is desirable. In {{order to reduce the}} axial amplitude, the pump inlet and the impeller both have cone-shaped heads, thus the gap between the impeller and the inlet pipe changes by only 2 mm, that is, the impeller reciprocates up to 2 mm, a pressure pulsatility of 40 mmHg can be produced. As the impeller rotates with a constant speed, low turbulence in the pump can be expected. In the centrifugal pulsatile pump, the impelle...|$|E
