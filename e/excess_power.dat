Cerritos receives 10 megawatts, or 4% of the total output, to power public facilities, park lighting, traffic signals and water wells. <b>Excess</b> <b>power</b> (approximately 5 megawatts) is sold to public and/or private agencies.|$|E
25|$|Negros Oriental has, {{for a long}} time, been a major {{supplier}} of electricity to its neighboring provinces in the Visayas with its <b>excess</b> <b>power</b> capacity generated by the 192.5-MW Palinpinon geothermal plant. This plant has recently been expanded with an additional 49MW capacity, bringing total power output of the province to over 240MW. Despite the huge power excess of the Province, other power sources such as hydro, wind and solar are being explored to provide additional power capacities that can be sold to neighboring areas.|$|E
25|$|The Reykjavík buses {{are part}} of a larger program, HyFLEET:CUTE, {{operating}} hydrogen fueled buses in eight European cities. HyFLEET:CUTE buses were also operated in Beijing, China and Perth, Australia (see below). A pilot project demonstrating a hydrogen economy is operational on the Norwegian island of Utsira. The installation combines wind power and hydrogen power. In periods when there is surplus wind energy, the <b>excess</b> <b>power</b> is used for generating hydrogen by electrolysis. The hydrogen is stored, and is available for power generation in periods when there is little wind.|$|E

25|$|The <b>excess</b> <b>power</b> {{generation}} {{capacity available}} in India is nearly 500 billion units/year presently and another 75,000 MW conventional power generating capacity is in pipeline excluding the targeted 175,000 MW renewable power by 2022. The hydrogen fuel generated by 500 billion units of electricity can replace all diesel and petrol consumed by heavy and medium duty vehicles in India completely obviating {{the need of}} crude oil imports for internal consumption. Converting petrol/diesel driven road vehicles in to fuel cell electric vehicles on priority would save the huge import cost of crude oil and transform the stranded electricity infrastructure in to productive assets with major boost to the overall economic growth.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, {{the power}} plant {{was in the process}} of {{upgrading}} from solely managing the electricity brought in from Con Edison to a 40-megawatt tri-generation facility with the ability to use oil, gas or steam (depending on market conditions) to power turbines to produce its own energy. The final cost of this energy independence could be as much as $90 million, but it is hoped to pay for itself with the savings earned—with conservative estimates at $18 million annually—within several years. Also, whatever <b>excess</b> <b>power</b> generated after satisfying the community's needs will be sold back to the electrical grid, adding another source of income for RiverBay.|$|E

40|$|Results on {{measurements}} of <b>excess</b> heat <b>power,</b> impurity nuclides yield, gamma and X-ray emission in experiments with high-current glow discharge (GD) in D 2, Xe and Kr are presented. The cathode samples {{used in the}} experiments were made of Pd, V, Nb, Ta. In experiments with Pd cathode samples in D 2 GD, the recorded <b>excess</b> heat <b>power</b> amounted to 10 – 15 W and the estimated efficiency (the output thermal power {{in relation to the}} input electric power) was up to 130 %. <b>Excess</b> heat <b>power</b> up to 5 W, and efficiency up to 150 % was recorded for deuterium precharged Pd cathode samples in Xe and Kr discharges. Production of impurity nuclides with atomic masses less than and more than that of the cathode material was registered. Considerable deviation from the natural isotopic ratio was observed for the registered elemental impurities. X-ray emission was measured in H 2, D 2, Ar, Xe and Kr GD during the GD operation and after the GD current switch off (up to several hours afterwards) with the help of thermo-luminescent detectors (TLD), X-ray film and scintillator detectors with photomultipliers. The recorded energetic spectra of X-ray emission range 0. 5 – 10 keV. Weak gamma-emission (up to 1, 000 events per second) was registered in certain experimental conditions. The X-ray spectra include both (bands of) the continuum and multiple lines with energies ranging 0. 1 – 3. 0 MeV. The possible mechanism for production of the <b>excess</b> heat <b>power,</b> elemental impurities, gamma and X- ray emission is also considered. 1...|$|R

25|$|Since the Fleischmann and Pons announcement, the Italian National {{agency for}} new technologies, energy and {{sustainable}} economic development (ENEA) has funded Franco Scaramuzzi's research into whether excess heat {{can be measured}} from metals loaded with deuterium gas. Such research is distributed across ENEA departments, CNR laboratories, INFN, universities and industrial laboratories in Italy, where the group continues to try to achieve reliable reproducibility (i.e. getting the phenomenon to happen in every cell, and inside a certain frame of time). In 2006–2007, the ENEA started a research program which claimed to have found <b>excess</b> <b>power</b> of up to 500 percent, and in 2009, ENEA hosted the 15th cold fusion conference.|$|E
25|$|Combined {{heat and}} power (CHP) fuel cell systems, {{including}} Micro {{combined heat and power}} (MicroCHP) systems {{are used to}} generate both electricity and heat for homes (see home fuel cell), office building and factories. The system generates constant electric power (selling <b>excess</b> <b>power</b> back to the grid when it is not consumed), {{and at the same time}} produces hot air and water from the waste heat. As the result CHP systems have the potential to save primary energy as they can make use of waste heat which is generally rejected by thermal energy conversion systems. A typical capacity range of home fuel cell is 1–3kWel / 4–8kWth. CHP systems linked to absorption chillers use their waste heat for refrigeration.|$|E
25|$|A dam which impounds a large {{reservoir}} {{can store}} and release a correspondingly {{large amount of}} energy, by controlling river outflow and raising or lowering its reservoir level a few meters. Limitations do apply to dam operation, their releases are commonly subject to government regulated water rights to limit downstream effect on rivers. For example, there are grid situations where baseload thermal plants, nuclear or wind turbines are already producing <b>excess</b> <b>power</b> at night, dams are still required to release enough water to maintain adequate river levels, whether electricity is generated or not. Conversely there's a limit to peak capacity, which if excessive could cause a river to flood {{for a few hours}} each day.|$|E

25|$|Power to gas is a {{technology}} which converts electrical {{power to a}} gas fuel. There are 2 methods, {{the first is to}} use the electricity for water splitting and inject the resulting hydrogen into the natural gas grid. The second (less efficient) method is used to convert carbon dioxide and water to methane, (see natural gas) using electrolysis and the Sabatier reaction. The <b>excess</b> <b>power</b> or off peak power generated by wind generators or solar arrays is then used for load balancing in the energy grid. Using the existing natural gas system for hydrogen Fuel cell maker Hydrogenics and natural gas distributor Enbridge have teamed up to develop such a power to gas system in Canada.|$|E
25|$|Ramos {{personally}} {{pushed for}} the speedy approval {{of some of the}} most expensive power deals, and justified signing more contracts despite warnings from within the government and the World Bank that an impending oversupply of electricity could push up prices, a situation that persists in the Philippines up to the present. Individuals linked to Ramos lobbied for the approval of some of the contracts for independent power producers (IPPs), which came with numerous other deals, including lucrative legal, technical, and financial consultancies that were given to individuals and companies close to the former president. Among the deals tied to IPP projects were insurance contracts in which companies made millions of dollars in commissions alone. All the IPP contracts came with attractive incentives and guarantees. Every contract was designed to give IPP creditors some degree of comfort in financing ventures that would usually involve huge capital and risks. Most IPPs were funded by foreign loans secured with a form of government guarantee or performance undertaking, which meant that the Philippine government would pay for the loans if the IPPs defaulted. The Ramos government continued signing IPP contracts even after the power crisis had been considered solved by the end of 1993. The World Bank came up with a report in 1994 warning that power rates may rise if the government continued to enter into more IPP contracts that would mean <b>excess</b> <b>power.</b> The World Bank questioned the ambitious projections of the government on economic growth and power demand from 1994 to 1998. It also warned that the power generated by private utilities' IPPs could duplicate those of the National Power Corporation and create an overcapacity. The World Bank said that the factors create considerable uncertainty in power demand, like substantial overcapacity, particularly under take-or-pay conditions, would require considerable tariff increases that would be unpopular with the public. It was said that, presidents since Corazon Aquino catered mostly to the needs of big business for power and allowed the private sector to profit from this lucrative industry rather than craft an energy plan that would meet the needs of the Filipinos.|$|E
