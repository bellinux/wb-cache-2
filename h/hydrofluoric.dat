5|$|Hydrogen and {{fluorine}} {{combine to}} yield hydrogen fluoride, in which discrete molecules form clusters by hydrogen bonding, resembling water more than hydrogen chloride. It boils {{at a much}} higher temperature than heavier hydrogen halides and unlike them is fully miscible with water. Hydrogen fluoride readily hydrates on contact with water to form aqueous hydrogen fluoride, also known as <b>hydrofluoric</b> acid. Unlike the other hydrohalic acids, which are strong, <b>hydrofluoric</b> acid is a weak acid at low concentrations. However, it can attack glass, something the other acids cannot do.|$|E
5|$|Like other soluble fluorides, CsF is {{moderately}} toxic. Contact with acid {{should be}} avoided, as this forms highly toxic/corrosive <b>hydrofluoric</b> acid. The caesium ion (Cs+) and caesium chloride {{are generally not}} considered toxic.|$|E
5|$|Rutherfordium is {{expected}} to have the electron configuration 5f14 6d2 7s2 and therefore behave as the heavier homologue of hafnium in group 4 of the periodic table. It should therefore readily form a hydrated Rf4+ ion in strong acid solution and should readily form complexes in hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic or <b>hydrofluoric</b> acid solutions.|$|E
5|$|In many ways, Niobium {{is similar}} to {{tantalum}} and zirconium. It reacts with most nonmetals at high temperatures; with fluorine at room temperature; with chlorine and hydrogen at 200°C; and with nitrogen at 400°C, with products that are frequently interstitial and nonstoichiometric. The metal begins to oxidize in air at 200°C. It resists corrosion by fused alkalis and by acids, including aqua regia, hydrochloric, sulfuric, nitric and phosphoric acids. Niobium is attacked by <b>hydrofluoric</b> acid and hydrofluoric/nitric acid mixtures.|$|E
5|$|Scandium is a {{soft metal}} with a silvery appearance. It {{develops}} a slightly yellowish or pinkish cast when oxidized by air. It {{is susceptible to}} weathering and dissolves slowly in most dilute acids. It does not react with a 1:1 mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and 48% <b>hydrofluoric</b> acid (HF), possibly due {{to the formation of}} an impermeable passive layer. Scandium turnings ignite in air with a brilliant yellow flame to form scandium(III) oxide.|$|E
5|$|Actinium trifluoride can be {{produced}} either in solution or in solid reaction. The former reaction is carried out at room temperature, by adding <b>hydrofluoric</b> acid to a solution containing actinium ions. In the latter method, actinium metal is treated with hydrogen fluoride vapors at 700°C in an all-platinum setup. Treating actinium trifluoride with ammonium hydroxide at 900–1000°C yields oxyfluoride AcOF. Whereas lanthanum oxyfluoride can be easily obtained by burning lanthanum trifluoride in air at 800°C for an hour, similar treatment of actinium trifluoride yields no AcOF and only results in melting of the initial product.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hydrofluoric</b> acid is {{a contact}} poison with greater hazards than many strong acids like sulfuric acid {{even though it}} is weak: it remains neutral in aqueous {{solution}} and thus penetrates tissue faster, whether through inhalation, ingestion or the skin, and at least nine U.S. workers died in such accidents from 1984 to 1994. It reacts with calcium and magnesium in the blood leading to hypocalcemia and possible death through cardiac arrhythmia. Insoluble calcium fluoride formation triggers strong pain and burns larger than 160cm2 (25in2) can cause serious systemic toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Later, Walt and Jesse {{dispose of}} Victor's body, the gun that killed Gale, {{and the box}} cutter in a barrel of <b>hydrofluoric</b> acid. During breakfast later, Walt insists to Jesse that Gale's death was necessary, but expresses concern that Gus will kill them at his next opportunity. Jesse doubts this, believing {{it will be too}} much trouble for Gus to find another drug manufacturer, and that both they and Gus {{understand}} the situation: neither can kill the other, so Gus might as well make them wish they were dead. The episode ends with police investigating Gale's apartment with the camera focusing on his lab notes which have yet to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|Organofluorides consume over 20% of mined {{fluorite}} {{and over}} 40% of <b>hydrofluoric</b> acid, with refrigerant gases dominating and fluoropolymers increasing their market share. Surfactants are a minor application but generate over $1 {{billion in annual}} revenue. Due to the danger from direct hydrocarbon–fluorine reactions above −150°C (−240°F), industrial fluorocarbon production is indirect, mostly through halogen exchange reactions such as Swarts fluorination, in which chlorocarbon chlorines are substituted for fluorines by hydrogen fluoride under catalysts. Electrochemical fluorination subjects hydrocarbons to electrolysis in hydrogen fluoride, and the Fowler process treats them with solid fluorine carriers like cobalt trifluoride.|$|E
5|$|Soluble {{fluorides}} are moderately toxic: 5–10g sodium fluoride, or 32–64mg fluoride ions per kilogram of body mass, {{represents a}} lethal dose for adults. One-fifth of the lethal dose can cause adverse health effects, and chronic excess consumption {{may lead to}} skeletal fluorosis, which affects millions in Asia and Africa. Ingested fluoride forms <b>hydrofluoric</b> acid in the stomach which is easily absorbed by the intestines, where it crosses cell membranes, binds with calcium and interferes with various enzymes, before urinary excretion. Exposure limits are determined by urine testing of the body's ability to clear fluoride ions.|$|E
5|$|Tantalum is dark (blue-gray), dense, ductile, very hard, easily fabricated, {{and highly}} {{conductive}} {{of heat and}} electricity. The metal is renowned for its resistance to corrosion by acids; in fact, at temperatures below 150°C tantalum is almost completely immune to attack by the normally aggressive aqua regia. It can be dissolved with <b>hydrofluoric</b> acid or acidic solutions containing the fluoride ion and sulfur trioxide, {{as well as with}} a solution of potassium hydroxide. Tantalum's high melting point of 3017°C (boiling point 5458°C) is exceeded among the elements only by tungsten, rhenium and osmium for metals, and carbon.|$|E
5|$|Tantalum is inert against most acids except <b>hydrofluoric</b> {{acid and}} hot sulfuric acid, and hot {{alkaline}} solutions also cause tantalum to corrode. This property {{makes it a}} useful metal for chemical reaction vessels and pipes for corrosive liquids. Heat exchanging coils for the steam heating of hydrochloric acid are made from tantalum. Tantalum was extensively used {{in the production of}} ultra high frequency electron tubes for radio transmitters. The tantalum is capable of capturing oxygen and nitrogen by forming nitrides and oxides and therefore helps to sustain the high vacuum needed for the tubes.|$|E
5|$|All four thorium tetrahalides are known, as {{are some}} low-valent {{bromides}} and iodides: the tetrahalides are all 8-coordinated hygroscopic compounds that dissolve easily in polar solvents such as water. Many related polyhalide ions are also known. Thorium tetrafluoride has a monoclinic crystal structure {{like those of}} zirconium tetrafluoride and hafnium tetrafluoride, where the Th4+ ions are coordinated with F− ions in somewhat distorted square antiprisms. The other tetrahalides instead have dodecahedral geometry. Lower iodides ThI3 (black) and ThI2 (gold) can also be prepared by reducing the tetraiodide with thorium metal: they do not contain Th(III) and Th(II), but instead contain Th4+ and could be more clearly formulated as electride compounds. Many polynary halides with the alkali metals, barium, thallium, and ammonium are known for thorium fluorides, chlorides, and bromides. For example, when treated with potassium fluoride and <b>hydrofluoric</b> acid, Th4+ forms the complex anion , which precipitates as an insoluble salt, K2ThF6.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} iron alloys, around 3kg (6.5lb) metspar {{is added to}} each metric ton of steel; the {{fluoride}} ions lower its melting point and viscosity. Alongside its role as an additive in materials like enamels and welding rod coats, most acidspar is reacted with sulfuric acid to form <b>hydrofluoric</b> acid, which is used in steel pickling, glass etching and alkane cracking. One-third of HF goes into synthesizing cryolite and aluminium trifluoride, both fluxes in the Hall–Héroult process for aluminium extraction; replenishment is necessitated by their occasional reactions with the smelting apparatus. Each metric ton of aluminium requires about 23kg (51lb) of flux. Fluorosilicates consume the second largest portion, with sodium fluorosilicate used in water fluoridation and laundry effluent treatment, and as an intermediate en route to cryolite and silicon tetrafluoride. Other important inorganic fluorides include those of cobalt, nickel, and ammonium.|$|E
5|$|Exposure may not {{be evident}} for eight hours for 50% HF, rising to 24 hours for lower concentrations, and a burn may {{initially}} be painless as hydrogen fluoride affects nerve function. If skin has been exposed to HF, damage can be reduced by rinsing it under a jet of water for 10–15 minutes and removing contaminated clothing. Calcium gluconate is often applied next, providing calcium ions to bind with fluoride; skin burns can be treated with 2.5% calcium gluconate gel or special rinsing solutions. <b>Hydrofluoric</b> acid absorption requires further medical treatment; calcium gluconate may be injected or administered intravenously. Using calcium chloride – a common laboratory reagent – in lieu of calcium gluconate is contraindicated, and may lead to severe complications. Excision or amputation of affected parts may be required.|$|E
5|$|In 1868, Janssen and Lockyer {{independently}} {{observed a}} yellow {{line in the}} solar spectrum that did not match {{that of any other}} element. In 1895, in each case at around the same time, Ramsay, Cleve, and Langlet independently observed helium trapped in cleveite. André-Marie Ampère predicted an element analogous to chlorine obtainable from <b>hydrofluoric</b> acid, and between 1812 and 1886 many researchers tried to obtain it. Fluorine was eventually isolated by Moissan, in 1886. In 1894, Lord Rayleigh and Ramsay discovered argon by comparing the molecular weights of nitrogen prepared by liquefaction from air and nitrogen prepared by chemical means. It was the first noble gas to be isolated. In 1898, within a period of three weeks, Ramsay and Travers successively separated krypton, neon and xenon from liquid argon by their differences in boiling points. In 1898, Dorn discovered a radioactive gas resulting from the radioactive decay of radium; Ramsay and Robert Whytlaw-Gray subsequently isolated radon in 1910.|$|E
5|$|More complex {{protactinium}} fluorides {{are also}} known such as Pa2F9 and ternary fluorides {{of the types}} MPaF6 (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs or NH4), M2PaF7 (M = K, Rb, Cs or NH4) and M3PaF8 (M = Li, Na, Rb, Cs), all being white crystalline solids. The MPaF6 formula can be represented as a combination of MF and PaF5. These compounds {{can be obtained by}} evaporating a <b>hydrofluoric</b> acid solution containing these both complexes. For the small alkali cations like Na, the crystal structure is tetragonal, whereas it lowers to orthorphombic for larger cations K+, Rb+, Cs+ or NH4+. A similar variation was observed for the M2PaF7 fluorides, namely the crystal symmetry was dependent on the cation and differed for Cs2PaF7 and M2PaF7 (M = K, Rb or NH4).|$|E
5|$|Protactinium oxides are basic; they easily {{convert to}} {{hydroxides}} and can form various salts, such as sulfates, phosphates, nitrates, etc. The nitrate is usually white {{but can be}} brown due to radiolytic decomposition. Heating the nitrate in air at 400°C converts it to the white protactinium pentoxide. The polytrioxophosphate Pa(PO3)4 can be produced by reacting difluoride sulfate PaF2SO4 with phosphoric acid (H3PO4) under inert gas atmosphere. Heating the product to about 900°C eliminates the reaction by-products such as <b>hydrofluoric</b> acid, sulfur trioxide and phosphoric anhydride. Heating to higher temperatures in an inert atmosphere decomposes Pa(PO3)4 into the diphosphate PaP2O7, which is analogous to diphosphates of other actinides. In the diphosphate, the PO3 groups form pyramids of C2v symmetry. Heating PaP2O7 in air to 1400°C decomposes it into the pentoxides of phosphorus and protactinium.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium oxides {{are known}} for the metal {{oxidation}} states +2, +4 and +5. The most stable is white pentoxide Pa2O5, which can be produced by igniting protactinium(V) hydroxide in air at a temperature of 500°C. Its crystal structure is cubic, and the chemical composition is often non-stoichiometric, described as PaO2.25. Another phase of this oxide with orthorhombic symmetry has also been reported. The black dioxide PaO2 is obtained from the pentoxide by reducing it at 1550°C with hydrogen. It is not readily soluble in either dilute or concentrated nitric, hydrochloric or sulfuric acids, but easily dissolves in <b>hydrofluoric</b> acid. The dioxide can be converted back to pentoxide by heating in oxygen-containing atmosphere to 1100°C. The monoxide PaO has only been observed as a thin coating on protactinium metal, but not in an isolated bulk form.|$|E
25|$|Deprotection: Hydrolysis using <b>hydrofluoric</b> acid, {{pyridine}} and tetrahydrofuran.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{reactions}} {{occur with}} oxalic acid, <b>hydrofluoric</b> acid, and phosphoric acid.|$|E
25|$|Boric acid {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used substances that can neutralize active <b>hydrofluoric</b> acid (HF). It works by forcing the free F− anions into complex salts. This process defeats the extreme toxicity of <b>hydrofluoric</b> acid, particularly its ability to sequester ionic calcium from blood serum which can lead to cardiac arrest and bone decomposition; such an event can occur from just minor skin contact with HF.|$|E
25|$|An Alkylation unit {{is one of}} the {{conversion}} processes used in petroleum refineries. It is used to convert isobutane and low-molecular-weight alkenes (primarily a mixture of propene and butene) into alkylate, a high octane gasoline component. The process occurs {{in the presence of a}} strong acting acid such as sulfuric acid or <b>hydrofluoric</b> acid (HF) as catalyst. Depending on the acid used, the unit takes the name of SAAU (Sulphuric Acid Alkylation Unit) or HFAU (<b>Hydrofluoric</b> Acid Alkylation Unit).|$|E
25|$|Tungsten hexafluoride is an {{extremely}} corrosive compound that attacks any tissue. Exposure of humans to the gas first affects the eyes and respiratory tracts causing irritation, loss of vision, cough, and excessive formation of saliva and sputum. Upon mixing with the body fluids, the gas transforms into <b>hydrofluoric</b> acid which burns the skin and mucous tissues of the respiratory tract. Upon prolonged exposure, this results in pneumonitis and pulmonary edema, and could be fatal. Because {{of the formation of}} <b>hydrofluoric</b> acid upon reaction of WF6 with humidity, WF6 storage vessels have Teflon gaskets.|$|E
25|$|PFOA has {{two main}} {{synthesis}} routes, electrochemical fluorination (ECF) and telomerization. The equation below represents the ECF route with <b>hydrofluoric</b> acid reacting with octanoyl chloride, octanoyl chloride.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} use of <b>hydrofluoric</b> acid is in organofluorine chemistry. Many organofluorine compounds {{are prepared}} using HF as the fluorine source, including Teflon, fluoropolymers, fluorocarbons, and refrigerants such as freon.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen {{fluoride}} is {{a highly}} dangerous gas, forming corrosive and penetrating <b>hydrofluoric</b> acid upon contact with moisture. The gas can also cause blindness by rapid destruction of the corneas.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydrofluoric</b> acid has {{a variety}} of uses in {{industry}} and research. It is used as a starting material or intermediate in industrial chemistry, mining, refining, glass finishing, silicon chip manufacturing, and in cleaning.|$|E
25|$|In 1810, French {{physicist}} André-Marie Ampère {{suggested that}} <b>hydrofluoric</b> acid was {{a compound of}} hydrogen with an unknown element, analogous to chlorine. Fluorite was then shown to be mostly composed of calcium fluoride.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydrofluoric</b> acid is {{also used}} by some {{collectors}} of antique glass bottles to remove so-called 'sickness' from the glass, caused by acids (usually in the soil the bottle was buried in) attacking the soda content of the glass.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen {{fluoride}} {{is produced}} {{by the action of}} sulfuric acid on pure grades of the mineral fluorite and also as a side-product of the extraction of the fertilizer precursor phosphoric acid from various minerals. See also <b>hydrofluoric</b> acid.|$|E
25|$|French chemist Edmond Frémy (1814–1894) is {{credited}} with discovering anhydrous hydrogen fluoride while trying to isolate fluorine. Although Carl Wilhelm Scheele prepared <b>hydrofluoric</b> acid in large quantities in 1771, this acid was known in the glass industry before then.|$|E
25|$|Diluted <b>hydrofluoric</b> acid (1 to 3 %wt.) {{is used in}} the {{petroleum}} industry in a mixture with other acids (HCl or organic acids) in order to stimulate the production of water, oil, and gas wells specifically where sandstone is involved.|$|E
25|$|Aluminium oxide is an {{amphoteric}} substance, {{meaning it}} can react with both acids and bases, such as <b>hydrofluoric</b> acid and sodium hydroxide, acting as an acid with a base and a base with an acid, neutralising {{the other and}} producing a salt.|$|E
25|$|Many polynary halides {{with the}} alkali metals, barium, thallium, and {{ammonium}} {{are known for}} thorium fluorides, chlorides, and bromides. For example, when treated with potassium fluoride and <b>hydrofluoric</b> acid, Th4+ forms the complex anion , which precipitates as an insoluble salt, K2ThF6.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{contact with}} moisture, {{including}} tissue, hydrogen fluoride immediately converts to <b>hydrofluoric</b> acid, which is highly corrosive and toxic, and requires immediate medical attention upon exposure. Breathing in hydrogen fluoride {{at high levels}} or in combination with skin contact can cause death from an irregular heartbeat or from fluid buildup in the lungs.|$|E
