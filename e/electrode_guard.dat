40|$|This {{research}} {{has made a}} comparative investigated of crosstalk in backside illuminated and frontside illuminated single junction photodiode and vertical double junction photodiode CMOS compatible pixels, using a commercial 2 D device simulation package, SEMICAD DEVICE (1994). Comparison of pixel total, electron and hole quantum efficiency response and Absorption Volume data is undertaken. This is so that the underlying carrier drift-diffusion dynamics responsible for optimal pixel response resolution may be qualitatively understood, allowing prediction of even more optimal photodiode pixel configurations. The effect of varying the double junction and single junction photodiode pixel 2 ̆ 7 s geometry on response resolution is considered. Only for the former {{is the effect of}} doping, biasing and introducing highly doped pixel boundary trenches on response resolution undertaken. Additionally, for the former pixel, the effect of introducing a guard-ring electrode on its electrical response resolution is investigated. For single junction photodiode pixels, the boundary trench isolation, a highly doped recombination boundary trench placed either side of each pixel 2 ̆ 7 s well, showed considerably less pixel response resolution and hence more crosstalk than using the guard-ring electrode configuration. However the boundary-trench-isolation-pixel 2 ̆ 7 s response was an improvement on the unguarded single junction photodiode pixel 2 ̆ 7 s response. The outer junction of the double junction photodiode pixel acts {{in the same way as}} the guard-ring electrode for the single junction photodiode pixel, by suppressing the pixel response away from the pixel centre. However for pixels with similar geometry of outer well and substrate to the single junction photodiode guarded pixel, the outer junction 2 ̆ 2 guard 2 ̆ 2 improves the pixel response resolution more than the <b>electrode</b> <b>guard</b> does. However for shallow pixels their response resolutions are not significantly different, in that response outside the 2 ̆ 2 well 2 ̆ 2 (outer well in double junction photodiode pixels) is insignificant. The response resolution is more flexibly varied inside this 2 ̆ 2 well 2 ̆ 2 for the double junction than for the guarded single junction photodiode pixel. Generally the frontside illuminated photodiode pixels have better response resolution and hence crosstalk suppression than the same pixel backside illuminated. This is due primarily to their greater depletion region absorption volume proportion. This results from the closer proximity of their photogenerated carrier-envelope to their pixel 2 ̆ 7 s depletion region. However as frontside and backside illuminated pixel absorption volume proportions converge, their response resolution becomes less distinguishable. The predictive advantage of pixel absorption volume data for optimal pixel response resolution is evident. Such data can help to narrow the selection of possible optimal pixel configurations. However simulation is still the necessary final arbiter without the more costly fabricated-device testing option available...|$|E

The cell equipped with two concentric <b>guarded</b> <b>electrodes</b> {{is able to}} eliminate the error due to dimensional change of specimen in the permittivity measurement and to measure the specimen thickness simultaneously. The accuracy of permittivity depends mainly on the flatness of the four concentric electrodes, which are consisted of those two <b>guarded</b> <b>electrodes</b> and their <b>guard</b> <b>electrodes.</b> The temperature range, in which the flatness of surface of the four concen-tric electrodes was ensured, was widely extended by an improved design of the cell. The cell is usable to measure a very low dielectric loss owing to the three-terminal configuration for each guard-ed electrode. The performance of the cell was tested by measuring the dielectric and dilatometric properties of undecanoic, tridecanoic, and pentadecanoic acids. These acids show a cosiderable change of their lattice spacings at the transition temperature and show an extremely low dielectric loss near 200 K.

There are various electrode systems provided by the current IEC and ASTM standard. In this paper, influence from the shape of a circular metallic <b>electrode</b> with <b>guard</b> ring, which is very common in DC conductivity measurement for its simple structure, is investigated. Mineral oil with different aging times are tested using this electrode system. According to IEC and ASTM standard, there are four parameters of this electrode system that can affect the DC conductivity measurement, distance between two <b>electrodes,</b> distance between <b>guard</b> and <b>guarded</b> <b>electrode,</b> outer radius of the guard ring and the outer radius of the <b>guarded</b> <b>electrode.</b> Here, we are going to add a new parameter, the edge radius to the system, which is not mentioned in current standards but is quite important in liquid dielectrics measurement.

The distribution of electric strength of this electrode system is simulated by Comsol Multiphysics. As seen from the simulating result, there would be a point that has much higher electric strength {{near the edge of the}} <b>guard</b> and <b>guarded</b> <b>electrode.</b> If the edges of these two electrodes are very sharp, the maximum electric strength in the test cell will increase.

The model includes typical elements of modern double-probe sensors on, e. g., BepiColombo/MMO, Cluster, and THEMIS spacecraft, such as a conducting boom and a preamplifier housing called a puck. The puck is also used for the <b>guard</b> <b>electrode,</b> and its potential is negatively biased by reference to the floating spacecraft potential. We apply the proposed model {{to an analysis of}} an equilibrium plasma environment around the sensor by assuming that the sun illuminates the spacecraft from the direction perpendicular to the sensor deployment axis. As a simulation result, it is confirmed that a substantial number of spacecraft-originating photoelectrons are once emitted sunward and then fall onto the puck and sensing element positions. In order to effectively repel such photoelectrons coming from the sun direction, a potential hump for electrons, i. e., a negative potential region, should be created in a plasma region around the sunlit side of the <b>guard</b> <b>electrode</b> surface. The simulation results reveal the significance of the <b>guard</b> <b>electrode</b> potential being not only lower than the spacecraft body but also lower than the background plasma potential of the region surrounding the puck and the sensing element.

In this paper, the electric field distribution of an electrode system which consists of two parallel circular metallic <b>electrodes</b> and a <b>guard</b> <b>electrode</b> has been studied using Comsol Multiphysics software. A new parameter, which is not yet involved in current standards, the edge radius, has been mentioned in the literature formerly and is currently discussed in a CIGRE working group. In this paper, the influence of this parameter has been investigated by means of field calculation. As seen from the simulating result, there are regions {{in the vicinity of}} the edges of the <b>guard</b> and measuring <b>electrode</b> that are under high electric field. If the edges of these two electrodes are sharp, the maximum electric field in the test cell will be much higher than the average field between the measuring electrode and the high voltage electrode.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development and}} characterization of a novel NDE methodthe Capacitive Imaging (CI) technique. The CI technique employs a pair of (or multiple) electrodes to form a co-planar capacitor, and uses the fringing quasi-static electric field established across the electrodes to investigate specimens of interest. In general, the CI probe is sensitive to surface and hidden defects in insulating materials, and surface features on conducting materials. The CI technique is advantageous for its non-contact and non-invasive nature, and the capacitive coupling allows the CI technique {{to work on a}} wide variety of material properties. The theoretical background to the CI technique has been developed. It is shown that in the frequency range of operation (10 kHz to 1 MHz), the quasi-static approximation is valid and the Maxwell’s Equations describing the general electromagnetic phenomena can be simplified. The practical implementation of the CI system is based on this analysis, and it is shown that the CI technique has features that can complement techniques such as eddy current methods that are already established in NDE. The design principles of the CI probes that are required for an optimum imaging performance have been determined, by considering the key measures of the performance including the depth of penetration, the measurement sensitivity, the imaging resolution and the signal to noise ratio (SNR). It has been shown that the operation frequency is not an influential factor - the performance of the CI probe is determined primarily by the geometry of the probe (e. g. size/shape of the electrodes, separation between <b>electrodes,</b> <b>guard</b> <b>electrodes</b> etc.). Symmetric CI probes with triangular-shaped electrodes were identified as a good general purpose design. Finite Element (FE) models were constructed both in 2 D and 3 D in COMSOLTM to predict the electric field distributions from CI probes. Effects of thickness of specimen, liftoff distance and relative permittivity value etc were examined using the 2 D models. The sensitivity distributions of different CI probes were obtained from the 3 D models and were used to characterize the imaging ability of the given CI probes. The fundamental concepts of the CI technique have been experimentally validated in a series of scans where the defects were successfully imaged in insulating (Perspex) and conducting (e. g. Aluminium, Steel and carbon fibre composite) specimens. The detection of corrosion under insulation (CUI) has also been demonstrated. The imaging abilities were assessed by investigating various standard specimens under different situations. The CI technique was then successfully applied to various practical specimens, including glass fibre laminated composites and sandwich structures, laminated carbon fibre composites, corroded steel plate and pipe, and concrete specimens. Further measurements were also conducted using modified CI probes, to demonstrate the wide range of applications of the CI technique. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceUniversity of Warwick.

Basic test methods such as dielectric spectroscopy and polarization and depolarization measurement have already been used to test mineral oil and pressboard conductivity. However, the knowledge about the mechanism of electrical conduction ininsulating oil and pressboard is still limited. Therefore, the goal of this thesis is {{to gain a better understanding}} of the mechanism of electrical conduction in mineral oil and oil impregnated pressboard. Polarization and depolarization current method (PDC) has gained huge popularity for insulation diagnosis. This time-dependent measurement may provide sufficient information about the dielectric properties of mineral oil and its electrical performance. Here, the dielectric characteristics of three types of mineral oils with different ageing times have been studied using the PDC method. A new polarization theory involving two kinds of charge carriers have been proposed to explain the dielectric behaviour observed in our measurements. Dielectric spectroscopy is a powerful tool to study dipole relaxation, electrical conduction and structure of molecules. Electrode polarization, as a parasitic effect due to the blocking of charge carriers in the vicinity of an electrode, can make the frequency response at low frequency difficult to understand. Since charge carriers in mineral oil are not only generated from dissociation but also from injection at electrodes, the current induced by the motion of the injected charge carriers should also be taken into consideration. The polarization caused by the injection current has been studied in this thesis. When the electric field is not intense, the injection current is proportional to the field and only contributes to the imaginary part of the complex permittivity. A new computer based calculation method and a modified space charge polarization theory have been proposed with this injection current being involved. The frequency responses of three different kinds of mineral oils have been measured and the experimental results have been compared with the simulation using the modified model. It seems the density of the injected charge carriers increases with the aging period. This new model enables one to gain a better understanding of electrical conduction in mineral oil. The design and choice of an electrode system is important in DC conductivity measurement of insulating liquid. In this thesis, the electric field distribution of an electrode system which consists of two parallel circular metallic <b>electrodes</b> and a <b>guard</b> <b>electrode</b> has been studied using Comsol Multiphysics software. A new parameter which is not yet involved in current standards, the edge radius, has been investigated by means of field calculation. It has been found out that there are regions in the vicinity of the edges of the <b>guard</b> and measuring <b>electrode</b> at which the field is dramatically distorted. If the edges of these two electrodes are sharp, the maximum electric field in the test cell will be much higher than the average field between the measuring electrode and the high voltage electrode. An empirical equation has been proposed to calculate this maximum field. The classic correction expression of effective radius has been re-evaluated with the edge radius being taken into account. Experimental work has been performed to confirm this conclusion. Three kinds of mineral oils with different aging times have been tested under the DC field using a <b>guarded</b> <b>electrode</b> system and the electric strengths of these oils have been estimated. A recommendation has been made to current standards in insulating liquid measurement. The dielectric properties of the oil impregnated pressboard sample have been evaluated with the PDC measurement under different temperatures and electric fields. The classic R-C equivalent model has used to explain the dielectric behaviour of the oil/pressboard sample in our PDC measurement. As the electrode effect should be taken into consideration in a DC field, a modified R-C equivalent model has been proposed and used to fit the experimental results and good fitting has been obtained...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Multiphase flows are {{increasingly}} {{found in many}} parts of the petroleum industry, from reservoir to downstream processing plant. Multiphase flows such as oil-gas, oil-water, gas-water and oil-water-gas are commonly encountered. The accuracy of most multiphase flowmeter highly depended on the flow regime of the mixture being metered. Flow regimes in multiphase flow are often unpredictable which makes the calibration of most multiphase flowmeters is flow regime dependent. As the capabilities of multiphase flowmeters increases, the problems of how to validate the performance of such instruments increases. This paper investigate and optimise a sensing technique that can be used for in-situ validation of multiphase flow measurement. To date, several flow measurement techniques were available with different feature and for different applications. Capacitance sensor relatively has fast response, low cost and easy to construct, which explain its wide use in industrial applications. Ways in which number of parameters effects the sensitivity of the capacitance sensor were investigated. This includes capacitance sensor geometry (electrode length and electrode separation), pipe material and thickness. The effect of fluid conductivity and <b>guard</b> <b>electrodes</b> on sensor performance was also investigated. ANSYS finite element software package was used to model a three-phase flow regime with capacitance electrodes and its sensitivity for carrier and phase detection in multiphase flow. Results obtained by the finite element simulation compared favourably with experimental results. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{photoelectron}} {{spectra of}} volatile liquids with corresponding vapor pressures {{up to several}} 10 torrs are measured in a liquid jet vacuum experiment for the first time. Reduction of the typical spatial dimension of the fast flowing jet to a diameter smaller than the mean free path of the evaporating molecules prepares a free, continuously replaced and uncontamined surface. 10 and 20 micron jets are used in a vacuum of 10 "-" 6 mbar. Electrokinetic charging at the nozzle causes an additional electric potential at the jet surface of several volts. It is shown that the effect can be stabilized by a <b>guard</b> <b>electrode</b> and can be controlled by changing the pH-value of the liquid, the temperature and/or the nozzle pressure. The photoelectron spectra of pure liquid, six simple alcohols, formamide and nonane are presented. A simplified 'Born-'picture of the solvation gives a first estimate for the phase transition shifts of individual ionisation potentials of molecular orbitals. The influence of several experimental parameters is discussed. The escape depth of the generated photoelectrons is {{in the order of}} a few aangstroems so the experiment gives informations only about the surface. Two binary mixtures, which are solvable by any amount in each other, are studied. (orig.)

40|$|Microelectronic vision {{prostheses}} aim {{to restore}} visual percepts through electrical {{stimulation of the}} surviving visual pathways in the blind. Electrical stimulation {{has been shown to}} produce spots of light in the visual field. A neurostimulator that forms the basis of a vision prosthesis was designed using a high voltage CMOS process to allow it to be able to stimulate when faced with high electrode-tissue impedances. It was implemented with novel features that allow it to be scalable, and to focus charge injection, and can stimulate multiple sites simultaneously using a current source and sink at each site. To reduce electrical cross-talk between multiple stimulation sites, six-return electrodes surround each stimulating <b>electrode,</b> electrically <b>guarding</b> them from each other. The six-return electrode configuration was shown to reduce electrical cross-talk in saline bath tests compared to single-return electrode configurations. The neurostimulator was used to evoke responses from cats through electrical stimulation via intravitreal ball electrodes, corneal electrodes, and planar electrode arrays in the suprachoroidal space. Responses were measured on the visual cortex through optical imaging of intrinsic signals, and through surface electrodes. Using the planar electrode array in the suprachoroidal space, responses were elicited to biphasic, bipolar and monopolar stimuli, with each stimulating electrode coupled with either six-return electrodes, two-return electrodes, or a single-return electrode. The average charge threshold to elicit a response for biphasic, bipolar stimulation with six-return electrodes was 76. 47 ± 8. 76 nC (standard error of the mean). For biphasic, bipolar stimulation, the magnitude and area of cortical response with the six-return electrode configurations was on average 2. 18 ± 0. 19 times smaller than single-return electrode configurations, and 1. 89 &# 65533;&# 65533; 0. 19 times smaller than two-return electrode configurations (P < 0. 0001). It was also found that for biphasic stimulation, a greater magnitude and area of response was elicited for monopolar stimulation compared to bipolar stimulation. This dissertation details the design and testing of a novel, scalable neurostimulator to focus charge injection. It also shows that suprachoroidal, bipolar stimulation can elicit visual responses, and that the area of cortical activation was more focused when using bipolar, biphasic stimulation, and six-return electrodes...|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{precision}} and accuracy of in situ Nd isotope analyses in geological samples, high analytical sensitivity and minimized non-linear mass dependent fractionation are desirable. In this study, we investigated the effects of three different cone combinations {{and the addition of}} N 2 with the <b>guard</b> <b>electrode,</b> either grounded or floating, on the performance of Nd isotope analyses. Signal enhancements (2. 5 - 3 folds) were observed for the Jet sample cone + X skimmer cone and for the standard sample cone + X skimmer cone, which were compared to those of the standard sample cone + H skimmer cone with the addition of N 2 at 3 or 6 ml min- 1. The influence of a <b>guard</b> <b>electrode</b> on the LA-MC-ICP-MS sensitivity was minimal for dry plasma conditions but became significant in the presence of N 2. The addition of 3 or 6 ml min- 1 N 2 into the carrier gas increased the sensitivity for Nd by a factor of 1. 6 with the GE-on mode for the Jet sample cone + X skimmer cone. However, in the GE-off mode, the addition of 2 - 3 ml min- 1 N 2 decreased the signal intensity of Nd by a factor of two to three. The makeup gas flow rate was found to {{have a significant effect on}} the mass bias stability of Nd isotopes, and this effect was different for different cone combinations. To stabilize the mass bias, measurements at elevated makeup gas flow rates was required for the combination of the X skimmer cone with the standard sample cone or Jet sample cone, at the expense of sensitivity. In notable contrast, the mass bias was stable for the combination of the standard sample cone and H skimmer cone under their corresponding optimum makeup gas flow rates. However, we found that the neodymium isotopes exhibited a large non-linear component at elevated makeup gas flow rates that could not be corrected by the accepted mass fractionation laws. The addition of 3 - 6 ml min- 1 nitrogen to the central gas flow in laser ablation MC-ICP-MS was found to not only significantly enlarge the mass bias stability zone, but also to suppress the non-linear mass dependent fractionation for the combination of X skimmer cone with Jet sample cone or standard sample cone. The accuracy and precision of the developed analytical method for Nd isotope using Jet sample cone + X skimmer cone with the addition of nitrogen has been demonstrated by analyzing a series of reference glasses (JNdi- 1 glass, LREE glass, NIST 610) and minerals (apatite, monazite and titanite). Results obtained for 143 Nd/ 144 Nd ratios in these reference materials are in excellent agreement with published values, demonstrating the capability of the developed analytical method to be an important tool for providing high-quality in situ Nd isotope data in geological samples.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for the simultaneous measurement {{of changes in}} membrane current and unidirectional radiotracer flux in internally dialyzed voltage-clamped squid giant axons. The small currents that are produced by electrogenic transport processes or steady-state ionic currents can be resolved using this method. Because the use of grounded <b>guard</b> <b>electrodes</b> in the end pools is not, by itself, an adequate means of eliminating end-effects, two ancillary end pool clamp circuits are described to eliminate extraneous current flow from {{the ends of the}} axon. The end pool voltage-clamp circuits serve to minimize net current flow between the end pools and center pool, and employ stable, low-impedance calomel electrodes to monitor the potentials of the end and center pools. The adequacy of the method is demonstrated by experiments in which unidirectional 22 Na efflux and current, flowing through tetrodotoxin (TTX) -sensitive Na channels into Na-free seawater, under K-free conditions, are shown to be equal. The equality of unidirectional TTX-sensitive flux and current is maintained over the entire range of membrane potentials examined (- 60 to + 20 mV). The method has been applied to a series of experiments in which the voltage dependence and stoichiometry of the Na/K pump have been measured (Rakowski et al., 1989), and can be applied in general to the simultaneous measurement of changes in current and flux of other electrogenic transport processes, and of currents through ionic channels that open under steady-state conditions...|$|R
