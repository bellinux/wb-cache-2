2500|$|On June21, Bradley {{discovered}} that a flaw in his software misread the <b>forensic</b> <b>data</b> and that the word [...] "chloroform" [...] had been searched for only one time and the website in question offered information {{on the use of}} chloroform in the 19th century. On June 23, Baez called Cindy Anthony to the stand, who told jurors she had been the one who performed the [...] "chloroform" [...] search on the family computer in March 2008. The prosecution alleged that only Casey Anthony could have conducted this search and the others because {{she was the only one}} home at the time. When asked by prosecutors how she could have made the Internet searches when employment records show she was at work, Cindy Anthony said despite what her work time sheet indicates, she was at home during these time periods because she left from work early during the days in question. Bradley alerted prosecutor Linda Burdick and Sgt. Kevin Stenger of the Sheriff's Office the weekend of June 25 about the discrepancy in his software, and volunteered to fly to Orlando at his own expense to show them. On the same day, the judge temporarily halted proceedings when the defense filed a motion to determine if Anthony was competent to proceed with trial. The motion states the defense received a privileged communication from their client which caused them to believe [...] "...Ms. Anthony is not competent to aid and assist in her own defense". The trial resumed on June27 when the judge announced that the results of the psychological evaluations showed Anthony was competent to proceed. Later, in testimony about air samples, Dr. Ken Furton, a professor of chemistry at Florida International University, stated that there is no consensus in the field on what chemicals are typical of human decomposition. Judge Perry ruled that the jury would not get to smell air samples taken from the trunk.|$|E

40|$|Forensic DNA {{profiles}} of short tandem repeat (STR) loci are currently obtained using PCR followed by capillary electrophoresis (CE). Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) technologies do {{not rely on}} size separation and thus relieve the limitations on locus multiplexy. Deep sequencing with MPS creates possibilities within forensics for analyzing degraded samples and mixed samples. Furthermore, in the same analysis single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers can be included, which can generate phenotypic or ancestry leads for <b>forensic</b> investigators. <b>Data</b> analysis of raw sequencer reads, resulting in a reliable and usable forensic human identification report is still in early development. The aim of the doctoral research {{was to develop a}} program for <b>forensic</b> DNA <b>data</b> analysis. The main results are the data analysis framework MyFLq (My Forensic Loci queries) and nomenclature service FLAD (Forensic Loci Allele Database).

40|$|The {{challenge}} of achieving situational understanding is a limiting factor in effective, timely, and adaptive cyber-security analysis. Anomaly detection fills {{a critical role}} in network assessment and trend analysis, both of which underlie the establishment of comprehensive situational understanding. To that end, we propose a cyber security data warehouse implemented as a hierarchical graph of aggregations that captures anomalies at multiple scales. Each node of our proposed graph is a summarization table of cyber event aggregations, and the edges are aggregation operators. The cyber security data warehouse enables domain experts to quickly traverse a multi-scale aggregation space systematically.
