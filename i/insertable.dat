25|$|The belt loops are of new design, {{much wider}} (double width) {{and there is}} 8 of them now {{compared}} to 7 in the past. The waist adjustment cord has been removed and replaced by the Velcro waistband fine-adjusters, one at each hip. Instead of a knee pocket which could only accommodate soft knee inserts in the past, the knee area now features multi-layered comprehensive design which allows external hard-type knee pads to be inserted and secured. Back of the knee area has Velcro hook and loop patches to further secure knee inserts around the knee area. Cuffs {{at the bottom of}} the trousers do not use drawstrings anymore for blousing; those have been again replaced by the Velcro cuff adjusters. Further changes as part of the transition to OCP removed the pockets for <b>insertable</b> knee pads altogether, along with the replacement of more Velcro with buttons.|$|E

60|$|And the ring-suffice it to {{say that}} her little finger was exactly <b>insertable</b> in a ten-cent piece from which {{everything}} had been removed but the milling: removed with infinite loving patience by Mr. Rossiter, and at the expense of much history and philosophy and other less important things, in his college bedroom at New Haven. Honora wore it for a whole week; a triumph indeed for Mr. Rossiter; when it was placed in a box in Honora's bedroom, which contained other gifts--not all from him--and many letters, in the writing of which learning had likewise suffered. The immediate cause of the putting away of this ring was said to be the renowned Clinton Howe, who was on the Harvard football eleven, and who visited Mr. George Hanbury that Easter. Fortunate indeed the tailor who was called upon to practise his art on an Adonis like Mr. Howe, and it was remarked that he scarcely left Honora's side at the garden party and dance which Mrs. Dwyer gave in honour of the returning heroes, on the Monday of Easter week.|$|E

50|$|Because of {{the limited}} radius of {{available}} space around the fully <b>insertable</b> lens, {{the use of the}} normal central shutter was impossible. Therefore, Waaske proposed a new type of shutter, which was separated into two functional parts. The shutter controlling clockworks were mounted unmovable in the camera body, while the shutter lamellas were mounted in the movable sliding tube. The separate parts were mechanically coupled by shafts. Only when the shutter was cocked and therefore the lamellas were uncoupled, the sliding tube could be inserted into the housing.|$|E

50|$|The <b>insertable</b> {{portion of}} a PICC varies from 25 to 60 cm in length, that being {{adequate}} to reach the desired tip position in most patients. Some lines {{are designed to be}} trimmed to the desired length before insertion; others are simply inserted to the needed depth with the excess left outside. As supplied, the line has a guide wire inside. This wire is provided to stiffen the (otherwise very flexible) line so it can be threaded through the veins. The wire is removed and discarded after insertion.|$|E
50|$|For {{people with}} more than two episodes of syncope and no {{diagnosis}} on “routine testing”, an <b>insertable</b> cardiac monitor might be used. It lasts 28-36 months. Smaller than a pack of gum, it is inserted just beneath the skin in the upper chest area. The procedure typically takes 15 to 20 minutes. Once inserted, the device continuously monitors the rate and rhythm of the heart. Upon waking from a “fainting” spell, the patient places a hand held pager-sized device called an Activator over the implanted device and simply presses a button. This information is stored and retrieved by their physician and some devices can be monitored remotely.|$|E
50|$|Lexington Medical Center has {{developed}} an advanced electrophysiology program to diagnose and treat patients with cardiac arrhythmias. In addition, the program has an experienced team of cardiologists that implant cardiac devices including pacemakers, defibrillators, and biventricular pacing systems. Lexington Medical Center has also begun to use <b>insertable</b> cardiac monitors, commonly known as loop recorders, to diagnose heart rhythm problems. These small devices, placed under the skin with a small surgical procedure, monitor heart rhythms around the clock. While versions of this technology have been available for years, new loop recorders are {{as small as a}} paper clip and require an incision of just a few millimeters.|$|E
5000|$|The TI-59 is {{an early}} {{programmable}} calculator, that was manufactured by Texas Instruments from 1977. It is the successor to the TI SR-52, quadrupling the number of [...] "program steps" [...] of storage, and adding [...] "ROM Program Modules" [...] (an <b>insertable</b> ROM chip, capable of holding 5000 program steps). Just like the SR-52, it has a magnetic card reader for external storage. One quarter of the memory is stored {{on each side of}} one card. It {{was one of the first}} LED calculators with the capability and flexibility to take on many real-world calculation challenges, and quickly became popular with professionals in many fields.|$|E
50|$|Fashionable {{reusable}} underwear {{alternatives to}} pads and diapers have emerged. Some {{of these new}} washable products still feature built-in absorbent pads or <b>insertable</b> disposable pads, {{but some of the}} players in the market offer consumers options which are increasingly like normal underwear. These companies have developed highly absorbent fabrics that combine several moisture-trapping fabric layers to achieve a similar absorbent result to traditional pads. This new-style incontinence underwear looks and feels like normal underwear so it can be washed and reused, whilst being discrete. This offers the user economic and environmental savings. The use of fabric textiles in these new incontinence products also means that it is now possible to make fashionable incontinence underwear.|$|E

50|$|In 1983, Dr. Stewart Reuter, Chair of Radiology at UTHSCSA and {{a mentor}} to Palmaz, {{encouraged}} him to accept a position at the center. Palmaz did so, in part because there he would have access to resources he needed to further his stent development. He eventually succeeded in creating a prototype of a stainless steel, <b>insertable</b> mesh stent that could be expanded once inside the body to hold a blood vessel or artery open and allow blood to flow more freely. He also secured funding from a somewhat unlikely partner: Phil Romano, an entrepreneur who founded restaurant chains such as Fuddruckers and The Macaroni Grill, offered to put up $250,000 {{in exchange for a}} stake in the product, which Palmaz began co-developing with Dr. Richard Schatz, a cardiologist at Brooke Army Medical Center.|$|E
50|$|The {{yield of}} a weapon can also be {{controlled}} by selecting among a choice of pits. For example, the Mark 4 nuclear bomb could be equipped with three different pits: 49-LTC-C (levitated uranium-235, tested in the Zebra test on 14 May 1948), 49-LCC-C (levitated composite uranium-plutonium), and 50-LCC-C (levitated composite). This approach is not suitable for field selectability of the yield of the more modern weapons with nonremovable pits, but allows production of multiple weapon subtypes with different yields for different tactical uses.The early US designs were based on standardized Type C and Type D pit assemblies. The Mark 4 bomb used the Type C and Type D pits, which were <b>insertable</b> manually in flight. The Mark 5 bomb used Type D pits, with automated in-flight insertion; the W-5 warhead used the same. Its successor, the Mark 6 bomb, presumably used the same or similar pits.|$|E
50|$|Ice play {{is a form}} of {{temperature}} play that usually involves running pieces of ice across a person's naked skin. In popular culture this form of cold temperature play is frequently shown as foreplay to suggest sex with a flair of kink/interest but which may not be classed as BDSM - see movies such as Do the Right Thing, and 9½ Weeks. In BDSM, it's not uncommon for ice play to be used more elaborately. Ice is sometimes used as an <b>insertable</b> (for the vagina, anus, and occasionally for the male urethra), but this is risky because ice, as it melts, can form edges sharp enough to cut skin or tender tissues. Part or all of the body may be immersed in ice or ice water for short periods of time (longer periods of time run the risk of hypothermia and frostbite). Ice may be used to provide contrast in a scene that also involves warm or hot stimuli.|$|E
50|$|The Lee-Metford rifle, {{developed}} in 1888, {{was one of}} the first rifles to use a detachable box magazine. However, the first completely modern removable box magazine was patented in 1908 by Arthur Savage for the Savage Model 99. Other guns did not adopt all of its features until his patent expired in 1942: It has shoulders to retain cartridges when it is removed from the rifle. It operates reliably with cartridges of different lengths. It is <b>insertable</b> and removable at any time with any number of cartridges. These features allow the operator to reload the gun infrequently, carry magazines rather than loose cartridges, and to easily change the types of cartridges in the field. The magazine is assembled from inexpensive stamped sheet metal. It also includes a crucial safety feature for hunting dangerous game: when empty the follower stops the bolt from engaging the chamber, informing the operator that the gun is empty before any attempt to fire.|$|E
50|$|The modern {{removable}} box magazine {{often seen}} on military rifles {{was invented in}} 1908 by Savage, as an improvement to the Model 99. It did not come into wide use until his patent expired in 1942 with the obvious exception {{of the family of}} rifles designed by James Paris Lee and adopted by the USN and the British Empire; first as the Lee-Metford and later as the Lee-Enfield rifles. The box magazine has many attractive features that ensured its eventual dominance: shoulders to retain cartridges when it is removed from the rifle, operates reliably with cartridges of different lengths and is <b>insertable</b> and removable at any time with any number of cartridges. This allows the operator to reload the gun infrequently, carry magazines rather than loose cartridges, and to easily change the types of cartridges.

5000|$|Kasten's {{paintings}} are predominantly acrylics on canvas, {{but he also}} works in watercolor and gouache. The graphics are primarily drawings in pencil, monoprints, drypoints and collagraphs. In the 1960s he began working in collography which is {{a variation of the}} etching process first practiced by Rudolph Nesch in the 1930s. Kasten's collographs are noteworthy for the sensitivity in texture and for the use of <b>insertable</b> parts such as coins and found objects to print a range of colors.In addition to his wide record of painting exhibitions, Karl Kasten is known worldwide as a master printer. In 1950, he established the Printmaking program and a course in Materials and Techniques at UC Berkeley. Kasten's aim and underlying credo with the courses was that printmaking could equal traditional painting through creative exploration. After viewing his colorful etchings of the 1950s, art critic Alfred Frankenstein observed that Kasten had [...] "discovered a new softness, liquidity, and fluency of effect in the bitten plate and with this a new way of expressing the modern artist's preoccupation with space and movement." [...] Susan Landauer recognized Kasten in her monograph Breaking Type: The Art of Karl Kasten, with one or two exceptions 'there were few examples of serious printmaking among Abstract Expressionists in New York.' Kasten has also been recognized for his printing accomplishments with the 1997 Distinguished Artist award of the California Society of Printmakers, the Humanities Research Fellowship and Tamarind Lithography Fellowship. David Acton refers to Kasten succinctly as [...] "the dean of Bay Area printmaking." ...|$|E
