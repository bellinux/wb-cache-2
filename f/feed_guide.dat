Numerical computations of the reflection coefficient, derived from the aperture admittance, are compared with both the experimental and theoretical results of a similar problem which is solved by application of the geometrical theory of diffraction.

The feeding recommendations vary considerably among them, depending on the source of data, methods of analysis of data, methods of presentation and purpose of the <b>feeding</b> <b>guide.</b> The majority of the guides are difficult {{to adapt to the}} various dairy farm conditions. This study was an attempt to prepare a <b>feeding</b> <b>guide</b> which would include some of the factors whose effect on milk production can be measured. Secondary sources of data were used as it was impossible to conduct a controlled experiment. The <b>feeding</b> <b>guide</b> was made into two parts. The first part consisted on the basic data which gave estimates of milk production from cows of 26 different productive capacities, fed medium quality roughage freely and grain rations ranging from no grain to levels where the last pound of grain resulted in the production of 0. 3 pound of milk. The marginal physical product ranging from 1. 00 to 0. 30 at different levels of grain feeding was calculated for each of the 26 cows at different productive capacities to allow dairymen to estimate the point where marginal cost is equal to marginal revenue. The second part of the <b>feeding</b> <b>guide,</b> made to fit over the first part, would allow estimates of milk production and the economic optimum level of feeding for factors that deviate from the basic part of the <b>feeding</b> <b>guide.</b> The features that can be considered in using the <b>feeding</b> <b>guide</b> are: Changes in the prices of hay, grain, and milk.

40|$|Background: Fussy {{eating in}} young {{children}} is very common, with at least 50 % of parents reporting having a fussy child. Eating behaviours established early in life tend to remain throughout childhood and into adulthood, so ensuring that children develop healthy eating behaviours from their earliest years is vital. Fussy children often refuse to eat healthy foods, like fruit and vegetables, but favour high-calorie foods instead. Diets low in fruit and vegetables {{have been linked to}} a number of preventable health conditions, such as diabetes and cancers, as well as to overweight and obesity. Fussy child eating behaviours can also cause anxiety and stress in caregivers, which can perpetuate the problem. Despite an abundance of available support for introducing complementary foods, practical advice about child feeding once weaning has occurred is lacking. Moreover, caregivers find available resources about feeding young children and promoting healthy eating to be “too basic” and have called for evidence-based, credible resources to help them manage children’s difficult or fussy eating behaviours. Empowering caregivers to effectively manage fussy eating behaviours and improve health in their children will likely prevent these eating behaviours from becoming engrained and reduce the number of children eating unhealthy or limited diets. Aim: To address the lack of child feeding support for caregivers by developing an evidence-based, credible and accessible support resource to promote healthy eating habits {{in young children}} and healthy feeding practices in caregivers. Method: Following {{a review of the literature}} and consultation with caregivers, the Child <b>Feeding</b> <b>Guide</b> was developed. The Child <b>Feeding</b> <b>Guide</b> is a website and free mobile app which offers information, advice and tools to help caregivers manage fussy eating behaviours. An online format was used to ensure the Child <b>Feeding</b> <b>Guide</b> is accessible and that a diverse range of caregivers can benefit from it. Health professionals and caregivers with young children were asked to use the newly-developed Child <b>Feeding</b> <b>Guide</b> and provide feedback on its usability, content, appearance and novelty. Results: Over 85 % of health professionals agreed that the Child <b>Feeding</b> <b>Guide</b> contains useful information, is a beneficial resource, and is easy to use. 95 % would recommend it to the families that they work with. 80 % of caregivers reported that using it helped them to better understand their children’s eating behaviour. Caregivers commented that using the Child <b>Feeding</b> <b>Guide</b> had made them aware of how their feeding behaviours can inadvertently affect their child. Other features of the Child <b>Feeding</b> <b>Guide</b> were identified as beneficial, such as: the provision of advice alongside practical and realistic methods for improving mealtimes; tips for not using food for rewards or for comfort; information on common feeding pitfalls. Caregivers also reported finding the Child <b>Feeding</b> <b>Guide</b> novel, interesting and educational, and easy to use. Conclusions: Preliminary user feedback suggests that the Child <b>Feeding</b> <b>Guide</b> is filling a critical gap in available support resources. Caregivers and health professionals report that it is easy to use, helpful and accessible. While initial user testing of the Child <b>Feeding</b> <b>Guide</b> confirms its value, further formal testing of this resource is required prior to wider-scale roll-out...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{was part of}} the session : Pedagogy: Procedures, Scaffolds, Strategies, Tactics 24 th National Conference on the Beginning Design StudentShop safety courses have long been the only way to introduce beginning design students to the tools, methods and appropriate behaviors in the shop environment. These courses and programs are geared towards providing important knowledge so the student can successfully engage the shop. However, they lack hands on experience and can often lead to creating a culture of fear with some students around certain tools and operations. The wood shop acclimation project is executed shortly after students take the shop safety course and prior to being asked to make anything in the shop on their own. It is provided to allow for greater hands on instruction for each student, creating in the students a better sense of confidence in operating the equipment safely and efficiently. The project was conceived as a way to efficiently mass produce a specific item that each student would be required to build to support their current studio project in some way, as a site or as a display. The faculty designs these items and the students would be shown why the item was designed the way it was. Often highlighting economy of means as major design consideration. Since each project always uses plywood as its main material the dimensions of that sheet in relation to each item's components are carefully calculated to minimize scrap. Instilling in the students an important lesson in valuing material. A step-by-step process is designed and laid out for the students. It takes them from a full sheet of plywood to the final assembled item. Along the way certain tools such as the panel saw, table saw and compound sliding miter saw are described {{in terms of what they}} do well and why they are being chosen to perform the specific operation in the process. As an extension to the shop safety course, students are given three concepts to apply to each tool in order to operate it safely and without damage to it, them or the material. These concepts are <b>feed,</b> <b>guide</b> and support and are described at each part of the process on each tool. This gives the students a starting point to correctly evaluate how they need to use the machines properly. Lastly throughout the process students are given an introduction into the appropriate use of jigs and fixtures to aid in the process of mass-producing the item. This stresses the importance of planning out the sequence of how you make something as well as supporting the decision of which tool to use for a specific operation. For example a sled is made for the table saw with multiple fixtures attached to it allowing each part to be cut efficiently and precisely with out measuring that can often lead to error. Also assembly jigs are made so that holes can be drilled identically without the need to measure and mark. The wood shop acclimation project not only serves as an important safety and instructional tool but also as a means to show the students via the design process a way to consider construction, fabrication sequencing and logic related to material and fabrication processes. And most importantly instill in the students a high level of knowledge driven comfort in engaging the wood shop...|$|E

40|$|As a species, {{the dog is}} unique. Depending on the breed, {{body weight}} varies 100 -fold from the 1 -kg Chihuahua to the 115 -kg St. Bernard (1). The time taken for a growing puppy to achieve adult body weight also varies {{considerably}} with larger breeds having a longer growth period than smaller breeds. Also {{the rate of growth}} during this period is not constant; energy requirements decrease from 3 times maintenance at weaning to 1. 2 times maintenance as the puppy approaches adulthood (1). The provision of accurate <b>feeding</b> <b>guides</b> is essential if under- and overnutrition are to be prevented. Overnutrition of dogs results in obesity, but in large breeds overnutrition also causes musculoskeletal disorders (2, 3). However, present <b>feeding</b> <b>guides</b> are based on "typical" growth data that use only a single equation (4, 5). Breed-specific differences in growth patterns might be expected due to huge variations in size, temperament, and coat type, all of which are likely to affect energy requirements. This was evident in a study of six breeds of puppies that demonstrated very different energy requirements despite similar absolute body weights in Great Danes versus Newfoundlands and Briards versus Labrador Retrievers (6). Little information is published on breed-specific variations in puppy growth patterns, and most studies provide only limited data on single breeds, for example, 8 - 34 -mo-old and 6 - 20 -wk-old Labrador Retrievers (7, 9) and 0 - 12 -wk-old German Shepherds (8). Other studies are confounded by the use of different groups of dogs to provide data for a variety of age groups (10).

However, its application in other countries requires certain adaptations. Aim: To adapt the HEI to the Chilean population and to assess its value in Chilean school age children and adults. Material anal methods: A random sample of 264 school age children aged 13. 4 ± 0. 7 years and 264 adults aged 35. 7 ± 0. 6 years was studied. A 24 hours food recall was done and the HEI seas calculated considering 10 variables based in the <b>Feeding</b> <b>Guides</b> for the Chilean population. Feeding habits were classified as healthy when the score was over 80 (of a maximum of 100), as requiring changes when the score was between 51 and 80 and as unhealthy when the score was 50 or less. Results: The mean scores {{for children and adults}} were 58. 4 ± 11. 3 and 56. 2 ± 11. 1 respectively (p< 0. 02). The variables with lower scores were vegetables, fruits, dairy products and sodium.
