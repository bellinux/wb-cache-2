5|$|Ibicella lutea {{is another}} flypaper protocarnivore {{that has been}} the subject of several studies. Early studies {{concluded}} that the plant digested proteinaceous offerings, though the methods were crude. Subsequent studies done more carefully tested for the presence of protease activity and found none, though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the plant has a great capacity for capturing and killing prey.|$|E
5|$|In March 2005, Wessex Trains, {{the company}} {{managing}} the {{station at the}} time, introduced car parking charges. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> this resulted in less use of the car parks, more local street parking and caused people to drive to Nailsea and Backwell railway station, where parking was still free. Following local pressure, the charges were reduced in July 2005.|$|E
5|$|In the 1989 form nominating {{it for the}} National Register of Historic Places, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> {{the church}} had {{undergone}} only minor alterations, including an interior redecoration in 1964, the replacement of roof slates with asphalt shingles in 1977, {{and the addition of}} a concrete ramp for access by the handicapped in 1986.|$|E

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> {{the naming}} process would remain stalled without such rules, {{and that even}} with them, few of these bodies can be imaged with {{sufficient}} resolution to determine their shapes.

5|$|Tahyna Tozzi portrays Emma, a mutant {{with the}} power to turn her skin into diamond, who in the film is Silverfox's sister. The film {{depiction}} of Emma was originally intended to be Emma Frost. However <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> she does not exhibit the character's traditional telepathic abilities. It is later revealed by Bryan Singer that this character is actually not Emma Frost, but instead a mutant with similar abilities.|$|E
5|$|A {{squall line}} which moved {{offshore}} New York and southern New England formed a mesoscale convective vortex, which fired new thunderstorm activity each day {{as it moved}} within the westerlies across the northern Atlantic. Once it reached mid-ocean, an increasingly northerly steering flow dropped the system down into the subtropics {{to the east of}} Bermuda, and it maintained decent organization. By 2100UTC on July 24, the National Hurricane Center began classifying the system as Tropical Depression Two. In the first advisory on the depression, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the previous tropical depression was erroneously classified as Tropical Depression Two.|$|E

5|$|Also in March 1941, 91 Squadron moved in, {{equipped}} with Spitfires. Additional dispersals and fighter pens {{as well as}} three new blister hangars were built during 1941. Typhoons were based at Lympne from March 1942 to February 1944 {{to counter the threat}} posed by the Luftwaffe's newly introduced Focke-Wulf Fw 190s and a runway was extended across Otterpool Lane to accommodate the Typhoons. In November 1944, Lympne was downgraded to Emergency Landing Ground status. Consideration was given to building four runways at Lympne, with the longest being , but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> serious demolition work would be required and a number of roads would need to be closed.|$|E
5|$|Before long, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> {{there were}} {{discrepancies}} between Audisio's original story published in L'Unità, subsequent versions that he provided and the versions of events provided by others. Although his account most probably {{is built around}} the facts, it was certainly embellished. The discrepancies and obvious exaggerations, coupled {{with the belief that}} the Communist Party had selected him to claim responsibility for their own political purposes, led some in Italy to believe that his story was wholly or largely untrue.|$|E
5|$|Dislocations are {{the most}} common {{structural}} defect in natural diamond. The two major types of dislocations are the glide set, in which bonds break between layers of atoms with different indices (those not lying directly above each other) and the shuffle set, in which the breaks occur between atoms of the same index. The dislocations produce dangling bonds which introduce energy levels into the band gap, enabling the absorption of light. Broadband blue photoluminescence has been reliably identified with dislocations by direct observation in an electron microscope, however, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> not all dislocations are luminescent, and there is no correlation between the dislocation type and the parameters of the emission.|$|E

5|$|In October 2016 the Emerging Markets newspaper, {{which was}} {{reportedly}} {{published by the}} International Monetary Fund/World Bank, declared Dar as 'Finance Minister of the year 2016 for South Asia'. The award was received by the Pakistan Ambassador to the United States Jalil Abbas Jilani on behalf of Dar. Following the award, several government officials jumped to congratulate him for winning such a 'prestigious' award. The International Monetary Fund said the newspaper {{did not belong to}} it and was an independent publication. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> five Pakistani state-owned firms funded the Emerging Markets edition, which carried a supplement on Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|Sviatoslav's {{appearance}} {{has been}} described very clearly by Leo the Deacon, who himself attended the meeting of Sviatoslav with John I Tzimiskes. Following Deacon's memories, Sviatoslav was a blue-eyed male of average height but of stalwart build, much more sturdy than Tzimiskes. He shaved his blond head and his beard but wore a bushy mustache and a sidelock {{as a sign of}} his nobility. He preferred to dress in white, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> his garments were much cleaner than those of his men, although he had a lot in common with his warriors. He wore a single large gold earring bearing a carbuncle and two pearls.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{spent the}} {{following}} months {{preparing for the}} forthcoming dash for the pole. They built sledges that would facilitate fast travel over rough terrain and constructed kayaks on the Inuit model, for use during the expected water crossings. There were endless trials of special clothing and other gear. Violent and prolonged tremors began to shake the ship on 3 January 1895, and two days later the crew disembarked, expecting the ship to be crushed. Instead the pressure lessened, and the crew went back on board and resumed preparations for Nansen's journey. After the excitement <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> Fram had drifted beyond Greely's Farthest North record of 83°24, and on 8 January was at 83°34′N.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} {{over a period}} of eight weeks by a small team of developers, using the Unity game engine. The idea was originally drawn onto a whiteboard, after the drawing remained in the developer's office for a few days it was decided that it would be the next project undertaken by the team. Off-Road Velociraptor Safari received positive reviews from gaming websites for its macabre humor and gameplay, though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the game had not been fully optimized on release, causing the game to run slowly on less modern machines.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{recorded}} football {{match in}} Sheffield occurred in 1794 when {{a game of}} mob football was played between Sheffield and Norton (at the time a Derbyshire village) that took place at Bents Green. The game lasted three days, which was not unusual for matches at the time. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> although there were some injuries no-one was killed during the match. The Clarkehouse Road Fencing Club had been playing football since 1852. The city was home {{to a number of}} sports clubs and the popularity of cricket had led to the chairman of Sheffield Cricket Club to suggest the construction of Bramall Lane.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between Georgetown's Floyd and North Carolina's Worthy also drew some {{attention from the}} media. The two players grew up in Gastonia, North Carolina together, where {{they went to the}} same church and competed in high school against each other. Worthy commented that his family lives around two to three miles away from Floyd's. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the two would likely not interact much while playing as they did not play the same position.|$|E
