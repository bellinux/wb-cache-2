A rep from Disney told TMZ: [...] "This is an {{unauthorized}} use of Brenda Song's image and her personal attorney has issued a cease and desist to the advertiser." [...] Song filed a libel suit seeking $100,000 in damages.

Ambrose Burnside assumed command of the Army of the Potomac on November 9, 1862. McClellan wrote to his wife, [...] "Those in whose {{judgment}} I rely tell me that I fought the battle splendidly {{and that it was}} a masterpiece of art. ... <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done all that can be asked in twice saving the country. ... I feel some little pride in having, with a beaten & demoralized army, defeated Lee so utterly. ... Well, one of these days history will I trust do me justice." ...|$|E

500|$|Accrington Stanley re-signed McEvilly on {{a one-year}} {{contract}} following his departure from Wrexham. On his return to Accrington he commented; [...] "I am back here because <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> unfinished business. I played well for a year here and I {{want to do the}} same again". He had played 10 games in League Two and one game in the League Cup failing to score, and picking up a red card for violent conduct after a stamp on Peterborough United winger Jamie Day in their 2–0 home loss on 1 September. However, McEvilly struggled to hold down a regular place in the Accrington side and was loaned out to former club, Rochdale in November 2007. On his return to Spotland Stadium, he scored the only goal of Rochdale's 1–0 win over Mansfield Town on 24 November, with a shot {{from the edge of the}} penalty area. McEvilly made a total of seven appearances for Rochdale scoring three goals, before returning in January 2008. He made one more appearance for Accrington, coming on as a substitute in the 73rd minute for Paul Mullin in the 2–0 defeat to Stockport County on 12 January, before joining Cambridge United on loan on 18 January. McEvilly made 14 appearances and scored three goals for Cambridge, helping them finish second place in the 2007–08 Conference National, securing a place in the playoffs. In Cambridge's playoff semi-final first leg, they drew 2–2 with Burton Albion away at the Pirelli Stadium with McEvilly scoring both Cambridge's goals. Cambridge were 2–0 down and McEvilly came on as a substitute for Mark Beesley in the 74th minute. Paul Hurst was deemed to have handled in the penalty area, and four minutes later McEvilly converted the penalty four minutes after coming off the bench. He scored his second goal from a direct free kick. In the following leg, McEvilly started the game and had a shot within the opening 30 seconds which Rob Wolleaston managed to score from the rebound, before being replaced by Leo Fortune-West in the 77th minute. McEvilly played in the final, in which Exeter City defeated Cambridge 1–0 at Wembley Stadium.|$|E

2500|$|Bassey's first {{marriage}} was to Kenneth Hume in 1961. The couple separated in 1964 and divorced in 1965 {{in the wake}} of the singer's affair with actor Peter Finch. Bassey then announced to the press that she and Finch would not be marrying, telling the press: [...] "It simply wouldn't work out. Just now I am not ready for marriage to anyone. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to be free." [...] A year later, Hume sued the actor and another man, John McAuliffe, for being [...] "indiscreet" [...] with the singer. Both Finch and McAuliffe were cited as co-respondents in the Hume–Bassey divorce.

2500|$|Onions was {{selected}} for England's tour of South Africa in November 2009 to January 2010. His bowling average for the series was in the 40s, but his batting twice helped England save a Test in a battling rearguard action on the fifth day. He was dropped for the fourth and final Test in favour of Ryan Sidebottom. Onions {{felt that he was}} denied an opportunity to bowl in conditions more suited to his style of bowling than previous matches and was surprised by his omission. He commented that [...] "When Straussy gave me the bad news, my reaction was one of sheer surprise. You could have knocked me down with last year's Newcastle season ticket. I tried to rationalise what had happened. I know my stats haven't been brilliant, but <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> bowled well enough to earn a better return." [...] South African fast-bowler Dale Steyn remarked that South Africa too were surprised at Onions being dropped: [...] "He would have been a handful on this wicket, he gets very tight into the stumps and could have been very dangerous... obviously Onions has troubled a lot of our batsmen throughout the series and it's surprising to see he wasn't playing. It {{was a bit of a}} relief in a way." ...|$|E
