25|$|After US courts merged law and equity, American law courts adopted {{many of the}} {{procedures}} of equity courts. The procedures {{in a court of}} equity were much more flexible than the courts at common law. In American practice, certain devices such as <b>joinder,</b> counterclaim, cross-claim and interpleader originated in the courts of equity. Also, the modern class action evolved out of the equitable doctrine of virtual representation, which enabled a court of equity to fully dispose of an estate even though it might contain contingent interests held by persons over which the court did not have direct jurisdiction.|$|E

On 22 April 2010 the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina pronounced the first-instance verdict finding both the accused guilty of knowingly assisting in the perpetration {{of the crime of}} genocide because, as members of the special police force of the 2nd Detachment of the Šekovići Special Police of the Republika Srpska MUP, they participated in keeping the road passable during the transportation of Bosniaks by trucks and buses, for later capturing a large number of Bosniak men who attempted to escape from the UN Safe Area and taking them to Kravica Farming Cooperative where they participated in their execution.

500|$|On February 18, 1993, Croatian {{authorities}} {{signed the}} Daruvar Agreement with local Serb leaders in Western Slavonia. The {{aim of the}} secret agreement was normalizing life for local populations near the frontline. However, authorities in Knin learned of this and arrested the Serb leaders responsible. In June 1993, Serbs began voting in a referendum on merging Krajina territory with Republika Srpska. Milan Martić, acting as the RSK interior minister, advocated a merger of the [...] "two Serbian states as the first stage {{in the establishment of}} a state of all Serbs" [...] in his April 3 letter to the Assembly of the Republika Srpska. On January 21, 1994, Martić stated that he would [...] "speed up the process of unification and pass on the baton to all Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević" [...] if elected president of the RSK." [...] Efforts to unify the Croatian Krajina and the Bosnian Krajina continued throughout 1992 until 1995. The evidence shows that the RSK leadership sought an alliance, and eventually unification, with the RS in BiH and that Milan Martić was in favour of such unification. A letter dated April 3, 1993 from, inter alia, Milan Martic as minister of the interior to the Assembly of the RS, written on behalf of [...] "the Serbs from the RSK", advocates a <b>joinder</b> of the [...] "two Serbian states as the first stage in the establishment of a state of all Serbs". Moreover, in this regard, the Trial Chamber recalls the evidence concerning operation Koridor 92. On January 21, 1994, during the election campaign for the RSK presidential elections, Milan Martić stated that he would [...] "speed up the process of unification" [...] and [...] "pass on the baton to our all Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic." [...] These intentions were countered by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 871 in October 1993, when the UNSC affirmed {{for the first time that}} the United Nations Protected Areas, i.e. the RSK held areas, were an integral part of the Republic of Croatia.|$|E

40|$|U komparativnom pravu i sudskoj praksi vrlo su česti sporovi u kojima dioničari i drugi ulagatelji zahtijevaju naknadu štete od uvrštenog dioničkog društva zbog toga jer je ono povrijedilo propise o objavljivanju podataka na tržištu kapitala. U američkom pravu koje je kolijevka kolektivnog parničenja dioničara/ulagatelja u odnosu na uvrštena društva, sve se više spominje arbitraža kao moguće rješenje. Kako se u tim sporovima na aktivnoj strani redovito pojavljuje veliki broj dioničara, a na pasivnoj strani pored samog društva, članovi uprave, nadzornog odbora te širok krug osoba izvan društva (jamac izdanja i sl.), rješavanje ovih sporova arbitražnim putem zahtijeva iznalaženje odgovora na brojna pitanja: od toga jesu li i u kojoj mjeri ti sporovi arbitrabilni, na koji se način može sklopiti valjani arbitražni ugovor u složenim okolnostima višestranačke arbitraže te koje je uvjete u pogledu postupka potrebno ispuniti u provedbi takve u pravilu višestranačke arbitraže. Također se iznose specifičnosti koje postoje u pogledu izvođenja dokaza, te prepreke na koje stranke u takvim višestranačkim arbitražama nailaze u etapi priznanja i ovrhe. Način na koji se ta pitanja prelamaju u našem pravu, uzevši u obzir različite pristupe u komparativnom pravu, predmet je ovog rada. Disputes {{in which}} {{shareholders}} and other investors sue listed joint stock companies for damages {{for failing to}} fulfill the obligation to disclose information on the capital market may take many different forms. There may be failure to disclose on the primary market (the prospectus) {{as well as on}} the secondary market (periodical and ad hoc disclosures). This may consist of failure to disclose truthful or timely information. On the claimant 2 ̆ 7 s side there may be a large number of shareholders or other investors since these are companies with a dispersed corporate structure. On the respondent 2 ̆ 7 s side, apart from persons within the company (the company itself, the management and the members of the supervisory board) there may also be third persons, i. e. those from outside the company (interpreters, auditors, etc). The specific character of such disputes is that the court 2 ̆ 7 s decision on the merits of the case, i. e. whether the company is liable for the violation of the duty to disclose, ought to have a binding effect on all investors because they would be in a procedural position of unique <b>joinders.</b> In view of the unique joindership on the claimant 2 ̆ 7 s side, particular jurisdictions have developed collective suits for the protection of investors rights, such as class action. Some countries of the continental circle have introduced legislation, trying to solve these probems in the spirit of the continental procedural law tradition. The latest trend observed in US law is the idea that such disputes should be resolved through arbitration. While considering such matters in the context of Croatian civil procedural law, we have concluded that the matter of the jurisdiction of the court for settling such disputes will depend on the status of the plaintiff, and, therefore, we consider that this matter should de lege ferenda fall within the jurisdiction of commercial courts as specialized courts. If this conclusion could not be drawn from the interpretation of existing regulations (a broader interpretation of the concept of „membership rights“), then a legislative intervention would be required. As far as concerns the arbitrability ratione materiae in such disputes, the authors are of the opinion that they are arbitrable, although mandatory and non-mandatory rules overlap in this area. The decisive criterion is the disponibility of the disputed claim, which is usually understood as a possibility to settle a dispute, which in the author 2 ̆ 7 s opinion is possible in such disputes. Since there is no exclusive court jurisdiction in such disputes, there is no (objective) barrier to arbitrability. As regards the request that the arbitration agreement should be in written form, the arbitration clause contained in the joint stock company 2 ̆ 7 s charter could be the best solution and would be binding on all shareholders, the management and members of the supervisory board, and also on the legal successors of shareholders, regardless of the fact that agreements on the selling of shares are reached informally, not necessarily in written form. The problem of establishing the jurisdiction of the arbitration tribunal exists when the jurisdiction of the tribunal should be extended to persons outside the company. We may assume that the issuer may agree to establish arbitration clauses with such a person in the relevant main contracts, but the question which arises is whether on the basis of such arbitration clauses arbitration proceedings could be instituted for all the interested parties, and whether these already initiated proceedings can be consolidated, especially among those parties which do not have direct contractual relations. That is why it is advisable to have consent on multy-party arbitration in each separate main contract and build it into all the arbitration clauses. The issuer, who is the only one connected with all the other parties in such potential arbitration proceedings, and in control of the situation, must make sure that the clauses are worded in such a way as to cover the expected field of application of ratione paersonae i ratione materiae. In view of the reality of multy-party arbitration and consolidation of the proceedings, it would be better to select the jurisdiction of the arbitration institution rather than ad hoc arbitration, because many of the proceedural issues could be resolved by agreeing on the arbitration rules of the respective arbitration institutions (appointment of arbitrators, consolidation of proceedings). All the potential co-plaintiffs should be given the possibility to participate in proceedings, which then inevitably raises the question of keeping them informed. Apart from the company 2 ̆ 7 s official bulletin, another way of keeping shareholders (investors) informed about the on-going arbitration proceedings is by using the official register of prescribed information, established by the Law on the Capital Market. Die Rechtsstreitigkeiten, in denen Aktionäre und andere Anleger von einer börsennotierten Gesellschaft Schadenersatz verlangen, weil diese die kapitalmarktlichen Publizitätspflichten verletzt hat, können vielerlei Form haben. Es kann zur Verletzung der Pflichten auf dem Primärmarkt (Prospekt) sowie auf dem Sekundärmarkt (periodische und Ad-hoc-Mitteilungen) gekommen sein. Die Verletzung kann in der fehlerhaften oder nicht rechtzeitigen Veröffentlichung von Daten bestehen. Auf der Aktivseite kann eine große Anzahl von Aktionären und anderen Anlegern in Erscheinung treten, da es sich um Gesellschaften mit einer dispersierten korporativen Struktur handelt. Auf der Passivseite können neben Personen innerhalb der Gesellschaft (der Gesellschaft selbst, Vorständen und Aufsichtsräten) auch Dritte, Außenstehende auftreten. Das Spezifikum solcher Rechtsstreitigkeiten liegt darin, dass die Entscheidung des Gerichts über die Frage, ob die Gesellschaft für die Verletzung haftbar zu machen ist (weil sie etwa einen fehlerhaften Prospekt veröffentlicht hat) dieselbe Wirkung gegen alle Anleger entfalten müsste, denen in diesem Teil wohl die Rolle von Streitgenossen zukäme. Wegen der Streitgenossenschaft insbesondere auf der Aktivseite haben einige Rechtssysteme kollektive Schutzmechanismen für die Rechte der Anleger vorgesehen, wie etwa die class action, bzw. die Sammelklage, während einige Länder der kontinentalen Tradition Vorschriften erlassen haben, mit denen sie versuchen, die Probleme im Sinne der kontinentalen Prozessrechtstradition zu beseitigen. Die neueste Tendenz, die im Recht der USA zum Tragen kommt, besagt, dass solche Streitigkeiten vor dem Schiedsgericht beigelegt werden sollten. Vor dem Hintergrund des kroatischen Rechtes kommen wir bezüglich dieser Fragen zu dem Schluss, dass die gerichtliche Zuständigkeit für solche Streitigkeiten (Handels- oder Amtsgericht) vom Status des Klägers abhängt, weshalb unseres Erachtens die Frage de lege ferenda durch die Erklärung der Zuständigkeit der Handelsgerichte als Fachgerichte zu klären ist. Sollte dies aus der Auslegung der positiven Vorschriften nicht abzuleiten sein (erweitertes Verständnis der Konzeption der „Gesellschafterrechte“), wäre ein gesetzgeberischer Eingriff erforderlich. Hinsichtlich der (objektiven) Arbitrabilität dieser Streitigkeiten, stehen die Autorinnen auf dem Standpunkt, dass sie arbitrabel sind, obwohl in diesem Bereich zwingende und dispositive Vorschriften miteinander vermischt sind. Das entscheidende Kriterium ist die Disponibilität des Streitgegenstandes, die gewöhnlich als Möglichkeit, einen Vergleich zu schließen, aufgefasst wird, was bei diesen Streitigkeiten möglich ist. Da es bei diesen Streitigkeiten keine ausschließliche Zuständigkeit eines Gerichtes gibt, so steht eine solche auch der (objektiven) Arbitrabilität nicht im Wege. Für die Forderung, dass der Schiedsgerichtsvertrag in schriftlicher Form vorliegen muss, könnte eine Schiedsgerichtsklausel in der Satzung der Aktiengesellschaft die beste Lösung sein, die für alle Aktionäre, Vorstands- und Aufsichtsratsmitglieder und auch die Rechtsnachfolger der Aktionäre verbindlich wäre, ungeachtet der formlosen Aktienverkaufsverträge, die nicht in schriftlicher Form abgeschlossen werden. Das Problem, ein Schiedsgericht für zuständig zu erklären, kommt in Bezug auf Dritte stärker zum Ausdruck. Wir können davon ausgehen, dass der Emittent mit solchen Personen in den jeweiligen Hauptverträgen Schiedgerichtsklauseln vereinbaren kann, doch es stellt sich die Frage, ob man mit all diesen Subjekten aufgrund solcher Schiedsgerichtsklauseln ein einheitliches Schiedsgerichtsverfahren führen kann und ob bereits aufgenommene Verfahren dieser Art konsolidiert werden können, insbesondere zwischen jenen Parteien, die nicht in einem unmittelbaren Rechtsverhältnis stehen. Daher ist es empfehlenswert, in alle Schiedsgerichtsklauseln die Zustimmung zu einem Mehrparteienschiedsgericht aufzunehmen. Der Emittent, der als einziger mit allen anderen Parteien in einem solchen potentiellen Schiedsgerichtsverfahren verbunden ist, müsste darauf achten, dass die Redaktion dieser Klauseln den erwarteten Anwendungsbereich ratione personae und ratione materiae erfasst. Mit Blick auf die reale Möglichkeit eines Mehrparteienschiedsgerichtes und der Verfahrenskonsolidierung ist es besser, die Zuständigkeit einer schiedsgerichtlichen Institution zu wählen, da viele Verfahrensfragen nach im Vorhinein festgelegten, in den Handbüchern der jeweiligen Schiedsgerichtsinstitutionen vorgesehen Regeln geklärt werden können (Wahl des Schiedsrichters, Verfahrenszusammenlegung). Allen potentiellen Streitgenossen sollte die Möglichkeit offen stehen, sich an dem Verfahren zu beteiligen, was die Frage ihrer obligatorischen Benachrichtigung aufwirft. Außer dem Gesellschaftsorgan könnte zur Benachrichtigung der Aktionäre (Anleger) von dem eingeleiteten Schiedsgerichtsverfahren auch das amtliche Register für Pflichtinformationen dienen, das aufgrund des Gesetzes über den Kapitalmarkt eingerichtet wurde...|$|R
