5|$|After {{relative}} stability {{at the senior}} executive level for three decades, there has been significant turnover in the positions since the 1990s. The team had eight general managers in eight years, for example, between 1996 and 2003. The current GM <b>is</b> <b>Jim</b> Popp who was appointed {{at the end of}} 207 February 2017. Chris Rudge, former head of the Canadian Olympic Committee, took over as president and CEO from the beginning of 2012 to the end of 2015, when Michael Copeland took over.|$|E
5|$|Crisis on Infinite Earths, {{a limited}} miniseries {{published}} in 1985, {{was written in}} order to reduce the complex history of DC Comics to a single continuity. Although Batgirl is a featured character, her role is relatively small—she delivers Supergirl's eulogy in issue seven of the 12-part series. The conclusion of Crisis on Infinite Earths changed DC Universe continuity in many ways. Following the reboot, Barbara Gordon is born to Roger and Thelma Gordon, and she <b>is</b> <b>Jim</b> Gordon's niece and adopted daughter in current canon. Post-Crisis, Supergirl does not arrive on Earth until after Gordon has established herself as Oracle, and many of the adventures she shared with Batgirl are retroactively described as having been experienced by Power Girl. In Secret Origins #20 (1987), Barbara Gordon's origin is rebooted by author Barbara Randal. Within the storyline, Gordon recounts the series of events that lead to her career as Batgirl, including her first encounter with Batman as a child, studying martial arts under the tutelage of a sensei, memorizing maps and blue prints of the city, excelling in academics in order to skip grades, and pushing herself to become a star athlete.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{recorded}} home {{attendance was}} during a match against Preston North End {{in the sixth}} round of the FA Cup, at the Manor Ground, on 29 February 1964. The attendance was 22,750, which exceeded the stadium's capacity, so scaffolding was {{needed in order to}} create temporary stands for the additional supporters. The largest attendance at the Kassam Stadium for a football match was 12,243 during the final game of the 2005–06 League Two season against Leyton Orient. Oxford's largest-ever scoreline was a 9–1 win in the FA Cup first round versus Dorchester Town on 11 November 1995. In the league, their largest win was 7–0 versus Barrow in Division Four. Their largest defeat was 7–0 away to Sunderland in 1998. Their longest unbeaten run in the league was 20 matches in 1984. John Shuker holds the record for the most league appearances with 478 between 1962 and 1977. John Aldridge holds the record for most league goals scored in a season in the 1984–85 season, scoring 30. Graham Atkinson holds the record for the most league goals with 77, as well as most overall goals with 107. The most capped player in internationals <b>is</b> <b>Jim</b> Magilton, with 18 caps for Northern Ireland. The largest amount of money Oxford have received by selling a player was an estimated £3,000,000 for Kemar Roofe's transfer to Leeds United in July 2016. The largest transfer fee Oxford have paid was £470,000 for Dean Windass' transfer from Aberdeen in August 1998, though the undisclosed fee paid for Marvin Johnson {{at the start of the}} 2016–17 season is thought to have exceeded this figure. Oxford are the only team in history to be promoted consecutively from Division Three to the First Division as Champions.|$|E

25|$|The Mayor <b>is</b> <b>Jim</b> Kenney, who {{replaced}} Michael Nutter, who served two terms from 2009 to January 2016. Kenney, as all Philadelphia mayors have been since 1952, {{is a member}} of the Democratic Party, which tends to dominate local politics so thoroughly that the Democratic Mayoral primary is often more widely covered than the general election. The legislative branch, the Philadelphia City Council, consists of ten council members representing individual districts and seven members elected at large. Democrats currently hold 14 seats, with Republicans representing two allotted at-large seats for the minority party, as well as the Northeast-based Tenth District. The current council president is Darrell Clarke.|$|E

One player was quoted as saying, [...] "The sad thing about the Galarraga game <b>is,</b> <b>Jim</b> Joyce is seriously one of the best umpires around... He always calls it fair, so players love him. Everyone makes mistakes, and it's terrible that this happened to him." [...] Furthermore, the players in this poll overwhelmingly endorsed (86%) Selig's decision not to overturn the call, and were overwhelmingly against (77%) instituting replay for calls on the bases.|$|E

500|$|Ashamed, Henry escapes into {{a nearby}} forest, where he discovers a {{decaying}} body in a peaceful clearing. In his distress, he hurriedly leaves the clearing and stumbles upon a group of injured men returning from battle. One member of the group, a [...] "tattered soldier", asks Henry where he is wounded, but the youth dodges the question. Among the group <b>is</b> <b>Jim</b> Conklin, who has {{been shot in the}} side and is suffering delirium from blood-loss. Jim eventually dies of his injury, defiantly resisting aid from his friend, and an enraged and helpless Henry runs from the wounded soldiers. He next joins a retreating column that is in disarray. In the ensuing panic, a man hits Henry on the head with his rifle, wounding him. Exhausted, hungry, thirsty, and now wounded, Henry decides to return to his regiment regardless of his shame. When he arrives at camp, the other soldiers believe his injury resulted from a grazing bullet during battle. The other men care for the youth, dressing his wound.|$|E

2500|$|Although Michener {{began his}} novel in prehistory, the series itself begins with {{elements}} from Chapter 4 of the book, [...] "The Many Coups of Lame Beaver." [...] The novel devotes an entire section to Kurt Brumbaugh's development of Central Beet company; the miniseries, however, makes only passing reference to it. The Wendells use the badger game to blackmail the town pastor {{out of his}} house in the miniseries, but in the book they get the house from a local businessman. In the miniseries, Morgan Wendell tries to cover up his family's shady history, but in the book he speaks openly about the murder and his father's admiration of the sheriff to the author- who in turn agrees to publish the facts of the killing after the election. Paul Garrett is in his 50s and <b>is</b> <b>Jim</b> and Charlotte Lloyd's grandson in the miniseries, but he is in his early 40s in the novel and <b>is</b> <b>Jim</b> and Charlotte's great-grandson. The miniseries skips a generation for the sake of simplicity. This skipped generation would have revealed that Paul Garrett is also a descendant of Maxwell & Lisette Mercy, Levi & Lucinda Zendt, and John Skimmerhorn (son of Colonel Skimmerhorn).|$|E
