Accordingly, our views on this point must necessarily be taken, to that extent, to be provisional in nature." [...] The Court said that adopting this approach ensures that an alleged contemnor is not disadvantaged with regard to the burden of proof: [...] "If the concept of fair criticism relates to liability, then the evidential burden would be on the party relying on it.

2500|$|Whether a {{real risk}} to {{confidence}} {{in the administration of}} justice was posed is a question of fact to be determined objectively, taking all the circumstances of the case into consideration. This includes factors such as the person making the statement, the nature of the statement itself, how widely it has been published, and [...] "local conditions" [...] such as the size of Singapore and the multiracial and multi-religious make-up of its populace. Local conditions may also mean that since those who come into contact with the impugned publication or words may not be objective reasonable persons, the court must be open to take reference from such affected groups, instead of the objective reasonable man. In addition, the Court also stated that the fact that judges are the sole arbiters of fact and law must also be taken into account when assessing the <b>impugned</b> <b>statement.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Court of Appeal {{held that}} the test for {{liability}} for scandalizing contempt is {{whether there is a}} real risk that the <b>impugned</b> <b>statement</b> has undermined – or might undermine – public confidence in the administration of justice. It avoided a detailed elaboration of the test because it opined that the test demonstrated its value in application. On this point, the Court disagreed with the High Court's reference to [...] "a small likelihood" [...] of shaking public confidence in the administration of justice to describe a situation where no contempt was committed. It felt that such an instance would involve a marginal case of contempt that might not merit the initiation of contempt proceedings in the first place. Gary Chan has [...] "warmly welcomed" [...] the Court's confirmation that the real risk test applies in Singapore as this signals [...] "a more liberal attitude towards the alleged contemnor in cases of scandalising contempt".|$|E
2500|$|In the High Court, Justice Quentin Loh made {{significant}} {{changes to the}} law when he rejected {{the use of the}} long-standing [...] "inherent tendency" [...] test that had been applied to establish the actus reus of the offence, and instead adopted a [...] "real risk" [...] test. This allows a court to take into consideration the circumstances surrounding the uttering or publication of the impugned words and to only hold someone liable if that person has created a real risk in the circumstances in which the impugned words were communicated. In addition, he ruled that should an <b>impugned</b> <b>statement</b> be found to have scandalized the court, the only applicable defence to contempt of court would be if the statement amounted to [...] "fair criticism". In doing so, he rejected justification and fair comment as defences. Applying the real risk test, Justice Loh found that 11 out of 14 impugned statements were contemptuous and that the defence of fair criticism did not apply to any of the statements. The High Court thus found Shadrake guilty of the offence of contempt by way of scandalizing the court and sentenced him to six weeks' imprisonment and a fine of S$20,000.|$|E
25|$|In a {{judgment}} dated 3 November 2010, the High Court rejected the long-standing inherent tendency test and instead adopted the real risk test.

Upon the application of the real risk test, 11 out of the 14 <b>impugned</b> <b>statements</b> were found to be contemptuous.|$|R
2500|$|The {{legal issues}} that were dealt with by the High Court were the following: (1) the proper test to be applied for {{determining}} whether scandalizing contempt was made out, and, specifically, whether the [...] "inherent tendency" [...] test or the [...] "real risk" [...] test should be applied to determine liability; (2) the defences available for the offence of scandalizing contempt; and (3) {{the application of the}} appropriate legal principles to the 14 <b>impugned</b> <b>statements.</b>|$|R

As well, SIRC found that CSIS knew that reliance would be placed on its advice by both the Ministers of Public Safety and Citizenship and Immigration, {{as well as the}} Federal Court. For this reason, and since HCI was not given an opportunity to respond to the <b>impugned</b> <b>statement,</b> CSIS should have taken care to avoid making an unsubstantiated statement which could lead to injury or loss of support and funding.|$|E

In the end, the Court found that three of the statements were not contemptuous as they did not unambiguously refer to the courts.

'I merely said I was very glad to approximate to any one on the ground of truth; i.e. rejoiced when truth immediately wrought out, in whatever degree, its own legitimate result of unity. O'Connell said he claimed half of me.... Count Montalembert came to me to-day (March 23rd), and sat long, for the purpose of ingenuously and kindly <b>impugning</b> certain <b>statements</b> in my book, viz. (1) That the peculiar tendency of the policy of romanism before the reformation went to limit in the mass of men intellectual exercise upon religion. (2) That the doctrine of purgatory adjourned until after death, more or less, the idea and practice of the practical work of religion. (3) That the Roman catholic church restricts the reading of the scriptures by the Christian people.

It was stated in the case, [...] "The Court cannot accept this argument. The lay judges exercised judicial functions. The <b>impugned</b> <b>statement</b> was not a criticism of the reasoning in the judgment of 28 January 1981, but rather, as found by the High Court in its judgment of 3 July 1984, a defamatory accusation against the lay judges personally, which was likely to lower them in public esteem and was put forward without any supporting evidence (see paragraph 13 above). In view of these considerations, the political context in which the tax case was fought cannot be regarded as relevant for the question of proportionality". Due to the fact that Mr. Barfod allegedly attacked the judges' personally, which could ruin their reputation and call into question their credibility, he was charged with the crime.|$|E
