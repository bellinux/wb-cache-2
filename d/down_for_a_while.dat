500|$|In January 2006, nine tracks {{recorded}} for the album were {{leaked to the}} Internet. In response to the leak, Garrett Tierney stated [...] "I would say it {{did it in a}} good way 'cause so many people were curious to hear what we have been doing—and for the most part, the record tracks don't sound anything like the leaked demos." [...] However, Lacey was not so upbeat when asked, saying, [...] "For me it was different. It had me pretty <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> No one likes to show their creation in mid-process, and those songs weren't done. They were like blueprints. Just the plan, right? It put me in a state where I {{was under the impression that}} those songs had been wasted or something—that we had to go and write new things because those had been heard. Now, in retrospect, I want those songs to be on the album and many of them aren't, and I'm probably more to blame for that than anyone. This record already feels incomplete to me without those tracks and probably will forever." ...|$|E
2500|$|This storyline saw the {{separation}} of Den and Angie. Holland and Smith had anticipated that Den and Angie would be popular, but they had not guessed how hysterical the reaction to them would be. It was decided that Den and Angie {{would have to be}} played <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> so that other characters would have the opportunity to shine through. [...] The next few years saw Den and Angie struggle to get by without each other and eventually they reunited as business partners.|$|E

[...] The next few years saw Den and Angie struggle to get by without each other and eventually they reunited as business partners. However, in 1988 Anita Dobson decided that she wanted to move on after three years playing Angie. She left in May 1988. Despite many alleged attempts at getting Dobson to reprise the role, she never accepted, commenting: [...] "Why tarnish the gorgeous creation that was Angie Watts?". The character of Angie Watts was subsequently killed off-screen in 2002 (dying of a drink related illness) and brought home to be buried by her on-screen daughter Sharon in order to facilitate the [...] return of the actress Letitia Dean. In 2010, Dobson said she was glad her character was killed off, as it was unrealistic that the character would ever return.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wouldn't {{you like}} to lie <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while?</b> aren't you tired?" [...] Rose hardly knew what weariness was, but she assented because she wished to be alone.|$|R
60|$|But {{at last he}} came in. The {{night was}} far advanced. He put down his hat and sat <b>down.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> long <b>while</b> he looked silently at Dr. Porhoët.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Vane," [...] she said, {{laying a}} hand upon his shoulder, [...] "I think you ought, at least, to lie <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while.</b> Isn't there <b>a</b> sofa in--in the parlour?" [...] she asked Euphrasia.|$|R
2500|$|In 1942, Dina Thanthi (Daily Telegraph) {{was started}} in Madurai with {{simultaneous}} editions in Madras, Salem and Tiruchirappalli. [...] It was founded by S.P. Adithanar, a lawyer trained in Britain. He modeled Thanthi on the style of an English tabloid- The Daily Mirror. He aimed to bring out a newspaper that ordinary people would read, and which would encourage a reading habit even among the newly literate. In the past, the daily newspaper which was printed in Madras reached the southern Tamil region after at least one day. Thanthi used the public bus system to distribute the paper throughout the south Tamil region and capitalized on the hunger for war news that arose after Singapore fell to the Japanese. Due to financial constraints, its Salem and Tiruchirappalli editions had to be closed <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> Thanthi emphasized local news, especially crime and the courts. It used photographs extensively and brought banner headlines to Tamil journalism. It could fit one story on an entire broadsheet page, mainly filled with large easy-to-read headlines. One of its biggest scoops was {{the murder of the}} editor of a scandalous film magazine by two actors. Thanthi covered the trial in Madras in detail, and its reporters phoned the daily account to the printing centre in Madurai. Thanthi was the first Tamil paper to understand the people’s fascination with crime and film stars. The paper was popular and it was said that Tamils learned to read in order to read the newspaper.|$|E
60|$|He crept up-stairs to lie <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> and 'on the way {{he laughed}} softly to himself.|$|E
60|$|We sat <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> {{and gazed}} in silence at this {{wonderful}} view. Presently Sir Henry spoke.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Clifford {{walked up}} and <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few minutes, <b>while</b> his {{daughter}} watched him anxiously.|$|R
60|$|The moon went <b>down.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> long <b>while</b> she {{had been}} getting nearer and nearer to the horizon. Now she finally sank and left the world in {{darkness}} save <b>for</b> <b>a</b> faint grey tinge in the eastern sky that palely heralded the dawn.|$|R
60|$|Again he filled, drank, sat <b>down,</b> and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> was merry. But {{presently}} {{the black}} thoughts {{came back into}} his mind. He rose, looked through the shutter-hole to the hillside. He could see nothing on it except {{the shadows of the}} clouds.|$|R
60|$|I {{pulled the}} door to again the moment his back was turned, and sat <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> to compose myself.|$|E
60|$|Disgusted {{with his}} failure, but more angry than ever, the panther lay <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> to {{consider}} {{what he should do}} next, and as he was thinking, an old man came by.|$|E
6000|$|... "I must sit <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> Edgar. I {{have eaten}} nothing since {{yesterday}} morning, and I have lost much blood, {{and all this}} happiness {{is too much for}} me. Don't think me very childish." ...|$|E
6000|$|She looked <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while,</b> {{then lifted}} her head and laid her hand upon my shoulder, adding slowly: [...] "Do you know, Allan, I {{think that it will}} at the--" [...] and {{suddenly}} she turned and left me with her sentence unfinished.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{came up on}} the {{ice from}} Circle City last winter," [...] he continued, [...] "and settled <b>down</b> here <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> Am {{prospecting}} some on Henderson Creek, and if that fails, have been thinking of trying my hand this fall up the Stuart River." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon I'd better lie <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while,</b> but I can't sleep. Ross {{may need}} me. There isn't {{a man to}} help him but me, and that loafer Ballard is full of gall. He's got it in for Ross, and will make trouble if he can." ...|$|R
6000|$|Checco and Matteo {{stood looking}} at one another; then the former, shaking himself as if to regain his calmness, {{turned his back on}} us and left the room. Matteo strode up and <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> in thought, and then, turning to me, said, 'Come.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} stop a moment longer in the room. I motioned {{him to get out}} of sight and made my way on the poop. That unplayful cub had the watch. I walked up and <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> {{thinking}} things out, then beckoned him over.|$|E
6000|$|But {{you should}} have seen how all the people stared and goggled!--Babo and the {{blacksmith}} and the nobleman's servants. The nobleman strutted up and <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> admiring himself, and then he got upon his horse again. [...] "But wait," [...] said Simon Agricola; [...] "you forgot to pay me my thousand golden angels." ...|$|E
50|$|The abrupt {{end to the}} slate-mining era only kept Leienkaulers <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> short <b>while.</b> It was {{not long}} before the former miners found new work with the Bundeswehr, which in the early 1960s sought more {{personnel}} for its bases at Büchel and Ulmen. Others found jobs in the service sector.|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} with the round face looked <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while</b> and smoked reflectively. The other and elder doctor had gone pacing nervously by himself upon the lawn. At length the round face was lifted again, and showed two round blue eyes with a certain frankness in them.|$|R
50|$|The 725s raced at Madison {{throughout}} the 1930s until the disastrous Ohio River flood of 1937 and World War II brought <b>down</b> the curtain <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b>|$|R
60|$|I sat <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> {{with wide}} eyes and open ears. Then I hunted up a saloon, {{where most of}} the guests had been or were going. I found a great square room lighted by six huge lamps, a bar at one side, and all the floor space taken up by tables and chairs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just so, just so," [...] {{said the}} professor, but a shade of trouble tinged the {{expression}} of his face, {{and a moment later}} he arose, saying that he felt weak and tired and would go to his sleeping room and lie <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> The fact was that Professor Maxon regretted the promise he had made von Horn relative to his daughter.|$|E
60|$|It {{was time}} for supper. The mother came <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> and we talked quietly, at random. Lettie did not utter a word about her engagement, not a suggestion. She made {{it seem as if}} things were just as before, {{although}} I am sure she had discovered that I had told George. She intended that we should play as if ignorant of her bond.|$|E
60|$|They {{both looked}} at each other. Sir Percival slowly drew his {{shoulder}} from under the Count's hand, slowly turned his face away from the Count's eyes, doggedly looked <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while</b> at the parchment on the table, and then spoke, with the sullen submission of a tamed animal, rather than the becoming resignation of a convinced man.|$|R
60|$|On {{approaching}} the shed I {{found that it}} {{had once been a}} boat-house, and that an attempt had apparently been made to convert it afterwards into a sort of rude arbour, by placing inside it a firwood seat, a few stools, and a table. I entered the place, and sat <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while</b> to rest and get my breath again.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{would gladly}} drink to our further acquaintanceship in the same,' said my companion, 'but {{as to the}} matter of slumber that may be readily arranged. If you ascend that ladder you will find in the loft a litter of empty sacks, upon which you can repose. For myself, I will stay <b>down</b> here <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> and cook myself another cake.' ...|$|R
60|$|She {{left him}} speechless, too amazed {{to think of}} making her any answer. It was Joan who had said these things to him, Joan the silent, with her hard, {{handsome}} face and her Lather's dogged silence. Never again would he believe that he understood anything whatsoever about women. He walked up and <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> restlessly, then put on his hat and walked across to the club.|$|E
6000|$|The light flickered, {{but it did}} {{not wholly}} go out. If it has not been shown that Cynthia was endowed with a fair amount of sense, many of these pages have been written in vain. She sat <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> in the park and thought of the many things she had to be thankful for--not the least of which was Jethro's kindness. And she remembered that she was to see [...] "Uncle Tom's Cabin" [...] that evening.|$|E
60|$|Now all {{happened}} as Sihamba expected, {{for on the}} first day that the cow was turned out, watched by the lad, who was provided with food and a blanket, so soon as it had filled itself it started straight over the hills, running at times, and at times stopping to graze, till night came on. Then it lay <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> and its herd beside it, for he had tied his wrist to its tail with a rimpi lest it should escape in the darkness.|$|E
60|$|They sat <b>down,</b> and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> the {{conversation}} was of general matters, chiefly concerned, however, with Andre-Louis, his occupations and his views. And all the while madame was studying him attentively with those gentle, wistful eyes, until again that sense of uneasiness began to pervade him. He realized instinctively {{that he had been}} brought here for some purpose deeper than that which had been avowed.|$|R
60|$|And outside he went, like a king, {{with all}} Sierra Vista {{about him and}} tending on him. He was very weak, and {{when he reached the}} lawn he lay <b>down</b> and rested <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b>|$|R
6000|$|He {{asked me}} if I would not sit down, and he offered me one of the camp-stools {{at the door of}} the marquee, and I did sit <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, <b>while</b> he flitted about the {{interior}} doing various little things. At last I said, [...] "How is this, Robert? I thought you had been assigned to a place in the communal refectory. You're not here on the old terms?" ...|$|R
