5|$|An {{analysis}} {{conducted using}} X-ray fluorescence <b>has</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pendant {{was made from}} a highly debased gold alloy, with only 37% of the alloy consisting of gold and the remainder consisting of silver with some copper. It {{is likely that the}} gold came from melted-down coins of the Merovingian dynasty of Francia. The Frankish currency underwent a similar debasing at around this time. The link with Francia is illustrative of the trading and cultural links that existed between Anglo-Saxon England and continental Europe at the time.|$|E
5|$|Living almost {{exclusively}} in the aphotic zone where little to no sunlight penetrates, the Portuguese dogfish is relatively common and the dominant shark species in deeper waters. The large, squalene-rich liver of this shark allows it to maintain neutral buoyancy and hover with minimal effort; males contain more squalene in their livers than females. A tracking study in the Porcupine Seabight <b>has</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Portuguese dogfish has an average swimming speed of , and does not remain in any particular area for long. This species may be preyed upon by larger fishes and sharks. Known parasites of this species include monogeneans in the genus Erpocotyle, and the tapeworms Sphyriocephalus viridis, S. richardi, and Anthobothrium sp.|$|E
5|$|Pacific {{populations of}} the false {{catshark}} were once regarded as a separate species, P. acrales. However, morphological comparisons have failed to find any consistent differences between P. microdon and P. acrales, leading {{to the conclusion that}} there is only one species of false catshark. The closest relatives of the false catshark are the gollumsharks (Gollum). Pseudotriakis and Gollum share a number of morphological similarities. Phylogenetic analysis using protein-coding genes <b>has</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> amount of genetic divergence between these taxa is less than that between some other shark species within the same genus. This result suggests that the many autapomorphies (unique traits) of the false catshark evolved relatively recently, and supports the grouping of Pseudotriakis and Gollum together in the family Pseudotriakidae.|$|E

25|$|Dengue {{virus is}} {{transmitted}} by the mosquito species Aedes aegypti. Aedes aegypti produce saliva that contains {{over one hundred}} unique proteins, including the protein family D7.

It was said that the mosquito’s spit could make the virus spread faster due to the weakened immune response of its host.

25|$|CST most {{commonly}} results from contiguous spread of infection from a nasal furuncle (50%), sphenoidal or ethmoidal sinuses (30%) and dental infections (10%). Less common primary sites of infection include tonsils, soft palate, middle ear, or orbit (orbital cellulitis). The highly anastomotic venous {{system of the}} paranasal sinuses allows retrograde spread of infection to the cavernous sinus via the superior and inferior ophthalmic veins. It was previously thought that veins in the area were valveless {{and that this was}} the major cause of the retrograde spread, however, a recent study <b>has</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ophthalmic and facial veins are not valveless.|$|E
25|$|Social {{psychological}} literature <b>has</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{level of}} motivation {{one has to}} engage in an activity influences one’s behavior in a group setting. This finding, deemed the collective effort model by Karau and Williams (1993, 2001) details that individuals who are more motivated {{are more likely to}} engage in social facilitation (that is, to increase one’s efforts when in the presence of others) whereas those who are less motivated are {{more likely to engage in}} social loafing. Researchers have determined that two factors which determine an individual’s motivation, and subsequently whether or not the individual will resort to social loafing versus social facilitation, include the individual’s expectations about attaining the goal and the perceived value of the goal.|$|E
25|$|GABRD encodes the δ subunit of the GABA receptor, {{which is}} a subunit {{yielding}} receptors which do not desensitize and are localized outside of the synapse. There are three mutations in this gene associated with JME, E177A, R220C, and R220H, all located in the N-terminus of the protein. The last of these mutations is also present in normal controls. Receptors containing the E177A mutation have greatly decreased current compared to wild-type. This {{is not the case}} for the R220C mutation but is similar to the R220H mutation, though to a lesser extent than the E177A mutation. More recent study <b>has</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> E177A mutant also has greatly decreased desensitization compared to wild-type receptors. Receptors containing only E177A or R220H mutants, versus heterozygotes, had significantly decreased surface expression compared to wild-type or heterozygotic receptors. These mutants also have decreased single-channel open times compared to wild-type. It should be noted, however, that these mutations are very rare as causes of JME.|$|E
