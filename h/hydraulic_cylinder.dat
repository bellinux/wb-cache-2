25|$|For {{five years}} the boat lift {{operated}} successfully, the longest closures being during spells of cold weather when the canal froze over. In 1882 a cast iron <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cylinder</b> burst while the caisson it supported was at canal level with a boat in it. The caisson descended rapidly, but water escaping from the burst cylinder slowed the rate of descent and the water-filled dock at river level softened the impact. No-one was hurt {{and there was no}} damage to the lift's superstructure. As a precaution, tests were carried out on the second <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cylinder.</b> During these tests the second cylinder failed too. As a result the boat lift was closed for six months while sections of both cylinders were replaced and the connecting pipework, which was thought to have contributed to their failure, was redesigned.|$|E

The method {{does not change the}} structure of the concrete pump truck, only need to replace the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cylinders</b> of booms with the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cylinders</b> with displacement senor, and the displacement sensors are mounted in the inside of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cylinders</b> and do not need any extra protection. The relationship formulas between the contraction and expansion amounts of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cylinders</b> and the pouring point location are derived and programmed to input into a data processing unit. The contraction and expansion amounts of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cylinders</b> are timely acquired and inputted into the data processing unit, then the pouring point location can be displayed in real-time on the screen of radio controller, and the workers can quickly and accurately locate the pouring point of the concrete pump truck to poured point...|$|R

25|$|The {{automatic}} reset design {{has only recently}} been introduced on American plows, but has been used extensively on European and Australian plows. In this construction the beam is hinged at a point nearly above {{the point of the}} share.

25|$|The {{automatic}} brake works by monitoring the speed using a centrifugal governor connected by gears {{to a large}} toothed gear mounted on the pinion axle next to the wheel (i.e. {{it is not the}} pinion gear). When the set speed is exceeded a lever on the governor hits a lever on a brake valve, and the brakes operate. The {{automatic brake}} can only be released after the train has come to a stop, and the driver has to leave the locomotive to reset the system. On the steam locomotives, steam is applied to a small brake cylinder that acts on the driver's side brakes. On the carriages, the automatic brake is an air brake. On the diesel locomotives, a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cylinder</b> is used.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>cylinders</b> (also called linear {{hydraulic}} motors) are mechanical actuators {{that are}} used to give a linear force through a linear stroke. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>cylinders</b> are able to give pushing and pulling forces of many metric tons with only a simple hydraulic system. Very simple <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cylinders</b> are used in presses; here, the cylinder consists of a volume in a piece of iron with a plunger pushed in it and sealed with a cover. By pumping hydraulic fluid in the volume, the plunger is pushed out with a force of plunger-area pressure.|$|R

A development of the 9E, the new engine incorporated numerous mechanical refinements to improve strength and reliability, albeit slightly {{at the cost of}} overall power, now rated at [...] at 4,500rpm. Rear suspension was completely revised, with trailing arm units controlled by Armstrong dampers. The rod and cable brake systems of previous cars was also replaced by a Lockheed semi hydraulic and rod braking system (front brake fully hydraulic, but rear brakes still rod operated from a central floor-mounted <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cylinder)</b> acting on all three wheels.|$|E

A power take-off on the transfer case, {{used with the}} transmission in gear, drove the hydraulic pump, the controls were inside the cab. The body had a tailgate that hinged from either the top or bottom. When the tailgate was hinged at the top the bottom could be opened while dumping with a lever on the left front corner of the body, just behind the driver's window. The front of the body had a stone-shield that covered the cab and the spare tire mounted between the cab and body.|$|E
2500|$|Horizontal {{bandsaws}} {{hold the}} workpiece stationary while the blade swings {{down through the}} cut. [...] This configuration is used to cut long materials such as pipe or bar stock to length. Thus {{it is an important}} part of the facilities in most machine shops. The horizontal design is not useful for cutting curves or complicated shapes. [...] Small horizontal bandsaws typically employ a gravity feed alone, retarded to an adjustable degree by a coil spring; on industrial models, the rate of descent is usually controlled by a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cylinder</b> that bleeds through an adjustable valve. [...] When the saw is set up for a cut, the operator raises the saw, positions the material to be cut underneath the blade, and then turns on the saw. [...] The blade slowly descends into the material, cutting it as the band blade moves. When the cut is complete, a switch is tripped and the saw automatically turns off. [...] More sophisticated versions of this type of saw are partially or entirely automated (via PLC or CNC) for high-volume cutting of machining blanks. Such machines provide a stream of cutting fluid recirculated from a sump, in the same manner that a CNC machining center does.|$|E
