5|$|Early in {{the fourth}} week the cephalic part bends sharply forward in a cephalic flexure. This flexed part becomes the {{forebrain}} (prosencephalon); the adjoining curving part becomes the midbrain (mesencephalon) and the part caudal to the flexure becomes the hindbrain (rhombencephalon). In the fifth week of developmement five brain vesicles have formed. The forebrain separates into two vesicles an anterior telencephalon and a posterior diencephalon. The telencephalon <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and related structures. The diencephalon <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the thalamus and hypothalamus. The hindbrain also splits into two areas – the metencephalon and the mylencephalon. The metencephalon <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the cerebellum and pons. The myelencephalon <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the medulla oblongata. Also during the fifth week, the brain divides into repeating segments called neuromeres. These are known as rhombomeres seen in the hindbrain.|$|E
5|$|Neuroanthropology is {{the study}} of the {{relationship}} between culture and the brain. It explores how the brain <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> culture, and how culture influences brain development. Cultural differences and their relation to brain development and structure are researched in different fields.|$|E
5|$|How species {{should be}} defined in a {{particular}} group of organisms <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> practical and theoretical problems that {{are referred to as}} the species problem. The scientific work of deciding how to define species has been called microtaxonomy. By extension, macrotaxonomy is the study of groups at higher taxonomic ranks, from subgenus and above only, than species.|$|E

5|$|The {{absolute}} state paternalism of totalitarian regimes, which naturally <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> {{the dominance}} of the archaic paternalistic ethical concept in medical practice. Professional consciousness of the doctor is based on the almost absolute right to make decisions without the patient's consent (i.e. there is disregard for the principle of informed consent to treatment or withdrawal from it).|$|E
5|$|The sperm whale's unique body is {{unlikely}} to be confused with any other species. The sperm whale's distinctive shape comes from its very large, block-shaped head, which can be one-quarter to one-third of the animal's length. The S-shaped blowhole is located very close {{to the front of the}} head and shifted to the whale's left. This <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> a distinctive bushy, forward-angled spray.|$|E
50|$|The {{addition}} of 6-thioguanine <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the DAT regimen, and the {{addition of}} 6-mercaptopurine <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the DAM regimen.|$|R
50|$|Aulatornoceras, type for the Aulatornoceratinae was {{previously}} considered a subgenus of Tornoceras {{and is known}} from the Upper Devonian of North America and Europe.

5|$|When {{the forms}} of {{traditional}} power come to an end, there {{tends to be a}} corresponding change in creeds. If the traditional creeds are doubted without any alternative, then the traditional authority relies more and more on the use of naked power. And where the traditional creeds are wholly replaced with alternative ones, traditional power <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> revolutionary power (Russell 1938:82).|$|E
5|$|Apollonius {{problem is}} to {{construct}} one or more circles tangent to three given objects in a plane, which may be circles, points, or lines. This <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> ten types of Apollonius' problem, one corresponding to each combination of circles, lines and points, which may be labeled with three letters, either C, L, or P, to denote whether the given elements are a circle, line or point, respectively (Table 1). As an example, the type of Apollonius problem with a given circle, line, and point is denoted as CLP.|$|E

50|$|According to Donovan et al (1981) the Stephanoceratidae and Otoitdae {{both have}} their {{origin in the}} Hildoceratoidea, in the Phymatoceratidae. The Otoitidae <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the Sphaeroceratidae which <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the Cardioceraticae, the Stephanoceratidae to the Kosmoceratidae, all within the Stephanoceratoidea. The Stephanoceratidae, accordingly, also <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the Perisphinctidae, root stock of the Perisphictoidea.|$|R
5|$|Arches 4 and 6 {{produce the}} {{laryngeal}} cartilages. The nerve {{of the sixth}} arch becomes the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The nerve of the fourth arch <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the superior laryngeal nerve. The arteries of the fourth arch, which project between the nerves of the fourth and sixth arches, become the left-sided arch of the aorta and the right subclavian artery. The arteries of the sixth arch persists as the ductus arteriosus on the left, and is obliterated on the right.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 18th century, some {{scientists}} had made correct hypotheses as to comets' physical composition. In 1755, Immanuel Kant hypothesized that comets are composed of some volatile substance, whose vaporization <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> their brilliant displays near perihelion. In 1836, the German mathematician Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel, after observing streams of vapor during the appearance of Halley's Comet in 1835, proposed that the jet forces of evaporating material could be great enough to significantly alter a comet's orbit, and {{he argued that the}} non-gravitational movements of Encke's Comet resulted from this phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|Cerium has a {{variable}} electronic structure. The {{energy of the}} 4f electron is nearly {{the same as that}} of the outer 5d and 6s electrons that are delocalized in the metallic state, and only a small amount of energy is required to change the relative occupancy of these electronic levels. This <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> dual valence states. For example, a volume change of about 10% occurs when cerium is subjected to high pressures or low temperatures. It appears that the valence changes from about 3 to 4 when it is cooled or compressed.|$|E
50|$|The Phylloceratina is {{the ancestral}} stock, {{derived from the}} Ceratitida {{near the end of}} the Triassic. The Phylloceratina <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the Lytoceratina near the {{beginning}} of the Jurassic which in turn <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the highly specialized Ancyloceratina {{near the end of the}} Jurassic.

5|$|Earlier than Stifel, the 8th century Jain {{mathematician}} Virasena {{is credited}} with a precursor to the binary logarithm. Virasena's concept of ardhacheda {{has been defined as}} the number of times a given number can be divided evenly by two. This definition <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> a function that coincides with the binary logarithm on the powers of two, but it is different for other integers, giving the 2-adic order rather than the logarithm.|$|E
5|$|Epigenetic {{changes in}} {{eukaryotic}} biology serve {{to regulate the}} process of cellular differentiation. During morphogenesis, totipotent stem cells become the various pluripotent cell lines of the embryo, which in turn become fully differentiated cells. A single fertilised egg cell, the zygote, <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the many different plant cell types including parenchyma, xylem vessel elements, phloem sieve tubes, guard cells of the epidermis, etc. as it continues to divide. The process results from the epigenetic activation of some genes and inhibition of others.|$|E
5|$|Telopea truncata is one, and {{possibly}} the most distinctive, of five species from southeastern Australia which make up the genus Telopea. It is the earliest offshoot of a lineage that <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the Gippsland waratah (T.oreades) and Monga waratah (T.mongaensis) of southeastern mainland Australia. The perianths of T.truncata are of a single shade of red, whereas those of its mainland relatives are coloured with two distinct shades of red—the surfaces facing {{the centre of the}} flower head are a much brighter red than those facing away.|$|E

5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease has}} been {{identified}} as a protein misfolding disease (proteopathy), caused by plaque accumulation of abnormally folded amyloid beta protein, and tau protein in the brain. Plaques are made up of small peptides, 39–43amino acids in length, called amyloid beta (Aβ). Aβ is a fragment from the larger amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is a transmembrane protein that penetrates through the neuron's membrane. APP is critical to neuron growth, survival, and post-injury repair. In Alzheimer's disease, gamma secretase and beta secretase act together in a proteolytic process which causes APP to be divided into smaller fragments. One of these fragments <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> fibrils of amyloid beta, which then form clumps that deposit outside neurons in dense formations known as senile plaques.|$|E
5|$|As a {{rotating}} proto-stellar disk contracts {{to form a}} star its shape {{becomes more and more}} spherical, but the contraction doesn't proceed all the way to a perfect sphere. At the poles all of the gravity acts to increase the contraction, but at the equator the effective gravity is diminished by the centrifugal force. The final shape of the star after star formation is an equilibrium shape, {{in the sense that the}} effective gravity in the equatorial region (being diminished) cannot pull the star to a more spherical shape. The rotation also <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> gravity darkening at the equator, as described by the von Zeipel theorem.|$|E
