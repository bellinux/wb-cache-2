According to Arab News, Muslims are forbidden to recycle, pulp, or shred worn-out copies of the text; instead, burning or burying the worn-out copies in a respectful manner is required.|$|E

5000|$|Knight {{prepared}} the company's play texts for production, adding stage directions, cues for offstage sounds, and other necessary information to turn an author's or scribe's manuscript into a promptbook. Several play manuscripts in Knight's hand survive [...] - [...] for Beggars' Bush, Bonduca, The Faithful Friends, and The Honest Man's Fortune. (Knight's manuscript for Bonduca {{is not a}} promptbook but a presentation MS. In the MSS. of both Bonduca and The Fautfhul Friends, Knight leaves gaps because he is transcribing the author's drafts, the [...] "foul papers," [...] and sometimes cannot read the <b>defective</b> <b>texts.)</b> Knight's job of annotating manuscripts for use as promptbooks throws light on practical aspects of the stagecraft of the era, and also the censorship problems that plagued the dramatists and actors. Philip Massinger's authorial MS. of his Believe as You List reveals official censorship in action, and bears notes and revisions in Knight's hand.|$|R
40|$|This Bachelor Thesis {{deals with}} the topic of written Czech {{language}} in the interactive communication of the Deaf. The theoretical part comprises chapters about the general specifics of the Deaf community, their characteristic communication features (intercultural, but primarily intra-cultural), the specifics of their written language and of their reading skills. Furthermore, the theoretical part covers topics such as interference from mother/first tongue and translation theory, as these are closely connected with inter- and intra-cultural communication of the Deaf. The practical part explores research on intra-cultural communication. Specifically, by exploring the question if Czech texts written by the Deaf have a function in intra-cultural communication of this language minority, {{and if they are}} comprehensible for the readers. The initial hypothesis is that the Deaf understand <b>defective</b> <b>texts</b> created by Deaf themselves better than grammatically correct texts written by Czech native speakers. The research describes and analyses intra-cultural communication through written Czech, it refers to specific problems which occur in this case and characterizes mistakes made by participants in the communication process. Finally, the conclusion of the thesis evaluates the suitability of using written Czech in [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Textual {{information}} or data annotated with textual information (meta-information) are regular targets of securing or confiscating relevant {{material in the}} field of criminal proceedings. In general evaluation of relevant material is complex, especially the manual (re) search in the increasing amount of data as a result of cheaper storage capacity available nowadays therefore the identification of valid relations are enormously complex, error-prone and slow. In addition, the adherence to time limits and data privacy protection make searching even more difficult. The development of an (semi-) automatic high modular solution for exploration of this kind of data using capabilities of computer linguistic methods and technologies is presented in this work. From a scientific perspective, the biggest challenge is the au-tomatic handling of fragmented or <b>defective</b> <b>texts</b> and hidden semantics. A domain-specific language has been defined using the model-driven approach of the Eclipse Modeling Framework for the purpose of developing forensic taxonomies and ontologies. Based on this, role-based editors have been developed to allow the definition of case-based ontologies and taxonomies and the results of manual annotation of texts. The next steps required for further development are going to include comparison of several back-end frameworks, e. g., for indexing, information extraction, querying and the providing of a graphical representation of relations as a knowledge map. Finally, the overall process needs to be optimized and automated. Keywords—forensic; ontology; taxonomy; querying; framework. I...|$|R

40|$|Thema der gegenständlichen Masterarbeit ist eine Übersetzungskritik der deutschen Übersetzung des Romans von Benno Weiser Varon Yo era europeo. Die Kritik folgt dem funktionalen Modell nach Margret Ammann. Im theoreti-schen Teil der Arbeit wird ein Überblick über die Ansätze der modernen Überset-zungswissenschaft gegeben und deren Erkenntnisse in den Descriptive Translation Studies, in der Hermeneutik und in der allgemeinen funktionalen Translationsthe-orie, die in der Folge näher dargestellt werden. Das von Margret Ammann entwickelte funktionale Modell der Übersetzungskritik geht von der Skopostheo-rie, dem Modell für eine Übersetzungskritik von Hans J. Vermeer und von J. Holz-Mänttäris Theorie vom translatorischen Handeln aus und wendet die Scenes-and-frames Semantik und Umberto Ecos Idee des Modell-Lesers an. Anhand der fünf Kritikschritte werden ausgewählte Textbeispiele analysiert, wobei zuerst die Funktion und die intratextuelle Kohärenz des Translats und dann jene des Aus-gangstextes behandelt werden. Abschließend werden beide Texte auf ihre Kohä-renz geprüft. Bei der Analyse stellte sich heraus, dass das Original des Autors durch die Übersetzer stilistisch verbessert wurde, dass es jedoch auf Grund des defekten Ausgangstextes teilweise zu grotesken Übersetzungslösungen kam, die den Lektoren nicht zu denken gaben und die hymnischen Stimmen der Rezensen-ten nicht trüben konnten. The subject {{addressed}} by this Master’s thesis is {{a critique of}} the German translation of Benno Weiser Varon’s autobiographical novel Ich war Europäer/Yo era europeo, for which Margret Ammann’s functional model was used. The theo-retical part of the paper presents, in the chapters Descriptive Translation Studies, Hermeneutics, and Functional Theory of Translation, an overview of the ap-proaches and findings of modern translation studies, which are subsequently ex-amined in more detail. Margret Ammann’s functional model of translation critique is based on the skopos theory, on Hans J. Vermeer’s model of translation critique and on J. Holz-Mänttäri’s theory of translatorial action, employing scenes-and-frames semantics and Umberto Eco’s notion of a model reader. Using the five-step method, selected text extracts were analysed, firstly to examine the function and intratextual coherence of the translation and, subsequently, that of the source text. Both texts were then reviewed for their coherence. The analysis revealed that, although the translators had stylistically improved the author’s original, the <b>defective</b> source <b>text</b> led to some absurd translation errors which, however, did not appear to disturb the editor or to diminish the glowing praise of the reviews...|$|R
