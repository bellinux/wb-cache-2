5|$|The {{southern}} terminus of I-35E is at exit 88A in Burnsville, where I-35 splits into I-35E and I-35W. While I-35W heads {{north into}} Minneapolis, I-35E takes a northeasterly path into Saint Paul. There is no access between I-35E and I-35W here, but <b>Dakota</b> <b>County</b> Road 42 (exit 88B), {{immediately to the}} north, connects the two Interstates in Burnsville. Major interchanges south of Saint Paul include State Highway 77 (MN77, signed as Cedar Avenue—exit92) at Apple Valley– Eagan and Interstate 494 (exit99) in Mendota Heights. Between exits94 and 97, the highway deviates from its relatively straight path to avoid Blackhawk Lake. As it crosses I-494, I-35E turns more to the north, crossing MN110 (exit101) and MN13 (exit102) in Mendota Heights before crossing the Mississippi River on the Lexington Bridge into the city of Saint Paul. This portion of I-35E is four lanes wide (two in each direction), except between MN77 and MN110, where it carries six lanes. The Lexington Bridge carries six lanes—four through lanes and the exit and entrance lanes for MN13—as well as a bicycle and pedestrian path. The bridge has an innovative automatic anti-icing system that sprays potassium acetate onto the bridge surface to prevent frost and ice formation in inclement weather.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} settlers were roughly 250 Mdewakanton Dakota {{who lived}} permanently at Black Dog camp. Starting in the 1850s, Old stock Americans {{from the east}} coast and French Canadians moved into eastern <b>Dakota</b> <b>County</b> near Saint Paul. A decade later, major European immigration began with settlers from Ireland, Scotland, and Great Britain. By the 1900s {{there were a few}} Scandinavians from Sweden, Norway, and Denmark but these ethnic groups were mostly concentrated towards Lakeville. Those from Germany and Eastern Europe would gradually join the minority from the packing jobs in nearby South St. Paul. Irish descendants maintained the majority through the early 1950s owing to the town's origin, overall land ownership, and the practice of marrying within ethnic clans. The early 20th century's permanent population remained very low as the Minnesota River's lack of bridges and streetcar connection isolated the area from development, preventing people from moving south of the river. The lake-side houses around Crystal Lake and Orchard Lake however attracted several various immigrant and first-generation wealthier individuals to temporarily settle or own land in the town limits.|$|E

500|$|The stadium's cost totals $288.5million, {{of which}} the {{university}} will pay 52% {{and the state of}} Minnesota the remaining 48%. Including interest the state's cost is about $10 million per year or about $1.7 million per game for 25 years. About $50 million of the state's portion goes to the purchase of 2,840acres (11.5km²) of undeveloped university land, part of the Rosemount Research Center in <b>Dakota</b> <b>County,</b> over 25 years by the state of Minnesota who will assume responsibility for risks if the site requires environmental cleanup.

500|$|During the {{remainder}} of 2005 the university concentrated on drafting a stadium proposal that would draw the support of state politicians. [...] The final plan proposed {{that the state of}} Minnesota would contribute 40% of the stadium cost while the university would raise the remaining 60% on its own. [...] Portions of that 60% were to be funded by the TCF naming rights, while {{the remainder}} would come from a $50 per semester student fee, private donations, the sale of 2,840acres (11.5km²) of university land in rural <b>Dakota</b> <b>County</b> back to the state, and game day parking revenue. [...] Even though the university proposal drew widespread legislative support, the stadium effort suffered a setback when the 2005 legislative session ended before the stadium bill could be heard. Late in 2005 when it became evident that this would happen, the university and TCF Bank announced that it had extended the naming rights deal to June 30, 2006.|$|E
