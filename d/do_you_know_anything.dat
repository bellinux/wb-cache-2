60|$|<b>DO</b> <b>YOU</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> of {{a people}} {{in the north of}} this country, called the Ansarey?' inquired Tancred of Baroni.|$|E
6000|$|She {{laughed a}} rather shrill laugh. 'You're a courtier already. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> of dances, wench--or Queen, must I say?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Our curate's wife!' cried he with a start; 'how was it? Florence, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything?</b> I {{thought she}} was in London. Why were we in the dark? Tell me all.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ain't you my chile? En <b>does</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> dat {{a mother}} won't {{do for her}} chile? Day ain't nothin' a white mother won't do for her chile. Who made 'em so? De Lord done it. En who made de niggers? De Lord made 'em. In de inside, mothers is all de same. De good lord he made 'em so. I's gwine to be sole into slavery, en in a year you's gwine to buy yo' ole mammy free ag'in. I'll show you how. Dat's de plan." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She is kind; kinder than I {{can tell}} you just at present. But <b>did</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> so bitter as she is to the poor bishop? And really the bishop is not so bad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{generally}} do guess {{as much as}} that, when young gentlemen find young ladies divine. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> about Miss Dormer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So are you--to-morrow, by {{the first}} train. I wonder how soon we can get married. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> about special licenses?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then, Mr. White, I cannot help {{believing that}} the family here never heard of it. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> of that young man?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must take}} the risk of that, Lady Delahaye," [...] I answered. [...] "I ask you to remember, however, that the law would also require you to prove your guardianship. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> {{yourself}} <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> of the child's parentage?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was very}} lucky {{at a small}} steeplechase," [...] he said. [...] "Backed a rank {{outsider}} {{that only a few}} friends of mine believed in. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> of <b>anything</b> that's bound to go up on the Stock Exchange? It's in your line, I think." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was Aunt Josephine," [...] said Diana, gasping with laughter. [...] "Oh, Anne, it was Aunt Josephine, however {{she came}} to be there. Oh, and I know she will be furious. It's dreadful--it's really dreadful--but <b>did</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> so funny, Anne?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good! Good!" [...] whispered Lingard, excitedly, off {{his guard}} for once. Then--"How the devil <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> about it?" [...] he asked.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, that is it," [...] Helen {{answered}} quietly, {{but with}} deep intensity. [...] "Can he be saved? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything?</b> Can you help?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She was {{corresponding}} with another! I {{dare say}} she was; {{with half a}} dozen at once. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> about it, Miss Gaunt?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{turned out}} of the way,' said I, in explanation, 'to look at that odd post-chaise. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> happen to <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> about it?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What is that? <b>You</b> <b>do</b> not <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> {{about the}} big snowball that just came hurtling down these stairs?" [...] stormed Professor Duke.|$|R
6000|$|... “Better than I expected. The boy has {{the right}} grip and he’s taking hold.” Clay turned {{abruptly}} and fixed Osborne with his eyes. “I was a bit puzzled about his making up his mind all at once that he’d run the mill. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> of <b>anything</b> that might have helped to persuade him?” ...|$|R
6000|$|What about Harper's Ferry? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> about it? How {{certain is}} your {{information}} about Bragg {{being in the}} valley of the Shenandoah? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "From the Old Country," [...] he {{said with}} a laugh, [...] "and a bit high-handed, but there's sand in him. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> about Allenwood?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, for you; <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> {{about the}} negro, {{apparently}} a cripple, aboard here? Is he, {{or is he}} not, what he seems to be?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> {{come here}} instead of Gardiner; and how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> there is <b>anything</b> {{for you to}} trouble about?" [...] I asked, and the {{sergeant}} showed a trace of impatience.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, {{that was}} what Pilgrim said, and so I didn't go round to Mrs. Raynor's. He {{said it would be}} all the better if Mrs. Dempster could be kept out of the house for the present. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> if <b>anything</b> new has {{happened}} between Dempster and his wife lately? I was surprised to hear of her being at Paddiford Church this morning.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, there isn't; and I shall {{think you}} don't mean {{anything}} at all if you keep on. Now, tell me how she really impressed <b>you.</b> <b>Does</b> she <b>know</b> <b>anything?</b> Has she read anything? Has she any ideas?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When they do, haven't {{they usually}} {{to sell it}} for almost nothing to {{somebody}} who gets up a company? Besides, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> about prospecting?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, dearest friend, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> about it? that is {{the very}} {{question}} I want to ask you. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> about it? Sometimes I have thought you knew nothing. And then sometimes I have thought, been bold enough to think--" [...] And Sir Lionel looked intently at the handkerchief which covered her face; and Miss Todd looked furtively, ever and anon, at Sir Lionel.

6000|$|... "And <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> of my brother?" [...] {{he asked}} eagerly. [...] "He {{is a young}} sailor from the Olympia, and his name is Larry Russell." ...|$|E
6000|$|Eleanor {{looked at}} him with a chilly smile. [...] "You have a certain penetration, but I don't know that there is any reason why I should confess to <b>you.</b> How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> come to <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> about Mr. Merril?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Beware, then, {{of finding}} {{yourself}} confronted with doubt and despair! I {{am sure that}} doubt, at times, and the bitterness that comes of it, can be terribly eloquent. To tell the truth, my lonely musings, before you came in, were eloquent enough, in their way. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> of <b>anything</b> but this strange, terrible world that surrounds <b>you?</b> How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that your faith is not a mere crazy castle in the air; one of those castles that we are called fools for building when we lodge them in this life?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} it is all as you think; more {{especially}} as there are several allusions to a certain Harry Beekman in her letters, at which I should feel flattered, were I in Mr. Harry's place. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> happen to <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> of such a family as the Beekmans, sir?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Alton. [...] "I {{am going}} to stop right where I am until there's light enough to trail them by. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> better, Tom?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mary blushed, {{and looked}} at Mr Whittlestaff. But he took upon himself the task of {{answering}} the clergyman's remarks. [...] "But how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> about Miss Lawrie?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{should she}} {{not do it}} as well?" [...] said Thurnall. [...] "Mrs. Barker, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> of a person named Briggs--John Briggs, the apothecary's son, at Whitbury?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{want you}} to answer me," [...] she said, [...] "it is not too late. Shall I give up Bathilde--and the stage? Listen! <b>You</b> <b>do</b> not <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> of my circumstances. I am not {{dependent}} upon either the stage or my writing for a living. I ask you for your honest advice. Shall I give it up?" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Do</b> <b>you</b> {{happen to}} <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> about Judith yourself, {{except that she}} cut off Holofernes' head; and has been made the high light of about a million of vile {{pictures}} ever since, in which the painters thought they could surely attract the public to the double show of an execution, and a pretty woman,--especially with the added pleasure of hinting at previously ignoble sin? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gwendoline Gildersleeve," [...] {{his father}} echoed, astonished; {{for there was}} feud between the families, [...] "That rascally, land-grabbing barrister's daughter! Why, how on earth <b>do</b> <b>you</b> come to <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> of her, Granville? Nobody in Surrey ever had the {{impertinence}} yet to ask me or mine to meet the Gildersleeves anywhere, since that disgraceful behaviour of his about the boundary fences. And I didn't suppose you'd ever even seen her." ...|$|R
