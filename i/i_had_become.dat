In {{the interview that}} followed he told me what he wanted, and what the failures and his disappointments had been, and proceeded to advise me as to what I should do to accomplish the purpose determined upon {{in the way of}} the new coinage. In this talk he suggested some details of action of a drastic character for my guidance, which he was positive were necessary to be adopted before success could be had. All this was delivered in his usual vigorous way, emphasizing many points by hammering on the desk with his fist.|$|E

By {{the time of}} Edmund and Edward's arrival at his court, Stephen was married to Gisela of Bavaria and had led a {{peaceful}} reign. The Hungarian court was [...] "a happy home" [...] for the exiled English princes. However, in 1028, Edmund and Edward were forced to flee Hungary after Cnut sent powerful assassins {{to carry out the}} task of murdering the two Æthelings. The princes found refuge at the court of Yaroslav the Wise, Grand Prince of Kiev.|$|E
500|$|Prost won {{the first}} two Grands Prix of the 1982 season in South Africa, where Prost {{recovered}} from losing a wheel, and Brazil, where he finished 3rd but was awarded the win after Piquet (1st) and Keke Rosberg (2nd) were disqualified. He finished in the points on four other occasions, but did not win again. Despite retiring from seven races, Prost improved on his Drivers' Championship position, finishing in fourth, but with nine fewer points than the previous year. His relationship with Arnoux deteriorated further after the French Grand Prix. Prost believes that Arnoux, who won the race, went back on a pre-race agreement to support Prost during the race. His relationship with the French media was also poor. He has since commented that [...] "When I went to Renault the journalists wrote good things about me, but by 1982 <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> the bad guy. I think, to be honest, I had {{made the mistake of}} winning! The French don't really like winners." ...|$|E

500|$|On June 6, 1990, {{recording}} for Off the Deep End officially {{began at}} Santa Monica Sound Records, in Santa Monica, California. The first recording session started with [...] "Airline Amy". These recording sessions {{marked the first}} time Yankovic self-produced his songs, after six albums with Rick Derringer. [...] The producer and musician had parted ways because Derringer found that Yankovic would not listen to his input, and Yankovic came to realize that he could do most of the production work himself. Subsequent studio albums would be produced by Yankovic. In regards to this split, Yankovic said: [...] "We [...] had a great run with Rick, he’s a terrific guybut <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> more and more of a control freak over the years, and I’d finally gotten to the point in my recording career where I felt that I could capably hold the reins all by myself." [...] By late 1990 five originals—"Airline Amy," [...] "Trigger Happy", [...] "When I Was Your Age", [...] "You Don't Love Me Anymore," [...] and [...] "Waffle King"—were recorded.|$|E
500|$|Interviewed by Oriana Fallaci in 1965, Connery {{identified}} {{where he}} had altered the character for the films, saying [...] "I said to the producers that the character had one defect, there was no humor about him; to get him accepted, they'd have to let me play him tongue-in-cheek, so people could laugh. They agreed, and there you are: today Bond is accepted {{to such an extent}} that even philosophers take the trouble to analyze him, even intellectuals enjoy defending him or attacking him. And even while they're laughing at him, people take him terribly seriously". Connery went on to add that [...] "Bond is important: this invincible superman that every man would like to copy, that every woman would like to conquer, this dream we all have of survival. And then one can't help liking him". After the pressures of five films in six years, Connery left the role after the 1967 film You Only Live Twice saying, [...] "It became a terrible pressure, like living in a goldfish bowl... that was part of the reason I wanted to be finished with Bond. Also <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> completely identified with it, and it became very wearing and very boring".|$|E
500|$|Leonardo died at Clos Lucé, on 2 May 1519 {{at the age}} of 67. The {{cause is}} {{generally}} stated to be recurrent stroke; this diagnosis is consistent with accounts of the state of Leonardo's alleged remains as described in 1863 [...] Francis <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> a close friend. Vasari records that the king held Leonardo's head in his arms as he died, although this story, beloved by the French and portrayed in romantic paintings by Ingres, [...] and other French artists, as well as by Angelica Kauffman, may be legend rather than fact. Vasari states that in his last days, Leonardo sent for a priest to make his confession and to receive the Holy Sacrament. In accordance with his will, sixty beggars followed his casket. Melzi was the principal heir and executor, receiving, as well as money, Leonardo's paintings, tools, library and personal effects. Leonardo also remembered his other long-time pupil and companion, Salai, and his servant Battista di Vilussis, who each received half of Leonardo's vineyards. His brothers received land, and his serving woman received a black cloak [...] "of good stuff" [...] with a fur edge. Leonardo da Vinci was buried in the Chapel of Saint-Hubert in Château d'Amboise in France.|$|E

2500|$|... "For me, 1960 or thereabouts {{was a time}} to {{take another}} look at the {{philosophy}} and art of the Orient--particularly Japanese art--that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> familiar with in my youth. Through my travels and my studies of traditional Japanese arts I was able to reaffirm my conviction in the Oriental view of nature which sees man as one part of nature, a part that must live in harmony with the rest of nature. From 1960 on, I attempted to express this relationship between man and nature in my works. My sumi-e drawings are a direct response to nature; my fountain sculptures are an attempt to unify water--the life force of the universe that flows in an elusive cyclical course throughout eternity--with an immutable metal sculpture."—George Tsutakawa ...|$|E

He said he lost [...] from his previously overweight body, {{as a result of}} the healthy, hard physical labour he performed there. He spent time traveling around the country, with time scuba diving at the Red Sea port city of Eilat, and began to reconsider his future: [...] "I wondered again, as I had wondered when I first went to Oxford, whether I really wanted to become a doctor. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> very interested in neurophysiology, but I also loved marine biology; [...] [...] [...] But I was 'cured' now; it was time to return to medicine, to start clinical work, seeing patients in London." ...|$|E

In a 2005 interview with Kerrang, he reflected on his self-destructive past: [...] "There was a persona that had run its course. I {{needed to get}} my priorities straight, my head screwed on. Instead of always working, I {{took a couple of}} years off, just to figure out who I was and working out if I wanted to keep doing this or not. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> a terrible addict; I needed to get my shit together, figure out what had happened." [...] In contrast to his former suicidal tendencies, he admitted in another interview that he is [...] "pretty happy".

[...] He surprised me, he said - [...] "I got married to your music. This is why I've called you." [...] I was quite amazed, he called me because he had my music at his wedding. Then when he showed me the film, later when I wrote the music, we didn't exchange ideas. He ran away, nearly ashamed of showing it to me. I wrote the music on my own without his advice. Naturally, as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> quite clever since 1982, I've written several scores relating to my life. And I had written one, which was electronic music. And [...] took the electronic score.|$|E

Regarding the performance, IU recalled the crowd had hurled insults at her and though she felt discouraged by it, she now considers it a beneficial experience. [...] "Lost Child" [...] is the lead single from her debut extended play Lost and Found, which was released on September 24, 2008. For the album, IU was awarded the [...] "Rookie of the Month" [...] by South Korea's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism in November 2008. However, the album did not do well commercially. During an interview in 2011, IU said, [...] "My first album failed, but I'm grateful for that.

2500|$|Judt won a {{place at}} Emanuel School in Wandsworth, and {{following}} his education at Emanuel, {{he went on to}} study as a scholarship student at King's College, Cambridge. Judt was the first member of his family to finish secondary school and to go to university. While at Cambridge, Judt became close friends with Martyn Poliakoff, who later became well known as a chemist and star of the Periodic Table of Videos. He obtained a BA degree in history in 1969 and after spending a year at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris completed a Ph.D. in 1972. As a high school and university student he was a left-wing Zionist, and worked summers on kibbutzim. He moved away from Zionism after the Six-Day War of 1967, later stating that [...] "I went with this idealistic fantasy of creating a socialist, communitarian country", but that he came to realise that left-wing Zionists were [...] "remarkably unconscious of the people who had been kicked out of the country...to make this fantasy possible". He came to describe his Zionism as his particular [...] "ideological overinvestment". Judt wrote in February 2010 that: [...] "Before even turning twenty <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>become,</b> been, and ceased to be a Zionist, a Marxist, and a communitarian settler: no mean achievement for a south London teenager".|$|E
