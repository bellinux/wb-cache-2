5|$|Near its <b>epicenter,</b> the 1916 Irondale {{earthquake}} produced intensities measuring VI (Strong) and VII (Very strong) on the Mercalli intensity scale. Further away, its intensities {{ranged from}} III (Weak) to IV (Light).|$|E
5|$|Using {{a similar}} strategy, S. D. Malone and S. Bor {{analyzed}} the known intensities for the 1872 shock, then compared intensity patterns {{for a number}} of instrumentally recorded earthquakes that also occurred in the Pacific Northwest. A factor that was taken into consideration was that for earthquakes that have either circular or slightly elliptical isoseismal maps, the <b>epicenter</b> is usually close {{to the center of the}} pattern, but that for shocks where instrumental information are also available, the <b>epicenter</b> is sometimes not where it would have been assumed to be, had only the intensity information (and no instrumental information) been available. An isoseismal map of the 1949 Olympia earthquake was presented as an example of a distorted or convoluted pattern that was attributed to local geological conditions that either attenuated or amplified the seismic waves, and it was emphasized that not taking into account these local features could lead to a misinterpretation of the felt intensities and to a misplaced <b>epicenter.</b>|$|E
5|$|When {{a second}} {{simultaneous}} set of earthquakes occur, the parallel universe's version of Nick Lane (David Call) approaches Agent Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel) {{of the prime}} universe, believing {{him to be the}} parallel universe's version of Lee. Lee feigns familiarity, learning that Nick had visions of being at the <b>epicenter</b> of the quake before it began. When Lee reports this to Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) in the prime universe, she suddenly recalls her Cortexiphan trials including fellow subject Nick Lane, and with the team's help, identifies that other Cortexiphan subjects are the <b>epicenter</b> of these quakes, linking to their parallel universe versions to achieve synchronization.|$|E
30|$|<b>Epicenters</b> within Anomaly 3 {{are located}} near the {{asperity}} ruptured by the 2008 Ibaraki-oki main shock. <b>Epicenters</b> within Anomalies 1 and 2 are located west of the focal area of the 2008 Ibaraki-oki main shock (Fig. 7 (a)). The depth of hypocenters is systematically increasing westward from Anomalies 3 to 1 along the subducting Pacific plate (Fig. 7 (b)).|$|R
30|$|Figure 2 {{illustrates}} the distributions of relocated hypocenters at depths shallower than 12 km. The epicentral distributions are fairly heterogeneous along the seismic sequence (Fig. 2 (a)): {{from the center}} to the south (E-F, G-H), the <b>epicenters</b> exhibit relatively wide distributions, whereas the <b>epicenters</b> from the center to the north (A-B, C-D) are tightly oriented in a N-S direction.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{relatively}} strong ground motions, {{damage to}} the area was very limited; structures around the <b>epicenter</b> were a mix of fairly vulnerable and resistant to earthquake shaking. Buildings swayed with the tremor in Mexico City, causing panic among many citizens and prompting some to evacuate. Several schools in Guerrero were evacuated as a safety precaution. The earthquake and its aftershock sequence contributed to intermittent power outages in Acapulco; more than 40,000 residences in some 40 districts remained without power by the next day. There were no reports of major losses or fatalities {{in the wake of}} the tremor, though two police stations located in Acapulco and Marquelia suffered light damage. Elsewhere, some fallen roof tiles and small landslides occurred east of the <b>epicenter</b> in Cuautepec.|$|E
5|$|The 1980s saw a {{rebirth of}} Wall Street, and Manhattan {{reclaimed}} its {{role at the}} center of the worldwide financial industry. The 1980s also saw Manhattan at the heart of the AIDS crisis, with Greenwich Village at its <b>epicenter.</b> The organizations Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC) and AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) were founded to advocate on behalf of those stricken with the disease.|$|E
5|$|The earthquake's <b>epicenter</b> {{was within}} the village of Ardekul in South Khorasan Province, which borders Afghanistan. The village is {{isolated}} between mountains and hills. Although the Iranian government had distributed more than 800 seismographs throughout the country, few {{had been placed in}} the Qayen region due to its desert climate and the remoteness of the area.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} the {{difference}} in distributions between larger and smaller after-shocks that followed some large earthquakes with magnitude larger than 7 at trenches of thePacific Ocean. By a method similar to the t-test, it seems probable that the <b>epicenters</b> ofthe smaller shocks are located slightly landward in comparison {{with those of the}} larger shocks,especially in South Kuril and Philippine. On the statistic basis mentioned above, <b>epicenters</b> of the main shocks are compared withthose of their aftershocks. It is ascertained that most of <b>epicenters</b> of the main shocks withreversal dip-slip fault are situated iandward, except the events in New Britain Trench andNew Hebrides...|$|R
30|$|An RI-type model {{based on}} a non-declustered catalog may {{overestimate}} future seismicity rates near the <b>epicenters</b> of large earthquakes in the past, because aftershocks that dominate seismicity near those <b>epicenters</b> {{are included in the}} forecast generation. Declustering earthquake catalogs for use in RI-type forecasts is a challenging subject because, as discussed in Section 4, no clear-cut and authorized definition of aftershocks has so far been agreed upon.|$|R

5|$|The entire {{colonnade}} of {{the temple}} collapsed in a devastating June 4, 1679 earthquake, the <b>epicenter</b> of which was, according to many scholars, located in gorge of Garni. Most of the original building blocks remained scattered at the site, allowing the building to be reconstructed.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} {{distance between}} the two civilizations has also been {{used to assess the}} cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact. Historical examples show that the greater the distance, the less the contacted civilization perceives a threat to itself and its culture. Therefore, contact occurring within the Solar System, and especially in the immediate vicinity of Earth, {{is likely to be the}} most disruptive and negative for humanity. On a smaller scale, people close to the <b>epicenter</b> of contact would experience a greater effect than would those living farther away, and a contact having multiple epicenters would cause a greater shock than one with a single <b>epicenter.</b> Space scientists Martin Dominik and John Zarnecki state that in the absence of any data on the nature of extraterrestrial intelligence, one must predict the cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact on the basis of generalizations encompassing all life and of analogies with history.|$|E
5|$|After Jones makes another {{unsuccessful}} {{attempt to}} open a doorway at a soccer field in Providence, Olivia searches through old case files related to science and unexplained phenomena, and discovers a geographic connection between the soccer field, the city street, and several of their past Fringe cases. Olivia and Walter {{come to the same}} conclusion, that Jones is going to use a site at Reiden Lake to reopen the doorway, the <b>epicenter</b> of these Fringe events. Olivia, Peter, and Walter intercept Jones while he is opening another window and is halfway through it. Peter triggers Walter's device, killing Jones by sealing the doorway.|$|E

5|$|By 6May, a {{total of}} five light {{aftershocks}} had occurred near the earthquake's <b>epicenter.</b> Of the five, the first registered a magnitude of 3.7(ML) and struck about 15 minutes after the main shock, and was succeeded by a magnitude 3.9(ML) tremor at 10:09 local time. Two similar quakes of minor intensity struck the region the next day; however, the strongest and final aftershock registered a magnitude of 4.1(ML) and occurred at 04:00 in the morning.|$|E
5|$|Ethan Gutmann, citing Falun Gong {{allegations}} that Liaoning was the <b>epicenter</b> of organ harvesting from practitioners while Bo was governor, {{suggested that he}} may have used his involvement as a way of building up his political power. David Kilgour, who co-wrote the Kilgour–Matas report on organ harvesting, accused Bo of playing a role. Separately, Falun Gong practitioners abroad filed over ten lawsuits against Bo alleging torture and crimes against humanity In 2009, a Spanish court indicted Bo Xilai and four other officials for genocide against Falun Gong.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} its number of openly gay politicians, gay wedding ceremonies, pride events and gay-inclusive {{religious}} organizations relative {{to the size of}} the total population of the city, Minneapolis has one of the largest LGBT populations in the U.S. Noted for its strong music and performing arts scenes, Minneapolis is home to both the award-winning Guthrie Theater and the historic First Avenue nightclub. Reflecting the region's status as an <b>epicenter</b> of folk, funk, and alternative rock music, the city served as the launching pad for several of the 20th century's most influential musicians, including Bob Dylan and Prince.|$|E
30|$|Two {{outlying}} areas appear from the D 4 level down, bordering the high damaged central zone {{to the west}} and east. Each of these areas is the closest to one of the two <b>epicenters</b> so, most probably, these municipalities were hit mainly by one of the two earthquakes, and their buildings have suffered a higher damage compared {{to other parts of the}} territory, but they are less affected than those areas between the two <b>epicenters.</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} spatial {{clustering}} of earthquake <b>epicenters</b> using statistical depth. Data are spatial coordinates of Italian earthquake <b>epicenters</b> {{recorded in the}} period 1600 [...] 2003 with magnitude greater than $ 4. 5 $ $M_w$. In general, data depth provides a centrality ordering according to a reference data set or probability distribution. In the present application, the depth value of a particular location {{with respect to the}} spatial distribution of <b>epicenters</b> is interpreted as a measure of seismic risk, i. e., deeper locations have higher risks. Hence, depth contours describe the risk profile of a territory. Both global and local depth functions are used, the former defining a monotonic ranking of the locations covered by the catalogue, the latter aimed at a more flexible ranking, possibly with multiple centers...|$|R
5|$|On January 12, 2010, Haiti {{was struck}} by a magnitude-7.0 {{earthquake}}, the country's most severe earthquake in over 200 years. The <b>epicenter</b> of the quake was just outside the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince. Over 230,000 civilians have been confirmed dead by the Haitian government because of the disaster and around 300,000 have been injured. Approximately 1.2 million people are homeless and {{it has been reported that}} the lack of temporary shelter may lead to the outbreak of disease.|$|E
5|$|On July 29, 1967, McCain was a {{lieutenant}} commander {{when he was}} near the <b>epicenter</b> of the USS Forrestal fire. He escaped from his burning jet {{and was trying to}} help another pilot escape when a bomb exploded; McCain was struck in the legs and chest by fragments. The ensuing fire killed 134sailors and took 24hours to control. With the Forrestal out of commission, McCain volunteered for assignment with the , another aircraft carrier employed in Operation Rolling Thunder. Once there, he would be awarded the Navy Commendation Medal and the Bronze Star Medal for missions flown over North Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Presidents Hall– One of {{the oldest}} {{buildings}} on campus and a flagship of the University, Presidents Hall was completed in 1867.
