25|$|MEG signals {{were first}} {{measured}} by University of Illinois physicist David Cohen in 1968, before {{the availability of}} the SQUID, using a copper <b>induction</b> <b>coil</b> as the detector. To reduce the magnetic background noise, the measurements were made in a magnetically shielded room. The coil detector was barely sensitive enough, resulting in poor, noisy MEG measurements that were difficult to use. Later, Cohen built a better shielded room at MIT, and used one of the first SQUID detectors, just developed by James E. Zimmerman, a researcher at Ford Motor Company, to again measure MEG signals. This time the signals were almost as clear as those of EEG. This stimulated the interest of physicists who had been looking for uses of SQUIDs. Subsequent to this, various types of spontaneous and evoked MEGs began to be measured.|$|E
25|$|Dynamic {{microphones}} use {{the same}} dynamic principle as in a loudspeaker, only reversed. A small movable <b>induction</b> <b>coil,</b> positioned in the magnetic field of a permanent magnet, {{is attached to the}} diaphragm. When sound enters through the windscreen of the microphone, the sound wave moves the diaphragm. When the diaphragm vibrates, the coil moves in the magnetic field, producing a varying current in the coil through electromagnetic induction. A single dynamic membrane does not respond linearly to all audio frequencies. For this reason some microphones utilize multiple membranes for the different parts of the audio spectrum and then combine the resulting signals. Combining the multiple signals correctly is difficult and designs that do this are rare and tend to be expensive. On the other hand, there are several designs that are more specifically aimed towards isolated parts of the audio spectrum. The AKG D 112, for example, is designed for bass response rather than treble. In audio engineering several kinds of microphones are often used {{at the same time to}} get the best results.|$|E

500|$|Three {{classes of}} {{electrotherapy}} were in use.

[...] This consisted of bringing a negative electrode close to the patient, usually near the spine, causing sparks to be produced between the electrode and the patient. [...] Electrodes of various shapes were available for different medical purposes and places of application on the body. [...] Treatment was applied in several sessions of around five minutes, often blistering the skin. [...] The third class of treatment was electric shock therapy, in which an electric shock was delivered from a galvanic battery (later electromagnetic generators) via an <b>induction</b> <b>coil</b> to greatly increase the voltage.

500|$|A special link {{could be}} {{included}} in the chain which incorporated an interrupter circuit. [...] The purpose of the interrupter is to rapidly connect and disconnect the circuit so that the normally steady current of the battery is turned into a rapidly varying current. [...] The usual practice in the use of medical electrical batteries was to feed the output of the interrupter to an <b>induction</b> <b>coil</b> in order to increase the voltage applied to the patient by transformer action. [...] In Pulvermacher's patent however, {{there is no mention of}} using induction coils - the Pulvermacher battery could produce large voltages merely by adding more links to the chain. [...] However, the interrupter still had an effect in that an interrupted current produces a stronger sensation of electric shock in the patient than a steady current. [...] A novel feature of Pulvermacher's interrupter was that it was operated by the action of a vibrating spring kept in motion by the movements of the patient without the need for any external input. [...] Interrupters of the time typically had to be hand-cranked by the physician, although there were already some in existence using electro-mechanical automatic interrupters. [...] Later versions of the Pulvermacher chain used clockwork driven interrupters whose rate of interruption could be adjusted so that the rate of shock to the patient could be controlled. [...] Such a clockwork interrupter is fitted to the chain shown in figure 1. [...] It is wound up by turning the handle at the left end.Pulvermacher, p.2 ...|$|E

30|$|Magneto-tellurics (MT) is a geoelectrical {{sounding}} {{method used}} for estimating resistivity structure {{on the basis}} of electromagnetic induction (e.g., Cagniard, 1953; Vozoff, 1991; Simpson and Bahr, 2005). For the present study, AMT (Audio Magneto-tellurics) and MT surveys were conducted in November 2008, and July and August 2009 on the Unzen volcanic massif, using Phoenix Geophysics MTU- 5 system. The observation points, shown in Fig. 1, were configured in a N-S direction across the summit of Unzen volcano. Four Pb-PbCl 2 electrodes were used for measuring two orthogonal components of electric fields (N-S and E-W directions), and one additional electrode was used for grounding. Three orthogonal components of magnetic field (N-S, E-W, and vertical directions) were measured using three <b>induction</b> <b>coils,</b> which consist of a coil of copper wire wound on a core with high magnetic permeability. Data were collected in the frequency range between 1 Hz and 10 kHz. For the relatively high frequency range between 100 Hz and 10 kHz, AMT <b>induction</b> <b>coils</b> were used, and each observation point continued data acquisition for four hours. For the relatively low frequency range between 1 Hz and 100 Hz, MT <b>induction</b> <b>coils</b> were used, and each observation point continued data acquisition for one week. To remove contamination in the data due to local noise, we applied Gamble et al.’s (1979) remote reference processing method using geomagnetic data from Sawauchi (1000 km from Unzen). For the data obtained with the AMT <b>induction</b> <b>coils,</b> we performed mutual referencing within the survey area.|$|R
2500|$|In the US William Stanley, Jr. {{designed}} one of {{the first}} practical devices to transfer AC power efficiently between isolated circuits. Using pairs of coils wound on a common iron core, his design, called an <b>induction</b> <b>coil,</b> was an early (1885) transformer. Stanley also worked on engineering and adapting European designs such as the Gaulard and Gibbs transformer for US entrepreneur George Westinghouse who started building AC systems in 1886. The spread of Westinghouse and other AC systems triggered a push back in late 1887 by Edison (a proponent of direct current) who attempted to discredit alternating current as too dangerous in a public campaign called the [...] "War of Currents". In 1888 alternating current systems gained further viability with introduction of a functional AC motor, something these systems had lacked up till then. The design, an induction motor, was independently invented by Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla (with Tesla's design being licensed by Westinghouse in the US). This design was further developed into the modern practical three-phase form by Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky and Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown.|$|E
2500|$|Tesla {{invented the}} Tesla coil during {{efforts to develop}} a [...] "wireless" [...] {{lighting}} system, with gas discharge light bulbs that would glow in an oscillating electric field from a high voltage, high frequency power source. [...] For a high frequency source Tesla powered a Ruhmkorff coil (<b>induction</b> <b>coil)</b> with his high frequency alternator. [...] He found that the core losses due to the high frequency current overheated the iron core in the Ruhmkorff coil and melted the insulation between the primary and secondary windings. [...] To fix this problem Tesla changed the design {{so that there was}} an air gap instead of insulating material between the windings, and made the iron core adjustable so it could be moved in or out of the coil [...] He eventually found the highest voltages could be produced when the iron core was omitted. [...] Tesla also found he needed to put the capacitor normally used in the Ruhmkorff circuit between his alternator and the coil's primary winding to avoid burning out the coil. By adjusting the coil and capacitor Tesla found he could take advantage of the resonance set up between the two to achieve even higher frequencies. He found that the highest voltages were generated when the [...] "closed" [...] primary circuit with the capacitor was in resonance with the [...] "open" [...] secondary winding.|$|E
