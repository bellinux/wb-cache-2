5|$|Base J (beta-d-glucopyranosyloxymethyluracil), a {{modified}} form of uracil, {{is also found}} in several organisms: the flagellates Diplonema and Euglena, and all the kinetoplastid genera. Biosynthesis of J occurs in two steps: in the first step, a specific thymidine in DNA is converted into hydroxymethyldeoxyuridine; in the second, HOMedU is glycosylated to form J. Proteins that bind specifically to this base have been identified. These proteins appear to be distant relatives of the Tet1 oncogene that <b>is</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia.

5|$|The exosome <b>is</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{degradation}} and processing {{of a wide}} variety of RNA species. In the cytoplasm of cells, it <b>is</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> turn-over of messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules. The complex can degrade mRNA molecules that have been tagged for degradation because they contain errors, through interactions with proteins from the nonsense mediated decay or non-stop decay pathways. In alternative fashion, mRNAs are degraded as part of their normal turnover. Several proteins that stabilize or destabilize mRNA molecules through binding to AU-rich elements in the 3' untranslated region of mRNAs interact with the exosome complex. In the nucleus, the exosome is required for the correct processing of several small nuclear RNA molecules. Finally, the nucleolus is the compartment where the majority of the exosome complexes are found. There it plays a role in the processing of the 5.8S ribosomal RNA (the first identified function of the exosome) and of several small nucleolar RNAs.|$|E

Inside the phloem is a layer of undifferentiated cells one cell thick called the vascular cambium layer. The cells are continually dividing, creating phloem cells on the outside and wood cells known as xylem on the inside.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the added}} {{protection}} of CITES Appendix I status, wild slow lorises still receive poor protection because {{enforcement of the}} international trade ban is difficult and the penalties are minor. Slow lorises are still found in large numbers at animal markets, most notably in Cambodia and Indonesia, but the traders show no concern for being caught. During a study by Nekaris etal. published in 2010, vendors in Medan, Jakarta, and Surabaya spoke freely to researchers about how they obtain slow lorises, their uses in medicine, prices, and sales numbers. The markets were not concealed, but were open daily in a designated area in town. Even law enforcement <b>is</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trade, with park rangers and police admitting to the purchase of slow lorises for medicinal purposes.

5|$|Fusion is {{the process}} by which two lipid bilayers merge, {{resulting}} in one connected structure. If this fusion proceeds completely through both leaflets of both bilayers, a water-filled bridge is formed and the solutions contained by the bilayers can mix. Alternatively, if only one leaflet from each bilayer <b>is</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fusion process, the bilayers are said to be hemifused. Fusion is involved in many cellular processes, in particular in eukaryotes, since the eukaryotic cell is extensively sub-divided by lipid bilayer membranes. Exocytosis, fertilization of an egg by sperm and transport of waste products to the lysozome {{are a few of the}} many eukaryotic processes that rely on some form of fusion. Even the entry of pathogens can be governed by fusion, as many bilayer-coated viruses have dedicated fusion proteins to gain entry into the host cell.|$|E
