25|$|In 2000, a {{team led}} by Komatsu {{simulated}} the floods numerically with a 3-dimensional <b>hydraulic</b> <b>model.</b> They based the Glacial Lake Missoula discharge rate on the rate predicted for the Spokane Valley–Rathdrum Prairie immediately downstream of Glacial Lake Missoula, for which a number of previous estimates had placed the maximum discharge of 17 × 106m3/s and total amount of water discharged equal to the maximum estimated volume of Lake Missoula (2184nbsp&km3). Neglecting erosion effects, their simulated water flow was based on modern-day topography. Their major findings were that the calculated depth of water in each flooded location except for the Spokane Valley–Rathdrum Prairie was shallower than the field evidence showed. For example, their calculated water depth at the Pasco Basin–Wallula Gap transition zone is about 190 m, significantly less than the 280–300 m flood depth indicated by high-water marks. They concluded that a flood of ~106m3/s could not have made the observed high-water marks.|$|E

50|$|Boerhaave's {{ideas about}} the human body were heavily {{influenced}} by French mathematician and philosopher Rene Descartes. Descartes contributed much to iatromechanical theories. Another influencer of Boerhaave's reasoning was Giovanni Borelli. He was a distinguished astronomer and mathematician in the 1600s and published writings on animal motions mirroring machinery principles. Inspired by this and Cartesianism, Boerhaave proposed that the human body's operations {{are based on a}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>model.</b> In his work, he alluded to simple machines, such as levers and pulleys, as well as other mechanisms to explain parts of the body. Boerhaave described the body as made up of pipe-like structures such as are found in a machine. For example, pipes in a machine parallel the physiology of veins in the human body. Boerhaave took this mechanistic notion even further by noting the importance of a proper balance of fluid pressure. Fluids within the body should be able to move around freely, without obstacles. Similar to a machine, a well-being was self-regulating. The body must maintain these conditions to be a healthy equilibrium state. Boerhaave's view on medicine accepted this apparatus-like body philosophy and thus focused attention on materialistic problems rather than mystical explanations of illness.|$|E

5000|$|The {{controversy}} {{whether the}} Channeled Scabland landforms were formed mainly by multiple periodic floods, or {{by a single}} grand-scale cataclysmic flood from late Pleistocene Glacial Lake Missoula or from an unidentified Canadian source, continued through 1999. [...] Shaw’s team of geologists reviewed the sedimentary sequences of the Touchet beds {{and concluded that the}} sequences do not automatically imply multiple floods separated by decades or centuries. Rather, they proposed that sedimentation in the Glacial Lake Missoula basin was the result of jökulhlaups draining into Lake Missoula from British Columbia to the north. Further, Shaw’s team proposed the scabland flooding might have partially originated from an enormous subglacial reservoir that extended over much of central British Columbia, particularly including the Rocky Mountain Trench, which may have discharged by several paths, including one through Lake Missoula. This discharge, if occurring concurrently with the breach of the Lake Missoula ice dam, would have provided significantly larger volumes of water. Further, Shaw and team proposed that the rhythmic Touchet beds are the result of multiple pulses, or surges, within a single larger flood.In 2000, a team led by Komatsu simulated the floods numerically with a 3-dimensional <b>hydraulic</b> <b>model.</b> They based the Glacial Lake Missoula discharge rate on the rate predicted for the Spokane Valley-Rathdrum Prairie immediately downstream of Glacial Lake Missoula, for which a number of previous estimates had placed the maximum discharge of 17 × 106m3/s and total amount of water discharged equal to the maximum estimated volume of Lake Missoula (2184 km3).

40|$|Abstract: <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>modeling</b> of the Koondrook Perricoota Forest (KPF) {{wetlands}} adjoining the River Murray {{in southeastern}} Australia was performed for historical flooding conditions using MIKE FLOOD {{in three stages}} progressively moving from simple to more complex forms. Validation data sets for model implementation were prepared from remote sensing study, field work, mapping of the inundation area from airborne surveys, reconnaissance surveys and local knowledge. Knowledge of the KPF flood inundation processes was improved in each stage to better formulate more complex model forms. It was considered mandatory to commence simulations with simple model forms using MIKE 11 (quasi- 2 D) and then conduct targeted simulations using MIKE 21 (2 D) and MIKE FLOOD (combined 1 D flow in the runners and 2 D flow in the floodplain). On the basis of results from MIKE 11, MIKE 21 and MIKE FLOOD models, it is concluded that up to flow of about 28000 ML/d, all three <b>hydraulic</b> <b>models</b> provide similar estimates of the inundation area in the range 0 - 10 %. As flow increases further, results from the models tend to differ. Relationships between complexity of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>models</b> and accuracy of the wetland inundation areas predicted by each model form under a range of hydrological conditions are developed and discussed. Results from complex <b>hydraulic</b> <b>modeling</b> were synthesised into simple and practical tools designed for use by water managers and {{for the application of}} basin-scale hydrological models incorporating the effects of environmental flow diversions in large wetlands...|$|R
