5|$|Despite Venice's {{economic}} and maritime decline, in 1601 {{at the behest}} of the Doge Marino Grimani, the Venetian Senate <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> new bucentaur built at the cost of 70,000 ducats; although the existing one was still in service, experts regarded it as too old. The designer of the new ship is unknown, but he was selected from among the most qualified marangoni (ships' carpenters) of the Arsenale. The work was supervised by Marco Antonio Memmo, the sovraprovveditore (overseer of the provveditore) of the Arsenale.

5|$|The {{most famous}} and well-recorded duel {{occurred}} on 21 July 1865, in Springfield, Missouri. Wild Bill Hickok and Davis Tutt quarreled over cards and <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> gunfight. They arranged to walk towards each other at 6 p.m. Wild Bill's armed presence caused the crowd to immediately scatter {{to the safety of}} nearby buildings, leaving Tutt alone in the northwestern corner of the square. When they were about 50 yards apart, both men drew their guns. The two fired at the same time, but Hickok's shot hit Tutt in the heart, while Tutt's shot missed. This was the first recorded example of two men taking part in a quick-draw duel. The following month Hickok was acquitted after pleading self-defense. The first story of the shootout was detailed in an article in Harper's Magazine in 1867, and became a staple of the gunslinger legend.|$|E

25|$|Missouri and Iowa State {{first met}} in 1896 and the {{regional}} rivalry was born. Before the 1959 match-up between the two schools, {{which took place in}} Ames, Iowa, field testing showed that the telephones the two schools used to communicate with their coaches in the coaches box were wired so that either school could hear what was happening on the other sideline. The problem was fixed before the game, but neither of the two coaches knew that. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company of Ames then <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> trophy made to commemorate the incident, and thus the Telephone Trophy was born. Missouri leads the rivalry 61–34–9 all-time. When Missouri left the Big 12 for the SEC the rivalry was essentially ended.|$|E

25|$|Austin {{lost his}} title to Angle at Unforgiven by {{submitting}} to the ankle lock, but began badgering Angle for a rematch after claiming {{his hand was}} under the ropes (which it was). Austin received that rematch on the October 8 episode of Raw and won the title after WWF Commissioner William Regal betrayed Angle and joined the Alliance. Austin then began feuding with Alliance member Rob Van Dam, who was {{the only member of}} the Alliance to be cheered by the fans despite the villainous tactics of the group. Austin faced Angle and Van Dam at No Mercy later that month and won by pinning the latter.

The Rock's team included Jericho, Kane, The Undertaker and Big Show. Before Survivor Series, Austin and Rock rekindled their rivalry at the UK-only pay-per-view Rebellion and Austin successfully defended his WWF title with help from Angle.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} Notre Dame {{reflected}} rising status of Irish Americans and Catholics in the 1920s. Catholics rallied {{up around the}} team {{and listened to the}} games on the radio, especially when it knocked off the schools that symbolized the Protestant establishment in America—Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Army. Yet this role as high-profile flagship institution of Catholicism made it an easy target of anti-Catholicism. The most remarkable episode of violence was the clash between Notre Dame students and the Ku Klux Klan, a white supremacist and anti-catholic movement, in 1924. Nativism and anti-Catholicism, especially when directed towards immigrants, were cornerstones of the KKK's rhetoric, and Notre Dame was seen {{as a symbol of the}} threat posed by the Catholic Church. The Klan <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> week-long Klavern in South Bend. Clashes with the student body started on March 17, when students, aware of the anti-Catholic animosity, blocked the Klansmen from descending from their trains in the South Bend station and ripped the KKK clothes and regalia. On May 19 thousands of students massed downtown protesting the Klavern, and only the arrival of college president Fr. Matthew Walsh prevented any further clashes. The next day, football coach Knute Rockne spoke at a campus rally and implored the students to obey the college president and refrain from further violence. A few days later the Klavern broke up, but the hostility shown by the students was an omen and a contribution to the downfall of the KKK in Indiana.|$|E
