500|$|On March 6, 2007, Sports Illustrated {{reported}} that Angle's name {{was found in}} the client database of a Florida wellness center suspected of being a front for distributing performance enhancing drugs. The magazine alleged that Angle had received prescriptions for trenbolone (which is not approved for human use by the FDA) and nandrolone, both anabolic steroids. Angle responded on his official website: [...] "I did not improperly receive prescriptions. It is well documented that in my career I have broken vertebrae <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> on five occasions and each time the course of treatment was under the care and supervision of my doctors. Any attempt to link me to the athletes in the current news accounts who may have improperly sought performance-enhancing drugs is without foundation".|$|E
2500|$|On 8 July 2003, {{at the age}} of 18, Goodrem was {{diagnosed}} with Hodgkin's lymphoma. She was forced to put all working commitments on hold while undertaking treatment for the disease. In an exclusive interview with The Australian Women's Weekly, Goodrem revealed that, since 2002, she had suffered from a head-to-toe rash, fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, and a lump on her neck. [...] "I was doing sit-ups when I felt something pop <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b> I reached down and I felt a small lump at the base of my throat. It wasn't sore, it wasn't visible, but I could feel it." [...] As part of her treatment, Goodrem undertook chemotherapy, which resulted in the loss of her hair, and radiation therapy. The news of her diagnosis made newspaper and television headlines and an outpouring of support was shown by fans and the general public alike. Goodrem thanked them during The Visualise Tour for all the letters and well wishes she received.|$|E

2500|$|In September 2009, it was {{reported}} that Collins could no longer play drums, due to a recent operation to repair dislocated vertebrae in his neck. However, a statement from Collins on the Genesis band website said, [...] "There isn't any drama regarding my 'disability' and playing drums. Somehow, during the last Genesis tour, I dislocated some vertebrae <b>in</b> <b>my</b> upper <b>neck</b> and that affected my hands. After a successful operation on <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> <b>my</b> hands still can't function normally. Maybe in a year or so it will change, but for now it is impossible for me to play drums or piano. I am not in any 'distressed' state, stuff happens in life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] exclaimed Bessie, {{recovering}} herself, [...] "I {{am not a}} mermaid {{nor even}} a dear gazelle, and, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> humble opinion, there was far more grace in preventing heroism from being 'unwept, unnoticed, and unsung,' than <b>in</b> perilling <b>my</b> own <b>neck,</b> craning down and strangling the miserable beast, by pulling him up by the scrough of his neck! What an introduction would have been lost!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Collins had {{reportedly}} lost {{hearing in}} his left ear in 2000 due to a viral infection; the condition was resolved after the infection was cured. In September 2009, {{it was reported that}} Collins could no longer play the drums, due to a recent operation to repair dislocated vertebrae in his neck. A statement from Collins on the Genesis band website said, [...] "There isn't any drama regarding my 'disability' and playing drums.

[...] However, in 2010 Collins alluded to feelings of depression and low self-esteem in recent years, claiming {{in an interview that he}} had contemplated suicide, but he resisted for the sake of his children.|$|R
60|$|My {{uncle had}} the {{goodness}} to interpose and prevent this consummation of drunken folly, which, I suppose, would have otherwise ended <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> being broken.|$|E
60|$|I {{am not a}} bit {{the worse}} of it, except fore-mentioned state of hands, a slight crick <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> from the rain running down, and general {{stiffness}} from pulling, hauling, and tugging for dear life.|$|E

6000|$|... "You don't think, Marian, I {{was going}} to be shabby enough to leave Gerald alone in the scrape? No, if I do, I'll give you leave to tell of me or do {{whatever}} you please; but you see now he is not in disgrace for drawing that pretty little beast, but for giving poor unfortunate a bit of his mind, so what use would there be <b>in</b> <b>my</b> putting <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> into the noose before my time? No, if Gerald is the fellow I take him for, and stands out about begging her pardon, the whole business of the book will blow over, and we shall hear no more of it." ...|$|R

60|$|Ginevra being, I suppose, tired with dancing, sought me out <b>in</b> <b>my</b> retreat. She {{threw herself}} on the bench beside me, and (a {{demonstration}} I could very well have dispensed with) cast her arms round <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{it means}} bein' hanged. I was so near hanged, {{just a day}} or two back, that I've had an 'orrible pain <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> ever since at the bare thought of it! But who's your friend?" [...] said Bumpus, turning to the boatswain.|$|E

'And, Peter, dear, though I can't give them my fur, I wouldn't mind their building in it. Fancy a nest <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> with little spotty eggs in it! O Peter, how perfectly lovely!' ...|$|E
60|$|What {{manner of}} thing was upon me I did not know, {{but that it}} was large and heavy and many-legged I could feel. My hands were at its throat before the fangs had a chance to bury {{themselves}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> and slowly I forced the hairy face from me and closed my fingers, vise-like, upon its windpipe.|$|E
60|$|I {{stooped to}} kiss the red lips, but {{something}} was <b>in</b> <b>my</b> way. It {{turned out to be}} a cold cigar. Miss Sellars thoughtfully removed it, and threw it away. Our lips met. Her large arms closed about <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> and held me tight.|$|R

6000|$|... 'I don't {{know all}} I have done, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> fatuity,' said Mr. Wickfield, putting out his hands, {{as if to}} deprecate my condemnation. 'He knows best,' meaning Uriah Heep, 'for {{he has always been}} at my elbow, {{whispering}} me.

6000|$|With {{a scream}} of delight she rushed forward and sprang into them.

6000|$|... "'What {{happened}} just after that I never could remember, except that I got a wound here <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> and a cut on my flank; the scar is there still, and I'm proud of it, though buyers always {{consider it a}} blemish.

6000|$|... "Well, comrade, {{you have}} saved my life; and I am your servant, {{so long as}} I live. I thought all was over with me. The leopard, as it sprang, threw its full weight on my comrade, here. We had just risen to our feet; and the blow struck me, also, to the ground. I raised that cry as I fell. I lay there, immovable. I felt the leopard's paw between my shoulders, and heard its angry growlings; and I held my breath, expecting every moment to feel its teeth <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b>|$|E

6000|$|We hear so many rumors, {{and none}} of them ever come true.

6000|$|... 'Twas late when I awoke {{the next}} day with {{something}} of a dull ache <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> and a prodigious stiffness, studying the pleatings of the bed canopy over my head. And I know not how long I lay idly thus when I perceived Mrs. Willis moving quietly about, and my grandfather sitting in the armchair by the window, looking into Freshwater Lane. As my eyes fell upon him my memory came surging back,--first of the duel, then of its cause. And finally, like a leaden weight, the thought of the deception I had practised upon him, of which he must have learned ere this. Nay, I was sure from the troubled look of his face that he knew of it.|$|E
6000|$|Two {{enormous}} wooden pots painted black, {{and suspended}} by asses' ears, swung from the cross-trees {{of an old}} top-mast, planted {{in front of an}} old doorway. The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows. Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but I could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort of crick was <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> as I gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes, two of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me. It's ominous, thinks I. A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port; tombstones staring at me in the whalemen's chapel, and here a gallows! and a pair of prodigious black pots too! Are these last throwing out oblique hints touching Tophet? ...|$|E

5000|$|Most of the {{recordings}} on this CD were done as if live. ...I {{sat in front}} of microphones with my bouzouki or mandolin <b>in</b> <b>my</b> lap, <b>my</b> harmonica <b>in</b> its holder round <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> and <b>my</b> drone volume pedal on the floor, under my foot, and played and sang all in one go. —Sleeve notes from Andy Irvine - Rain on the Roof.|$|R
60|$|The bar was now {{four inches}} {{and a half}} deep <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> {{and there was only}} a little bit of skin to cut through. My sensations were those of entire happiness, for I felt that in a few minutes, at farthest, I should be {{relieved}} from my disagreeable situation. And in this expectation I was not at all deceived. At twenty-five minutes past five in the afternoon, precisely, the huge minute-hand had proceeded sufficiently far on its terrible revolution to sever the small remainder of my neck. I was not sorry to see the head which had occasioned me so much embarrassment at length make a final separation from my body. It first rolled {{down the side of the}} steeple, then lodge, for a few seconds, in the gutter, and then made its way, with a plunge, into the middle of the street.|$|E

6000|$|I'm {{not able}} to scratch or fight to-day, or I wouldn't let you cover me up with this heap of gold; but I've got a rheumatic creak <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> which makes me {{physically}} stiff and morally supple and unprincipled, so I've put two pounds sixteen in my own [...] "till," [...] where it just fills up some lowering of the tide lately by German bands and the like, and I've put ten pounds aside for Sheffield Museum, now in instant mendicity, and I've put ten pounds aside till you and I can have a talk and you be made reasonable, after being scolded and scratched, after which, on your promise to keep to our old bargain and enjoy spending your little [...] "Frondes" [...] income, I'll be your lovingest again.

6000|$|... "He {{gave me this}} in the face." [...] The man {{indicated}} his scar. [...] "Then {{he kicked}} me. It was like a cart-horse. I got up, and seeing he hadn't finished, I started off full tilt with my arms doubled up over my face. But he ran on those gawky legs of his faster than a racehorse, and kept landing out at me with sledge hammer kicks, and bringing his pickaxe down {{on the back of}} my head. I made for the lagoon, and went <b>in</b> up to <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b> He stopped at the water, for he hated getting his feet wet, and began to make a shindy, something like a peacock's, only hoarser. He started strutting up and down the beach. I'll admit I felt small to see this blessed fossil lording it there. And my head and face were all bleeding, and--well, my body just one jelly of bruises.|$|R
60|$|Thus was {{it with me}} then. I grasped my cudgel {{more firmly}} and unslung my javelin, {{carrying}} it <b>in</b> <b>my</b> left hand. I peered to left and right, but I saw nothing.

60|$|It is true, however, {{that until}} quite {{the end of}} this history when it became needful to do so to save another, I never made any further attempt to remove it from <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> not even when it rubbed a sore <b>in</b> <b>my</b> skin, because I did not wish to offend the prejudices of Hans.|$|R
