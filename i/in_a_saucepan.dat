5|$|Selling and {{purchasing}} fresh false morels {{is legal}} in Finland, {{where it is}} highly regarded. However, the mushrooms are {{required by law to}} be accompanied with a warning that they are poisonous and legally prescribed preparation instructions. False morels are also sold prepared and canned, in which case they are ready to be used. Official figures from the Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry report a total amount of false morels sold in Finland of 21.9tonnes in 2006 and 32.7tonnes, noted as being above average, in 2007. In 2002, the Finnish Food Safety Authority estimated annual consumption of false morels to be hundreds of tonnes in plentiful years. In Finnish cuisine, false morels may be cooked in an omelette, or gently sautéed in butter <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>saucepan,</b> flour and milk added to make a bechamel sauce, or pie filling. Alternatively, more fluid can be added for a false morel soup. Typical condiments added for flavour include parsley, chives, dill and black pepper.|$|E

60|$|It {{was late}} {{next morning when}} Oliver awoke, from a sound, long sleep. There was no other {{person in the room}} but the old Jew, who was boiling some coffee <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>saucepan</b> for breakfast, and {{whistling}} softly to himself as he stirred it round and round, with an iron spoon. He would stop every now and then to listen when there was the least noise below: and when he had satisfied himself, he would go on whistling and stirring again, as before.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Brunt was {{crouching}} at {{the small}} stove, putting a little rice pudding into the oven. He rose then, and attentively poked <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small <b>saucepan</b> on the hob with a fork. Then he replaced the saucepan lid.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Wilks muttered that he didn't know, and lay crossly {{regarding}} his attentive neighbour as she {{knelt down and}} daintily lit the fire. This task finished, she proceeded to make the room tidy, and then set about making beef-tea <b>in</b> <b>a</b> little <b>saucepan.</b>|$|R
60|$|There {{was a low}} brick fireplace, full of fire, an old blue Turkish rug, {{the little}} oak table with the lamp and the white-and-blue cloth and the dessert, and Gudrun making coffee <b>in</b> <b>an</b> odd brass coffee-maker, and Winifred {{scalding}} <b>a</b> little milk <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tiny <b>saucepan.</b>|$|R

When he was asleep, I'd make a spoon red hot, and I'd have some boiling liquor {{bubbling}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>saucepan,</b> and I'd take it out hissing, and I'd open his mouth with the other hand--or perhaps he'd sleep with his mouth ready open--and I'd pour it down his throat, and blister it and choke him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{he spoke}} Kea, {{who had come}} out with us, clad {{from head to foot}} in her simple, long Hawaiian robe, gazed {{steadily}} over the brink, and looked down with a familiar glance into the gigantic crater. For a minute or two she kept her eyes fixed on a certain jagged peak or furnace of lava, round whose base the sea of liquid fire was surging and falling, like water <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>saucepan</b> on a kitchen stove. At last she broke out into sudden surprise, [...] "Why, it's rising!" [...] she cried breathlessly. [...] "It's rising! It's rising!" ...|$|E

50|$|For {{volumetric}} objects (e.g. pillow, blanket, sleeping bag, rug), boiling <b>in</b> <b>a</b> large <b>saucepan</b> {{for more}} than 10 minutes represents <b>a</b> reliable method. <b>In</b> this manner, the lethal temperatures propagate with certainty deep inside the object, which {{is not necessarily the}} case of a washing machine cleaning cycle.|$|R
60|$|The men who officiated as cooks--and who, by agreement, {{had been}} {{released}} from all night duty in consideration of their regularly undertaking that occupation--now brought <b>in</b> <b>a</b> large <b>saucepan</b> full of soup; and each man went up with his canteen, and received his portion, returning to his bed upon the straw to eat it.|$|R

60|$|His supper {{was cooking}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>saucepan</b> on the fire, and, when she moved, {{it was to}} make it ready {{for him on the}} table. He took his usual seat, she took hers, and he began his meal. They did not, as yet, look at one another. By little and little he began; laying down his knife and fork with a noise, taking things up sharply, biting at his bread as if he were {{offended}} with it, and in other similar ways showing that he was out of sorts. At length he pushed his plate from him, and spoke aloud; with the strangest inconsistency.|$|E
60|$|Sir Pitt is {{not what}} we silly girls, when we used to read Cecilia at Chiswick, {{imagined}} a baronet must have been. Anything, indeed, less like Lord Orville cannot be imagined. Fancy an old, stumpy, short, vulgar, and very dirty man, in old clothes and shabby old gaiters, who smokes a horrid pipe, and cooks his own horrid supper <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>saucepan.</b> He speaks with a country accent, and swore a great deal at the old charwoman, at the hackney coachman who drove us to the inn where the coach went from, and on which I made the journey OUTSIDE FOR THE GREATER PART OF THE WAY.|$|E
60|$|He {{lifted the}} hangings from the wall, {{uncovering}} the second door: this, too, he opened. In a room without a window, there burnt a fire guarded {{by a high}} and strong fender, and a lamp suspended from the ceiling by a chain. Grace Poole bent over the fire, apparently cooking something <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>saucepan.</b> In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure ran backwards and forwards. What it was, whether beast or human being, one could not, at first sight, tell: it grovelled, seemingly, on all fours; it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal: but it was covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild as a mane, hid its head and face.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{variants}} to local recipes for its preparation but basically {{the meat and}} rind are boiled with salt, then minced and mixed with finely ground green cabbage.

6000|$|... "Dear, dear, what {{a disappointing}} world this is! I no sooner build a nice castle in Spain, and settle a smart young knight therein, than down it comes about my ears; and the ungrateful youth, who might fight dragons, if he chose, insists on {{quenching}} his energies <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>saucepan,</b> {{and making a}} Saint Lawrence of himself by wasting his life {{on a series of}} gridirons.

[...] And Di wrestled with her knitting as if it were Fate, and she were paying off the grudge she owed it.|$|E
60|$|Not many doors from here, I {{went into}} a room on the first floor. The woman apologised for its being in 'an untidy mess.' The day was Saturday, and she was boiling the children's clothes <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>saucepan</b> on the hearth. There was nothing else into which she could have put them. There was no crockery, or tinware, or tub, or bucket. There was an old gallipot or two, {{and there was a}} broken bottle or so, and there were some broken boxes for seats. The last small {{scraping}} of coals left was raked together {{in a corner of the}} floor. There were some rags in an open cupboard, also on the floor. In a corner of the room was a crazy old French bed-stead, with a man lying on his back upon it in a ragged pilot jacket, and rough oil-skin fantail hat. The room was perfectly black. It was difficult to believe, at first, that it was not purposely coloured black, the walls were so begrimed.|$|E

He was ill for thirty-three days, and his wife and sister, who is the wife of the Prince of Squillace, another son of the Pope's, were with him and cooked for him <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>saucepan</b> for fear of his being poisoned, as the Duke of Valentinois so hated him. And the Pope had him guarded by sixteen men for fear that the duke should kill him. And when the Pope went to visit him Valentinois did not {{accompany}} him, save on one occasion, when he said that what had not been done at breakfast might be done at supper.... On August 17 he [Valentinois] entered the room where the prince was already risen from his bed, and, driving out the wife and sister, called in his man, named Michieli, and had the prince strangled; and that night he was buried." ...|$|E

50|$|The dish {{is a basic}} white stew {{made with}} a few simple {{ingredients}}: skirts, kidneys, onions, thyme, salt, white pepper, water, and potatoes.

60|$|The ancient world, {{because of}} its {{metallurgical}} inferiority, could not use steam. The steam engine, even the primitive pumping engine, could not develop before sheet iron was available. The early engines seem to the modern eye very pitiful and clumsy bits of ironmongery, but they were the utmost that the metallurgical science of the time could do. As late as 1856 came the Bessemer process, and presently (1864) the open-hearth process, in which steel and every sort of iron could be melted, purified and cast in a manner and upon a scale hitherto unheard of. To-day in the electric furnace one may see tons of incandescent steel swirling about like boiling milk <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>saucepan.</b> Nothing in the previous practical advances of mankind is comparable in its consequences to the complete mastery over enormous masses of steel and iron and over their texture and quality which man has now achieved. The railways and early engines of all sorts were the mere first triumphs of the new metallurgical methods. Presently came ships of iron and steel, vast bridges, and {{a new way of}} building with steel upon a gigantic scale. Men realized too late that they had planned their railways with far too timid a gauge, that they could have organized their travelling with far more steadiness and comfort upon a much bigger scale.|$|E
