2500|$|After an eight-and-a-half-month trial the U.S. District Court of South Dakota (Fred Joseph Nichol, {{presiding}} judge) {{dismissed the}} charges against Banks and Means for conspiracy and assault (both Banks and Means were defended by William Kunstler and Mark Lane). The jury had voted 12-0 to acquit both defendants of the conspiracy charge, but before the second vote one juror suffered a stroke and could not continue deliberations. The government refused to accept a verdict of eleven jurors and sought a mistrial; [...] "n the meantime the defense team filed a motion for <b>judgment</b> of acquittal, <b>thus</b> <b>giving</b> this court the alternative of granting a mistrial or ruling on the motion." [...] The judge ruled to dismiss citing prosecutorial misconduct, {{the basis of the}} defense's move to acquit. [...] "Because I am ruling on the motion through use of the supervisory power and am not making an evaluation of the sufficiency of the evidence, a judgment of acquittal would be inappropriate. It is true that a judgment of dismissal is not the only possible remedy in this situation, i. e. a new trial could be ordered. It is my belief, however, that the misconduct by the government in this case is so aggravated that a dismissal must be entered in the interests of justice." [...] In 1975 the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the government's appeal was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause and dismissed it, [...] "despite Government's argument that jurisdiction should be assumed due to the public interest in fair trials designed to end in just judgements." ...|$|R

50|$|The writ is {{distinguished}} from other remedies primarily {{in terms of}} the timing of the grounds for objecting to the judgment, rather than the actual nature of the grounds, such as whether they are purely equitable.
