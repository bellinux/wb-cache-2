50|$|Full-page strips were {{eventually}} replaced by strips half that size. Strips such as The Phantom and Terry and the Pirates began appearing in a format of two strips to a page in full-size newspapers, {{such as the}} New Orleans Times Picayune, or with one strip on a tabloid page, as in the Chicago Sun-Times. When Sunday strips {{began to appear in}} more than one format, it became necessary for the cartoonist to allow for rearranged, cropped or <b>dropped</b> <b>panels.</b> During World War II, because of paper shortages, the size of Sunday strips began to shrink.

40|$|Seismic {{capacity}} {{evaluation of}} post-tensioned concrete slab-column frame buildings designed only for gravity loads and wind load is presented. The series of nonlinear pushover analyses {{are carried out}} by using the computer program SAP 2000. An equivalent frame model with explicit transverse torsional members is introduced for modeling slab-column connections. The analyses are carried out by ollowingguidelines in ATC- 40 and FEMA- 273 / 274, where several important factors such as P-Delta effects, strength and stiffness contributions from masonry infill walls, and foundation flexibility are well taken into account. The pushover analysis results, presented {{in the form of}} capacity curves, are compared with the seismic demand from the expected earthquake ground motion for Bangkok and then the seismic performance can be evaluated. Numerical examples are performed on the 9 - and 30 -storey post-tension flat-plate buildings in Bangkok. The results show that in general post-tensioned concrete slab-column frame buildings without shear wall possess relatively low lateral stiffness, low lateral strength capacity, and poor inelastic response characteristics. The evaluation also shows that the slab-column frame combined with the shear wall system and <b>drop</b> <b>panel</b> can increase the strength and stiffness significantly...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Memorial University of Newfoundland, 2002. Engineering and Applied ScienceBibliography: leaves 231 - 245 Strengthening of {{existing}} concrete structural elements {{is a viable}} means for improving the performance of such elements. Plenty of strengthening-related research work on beams and columns has been conducted. However, research work related to two-way slab strengthening is very scarce. Hence, there are academic and industrial needs to investigate such an issue experimentally and theoretically. This thesis {{is an attempt to}} fill the need for an experimental and theoretical research work on the punching shear and flexural strengthening of two-way slab system. [...] The experimental phase of this research work includes testing of three groups of specimens. The first and second groups are composed of specimens strengthened using steel plates and steel bolts. The specimens of the first group are loaded centrally omV The second group of specimens is loaded centrally combined with lateral static or cyclic moment. The specimens of the third group are loaded centrally and strengthened with either Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) strips or Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) laminates. [...] The first group of specimens is used to develop and optimize a strengthening technique using the integration of steel plates and steel bolts. The effectiveness of four different configurations of steel plates and steel bolts are evaluated. The steel plates are assumed to act as horizontal flexural reinforcement representing an equivalent concrete <b>drop</b> <b>panel.</b> Moreover, the steel bolts are designed to act as vertical shear reinforcement, to transfer the horizontal forces between steel plates and concrete slab, and to confine the concrete between the steel plates. An average increase in the load capacity of 50 % is achieved over that of the unstrengthened specimens. [...] The second group of specimens is intended to evaluate the performance of recommended steel strengthening technique for specimens subjected to static or cyclic moments. The ultimate load capacity is increased by an average of 122 % for specimens subjected to static moment compared to the unstrengthened specimens. For the specimens subjected to cyclic moment, the lateral drift is increased by 76 % compared to the unstrengthened specimens. [...] The third group includes specimens strengthened using CFRP strips and GFRP laminates for flexural-strengthening. In addition, This group includes specimens strengthened with CFRP strips and steel bolts for punching-shear strengthening. Utilizing CFRP strips and GFRP laminates contribute to an average increase of the flexural capacity of two-way slabs by an average of 36 % compared to that of the unstrengthened specimens. However, a small average increase within 9 % is achieved for the CFRP punching shear-strengthening. [...] The theoretical work is composed of two parts: mechanical model and Finite Element Analysis (FEA). In the first part, a mechanical model is developed to analyze centrally loaded two-way slabs strengthened using steel plates. A concrete model that considers the biaxial state of stress of concrete as well as the confinement effect of steel plates is introduced. An iterative incremental mechanical model is used to determine the load carrying capacity and to evaluate the deformation characteristics of strengthened slabs at each load increment until failure. [...] In the finite element analysis part, a full bond assumption is made between the concrete and both reinforcing steel bars and the strengthening FRP material. The comparison between the FEA and the experimental results showed an acceptable agreement. A tension-stiffening model is recommended for the concrete constitutive model taking into consideration the effect of strengthening material on the concrete behaviour in tension. In addition a regression equation based on the statistical approach of the Response Surface Methodology is recommended. The tension stiffening model is useful as an input in finite element packages and useful for classical approaches. In addition, The regression design equations can be used to provide simple design guide for engineers to predict the ultimate load carrying capacity of CFRP and GFRP strengthened two-way slabs...|$|E

40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} {{flat slab}} floors are {{used throughout the}} world as an economical structural system for many building applications. In moderate and high seismic regions, a more rigid structural system, such as a shear wall or moment resisting beam column frame, is generally added to provide adequate lateral resistance. Nevertheless, the slab-column system must maintain its gravity load capacity even after numerous cyclic lateral displacements. In retrofit analysis of older buildings, it is also beneficial to include the lateral resistance provided by the slab-column frames as this may substantially {{reduce the cost of}} the overall building retrofit [Hueste 1999]. The objective of this project was to create a general, robust hysteretic model for the response of slab-column connections to earthquake excitation, with particular attention to older non-ductile construction.
