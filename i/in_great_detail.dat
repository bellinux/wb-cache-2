Who biographer Dave Marsh subsequently said the interview described the narrative better than the finished album. Townshend later regretted publishing so much detail, as he felt it forced him to write the album according to that blueprint. The rest of the Who, however, were enthusiastic about the idea, and let him have artistic control over the project.|$|E
5|$|It is {{acceptable}} to defend from a violent attack anywhere on the street especially {{when a person is}} attacked with a knife or another deadly weapon. Shooting an unarmed attacker also occurs and becomes sometimes a subject of controversy. In general, each case is investigated <b>in</b> <b>great</b> <b>detail</b> before being eventually dismissed as a legitimate self-defense. The defense is judged according to the subjective and objective perception of the defender {{during the time of the}} imminent or ongoing attack, and not according to the view of persons who are judging it ex post.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's {{early works}} and early life have been {{neglected}} topics within Johnson scholarship. As a result, he is primarily {{known for the}} events surrounding his later life and later works like A Dictionary of the English Language. This imbalance originates in the failure of James Boswell, Johnson's friend and companion, to discuss <b>in</b> <b>great</b> <b>detail</b> Johnson's childhood {{and the beginning of}} his career within the Life of Samuel Johnson, the most famous biography on Johnson. In particular, Boswell ignored Johnson's early politics and political writings which show a concern with Sir Robert Walpole's political administration.|$|E

5|$|Though the {{structure}} of the Earthsea novels is in many ways typical of fantasy, it has been described as subverting the tropes of this genre. The protagonists of her stories, with the exception of Tenar, were all dark-skinned, in comparison to the white-skinned heroes more traditionally used. The Tombs of Atuan examines the development of a young girl <b>in</b> <b>great</b> <b>detail,</b> a choice unusual for a fantasy writer of the period in which the book was written.|$|E
5|$|Andriamanelo is {{typically}} {{portrayed as a}} civilizing king {{in contrast to the}} primitive Vazimba against whom he waged war. As such, oral history credits him with discovering such diverse arts as silversmithing and astrology (sikidy) in addition to iron working. He reputedly introduced knowledge about the construction and use of pirogues, and was the first in the highlands to transform lowland swamps into irrigated rice paddies through the construction of dikes in the valleys around Alasora. The Merina rite of circumcision, described by Bloch (1986) <b>in</b> <b>great</b> <b>detail,</b> continued to be practiced by the Merina monarchy {{through the end of the}} 19th century in precisely the way first established by Andriamanelo generations before. Many elements of these rituals continue to form part of the circumcision traditions of Merina families in the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|At one time, {{the island}} was {{considered}} an arid location, where coconuts were the only useful plants likely to flourish and vegetables were difficult to produce. In {{what has become a}} tropical climate, vegetation is more abundant than in the north of the country, especially during the wet season. Anxious {{to attract the attention of}} the French colonial administration which he judged insufficiently involved in the development of Casamance, administrator Emmanuel Bertrand-Bocandé submitted a report which documented <b>in</b> <b>great</b> <b>detail</b> the plant species then present on the island. Although this report was written in 1849, the information it contains has remained valuable even into the 21st century.|$|E

5|$|Carpentier’s {{historical}} {{account is}} greatly simplified {{in order to}} increase the contrast between the white land owners and their black slaves. The marvellous, one of the most notable features of the novel, is used as a marker of contrast between the two groups: firstly, because mention of the magical always takes the form of the slaves' point of view, while the more real interpretation of each event is from the whites' perspective; secondly, because the marvellous is used as a weapon to fight injustice. Instances of cruelty and violence between the groups are recounted grotesquely <b>in</b> <b>great</b> <b>detail,</b> which enhances the rivalry. More importantly, by allowing readers to see through the slaves' point of view, Carpentier brings to light the power and durability of the Haitian community and destabilizes the narrative of Western supremacy.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens have a {{wide range}} of vocalizations which are of {{interest}} to ornithologists. Gwinner carried out important studies in the early 1960s, recording and photographing his findings <b>in</b> <b>great</b> <b>detail.</b> Fifteen to 30 categories of vocalization have been recorded for this species, most of which are used for social interaction. Calls recorded include alarm calls, chase calls, and flight calls. The species has a distinctive, deep, resonant prruk-prruk-prruk call, which to experienced listeners is unlike that of any other corvid. Its very wide and complex vocabulary includes a high, knocking toc-toc-toc, a dry, grating kraa, a low guttural rattle and some calls of an almost musical nature.|$|E
5|$|Daphnis et Chloé was {{commissioned}} in or about 1909 by the impresario Sergei Diaghilev for his company, the Ballets Russes. Ravel began work with Diaghilev's choreographer, Michel Fokine, and designer, Léon Bakst. Fokine {{had a reputation}} for his modern approach to dance, with individual numbers replaced by continuous music. This appealed to Ravel, and after discussing the action <b>in</b> <b>great</b> <b>detail</b> with Fokine, Ravel began composing the music. There were frequent disagreements between the collaborators, and the premiere was under-rehearsed because of the late completion of the work. It had an unenthusiastic reception and was quickly withdrawn, although it was revived successfully a year later in Monte Carlo and London. The effort to complete the ballet took its toll on Ravel's health; neurasthenia obliged him to rest for several months after the premiere.|$|E
