25|$|Despite the restoration, Thebes never regained {{its former}} prominence. The death of Cassander in 297 BC created a power vacuum {{throughout}} much of Greece, which contributed, in part, to Thebes' besiegement by Demetrius Poliorcetes in 293 BC, and again after a revolt in 292BC. This last siege was difficult and Demetrios was wounded, but finally he managed {{to break down the}} walls and to take the city once more, treating <b>it</b> <b>mildly</b> despite its fierce resistance. The city recovered its autonomy from Demetrios in 287BC, and became allied with Lysimachus and the Aetolian League.|$|E

Riane Eisler, writing in the Christian Science Monitor, argued that, [...] "to put <b>it</b> <b>mildly,</b> this blind spot makes the index very inaccurate."

500|$|Only {{two songs}} [...] "Vacant" [...] and [...] "Potions", {{have ever been}} {{identified}} as Tapeworm songs. Neither have been released, though cover versions by Maynard James Keenan's other projects have surfaced. The first, [...] "Vacant" [...] was initially conceived during the Tapeworm sessions; the track being written by Lohner and re-arranged by Clouser, with lyrics and melody by Keenan and chorus and backing vocals by Reznor. The song was first performed live by A Perfect Circle throughout their 2001 tour. MTV reported that Reznor was apparently not happy that Keenan performed the song: [...] "I have to admit I find <b>it</b> <b>mildly</b> irritating for [...] "Vacant" [...] to debut in this fashion before feeling it has been properly realized," [...] Shortly after {{the dissolution of the}} Tapeworm project, Keenan released a reworked version on A Perfect Circle's 2004 cover album Emotive under the title [...] "Passive".|$|E
500|$|Upon {{the news}} of Francis' casting, Sara Bibel of Xfinity wrote that the soap opera had [...] "finally {{mastered}} the art of stunt casting". She also stated that seeing Francis paired with Tristan Rogers [...] "will be delicious", and that she thought [...] "we can all agree this is a far more exciting addition to the show than Eric Roberts or Sean Young". She gave [...] "kudos" [...] to the soap opera for creating [...] "what is sure to be must-see daytime TV". When news broke of Francis' dismissal, Bibel wrote: [...] "Francis's character, Genevieve, was, to put <b>it</b> <b>mildly,</b> not an audience favorite. She started out as a dark psychopath hellbent on revenge then, when that persona made the character less than viable over the longterm, morphed overnight into an aspiring business woman. Neither incarnation played to Francis’s strengths as an actress." [...] Omar White-Nobles of TVSource wrote: [...] "Genevieve was determined to bring down her crime lord husband Colin (Tristan Rogers) and attempt to reconcile with her son. Unfortunately for Francis, playing a vengeful ice queen turned shrewd businesswoman didn’t work for the audience. Subsequent attempts to soften the character failed as well, leaving aborted pairings with Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman) and Victor Newman (Eric Braeden)." ...|$|E

[...] The article also contains pictures, one of them showing Blythe holding a fan down on the ground. Meanwhile, another report released two days after the concert by metalopolis.net alleged that [...] "Randy in a totally uncompromising way took down an impertinent fan, who has climbed the podium several times. The front-man clearly showed that it is his territory, he struck the intruder down, punched him a couple of times and sent him through the air off the podium, without even stopping singing (!)" [...] On May 28, 2010, the report by marastmusic.com stated that [...] "some broken head was a testimony to the fact that the band does not like anybody on the stage", [...] while abysszine.com stated that [...] "the only negative thing about the concert was, to say <b>it</b> <b>mildly,</b> disputable approach of the band towards the stage-divers ... when somebody tried to climb the stage, he was brutally swept down." ...|$|E

500|$|According to numismatists William D. Hyder and R.W. Colbert, [...] "Borglum, to put <b>it</b> <b>mildly,</b> was a temperamental {{artist who}} managed to offend most {{everyone}} with whom he worked". They note that [...] "Borglum's past insolence had not left him in the good graces of the art community" [...] and his designs met a hostile reception at the commission. Sculptor member James Earle Fraser, designer of the Buffalo nickel, rejected Borglum's initial design on July 22, eight days after they were received. [...] The inscription on the reverse included a tribute to Harding; Fraser deemed it inartistic. [...] Borglum submitted a second set on August 14, this was again rejected; the commission criticized the design, {{which seemed to be}} only a segment of a larger one, rather than specifically designed to fit a half dollar. [...] Borglum wanted to ignore what he deemed [...] "damn fool suggestions", but the Association threatened to fire him if he did not complete the coin. Borglum was concerned the reverse was still too crowded, and proposed leaving off the eagle, but space was saved when Coolidge did not like the reference to Harding, and it was omitted. [...] With the eagle still in place on the reverse, Fraser finally approved the designs on October 10, 1924. [...] In all, Borglum made nine plaster models for the design.|$|E
500|$|As {{the crowds}} outside the stadium {{continued}} to grow, local police stations were mobilised, {{but by the}} time officers arrived the crowd was too large for them to take any effective form of action. At 2:15pm, the crowds outside the stadium rushed at the barriers and forced their way in. Spectators in the lower tiers had to climb the fences to escape the crush and overflowed onto the pitch itself. Spectator Terry Hickey said later that [...] "To put <b>it</b> <b>mildly,</b> the whole thing was a bloody shambles". The crowd was officially reported as 126,047, but estimates of the actual number of fans in attendance range from 150,000 to over 300,000. [...] The FA refunded 10% of the total gate money to fans who had pre-purchased tickets but were unable to reach their assigned seats. [...] The roads around the stadium were blocked and the Bolton players were forced to abandon their coach a mile from the stadium and make their way through the crowds. The Times stated that at one point it seemed impossible that the match would ever be able to start, but that when King George V arrived, the mood of the crowd changed. After enthusiastically singing [...] "God Save The King", the crowd began to assist the authorities in clearing the playing area.|$|E

2500|$|After Capp {{quit his}} {{ghosting}} job on Ham Fisher's Joe Palooka in 1934 to launch his own strip, Fisher badmouthed him to colleagues and editors, claiming that Capp had [...] "stolen" [...] his idea.

[...] Martin Gottfried wrote: [...] "The concept behind 'Follies' is theater nostalgia, representing the rose-colored glasses through which we face the fact of age ... the show is conceived in ghostliness. At its very start, ghosts of Follies showgirls stalk the stage, mythic giants in winged, feathered, black and white opulence. Similarly, ghosts of Twenties shows slip through the evening as the characters try desperately to regain their youth through re-creations of their performances and inane theater sentiments of their past." ...|$|E

Club gave the episode a C-, the lowest grade given by the website to the show thus far: [...] "The show is so stupid that it thinks we're stupid, prays we're stupid; cross its fingers and hopes like hell that its legion of loyal, obsessive followers will rend their garments at the horrible death of a fan favorite, but still be back next week." [...] According to Stuart Jeffries of The Guardian, [...] "This was, to put <b>it</b> <b>mildly,</b> uncomfortable viewing: 45-plus minutes of torture porn mingled with something even more unpalatable ... this wasn't so much entertainment as psychic evisceration for us." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of Vox wrote, [...] "I've {{had a lot of}} issues with The Walking Dead of late — especially with that genuinely terrible season six finale — but I probably still would have called myself, in general, a “fan” of the show until tonight". Brian Lowry from CNN also criticized the episode: [...] "Nevertheless, its most admirable qualities have increasingly been overshadowed by its more distasteful ones -- not merely in demonstrating just how brutal humanity can be, but by toying with its audience." [...] Jeff Stone of IndieWire wrote in his review, [...] "It was miserable, and tedious, and made me feel bad. Not in an emotionally compelling way, just in a 'I could be watching something of value' way", and he graded the episode D-. Kristi Turnquist of The Oregonian was also critical: [...] "The most shocking reveal was just how low executive producer and showrunner Scott M.
