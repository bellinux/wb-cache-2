5|$|In 1622, several parishioners of Boxgrove, near Chichester in west Sussex, were {{prosecuted for}} playing cricket in a churchyard on Sunday, 5 May. There were three {{reasons for the}} prosecution: one was that it contravened a local bye-law; another {{reflected}} concern about church windows {{which may or may}} not have been broken; the third was that a little childe <b>had</b> <b>like</b> to have her braines beaten out with a cricket batt! The latter reason was because the rules at the time allowed the batsman to hit the ball twice and so fielding near the batsman was very hazardous, as the incidents involving Jasper Vinall and Henry Brand were to drastically confirm.|$|E
5|$|In the whaleboat, Melville <b>had,</b> <b>like</b> De Long, ridden out {{the storm}} {{by means of a}} sea anchor. The boat's course was far to the south of De Long's; they finally reached land at one of the main mouths of the Lena, and were able to {{navigate}} upriver. Within a few days they encountered a native fishing camp, and by September 25 had reached the settlement of Arrhu. Chipp's cutter never reached land; overwhelmed by the storm, it presumably foundered, with the loss of all eight on board.|$|E
5|$|One word {{more about}} the bawdy, and I have done. I own the first night this thing was acted, some indecencies <b>had</b> <b>like</b> to have happened, {{but it was not}} my fault. The fine gentleman of the play, {{drinking}} his mistress's health in Nantes brandy from six in the morning to the time he waddled upon the stage in the evening, had toasted himself up to such a pitch of vigour, I confess I once gave Amanda for gone.|$|E

5|$|The 2011 season had a minor hiccup at {{the very}} {{beginning}} with a two-point loss to the Blues. Their second round match against the Hurricanes was cancelled, and match declared a draw after the Christchurch earthquake on 22 February which caused 182 deaths. In their first match after the earthquake they played the Waratahs, a team that had only conceded six points in their previous two games. The Crusaders triumphed 33–18 in a convincing display in front of a sold-out stadium. They next played the Brumbies and brushed them aside in a 52–10 demolition. They next played the Highlanders who had previously only lost one match in the season, to the undefeated and table-topping Stormers. The Crusaders won comfortably 44–13 in Dunedin. The next team they played, the Sharks, <b>had</b> <b>like</b> the Highlanders previously only lost one match in the season before the Crusaders won 44–28 at Twickenham for a one off match due to earthquake damage at their own ground. They played the second match in Timaru Alpine Stadium against the Bulls in a sell out crowd winning 27–0. Round 9 they played the Chiefs in Mt Maunganui and gained four tries winning 34–16 with Richie McCaw returning after eight weeks off with injury.|$|E
25|$|On 19 March 2015, Williamson ordained Jean-Michel Faure, {{a former}} member of the SSPX, as a bishop in a {{ceremony}} in Nova Friburgo, Brazil. Faure <b>had,</b> <b>like</b> Williamson, opposed reconciliation discussions between the Society and the Vatican. As this was without papal mandate, both Faure and Williamson (again) have incurred a latae sententiae excommunication.|$|E
25|$|When war resumed, Britain {{once again}} {{attacked}} the French possessions in the West Indies. The French armies {{which had been}} sent to recover Haiti in 1803 <b>had,</b> <b>like</b> the British armies earlier, been ravaged by disease, so only isolated garrisons opposed the British forces. In 1805, as part of the manoeuvres which ultimately led to the Battle of Trafalgar, a French fleet carrying 6,500 troops briefly captured Dominica and other islands but subsequently withdrew.|$|E

25|$|In 2000, the Court heard Carter v. United States, {{on appeal}} from an {{unpublished}} {{decision of the}} Third Circuit. The petitioner, convicted of bank robbery, <b>had,</b> <b>like</b> Schmuck, been denied a jury instruction on a lesser included offense at trial. Since he had not used force once in the bank, {{he argued that the}} jury should have been allowed to consider convicting him of bank larceny instead. By another 5–4 vote, the conviction was affirmed.|$|E
25|$|Eden's {{great-grandfather}} was William Iremonger who {{commanded the}} 2nd Regiment of Foot during the Peninsular War, fighting under Wellington (as he became) at Vimiero. He was also descended from Governor Sir Robert Eden, 1st Baronet, of Maryland, the Calvert Family of Maryland, the Schaffalitzky de Muckadell family of Denmark, and Bie family of Norway. Eden was once amused {{to learn that}} one of his ancestors <b>had,</b> <b>like</b> Churchill’s ancestor the Duke of Marlborough, been the lover of Barbara Castlemaine.|$|E
25|$|Brigadier-General Arthur W. Vanaman, {{the highest-ranking}} USAAF officer {{captured}} in the European Theatre of Operations. Vanaman, an intelligence officer, succeeded Spivey as SAO in mid-1944. He <b>had</b> (<b>like</b> Spivey) been captured after flying as an observer on a bombing mission. The crew had advised Vanaman to bale out after his aircraft {{had been hit by}} flak and filled with smoke. This, ironically, had been caused by the ignition of a harmless smoke marker and the bomber had returned to base safely.|$|E

Darcel D. Clark has been the Bronx County District Attorney since 2016. Her predecessor was Robert T. Johnson, was the District Attorney from 1989 to 2015. He was the first African-American District Attorney in New York State.|$|E
25|$|Advanced Micro Devices was {{formally}} incorporated on May 1, 1969, by Jerry Sanders, along with seven {{of his colleagues}} from Fairchild Semiconductor. Sanders, an electrical engineer who {{was the director of}} marketing at Fairchild, <b>had</b> <b>like</b> many Fairchild executives, grown frustrated with the increasing lack of support, opportunity, and flexibility within that company, and decided to leave to start his own semiconductor company. The previous year Robert Noyce, who had invented the first practical integrated circuit or the microchip in 1959 at Fairchild, had left Fairchild together with Gordon Moore and founded the semiconductor company Intel in July 1968.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{his work}} on Just a Minute, Merton was a semi-regular guest on I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue from 1991 to 1998. Between 1993 and 1995, Merton was among the regular cast members on the Radio 4 improvisational comedy series The Masterson Inheritance. In 2000 he {{presented}} Two Priests and a Nun Go into a Pub, in which he interviewed British and Irish comedians who <b>had</b> (<b>like</b> Merton himself) been brought up {{as members of the}} Roman Catholic Church. In 2009, Merton started a Radio 4 series in which he reads Spike Milligan's war memoirs in an audio-book fashion.|$|E

25|$|Sakuraba's {{victory over}} Royler {{constituted}} the first loss by a Gracie in professional fighting in several decades and as such, sent ripples {{of shock and}} controversy through the mixed martial arts community. Some protested that the victory was tainted {{due to the fact}} that Royler (although placed in a debilitating submission hold) never conceded defeat and was little time away from the final bell when the bout was stopped. It is worth noting that the last Japanese athlete to defeat a Gracie prior to Sakuraba's win against Royler, legendary judoka Masahiko Kimura, had used the very same technique Sakuraba utilized to beat Royler. That time, the recipient had been Royler's father, Hélio Gracie, who <b>had,</b> <b>like</b> Royler, also refused to submit but likewise lost.|$|E
25|$|This fortuitous {{collaboration}} came to {{an abrupt}} end with Mulligan's arrest on narcotics charges in mid-1953 leading to six months at Sheriff's Honor Farm. Both Mulligan and Baker <b>had,</b> <b>like</b> many of their peers, become heroin addicts. However, while Mulligan was in prison, Baker transformed his lyrical trumpet style, gentle tenor voice and matinee-idol looks into independent stardom. Thus when upon his release Mulligan attempted to rehire Baker, the trumpeter declined the offer for financial reasons. They did briefly reunite at the 1955 Newport Jazz Festival and would occasionally get together for performances and recordings up through a 1974 performance at Carnegie Hall. But in later years their relationship became strained as Mulligan, with considerable effort, would manage to kick his habit, while Baker's addiction bedevilled him professionally and personally almost constantly until his death in 1988.|$|E
25|$|Rehnquist {{then turned}} to the merits of the case. After recounting in some detail Doyle's history of intemperate {{behavior}} in his years at Mt. Healthy and the contact with the radio station, he rejected the board's argument that Roth barred Doyle's claim since he did not have tenure. Instead he followed Roths companion case, Perry v. Sindermann, another case Gottesman had argued, with distinct similarities to Doyle's. In Perry, a Texas public junior college professor who <b>had,</b> <b>like</b> Doyle, been president of a faculty organization that clashed with the administration, challenged the nonrenewal of his contract. In contrast to Roth, the Court had ruled that he had alleged enough facts to make an arguable case that the nonrenewal was retaliatory action for his speech on a matter of public concern, and so it would for Doyle.|$|E

Yule later stated that, although he would <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> being considered at least, he would have declined anyway because of family priorities.|$|R
25|$|Since Alberto-Culver <b>had,</b> <b>like</b> Byrd, {{made their}} claim under the 1934 Act, Justice Potter Stewart {{had made the}} same point that the two {{statutes}} were not identical, but accepted it for argument's sake to hold that it was irrelevant since arbitration was desirable in that case due to the international nature of the dispute. In a dissent that both White and Marshall signed, William O. Douglas countered that the 1934 Act was remedial legislation which the Court had, as such, previously held was to be construed broadly. Further, against Stewart's semantic criticisms, Douglas had reiterated Wilkos misgivings about the shortcomings of arbitration, such {{as a lack of}} discovery or appellate review and the possibility that an arbitrator would have a poor understanding of the relevant law. White did not take either side in his concurrence, but reminded his colleagues that the question had not been resolved.|$|E
