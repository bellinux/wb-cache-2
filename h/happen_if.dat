When Kennedy asked if Nhu would blame the US for any resulting military deterioration, Phillips replied that the ARVN would revolt, because the ARVN officers who were on Viet Cong hit lists would not allow the communists to run loose. Phillips said that if Nhu tried to divert military aid away from the troops to prop up his personal schemes, the Americans could deliver the money straight to the countryside in suitcases.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, Christopher McQuarrie visited Berlin while researching {{another project}} and visited the {{memorial}} to von Stauffenberg at the Bendlerblock. Researching the 20 July plot, {{he was moved}} and fascinated {{by the fact that}} the conspirators were fully aware of what would <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> they failed their assassination attempt, and he wanted to make their story more well-known. He approached Nathan Alexander to co-write the film, and Alexander began researching the project. McQuarrie sought to model the story after the 2001 TV film Conspiracy, which depicted the Wannsee Conference at which the Nazis planned the Final Solution. He also sought to direct the film, until he realized that adequate financing would only be secured with Bryan Singer directing.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{as a wife}} an epikleros who {{had little}} estate was {{considered}} a praiseworthy action, and was generally stressed in public speeches. Such an heiress was called an epikleros thessa. If the nearest male relative {{did not wish to}} marry an epikleros who belonged to the lowest income class in Athens, he was required to find her a husband and provide her with a dowry on a graduated scale according to his own income class. This dowry was in addition to her own property and the requirement was designed to ensure that even poor heiresses found husbands. The law also did not stipulate what was to <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> the epikleros was still an infant or too young for consummation of the marriage when she was claimed.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{held that}} it can judicially review the {{exercise}} of prosecutorial power and declare a prosecution to be unconstitutional for breach of constitutional power, for example, if a prosecution is brought in bad faith for an ulterior motive and not to punish an accused person for an offence he or she committed. A prosecution {{can also be found}} to have infringed the accused person's constitutional rights. This may <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> law enforcement officers themselves commit crimes by using agents provocateur in a particularly egregious manner to entrap accused persons into committing crimes, and the Attorney-General elects to prosecute only the accused persons but not the officers, as this may infringe the accused persons' right to equality guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution.|$|E

5|$|The {{relativistic}} Dirac equation {{has problems}} for elements {{with more than}} 137 protons. For such elements, the wave function of the Dirac ground state is oscillatory rather than bound, {{and there is no}} gap between the positive and negative energy spectra, as in the Klein paradox. More accurate calculations taking into account the effects of the finite size of the nucleus indicate that the binding energy first exceeds the limit for elements with more than 173 protons. For heavier elements, if the innermost orbital (1s) is not filled, the electric field of the nucleus will pull an electron out of the vacuum, resulting in the spontaneous emission of a positron; however, this does not <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> the innermost orbital is filled, so that element 173 is not necessarily the end of the periodic table.|$|E
5|$|While {{national}} security concerns were {{cited as the}} grounds for rejection, politics {{played an important role}} as well. The project, and the export issue associated with it, was considered so important that French President Georges Pompidou appealed directly to U.S. President Richard Nixon in 1971 to approve the deal, and Henry Kissinger brought the issue up with President Pompidou in a 1972 meeting. GE reportedly argued at the highest levels that having half of the market was better than having none of it, which they believed would <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> SNECMA pursued the engine on their own without GE's contribution. Nixon administration officials feared that this project could be {{the beginning of the end}} of American aerospace leadership.|$|E
5|$|Choosing {{to support}} a Reason {{will result in a}} {{different}} ending depending on who is chosen, but in each the world is reborn {{in the image of the}} chosen Reason after the Demi-fiend fights Kagutsuchi to prove his resolve. Chiaki and Isamu die before the Demi-fiend begins and give him their blessing in spirit form, while Hikawa accompanies the Demi-fiend into their new world. If Takao's wishes are followed, the Demi-fiend fights Kagutsuchi and the world is returned to its pre-Conception state, resurrecting and restoring all the main characters. If the Demi-fiend rejects Takao's wishes, Kagutsuchi curses him for allowing the world to die and departs, leaving the Demi-fiend as the only survivor in a barren world of demons, trapped as it is until another Conception can <b>happen.</b> <b>If</b> the Demi-fiend fulfills Lucifer's request of collecting the Candelabra from the Fiends, Kagutsuchi attacks him and is destroyed, breaking the Great Will's control over the worlds. After this, Lucifer fights the Demi-fiend to test his strength, then declares him to be the ultimate weapon in the upcoming war against the Great Will.|$|E

5|$|Illicit distilleries were commonplace {{throughout}} the Speyside area from medieval times but were largely made redundant {{with the passing}} of the Excise Act in 1823. It was under this legislation that legal distilleries could be formed, subject to holding a license. Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon, was allegedly instrumental in the passing of this legislation. Although there is no historical record of his involvement in the issue, his tenant, George Smith, who was operating an illicit distillery at the time, became the first person in Glenlivet to apply for and receive a license to legally produce spirit. This would prove to be an unpopular decision; every other distiller was operating illegally at the time and hoping the new Excise Act would be repealed, something which would not <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> some distillers accepted the new law. Threats were made against George Smith, so George Gordon provided Smith with two pistols to be used to ensure both his own safety and that of the distillery. In 1824, The Glenlivet distillery was established at Upper Drumin by George and his youngest son John Gordon Smith.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations with malicious intent could send {{information that could}} enable human civilization to destroy itself, such as powerful computer viruses or {{information on how to}} make extremely potent weapons that humans would not yet be able to use responsibly. While the motives for such an action are unknown, it would require minimal energy use {{on the part of the}} extraterrestrials. According to Musso, however, computer viruses in particular will be nearly impossible unless extraterrestrials possess detailed knowledge of human computer architectures, which would only <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> a human message sent to the stars were protected with little thought to security. Even a virtual machine on which extraterrestrials could run computer programs could be designed specifically for the purpose, bearing little relation to computer systems commonly used on Earth. In addition, humans could send messages to extraterrestrials detailing that they do not want access to the Encyclopædia Galactica until they have reached a suitable level of technological advancement, thus mitigating harmful impacts of extraterrestrial technology.|$|E
