Groups also keep their members informed through emails with updates to the group, including most talked about discussions within your professional circles. Groups may be private, accessible to members only or may be open to Internet users in general to read, though they must join in order to post messages.|$|E

The individual learning space could be supported by providing an online <b>discussion</b> <b>area</b> for each video, where students can post summaries of the video, or questions they have regarding the theory. Student-compiled summaries and explanations could augment those compiled by the lecturer. As the complexity of the subject defies singular applications, this could be a valuable forum in which to share initial ideas, using the business examples in the video, and posting questions. The lecturer could provide answers to such questions in the forum. Emotional/Learner presences would be fostered in the collaborative spaces through sharing learning experiences and the underlying emotions.|$|E
