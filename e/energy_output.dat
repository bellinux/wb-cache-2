5|$|Stars {{generate}} {{energy by}} the nuclear fusion of elements. Unlike the Sun, massive stars possess the mass needed to fuse elements {{that have an}} atomic mass greater than hydrogen and helium, albeit at increasingly higher temperatures and pressures, causing increasingly shorter stellar life spans. The degeneracy pressure of electrons and the energy generated by these fusion reactions are sufficient to counter {{the force of gravity}} and prevent the star from collapsing, maintaining stellar equilibrium. The star fuses increasingly higher mass elements, starting with hydrogen and then helium, progressing up through the periodic table until a core of iron and nickel is produced. Fusion of iron or nickel produces no net <b>energy</b> <b>output,</b> so no further fusion can take place, leaving the nickel-iron core inert. Due to the lack of <b>energy</b> <b>output</b> creating outward pressure, equilibrium is broken and the core is compressed by the overlying mass of the star.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{show that}} spatial {{correlation}} of renewable <b>energy</b> <b>outputs</b> greatly influences the robustness of power grids. First, we propose a new index for the spatial correlation among renewable <b>energy</b> <b>outputs.</b> We find that the spatial correlation of renewable <b>energy</b> <b>outputs</b> in a short time-scale is as weak as that caused by independent random variables and that in a long time-scale is as strong as that under perfect synchronization. Then, by employing the topology of the power grid in eastern Japan, we analyze the robustness of the power grid with spatial correlation of renewable <b>energy</b> <b>outputs.</b> The analysis is performed by using a realistic differential-algebraic equations model and the result shows that the spatial correlation of the energy resources strongly degrades the robustness of the power grid. Our result suggests that the spatial correlation of the renewable <b>energy</b> <b>outputs</b> {{should be taken into}} account when estimating the stability of power grids...|$|R

5|$|While most of {{the large}} {{hydropower}} plants in Russia date from the Soviet era, the abundance of fossil fuels in the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation has resulted in little need {{for the development of}} other renewable energy sources. There are currently plans to develop all types of renewable energy, which is strongly encouraged by the Russian government. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has called for renewable energy to have a larger share of Russia's <b>energy</b> <b>output,</b> and has taken steps to promote the development of renewable energy in Russia since 2008.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{nearly half}} the {{hydrogen}} at the core has been consumed, with {{the remainder of the}} atoms consisting primarily of helium. As the number of hydrogen atoms per unit mass decreases, so too does their <b>energy</b> <b>output</b> provided through nuclear fusion. This results in a decrease in pressure support, which causes the core to contract until the increased density and temperature bring the core pressure into equilibrium with the layers above. The higher temperature causes the remaining hydrogen to undergo fusion at a more rapid rate, thereby generating the energy needed to maintain the equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|Comparing {{the driver}} energy input to the fusion <b>energy</b> <b>output</b> {{produces}} a number known as fusion energy gain factor, labelled Q. A Q value {{of at least}} 1 {{is required for the}} system to produce net energy. Since some energy is needed to run the reactor, in order for there to be net electrical output, Q has to be at least 3. For commercial operation, Q values much higher than this are needed. For ICF, Qs on the order of 25 to 50 are needed to recoup both the electrical generation losses and the large amount of power used to power the driver. In the fall of 1960, theoretical work carried out at LLNL suggested that gains of the required order would be possible with drivers on the order of 1MJ.|$|E

5|$|Early work on {{this new}} {{category}} of nova was performed during the 1930s by Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky at Mount Wilson Observatory. They identified SAndromedae, what they considered a typical supernova, as an explosive event that released radiation approximately equal to the Sun's total <b>energy</b> <b>output</b> for 107 years. They decided to call this new class of cataclysmic variables super-novae, and postulated that the energy was generated by the gravitational collapse of ordinary stars into neutron stars. The name super-novae was first used in a 1931 lecture at Caltech by Zwicky, then used publicly in 1933 {{at a meeting of}} the American Physical Society. By 1938, the hyphen had been lost and the modern name was in use.|$|E
5|$|Flow-dominated eruptions are {{long-lived}} {{events that}} build up extensive, compound lava flows. The extent of these flows makes them a major terrain type on Io. In {{this style of}} eruption, magma emerges onto the surface from vents {{on the floor of}} paterae, vents surrounding paterae, or from fissures on the plains, producing inflated, compound lava flows similar to those seen at Kīlauea in Hawaii. Images from the Galileo spacecraft revealed that many of Io's major flows, like those at Prometheus and Amirani, are produced by the build-up of small breakouts of lava on top of older flows. Flow-dominated eruptions differ from explosion-dominated eruptions by their longevity and their lower <b>energy</b> <b>output</b> per unit of time. Lava erupts at a generally steady rate, and flow-dominated eruptions can last for years or decades.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the belief that}} an extraterrestrial civilization would want to establish an empire, Ćirković proposes that an extraterrestrial civilization would maintain equilibrium rather than expand outward. In such an equilibrium, a civilization would only colonize a small number of stars, aiming to maximize efficiency rather than to expand massive and unsustainable imperial structures. This contrasts with the classic Kardashev Type III civilization, which has access to the <b>energy</b> <b>output</b> of an entire galaxy and is not subject to any limits on its future expansion. According to this view, advanced civilizations may not resemble the classic examples in science fiction, but might more closely reflect the small, independent Greek city-states, with an emphasis on cultural rather than territorial growth.|$|E

5|$|When a {{continuous}} spectrum of energy is {{passed through a}} gas or plasma, some of the photons are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to change their energy level. Those excited electrons that remain bound to their atom spontaneously emit this energy as a photon, traveling in a random direction, and so drop back to lower energy levels. Thus the atoms behave like a filter that forms a series of dark absorption bands in the <b>energy</b> <b>output.</b> (An observer viewing the atoms from a view {{that does not include}} the continuous spectrum in the background, instead sees a series of emission lines from the photons emitted by the atoms.) Spectroscopic measurements of the strength and width of atomic spectral lines allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined.|$|E
5|$|Gamma-ray bursts {{are very}} bright as {{observed}} from Earth despite their typically immense distances. An average long GRB has a bolometric flux comparable to a bright star {{of our galaxy}} despite a distance of billions of light years (compared to a few tens of light years for most visible stars). Most of this energy is released in gamma rays, although some GRBs have extremely luminous optical counterparts as well. GRB 080319B, for example, was accompanied by an optical counterpart that peaked at a visible magnitude of 5.8, {{comparable to that of}} the dimmest naked-eye stars despite the burst's distance of 7.5 billion light years. This combination of brightness and distance implies an extremely energetic source. Assuming the gamma-ray explosion to be spherical, the <b>energy</b> <b>output</b> of GRB 080319B would be within a factor of two of the rest-mass energy of the Sun (the energy which would be released were the Sun to be converted entirely into radiation).|$|E
5|$|In 1666, Isaac Newton {{observed}} the Sun's light using a prism, {{and showed that}} it {{is made up of}} light of many colors. In 1800, William Herschel discovered infrared radiation beyond the red part of the solar spectrum.

In {{the early years of the}} modern scientific era, the source of the Sun's energy was a significant puzzle. Lord Kelvin suggested that the Sun is a gradually cooling liquid body that is radiating an internal store of heat. Kelvin and Hermann von Helmholtz then proposed a gravitational contraction mechanism to explain the <b>energy</b> <b>output,</b> but the resulting age estimate was only 20 million years, well short of the time span of at least 300 million years suggested by some geological discoveries of that time.

40|$|This {{research}} {{entails the}} synthesis and characterization {{of a novel}} class of materials which incorporate both magnetic and piezoelectric characteristics. The composite {{is made up of}} the piezoelectric polymer PVDF and magnetic nanoparticles. The testing samples are produced using a spin casting process. The characterizations of the samples were performed using X-ray diffraction, Atomic force microscopy, linear staging, Dynamic mechanical analysis, Differential scanning calorimetry, and Fourier transform Infra-Red. X-ray diffraction and Atomic force microscopy showed that the presence of the Fe 3 O 4 particles have no effect on the crystallinity of the polymer matrix, therefore allowing for the incorporation of inclusions without directly affecting the piezoelectric property. Changes in the thermal characteristics of the polymer matrix, observed using Differential scanning calorimetry, indicated increases in the thermal conductivity of the composite. Decreases in the heat of melting and crystallization were also observed and further solidified the conclusion that the presence of the Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles changes the thermal behavior of the polymer. It was observed from the DMA results caused an increase in the storage modulus of the polymer matrix which is related to an increase in the material's ability to store energy. Linear staging results showed that the presence of the nanoparticles had an effect on the mechanical properties of the composites and altered the time dependent voltage output readings. These results were used to calculate the energy capabilities of the composite material and {{it was found that the}} composites showed greater <b>energy</b> <b>outputs</b> with increasing amounts of nanoparticles. Interaction was observed between the embedded particles and an external magnetic field, which was found to decrease the <b>energy</b> <b>outputs</b> of the composites. This research showed enhancements in the composite material's <b>energy</b> <b>outputs</b> in comparison to the pure PVDF samples. This research also showed that the embedded nanoparticles interacted with an exteriorly applied magnetic field. This observation introduces a new dimension of possible activation processes for piezoelectric devices which have been largely based on physical forms of activation. PVDF which is widely used in research and applications for its superior output capabilities has been enhanced in this research and shown to have capabilities to exhibit higher <b>energy</b> <b>outputs...</b>|$|R
5|$|President Dmitry Medvedev {{announced}} in May 2010 that the Russian government would strongly consider purchasing electricity generated from {{renewable energy sources}} {{in an attempt to}} encourage development of renewable energy.

Medvedev {{announced in}} late 2009 that he wanted to cut Russian energy consumption by 40% by 2020.

5|$|The {{result of}} this process has been a steady {{increase}} in the <b>energy</b> <b>output</b> of the Sun. When the Sun first became a main sequence star, it radiated only 70% of the current luminosity. The luminosity has increased in a nearly linear fashion to the present, rising by 1% every 110 million years. Likewise, in three billion years the Sun {{is expected to be}} 33% more luminous. The hydrogen fuel at the core will finally be exhausted in five billion years, when the Sun will be 67% more luminous than at present. Thereafter the Sun will continue to burn hydrogen in a shell surrounding its core, until the luminosity reaches 121% above the present value. This marks the end of the Sun's main sequence lifetime, and thereafter it will pass through the subgiant stage and evolve into a red giant.|$|E
5|$|The Solar System {{will remain}} roughly {{as we know}} it today until the {{hydrogen}} in the core of the Sun has been entirely converted to helium, which will occur roughly 5 billion years from now. This will mark the end of the Sun's main-sequence life. At this time, the core of the Sun will collapse, and the <b>energy</b> <b>output</b> will be much greater than at present. The outer layers of the Sun will expand to roughly 260 times its current diameter, and the Sun will become a red giant. Because of its vastly increased surface area, the surface of the Sun will be considerably cooler (2,600 K at its coolest) than it is on the main sequence. The expanding Sun is expected to vaporize Mercury and render Earth uninhabitable. Eventually, the core will be hot enough for helium fusion; the Sun will burn helium for a fraction of the time it burned hydrogen in the core. The Sun is not massive enough to commence the fusion of heavier elements, and nuclear reactions in the core will dwindle. Its outer layers will move away into space, leaving a white dwarf, an extraordinarily dense object, half the original mass of the Sun but only the size of Earth. The ejected outer layers will form what is known as a planetary nebula, returning some of the material that formed the Sun—but now enriched with heavier elements like carbon—to the interstellar medium.|$|E

Using two data sets, a unique China’s approved ODI {{and a new}} ODI data set in OECD-IMF standard, we identify some conventional determinants and discover some interesting results of China’s ODI activities in Africa. China’s ODI seeks the African market, invests more when the local currency is relatively cheap, and prefers to go to countries with better economic conditions. In contrast to conventional wisdom, more corruption seems to draw increased ODI from China. China’s ODI targets African energy by implementing two discrete, yet ordered steps: First, it assesses and selects which country to invest in – at this stage, <b>energy</b> <b>outputs</b> in a country {{does not affect the}} probability of receiving China’s ODI.

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{changes in}} the energy return on investment (EROI) for five large petroleum fields over time using the Oil Production Greenhouse Gas Emissions Estimator (OPGEE). The modeled fields include Cantarell (Mexico), Forties (U. K.), Midway-Sunset (U. S.), Prudhoe Bay (U. S.), and Wilmington (U. S.). Data on field properties and production/processing parameters were obtained {{from a combination of}} government and technical literature sources. Key areas of uncertainty include details of the oil and gas surface processing schemes. We aim to explore how long-term trends in depletion at major petroleum fields change the effective energetic productivity of petroleum extraction. Four EROI ratios are estimated for each field as follows: The net energy ratio (NER) and external energy ratio (EER) are calculated, each using two measures of <b>energy</b> <b>outputs,</b> (1) oil-only and (2) all <b>energy</b> <b>outputs.</b> In all cases, engineering estimates of inputs are used rather than expenditure-based estimates (including off-site indirect energy use and embodied energy). All fields display significant declines in NER over the modeling period driven by a combination of (1) reduced petroleum production and (2) increased energy expenditures on recovery methods such as the injection of water, steam, or gas. The fields studied had NER reductions ranging from 46 % to 88 % over the modeling periods (accounting for all <b>energy</b> <b>outputs).</b> The reasons for declines in EROI differ by field. Midway-Sunset experienced a 5 -fold increase in steam injected per barrel of oil produced. In contrast, Prudhoe Bay has experienced nearly a 30 -fold increase in amount of gas processed and reinjected per unit of oil produced. In contrast, EER estimates are subject to greater variability and uncertainty due to the relatively small magnitude of external energy investments in most cases...|$|R

The main contributing factor to below-average activity was much above-average wind shear across the Pacific basin. Overall <b>energy</b> <b>output</b> was reflected with an Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index of 52 units, well below the 1981–2010 average of 113.3 units, and at the time the second-lowest value observed since reliable records began in 1971.
