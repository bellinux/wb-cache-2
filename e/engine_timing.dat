50|$|A belt {{tensioner}} is a device designed to maintain {{tension in the}} <b>engine’s</b> <b>timing</b> belt. There is a spring device in the {{belt tensioner}} where the bearing is located. The spring device oscillates back and forth at 2° for about 60 cycles per minute.|$|R
5000|$|... 1975 The Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9 W116 {{replaces the}} air {{suspension}} of the 6.3 with hydropneumatic suspension, with the pump driven by the <b>engine's</b> <b>timing</b> chain instead of an external belt. This adaptation was used only for the suspension. Power steering and brakes were conventional hydraulic- and vacuum-powered, respectively.|$|R
40|$|A {{principle}} of best <b>engine</b> valve <b>timing</b> is proposed {{based on the}} requirements of best <b>engine</b> valve <b>timing.</b> A novel variable valve timing system is designed according to the principle. The construction of the mathematical model {{of the system and}} its dynamic simulation are also presented. The adjust performance of system and the oil pressure are studied in the paper. Simulation and experimental results show that the system can achieve fully variable valve timing adjustment by regulating electromagnetic valve closing time according to the engine speed, and the system satisfies the {{principle of}} best <b>engine</b> valve <b>timing</b> proposed in the paper...|$|R
50|$|<b>Engine</b> <b>timing</b> was by chain. The {{flywheel}} and gearbox {{formed a}} single unit {{with the engine}} which was slightly inclined and held to the chassis at four points on rubber.|$|E
5000|$|Poor or {{unregulated}} <b>engine</b> <b>timing</b> {{is often}} a cause of intake backfires, but can also be responsible for exhaust backfires. Backfires and loud explosion-like sounds are common when anti-lag is active ...|$|E
50|$|The SuperFIRE {{features}} a unique control {{system of the}} <b>engine</b> <b>timing</b> distribution: A toothed belt drives the camshaft of the exhaust valves, which in turn drives the intake camshaft via a gear.|$|E
5000|$|Camshaft in most engines. On many <b>engines</b> with <b>timing</b> gears, the {{camshaft}} is timed.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantage}} of a rotary valve is that it enables the two-stroke <b>engine's</b> intake <b>timing</b> to be asymmetrical, which is not possible with piston-port type engines. The piston-port type <b>engine's</b> intake <b>timing</b> opens and closes before and after top dead center at the same crank angle, making it symmetrical, whereas the rotary valve allows the opening to begin and close earlier.|$|R
50|$|In a spark {{ignition}} engine, a mixture is ignited by an electric spark from {{a spark plug}} — the timing of which is very precisely controlled. Almost all gasoline engines are of this type. Diesel <b>engines</b> <b>timing</b> is precisely controlled by the pressure pump and injector.The normal plug distance between the spark plug is 1mm apart, and the voltage is 3000v at normal atmospheric conditions.|$|R

5000|$|The Outback came {{standard}} with a [...] by SAE, 4-cylinder boxer engine, four-cylinder SOHC {{design with}} a maximum torque of (166 lbft Nm) that was available at a lower RPM compared to the previous generation. The 2.5 L SOHC four-cylinder <b>engine</b> uses a <b>timing</b> belt that must be replaced around 100000 mi, whereas the 3.0 L six-cylinder <b>engine</b> uses a <b>timing</b> chain that doesn't require replacement under normal conditions.|$|R
50|$|The car {{made its}} debut at the 1989 IMSA Miami GTP race (car #99), but retired from the event with an <b>engine</b> <b>timing</b> belt malfunction. The team {{concentrated}} its efforts on the #98 car; AAR would not enter the HF89 until the Lime Rock GTP race. The car then completed its first race with a 5th-place finish at the following event at the Mid-Ohio GTP race. The HF89 did not finish any other races that season.|$|E
5000|$|The six-cylinder 2½-litre engine has {{inclined}} {{overhead valves}} {{on either side}} of the cylinder head. They are opened by rockers operated by a single overhead camshaft which is driven by double roller chain. The S.U. carburettor is bolted to the cylinder head which may be removed with the valve train without affecting <b>engine</b> <b>timing.</b> The crankshaft has been given four bearings. The pistons are of aluminium and the connecting rods are steel. Cooling water circulates by pump.|$|E
50|$|Most engine {{systems have}} {{idle speed control}} built into the ECU. The engine RPM is {{monitored}} by the crankshaft position sensor which plays a primary role in the <b>engine</b> <b>timing</b> functions for fuel injection, spark events, and valve timing. Idle speed is controlled by a programmable throttle stop or an idle air bypass control stepper motor. Early carburetor-based systems used a programmable throttle stop using a bidirectional DC motor. Early Throttle body injection (TBI) systems used an idle air control stepper motor. Effective idle speed control must anticipate the engine load at idle.|$|E
50|$|Viton o-rings are an {{alternative}} to Buna-N seals in BMW's automobile <b>engine</b> variable <b>timing</b> units, known as VANOS. In the VANOS, the Buna-N o-rings deteriorate. The Viton fluorocarbon o-rings have similar functional characteristics to Buna-N, but with much higher temperature and chemical resistance characteristics.|$|R
50|$|This is {{necessary}} because {{in order to}} run smoothly, a cold <b>engine</b> requires different <b>timing</b> and fuel mixture than an engine at operating temperature.|$|R
50|$|Because {{pressure}} and temperature are strongly linked, knock {{can also be}} attenuated by controlling peak combustion chamber temperatures by compression ratio reduction, exhaust gas recirculation, appropriate calibration of the <b>engine's</b> ignition <b>timing</b> schedule, and careful design of the engine's combustion chambers and cooling system as well as controlling the initial air intake temperature.|$|R
50|$|In the {{internal}} combustion engine, this task is performed by cams on a camshaft driving poppet valves, but this arrangement is not commonly used with steam engines, partly because achieving variable <b>engine</b> <b>timing</b> using cams is complicated. Instead, {{a system of}} eccentrics, cranks and levers is generally used to control a D slide valve or piston valve from the motion. Generally, two simple harmonic motions with different fixed phase angles are added in varying proportions to provide an output motion that is variable in phase and amplitude. A variety of such mechanisms have been devised over the years, with varying success.|$|E
50|$|Smaller and quieter V-6s were {{introduced}} in 1991 {{in the form of}} the Evinrude Spitfire and the Johnson Silver-Star series. These outboards featured a new flushing device that could be used to flush the engine with fresh water while it was running. The Spitfire and Silver-Star models also used an infra-red sensor system called Optical Ignition System (OIS 2000). This system automatically advanced the <b>engine</b> <b>timing</b> to eliminate unwanted timing changes. Other advancements in 1991 included smaller, more fuel efficient diesel stern drive models. The OMC Cobra Diesel was a 970-pound, 3.2 liter, six-cylinder monoblock inline powerhouse that produced 205-hp at 4300 rpm.|$|E

50|$|The <b>engine</b> has <b>timing</b> belt change {{interval}} of 180,000 Km as IKCO has announced. IKCO states if {{the engine runs}} only on CNG it will not need any special maintenance until 250,000 km(average) and if the engine runs with both CNG and gasoline {{the number will increase}} to more than 250,000 km.|$|R
5000|$|Using a {{combination}} of fluid-filled struts and nitrogen-filled pressure vessels or [...] "accumulators" [...] in lieu of conventional shock absorbers and springs, the system was pressurized by a hydraulic pump driven by the <b>engine's</b> <b>timing</b> chain. Compared to the new Mercedes-Benz system, Citroën's was belt-driven, exactly like a conventional power steering pump; failure of the Citroën system thus might result in loss of suspension. The 6.9 was shipped with hard rubber emergency dampers that served as temporary springs and allowed the car to be driven {{in the event of}} a hydraulic failure. The special hydraulic fluid required by the system was stored in a tank inside the engine compartment. Ride height could be altered by a dash-mounted push-pull knob under the speedometer that raised the car an additional two inches (50 mm) for increased ground clearance.|$|R
50|$|BorgWarner Inc. is an American {{worldwide}} {{automotive industry}} components and parts supplier. It is primarily {{known for its}} powertrain products, which include manual and automatic transmissions and transmission components, such as electro-hydraulic control components, transmission control units, friction materials, and one-way clutches, turbochargers, <b>engine</b> valve <b>timing</b> system components, along with four-wheel drive system components.|$|R
50|$|One {{critical}} maintenance issue {{specific to}} the Yugo 55 qnd 65 (the 45 was a 903 cc pushrod engine, with a timing chain) was the need for regular replacement of the interference engine's timing belt — every 40000 mi. In a non-interference <b>engine,</b> <b>timing</b> belt failure does not cause further damage to the engine. However, in an interference engine, failure of the timing belt disrupts the synchronization between pistons and poppet valves, causing them to collide with one another (hence the name interference engine), thus potentially destroying the engine. Though this requirement was stressed in owners' manuals, it was frequently overlooked by owners. The factory also {{stressed the need for}} 89-octane fuels for the low-compression engines.|$|E
50|$|<b>Engine</b> <b>timing</b> was {{controlled}} by the all-steel, silent Morse timing chain (some early production engines had double-row roller timing sets), which was located beneath the aluminum timing cover {{at the front of}} the engine block. The timing chain sprockets, one each for the camshaft and crankshaft, were all-steel; for the last few years the LA engine came with nylon teeth on the sprockets. At the rear of the camshaft was cut a set of helical gear teeth, these being used to spin the distributor. Mounted to the front of the timing cover was a new-design counter-clockwise-rotation water pump, with much improved flow. Externally, the accessory drive belt was changed to a serpentine system; coupled with an automatic belt tensioner this increased belt life, reduced maintenance and contributed to lower noise and vibration levels.|$|E
50|$|The air {{compressor}} {{is driven by}} the engine either by crankshaft pulley via a belt or directly from the <b>engine</b> <b>timing</b> gears. It is lubricated and cooled by the engine lubrication and cooling systems. Compressed air is first routed through a cooling coil and into an air dryer which removes moisture and oil impurities and also may include a pressure regulator, safety valve and smaller purge reservoir. As an alternative to the air dryer, the supply system can be equipped with an anti-freeze device and oil separator. The compressed air is then stored in a reservoir (also called a wet tank) from which it is then distributed via a four way protection valve into the front and rear brake circuit air reservoir, a parking brake reservoir and an auxiliary air supply distribution point. The system also includes various check, pressure limiting, drain and safety valves.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the engine}} is 2-stroke, opposed-piston, the engine {{features}} no heads or valves. The two camshafts on the <b>engine</b> provide <b>timing</b> for two injection pumps per cylinder. Porting allows exhaust gases to be expelled and scavenge air {{to be taken in}} by a positive air box pressure. Intake air is provided by an engine driven Roots blower or turbo-supercharger.|$|R

50|$|The SOHC EJ Subaru boxer engines were non-interference engines through 1995, run by {{a single}} timing belt driving both cams (both sides of the engine) and the water pump. Because they are non-interference <b>engines,</b> if the <b>timing</b> belt fails, the engine of the models up to 1995 will not be damaged. The oil pump is driven {{directly}} from the crank shaft and the waterpump by the timing belt. All DOHC and 1998-up SOHC EJ engines are interference <b>engines,</b> if the <b>timing</b> belt fails the valves will likely be damaged.|$|R
