25|$|In September 2003 Persson was diagonosed with hip {{osteoarthritis}} {{and surgery}} was recommended. He {{chose to go}} through Sweden's public health-care system instead of seeking private treatment; he was put on a waiting list, and finally received a hip replacement operation in June 2004. During that 9-month period <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>with</b> a limp and reportedly was on strong painkillers; he had to cancel several official trips due to the pain he was in.|$|E

[...] There his actions increased political opposition to him, and further inquiries were made into his affairs. [...] He also began consorting with Loyalist sympathizers, and married Peggy Shippen, the daughter of one such man. [...] Shortly after, he opened negotiations with British General Sir Henry Clinton, mediated by British Major John André, offering his services to their side.|$|E

500|$|Coloman's father {{ascended the}} throne in 1074. Because Coloman and Álmos were minors {{when he died}} on 25April 1077, Géza's brother Ladislaus I succeeded him. The new king decided that Coloman should be {{prepared}} {{for a career in}} the Church. The king's decision was unusual as Coloman was older than Álmos and elder brothers were rarely ordained priests. The 14th-century Illuminated Chronicle stated that Coloman was [...] "of mean stature, but astute and quick of apprehension", adding that he was [...] "shaggy and hirsute, half-blind and humpbacked, and <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>with</b> a limp and stammered in his speech". If the chronicle preserved genuine tradition of his appearance, his physical deformity may have influenced his uncle's decision. However, modern scholars tend to refute this view, emphasizing that the chronicle was completed in the reigns of kings descending from Álmos.|$|E
2500|$|In 1773, having {{abandoned}} his Church career, Pratt {{made his first}} appearance as an actor under the name 'Courtney Melmoth' at the Smock Alley Theatre, in Dublin, playing Marc Antony in John Dryden's All For Love but with no great success. He then took a theatre company to Drogheda, again with no success, and the theatre closed after three months. In 1774 he appeared as Hamlet at the Covent Garden Theatre but his performance was again judged a failure. One critic wrote that <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>with</b> [...] "a kind of airy swing that rendered his acting at times rather ludicrous." [...] After this he gave up the stage and took to writing full-time although he still continued to take occasional parts opposite his [...] "wife" [...] until around 1781.|$|E
2500|$|Moving then to Burrinjuck, New South Wales in 1928, Ricetti {{managed to}} get some work as a sailor on the Mary Anne, a paddle steamer that worked the Murray River, Murrumbidgee River and Lachlan River. [...] As {{a part of his}} travels he {{followed}} the Murrumbidgee downstream to the Lachlan then upstream to Hillston, New South Wales. [...] From Hillston <b>he</b> <b>walked,</b> <b>with</b> no fixed destination, along the railway line arriving at the fringes of Griffith where a rainstorm forced him to find shelter. [...] Next day exploring where he had stayed the night he found a huge overhanging rock which formed a dry, cave-like area. [...] Nearby there were two reservoirs full of water, fruit and vegetable farms and a rubbish dump which not only had plenty of rabbits, but where he found a shovel, pick head, and axe head for which he made handles from nearby tree branches.|$|E

2500|$|Mapp {{consulted}} on {{and fixed}} multiple cases. Some {{of her most}} noteworthy cases are recorded in James Caulfied's Portraits, Memoirs, and Characters of Remarkable Persons where he recorded an account from October 21, 1736, [...] "On Monday, Mrs. Mapp performed two extraordinary cures; one on a young lady of the Temple, who had several bones out from the knees to her toes, which she put in their proper places: {{and the other on}} a butcher, whose knee-pans were so misplaced that <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>with</b> his knees knocking one against another. Yesterday she performed several other surprising cures; and about one set out for Epsom, and carried with her several crutches, which she calls trophies of honour." [...] At one point, some surgeons tried to fool Mapp and show that she was not skilled by sending her a healthy patient who claimed he had a damaged wrist. This test angered Mapp and she dislocated the patient's wrist and sent him back to the people who had tried to trick her.|$|E
2500|$|John McCain {{would later}} say, [...] "My marriage's {{collapse}} was attributable {{to my own}} selfishness and immaturity more {{than it was to}} Vietnam, and I cannot escape blame by pointing a finger at the war. The blame was entirely mine." [...] Carol McCain later said, [...] "The breakup of our marriage was not caused by my accident or Vietnam or any of those things. I don't know that it might not have happened if John had never been gone. I attribute it more to John turning 40 and wanting to be 25 again than I do to anything else." [...] McCain's biographer Robert Timberg believes that [...] "Vietnam did play a part, perhaps not the major part, but more than a walk-on." [...] According to Carol, her husband's five-year captivity in Vietnam had left him wanting to [...] "make up for lost time", and John put it this way: [...] "I had changed, she had changed ... People who have been apart that much change." [...] Ross Perot later said, [...] "After he came home, <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>with</b> a limp, she [...] walked with a limp. So he threw her over for a poster girl with big money from Arizona [...] and the rest is history." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Genesis flood {{narrative}} has {{similarities to}} ancient flood stories told worldwide. One {{of the closest}} parallels is the Mesopotamian myth of a world flood, recorded in The Epic of Gilgamesh. In the Hebrew Bible flood story (Genesis 6:5-22), God decides to flood the world and start over, due to mankind's sinfulness. However, God sees that a man named Noah was righteous (because <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>with</b> God) and blameless among the people. God instructs Noah to build an ark, and directs him to bring {{at least two of}} every animal inside the boat, along with his family. The flood comes and covers the world. After 40 days, Noah sends a raven to check whether the waters have subsided, then a dove; after exiting the boat, Noah offers a sacrifice to God, who smells [...] "the sweet savour" [...] and promises never to destroy the earth by water again -and making the rainbow a symbol of this promise. Similarly, in the Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh, the bustle of humanity disturbs the gods, who decide to send a flood. Warned by one of the gods, a man named Utnapishtim builds a boat and takes his family and animals inside. After the flood, Utnapishtim sends a dove, then a swallow, then a raven to check whether the waters have subsided. After exiting the boat, Utnapishtim offers a sacrifice to the gods, who smell [...] "the sweet savour" [...] and repent their choice to send the flood.|$|E

2500|$|In {{fulfilment}} of {{the promise}} of peaceful life, symbolized by the pouring of oil upon his head (Leviticus Rabbah x., Midrash Teh. cxxxiii. 1), Aaron's death, {{as described in the}} Haggadah, was of a wonderful tranquility. Accompanied by Moses, his brother, and by Eleazar, his son, Aaron went to the summit of Mount Hor, where the rock suddenly opened before him and a beautiful cave lit by a lamp presented itself to his view. [...] "Take off thy priestly raiment and place it upon thy son Eleazar!" [...] said Moses; [...] "and then follow me." [...] Aaron did as commanded; and they entered the cave, where was prepared a bed around which angels stood. [...] "Go lie down upon thy bed, my brother," [...] Moses continued; and Aaron obeyed without a murmur. Then his soul departed as if by a kiss from God. The cave closed behind Moses as he left; and he went down the hill with Eleazar, with garments rent, and crying: [...] "Alas, Aaron, my brother! thou, the pillar of supplication of Israel!" [...] When the Israelites cried in bewilderment, [...] "Where is Aaron?" [...] angels were seen carrying Aaron's bier through the air. A voice was then heard saying: [...] "The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found on his lips: <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>with</b> me in righteousness, and brought many back from sin" [...] (Malachi 2:6). He died, according to Seder Olam Rabbah ix., R. H. 2, 3a, on the first of Ab." [...] The pillar of cloud which proceeded in front of Israel's camp disappeared at Aaron's death (see Seder 'Olam, ix. and R. H. 2b-3a). The seeming contradiction between Numbers 20:22 et seq. and Deuteronomy 10:6 is solved by the rabbis in the following manner: Aaron's death on Mount Hor was marked by the defeat of the people in a war with the king of Arad, in consequence of which the Israelites fled, marching seven stations backward to Mosera, where they performed the rites of mourning for Aaron; wherefore it is said: [...] "There [...] died Aaron." ...|$|E
