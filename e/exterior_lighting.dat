5|$|Pat Nixon had an {{interest}} in adding artifacts to the Executive Mansion, and built on Jacqueline Kennedy's more publicized efforts. She added more than 600 paintings and furnishings to the White House and its collections, the largest number of acquisitions by any administration. She created the Map Room and renovated the China room, and refurbished nine others. She worked with engineers to develop an <b>exterior</b> <b>lighting</b> system for the entire White House, literally making it glow a soft white. She ordered the flag flown, day and night, even when the president was not there.|$|E

25|$|The revised GS debuted at Monterey Car Week in August 2015. Changes {{include a}} GS 200t variant {{equipped}} with the 2.0-liter 8AR-FTS turbocharged engine to replace the GS 250, and an update to the 3.5-liter V6, now upgraded to 2GR-FKS specification. that uses the Atkinson cycle and features founded on the previous 2GR-FSE motor. Additional changes include revised exterior elements (including front and rear trim, <b>exterior</b> <b>lighting,</b> wheels, and rocker panels), new active safety features, and a revised infotainment system.|$|E
25|$|The {{defensive}} countermeasures of Block I aircraft {{includes the}} AN/ALR-67(V)3 radar warning receiver, the AN/ALE-47 countermeasures dispenser, the AN/ALE-50 towed decoy and the AN/ALQ-165 Airborne Self-Protect Jammer (ASPJ). Block II aircraft replace the ALQ-165 with the AN/ALQ-214 Integrated Defensive Countermeasures (IDECM) system, consisting of internally mounted threat receivers and optional self-protection jammers. Interior and <b>exterior</b> <b>lighting</b> on the Block II {{was changed to}} allow the use of night vision devices. The older ALE-50 decoys are being replaced by ALE-55 towed decoys, which can transmit jamming signals based on data received from the IDECM. The improved AN/ALQ-214 jammer was added on Block II aircraft.|$|E
25|$|State Guards were {{reformed}} {{for internal}} security duties {{to replace the}} National Guardsmen who were federalized and sent overseas. The Civil Air Patrol was established, which enrolled civilian spotters in air reconnaissance, search-and-rescue, and transport. Its Coast Guard counterpart, the Coast Guard Auxiliary, used civilian boats and crews in similar rescue roles. Towers were built in coastal and border towns, and spotters were trained to recognize enemy aircraft. Blackouts were practiced in every city, even those far from the coast. All <b>exterior</b> <b>lighting</b> had to be extinguished, and black-out curtains placed over windows. The main purpose was {{to remind people that}} there was a war on and to provide activities that would engage the civil spirit of millions of people not otherwise involved in the war effort. In large part, this effort was successful, sometimes almost to a fault, such as the Plains states where many dedicated aircraft spotters took up their posts night after night watching the skies in an area of the country that no enemy aircraft of that time could possibly hope to reach.|$|E

500|$|The <b>exterior</b> <b>lighting</b> {{scheme of}} the {{building}} was designed by Quentin Thomas Associates, and consists primarily of white LEDs color-temperature matched to the fluorescent lights used by the interior. [...] Along each floor, the corner spandrel panels feature upward and downward-facing 4,100K LEDs to create the appearance that the length {{of the building}} has been bottom-lit by spotlights. The only major consistently active color element {{can be found at the}} top of the tuned mass damper; a single row of color-changing LEDs that is programmed to commemorate special events. For example, the top would be colored pink for Breast Cancer Awareness Month.|$|E
500|$|That same year, Ralph Pulitzer, who {{had succeeded}} his father Joseph as {{publisher}} of the World, began a drive to raise [...] for an <b>exterior</b> <b>lighting</b> system to illuminate the statue at night. He claimed over 80,000 contributors, but failed to reach the goal. The difference was quietly made up by a gift from a wealthy donor—a fact that was not revealed until 1936. An underwater power cable brought electricity from the mainland and floodlights were placed along the walls of Fort Wood. Gutzon Borglum, who later sculpted Mount Rushmore, redesigned the torch, replacing much of the original copper with stained glass. On December 2, 1916, President Woodrow Wilson pressed the telegraph key that turned on the lights, successfully illuminating the statue.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to new LRVs, San Diego Trolley also slowly retrofitted the SD-100s LRVs with new paint, door sensors & switches, wheelchair lifts, route display signs, and interior & <b>exterior</b> <b>lighting.</b> The oldest model U2 trolleys {{had very little}} {{that can be done}} to improve their functionality or operation as they lacked the overhead equipment compartments found in the SD-100s and S70s, and were planned to be entirely phased out and retired by 2015. Eleven of the U2 cars were sold to the upstart Metrotranvía Mendoza in Mendoza, Argentina; another 29 had been retired by early 2013, and the rest of the U2 trolleys were retired from service in January 2015. [...] Four U2 cars have been preserved: car 1019 at the Rockhill Trolley Museum, car 1008 at the Orange Empire Railway Museum, as well as cars 1017 and 1018 at the Western Railway Museum.|$|E

2500|$|The {{reception}} pavilion {{received a}} complete overhaul. Its exterior metal façade of bronzed aluminum was removed {{and replaced with}} beige limestone. The glass curtain wall received new mechanical louvers. The interior wall coverings of dark wood paneling and bronzed aluminum were replaced with a cream-colored travertine wainscoting topped by a band of polished stone. Fabric covered the walls above the band, and white wooden grills were used to help break up the space. A new terrazzo floor in pastel colors was also installed. The old reception desk was removed, and a new, curvilinear reception desk was emplaced. Displays about where to eat, drink, and shop in downtown Cleveland {{were added to the}} lobby, as were several kiosks where airlines could assist convention-goers in making plane reservations. Six [...] trees were planted inside the lobby to make it more inviting, and new paving and <b>exterior</b> <b>lighting</b> were installed outside the pavilion.|$|E

2500|$|Work on the {{exterior}} of the memorial ended on February 8, 1931. The Grand Chapter of Virginia of Royal Arch Masonry donated the aluminum double-keystone symbol and light {{at the top of the}} building. The fixture, the largest of its kind in the world at the time, was in place by February 1929 but not yet illuminated (as <b>exterior</b> <b>lighting</b> systems were still being installed). The $17,000 light fixture is [...] high, made of aluminum, and has its own independent power supply. Claude Haynes, a steelworker employed on the memorial since 1923 and a member of Alexandria-Washington Lodge No. 22, completed the light by installing the aluminum sheeting on it on February 8. Construction of decorative items, flooring, landscape drainage, marble walls, and plumbing continued throughout 1931 and was expected to be complete by February 1932. Work on the outbuilding housing the memorial's boiler room began in late March 1931. The brick building was constructed by the Temple B. Greenstreet Co. of Washington, D.C., and the brick smokestacks built by the Alphonse Custodis Co. of New York. A steam tunnel [...] square and [...] long carried heat to the building. The outbuilding's two low-pressure boilers and the memorial's interior radiators were supplied and installed by the American Radiator Co. Interior heating and ventilation units and ductwork were provided by the B.F. Sturtevant Co., Benjamin F. Shore Co., and Buffalo Forge Co. Modern thermostats provided by Johnson Service Co. were used to control the heating and cooling. The furnaces used heating oil for fuel, and were installed by the Automatic Heating Corporation of Washington, D.C.|$|E
