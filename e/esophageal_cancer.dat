5|$|In {{its early}} stages, <b>esophageal</b> <b>cancer</b> {{may not have}} any {{symptoms}} at all. When severe, <b>esophageal</b> <b>cancer</b> may eventually cause obstruction of the esophagus, making swallowing of any solid foods very difficult and causing weight loss. The progress of the cancer is staged using a system that measures how far into the esophageal wall the cancer has invaded, how many lymph nodes are affected, and whether there are any metastases {{in different parts of}} the body. <b>Esophageal</b> <b>cancer</b> is often managed with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and may also be managed by partial surgical removal of the esophagus. Inserting a stent into the esophagus, or inserting a nasogastric tube, may also be used to ensure that a person is able to digest enough food and water. , the prognosis for <b>esophageal</b> <b>cancer</b> is still poor, so palliative therapy may also be a focus of treatment.|$|E

25|$|<b>Esophageal</b> <b>cancers</b> are {{typically}} carcinomas {{that arise from}} the epithelium, or surface lining, of the esophagus. Most <b>esophageal</b> <b>cancers</b> {{fall into one of}} two classes: esophageal squamous-cell carcinomas (ESCC), which are similar to head and neck cancer in their appearance and association with tobacco and alcohol consumption—and esophageal adenocarcinomas (EAC), which are often associated with a history of GERD and Barrett's esophagus. A rule of thumb is that a cancer in the upper two-thirds is likely to be ESCC and one in the lower one-third EAC.|$|R

When O'Malley's father is diagnosed with <b>esophageal</b> <b>cancer</b> and a leaking aortic valve, {{he refuses to}} allow Burke to operate on him, instead contacting Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith), Burke's medical school rival. His relationship with Torres is strained when he confronts her about sleeping with Sloan, but he allows her to support him through his father's deteriorating health. Complications from his father's surgery leave him in multi-system organ failure, and his life support is turned off. In an attempt to overcome his grief, O'Malley elopes with Callie to Las Vegas. He later begins to feel that he was mistaken to marry her, and sleeps with Stevens while intoxicated. Stevens confesses that she {{is in love with}} him, so O'Malley considers transferring to a different hospital so he can be faithful to his wife. However, he is ineligible to transfer after failing the intern exams. O'Malley decides to repeat his intern year, and confesses to Torres that he slept with Stevens, leading the two to separate. O'Malley and Stevens embark on a short-lived relationship, only to discover there is no real chemistry between them.|$|E
40|$|An inverse {{association}} between coffee consumption {{and the risk}} of oral, pharyngeal, and <b>esophageal</b> <b>cancers</b> has been suggested in case-control studies, but few results from prospective studies are available. Data from the Miyagi Cohort Study in Japan were used to clarify the {{association between}} coffee consumption {{and the risk of}} these cancers. Information about coffee consumption was obtained from self-administered food frequency questionnaires in 1990. Among 38, 679 subjects aged 40 – 64 years with no previous history of cancer, 157 cases of oral, pharyn-geal, and <b>esophageal</b> <b>cancers</b> were identified during 13. 6 years of follow-up. Hazard ratios were estimated by the Cox proportional hazards regression model. The risk of oral, pharyngeal, and <b>esophageal</b> <b>cancers</b> was inversely associated with coffee consumption. The multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio of these cancers for 1 cups of coffee per day compared with no consumption was 0. 51 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 33, 0. 77). This inverse association was consistent regardless of sex and cancer site and was observed both for subjects who did not drink or smoke and for those who currently drank or smoked at baseline. In conclusion, coffee consumption was associated with a lower risk of oral, pharyngeal, and <b>esophageal</b> <b>cancers,</b> even in the group at high risk of these cancers. carcinoma, squamous cell; coffee; cohort studies; esophageal neoplasms; Japan; mouth neoplasms; pharyngeal neoplasms; risk Abbreviation: CI, confidence interval...|$|R

F. : 1. 641 Screening for genes down-regulated in <b>esophageal</b> <b>cancers</b> (Oncomine database) pinpointed {{programmed}} {{cell death}} 4 (PDCD 4) {{as one of the}} most consistently involved. PDCD 4 is a new putative tumor suppressor gene implicated in cell transformation, tumorigenesis, and invasiveness. Based on such a biological rationale, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the prognostic value of PDCD 4 in <b>esophageal</b> <b>cancers.</b> The immunohistochemical expression of PDCD 4 protein was assessed in 111 consecutive <b>esophageal</b> <b>cancers</b> (63 adenocarcinomas and 48 squamous cell carcinomas) and paired non-cancerous samples. PDCD 4 immunostaining was significantly lower in cancer samples than in non-cancerous mucosa (p< 0. 001). In all cases, the native esophageal epithelium consistently expressed nuclear PDCD 4, which was significantly less expressed (37 / 111 cases) or completely lacking (31 / 111 cases) in the cancer samples. A significant inverse correlation emerged between nuclear PDCD 4 expression and tumor stage (p= 0. 002), pT (p< 0. 001), nodal metastasis (p= 0. 038), and with both vascular (p= 0. 005) and perineural invasion (p= 0. 004). Nuclear PDCD 4 expression was associated with a longer disease-free (p= 0. 011) and overall (p= 0. 021) survival. PDCD 4 expression predicts the patient outcome in <b>esophageal</b> <b>cancers.</b> Additional functional studies should look into the role of PDCD 4 in the multistep process of esophageal oncogenesis also inquiring on the clinical usefulness of the protein expression as prognostic marker in esophageal precancerous lesions...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{fall in the}} {{incidence}} of <b>esophageal</b> squamous cell <b>cancer</b> and noncardia gastric cancers in western countries parallels a concomitant rise in {{the incidence}} of gastric cardia cancer and distal adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. We aimed to investigate the incidence trend of different gastric and <b>esophageal</b> <b>cancers</b> in Kerman, southeast Iran. Methods: The information of all newly diagnosed patients with gastric and <b>esophageal</b> <b>cancers</b> were collected actively from all histopathology departments around the Kerman Province during 1991 – 2002 retrospectively. Results: The annual age standardized incidence risks of <b>esophageal</b> and gastric <b>cancers</b> in Kerman were 1. 9 and 6. 9 per 100, 000 populations. In average, the risks of gastric and <b>esophageal</b> squamous cell <b>cancers</b> were more or less constant, while the risk of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus increased around 11 % annually. Conclusion: The risks of upper gastrointestinal cancers in Kerman Province were quite lower than the average risks in the whole country.

25|$|In the United States, <b>esophageal</b> <b>cancer</b> is the seventh-leading {{cause of}} cancer death among males (making up 4% of the total). The National Cancer Institute {{estimated}} {{there were about}} 18,000 new cases and more than 15,000 deaths from <b>esophageal</b> <b>cancer</b> in 2013 (the American Cancer Society estimated that during 2014, about 18,170 new <b>esophageal</b> <b>cancer</b> cases would be diagnosed, resulting in 15,450 deaths). The squamous-cell carcinoma type is more common among African American males with a history of heavy smoking or alcohol use. Until the 1970s, squamous-cell carcinoma accounted {{for the vast majority of}} esophageal cancers in the United States. In recent decades, incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus (which is associated with Barrett's esophagus) steadily rose in the United States to the point that it has now surpassed squamous-cell carcinoma. In contrast to squamous-cell carcinoma, esophageal adenocarcinoma is more common in Caucasian men (over the age of 60) than it is in African Americans. Multiple reports indicate esophageal adenocarcinoma incidence has increased during the past 20 years, especially in non-Hispanic white men. Esophageal adenocarcinoma age-adjusted incidence increased in New Mexico from 1973 to 1997.
