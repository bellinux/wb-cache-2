25|$|The {{composition}} of the opposing armies explains {{a lot about the}} outcome of the ensuing conflict. The Tibetan soldiers were almost all rapidly impressed peasants, who lacked organisation, discipline, training and motivation. Only a handful of their most devoted units, comprising monks armed usually with swords and jingals, proved to be effective, but they were in such small numbers as to be unable to reverse the tide of battle. This problem was exacerbated by their generals, who seemed <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British and refused to make any aggressive moves against the small and often dispersed column. They also failed conspicuously to properly defend their natural barriers, frequently offering battle in relatively open ground, where Maxim guns and rifle volleys caused great numbers of casualties.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the poor}} reviews given by European {{observers}} to the European-trained Divisions, the Muslim Divisions of the National Revolutionary Army, trained in China (not by westerners) {{and led by}} Ma Clique Muslim generals, frightened the European observers with their appearance and fighting skills in battle. Europeans like Sven Hedin and Georg Vasel were <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> appearance Chinese Muslim NRA divisions made and their ferocious combat abilities. They were trained in harsh, brutal conditions. The 36th Division (National Revolutionary Army), trained entirely in China without any European help, was composed of Chinese Muslims and fought and severely mauled an invading Soviet Russian army during the Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang. The division was lacking in technology and manpower, but badly damanged the superior Russian force.|$|E

He also expressed government's concern for the Islamic development to promote religious harmony and added that the government always pays great attention to religious development and encourages all religions in Taiwan to communicate with one another to promote mutual tolerance and respect and to serve as a driving force for stability, peace and prosperity.

25|$|In {{accordance}} with {{his role as}} founder of the Levites, Levi {{is referred to as}} being particularly pious. The Blessing of Moses, which some textual scholars attribute to a period just before the deuteronomist, speaks about Levi via an allegorical comparison to Moses himself, which hagaddah take to support the characterisation of Levi (and his progeny) as being by far the greatest of his brothers in respect to piety. The apocryphal Prayer of Asenath, which textual scholars believe dates from some time after the first century AD (scholarship in regards to the dating is currently quite contentious, with dates ranging from near the first century, to the fourth or fifth centuries), describes Levi as a prophet and saint, able to forecast the future, understand heavenly writings (astrology? weather trends?), and someone who admonishes the people to be forgiving, as well as in awe of God. The Book of Malachi argues that the Levites were chosen by Yahweh to be the priests, because Levi as minister of God, was specified only the true religious regulations, was reverent, revered Yahweh, was <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> God's name, upheld peace, was a model of good morality, and turned many people from sin.|$|E

Ganino's speculative script, {{submitted to the}} office of pre-production associate Eric A. Stillwell in April 1989, was titled [...] "Yesterday's Enterprise".

The crew of the Enterprise-C is <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> newer ship's technology, and Picard is confronted with whether to reveal to his guests their ultimate fate. An Enterprise-C ensign accidentally discovers the fate of his vessel and panics, requiring Worf and Riker to capture him after he attempts to escape. When Golecian warships attack, Picard defends the Enterprise-C using the same maneuver that caused the vessel's destruction in the past. The ensign goes back to his ship, which returns to the past and its certain destruction.|$|E

Congress regarded his commission as honorary, while he considered himself a full-fledged commander who would be given control of a division when Washington deemed him prepared.

Down 3–2 with 35seconds remaining in regulation, Talbot scored for the Penguins, who had removed goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury to gain an extra skater.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the norms {{and issues of}} Modern Orthodox Judaism in America, from <b>the</b> decades <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twenties to the sixties, {{by looking at the}} activities and involvements of one of its leaders, Rabbi Dr. Leo Jung. <b>The</b> phenomenon <b>of</b> Modern Orthodoxy will be examined in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> Orthodox invigoration and change. The reasons for the changes will be explored. Modern Orthodoxy went from being a threatened entity on the American scene to a well-recognized, respected force in Judaism. Modern Orthodoxy in the twenties lacked hard lines and clear concepts and was floundering as it tried to adjust to its new environment. For the most part, its adherents were transplanted East Europeans, religiously uneducated, unobservant, and <b>in</b> <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> America and <b>the</b> modern world. Rabbi Jung's presentation of Modern Orthodoxy demonstrated that it was relevant and compatible with America and modernity. Modern Orthodox institutions were weak; {{there was a lack of}} adequate facilities necessary for an Orthodox community to exist and a lack of adequately trained educators. This thesis will monitor the efforts to develop and improve facilities and conditions and the responses to political, economic and social situations that impacted on Modern Orthodoxy. By 1960 a foundation had been laid for a movement to the "right" which was marked by <b>the</b> tightening <b>of</b> religious standards, more identification with <b>the</b> tenets <b>of</b> Halakhic Judaism, stricter piety and more distrust <b>of</b> <b>the</b> secular world.
