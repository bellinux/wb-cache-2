40|$|International audienceMicrosporidiosis and {{cryptosporidiosis}} {{are emerging}} opportunistic infections responsible for intestinal manifestations {{that are often}} severe in immunocompromised patients. A case of microsporidiosis-cryptosporidiosis coinfection is reported in an HIV-infected newborn. The patient was a 17 -day-old female, exclusively breastfed and with no contact with animals. Microsporidiosis and cryptosporidiosis were diagnosed after systematic screening in stool samples using both specific staining and PCR. Two species of microsporidia, Encephalitozoon intestinalis and Enterocytozoon bieneusi, and Cryptosporidium hominis were identified. The contamination of the newborn probably resulted from direct human-to-human transmission during close contact with the mother (who had diarrhea and refused stool sampling). This report highlights {{the usefulness of the}} screening of <b>intestinal</b> microsporidiosis and <b>cryptosporidiosis</b> in HIV-infected subjects for better management...|$|R
40|$|This study’s {{objective}} was to search for Crypt sporidium sp. in diarrheic feces from children aged zero to 12 years and cared for at medical units within Universidade Federal de Uberlândia or at a private practice in Uberlândia, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, from September 1992 to August 1993. Three fecal samples preserved in 10 % formalin, were collected from 94 children. Oocyst concentration was performed through Ritchie’s (modified) method and staining of fecal smears for each sample (total of 1128 slides) {{was done by the}} “Safranin/Methylene Blue ” and the “Kinyoun (modified) ” techniques. The Hoffmann, Pons & Janer method was also employed to look for other enteroparasites. From 94 children, 4. 26 % excreted fecal Cryptosporidium oocysts. The infection seemed to vary according to age: 5. 08 % of patients aged zero to two years old; 33. 33 % of those aging eight to ten years (P> 0. 05). Cryptosporidium appeared in November, December and March, during the rainy season. 20. 21 % of the children harbored at least one enteroparasite different from Cryptosporidium, ainly Giardia intestinalis (12. 77 %). From Cryptosporidium infected patients, two had only this kind, another harbored Giardia intestinalis; the last one hosted Strongyloides stercoralis.

40|$|Cryptosporidium parasites infect <b>intestinal</b> cells, causing <b>cryptosporidiosis.</b> Despite {{its high}} {{morbidity}} and as-sociation with stunting {{in the developing}} world, current therapies for cryptosporidiosis have limited efficacy. Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are essential enzymes in the biology of protozoan parasites. CDPK 1 was cloned from the genome of Cryptosporidium parvum, and potent and specific inhibitors have been developed based on structural studies. In this study, we evaluated the anti-Cryptosporidium activity of a novel CDPK 1 inhibitor, 1294, and demonstrated that 1294 significantly reduces parasite infection in vitro, with a half maximal effective concentration of 100 nM. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that 1294 is well absorbed, with a half-life supporting daily administration. Oral therapy with 1294 eliminated Cryptosporidium parasites from 6 of 7 infected severe combined immunodeficiency–beige mice, and the parasites did not recur in these immunosuppressed mice. Mice treated with 1294 had less epithelial damage, corresponding to less apoptosis. Thus, 1294 is an important lead {{for the development of}} drugs for treatment of cryptosporidiosis. Keywords.

We present here a case of this disease in a 23 -year-old Japanese military man with 3 days of abdominal pain, watery diarrhea, and nausea. The frequency of his diarrhea was more than 10 times per day. After his diarrheal bowel symptoms subsided, a colonoscopy was performed because inflammatory bowel disease was suspected. Although the endoscopic findings indicated non-specific ileitis, <b>intestinal</b> <b>cryptosporidiosis</b> was suspected from the histology of ileal biopsy specimens, and this was confirmed ultrastructurally.

Routine practitioners should be encouraged to carefully inspect patients for this disease, supported by detailed knowledge of it and its diagnosis. If stool-examination results are negative or are not obtained at first, histological diagnosis by endoscopic biopsy could be a useful way to screen for <b>intestinal</b> <b>cryptosporidiosis.</b> Furthermore, stool or histological examination should be performed in recovered patients because the oocysts may continue to be shed for 1 to 4 weeks after the symptoms disappear.

Related data on cryptosporidiosis in Taiwanese HIV-infected patients are very limited. This study assessed the prevalence of intestinal infection due to Cryptosporidium spp. among Taiwanese patients with HIV infection. MethodsThis retrospective review included 1044 patients with HIV infection treated between June 1994 and June 2004. Intestinal colonization due to Cryptosporidium spp. was identified by polymerase chain reaction and {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} of stool specimens collected from 332 of the HIV-infected patients without gastrointestinal symptoms, 90 % of whom were receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy. ResultsFive out of 1044 (0. 5 %) HIV-infected patients had a diagnosis of <b>intestinal</b> <b>cryptosporidiosis</b> by endoscopic biopsy or examinations of stool specimens.

However, respiratory signs and symptoms are common in otherwise healthy children with <b>intestinal</b> <b>cryptosporidiosis,</b> which suggests that respiratory infection may occur in immunocompetent hosts. Methods. We recruited children 9 – 36 months of age who presented with diarrhea to Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda, from November 2007 through January 2009. Children with stool samples positive or negative for Cryptosporidium species were selected for further evaluation, including sputum induction in those with cough or unexplained respiratory signs and collection of saliva and blood specimens. Sputum samples were subjected to comprehensive bacteriologic testing, and both sputum and saliva specimens were tested for Cryptosporidium species by nested polymerase chain reaction. Results. Of 926 fecal samples screened, 116 (12. 5 %) were positive for Cryptosporidium. Seventeen (35. 4 %) of 48 sputum samples tested from children with positive stool samples were positive for Cryptosporidium.

40|$|A {{total of}} 534 psittacine and {{passerine}} birds consisting of 241 imported and 293 local birds were examined histologically. As a result, the following parasites were found : Giardia (86 cases), Knemido-coptes (26 cases), coccidia (10 cases), Ascaridia (6 cases), Cryptosporidium (5 cases), Sarcocystis (5 cases), tapeworm (4 cases), microfilaria (2 cases), Hexamita (1 case), and Spiroptera (1 case). High incidences of giardiasis and knemido-coptic infestation were {{detected in the}} local birds, but rarely in the imported birds. Giardial trophozoites were observed mainly in the duodenum of budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus). Knemidocoptic mites burrowed into the epidermis producing proliferative dermatitis in 25 budgerigars and l African Grey Parrot (Psittacus erithacus erithacus). This ectoparasite often infested the skin around the cloaca. Coccidiosis was seen only in the small intestines of the finch (Poephila gouldiae gouldiae), African Grey Parrot, Rainbow lory (Trichoglossus haematodus), Indian Ring-necked parakeet (Psittacula krameri manillensis) and peach-faced lovebird (Agapornis roseicollis). Two parrots (Amazona aestiva aestiva and Psittacus erithacus erithacus) and two budgerigars had <b>intestinal</b> <b>cryptosporidiosis.</b> Conjunctivitis associated with cryptosporidial infection was seen in a lovebird.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} anti-cryptosporidial effects of, and {{concomitant}} amelioration of the histological {{changes in the}} gut of neonatal rats with <b>intestinal</b> <b>cryptosporidiosis</b> treated with the dinitroaniline, oryzalin. The ED 50 {{was determined to be}} 7 mg/kg using twice daily doses administered for 3 consecutive days. A maximum inhibition of 85. 5 % was achieved at 25 mg/kg and this inhibition remained constant despite increasing the oryzalin dose to 200 mg/kg. Cryptosporidiosis significantly decreased the intestinal villus/crypt (VC) ratio by approximately 50 % (duodenum = 2. 3, jejunum = 2. 5 and ileum = 1. 7) when compared to uninfected untreated controls (duodenum = 4. 3, jejunum = 5. 9 and ileum = 4. 5). Treatment with oryzalin doubled the VC ratio in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum following doses of 5 mg, 50 mg and 200 mg/kg respectively. Oryzalin concentrations in the small intestine contents and plasma were determined, using HPLC, at 0. 5, 1 and 2 h after dosing. The much greater dose required to return VC ratios to normal in the ileum (200 mg/kg) compared to the duodenum (6. 25 mg/kg) appeared to reflect the decreased concentration of the drug in the distal small intestine. Concentrations of oryzalin equivalent to the in vitro IC 50 were maintained for 2 h {{in the first half of}} the small intestine following a single dose of 100 mg/kg...|$|E
40|$|G duodenalis {{is one of}} {{the most}} common parasites found in {{ruminants}}. Most if not all ruminants become infected with G duodenalis at some point in their first few months of life. Giardiasis is chronic in ruminants, and, although it does not result in severe clinical signs, it does cause intestinal pathologic conditions that may result in malabsorption. Thus, giardiasis may be a production-limiting disease of ruminants. Studies employing molecular techniques demonstrate that the vast majority of ruminants are infected by a livestock-specific genotype of G duodenalis. Hence, although ruminants may serve as a potential reservoir for giardiasis in humans, they pose much less of a risk than was previously thought. C parvum remains an important cause of diarrhea in neonatal ruminants. Still, no treatment exists for cryptosporidiosis in North America. Recent research indicates that the parasite is much more common and important in dairy calves than in beef calves, and only young ruminants, generally less than 1 month of age, are infected with C parvum. Thus the zoonotic risk associated with C parvum infections in ruminants is limited to young animals and is easily managed. Less understood than <b>intestinal</b> <b>cryptosporidiosis,</b> abomasal cryptosporidiosis, caused by C andersoni, is an emerging disease in cattle that may have a significant impact on production in both beef and dairy cattle. In general, C andersoni infections are not common in cattle, but the prevalence can be high in some herds, and infections last months or even years. Further research is required if we are better to understand the significance of abomasal cryptosporidiosis...|$|E
40|$|An interpretive {{overview}} {{of the literature on}} <b>intestinal</b> <b>cryptosporidiosis</b> in humans and domestic mammals (Chapter 1) is followed by two studies of the population genetic structure of the protozoan parasites Cryptosporidium parvum and Cryptosporidium hominis (Chapter 2), five epidemiological studies of cryptosporidiosis in foals, calves and humans in New Zealand (Chapter 3), and an investigation of a serendipitous outbreak of cryptosporidiosis among a class of veterinary students, which occurred at the end of 2006 (Chapter 4). The analysis of the population genetic structure of C. parvum and C. hominis indicates the existence of a significant genetic segregation of geographically separated parasite populations, consistent with allopatry. The results do not conform to a simplistic model that considers all C. parvum as multi-host anthropozoonotic agents, and provide statistical support to the idea of the occurrence of anthroponotic cycles that do not involve cattle. Rather than conforming to a rigid paradigm of either a clonal or a panmictic species, data are consistent with the co-occurrence of clonal and recombinatorial diversification in C. hominis, and perhaps C. parvum. The results of the epidemiological studies in New Zealand suggest cryptosporidiosis caused by C. parvum is relatively common in young foals and calves. In the time and space frames underlying these studies, humans, calves, and foals were infected with a genetically homogeneous C. parvum population. This feature is in accordance with previous reports that have indicated C. parvum as the dominant species in humans during the peaks of incidence of cryptosporidiosis in winter and spring, and support the view that the peaks are in large part attributable to direct and/or indirect zoonotic transmission of C. parvum. Finally, the outbreak of cryptosporidiosis among a class of veterinary students highlighted the potential hazard for explosive large-scale outbreaks in New Zealand. The results of the investigation were consistent with point-source exposure and zoonotic transmission of a rare C. parvum subtype through direct contact with calves during a practicum...|$|E
