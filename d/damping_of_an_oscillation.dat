40|$|We study <b>damping</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dipole <b>oscillation</b> in <b>a</b> Bose-Condensed gas in a {{combined}} cigar-shaped harmonic trap and one-dimensional (1 D) optical lattice potential at finite temperatures. In order {{to include the}} effect of thermal excitations in the radial direction, we derive a quasi- 1 D model of the Gross-Pitaeavskii equation and the Bogoliubov equations. We use the Popov approximation to calculate the temperature dependence of the condensate fraction with varying lattice depth. We then calculate the Landau <b>damping</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dipole <b>oscillation</b> as <b>a</b> function <b>of</b> the lattice depth and temperature.

The magnitude <b>of</b> the <b>damping</b> rate is in reasonable agreement with experimental data. We also find that the damping rate has a strong temperature dependence, showing a sharp increase with increasing temperature. Finally, we emphasize the importance of the radial thermal excitations in both equilibrium properties and the Landau damping. Comment: 11 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of solute-solvent interactions on the vibrational energy relaxation dynamics of perylene and substituted perylenes {{in the first}} singlet excited-state upon excitation with moderate (< 0. 4 eV) excess energy has been investigated by monitoring the early narrowing of their fluorescence spectrum. This narrowing was found to occur on timescales ranging from <b>a</b> few hundreds <b>of</b> femtoseconds to <b>a</b> few picoseconds. Other processes, such as <b>a</b> partial decay <b>of</b> the fluorescence anisotropy and the <b>damping</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> low-frequency <b>oscillation</b> due to the propagation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> vibrational wavepacket, were found to take place on a very similar time scale. No significant relationship between the strength of nonspecific solute-solvent interactions and the vibrational energy relaxation dynamics of the solutes could be evidenced. On the other hand, in alcohols the spectral narrowing is faster with a solute having H-bonding sites, indicating that this specific interaction tends to favor vibrational energy relaxation. No relationship between the dynamics of spectral narrowing and macroscopic solvent properties, such as the thermal diffusivity, could be found. On the other hand, a correlation between this narrowing dynamics {{and the number of}} low-frequency modes of the solvent molecules was evidenced. All these observations cannot be discussed with a model where vibrational energy relaxation occurs via two consecutive and dynamically well-separated steps, namely ultrafast intramolecular vibrational redistribution followed by slower vibrational cooling. On the contrary, the results indicate that both intra-and intermolecular vibrational energy redistribution processes are closely entangled and occur, at least partially, on similar timescales...|$|R

This paper expands on the {{suggestion}} of De Moortel & Hood (2000) {{that it will be}} possible to infer coronal plasma properties by making <b>a</b> detailed study <b>of</b> the wavelet transform of observed oscillations. TRACE observations, taken on 14 July 1998, <b>of</b> <b>a</b> flare-excited, decaying coronal loop oscillation are used to illustrate the possible applications of wavelet analysis. It is found that a decay exponent n 2 gives the best t to the double logarithm of the wavelet power, thus suggesting an e−"t 2 damping prole for the observed oscillation. Additional examples of transversal loop oscillations, observed by TRACE on 25 October 1999 and 21 March 2001, are analysed and <b>a</b> <b>damping</b> prole <b>of</b> the form e−"t n, with n 0 : 5 and n 3 respectively, is suggested.

40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} loop simulation capability {{has been}} {{implemented in the}} thermal-hydraulic analysis code, THERMIT- 4 E. This code {{had been used to}} simulate and investigate flow in test sections of experimental sodium loops and of LMFBR fuel assemblies. Such analyses had required the use of boundary conditions specified at the inlet and outlet. The new code, THERMIT- 4 E/L simulates the entire primary coolant loop and therefore eliminates the need to specify such boundary conditions. The additions and modifications to the THERMIT- 4 E code include: constant temperature heat sinks, implicit heat transfer to environment and generalized body force field specification.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of the self-excitation of low frequency (100 - 600 Hz), longitudinal acoustic modes <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rearward-facing step combustor has been performed. As in combustion instabilities of air breathing propulsion systems, the pressure oscillations are excited by a fluctuating heat release from a flame that is stabilized in a recirculation zone. Flow visualization results and flame radiation intensity data reveal that large vortex structures are responsible for this fluctuating heat release. The vortices are shed at frequencies corresponding to longitudinal acoustic modes of the system or to the first subharmonic of one <b>of</b> the modes. <b>A</b> series <b>of</b> parametric studies were performed to determine the dependence of the vortex shedding frequency upon the step height, mean flow speed, fuel type, and equivalence ratio. It was discovered that the vortex shedding frequency can shift between modes as <b>a</b> result <b>of</b> changes in the chemical reaction time of the reactants or as <b>a</b> result <b>of</b> changes in the mixing process of the cold reactants with the hot products. Detailed investigations into the mechanism of sustenance of the oscillations during instability were performed for several operating conditions. The distribution of the combustion associated with vortex shedding was investigated by measuring the radiation intensity from the flame region. These results were used in Rayleigh's Criterion to determine regions <b>of</b> driving and <b>damping</b> <b>of</b> the <b>oscillations.</b> <b>A</b> one-dimensional linearized acoustic model is used to predict the natural modes {{of the system and}} a fluctuating volumetric source is used to model the oscillatory heat release. First, independent driving is applied to determine the system response to driving at different frequencies. One important result is that, the phase difference between the pressure oscillations and the velocity oscillations at the flameholder is very sensitive to the frequency of driving near natural modes of the system. Finally, a velocity-sensitive volumetric source with a time delay is included as feedback to determine the linear stability characteristics of the system. Various mechanisms leading to nonlinear limit cycle behavior are then discussed and compared to experimental data obtained during transition to instability...|$|R
40|$|The {{deregulation}} of the electricity market modifies considerably the technico-economic approach in the exploitation and the optimization of power systems. In this new context, power system specialists {{are more and more}} confronted with many challenges. Thus the power system operators are limited to serving the actual power demand by pushing the operating point closer to the generation and tie-line stability limits. Due to the weakness of these tie-Hnes, oscillations are often created between generating stations of different areas in the power system. This kind of oscillations is called "inter-area" oscillations; for <b>an</b> efficient <b>damping</b> <b>of</b> these <b>oscillations,</b> <b>a</b> supplementary <b>damping</b> loop can be set on Power System Stabilizers (PSS) or on reactive power injectors (FACTS devices). These controllers can have "distant input signaIs": signaIs coming from other area that the controller's one. These remûte input signaIs are synchronized via signaIs emitted by Global Positioning System satellites. In this work, the network analysis is yield with the small signal stability theory and the controllers are tuned using LMI (Linear Matrix Inequalities techniques). Perfonnances and robustness of these controllers are compared to controllers designed with other techniques (particularly with Residue and non-linear techniques). Moreover, because of {{deregulation of}} the electricity market, the increasing presence of controllers in power systems, and therefore their increasing closeness, may result in harmful interactions between the various controllers, called "control interactions", that can noticeably decrease overall system performance. An efficient and innovative strategy for control interaction mitigation is proposed.

40|$|Two {{alternatives}} {{have been}} suggested to explain the approximately exponential decrease in the light output of Type I supernovae. The Californium 254 hypothesis [Burbidge et al., 1957; Hoyle and Fowler, 1960] is that the exponential decay in light intensity {{is due to the}} nuclear energy released by the spontaneous fission of Cf 254; no efficient mechanism for converting fission energy into visible light was presented. A second hypothesis [Hoyle et al., 1964] is based on the <b>damping</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> assumed relativistic <b>oscillation</b> in gravitating masses. Theoretically it has not been possible to specify either radioactivity or gravitation as the sole energy source of the initial light output. The detector system described here will provide <b>a</b> means <b>of</b> experimentally verifying or refuting the Cf 254 hypothesis; however, this thesis will not resolve this controversy. Assuming the Cf-hypothesis to be valid and Type I supernovae to be the site of r-process nucleosynthesis, the gamma-ray line spectrum from radioactive decay of trans-bismuth nuclei can be calculated for any time in the history <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Type I supernovae. These calculations have been carried out for the Crab Nebula [Clayton and Craddock, 1965] and the resulting spectrum was used as the design criterion for the detector discussed here. This spectrum sets the requirement that the detector must be able to detect line fluxes of the order of 1 x 10 - 4 to 1 x 10 - 5 photons cm 2 sec- 1 above a background [Arnold et al., 1962; Metzger et al., 1964] given approximately by dN/dE = 1. 2 x 10 - 5 E 6 - 7 / 4 photons cm 2 sec- 1 kev- 1 sterad- 1, where E 6 is the photon energy in Mev. For photons in the energy range of 30 - 450 kev, a detector with <b>an</b> energy resolution <b>of</b> approximately 20 kev and <b>a</b> viewing angle <b>of</b> 0. 1 sterad or less will give an observable signal. A sodium iodide (thallium activated) scintillator four inches in diameter and two inches thick is used as the detector. The signal from this crystal from photons with energies between 30 and 455 kev is analyzed by a 128 channel pulse height analyzer. Collimation is obtained by <b>a</b> mixture <b>of</b> shielding and anticoincidence techniques. The detector is recessed eight inches into the end <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cylinder <b>of</b> NaI(T 1) nine and one half inches in diameter by twelve inches long. Additional collimation is provided by the use of three toroidal shaped plastic scintillators. The detector and the surrounding scintillators are optically decoupled and their signals are connected in anticoincidence. These scintillators reduce the effective half angle of the detector to one and one half to two degrees 3 x 10 - 3 sterad). A thin plastic scintillator is used to reject charged particles within this viewing angle. This instrument, along with its associated orientation system, is capable of observing the predicted gamma-ray spectrum from the Crab Nebula at altitudes of approximately 130, 000 feet.
