6000|$|Knyphausen did not settle Mecklenburg, as we perceive! Neither did Kannegiesser and the unliquidated Heritages prosper, at Hanover, quite to perfection. One Heritage, that of Uncle Osnabruck, little George flatly {{refused to}} share: FEUDUM {{the whole of}} that, not ALLODIUM any part of it, so that a Sister cannot claim. Which, I think, was {{confirmed}} by the Arbitrators at Brunswick; thereby ending that. Then as to the Ahlden ALLODIA or FEUDA,--Kannegiesser, blamably or not, never could make much of the business. A precise strict man, as we saw at the Hanover Council-room lately; whom the Hanover people did not like. So he made little of it. Nay at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>next</b> <b>year</b> (December, 1730), sending in his accounts to Berlin, he demands, {{in addition to the}} three thalers (or nine shillings) daily allowed him, almost a second nine shillings for sundries, chiefly for [...] "hair-powder and shoe-blacking"! And is instantly recalled; and vanishes from History at this point. [Busching, Beitrage, i. 307, &c.? Nussler.] ...|$|E
6000|$|For seven years, Albert {{held out}} in this {{intermediate}} state, neither peace nor war; moving Heaven and Earth to raise supplies, {{that he might be}} able to defy Poland, and begin war. The Reich answers, [...] "We have really nothing for you." [...] Teutschmeister answers again and again, [...] "I tell you we have nothing!" [...] In the end, Sigismund grew impatient; made (December, 1519) some movements of a hostile nature. Albert did not yield; eager only to procrastinate till he were ready. By superhuman efforts, of borrowing, bargaining, soliciting, and galloping to and fro, Albert did, about the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>next</b> <b>year,</b> get up some appearance of an Army: [...] "14,000 German mercenaries horse and foot," [...] so many in theory; who, to the extent of 8,000 in actual result, came marching towards him (October, 1520); to serve [...] "for eight months." [...] With these he will besiege Dantzig, besiege Thorn; will plunge, suddenly, like a fiery javelin, into the heart of Poland, and make Poland surrender its claim. Whereupon King Sigismund bestirred himself in earnest; came out with vast clouds of Polish chivalry; overset Albert's 8,000;--who took to eating the country, instead of fighting for it; being indeed in want of all things. One of the gladdest days Albert had yet seen, was when he got the 8,000 sent home again.|$|E

60|$|Red River flows on now to mix its long-pent-up waters with Lake Winnipeg. Boats {{are seen}} rowing about upon its waters, as the {{settlers}} travel {{from place to}} place; and wooden canoes, made of the hollowed-out trunks of large trees, shoot across from shore to shore--these canoes being a substitute for bridges, {{of which there are}} none, although the settlement lies {{on both sides of the}} river. Birds have now entered upon the scene, their wild cries and ceaseless flight adding to it a cheerful activity. Ground squirrels pop up out of their holes to bask their round, fat, beautifully-striped little bodies in the sun, or to gaze in admiration at the farmer, as he urges a pair of very slow-going oxen, that drag the plough at a pace which induces one to believe that the wide field may possibly be ploughed up by the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>next</b> <b>year.</b> Frogs whistle in the marshy ground so loudly that men new to the country believe they are being regaled by the songs of millions of birds. There is no mistake about their whistle. It is not merely like a whistle, but it is a whistle, shrill and continuous; and as the swamps swarm with these creatures, the song never ceases for a moment, although each individual frog creates only one little gush of music, composed of half a dozen trills, and then stops a moment for breath before commencing the second bar. Bull-frogs, too, though not so numerous, help to vary the sound by croaking vociferously, as if they understood the value of bass, and were glad of having an opportunity to join in the universal hum of life and joy which rises everywhere, from the river and the swamp, the forest and the prairie, to welcome back the spring.|$|E
