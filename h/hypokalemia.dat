5|$|Diets low in {{potassium}} {{can lead}} to hypertension and <b>hypokalemia.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Hypokalemia</b> (low blood {{potassium}} levels) commonly {{occurs during}} attacks; levels below 3.0mmol/l are typically encountered. Magnesium and phosphate levels are often {{found to be}} decreased. Creatine kinase levels are elevated in two thirds of cases, usually due to a degree of muscle injury; severe elevations suggestive of rhabdomyolysis (muscle tissue destruction) are rare. Electrocardiography (ECG/EKG) may show tachycardia (a fast heart rate) due to the thyroid disease, abnormalities due to cardiac arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia), and conduction changes associated with <b>hypokalemia</b> (U waves, QRS widening, QT prolongation, and T wave flattening). Electromyography shows changes similar to those encountered in myopathies (muscle diseases), with a reduced amplitude of the compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs); they resolve when treatment has commenced.|$|E
5|$|Potassium {{levels can}} {{fluctuate}} severely during {{the treatment of}} DKA, because insulin decreases potassium levels in the blood by redistributing it into cells via increased sodium-potassium pump activity. A {{large part of the}} shifted extracellular potassium would have been lost in urine because of osmotic diuresis. <b>Hypokalemia</b> (low blood potassium concentration) often follows treatment. This increases the risk of dangerous irregularities in the heart rate. Therefore, continuous observation of the heart rate is recommended, as well as repeated measurement of the potassium levels and addition of potassium to the intravenous fluids once levels fall below 5.3mmol/l. If potassium levels fall below 3.3mmol/l, insulin administration may need to be interrupted to allow correction of the <b>hypokalemia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Treatment of the <b>hypokalemia,</b> {{followed}} by correction of the hyperthyroidism, leads to complete {{resolution of the}} attacks. It occurs predominantly in males of Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Filipino, and Korean descent. TPP {{is one of several}} conditions that can cause periodic paralysis.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hypokalemia,</b> a {{deficiency}} of potassium in the plasma, {{can be fatal}} if severe. Common causes are increased gastrintestinal loss (vomiting, diarrhea), and increased renal loss (diuresis). Deficiency symptoms include muscle weakness, paralytic ileus, ECG abnormalities, decreased reflex response; and in severe cases, respiratory paralysis, alkalosis, and cardiac arrhythmia.|$|E
5|$|Thyrotoxic {{periodic}} paralysis (TPP) is {{a condition}} featuring attacks of muscle weakness {{in the presence of}} hyperthyroidism (overactivity of the thyroid gland). <b>Hypokalemia</b> (a decreased potassium level in the blood) is usually present during attacks. The condition may be life-threatening if weakness of the breathing muscles leads to respiratory failure, or if the low potassium levels lead to cardiac arrhythmias (irregularities in the heart rate). If untreated, it is typically recurrent in nature.|$|E
5|$|After several {{case reports}} in the 18th and 19th centuries, {{periodic}} paralysis was first described in full by the German neurologist Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal (1833–1890) in 1885. In 1926 the Japanese physician Tetsushiro Shinosaki, from Fukuoka, observed {{the high rate of}} thyroid disease in Japanese people with periodic paralysis. The first English-language report, in 1931, originated from Dunlap and Kepler, physicians at the Mayo Clinic; they described the condition in a patient with features of Graves' disease. In 1937 periodic paralysis was linked with <b>hypokalemia,</b> as well as precipitation of attacks with glucose and insulin. This phenomenon {{has been used as a}} diagnostic test.|$|E
5|$|The best-studied medical {{treatment}} for intracranial hypertension is acetazolamide (Diamox), which acts by inhibiting the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, and it reduces CSF production by six to 57 percent. It {{can cause the}} symptoms of <b>hypokalemia</b> (low blood potassium levels), which include muscle weakness and tingling in the fingers. Acetazolamide cannot be used in pregnancy, since {{it has been shown}} to cause embryonic abnormalities in animal studies. Also, in human beings it has been shown to cause metabolic acidosis as well as disruptions in the blood electrolyte levels of newborn babies. The diuretic furosemide is sometimes used for a treatment if acetazolamide is not tolerated, but this drug sometimes has little effect on the ICP.|$|E
5|$|The muscle {{weakness}} and {{increased risk of}} irregular heart beat in TPP result from markedly reduced levels of potassium in the bloodstream. Potassium is not in fact lost from the body, but increased Na+/K+-ATPase activity (the enzyme that moves potassium into cells and keeps sodium in the blood) leads to shift of potassium into tissues, and depletes the circulation. In other types of potassium derangement, the acid-base balance is usually disturbed, with metabolic alkalosis and metabolic acidosis often being present. In TPP, these disturbances are generally absent. <b>Hypokalemia</b> leads to hyperpolarization of muscle cells, making the neuromuscular junction less responsive to normal nerve impulses and leading to decreased contractility of the muscles.|$|E
5|$|Caesium {{compounds}} {{are rarely}} encountered by most people, but most caesium compounds are mildly toxic. Like rubidium, caesium tends to substitute potassium in the body, but is significantly larger {{and is therefore}} a poorer substitute. Excess caesium can lead to <b>hypokalemia,</b> arrythmia, and acute cardiac arrest, but such amounts would not ordinarily be encountered in natural sources. As such, caesium {{is not a major}} chemical environmental pollutant. The median lethal dose (LD50) value for caesium chloride in mice is 2.3g per kilogram, which is comparable to the LD50 values of potassium chloride and sodium chloride. Caesium chloride has been promoted as an alternative cancer therapy, but has been linked to the deaths of over 50 patients, on whom it was used as part of a scientifically unvalidated cancer treatment.|$|E
25|$|Furosemide may {{increase}} the risk of digoxin toxicity due to <b>hypokalemia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Electrolyte {{studies and}} renal {{function}} tests are done, as chronic diarrhea {{may be associated}} with <b>hypokalemia,</b> hypomagnesemia and pre-renal failure.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} a handful of {{published}} reports describing individuals with severe <b>hypokalemia</b> (low potassium levels) related to extreme consumption of colas.|$|E
25|$|Intravenous {{magnesium}} sulfate (MgSO4) {{can be given}} in response to cardiac arrhythmias to correct for <b>hypokalemia,</b> preventing pre-eclampsia, and has been suggested as having a potential use in asthma.|$|E
25|$|Nephrogenic DI {{results from}} lack of aquaporin {{channels}} in the distal collecting duct (decreased surface expression and transcription). It is seen in lithium toxicity, hypercalcemia, <b>hypokalemia,</b> or release of ureteral obstruction.|$|E
25|$|The tendency, as for all loop diuretics, {{to cause}} low serum {{potassium}} concentration (<b>hypokalemia)</b> {{has given rise}} to combination products, either with potassium itself (e.g. Lasix-K and Diumide-K Continus) or with the potassium-sparing diuretic amiloride (Co-amilofruse).|$|E
25|$|Two {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that Gatorade is at least as effective in treating dehydration as oral rehydration salts for adults or Pedialyte for {{children between the ages of}} 5 and 12. In both studies, however, potassium deficiency (<b>hypokalemia)</b> was more common in patients receiving Gatorade.|$|E
25|$|Common {{adverse effects}} of {{acetazolamide}} include the following: paraesthesia, fatigue, drowsiness, depression, decreased libido, bitter or metallic taste, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, black feces, polyuria, kidney stones, metabolic acidosis and electrolyte changes (<b>hypokalemia,</b> hyponatremia). Whereas less common adverse effects include Stevens–Johnson syndrome, anaphylaxis and blood dyscrasias.|$|E
25|$|In {{patients}} with grade I or II encephalopathy, enteral feeding should be initiated early. Parenteral nutrition {{should be used}} only if enteral feeding is contraindicated as it {{increases the risk of}} infection. Severe restriction of protein is not beneficial; 60 g/day of protein is generally reasonable. Fluid replacement with colloid (e.g. albumin) is preferred rather than crystalloid (e.g. saline); all solutions should contain dextrose to maintain euglycemia. Multiple electrolyte abnormalities are common in ALF. Correction of <b>hypokalemia</b> is essential as <b>hypokalemia</b> increases the kidneys' ammonia production, potentially exacerbating encephalopathy. Hypophosphatemia is especially common in {{patients with}} acetaminophen-induced ALF and in those with intact renal function. Hypoglycemia occurs in many patients with ALF and is often due to depletion of hepatic glycogen stores and impaired gluconeogenesis. Plasma glucose concentration should be monitored and hypertonic glucose administered as needed.|$|E
25|$|Though {{not stated}} as such within the package insert, {{ziprasidone}} is also {{considered to be}} contraindicated, as it may {{have the potential to}} prolong QT interval. Moxifloxacin should also be avoided in patients with uncorrected <b>hypokalemia,</b> or concurrent administration of other medications known to prolong the QT interval (antipsychotics and tricyclic antidepressants).|$|E
25|$|Primary aldosteronism, {{also known}} as primary hyperaldosteronism, is {{characterized}} by the overproduction of aldosterone by the adrenal glands, when not a result of excessive renin secretion. It leads to arterial hypertension (high blood pressure) associated with <b>hypokalemia,</b> usually a diagnostic clue. Secondary hyperaldosteronism, on the other hand, is due to overactivity of the renin-angiotensin system.|$|E
25|$|Gitelman-like diseases, {{which include}} the syndromes caused by genetic {{mutations}} in SLC12A3, CLNCKB, BSND, KCNJ10, FXYD2, HNF1B or PCBD1. In these diseases, the hypomagnesemia is accompanied by other defects in electrolyte handling such as hypocalciuria and <b>hypokalemia.</b> The genes involved in this group of diseases all encode proteins {{that are involved in}} reabsorbing electrolytes (including magnesium) in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney.|$|E
25|$|Extreme {{urination}} continues {{throughout the}} day and the night. In children, DI can interfere with appetite, eating, weight gain, and growth, as well. They may present with fever, vomiting, or diarrhea. Adults with untreated DI may remain healthy for decades as long as enough water is consumed to offset the urinary losses. However, there is a continuous risk of dehydration and loss of potassium that may lead to <b>hypokalemia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone is used {{primarily}} to treat heart failure, edematous {{conditions such as}} nephrotic syndrome or ascites in people with liver disease, essential hypertension, <b>hypokalemia,</b> secondary hyperaldosteronism (such as occurs with hepatic cirrhosis), and Conn's syndrome (primary hyperaldosteronism). On its own, spironolactone is only a weak diuretic because it primarily targets the distal nephron (collecting tubule), where only small amounts of sodium are reabsorbed, {{but it can be}} combined with other diuretics to increase efficacy.|$|E
25|$|Potassium is an electrolyte, 98% {{of which}} is intracellular. The 2% {{remaining}} outside the cell has great implications for cells that generate action potentials. Doctors prescribe potassium for patients when potassium levels are insufficient, called <b>hypokalemia,</b> in the blood. The potassium can be given orally, which is the safest route; {{or it can be}} given intravenously, in which case strict rules and hospital protocols govern the rate at which it is given.|$|E
25|$|Deficiency of {{magnesium}} can cause tiredness, generalized weakness, muscle cramps, abnormal heart rhythms, increased irritability {{of the nervous}} system with tremors, paresthesias, palpitations, <b>hypokalemia,</b> hypoparathyroidism which might result in hypocalcemia, chondrocalcinosis, spasticity and tetany, epileptic seizures, basal ganglia calcifications and in extreme and prolonged cases coma, intellectual disability or death. Other symptoms that have been suggested to be associated with hypomagnesemia are athetosis, jerking, nystagmus, and an extensor plantar reflex, confusion, disorientation, hallucinations, depression, hypertension and fast heart rate.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} side effects are fine tremor, anxiety, headache, muscle cramps, dry mouth, and palpitation. Other {{symptoms}} may include tachycardia, arrhythmia, flushing of the skin, myocardial ischemia (rare), and disturbances {{of sleep and}} behaviour. Rarely occurring, but of importance, are allergic reactions of paradoxical bronchospasms, urticaria (hives), angioedema, hypotension, and collapse. High doses or prolonged use may cause <b>hypokalemia,</b> which is of concern especially in patients with renal failure and those on certain diuretics and xanthine derivatives.|$|E
25|$|Licorice, {{which has}} {{indirect}} mineralocorticoid activity by inhibiting mineralocorticoid metabolism, {{has been found}} in studies to inhibit the antimineralocorticoid effects of spironolactone. Moreover, the addition of licorice to spironolactone has been found to reduce the antimineralocorticoid side effects of spironolactone in women treated with the drug for hyperandrogenism, and licorice may hence be used to reduce these side effects in women treated with spironolactone as an antiandrogen who are bothered by them. On {{the opposite end of the}} spectrum, spironolactone is clinically useful in reversing licorice-induced <b>hypokalemia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Caesium {{chloride}} has a {{low toxicity}} to human and animals. Its median lethal dose (LD50) in mice is 2300mg per kilogram of body weight for oral administration and 910mg/kg for intravenous injection. The mild toxicity of CsCl is related to its ability to lower the concentration of potassium {{in the body and}} partly substitute it in biochemical processes. When taken in large quantities, however, can cause a significant imbalance in potassium and lead to <b>hypokalemia,</b> arrythmia, and acute cardiac arrest. However, caesium chloride powder can irritate the mucous membranes and cause asthma.|$|E
25|$|Furosemide is {{injected}} either intramuscularly or intravenously, usually 0.5-1.0mg/kg twice/day, although less before a horse is raced. As with many diuretics, {{it can cause}} dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, including loss of potassium, calcium, sodium, and magnesium. Excessive use of furosemide will most likely lead to a metabolic alkalosis due to hypochloremia and <b>hypokalemia.</b> The drug should, therefore, {{not be used in}} horses that are dehydrated or experiencing kidney failure. It should be used with caution in horses with liver problems or electrolyte abnormalities. Overdose may lead to dehydration, change in drinking patterns and urination, seizures, gastrointestinal problems, kidney damage, lethargy, collapse, and coma.|$|E
25|$|The {{heart rate}} can be slowed by altered sodium and {{potassium}} levels, hypoxia, acidosis, alkalosis, and hypothermia. The relationship between electrolytes and HR is complex, but maintaining electrolyte balance {{is critical to}} the normal wave of depolarization. Of the two ions, potassium has the greater clinical significance. Initially, both hyponatremia (low sodium levels) and hypernatremia (high sodium levels) may lead to tachycardia. Severely high hypernatremia may lead to fibrillation, which may cause CO to cease. Severe hyponatremia leads to both bradycardia and other arrhythmias. <b>Hypokalemia</b> (low potassium levels) also leads to arrhythmias, whereas hyperkalemia (high potassium levels) causes the heart to become weak and flaccid, and ultimately to fail.|$|E
25|$|The {{adrenal cortex}} is {{hyperplastic}} and overstimulated, with no impairment of the mineralocorticoid pathway. Consequently, levels of DOC, corticosterone, and 18-deoxycorticosterone are elevated. Although these precursors of aldosterone are weaker mineralocorticoids, the extreme elevations usually provide enough volume expansion, blood pressure elevation, and potassium depletion to suppress renin and aldosterone production. Some persons with 17α-hydroxylase deficiency develop hypertension in infancy, and nearly 90% {{do so by}} late childhood. The low-renin hypertension is often accompanied by <b>hypokalemia</b> due to urinary potassium wasting and metabolic alkalosis. These features of mineralocorticoid excess are the major clinical clue distinguishing the more complete 17α-hydroxylase deficiency from the 17,20-lyase deficiency, which only affects the sex steroids. Treatment with glucocorticoid suppresses ACTH, returns mineralocorticoid production toward normal, and lowers blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|Since thiazide diuretics {{affect the}} {{transport}} of electrolytes and water in the kidney, they can be responsible for abnormalities of water balance and electrolyte levels. Removal of too much fluid can cause volume depletion and hypotension. Various electrolyte abnormalities may result, including hyponatremia (low sodium), <b>hypokalemia</b> (low potassium), hypochloremia (low chloride), hypomagnesemia (low magnesium), hypercalcemia (high calcium), and hyperuricemia (high uric acid). These may result in dizziness, headache, or heart arrhythmias (palpitations). Serious, though rare, side effects include aplastic anemia, pancreatitis, agranulocytosis, and angioedema. Metolazone, like other thiazide diuretics, may unmask latent diabetes mellitus or exacerbate gout, especially by interacting with medicines used to treat gout. In addition, thiazide diuretics, including metolazone, are sulfonamides; those with hypersensitivity to sulfonamides ("sulfa allergy") may also be allergic to metolazone.|$|E
500|$|The {{cause of}} Terri Schiavo's {{collapse}} {{was determined to}} be cardiac arrest. Her medical chart contained a note that [...] "she apparently has been trying to keep her weight down with dieting by herself, drinking liquids most of the time during the day and drinking about 10–15 glasses of iced tea." [...] Upon admission to the hospital, she was noted as suffering from <b>hypokalemia</b> (low potassium levels): her serum potassium level was an abnormally low 2.0mEq/L (the normal range for adults is 3.5–5.0mEq/L). Her sodium and calcium levels were normal. Electrolyte imbalance is often caused by drinking excessive fluids. A serious consequence of <b>hypokalemia</b> can be heart rhythm abnormalities, including sudden arrhythmia death syndrome. Terri was eventually switched from being fed by a nasogastric feeding tube to a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding tube.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "detoxification" [...] {{program was}} created by L. Ron Hubbard, who set out the {{procedure}} in Clear Body, Clear Mind, one of the canonical texts of Scientology. Known as the [...] "Purification rundown" [...] or [...] "Purif," [...] it is promoted through various groups affiliated with the Church of Scientology, including Narconon drug rehabilitation and the Second Chance Program. It claims to flush poisons from the body's fat stores using exercise, saunas, and high doses of vitamins, particularly niacin. Medical professionals have judged it to be unproven, ineffective and/or potentially dangerous. A report for the Department of Health in California described the mega-doses of vitamins as [...] "hazardous" [...] and [...] "in some cases lethal." [...] Scientology's own literature reports dehydration, electrolyte disturbances including hyponatremia (low sodium level) and <b>hypokalemia</b> (low potassium level), and heat-related illnesses as being frequent side-effects of the program. Testimonials from some participants credit it with improvements in physical and mental health, but several families blame the Rundown {{for the death of}} a relative.|$|E
