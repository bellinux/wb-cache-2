50|$|The {{introduction}} of new, more effective chemicals for pest control {{led to the}} expansion of Orkin's termite and <b>fumigation</b> <b>services,</b> in particular. Following the goals set by Felton, Orkin recognized the need to properly handle chemicals and was instrumental in emphasizing safety practices within the pest control industry, with Oser being named president of the NPCA in 1944 on a safety platform. Oser was also instrumental in forcing the shift in both industry and public attitudes that hiring a pest control service was not something to be ashamed of, but rather something that was a valuable service that protected the health and welfare of people and property.|$|E
40|$|The half-loss time (HLT) {{is used as}} an {{indicator}} to quantify gas leakage rates during methyl bromide (MB) and sulfuryl fluoride (SF) fumigations. Comparisons of HLTs between three MB and three SF fumigations were quantified in the Hal Ross pilot flour mill, Department of Grain Science and Industry, Kansas State University, USA. The sealing quality or gas tightness of the mill before each fumigation was verified by a pressurization test. Fumigant concentrations during the six fumigations were monitored continuously at 30 locations among the five mill floors during the 24 h fumigation period. A weather station on the mill roof monitored barometric pressure, wind speed and direction, temperature, and relative humidity. A data logger on each mill floor recorded temperature and relative humidity. The pressurization test showed {{that the relationship between}} airflow rate and building static pressure varied among the fumigations despite the same areas being sealed by two separate <b>fumigation</b> <b>service</b> providers due to environmental conditions not being identical among the fumigations. Concentrations of both fumigants within the mill ranged from 2 to 7 g/mÂ³. The observed HLTs for the MB and SF fumigations were in the range of 3. 61 to 28. 64 h and 9. 97 to 31. 65 h, respectively, and were inversely related only to wind speeds during fumigation and not any other environmental conditions recorded. In our study, the fumigant leakage rate was found to be predominantly a function of wind speed rather than inherent gas characteristics of MB and SF...|$|R
