50|$|This {{combination}} of features enables the rotor {{to respond to}} aerodynamic forces and tilt in any direction without introducing mechanical bending forces between the rotor and the rotor shaft. At {{the same time it}} is possible to control the rotor by tilting the rotor shaft (helicopter) in the desired direction of flight. The forward speed is however limited because the rotors have a high tendency to tilt up to counteract any horizontal movement. The rotors increased tilting tendency {{is an important part of}} achieving passive stability but it at the same time makes it almost impossible to use this rotor system in a helicopter flying in anything but calm weather. The Proxflyer rotor system is designed <b>for</b> <b>indoor</b> <b>use</b> <b>only</b> and it is claimed to be the rotor system that enables the most stable yet controllable indoor helicopters.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTraditional {{autonomous}} navigation {{systems for}} transportation use laser range scanners to con- struct 3 D driving scenes {{in terms of}} open and occupied voxels. Active laser range scanners suffer {{from a series of}} failures, such as inability to detect wet road surfaces, dark surfaces and objects at large distances. In contrast, passive video cameras are immune from these failures but processing is challenging. High dimensionality of the input image requires efficient Big Data analytic methods for the system to perform in real-time. In this paper we argue that object recognition is essential for a navigation system to generalize learned landmarks to new driving scenes, which is a requirement for practical driving. To overcome this difficulty we present an online learning neural network <b>for</b> <b>indoor</b> navigation <b>using</b> <b>only</b> stereo cameras. The network can learn a Finite Automaton (FA) for the driving problem. Transition of the FA depends on several information sources: sensory input (stereo camera images) and motor input (i. e. object, action, GPS, and attention). Our agent simulates the transition of the FA by developing internal representation using the Developmental Network (DN) without handcrafting states or transi- tion rules. Although the proposed network is meant <b>for</b> both <b>indoor</b> and outdoor navigation, it has been only tested in indoor environments in current work. Our experiments demonstrate the agent learned to recognize landmarks and the corresponding actions (e. g. follow the GPS input, correct current direction, and avoid obstacles). Our future work includes training and learning in outdoor driving scenarios...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally {{the type}} of robot used in the {{workplace}} consisted mainly o f the fixed arm variety. Any mobile robots that were commercially available required that the environment be altered to accommodate them. This involved the installation of guide lanes or some form of sensor units placed at various locations around the workplace to facilitate the robot in determining its position within the environment. Such approaches are costly and limit the use of robots to environments where these methods are feasible. The inadequacies in this technology has led to research into autonomous mobile robots that offer greater flexibility and do not require changes in the enviromnent. There are many technical issues {{to be addressed in}} designing such a robot. These stem from the necessity that the robot must be able to navigate through an environment unaided. Other problems such as the cost of the vehicle must be considered so that prospective customers will not be put off. This thesis discusses the strategies taken in addressing the problems associated with navigation in an obstacle strewn environment. Such issues include position estimation, path planning, obstacle avoidance and the acquisition and interpretation of sensor information. It also discusses the suitability of fuzzy logic for controlling a robot. A graphical user interface runs on the PC which communicates with the robot over a radio link. The robot uses a fuzzy logic controller to follow a planned path and avoid unknown obstacles by controlling the velocity and steering angle o f the drive unit. It is a tracked vehicle which is suitable <b>for</b> <b>indoor</b> <b>use</b> <b>only.</b> The results of path planning and the robots attempts at following the paths and avoiding obstacles are illustrated and discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{requirements}} on environmental and health compatibility of materials <b>for</b> <b>indoor</b> <b>use</b> have increased severely {{in the past}} years. Volatile organic compounds (VOC), together with very volatile (VVOC) and semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOC) {{are some of the}} most important impurities in indoor air.

The emissions and the odour behaviour of the materials are influenced by different factors, such as raw materials (fibres, polymers, additives, etc.), manufacturing conditions and ageing of the composite. The paper will introduce the most important testing methods with regard to emissions and odour of materials <b>for</b> <b>indoor</b> <b>use.</b> Furthermore the current situation regarding regulations <b>for</b> <b>indoor</b> products will be covered.
