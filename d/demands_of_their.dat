After being {{discovered}} by Gary Sanchez Productions, Wirkola pitched the idea at a meeting with Paramount Pictures and won a contract. Production began in March 2011 at the Babelsberg Studios in Germany and included extensive use of traditional special effects. In addition, Renner and Arterton had a month of training beforehand {{to prepare for the}} physical <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> roles. In terms of the weapons and wardrobe, Wirkola wanted an old-world look with a modern touch, and he was adamant about filming outdoors in European nature rather than in a studio. The project was filmed in Germany and featured an international cast and crew.|$|E

His work is at times complex, using multi-level layering and double voicing as narrative techniques for expressing viewpoint. The main characters of his books are primarily professional, middle-class white men—assistant district attorney Abner Coates in The Just and the Unjust, doctor George Bull in The Last Adam, Episcopal priest Ernest Cudlipp in Men and Brethren, U.S. Army Air Forces Colonel Norman Ross in Guard of Honor, and lawyer Arthur Winner in By Love Possessed, for example—- who confront issues such as duty and ethics in their careers {{while at the same}} time attempting to reconcile these with the emotional <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> personal lives, usually by compromising their principles. In almost every instance they are also archetypes of persons he observed in his own experience.|$|E

The standoff was broken by Kurt Laqueur (...) , the West German consul in Zagreb, who signed the refueling order without having been authorized to do so, thus allowing the Lufthansa jet to depart at 18:50, this time heading for Tripoli. At 21:03, it arrived at Tripoli International Airport, where the hostages were finally set free.|$|E

[...] The course was conducted off-campus at a military facility and, as Rejewski would discover in France in 1939, [...] "was entirely and literally based" [...] on French General Marcel Givièrge's 1925 book, Cours de cryptographie (Cryptography Course).

500|$|One of {{its first}} actions was to send {{petitions}} signed by thousands of textile workers to the Massachusetts General Court demanding a ten-hour work day. In response, the Massachusetts Legislature established a committee chaired by William Schouler, Representative from Lowell, to investigate and hold public hearings, during which workers testified about conditions in the factories and the physical <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> twelve-hour days. These were the first investigations into labor conditions by a governmental body in the United States. The 1845 Legislative Committee determined {{that it was not}} state legislature's responsibility to control the hours of work. The LFLRA called its chairman, William Schouler, a [...] "tool" [...] and worked to defeat him in his next campaign for the State Legislature. A complex election Schouler lost to another Whig candidate over the issue of railroads. The impact of working men [...] and working women [...] was very limited.

500|$|Parenting {{is a large}} task within itself, {{and when}} a parent has a career as well, it can cause a double burden, or work–family conflict. Strain begins to develop when women and men find that the <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> family are {{conflicting}} with the demands from their job. When one is faced with a double burden like this, it affects how decisions are made within a career and in a family; this burden could potentially effect when a couple decides to have children. 75% of all women who have jobs are in their childbearing prime. When the conflict between one's family and work presents itself, the unpaid work that is being done in the home may be cut down, because of the certain health effects, or {{as a solution to}} deal with the greater demands from the workplace. Social outings and visits, and family dinners are two of the first things that get cut back on due to the work/family conflict. In a study by Ari Väänänen, May V. Kevin, et al. found that if a man put a higher importance on their family, were more likely to stay home from work {{in order to deal with}} extreme family demands. Ways that the double burden can be lessened for is with hired help in the house, day-care facilities, and longer maternity leaves for women. For instance, in Norway women are allowed the options of 10months of maternity leave, where they will get 100% of their pay, or 12months leave, where they will only paid 80% of their earnings. Some companies are realizing the effect the double burden of work and a family is having on their employees and are offering flexible work schedules in order to help their employees cope. Not only do these flexible hours help the employee deal with their stress, but it also benefits the company because workers are happier, less likely to be absent, more productive, and the turnover rate is lower for the company. As Sophia Mwangi says, [...] "Parenthood is a joy. Let us never be burdened by it but let's celebrate the joy that it brings. Celebrate those first steps or words, the first school play, their graduation day, passing those exams, landing their first job, getting married, making you grandparents. Whatever it is, let's celebrate our children. It's not easy, but the art of juggling can always be mastered!" ...|$|E

These strains can relate to health related issues, lower productivity, and other work problems.

2500|$|Scharnhorst {{describes}} {{six major}} themes in Alger's boys' books. The first, the Rise to Respectability, he observes, {{is evident in}} both his early and his late books, notably Ragged Dick, whose impoverished young hero declares, [...] "I mean to turn over a new leaf, and try to grow up 'spectable." [...] His virtuous life wins him not riches but, more realistically, a comfortable clerical position and salary. The second major theme is Character Strengthened Through Adversity. In Strong and Steady and Shifting for Himself, for example, the affluent heroes are reduced to poverty and forced to meet the <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> new circumstances. Alger occasionally cited the young Abe Lincoln {{as a representative of}} this theme for his readers. The third theme is Beauty versus Money, which became central to Alger's adult fiction. Characters fall in love and marry {{on the basis of their}} character, talents, or intellect rather than the size of their bank accounts. In The Train Boy, for example, a wealthy heiress chooses to marry a talented but struggling artist, and in The Erie Train Boy a poor woman wins her true love despite the machinations of a rich, depraved suitor. Other major themes include the Old World versus the New.|$|E
