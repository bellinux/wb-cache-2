Seventeen semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} Dutch key stakeholders working in the practical and scientific field of carrier screening.

On a structural level barriers included: need for organisational structures in healthcare for embedding carrier screening, need for guidelines, financial structures, practical tools for overcoming challenges during counselling, and a need for training and education of both professionals and the public.

Hebron Master of Public Health in Health Education 	 Hereditary {{inclusion body}} myopathy (HIBM) or {{as it is}} officially known, GNE myopathy, is a neuromuscular pan-ethnic genetic disorder that disproportionately affects the Iranian Jewish population worldwide. HIBM {{is one of the}} most severe Iranian Jewish genetic diseases, as it causes the onset of muscular deterioration in the prime of one???s life: in the second to third decade of life. The progressive weakening of muscles leads to debilitation so severe that it often forces patients into a wheelchair within 10 years of disease onset. Currently, there is no approved cure or treatment for HIBM. Approximately 1 in 1, 000 Iranian Jews are homozygous for the disease causing mutation, however carrier rates for the mutation is estimated to be about 1 in 15 in this population. Contrary to the formidable Tay-Sachs intervention efforts in the Ashkenazi Jewish population initiated in the 1970 ???s, prior population-based carrier screenings for HIBM in the Iranian Jewish population have been unsuccessful in ameliorating screening conviction. Therefore, this study explored the factors that influence intention to undergo preconception <b>genetic</b> <b>carrier</b> screening for hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM) within the Iranian Jewish adult population. This study utilized a theoretical hybrid of the Health Belief Model and the Theory of Planned behavior to explore whether knowledge of HIBM, attitudes toward carrier screening, perceptions of benefits, barriers, susceptibility, severity, and lastly gender will predict the intention to screen; an important genetic disease prevention behavior. An online survey was self-developed and administered to 71 (N= 71) Iranian Jewish adults aged 18 and 40 years old through organizational recruitment. The instrument was measured for internal consistency through a two-week test/re-test method. Logistic regression was used to assess these predictive associations. Findings suggest that knowledge of HIBM is extremely low in this sample, with a mean score of 37 % on the knowledge subscale. Regression analysis revealed that perceived severity, perceived physical barriers, perceived benefits and perceived psychological barriers were most significant in explaining the participants??? intention to undergo <b>genetic</b> <b>carrier</b> screening. Collectively, the model explained 42. 2 % of the variance in the dependent variable. These preliminary findings have implications for public health practitioners, health care providers and genetic counselors. In addition, the findings show the importance of informing those at risk by tailored health education initiatives...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Genetic {{technologies}} advance rapidly. It {{is possible}} to undergo <b>genetic</b> <b>carrier</b> screening before pregnancy to examine genetic risks to future offspring. We aimed to investigate parents’ interest and motives towards preconception <b>genetic</b> <b>carrier</b> screening (PCS) as well as factors associated with interest in PCS. Material and methods: Our study sample consists of 777 parent couples within the longitudinal Swedish Pregnancy Planning study. Women responded to questionnaires at three occasions: in early pregnancy, late pregnancy, and one year after childbirth. Male partners responded to one questionnaire one year after childbirth. Results: One-third of the parents were positive (30 % versus 34 % of women and men, respectively), {{less than a third}} were negative (26 % versus 28 %), and 45 % versus 38 % were uncertain about whether to consider PCS before a future pregnancy. No differences in PCS interest were found between women and men (P =  0. 091), but a higher proportion of women were concerned about negative consequences (53 % versus 46 %, P <  0. 003) and were ‘opposed to such a way of child selection’ (31. 8 % versus 25. 2 %,P =  0. 002). Factors associated with PCS interest were experiences of prenatal diagnostics and positive attitudes towards finding out or choosing sex of one’s child (women), and prenatal diagnostics, self-rated poor health, and pregnancy planning (men). Conclusion: Both women and men had relatively high uncertainty towards PCS, but women were more concerned about negative consequences. The future extent of the clinical utility of PCS is currently unknown, but parents’ interests and doubts are important aspects to consider...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to asses the Persian-American Jewish community’s perceptions of the risk of genetic disorders and their attitudes toward testing and to determine whether disinterest in carrier screening is due to lack of education and resources about the disorders or due to fear of disapproval from the community. By forming a better understanding of this population, community based screening programs can be implemented to serve this at-risk population. A short anonymous survey was distributed online. In total, 202 individuals responded to the survey. The risk for genetic disorders was generally underestimated within the study population, with a low level of knowledge pertaining to disorders more prevalent in their community. Attitudes toward genetic testing and screening were positive, with individuals of higher education levels scoring higher. The majority of participants were willing to undergo <b>genetic</b> <b>carrier</b> screening and testing, regardless of their demographic background. Levels of genetic knowledge did not impact participants’ willingness to undergo genetic testing. There was a higher association of stigma with respect to carrier status and ability to find a marriage partner, with individuals aged 45 and older less likely to approve of a marriage between an unaffected carrier and their family member. The majority of individuals preferred genetic education from their doctor or through a community program. The results of this study demonstrate the need for educational programs to target the Persian Jewish community and the establishment of screening programs to address the population’s willingness to undergo <b>genetic</b> <b>carrier</b> screening and testing...|$|E

In nearly 50 % of cases the pathology is inherited, and more than 60 genes have been reported as disease-causing. However, in 30 % of familial cases the mutation remains unidentified even after comprehensive genetic analysis. This study clinically and genetically assessed a large Spanish family affected by dilated cardiomyopathy to search for novel variations. Methods and Results Our study included a total of 100 family members. Clinical assessment was performed in alive, and genetic analysis was also performed in alive and 1 deceased relative. Genetic screening included resequencing of 55 genes associated with sudden cardiac death, and Sanger sequencing of main disease-associated genes. Genetic analysis identified a frameshift variation in BAG 3 (p. H 243 Tfr* 64) in 32 patients. Genotype-phenotype correlation identified substantial heterogeneity in disease expression. Of 32 <b>genetic</b> <b>carriers</b> (one deceased), 21 relatives were clinically affected, and 10 were asymptomatic.
