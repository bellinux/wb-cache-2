5|$|About {{a talent}} for composition... I can say nothing as yet. You have tried your powers too little... Yes, one can study on one's own. Sometimes one needs advice, but one must study... All of us, that is, I myself and Borodin, and Balakirev, and {{especially}} Cui and Mussorgsky, did disdain these things. I consider myself lucky that I bethought myself in time and <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> to work. As for Balakirev, owing to his insufficient technique he writes little; Borodin, with difficulty; Cui, carelessly; and Mussorgsky, sloppily and often incoherently.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{kind of had}} to hit rock bottom. I didn't have a band. I didn't have a studio. I {{had this}} {{platinum}} record that {{showed up in the}} mail, and I had nothing except for my own talents. So at some point, I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> to play the guitar. I would force myself to write lyrics. I was playing people's demos. I was still into the band. It's just that I didn't have anything.|$|E
2500|$|... "After a night {{spent in}} fever and sleeplessness, I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> {{to take a}} long tramp the next day through the hilly country, which was covered with pine woods. It all looked dreary and desolate, and I could not think what I should do there. Returning in the afternoon, I {{stretched}} myself, dead tired, on a hard couch, awaiting the long-desired hour of sleep. It did not come; but I fell into a kind of somnolent state, in which I suddenly felt as though I were sinking in swiftly flowing water. The rushing sound formed itself in my brain into a musical sound, the chord of E flat; major, which continually re-echoed in broken forms; these broken chords seemed to be melodic passages of increasing motion, yet the pure triad of E flat; major never changed, but seemed by its continuance to impart infinite significance to the element in which I was sinking. I awoke in sudden terror from my doze, feeling as though the waves were rushing high above my head. I at once recognised that the orchestral overture to the Rheingold, which must long have lain latent within me, though it had been unable to find definite form, had at last been revealed to me." [...] (.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You are right. I repress <b>myself</b> and <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> to act a part. It {{is not in}} tameness {{of spirit}} that I submit. I have a settled purpose.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You must {{forgive me}} for <b>forcing</b> <b>myself</b> upon you to-day,' he said slowly. 'But my time is very short, and I wanted {{to speak to you}} at once.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Teddy Bear, {{you know}} I couldn't. But I could run away, I could hide from you, I could lock <b>myself</b> up and <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> {{not to come}} to you." ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> {{to mention}} Van Brandt's name, rather than hear it pass her lips.|$|E
60|$|A queer world! thought I even then--to you now it {{must seem}} impossibly queer,--and after an {{interval}} I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> {{back to my}} own affair.|$|E
60|$|From that moment, {{whenever}} I {{felt as if}} it {{was impossible}} to take another step, I looked at Darius, and <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> to forget weariness or hunger.|$|E
60|$|While he {{uttered the}} last words, I felt my self-possession returning. I could not <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> to speak, as I would fain have spoken--I could only move away, to leave him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'We'll go together,' {{repeated}} Lagnier. 'You {{shall see}} how soon I will <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> to be recognised as a gentleman, and you shall profit by it. It is agreed? Are we one?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is most preposterous in me thus to <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> upon you, {{and then}} trouble {{you with my}} cares. But I had been alone so long, and I was so weary of it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I don’t {{think she}} has done badly for herself, so far,” I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> to say. “I suppose you know that she began life by herding the village goats.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{different}} then," [...] he explained. [...] "I was scared--badly scared--but I felt I {{could do the}} thing if I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> to it. Now I'm almost certain that I can't." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Secretary as {{suddenly}} brightened, and returned: 'Upon my honour I had no thought but for you. I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> to be constrained, lest you might misinterpret my being more natural. There. It's gone.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Amal. Assist me, Venus, for I tremble when I am to speak, but I must <b>force</b> <b>myself.</b> [...] [Aside. Sir, I would crave but {{one short}} minute with you, And some few words.|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{wonder if}} that has any special significance,” he said. “I will not <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> upon the man, but it’s quite evident I can’t afford to stand off if he means to be friendly.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "After all, it's not my fault. I can't <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> to believe. If {{there is}} a God after all and he punishes me because I {{honestly}} don't believe in Him I can't help it." ...|$|R
60|$|So far I had <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> {{to listen}} to him. At those last words {{the picture of the}} future that he was placing before me became too hideous to be endured. I refused to hear more.|$|E
60|$|When my lips had parted, and had shaped {{some words}} that were without sound, I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> to tell him (though I could not do it distinctly), that I had been chosen to succeed to some property.|$|E
6000|$|... "What have I done?" [...] {{he asked}} fiercely. [...] "What have I failed to do? Why {{do you look}} as though I had <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> upon you? Haven't I the right? Don't you wish to see me?" ...|$|E
5000|$|On my honor, {{and with}} the grace of God I <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> to serve {{as best you can}} my church, my country, to help my {{neighbor}} in all circumstances and to fulfill the Law Scout ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Craving your pardon, madam, I have {{no wish to}} <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> on her {{presence}} thus early," [...] said. Douglas, in an indifferent tone; [...] "it might displease her, and were no way agreeable to me." ...|$|R
5000|$|... ("On my honor, {{and with}} the grace of God, I <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> to serve with the best that I can do, to my church and my homeland, to help my fellow man/woman in any circumstance, and to uphold the Scout Law.") ...|$|R
60|$|My voice faltered {{a little}} in spite of me. I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> from the room. It was no time, then, for parting with the {{self-control}} which might yet serve me in my need before the day was out.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{promise that}} you will never tell James that he owes {{anything}} to me. I couldn't bear him to think I had <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> on him so as to {{have a sort of}} claim. Please promise me that." ...|$|E
60|$|Then I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> to {{take part}} in conversation, {{speaking}} of this or that trouble or adventure in the past; but never once of what might be before us in the future, and thus the time passed until we believed we were warranted in setting forth.|$|E
5000|$|Tang Yin {{also wrote}} A Short Verse on Bamboo:"The moon sinks {{in the fourth}} watch,Paper windows seem transparent;Stirring from wine,I prop my head and read awhile.High thoughts, I <b>force</b> <b>myself,</b> but can't help it;Ten stalks, still green in winter, cast profuse shadows." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I'm a coward--a {{natural born}} coward--and I {{can have a}} lot of fun <b>forcing</b> <b>myself</b> to face the shell and shrapnel. That's the truth; I'm not a liar. And for a long time I've been wondering--wondering--" [...] His voice died away in a murmur.|$|R
6000|$|... "The young lady," [...] said I, <b>forcing</b> <b>myself</b> {{to assume}} {{an air of}} pleasantry, which, I believe, became me {{extremely}} ill, [...] "would perhaps have been inclined {{to look a little}} lower on the family-tree, for the branch to which she was desirous of clinging." ...|$|R
60|$|This much Jacob {{must have}} {{understood}} {{as well as}} I, for when I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> backward, pushing vigorously against him, he gave way, and we thus slowly retreated until having gained such {{a distance from the}} feasting murderers that it seemed safe to rise to our feet.|$|E
60|$|My little pupil {{was away}} for the day--gone {{to play with the}} clergyman's {{children}} down in the village, and my time was my own. I was thankful, for I could not possibly have <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> into the wearisome routine of lesson hearing and teaching. Solitude was my only relief.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Bess, {{the fact}} is I've been dreaming a lot. This valley makes a fellow dream. So I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> to think. We can't live this way much longer. Soon I'll simply {{have to go to}} Cottonwoods. We need a whole pack train of supplies. I can get--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I can't <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> upon you," [...] Dominey said {{a little}} wistfully. [...] "It seems strange, though, to meet right out here, far away even from the by-ways of life, just to shake hands and pass on. I am sick to death of niggers and animals." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing in the world," [...] said I, <b>forcing</b> <b>myself</b> upon confession, as {{the best}} way of {{clearing}} myself out of the scrape,--"only--only I sent you a little parcel, and as you are so regular in acknowledging letters and communications, I--I thought it might have miscarried--that's all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... (Village of Treen, October 22nd.)--The {{events of}} this one day have changed the whole future of my life. I must <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> to write of them at once. Something warns me that if I delay, though only till to-morrow, I shall be {{incapable}} of relating them at all.|$|R
