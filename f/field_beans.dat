40|$|Intercropping (IC) cereals and legumes {{could be}} an option for obtaining forage {{suitable}} for ensiling and enabling reduced N fertilization. Two experiments were performed in central Italy with durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) and <b>field</b> <b>bean</b> (Vicia faba L. var. minor) grown for forage production in IC and as sole crops (SC) with different N rates (20 and 50 kg ha− 1) and row ratios (1 : 1 and 2 : 1 cereal/legume). The aims were to assess (i) whether IC is a feasible option to reduce N fertilization; (ii) the best combination of practices to obtain forage suitable for ensiling; and (iii) competition/facilitation effects exerted by <b>field</b> <b>bean</b> on durum wheat. Results showed IC allowed fertilizer-N reduction and led to improved forage yield with better quality, compared with SC. Land equivalent ratio indicated a high efficiency of the IC, by up to 26 % with respect to SC. <b>Field</b> <b>bean</b> was the dominant species of IC, but N fertilization reduced its competitive ability and enhanced that of wheat.

40|$|Field {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} <b>field</b> <b>bean</b> in the north-eastern part of the Republic of Croatia to compare weed control and crop response under different management practices within the critical period of <b>field</b> <b>bean</b> production. The practices consisted in broadcast application of labelled rate of preemergence herbicide (PRE) and postemergence herbicide application: (POST) broadcast, band application over the rows, and band application combined with mechanical cultivation using of different herbicide doses recommended by the manufacturer (2 x, 1 x, 1 / 2 x, 1 / 4 x, 1 / 8 x). In 1999, weed control with PRE application of pendimethalin was superior to POST bentazone application due to late emergence of weeds and lack of residual herbicide control. In 2000 bentazone combined with cycloxydim controlled weeds in <b>field</b> <b>bean</b> better than PRE herbicide application.

40|$|Batch {{testing of}} biomethanization was {{conducted}} on organic matrices from a mixture of grasses (triticale and barley) and legumes (<b>field</b> <b>bean</b> - Vicia faba L. var. minor). These tests were performed in mesophylic conditions (35 °C) on previously chopped and ensiled biomass. The three crops have been cultivated in Southern Italy (Puglia region), both as single-crops and intercropping between triticale or barley and <b>field</b> <b>bean,</b> in different mixture combinations, during the season 2009 - 2010. Emphasis {{was placed on the}} determination of the chemical composition of feedstock from the three single species and their different intercropping ratios, mowed at two subsequent stages (milk and dough development of grasses), also assessing their consequent biogas and methane potential yields after silage. Seven overall treatments have been compared: the three species in monoculture (triticale, barley and <b>field</b> <b>bean,</b> respectively); two mixtures between triticale and <b>field</b> <b>bean</b> (with triticale at 70 and 50 %, respectively); two mixtures between barley and <b>field</b> <b>bean</b> (again with barley at 70 and 50 %, respectively). Immediately after cutting and for the next 90 days, biomass samples were closed into plastic mini-silos, each having a 5 -L capacity, in order to simulate the silage process. Thereafter, the batch testing was performed and biogas and methane production have been determined, with respect to the main chemical characteristics of the chopped and ensiled biomass samples, able to affect biogas and methane yield. Considering the single-crop treatments the highest biogas per hectare production has been found with respect to triticale (8737. 1 nm 3 ha - 1) and barley (8837. 6 nm 3 ha - 1), at the first and second harvesting stage, respectively. Concerning grass-legume intercropping, the highest biogas yield (8635. 0 nm 3 ha - 1) was observed with reference to the 70 : 30 mixing ratio, specifically on barley mowed at the milk development stage. The methane content in the biogas ranged from 61. 1 % (on a 50 : 50 mixing ratio of barley at the milk stage) to 53. 7 % (on a barley monoculture at the dough stage) ...|$|R

40|$|Thirty-two Appenninica lambs were {{submitted}} to a growth trial from day 60 to day 110 of age (on average) and the com-   position of gains was estimated {{by means of the}} comparative slaughter technique. Sixteen different diets, based on wheat   straw as the forage and on <b>field</b> <b>bean</b> (Vicia faba var. minor) as the sole protein feed, were tested both by means of ANOVA   and of response surface analysis, a multiple regression method designed to study additive and interaction effects. This   study thus examined the combined effect of 4 levels of dietary CP (13, 15, 18, 20 % DM) and 4 levels of rumen protected   lysine and methionine, replacing 4 levels of <b>field</b> <b>bean</b> CP (0, 1, 2, 3 percent units), upon intakes, gains, digestibility and   retentions of nutrients within gains.

The lectins were bio-assayed against the neonate larvae of H. armigera by treating {{the surface of the}} artificial diet. The differences in larval weights among the diets with different lectins were not significant. The weight of the pupae reared on a diet containing garlic lectin II (from transgenic tobacco) was significantly lower (283. 81 mg per larva) than that of the untreated control diet (325. 00 mg per larva). The pupal period of the insects reared on diets containing lectins from <b>field</b> <b>bean,</b> pigeon pea, chickpea and garlic was significantly shorter than that reared on the untreated control diet.
