40|$|During {{a loss of}} coolant {{accident}} in nuclear reactors, radiation heat transfer accounts for a significant amount of the total heat transfer in the fuel bundle. In case of heavy water moderator nuclear reactors, the decay heat of a fuel bundle enclosed in the pressure tube and outer concentric calandria tube can be transferred to the moderator. Radiation heat transfer plays a significant role in removal of decay heat from the fuel rods to the moderator, which is available outside the calandria tube. A single <b>heater</b> <b>rod</b> test facility is designed and fabricated as a part of preliminary investigations. The objective is to anticipate the capability of moderator to remove decay heat, from the reactor core, generated after shut down. The present paper focuses mainly on the role of moderator in removal of decay heat, for situation with air alone in the annular gap of pressure tube and calandria tube. It is seen that the naturally aspirated air is capable of removing the heat generated in the system compared to the standstill air or stagnant water situations. It is also seen that the flowing moderator is capable of removing a greater fraction of heat generated by the <b>heater</b> <b>rod</b> compared to a stagnant pool of boiling moderator...|$|E
40|$|In the {{development}} of supercritical pressure water cooled reactors, {{it is important to}} understand the characteristics of a heat transfer near the thermodynamic critical point. An experimental study on a critical heat flux near the critical pressure has been performed with a 5 x 5 square array <b>heater</b> <b>rod</b> bundle cooled by R- 134 a fluid. The critical power has been accurately measured up to a reduced pressure of 0. 99 (4. 03 MPa). The critical power decreases sharply at a pressure of about 3. 8 − 3. 9 MPa as the pressure approaches the critical pressure. The CHF phenomenon near the critical pressure no longer leads to an inordinate increase in the heated wall temperature such as in the case of DNB at normal pressure conditions. In the pressure region close to the critical pressure, there is a threshold pressure at which the CHF phenomenon disappears. When the pressure exceeds this threshold pressure, the wall temperature increases monotonously without a CHF occurrence according to the power level applied to the heater rods. The effect of the unheated rods in the <b>heater</b> <b>rod</b> bundle on the critical power becomes smaller as the pressure approaches the critical pressure. The turbulence effect by the mixing vane of the spacer grid on the critical power is maintained up to a pressure of 3. 95 MPa...|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} work, {{numerical}} simulations and experiments of an 8 × 8 square array of <b>heater</b> <b>rods</b> within an aluminum enclosure have been performed. This geometry represents the region inside the channel of a {{boiling water reactor}} (BWR) fuel assembly between two consecutive spacer plates. The simulation model and the experimental apparatus can be oriented horizontally or vertically, to represent transport or storage configurations. The interior void is filled with air at ambient pressure conditions. All rods dissipate at the same heating rate. In the experiment, this is controlled using a variable power supply. The temperatures are measured in the experiment by thermocouples that are placed within the enclosure walls, on the endplates, and in 31 of the 64 <b>heater</b> <b>rods</b> at their axial mid-planes. The three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model {{is based on the}} dimensions of experimental apparatus. Natural convection/radiation simulations are performed using the Fluent package at the same average wall temperatures and rates of heat generation measured from the experiment. Simulation results of rod temperatures are compared to experimental results to assess the accuracy of the three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations.

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Muitiregion annular {{geometry}} {{is a basic}} {{feature of}} energy removal systems ranging from advanced heat exchangers to fission reactor fuel rods. For the symmetric cases, the heat conduction through annular regions is well defined. However, for a shift of an annular region, analysis of the system must be made in two dimensions. The {{purpose of this study}} is to characterize the steady state heat conduction through eccentric annuli through a theoretical, numerical, and experimental investigation. In the theoretical study, the analytical solutions are sought for the governing heat conduction equations. Separate polar coordinate systems are used to describe the points in the inner tube, the annular region, and the outer tube. Particular attention is given to the interface conditions by explicitly retaining continuity of the components of the heat flux vector. Within the context of the specified assumptions, the resulting solutions are general, valid for any size annular regions and any degree of eccentricity. The boundary condition on the outer tube surface can be specified by either a prescribed temperature function of angle or a convective boundary condition. A computer program is developed to perform the calculations of the two-dimensional temperature profiles within the eccentric system. This program can be verified mathematically for the concentric condition. The experimental study is designed to verify the program for eccentric situations. The experiment is a straightforward determination of the two-dimensional temperature field within the eccentric annuli. An electrical <b>heater</b> <b>rod</b> is used in the experiment. A PVC pipe is chosen as the outer tube. For the intermediate annular region, standard hard lead shot is utilized. The thermal conductivity of the packed bed of lead shot is relatively insensitive over the temperature range of interest, and the thermal conductivity of the PVC pipe is constant over the temperature range used. The study of the results between the analytical solutions and the measurements indicate that the temperature profiles within the system can be accurately predicted if an appropriate boundary condition is used. In addition to the theoretical and experimental phases, numerical aspects of the problem are also studied. Four general approaches have been used to treat the problem. The first is to approximate the <b>heater</b> <b>rod</b> surface by a ratchet. This results in an increase in the number of radial node regions required and a subsequent loss of economy. The second approach utilizes concentric regions and defines a variable conductivity within the annulus region to account for the eccentric condition. This reduces the number of radial node regions and results in saving in both computation time and core space. To eliminate the common limitation in both approaches that the eccentric displacement must be smaller than the radius of <b>heater</b> <b>rod,</b> a third approach is developed. This approach utilizes a two-dimensional, cylindrical model in which the origin of the coordinate system is located at the center of the <b>heater</b> <b>rod.</b> However, if an existing general purpose finite difference code is used, an additional effort is required to translate the temperature profiles to a new coordinate system with the origin located at the center of outer tube. An existing finite element computer code is utilized as the fourth numerical approach. A relatively coarser grid system can be used in this code and less computer running time is required...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Currently {{there is}} a great amount of {{interest}} in the phenomena of natural circulation as a cooling mechanism for normal operation as well as emergency conditions in nuclear reactors and spent fuel pools. In order to better understand this phenomena for the specific geometry of vertical, heated rods in water, an experimental facility was designed and constructed at Oregon State University. This facility, named the Laser-Imaged Natural Circulation (LINC) facility, consists of a water tank capped with a custom cooling plate through which two heated rods pass into the tank. The LINC facility enables flow patterns in the channel between the heated rods to be imaged and quantified using particle image velocimetry (PIV). This paper presents the reasoning and theory behind the design of the LINC facility, as well as a characterization of the thermodynamics, boundary layer thickness and velocity profile progression of the system. The thermodynamic analysis consists of bulk equilibrium temperatures and heat removal rates for 3 cases where the two <b>heater</b> <b>rods</b> have equal power levels (dubbed "symmetrical heating"). The boundary layer thickness analysis consists of a test matrix of 5 test cases including symmetrical and asymmetrical heating in which the thickness of the boundary layer is measured using the velocity field between the <b>heater</b> <b>rods.</b> The velocity profile analysis centered on an effective vertical length of 100 mm along the entrance region between the two rods at one symmetrical rod power.

40|$|Thermal {{stratification}} is {{encountered in}} large {{pool of water}} increasingly being used as heat sink in new generation of advanced reactors. These large pools at near atmospheric pressure provide a heat sink for heat removal from the reactor or steam generator, and the containment by natural circulation {{as well as a}} source of water for core cooling. For examples, the PAFS (passive auxiliary feedwater system) is one of the advanced safety features adopted in the APR+(Advanced Power Reactor Plus), which is intended to completely replace the conventional active auxiliary feedwater system [1, 2]. The PAFS cools down the steam generator secondary side and eventually removes the decay heat from the reactor core by adopting a natural convection mechanism. In a pool, the heat transfer from the PCHX (passive condensation heat exchanger) contributed to increase the pool temperature up to the saturation condition and induce the natural circulation flow of the PCCT (passive condensate cooling tank) pool water [3]. When a heat rod is placed horizontally in a pool of water, the fluid adjacent to the heat rod gets heated up. In the process, its density reduces and by virtue of the buoyancy force, the fluid in this region moves up. After reaching the top free surface, the heated water moves towards the other side wall of the pool along the free surface. Since this heated water is cooling, it goes downward along the wall at the other side wall. Above <b>heater</b> <b>rod,</b> a natural circulation flow is formed. However, there is no flow below <b>heater</b> <b>rod</b> until pool water temperature increases to saturation temperature. In this study, velocity measurement was conducted to reveal a natural circulation flow structure in a small pool using PIV (particle image velocimetry) measurement technique...|$|E

The local bubble parameters show well three-dimensional characteristics and propagation of a void fraction and an interfacial area concentration along the test section in a subcooled boiling flow.

The independent variables bulk concentration and heat flux have been varied from 0. 8 to 1. 6 g/L and 33 to 300 kW/m 2, respectively. The experimental results show that the mechanisms of fouling on the middle and top heater substantially differ from those at the bottom heater, due to the dominant effects of bubble impingement on the heat transfer surfaces. In particular, the competing effects on the degree of wall superheat and the supersaturation of the boiling liquid play a significant role. Spalling effects are more pronounced on the upper heaters where thin, friable deposits were found with low density and adherence, particularly at higher heat fluxes and lower concentrations.

In a safety analysis, it is of considerable importance to determine the thermal-hydraulic conditions leading to the minimum film boiling temperature, Tmin. A flow boiling rig for measurement of blowdown cooling heat transfer and quench phenomena on a nuclear fuel rod simulator was designed and constructed for operation at up to 12. 4 MPa.

An experimental study using 6 x 6 and 2 x 2 square lattice rod bundles has been performed to investigate the effects of spacer grids on the heat transfer enhancement during a bottom-reflood phase. The spacer grids improve a turbulent mixing of flow and induces breakup of large droplets into smaller ones. These result in the heat transfer enhancement between the fuel rods and the surrounding fluid. Since the geometry of the spacer grid affects the turbulent mixing and droplet breakup behaviors, three types of spacer grids with different geometry were tested in the present study. In order to investigate the heat transfer enhancement by spacer grids, single-phase steam cooling and droplet breakup by spacer grid were separately investigated. For the convective heat transfer enhancement in singlephase steam flow, the <b>heater</b> <b>rod</b> surface temperatures were measured {{in the vicinity of}} the space grid. In single-phase steam cooling experiment, the heat transfer was enhanced at upstream and downstream of spacer grids. Downstream of the spacer, the heat transfer enhancement decays with the distance from the top end of the spacer grid exponentially. The heat transfer enhancement depends on the Reynolds number as well as the flow blockage ratio. A new empirical correlation was developed in order to account for the effect of the Reynolds number. For the droplet breakup experiment, the sizes and velocities of droplets were measured across the spacer grid. The droplet breakup ratio decreases with increasing the Weber number of the droplet impacting on the spacer grid. The droplet breakup ratio by spacer grids was relatively higher than conventional correlations. dc 201...|$|E

The rod bundle has a triangular pitch with a diameter (D) of 0. 635 cm (0. 25 in), and a pitch to diameter (P/D) ratio of 1. 5. The rod bundle has 165 rods with a 15. 24 cm (6 in.) heated length arranged in 55 rows of three rods each. Unheated half rods were positioned on the walls of the test section to maintain the regular rod arrangement and prevent flow bypass along the gaps between the window and the first column of heated rods. A single instrumented heater was positioned five rows upstream from the bundle exit to determine CHF. The last three rows of rods in the bundle were unheated to prevent undetected dryout downstream of the CHF position.

If the spacers were streamlined, removed from the upstream portion of the heater or relocated farther upstream from the downstream end of the heater,there was a considerably reduced effect on the test section performance...|$|R
40|$|Pool boiling heat {{transfer}} in water/glycerol binary solutions has been experimentally investigated on a horizontal <b>rod</b> <b>heater.</b> The experiments have been performed at various concentrations (zero to 35 % mass glycerol) and heat fluxes up to 92 kW m− 2 at atmospheric pressure. The experimental values of boiling {{heat transfer}} coefficient have been compared to main existing correlations. It {{has been shown that}} the various predictions are significantly inconsistent. Based on the high difference between relative volatilities of water and glycerol, a simple model has been proposed to predict the {{boiling heat transfer}} coefficient. The applicability of this model is limited to low concentrations of glycerol and medium/low heat fluxes; however, the predictions are accurate. The proposed model is anticipated to be extendable to other binary systems in which the vapor pressure of one constituent is considerably higher when compared to the other component. S. A.

40|$|Saturated partial {{pool boiling}} heat {{transfer}} has been experimentally investigated on a horizontal <b>rod</b> <b>heater.</b> The boiling liquids are including water and ethanol. The heating section is made by various materials including SS 316, copper, aluminum and brass. Experiments have been performed at several degrees of surface roughness ranging between 30 and 360 micrometer average vertical deviation. The measurements are including {{boiling heat transfer}} coefficient, bubble departing diameter and frequency and also nucleation site density. The data have been compared to major existing correlations. It is shown that experimental data do not match with major correlations at {{the entire range of}} experiments with acceptable accuracy. In this article, the boiling heat transfer area has been divided in two complementary areas, the induced forced convection area and the boiling affected area. Based on two dimensionless groups, including Eötvös and Roshko numbers, a semi-empirical model have been proposed to predict the boiling heat transfer coefficient. It is shown that the proposed model provides improved performance in prediction of the boiling heat transfer coefficient in comparison with to existing correlations...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear power {{reactors}} generate {{highly radioactive}} spent fuel assemblies. Initially, {{the spent fuel}} assemblies are stored {{for a period of}} several years in an on-site storage facility to allow the radioactivity levels of the assemblies to decay. As the radioactive fission product isotopes in the fuel decay, they generate significant amounts of thermal energy producing high temperatures in the spent fuel. The spent fuel from nuclear power plants will eventually have to be transferred to a federal geologic repository in a spent fuel transportation casks. The purpose of this research project is to characterize the relative importance of the heat transfer mechanisms of radiation, conduction, and convection in a dry horizontally-oriented nuclear spent fuel assembly, for eventual application in spent fuel transportation cask design. To determine the relative importance of each heat transfer mode, an experiment was designed and operated to characterize the heat transfer in an 8 x 8 square <b>heater</b> <b>rod</b> array (similar to a Boiling Water Reactor fuel assembly) in a horizontal orientation. The experimental apparatus was operated with the following variable parameters and their ranges: Power to Heater Rods (Controlling Temperatures from 40 'C to 250 'C); Heater Transfer Medium (Air, Nitrogen, Argon, and Helium); Pressure of the Heat Transfer Medium (15 psig, 0 psig, 24 inches of mercury); Power to Boundary Condition Box (not controlled). The experiment was designed, fabricated, and operated under the Sandia National Laboratories-approved MIT Nuclear Engineering Department Quality Assurance Program developed in this work specifically for this project. The test data obtained from the experimental apparatus was analyzed with the lumped keff/hedge model developed by R. D. Manteufel at MIT, in related work on this research project, and the Wooten-Epstein relationship developed at Battelle Memorial Institute. The test data was used to validate the lumped keff/hedge model. Good agreement was found between the lumped keff/hedge model and the test data in each Test Campaign with the exception of Below Atmospheric Pressure data. Both experimental and theoretical sources for the discrepancy are discussed. However, the full reason for the deviation is not know. "September 1991.

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain an {{accurate}} prediction of the thermal behavior of an annular fuel assembly (see MIT-NFC-PR- 048 for {{a description of the}} rods), the thermal conduction of the region from the outside of the fuel capsule to the reactor coolant (within the test assembly) must be known. The effective thermal conductivity of this composite structure is dependent on the interaction of the parts via various physical phenomena, and therefore is difficult to infer accurately from the conductivity of the constituent materials. A mock-up of the annular fuel rod containment thimble was created to allow the conductivity of the annular lead bismuth eutectic-filled gap to be measured. An electric <b>rod</b> <b>heater</b> was used to provide temperatures similar to the in-core environment, and conductivity was determined based on thermocouple temperature readings at various points across the gap. A second series of experiments substituted a steel tube for the aluminum thimble, and used a bucket of stationary water as coolant. The purpose of these changes was to increase the temperature of the eutectic and achieve a larger melted fraction, {{while at the same time}} creating a large enough temperature drop across the gap to allow reliable measurements. A third series of experiments refined the setup and were able to produce more precise measurements of the thermal conductivity. The measured conductivities were between 4 and 8 W/m-K, much lower than the reported conductivity of the lead bismuth at about 10 W/m-K. The difference must be attributed to thermal resistances at the eutectic-aluminum and eutectic-steel interfaces. This, and the inherent difficulty of measuring the interface temperature due to the finite width of the thermocouples and the existence of sharp thermal gradients makes it difficult to further reduce the uncertainty in the measured conductivity...|$|R
