40|$|This paper {{examines}} the depictions of folly on Quijote by Cervantes, {{and on the}} play Enrique IV by Pirandello. In both masterpieces, the folly is an active agent which interchanges comicalness and seriousness; this results in humor, which, as Pirandello states, is “the objectified sense of the opposite”. Being the very antithesis or carnivalization of melancholy, <b>don</b> <b>Quijote’s</b> march is the one of a comedian. As for the pirandellian character, the overturning is sarcastic instead of comical, since the protagonist’s madness is a reaction to outer and inner destructive compulsions that will eventually lead him to destroy his relations to others...|$|R

50|$|Niebla is {{the story}} of Augusto Pérez, a single man, {{philosophical}} and melancholy, who dedicates his time to long walks, and reflection, with his dog Orfeo. Augusto falls in love with Eugenia and idealizes her in a similar way to <b>Don</b> <b>Quijote's</b> idealization of Dulcinea. He dedicates himself to winning her love. The most famous passage of the novel occurs towards the end when the principal character decides to confront the real author, Miguel de Unamuno, to ask for advice about his destiny. The encounter degenerates into a confrontation in which the author decides to kill his character, which leads to the character's death a few pages later.|$|R

30|$|First, {{suppose that}} {{the content of the}} {{relation}} ‘Loves’ is indeed the same in both cases. Both Hitler’s love of Germany and Churchill’s love of England involve the required positive affective, intellectual, volitional, etc. aspects of the relation ‘Loves’ 6 and both persons and collectives involved are adequate subjects of love 7. Thus, there is no ontological difference between them. Given the identity of the content of ‘Loves’ in both cases, it is possible that both Hitler’s love for Germany and Churchill’s love for England are true instances of ‘Loves.’ But we may speculate further and, especially given the complexity of ‘Loves’ as a relation value, find differences. For instance, since Hitler’s love of Germany turned out to be compatible with his willingness to destroy it, we may conclude that he hated Germany {{at least as much as}} he loved it, and such an ambivalence is simply incompatible with love. This is another relation, which may lack a linguistic term, yet ontologically different from both love and hatred. Alternatively, we can imagine some second-order relations intervening, such as corruption or deformation, as in the case of <b>Don</b> <b>Quijote’s</b> misguided heroism. Of course, the instantiation of second-order relations raises further questions, but it is sufficient here to allow for the possibility that, for instance, the proposition ‘Hatred Corrupts Love’ is ontically grounded. The result is the same: ‘Loves’ is different in the two cases. It holds for [c Le] but it does not hold for [h Lg]. Rather, the latter relation is [h CLg], that is, Hitler ‘pervertedly loves’ Germany, or [h HLg], that is, Hitler ‘hates/loves’ Germany.|$|R

25|$|As {{one of the}} few {{discount}} stores in Japan, the end of the Japanese economic bubble did not have disastrous effects for <b>Don</b> <b>Quijote.</b> Instead, the sudden economic uncertainty caused the Japanese public to become more thrifty and therefore helped to boost sales at its stores during the early 1990s.|$|E
25|$|The Baroque is {{the most}} {{important}} period for Spanish culture. We are in the times of the Spanish Empire. The famous <b>Don</b> <b>Quijote</b> de La Mancha by Miguel de Cervantes was written in this time. Other writers from the period are: Francisco de Quevedo, Lope de Vega, Calderón de la Barca or Tirso de Molina.|$|E
25|$|The Juan Bobo tales {{originally}} {{migrated from}} Spain in an oral tradition {{influenced by the}} Spanish picaresque novels (El Lazarillo de Tormes; <b>Don</b> <b>Quijote)</b> and Wise Fool tales. Published anonymously in 1554, El Lazarillo de Tormes is often viewed as the first modern novel, and “picaresque” became the first genre– a genre of realistic fiction in which the pícaro (the rogue) is the central character.|$|E
25|$|In December 2004, four {{stores in}} the Kantō area were damaged or {{destroyed}} by arson attacks. Three store employees, Morio Oshima, 39, Mai Koishi, 20, and Maiko Sekiguchi, 19, died in the first arson incident. In 2007, Noriko Watanabe, 49, {{was found guilty of}} setting the fires and sentenced to life imprisonment. <b>Don</b> <b>Quijote</b> received harsh criticism at the time for poor store layout that made it difficult to find exits.|$|E
25|$|The Cata mine {{is one of}} {{the early}} mines, and a city {{neighborhood}} is named after it. The mine is near the <b>Don</b> <b>Quijote</b> Plaza. It began operations in 1558 with peak production {{in the first quarter of}} the 18th century. It was owned by the Marquis of San Clemente. The center of the neighborhood is the Señor de Villaseca Church, more commonly called the Cata Church. This church was built in the 17th century in Mexican Baroque or Churrigueresque style similar to that of the Valenciana Church. The church holds a valued crucifix called the Señor del Villaseca and is registered as a Mexican Federal Historic Monument.|$|E
25|$|Not many Barbary slaves could {{depend on}} being ransomed by their communities. They had to be deemed worthy of it and many poor people were never ransomed. The tribute prices for the slaves usually varied based on their {{usefulness}} on a ship. So a ship master would cost more than a common seaman. Escaping was another possibility, but rarely successful; Cervantes, future author of <b>Don</b> <b>Quijote,</b> made four unsuccessful attempts to escape from slavery, and was eventually ransomed by his family. Thomas Pellow was a successful escaped slave who published his story in 1740. After several failed attempts, {{in which he was}} nearly killed, Pellow had finally escaped to Gibraltar in July 1738.|$|E
25|$|In Spain, {{interactive}} fiction {{was considered}} a minority genre, and was not very successful. The first Spanish interactive fiction commercially released was Yenght in 1983, by Dinamic Software, for the ZX Spectrum. Later on, in 1987, the same company produced an interactive fiction about <b>Don</b> <b>Quijote.</b> After several other attempts, a company emerged from Dinamic, called Aventuras AD which was the main interactive fiction publisher in Spain, including titles like a Spanish adaptation of Colossal Cave Adventure, an adaptation of the Spanish comic El Jabato, and mainly the Ci-U-Than trilogy, composed by La diosa de Cozumel (1990), Los templos sagrados (1991) and Chichen Itzá (1992). During this period, the Club de Aventuras AD (CAAD), the main Spanish speaking community around interactive fiction in the world, was founded, and {{after the end of}} Aventuras AD in 1992, the CAAD continued on its own, first with their own magazine, and then with the advent of Internet, with the launch of an active internet community that still produces interactive non commercial fiction nowadays.|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, <b>Don</b> <b>Quijote</b> began {{building}} a [...] "half-pipe" [...] roller coaster {{on the roof}} of its eight-story Roppongi store. Roppongi is a heavily populated area in the core of Tokyo, and many residents and businesses were upset with {{the idea of having a}} roller coaster in their neighborhood because of the spectacle, noise and crowds it will likely create. The project was completed in 2006 but due to increasing pressure from concerned groups in the area it has never been operated.

2500|$|In April of that year, Emil Isac {{also joined}} the circle formed around Ion Minulescu and his rebelliously Symbolist magazine, the Bucharest-based Insula. By the same time, the young poet was {{entering}} another polemic {{with the more}} traditionalist wing of Romania's intellectual movement, represented at the time by historian and literary theorist Nicolae Iorga, {{former editor of the}} nationalist tribune Sămănătorul. In 1912, he became a contributor to the short-lived Symbolist review Simbolul, issued in Bucharest by the high school students Tristan Tzara, Marcel Janco and Ion Vinea (all of whom were later avant-garde figures). It was there that Isac published satire specifically aimed at Iorga's group. Those articles where he specifically targeted Iorga's principles enlisted a negative response from Consânzeana, the Orăştie-based review of Romanian Orthodox priest Ioan Moţa (it called Isac <b>Don</b> <b>Quijote</b> de la Cluj, [...] "the Don Quixote of Cluj").|$|E
