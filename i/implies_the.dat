5|$|On Earth, the {{northern}} polar jet stream {{is the most}} important one for aviation and weather forecasting, as it is much stronger and at a much lower altitude than the subtropical jet streams and also covers many countries in the Northern Hemisphere, while the southern polar jet stream mostly circles Antarctica and sometimes the southern tip of South America.

5|$|The Sandilya Upanishad lists ten forbearances: Ahimsa, Satya, Asteya, Brahmacharya, Daya, Arjava, Kshama, Dhriti, Mitahara and Saucha. According to Kaneda, {{the term}} Ahimsa is an {{important}} spiritual doctrine shared by Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. It literally means 'non-injury' and 'non-killing'. It <b>implies</b> <b>the</b> total avoidance of harming {{of any kind of}} living creatures not only by deeds, but also by words and in thoughts.|$|E
5|$|An ideal {{surface is}} flat, rigid, {{perfectly}} smooth, and chemically homogeneous, and has zero contact angle hysteresis. Zero hysteresis <b>implies</b> <b>the</b> advancing and receding contact angles are equal. In other words, only one thermodynamically stable contact angle exists. When {{a drop of}} liquid is placed on such a surface, the characteristic contact angle is formed as depicted in Fig. 1. Furthermore, on an ideal surface, the drop will return to its original shape if it is disturbed. The following derivations apply only to ideal solid surfaces; they are only valid for the state in which the interfaces are not moving and the phase boundary line exists in equilibrium.|$|E

Only after {{the popularity of the}} film was well-established did conservatives embrace the film as an affirmation of traditional values. Burton <b>implies</b> <b>the</b> liberal-left could have prevented the conservatives from claiming rights to the film, had it chosen to vocalize elements of the film such as its criticism of military values. Instead, the liberal-left focused on what the film omitted, such as the feminist and civil rights movements.|$|E
5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings of Corythosaurus and modern birds and {{reptiles}} {{suggest that it}} may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day at short intervals. The sense of hearing in hadrosaurids, specifically such as Lophorhothon, also seems to have been greatly developed because of an elongated lagena. The presence of a thin stapes (an ear bone that is rod-like in reptiles), combined with a large eardrum <b>implies</b> <b>the</b> existence of a sensitive middle ear. It is possible that hadrosaurid ears are sensitive enough to detect as much sound as a modern crocodilian.|$|E
5|$|Einstein's {{theory has}} {{important}} astrophysical implications. For example, it <b>implies</b> <b>the</b> existence of black holes—regions {{of space in}} which space and time are distorted {{in such a way}} that nothing, not even light, can escape—as an end-state for massive stars. There is ample evidence that the intense radiation emitted by certain kinds of astronomical objects is due to black holes; for example, microquasars and active galactic nuclei result from the presence of stellar black holes and supermassive black holes, respectively. The bending of light by gravity can lead to the phenomenon of gravitational lensing, in which multiple images of the same distant astronomical object are visible in the sky. General relativity also predicts the existence of gravitational waves, which have since been observed directly by physics collaboration LIGO. In addition, general relativity is the basis of current cosmological models of a consistently expanding universe.|$|E

Dr. Silva explains to Fauxlivia {{that he wants to}} see through the end of his research, needing only one more human host for a final gestation cycle to birth the queen beetle from which the beetle species, and his cure, can be sustained.

5|$|Gleason's theorem <b>implies</b> <b>the</b> nonexistence {{of certain}} types of hidden {{variable}} theories for quantum mechanics, strengthening a previous argument of John von Neumann. Von Neumann had claimed to show that hidden variable theories were impossible, but (as Grete Hermann pointed out) his demonstration made an assumption that quantum systems obeyed a form of additivity of expectation for noncommuting operators that might not hold a priori. In 1966, John Stewart Bell showed that Gleason's theorem {{could be used to}} remove this extra assumption from von Neumann's argument.|$|E
5|$|Hirschman {{believed}} that Nurkse's balanced growth theory wasn't {{in fact a}} theory of growth. Growth <b>implies</b> <b>the</b> gradual transformation of an economy from one stage to the chronologically next stage. It entails the series of actions which leads the economy from a stage of infancy to that of maturity. However, the balanced growth theory involves {{the creation of a}} brand new, self-sufficient modern industrial economy being laid over a stagnant, self-sufficient traditional economy. Thus, there is no transformation. In reality, a dual economy will come into existence, where two separate economic sectors will begin to coexist in one country. They will differ on levels of development, technology and demand patterns. This may create inequality in the country.|$|E

5|$|Horner did {{not perform}} an exact {{cladistic}} analysis determining {{the relationship between the}} three populations. Such an analysis calculates which evolutionary tree <b>implies</b> <b>the</b> lowest number of evolutionary changes and therefore is the most likely. He assumed that this would result in a tree in which the types were successive branches. Such a tree would, {{as a consequence of the}} method used, never show a direct ancestor-descendant relationship. Many scientists believed such a relation could never be proven anyway. Horner disagreed: he saw the gradual morphological changes as clear proof that, in this case, the evolution of one taxon into another, without a splitting of the populations, could be directly observed. Evolutionists in general would be too hesitant to recognize this. Such a transition is called anagenesis; he posited that, if the opposite, cladogenesis, could not be proven, a scientist was free to assume an anagenetic process.|$|E

5|$|The Church of Scientology depicts Hubbard in hagiographic {{terms and}} draws on his legacy as its {{ultimate}} source of doctrine and legitimacy. The Danish historian of religions Dorthe Refslund Christensen notes that {{many aspects of}} the official version of Hubbard's early life parallel more conventional religious narratives, notably the life of Jesus. Many details of Hubbard's early life remain disputed; critics of Scientology cast doubt on whether he had the educational and personal background claimed by the Church. According to James R. Lewis and Olav Hammer, in Scientology, this hagiographic “construction of Hubbard as a religious ideal <b>implies</b> <b>the</b> construction of Scientology’s texts as humanity’s most important treasure and vice versa.” Religious tradition in Scientology is based on two essential things, Hubbard’s individuality and texts written by him.|$|E

5|$|The {{physiological}} {{function of the}} AH receptor {{has been the subject}} of continuous research. One obvious function is to increase the activity of enzymes breaking down foreign chemicals or normal chemicals of the body as needed. There may be other functions, however, related to growth of various organs or other regulatory functions. The AH receptor is phylogenetically highly conserved transcription factor with a history of at least 500 million years, and found in all vertebrates, and its ancient analogs are important regulatory proteins even in more primitive species. In fact, knock-out animals with no AH receptor are prone to illness and developmental problems. Taken together, this <b>implies</b> <b>the</b> necessity of a basal degree of AH receptor activation to achieve normal {{physiological function}}.|$|E
