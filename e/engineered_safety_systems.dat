40|$|The reactor {{accident}} source term arises in two distinct ways in the US regulatory process. The first is the release of radioactive material to the environment during a hypothetical reactor accident. This source term is an input to models of radionuclide dispersal and accident consequences. It drives measures taken for emergency preparedness and accident response. It is a crucial element of Level III probabilistic risk assessments and also arises in the cost-benefit analyses of safety improvements that go beyond regulatory requirements to provide adequate protection {{of public health and}} safety. The second source term used in the regulatory process is the release of radioactive material to the reactor containment. This source term is used in the analysis of plant sites. It is a defense in depth measure to assess the adequacy of reactor containments and <b>engineered</b> <b>safety</b> <b>systems.</b> This source term also figures in the environmental qualification of equipment within the containment that must function following a design-basis accident.

40|$|AbstractA {{closed loop}} natural {{circulation}} system employs thermally induced density gradients in single phase or two-phase liquid form to induce circulation {{of the working}} fluid thereby obviating the need for any mechanical moving parts such as pumps and pump controls. Due to its passive nature the reliability of these systems is very high. That is the reason natural circulation cooling has been considered in advanced reactor core cooling and in <b>engineered</b> <b>safety</b> <b>systems.</b> Natural circulation cooling has been proposed to remove reactor decay heat by external vessel cooling for in-vessel core retention and for external core catcher cooling during sever accident scenario. First a scaling analysis was carried out for natural circulation flow in a closed loop. Based on the scaling analyses simulation of steam-water natural circulation is carried out with air-water flow in an inclined rectangular channel. The heat flux corresponding to the decay heat is simulated with air flux to the test section to produce equivalent flow quality. Design calculations were carried out for typical core catcher design to estimate the expected natural circulation rates. The natural circulation flow rate {{of the water and}} two-phase pressure drop were obtained for different air injection rate expressed as void fraction for a select downcomer pipe size.

More generally, the methodology is also applicable {{to many other}} engineered systems outside of the nuclear area. Major progress in this project was made in testing and refining the MOCUS-BACFIRE-II-BETAFACTOR analysis code, called MOBB, which takes the system fault tree diagram, generates cutsets and then employs the generic cause method developed by Fussell to identify common cause candidates. Then, the Beta-Factor method developed by Fleming is applied at the single component level to quantify the contribution to total system unavailability of common cause failures. Finally, an uncertainty analysis is performed to generate confidence bounds on both the top event and all cutsets employing both a standard Monte Carlo approach and improved Method-of-Moments method. In addition, a second code was developed to apply the analysis approach of seismic risk analysis using discrete probability distri-bution (DPD) arithmetic. This code was applied to analyze a sample problem fault tree to include failures due to seismic events. This code is available for any follow-up work which should continue to apply the concept of seismic fragility more generally to the component (or system) susceptibility to various common cause events (e. g., corrosion, humidity, temperature, pressure, etc.). ii This project completes {{the final version of}} the fault tree common cause analysis package, MOBB.

40|$|One of the <b>engineered</b> <b>safety</b> <b>systems</b> in the {{advanced}} {{boiling water reactor}} is a passive containment cooling system (PCCS) which is composed {{of a number of}} vertical heat exchanger. After a loss of coolant accident, the pressurized steam discharged from the reactor and the noncondensable (NC) gases mixture flows into the PCCS condenser tube. The PCCS condenser must be able to remove sufficient energy from the reactor containment to prevent containment from exceeding its design pressure. The efficient performance of the PCCS condenser is thus vital to the safety of the reactor. In PCCS condenser tube three flow conditions are expected namely the forced flow, cyclic venting and complete condensation modes. The PCCS test facility consists of steam generator (SG), instrumented condenser with secondary pool boiling section, condensation tank, suppression pool, storage tank, air supply line, and associated piping and instrumentation [...] The specific design of condensing tube is based on scaling analysis from the PCCS design of ESBWR. The scaled PCCS is made of four tubes of diameter 52. 5 mm and height 1. 8 m arranged in square pitch. Steam air mixture condensation tests were carried out in a through flow mode of operation where the mixture flows through the condenser tube with some steam condensation. Data on condensation heat transfer were obtained for two nominal pressures, 225 kPa and 275 kPa and for air concentration fraction from 0 to 13 %. Test results showed that with increase in pressure the condensation heat transfer increased.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{is to develop a}} conceptual design of a particle-bed, gas-cooled fast reactor (PB-GCFR) core that meets the advanced reactor concept and enhanced proliferation-resistant goals of the US Department of Energy's NERI program. The key innovation of this project is the application of a fast neutron spectrum environment to enhance both the passive safety and transmutation characteristics of the advanced particle-bed and pebble-bed reactor designs. The PB-GCFR design is expected to produce a high-efficiency system with a low unit cost. It is anticipated that the fast neutron spectrum would permit small-sized units ({approx} 150 MWe) that can be built quickly and packaged into modular units, and whose production can be readily expanded as the demand grows. Such a system could be deployed globally. The goals of this two-year project are as follows: (1) design a reactor core that meets the future needs of the nuclear industry, by being passively safe with reduced need for <b>engineered</b> <b>safety</b> <b>systems.</b> This will entail an innovative core design incorporating new fuel form and type; (2) employ a proliferation-resistant fuel design and fuel cycle. This will be supported by a long-life core design that is refueled infrequently, and hence, reduces the potential for fuel diversion; (3) incorporate design features that permit use of the system as an efficient transmuter that could be employed for burning separated plutonium fuel or recycled LWR transuranic fuel, should the need arise; and (4) evaluate the fuel cycle for waste minimization and for the possibility of direct fuel disposal.

40|$|The loss of nonemergency {{ac power}} {{is assumed to}} result {{in the loss of}} all power to the station auxiliaries. This {{situation}} could result either from a complete loss of the external grid (offsite) or a loss of the onsite ac distribution system. It is different from the loss of load condition considered in Standard Review Plan (SRP) Section 15. 2. 2 because, in the latter case, ac power remains available to operate the station auxiliaries. The major difference is that in the loss of ac power transient all the reactor coolant circulation pumps are simultaneously tripped by the initiating event. This causes a flow coastdown as well as a decrease in heat removal by the secondary system. Within a few seconds the turbine trips and the reactor coolant system is isolated, causing the pressure and temperature of the coolant to increase. A reactor trip is initiated. The diesel generators are automatically started and provide elec-tric power to the vital loads. The sensible and decay heat loads are handled by actuation of the steam relief system, steam bypass to the condenser, reactor core isolation cooling system in a boiling water reactor (BWR) emergency core cooling system, (BWR) and auxiliary feedwater system in a pressurized water reactor The review of the loss of ac power transient includes the sequence of events, the analytical model, the values of parameters used in the analytical model, and the predicted consequences of the transient.

In this work, a method to develop a PSA model with consideration of the effect of the fault-tolerant techniques in an NPP digital reactor protection system was proposed. Because multiple fault-tolerant techniques have a different inspection range and inspection time, it was proposed to divide the areas according to the inspecting functions. Each area has the specific failure probability and fault detection coverage. For an application, a digital reactor protection system that aims to automatically generate a trip signal in an emergency situation was evaluated. The failure probability and detection methods of each failure mode were identified based on the failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) data.

40|$|Revision I is {{the initial}} {{issue of the}} {{non-proprietary}} version of this WCAP. In {{order to reduce the}} potential for spurious actuation, thereby increasing plant availability, a method has been developed to enable testing of Reactor Trip <b>System</b> (RTS) and <b>Engineered</b> <b>Safety</b> Features Actuation <b>System</b> (ESFAS) channels in the bypass condition as opposed to the "tripped " condition. With a channel in the tripped condition, a second comparator trip in a redundant channel caused by human error, spurious transient, or channel failure will initiate a reactor trip or safeguards actuation. With the Bypass Test Instrumentation (BTI), this spurious reactor trip or safeguards actuation will be avoided, and plant availability will increase. A {{decrease in the number of}} reactor trips and safeguards actuation will also reduce the challenges to the Reactor Protection System (RPS) and avoid the transients associated with reactor trips and safeguards actuation. Test in bypass capability is being provided for NIS reactor trip functions and 7300 Process Protection System (PPS) reactor trip and ESF functions. Various aspects of the BTI installation are addressed in this report. These aspects include a demonstration of the functionality of the BTI hardware, the design features which enable the BTI to conform to U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) guidance governing testing in bypass, and the design features of the BTI that enable it to be in accordance with licensing requirements.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} safety evaluation of complex systems. It proposes an original and rigorous approach that integrates <b>safety</b> analysis in <b>system</b> engineering processes. The approach is based on system engineering (SE) principles and uses the famous industrial SE standard ANSI/EIA- 632. The objective is to help designers and <b>safety</b> <b>engineers</b> in <b>safety</b> management of complex systems. For an efficient design, the model driven design is adopted through the definition of an information model. The system language SysML (System Modeling Language) is used to address requirements definition and their traceability towards the solution and the Verification and Validation (V&V) elements. This common language allows sharing information between the different persons involved in the design project like <b>system</b> <b>engineer</b> and <b>safety</b> <b>engineer...</b>|$|R

The information should include: 1. Descriptions of the experience, tests at simulated accident conditions, or conservative extrapolations from existing knowledge that supports the concept selection upon which the operation of the feature is based; 2.

3000|$|An ECCS {{is one of}} the <b>engineered</b> <b>safety</b> {{features}} and supplies sufficient coolants to a core for maintaining fuel temperatures below its melting point and therefore core meltdown could be avoided in case of a LOCA. An ECCS consists of a <b>safety</b> injection <b>system</b> (SIS) and a shutdown cooling system (SCS). The purpose of the SIS is core heat removal and power decrease via borated water injection following a LOCA. In the APR 1400, emergency coolant is injected from safety injection tanks (SITs) and via safety injection pumps (SIPs) from an in-containment refueling water storage tank (IRWST). The SCS is designed to provide residual heat removal in shutdown situations, which is a long term operation mode [12] [...]...|$|R
