5|$|One dodo was {{reportedly}} sent {{as far as}} Nagasaki, Japan in 1647, but it was long unknown whether it arrived. Contemporary documents first published in 2014 proved the story, and showed that it had arrived alive. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> as a gift, and, despite its rarity, was considered of equal value to a white deer and a bezoar stone. It is the last recorded live dodo in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Sang Pencerah, {{produced}} {{to coincide}} with Muhammadiyah's centenary, was announced in November 2009. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> to be historically accurate, {{with much of the}} Rp. 12 billion (US$ 1.3 million) budget paying for period costumes and sets. However, as documentation on the early years of Dahlan's life is lacking, those scenes were fictionalised. Sang Pencerah marks the feature film debut of Ihsan Tarore and Giring Ganesha.|$|E
5|$|The {{church was}} {{commissioned}} by the noblewoman Anicia Juliana, descendant of several Western emperors, and was constructed between 524 and 527, {{during the reign of}} Justin I (r. 518–527). <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> to replace an earlier church, built by Eudocia, wife of Theodosius II and Juliana's great-grandmother, to enshrine the relic skull of Saint Polyeuctus. The new church was thought to have been the largest in Constantinople before the building of the Hagia Sophia by Justin's nephew and heir, Justinian I (r. 527–565).|$|E

5|$|Wank Week was a {{controversial}} season of television programming that {{was due to}} be broadcast in the United Kingdom by Channel 4, expected to consist {{of a series of}} three documentary programmes about masturbation. However, plans to broadcast it in March 2007 came under public attack from senior television figures, and the planned broadcasts were pulled amid claims of declining editorial standards and controversy over the channel's public service broadcasting credentials. While Wank Week itself was cancelled, the films <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> to showcase may yet be broadcast by the channel at a later date.|$|E
5|$|Early {{in their}} history, Qatna and Yamhad had hostile relations; Amut-piʾel I, in {{alliance}} with Yahdun-Lim and Ḫammu-Nabiḫ (probably king of Tuttul), attacked the Yamhadite city of Tuba, {{which was a}} personal possession of Aleppo's royal family, and took a large booty. Later, Yahdun-Lim embarked on an expedition to the Mediterranean Sea that was used for ideological purposes, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> to echo Gilgamesh's deeds; the journey likely had undeclared political motives as well, when seen {{in the context of}} the alliance with Qatna. The MarioteQaṭanean alliance, which was probably cemented by dynastic marriage, must have provoked Yamhad, which supported rebellions in Mari to preoccupy Yahdun-Lim with his own problems. Despite the tension and battles, a full-scale war with Yamhad was avoided.|$|E
5|$|In 1843, Baldwin {{noticed that}} the Norwalk Seminary, located in Norwalk, Ohio, was {{dissolving}} {{due to lack of}} funds. He approached Thomas Thompson, who was the elder of the Norwalk District (which included Cleveland and Berea), and asked him to visit Berea. At Baldwin's Old Red House, an agreement was made where Baldwin would create a campus on his farm similar to the Norwalk Seminary. Baldwin Institute officially opened on April 9, 1846. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> to open in 1845, but the process was delayed until the completion of a building on Baldwin's farm, which was erected by Baldwin himself, made of stone quarried on his farm and brick made of clay. The institute was open to people of all races, male or female, as Baldwin wanted. It became Baldwin University and was given a charter in 1855. The university later became Baldwin–Wallace College in 1913.|$|E

5|$|In February 1944, Hitler {{approved}} {{the creation of}} an Albanian Waffen-SS division that was to serve only inside Kosovo, and was intended to protect ethnic Albania but remain under German control. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> to be one of three Muslim Waffen-SS divisions serving in the Balkans, the other two being the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian) and the 23rd Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Kama (2nd Croatian). Himmler's goal was to expand Waffen-SS recruiting in the Balkans and form two corps of two divisions each, with one corps to operate in the region of Bosnia in the Independent State of Croatia and the other in Albania. These corps would then be combined with the Volksdeutsche 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen and together would form a Balkan Waffen-SS mountain army of five divisions.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} Battle of Caseros the San Nicolás Agreement was signed. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> {{to comply with}} the {{constitutional}} mandate of the Federal pact that presided over the Argentine Confederation, convening a Constitutional Assembly to meet in Santa Fe. This agreement was not accepted by the province of Buenos Aires, since it reduced its influence and power over the other provinces. Buenos Aires thereupon seceded from the confederation, thus Argentina got divided into two rival, independent states which fought to establish dominance. On the one side were the Federalists of the Argentine Confederation, led by Justo José de Urquiza. On the other, the Autonomists of Buenos Aires. The civil war was only brought to an end with the decisive victory of Buenos Aires over the Federation at the 1861 Battle of Pavón. The bonaerense liberal leader Bartolomé Mitre was elected the first President of a united Argentine Republic in 1862.|$|E
5|$|The Order of Karađorđe's Star {{was instituted}} by the royal decree of King Peter I on 1 January 1904, commemorating his recent {{accession}} to the Serbian throne, {{as well as}} the one-hundredth anniversary of the First Serbian Uprising. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> to replace the Order of the Cross of Takovo and the Order of Miloš the Great, two decorations that had been awarded by the rival Obrenović dynasty, which ruled Serbia prior to the May 1903 coup d'état that reinstated Peter's Karađorđević dynasty after several decades in exile. The first award was disagreeable to the Karađorđevićes and their supporters because it was named after Takovo, the village where Obrenović dynasty founder Miloš Obrenović had launched the Second Serbian Uprising. The Order of Miloš the Great had to be replaced as it was named after Obrenović himself.|$|E

5|$|The album {{revealed}} {{a more personal}} side of the singer, illustrated in its declarative theme of emancipation from her previous marriage, and from her personal and professional setbacks. Although it shared similar vocal production {{as well as an}} inclination to her signature pop and R ballads, the album also encompassed a variety of dance-oriented and uptempo styles. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> to be a continuation, or a second part of her tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). Carey collaborated with a number of artists on the album, including T-Pain, Damian Marley and Young Jeezy. Though considered by critics very similar to the formula its predecessor had been built on, E=MC² included other genres she had never explored, such as reggae, and her continued recording of gospel-influenced hymns.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Imerina was governed through {{a mixture of}} traditional practices and innovative measures. While all land technically belonged to the sovereign, its administration {{was carried out by}} andriana who were assigned a menakely (subdivision of land) to govern. These administrators were themselves overseen by roving royal advisers. The land was cultivated by commoners, who were given a parcel to farm based {{on the size of the}} family <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> to feed, and each family paid taxes to the king in return. Andrianampoinimerina passed laws giving children the right to claim meat from the butcher that had not been sold by the day's end, and allowing the poor to eat cassava from others' fields, provided they took only what they could cook and consume on the spot. In this way, the basic nutritional needs of most citizens were met.|$|E
5|$|The use of sleeve {{valves and}} oil baths to {{lubricate}} {{the moving parts}} of the engine units was inspired by contemporary internal combustion engine practice. This included oscillating gear that gave a 25-degree axial movement to the sleeves, allowing even lubrication of the moving parts. However, this resulted in an over-complicated mechanism that was difficult to maintain, perpetuating the seizures <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> to eradicate. This feature was removed from both bogies of the prototype as the trials progressed. Another innovative feature of the steam bogie assembly was the ability to interchange them when faults occurred, an easy operation for maintenance staff {{when compared to the}} complexities of overhauling a regular steam locomotive's motion.|$|E

5|$|Taiko {{performance}} {{was an important}} part of cultural development by third-generation Japanese residents in North America, who are called sansei. During World War II, second-generation Japanese residents, called nisei faced internment in the United States and in Canada {{on the basis of their}} race. During and after the war, Japanese residents were discouraged from activities such as speaking Japanese or forming ethnic communities. Subsequently, sansei could not engage in Japanese culture and instead were raised to assimilate into more normative activities. There were also prevailing stereotypes of Japanese people, which sansei sought to escape or subvert. During the 1960s in the United States, the Civil Rights Movement influenced sansei to reexamine their heritage by engaging in Japanese culture in their communities; one such approach was through taiko performance. Groups such as San Jose Taiko were organized to fulfill a need for solidarity and to have a medium to express their experiences as Japanese-Americans. Later generations have adopted taiko in programs or workshops established by sansei; social scientist Hideyo Konagaya remarks that this attraction to taiko among other Japanese art forms may be due to its accessibility and energetic nature. Konagaya has also argued that the resurgence of taiko in the United States and Japan are differently motivated: in Japan, {{performance was}} meant to represent the need to recapture sacred traditions, while in the United States <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> to be an explicit representation of masculinity and power in Japanese-American men.|$|E
5|$|For {{his work}} as art director, Yoshida needed to adjust from working on a single static project to {{creating}} artwork assets for a game which would be updated and expanded. While the game world was created around a high fantasy aesthetic, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> to be realistic and encourage exploration. At the beginning of development, the team created a detailed profile of Hydaelyn, including its relation with other planets, ecosystems, climate, and geography. This was done to promote a sense of realism. Alongside creating a seamless travel experience for players, careful work was put into the topography and varied lighting of environments so they would not seem repetitive. After the environment was created, the architectural, cultural and religious elements of the world were incorporated into the environment. City and machine designs mixed metallic and natural materials to create a combined sense of wonder and familiarity for players. The game's five playable races were directly based on the five initial races from Final Fantasy XI, with design adjustments to reflect the new setting. The developers also created two different tribes, {{as opposed to the}} single tribe set-up present in XI. Characters' movements were primarily developed using motion capture, though the recorded movements were then adjusted so they would be sharp and distinctive. Much work was invested in creating emotes, character movements chosen by the player to represent a specific mood or emotion previously used in XI. To create realistic expressions, a character artist manually adjusted the faces for each expression. For the monsters, advances in hardware enabled the team to create more realistic and detailed character models, including detailed skin textures and carefully placed hair follicles.|$|E
