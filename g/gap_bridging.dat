40|$|Abstract. Growing {{demand to}} reduce fuel {{consumption}} has accelerated {{the application of}} Al sheets to the body structure of automobiles. While recent studies on laser welding of Al 5 xxx series and Al 6 xxx series alloys have examined weldability, the laser autogenous welding usually results in low <b>gap</b> <b>bridging</b> capability and weld defects such as porosity, underfill, cracking, and so on. In this study, we evaluated the <b>gap</b> <b>bridging</b> capability and the crack sensitivity during laser autogenous welding, laser welding with filler wire, and laser-arc hybrid welding, respectively. Al 5 J 32 and 6 K 21 sheets were used as the base metal and Al 4 xxx series and Al 5 xxx series wires were used as the filler metal. Employing adequate welding conditions, the <b>gap</b> <b>bridging</b> capability during butt welding was investigated for each welding process. To clarify the solidification crack sensitivity, bead-on-plate welding was implemented for a tapered specimen as a self-restraint crack test. Compared with the laser autogenous welding, laser welding with filler wire and the laser-arc hybrid welding showed improved <b>gap</b> <b>bridging</b> capability and reduced crack sensitivity...|$|E

40|$|In an {{on going}} study of <b>gap</b> <b>bridging</b> for thin plate Nd:YAG laser lap welds, {{empirical}} data, high speed imaging, and computer modeling were utilized {{to better understand}} surface physics attributed to the formation and solidification of a weld pool. Experimental data indicates better <b>gap</b> <b>bridging</b> can be achieved through optimized laser parameters such as pulse length, duration, and energy. Long pulse durations at low energies generating low peak powers were found to create the highest percent of <b>gap</b> <b>bridging</b> ability. At constant peak power, gap-bridging ability was further improved by using a smaller spot diameter resulting in higher irradiances. Hence, welding in focus is preferable for bridging gaps. Gas shielding was also found to greatly impact gap-bridging ability. Gapped lap welds {{that could not be}} bridged with UHP Argon gas shielding, were easily bridged when left unshielded and exposed to only air. Incident weld angle and joint offset were also investigated for their ability to improve <b>gap</b> <b>bridging.</b> Optical filters and brightlight surface illumination enabled high-speed imaging to capture the fluid dynamics of a forming and solidifying weld pool. The effects of various laser parameters and the weld pool's interaction with the laser beam could also be observed utilizing the high-speed imaging. The work described is used to develop and validate a computer model with improved weld pool physics. Finite element models have been used to derive insight into the physics of <b>gap</b> <b>bridging.</b> The dynamics of the fluid motion within the weld pool in conjunction with the free surface physics have been the primary focus of the modeling efforts.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to the problem of <b>gap</b> <b>bridging</b> and junction detection. Perceptual groupings and evidence from existing boundaries are combined to produce joins which are consistent with the initial image structure. In particular, a new definition of co-curvilinearity, which distinguishes between true and false co-curvilinearity, is given. Structural quantities are computed for all potential joins. A local non-iterative algorithm selects the best joins and/or junctions which satisfy specific structural conditions. No assumption, domain restriction, or model is needed. The current implementation is fully presented together with the results obtained.

40|$|AbstractThe {{applicability}} of laser welding processes with its specific advantages, such as low distortion or production efficiency, is often limited when joining thin-walled aluminum components due to small <b>gap</b> <b>bridging</b> ability.

In the present work, the process development for welding in butt-joint configuration is shown. For this purpose, {{the influence of the}} welding speed, wire feed speed and beam oscillation parameters on wire melting behavior and on the welding result is presented. A process window for joining thin sheet material of 1 mm thickness with 1 mm joint gap is shown, and allowable tolerances for laser, wire and gap misalignment are investigated. Furthermore, the reached <b>gap</b> <b>bridging</b> ability of 1. 9 mm for a constant gapand 3. 15 mm for an opening gap configuration is shown in dependence of the utilized aluminum alloys...|$|E

The entire weld seam is irradiated {{as a whole}} and welded with one single laser pulse (sequence). Apart from short process times, which are of interest for big lot production, simultaneous welding allows a more moderate irradiation (interaction). Additionally, it promises wider process windows, a marked <b>gap</b> <b>bridging</b> capability as well as an enhanced weld strength compared to contour welding. By means of appropriate beam forming and guiding a homogeneous intensity distribution fitting to the entire weld seam geometry has to be generated, which represents the challenge of the simultaneous process.

This study sought to identify the regeneration law of nerve fibers in the biological conduit. A nerve regeneration chamber was constructed in models of sciatic nerve injury using 2 -mm small <b>gap</b> sleeve <b>bridging</b> of a biodegradable biological conduit. The results showed that the biological conduit had good histocompatibility. Tissue and cell apoptosis in the conduit apparently lessened, and regenerating nerve fibers were common. The degeneration regeneration law of Schwann cells and axons in the conduit was quite different from that in traditional epineurium suture. During the prime period for nerve fiber regeneration (2 - 8 weeks), the number of Schwann cells and nerve fibers was higher in both proximal and distal ends, and the effects of the small <b>gap</b> sleeve <b>bridging</b> method were better than those of the traditional epineurium suture. The above results provide an objective and reliable theoretical basis for the clinical application of the biological conduit small <b>gap</b> sleeve <b>bridging</b> method to repair peripheral nerve injury. ...|$|R
