50|$|Mark Waid's tenure on {{the title}} in the 1990s brought back more {{traditional}} Flash aspects from Barry Allen's era by reforming the Rogues, {{some of which were}} new incarnations of old characters, and bringing more of a sci-fi/fantasy aspect that had been lost in <b>Flash</b> <b>titles</b> since Allen's departure. Waid made Wally West much more powerful in an attempt to take him out of Barry Allen and Jay Garrick's shadows. Waid and artist Mike Wieringo introduced Impulse in issue #92 (July 1994).

A major shakeup occurred when The Flash would inadvertently kill his wife's murderer, the Reverse-Flash, in The Flash #324 (Aug. 1983). [...] This led to an extended storyline titled [...] "The Trial of the Flash" [...] in which the hero must face the repercussions of his actions.

[...] Describing the first reconstruction attempt in 1975, Everson made it clear that reassembling the available material into a viewable form was a far from trivial task: [...] "A few years ago all that existed of this film were rolls and rolls of negative sections, in which every take--not every sequence, but every take--were sic jumbled out of order, with only a few <b>flash</b> <b>titles</b> for guidance ... and a script that in many ways differed from the play, adding to the herculean task of putting it all together." ...|$|E

5000|$|The series {{presented}} metafictional stories featuring comics creators appearing {{within the}} Flash's adventures {{such as the}} [...] "Flash [...] - [...] Fact Or Fiction" [...] in issue #179 in which the Flash finds himself on [...] "Earth Prime". He contacts the [...] "one man on Earth who might believe his fantastic story and give him the money he needs. The editor of that Flash comic mag !" [...] Julius Schwartz helps the Flash build a cosmic treadmill {{so that he can}} return home. [...] Several years later, the series' longtime writer Cary Bates wrote himself into the story in issue #228. Four months after the cancellation of his own title, Green Lantern began a backup feature in The Flash #217 (Aug.-Sept. 1972) and appeared in most issues through The Flash #246 (Jan. 1977) until his own solo series was revived. Schwartz, who had edited the title since 1959, left the series as of issue #269 (January 1979). Bates wrote The Flash #275 (July 1979) wherein the title character's wife, Iris West Allen was killed. Don Heck became the artist of the series with issue #280 (Dec. 1979) and drew it until #295 (March 1981). The Flash #300 (Aug. 1981) was in the Dollar Comics format and featured a story by Bates and Infantino. Doctor Fate was featured in a series of back-up stories in The Flash from #306 (Feb. 1982) to #313 (Sept. 1982) written by Martin Pasko and Steve Gerber and drawn by Keith Giffen. A major shakeup occurred in the title in the mid-1980s. The Flash inadvertently kills his wife's murderer, the Reverse-Flash, in The Flash #324 (Aug. 1983). [...] This led to an extended storyline titled [...] "The Trial of the Flash" [...] in which the hero must face the repercussions of his actions. Bates became the editor as well as the writer of The <b>Flash</b> <b>title</b> during this time and oversaw it until its cancellation in 1985. [...] "The Trial of the Flash" [...] was collected in a volume of the Showcase Presents series in 2011.|$|R
