40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIt is generally accepted that the ionosphere tilts; {{that is to}} say, an isoionic layer is not at constant height above {{the surface of the}} earth. <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>tilt</b> has the effect of deflecting a radio ray out of its great­ circle plane and returning it to earth at an angle not that of the true bearing from a receiver to a transmitter. The magnitude of error introduced by this effect on radio direction finding (RDF) position estimates was studied in this paper. A model assigning a tilt bias of less than three degrees to each RDF station bearing was constructed. Analysis of a six-station RDF network revealed that this amount of tilt has negligible effect on point estimates of location and their confidence regions. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|Acoustic {{gravity waves}} (AGWs) and {{associated}} travelling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) {{have a significant}} impact on the thermosphere-ionosphere, both by increasing ionospheric variability and transporting energy and momentum. This work demonstrates the use of Dynasonde data products (electron density, ionospheric tilts, Doppler speed) for the study of TIDs and AGWs. The features of Dynasonde-capable instruments make them uniquely fit for this purpose, allowing for the complete characterization of TID activity over large time periods. New spectral analysis techniques are developed, allowing for the accurate characterization of the TID spectrum from periods of several minutes (AGWs) to harmonics of 24 hours (atmospheric tides). A new approach for determining the mean Power Spectral Density (PSD) of TIDs is developed based on the Lomb-Scargle and Welch methods and its accuracy is demonstrated using both synthetic data and <b>ionospheric</b> <b>tilt</b> data from Wallops Island, VA. The method is then used to determine the seasonal variations in the ionosphere due to AGWs. PSDs and integral PSDs of the ionospheric tilts and Doppler speed are used to highlight the presence of a well-known winter peak in TID activity at mid-latitudes in the northern hemisphere, and also a new, previously unreported summer peak. The full set of propagation parameters (frequency, horizontal and vertical wavelength, propagation azimuth) is determined using the electron density and tilt data from Wallops Island. Using these results and the Whole Atmosphere Model (WAM), the agreement between the TID parameters and the gravity wave dispersion relation is demonstrated convincingly within the uncertainty for the first time. This further proves that the observed TIDs are caused by underlying AGWs. Using a month-long dataset obtained in October 2013 at Wallops Island, the statistical distributions of the propagation azimuth, vertical and horizontal wavelength and horizontal phase speed are studied, including their variation with altitude. The impact of AGW dissipation on the background thermosphere-ionosphere is investigated using gravity wave polarization relations and a model of the neutral-ion coupling, obtaining estimates of the momentum flux. In addition to the geophysical results obtained here, the general character of the methods used to obtain them will allow for further studies using Dynasonde data...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. This thesis suggests {{a method to}} estimate the current value of an ionospheric parameter. The proposed method {{is based on the}} known variability of the observed current values near path and utilizes data derived from ionospheric sampling measurements. Analysis of errors is provided in Single-Site-Location High-Frequency Direction Finding (SSL-HFDF), arising from ionospheric irregularities such as Es (sporadic E), <b>ionospheric</b> <b>tilts,</b> and traveling <b>ionospheric</b> disturbances (TIDs). The characteristics of Es, tilts and TIDs for mid-latitudes are summarized in tables. The spatial and temporal coherence of ionospheric variabilities and irregularities is analyzed over the electron density. Practical results, measurements, and studies are presented on SSL-HFDF. A survey of characteristics of the ionosphere in the equatorial region is also provided. Finally, some recommendations are given to maximize the applicability of the proposed method.

40|$|Uniform illumination, over {{space and}} frequency, of the bottom-side {{ionosphere}} {{is important for}} a vertical incidence ionosonde. <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>tilts</b> and structures produce echoes several tens of degrees from vertical even under quiet conditions. Characteristics of traditional traveling wave Delta and Rhombic antennas offer poor frequency and spatial characteristics. An inverted log periodic antenna (LPA) was designed and built for the new vertical incidence VIPIR/Dynasonde ionosonde at the NASA Wallops Flight Facility. An ionosonde specific figure of merit was developed to optimize between the potential antenna designs. Using method of moments, a sensitivity analysis of the physically realized LPA showed the antenna to be a highly stable design. This paper presents {{the capabilities of the}} LPA design to more accurately sample ionospheric dynamics. Objective Vertical incidence ionosonde transmit antennas need to operate over a broad range of frequencies, ideally 300 kHz to 30 MHz, to cover the natural range of ionosphere plasma frequencies. It is also important to illuminate the sky over a broad range of angles around station zenith, ideally ± 60 ◦, to observe the reflections the dynamic ionosphere can produce [1][2]. Uniform polarization allow...|$|R
40|$|The {{intrinsic}} {{high accuracy}} of modern HF direction finders cannot be realized in practice {{due to the}} perturbations and tilts which exist in the ionosphere. Particular attention is given in this dissertation {{to the effect of}} Travelling Ionospheric Disturbances (TIDs) since their occurrence is difficult to predict and the magnitude of the induced bearing error extremely variable. TID activity is quantified by monitoring simultaneously the bearings of a number of transmitters whose locations and frequencies are well known. This information is then employed to determine the expected bearing error on a target transmission reflected in the same area of the ionosphere. The major limitations of this correction scheme are investigated. The large-scale temporal and spatial variations of the quiet ionosphere (Systematic <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>Tilts,</b> SITs) produce bearing errors of similar magnitude to those due to TIDs. Rapid calculation of these errors for various path geometries and ionospheric conditions is possible by raytracing through 3 -D ionospheric models. The limitations of a correction scheme which employs a 3 -D model based on ionospheric predictions are examined. Variance is a particularly useful statistic in assessing the 'reliability' of bearings made on a particular HF circuit. A scheme is proposed in which the bearings of a network of reference transmitters are monitored continuously allowing a variance to be assigned to any target transmission, even if it is only present for a very short time. These variance values are of considerable value in practical DF applications. Whenever possible the experimental observations are related to the underlying physical processes in the ionosphere which generate these DF errors...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, large {{electron}} temperature increases of 300 % (3000 K above background) caused by powerful HF-radio wave injection {{have been observed}} during nighttime using the EISCAT incoherent scatter radar near Tromsø in northern Norway. In a case study we examine the spatial structure of the modified region. The electron heating is accompanied by ion heating of about 100 degrees and magnetic field-aligned measurements show ion outflows increasing with height up to 300 m s− 1 at 582 km. The electron density decreases by up to 20 %. When the radar antenna was scanned between three elevations from near field-aligned to vertical, the strongest heating effects were always obtained in the field-aligned position. When the HF-pump beam was scanned between the same three positions, the heating was still almost always strongest in the field-aligned direction. Simultaneous images of the 630 nm O(1 D) line in the radio-induced aurora showed that the enhancement caused by the HF radio waves also remained localized near the field-aligned position. Coherent HF radar backscatter also appeared strongest when the pump beam was pointed field-aligned. These results are similar to some Langmuir turbulence phenomena which also show a strong preference for excitation by HF rays launched in the field-aligned direction. The correlation {{of the position of}} largest temperature enhancement with the position of the radio-induced aurora suggests that a common mechanism, upper-hybrid wave turbulence, is responsible for both effects. Why the strongest heating effects occur for HF rays directed along the magnetic field is still unclear, but self-focusing on field-aligned striations is a candidate mechanism, and possibly <b>ionospheric</b> <b>tilts</b> may be important...|$|R
40|$|The high {{latitude}} ionosphere {{contains a}} multitude of large-scale ionospheric density structures. These act as tilted reflecting surfaces, which cause HF (3 - 30 MHz) radio signals to deviate from {{the plane of the}} great circle between the transmitter and receiver. There are also a large number of smaller scale electron density irregularities that scatter the signal out of the plane of the great circle. Consequently, measurements of the bearing of incoming HF signals are often found to be displayed from the great circle bearing of the transmitter, sometimes by as much as 100 °. This thesis is a study of bearing measurements obtained during the period 1993 to 1996 over seven high latitude paths of various lengths and orientation. Characteristics of the bearing deviations are found to be strongly related to geophysical parameters such as geomagnetic activity (Ap) indices and the orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field since these also parameterise the morphology of large scale ionospheric density structures. In addition, the daily times of near-great circle propagation are found to relate strongly to Ap on paths lying in the region of the mid-latitude trough. Relationships are identified between bearing deviations and signal parameters such as the signal strength and the Doppler spread of the signal spectrum. Ionograms have been recorded on two paths, and exhibit characteristic features that identify modes of propagation associated with reflections from <b>tilted</b> <b>ionospheric</b> layers and scattering from ionospheric irregularities. The associated bearings have been examined to determine the orientation of these tilts and/or the approximate location of scattering centres. The results of this research may be used as a basis for devising diagnostic tests to determine the level of confidence in the accuracy of bearing measurements made of HF signals at high latitudes...|$|R
