40|$|Abstract. We discuss {{two issues}} of video {{processing}} {{based on our}} recent results: missing data estimation and multiple motion segmentation. We first show that for a rigidly moving scene we can reliably <b>extend</b> <b>interrupted</b> feature point tracking by imposing a geometric constraint based on the affine camera modeling. For scenes of multiple motions, many techniques have been proposed for segmenting moving objects into individual motions. However, many methods perform very poorly for real video sequences. We resolve this mystery by analyzing the geometric structure of the degeneracy of the motion model, {{which leads to a}} new segmentation algorithm. We demonstrate its effectiveness, using real video images. Key words: video processing, feature tracking, missing data estimation, outlier removal, motion segmentation, affine camera model. Video processing is one of the central topics for media technology today, and tracking feature points through the image sequence is a first step of many applications including 3 -D reconstruction. Here, we discuss two issue...|$|R

40|$|The {{investigation}} of the foundational aspects of linguistic mechanisms for programming long running transactions (such as the scope operator of WS-BPEL) has recently renewed the interest in process algebraic operators that interrupt the execution of one process, replacing it with another one called the compensation. We investigate the expressive power of two of such operators, the interrupt operator of CSP and the try-catch operator for exception handling. We consider two non Turing powerful fragments of CCS (without restriction and relabeling, but with either replication or recursion). We show that the addition of such operators strictly increases the expressive power of the calculi. The calculi with replication and either interrupt or try-catch {{turn out to be}} weakly Turing powerful (Turing Machines can be encoded but only nondeterministically). The calculus with recursion is weakly Turing powerful when <b>extended</b> with <b>interrupt,</b> but it is Turing complete (Turing Machine can be modeled deterministically) when extended with try-catch...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe crystal {{structure}} of down-regulated NhaA crystallized at acidic pH 4 [21] {{has provided the}} first structural insights into the antiport mechanism and pH regulation of a Na+/H+ antiporter [22]. On {{the basis of the}} NhaA {{crystal structure}} [21] and experimental data (reviewed in [2, 22, 38] we have suggested that NhaA is organized into two functional regions: (i) a cluster of amino acids responsible for pH regulation (ii) a catalytic region at the middle of the TM IV/XI assembly, with its unique antiparallel unfolded regions that cross each other forming a delicate electrostatic balance {{in the middle of the}} membrane. This unique structure contributes to the cation binding site and allows the rapid conformational changes expected for NhaA. <b>Extended</b> chains <b>interrupting</b> helices appear now a common feature for ion binding in transporters. However the NhaA fold is unique and shared by ASBTNM [30] and NapA [29]. Computation [13], electrophysiology [69] combined with biochemistry [33, 47] have provided intriguing models for the mechanism of NhaA. However, the conformational changes and the residues involved have not yet been fully identified. Another issue which is still enigma is how energy is transduced “in this ‘nano-machine. ’” We expect that an integrative approach will reveal the residues that are crucial for NhaA activity and regulation, as well as elucidate the pHand ligand-induced conformational changes and their dynamics. Ultimately, integrative results will shed light on the mechanism of activity and pH regulation of NhaA, a prototype of the CPA 2 family of transporters.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Permanent ice patches in {{the western}} Canadian Subarctic have been {{recently}} identified as sources of cryogen-ically preserved artifacts and biological specimens. The formation, composition, and constancy of these ice patches {{have yet to be}} studied. As part of the Northwest Territories (NWT) Ice Patch Study, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and ice coring were used to examine the stratigraphy and internal structure of two ice patches. Results show the patches are composed of a core of distinct offset units, up to several metres thick, covered by a blanket of firn and snow. The interfaces between the units of ice are often demarcated by thin sections of frozen caribou dung and fine sediment. Radiocarbon dates of dung extracted from ice cores have revealed a long history for these perennial patches, up to 4400 years BP. Ice patch growth is discontinuous and occurs intermittently. Extensive time gaps exist between the units of ice, indicating that summers of catastrophic melt can <b>interrupt</b> <b>extended</b> periods of net accumulation. The results of this work not only display the character of ice patch development, but also indicate the significant role that ice patches can play in reconstructing the paleoenvironmental conditions of an area...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} an extensive analysis of new communication technologies (NCTs), which includes email technology, the Internet, intranets, NetMeeting, video-conferencing and audio-conferencing, within an organisational context. These technologies have become ubiquitous in organisational life and work. The implementation, integration {{and application of}} NCTs in this setting have both innovative possibilities and negative consequences. Consequently, {{we need to understand}} the implications of these technologies on organisational cultures and structures. This is achieved throughout this thesis by focusing upon the context of technology implementation, the transformation of communication and information lines through and within the organisation, and the changing social networks and interactions. 'Communication Technologies at Work' will explain and critically explore the effects of NCTs whilst developing an understanding of the implications for its employment in the work and the training settings of an organisation. It is based upon the ethnographic study of a hi-tech organisation and draws upon the narratives of the organisational members collected through in-depth interviewing. Further data was collected utilising observational and survey methods. The research methodology of this study is distinctive because NCTs were used as methodological tools for carrying out the observations and distributing the surveys. Although a traditional methodological stance was adopted the study will further develop this tradition. It will analyse the relationship between NCTs and organisational cultural responses, by studying and interpreting the personal narratives of organisational employees. This study offers an original understanding of NCTs through the narratives of the organisational members and this forms the basis for its substantive contribution to existing research in this subject area. The importance of the narrated experiences of organisational employees negotiating the introduction of NCTs will be emphasised throughout and will be used to create the framework for the analysis. This thesis will conclude that organisational cultures have been 'technologised' through the application of NCTs. This is characterised by 'the ethos of technology enthusiasts' and 'the ethos of technology sceptics'. These positive and sceptical subcultures are embedded in the dominant organisational culture. Furthermore, this study will demonstrate that organisational communication and information flows have been altered, <b>extended</b> and <b>interrupted</b> with the advent of NCTs in the work setting. Finally, the discussion of the role of these technologies in the work and training settings of the case study organisation suggest that the consequences of their implementation and use vary in these different contexts...|$|R
40|$|Polydiacetylenes (PDAs) {{exhibit a}} {{chromatic}} response to solvents, temperature, strain {{and other environmental}} perturbations. When formed in a solid-state polymerization, {{the backbone of the}} polymer is planar which provides extended conjugation polymer backbone. However, when an external force is exerted on the backbone, the <b>extended</b> conjugation is <b>interrupted</b> and an optical shift from blue to red is observed. A system using conjugated PDA Nano structures has been developed as a model to study the reversibility in the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and electronic absorption of the PDA liposome particles. In the first study, a reversible system composed of PDA and Sulforrhodamine- 101 was utilized where PDA and SR - 101 act as acceptor and donor respectively. Colorimetric transition from blue to red in PDA liposomes was achieved through heating the conjugated liposomes. In this work, the FRET mechanism was evaluated without violating the role of nature that energy flows 2 ̆ 2 down 2 ̆ 2 hill and that the role of donor and acceptor in FRET are fixed. Reversible interchanging roles of donor and acceptor over many thermo-chromatic cycles in a modified-PDA-SR 101 liposomal system were also evaluated. 	The nanotubes synthesized are thus unique and robust. The characterization studies showed that the nanotubes are both in Nano and micro scale. Thus the self-assembled chemistry using this material would find wide applications in such areas such as sensors, actuators, and computational devices at both micro and nano scale and further studies might offer them as an encapsulation drug delivery vehicle. Both these studies offer a new insight to the unique properties of polymerized PDA liposomes...|$|R
40|$|To analyse {{the results}} of the mid-term {{clinical}} and echocardiographic follow-up of the pediatric Ross operation. Echo-Doppler follow-up of 53 consecutive pediatric Ross procedures performed between 1994 and 2003. Median age was 9. 7 years at time of operation (2 weeks- 17. 7 years). Six patients were younger than 3 months. Median age at follow-up was 15. 6 years. Aortic valve/left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) anomalies were congenital in 49 (92 %). Seventy percent had previous surgery or balloon valvuloplasty. Root replacement was used in all. Thirteen patients (25 %) had LVOT enlargement. Mean cross-clamp time was 113 (69 - 189) minutes. Early mortality occurred in 3 patients after emergency surgery following balloon failure (n= 1) and <b>extended</b> Ross following <b>interrupted</b> arch/VSD repair (n= 2). Late mortality was due to LV fibroelastosis in 2 patients and complicated pulmonary artery stenting in another. RVOT reoperations were required because of late homograft obstruction in 2 patients and because of pulmonary artery stenosis in another. Five patients (9. 4 %) were reoperated for pulmonary autograft dilatation (n= 3) and for leaflet fibrosis or perforation (n= 2). Autografts were repaired in two patients, while a mechanical valve was inserted in 3 cases. At 9 years the actuarial survival and event free survival were 89 and 74 %, respectively. At last follow-up 90 % of autograft diameters indexed to body surface area was above the 90 th percentile of normal aortic root diameters. LVOT and RVOT gradients were low and autograft insufficiency was trivial to mild in 84 % and mild to moderate in 16 %. Autograft stenosis was not noticed. The pediatric Ross procedure remains an important tool but autograft dilatation also occurs in the pediatric population. The significance of this finding has yet to be determine...|$|R
40|$|Uniquely in the Southern Hemisphere the New Zealand micro-continent {{spans the}} {{interface}} between a subtropical gyre and the Subantarctic Circumpolar Current. Its 20 ° latitudinal extent includes a complex of submerged plateaux, ridges, saddles and basins which, in the present interglacial, are partial barriers to circulation and steer the Subtropical (STF) and Subantarctic (SAF) fronts. This configuration offers a singular opportunity to assess the influence of bottom topography on oceanic circulation through Pleistocene glacial - interglacial (G/I) cycles, {{its effect on the}} location and strength of the fronts, and its ability to generate significant differences in mixed layer thermal history over short distances. For this study we use new planktic foraminiferal based sea-surface temperature (SST) estimates spanning the past 1 million years from a latitudinal transect of four deep ocean drilling sites. We conclude that: 1. the effect of the New Zealand landmass was to deflect the water masses south around the bathymetric impediments; 2. the effect of a shallow submerged ridge on the down-current side (Chatham Rise), was to dynamically trap the STF along its crest, {{in stark contrast to the}} usual glacial-interglacial (G-I) meridional migration that occurs in the open ocean; 3. the effect of more deeply submerged, downstream plateaux (Campbell, Bounty) was to dynamically trap the SAF along its steep southeastern margin; 4. the effects of saddles across the submarine plateaux was to facilitate the development of jets of subtropical and subantarctic surface water through the fronts, forming localized downstream gyres or eddies during different phases in the G-I climate cycles; 5. the deep Pukaki Saddle across the Campbell-Bounty Plateaux guided a branch of the SAF to flow northwards during each glacial, to form a strong gyre of circumpolar surface water in the Bounty Trough, especially during the mid-Pleistocene Climate Transition (MIS 22 - 16) when exceptionally high SST gradients existed across the STF; 6. the shallower Mernoo Saddle, at the western end of the Chatham Rise, provided a conduit for subtropical water to jet southwards across the STF in the warmest interglacial peaks (MIS 11, 5. 5) and for subantarctic water to flow northwards during glacials; 7. although subtropical or subantarctic drivers can prevail at a particular phase of a G-I cycles, it appears that the Antarctic Circumpolar Current is the main influence on the regional hydrography. Thus complex submarine topography can affect distinct differences in the climate records over short distances with implications for using such records in interpreting global or regional trends. Conversely, the local topography can amplify the paleoclimate record in different ways in different places, thus enhancing its value for the study of more minor paleoceanographic influences that elsewhere are more difficult to detect. Such sites include DSDP 594, which like some other Southern Ocean sites, has the typical late Pleistocene asymmetrical saw-tooth G-I climate pattern transformed to a gap-tooth pattern of quasi-symmetrical interglacial spikes that <b>interrupt</b> <b>extended</b> periods of minimum glacial temperatures...|$|R
