40|$|Abstract Background The {{quadriceps}} femoris muscle ruptures usually {{occur in}} the middle-aged population. We present a 4 -year-old patient with partial rupture of the quadriceps femoris muscle. To our knowledge, this is the youngest patient reported with a quadriceps femoris muscle rupture. Case Presentation A 4 -year-old girl admitted to our clinic with left knee pain and limitation in knee movements. Her father reported that she felt pain while jumping on sofa. There was no direct trauma to thigh or knee. We located a palpable soft tissue swelling at distal anterolateral side of thigh. The history revealed that 10 days ago the patient was treated for upper tract respiratory infection with intramuscular Clindamycin for 7 days. When we consulted the patient with her previous doctor and nurse, we learnt that multiple daily injections might be injected to same side of left thigh. MRI showed a partial tear of vastus lateralis muscle matching with the injection sites. The patient treated with long leg <b>half-casting</b> for three weeks. Clinical examination and knee flexion had good results with conservative treatment. Conclusions Multiple intramuscular injections may contribute to damage muscles and make prone to tears with muscle contractions. Doctors and nurses must be cautious to inject {{from different parts of}} both thighs. </p...|$|R
60|$|For the rest, {{it is of}} {{no public}} interest, {{resembling}} as it does the experience {{of more than one}} Central African traveller. Suffice it to say, that we did, after incredible hardships and privations, reach the Zambesi, which proved to be about a hundred and seventy miles south of where Billali left us. There we were for six months imprisoned by a savage tribe, who believed us to be supernatural beings, chiefly on account of Leo's youthful face and snow-white hair. From these people we ultimately escaped, and, crossing the Zambesi, wandered off southwards, where, when on the point of starvation, we were sufficiently fortunate to fall in with a <b>half-cast</b> Portuguese elephant-hunter who had followed a troop of elephants farther inland than he had ever been before. This man treated us most hospitably, and ultimately through his assistance we, after innumerable sufferings and adventures, reached Delagoa Bay, more than eighteen months from the time when we emerged from the marshes of Kôr, and the very next day managed to catch one of the steamboats that run round the Cape to England. Our journey home was a prosperous one, and we set our foot on the quay at Southampton exactly two years from the date of our departure upon our wild and seemingly ridiculous quest, and I now write these last words with Leo leaning over my shoulder in my old room in my college, the very same into which some two-and-twenty years ago my poor friend Vincey came stumbling on the memorable night of his death, bearing the iron chest with him.|$|E
60|$|XLI. Pure {{architectural}} decoration, then, may {{be considered}} as limited to the four kinds above specified; of which each glides almost imperceptibly into the other. Thus, the Elgin frieze is a monochrome {{in a state of}} transition to sculpture, retaining, as I think, the <b>half-cast</b> skin too long. Of pure monochrome, I have given an example in Plate VI., from the noble front of St. Michele of Lucca. It contains forty such arches, all covered with equally elaborate ornaments, entirely drawn by cutting out their ground to about the depth of an inch in the flat white marble, and filling the spaces with pieces of green serpentine; a most elaborate mode of sculpture, requiring excessive care and precision in the fitting of the edges, and of course double work, the same line needing to be cut both in the marble and serpentine. The excessive simplicity of the forms will be at once perceived; the eyes of the figures of animals, for instance, being indicated only by a round dot, formed by a little inlet circle of serpentine, about half an inch over: but, though simple, they admit often much grace of curvature, as in the neck of the bird seen above the right hand pillar.[14] The pieces of serpentine have fallen out in many places, giving the black shadows, as seen under the horseman's arm and bird's neck, and in the semi-circular line round the arch, once filled with some pattern. It would have illustrated my point better to have restored the lost portions, but I always draw a thing exactly as it is, hating restoration of any kind; and I would especially direct the reader's attention to the completion of the forms in the sculptured ornament of the marble cornices, as opposed to the abstraction of the monochrome figures, of the ball and cross patterns between the arches, and of the triangular ornament round the arch on the left.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{disinfection}} {{of dental}} stone casts using microwave radiation has been shown, but doubts remain regarding its efficacy under various conditions. The {{aim of the}} present study was to evaluate the efficacy of microwave disinfection on wet and dry dental stone casts contaminated by a resistant microorganism. Material and methods: In this in vitro study, 34 stone <b>half-casts</b> were prepared, contaminated with and divided into two groups. After drying the specimens of one group for 15 minutes using 450 W microwave energy, all the wet and dry specimens were exposed to 900 W microwave energy for 5 minutes. Specimens were then individually transferred to nutrient broth culture medium and after, one milliliter from each tube was cultured in nutrient agar media for 24 hours, and the colonies were counted in CFU/mL. Data were analyzed using multifactorial ANOVA and Bonferroni tests. Results: Casts in both wet and dry groups were disinfected to a high level (6 log), with no statistically significant differences between them (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: According to the results, microwave irradiation can disinfect dental stone casts to a high degree, irrespective of moisture level. However, the result should be confirmed by exploring with other species of resistant microorganisms...|$|R
40|$|Scanning {{electron}} microscopic {{observation of}} corrosion casts is the finest technique to describe spatial patterns of microvessels in many organs, giving a readily interpreted representation of their vascular architecture without interference from surrounding tissues. We {{focused on the}} renal cortex of guinea pigs to make an in-depth morphological analysis of structural and ultrastructural details left by the cells on the resin cast. In addition, we made a qualitative description of normal variants usually observed in glomerular disposition, arteriolar morphology or capillary arrangement in the space to shed more light {{on the relationship between}} vascular tissue and surrounding cells. The study also disclosed some examples of vascular adaption to physiological and pathological conditions occurring in renal microvessels such as many systems essential to flow regulation, filtration and excretory processes. At lower magnification, all major vessels can be readily distinguished: interlobar, arciform and interlobular arteries and veins, along with a web of peritubular and capsular capillaries. At higher magnification, the glomeruli become visible and the afferent and efferent arteries and the tortuosity the inner vessels can be distinguished. In some of them, the resin, due to the narrowing sizes, suddenly stopped leaving a <b>half-casted</b> glomerulus. This helped to reveal its internal circulation characterized by thin capillaries {{with a high degree of}} bi or trifurcation. In addition, we confirmed the close correspondence between cellular ultrastructural detail (pores, corrugations of cellular membrane, perivascular cell branches) and the impressions left on the resin visible only at high magnifications...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of a research project on the effect of geology on the fragmentation of rock excavated by blasting in underground developments. The research was undertaken at CANMET's Experimental Mine in Val-d'Or, Quebec. A total of thirteen (13) blasts were studied from November 1994 to February 1995. The analysis of each blast was divided into three stages: (1) Pre-blast: includes structural mapping, rockmass characterization, estimation of the in situ block size distribution and documentation of the blast design. (2) Blast: includes blast vibration monitoring and analysis. (3) Post-blast: includes determination of fragment size distribution, <b>half-cast</b> factors and bootlegs. The blast design was kept as constant as possible throughout the study in order to limit the variation of parameters to the geology-related ones. The results were analyzed to determine any correlation between the rockmass characteristics and the blast results. Only general trends were found: (1) The characteristic size of the fragments obtained after blasting (x$ rm sb{c}$ blast) increases when the characteristic size of the in situ distribution (x$ rm sb{c}$ in situ) increases; (2) The characteristic size of the fragments obtained after blasting (x$ rm sb{c}$ blast) decreases when the adjusted powder factor increases; (3) The <b>half-cast</b> factor (HCF) decreases when the Rock Quality Designation (RQD), RMR and Q values increase; (4) The characteristic size of the fragments obtained after blasting (x$ rm sb{c}$ blast) increases when the RQD, Rock Mass Rating (RMR) and quality index (Q) values increase. Some of these results confirm basic blasting principles whereas others were unexpected. The fact that no statistical correlation could be found is probably due to the geological environment in which the experiments were completed. The rock types encountered have very similar mechanical properties {{and the quality of the}} rockmasses did not vary extensively. Therefore, any variance in the results is best explained by the blast performance itself. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: During the 1980 s, Thatcher’s {{economic}} revolution {{brought about}} important ideological and cultural implications {{closely related to}} the issue of identity construction. The Raj Revival cinematic productions apparently reflected the Conservative government’s return to the values of the past. Nonetheless, a deeper analysis of these productions also points to their ambiguous nature in their portrayal of gender, race and class tensions. My aim in this essay is to demonstrate how the 1984 TV series The Far Pavilions reflects this conflict of identities, especially through the analysis of the main character, a British subject raised by an Indian family who {{falls in love with a}} <b>half-cast</b> Indian princess. Key words: cinema, identity, race, gender, Thatcher. Resumen: Durante los años 80, la revolución económica thatcheriana llevó implícitos cambios ideológicos y culturales estrechamente relacionados con el tema de la construc-ción de la identidad. Las producciones denominadas “Raj Revival ” reflejaban aparente-mente el retorno a los valores del pasado defendido por el gobierno conservador. Sin embargo, un análisis más detallado de estas producciones también indica una gran ambi-güedad en el retrato de las tensiones existentes entre género, raza y clase. En este ensayo intentaré demostrar cómo la serie británica The Far Pavilions refleja este conflicto de identidades a través del personaje principal, un británico criado por una familia india que se enamora de una princesa indica mestiza.

40|$|Contour {{blasting}} {{is commonly}} performed by employing linear charges, decoupled from the boreholes. This method {{is common in}} surface and underground excavations, either for civil or mining purposes. To achieve the best results in terms of rock breakage and respect of the excavation profile, blasting theory suggests that charges should be inserted coaxial to the holes to grant uniform distribution of the explosive energy and therefore obtaining a uniform Radius of Damage. Nonetheless, due to readiness of operations or lack of availability of specific products on the market, non-coaxial charges are often employed in blasting practice. Non-coaxial charging methods include the employ of high-power detonating cord (40 to 100 g/m), low-power detonating cord connecting small-diameter cartridges (commonly 10 g/m detonating cord priming 1 " cartridges) or string loading (a thin layer of bulk emulsion pumped with controlled flow and controlled extraction of the injecting rod). This research focuses on evaluating {{the effects of the}} first two charging methods on the quality of final walls in open-pit and underground operations. Different drilling geometries and charging configurations were applied to both quarrying and tunneling blasts. The <b>Half-Cast</b> Factor (HCF), the Over-break (OB) and the Under-Break (UB) were evaluated as control indicators. Rock Quality Designation (RQD) and Rock Mass Rating (RMR) were used to classify the rock mass. The research was aimed to push contour blasts to their limits, observing for which geometry and charge configuration the blast lost its design threshold with respect to the final wall for every given rock mass. Results show the operational limits of non-coaxial charges encountered in the rock masses object of this study. In good-quality rock, smooth blasting with decoupled linear charge of 40 g/m can be extended to a spacing S = 22 Øf with little or no detectable drawbacks in terms of final wall quality, in contrast with theoretical formulae for the determination of the radius of damage. On the other hand, when the rock is poor, any quality of the final wall is hardly achieved at all, in spite of any care in the details of execution of smooth blasting. It is concluded that any design criterion and theoretical approach modeling the effects of contour blasting cannot ignore the features of the rock mas...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} are {{to explain how the}} orphan Kim, as the main character in Kim novel by Rudyard Kipling, lives and survives in his eastern and western environments, fulfills his self-actualization process, and figures out what really identity he really wants. This research belongs to qualitative research with the application of Abraham Maslow’s theory of human needs and the theory of identity by James Marcia. The main data of this research are the conversation between Kim and the lama, and other conversations among other characters which {{have something to do with}} the title of this thesis, while supporting data come from other texts which are connected with the analysis. They are articles on internet, some criticisms from internet, and other books which are related to the issues. The two first problem statements are answered by comparing Abraham Maslow’s theory of human needs with Kim’s psychological aspects. Meanwhile, the third question is answered by comparing the theory of identity by James Marcia with Kim’s identity process. Based on the comparison result, the life condition of Kim was finally revealed. Kim lived and survived well in his environment with the local people in Lahore, India. He had many local friends who he could get help from. The <b>half-cast</b> woman looked after him since his very young age until teenage. Some other local people and the Red Bull also had the roles to help Kim live and survive. The local people gave him friendship, love, and care while the Red Bull gave him job, money, education, and prestige. Kim successfully tried to fulfill his human needs from the very basic up to the highest. In Kim’s case, his self-actualization process was carried out through his personal growth and the eastern wisdom showed by his spiritual teacher i. e. the lama. Almost all the characteristics of a self-actualizer were shown by his behavior. Moreover, the issue of Kim’s dual identity was also revealed. It seemed that Kim had two identities but he tended to choose the eastern identity rather than the western one. In the eastern identity, Kim felt love, friendship, wisdom, comfort, simplicity in life, peace, and harmony, while his western identity was close to war, violence, killing, blood shed, espionage, danger, restlessness, and greed. However, both eastern and western identities in Kim could not be separated. Key words: Kim Novel, Human Needs, Abraham Maslow, Theory of Identity...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo {{primordial}} dessa pesquisa é examinar a representação pictórica e fotografica do negro no Brasil. O uso da indumentária retrada serviu como refêrencia principal na observação e análise das imagens. Foram estudadas obras realizadas durante o periodo de 1850 a 1890, com ênfase naquelas que posuem conteúdo típico e recorrente. A utilização dos trajes foi considerada como um indicativo de condição social constituite da indentidade negra, idealizada por meio de uma perspectiva da população branca. Examinei as caracteristicas em comum nas imagens e a relação da indumentária associada aos papéis sociais, vinculados ás vestimentas que integram as obras. Pesquisadores lançam mão de vários tipos de material como fonte de pesquisa. Entretanto, fontes não escritas são por muitas vezes pouco creditadas, funcionando apenas como simples ilustrações e textos. Nesse caso, podem agregar novos significados aos textos que ilustram, ou perpetuar idéias racistas. Para realizar as análises das imagens, considerei a historiografica concernente ás origens da representação do negro nas artes brasileiras, à moda, à fotografia, às heranças africanas, às teorias perspectivas, às influências da Missões artísticas que viveram ao Brasil e às teorias evolucionistas vigentes durante as últimas décadas do século dezenove. Fótografos como Christiano Júnior, Militão e Victor Frond produziram inúmeras fotografias de negros que foram comercializadas aos europeus como material etnográfico e ilustração do exótico, no final do século dezenove. Pintores com Biard e Pallière destacaram o cotidiano dos negros. Negras vendedoras de frutas, amas-de-leite, negros e mestiços embranquecidos e homens executando trabalhos braçais, são exemplos de uma figuração padronizada e perpetuada, a estética da escravidão. Essas figuras constituem meu foco investigativo para a reflexão acerca da iconografia do negro. The {{primary objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the pictorial and photographic representation of the black people in Brazil. The way the costumes were worn was the basis for the observations and image analysis. The pieces studied comprehend the period from 1850 to 1890 with emphais to typical and recurrent content. The way the outfits were was considered as an indicator of the black communit identity, idealized throught the viewpoint of the white population. The common characteristics of the studied paitings and photographs, as well as the relation between the costumes and their social roles connected to the relation between the costumes and their social roles connected to the observed pieces, were examined. Researches make use of various types of materials as source of inquiry. However, pictorial sources often black credit and are seen as mere text illustrations. In the case, these images can add to the texts they depict or perpetuate racist ideas. In order to carry out the image analysis, the historiography as regards the original representation of the black brasilian population as regards art, fashion, photography, African heritrage, perceptive theories, the influence of the artistic Missions that came to Brazil and the evolutionist theory in vogue during the last decades of the nineteen-century were considered. Phootographer like Christiano Júnior, Militão and Victor Frond produced countles photographs of the people that were sold in the European market as ethographic material and ilustration of the exotic. Paintes like Biard and Palliére have singled out the bach peoples everyday life. Black womens selling fruits or breat-feeding whitened black and <b>half-cast</b> people, and men handling heavy work are examples of a standard everlasting representation, the slavery aesthetics.
