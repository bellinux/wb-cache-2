40|$|Heavy oil is {{a common}} fuel for {{industrial}} furnaces, boilers, marines and diesel engines. Previous studies showed that the combustion of heavy oil involves not only the complete burning of volatile matters but also the burn-out of coke residues. Detailed knowledge about heavy oil combustion therefore requires {{an understanding of the}} different burning stages of heavy oil droplets in the burner. This in turn, demands knowledge about the single droplet evaporation and combustion characteristics. This study measured the temperature and size histories of heavy oil (C glass) droplets burning in microgravity to elucidate the various stages that occur during combustion. The elimination of the gravity-induced gas convection in microgravity allows the droplet combustion to be studied in greater detail. Noting that the compositions of heavy oil are various, we also tested the fuel blends of a diesel light oil (LO) and a <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> <b>residue</b> (HOR) ...|$|E

Two different kinds of fuels were used, a sulfur-free kerosene and one that contained 0. 57 mass-% sulfur. Both fuels were continuously evaporated and directly fed into the chemical-looping reactor. Experiments were conducted for 50 h with the sulfur-free kerosene and for 30 h with the sulfurous kerosene. CO 2 yields above 99 % were achieved with both types of fuel.

However, due to rapid population growth, the consumption of fuels, energy, and petrochemical products has been increasing tremendously. Thus, new challenges for the petroleum refineries to upgrade <b>heavy</b> <b>oils</b> and <b>residues</b> are (1) to produce more middle distillate products [1, 2, 3], (2) high-quality transportation fuels, and (3) depletion of crude oil sources [4].

40|$|The {{biodegradability}} {{of seven}} different crude oils {{was found to}} be highly dependent on their composition and on incubation temperature. At 20 C lighter oils had greater abiotic losses and were more susceptible to biodegradation than <b>heavier</b> <b>oils.</b> These light crude oils, however, possessed toxic volatile components which evaporated only slowly and inhibited microbial degradation of these oils at 10 C. No volatile toxic fraction was associated with the <b>heavier</b> <b>oils</b> tested. Rates of oil mineralization for the <b>heavier</b> <b>oils</b> were significantly lower at 20 C than for the lighter ones. Similar relative degradation rates were found with a mixed microbial community, using CO 2 evolution as the measure, and with a Pseudomonas isolate from the Arctic, using O 2 consumption as the measure. The paraffinic, aromatic, and asphaltic fractions were subject to biodegradation. Some preference was shown for paraffin degradation, especially at low temperatures. Branched paraffins, such as pristane, were degraded at both 10 and 20 C.

40|$|The {{growing demand}} for {{high-quality}} middle distillates is increasing worldwide, whereas the demand for low-value oil products, such as <b>heavy</b> <b>oils</b> and <b>residues,</b> is decreasing. Thus, maximizing the production of more liquid distillates of very high quality is of immediate interest to refiners. At the same time, environmental legislation has led to more strict specifications of petroleum derivatives. Hydrotreatment (HDT) of crude oil {{is one of the}} most challenging tasks in the petroleum refining industry, which has not been reported widely in the literature. In this work, crude oil was hydrotreated upon a commercial cobalt¿molybdenum on alumina (Co¿Mo/¿-Al 2 O 3) catalyst presulfided at specified conditions. Detailed pilot-plant experiments were conducted in a continuous-flow isothermal trickle-bed reactor (TBR), and the main hydrotreating reactions were hydrodesulfurization (HDS), hydrodenitrogenation (HDN), hydrodeasphaltenization (HDAs), and hydrodemetallization (HDM), which includes hydrodevanadization (HDV) and hydrodenickelation (HDNi). The reaction temperature (T), the hydrogen pressure (P), and the liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) were varied with certain ranges, with constant hydrogen to oil (H 2 /Oil) ratio. The effects of T, P, and LHSV on the conversion of sulfur, nitrogen, vanadium, nickel, and asphaltene were studied. The results showed that high T and P and low LHSV in HDS, HDN, HDV, HDNi, and HDAs of crude oil improve the sulfur (S), nitrogen (N), metals [vanadium (V) and nickel (Ni) ], and asphaltene (Asph) conversion. The hydrotreated crude oil has been distilled into the following fractions: light naphtha (LN), heavy naphtha (HN), heavy kerosene (HK), light gas oil (LGO), and reduced crude residue (RCR), to compare the yield of these fractions produced by distillation after the HDT process to those produced by conventional methods (i. e., HDT of each fraction separately after the distillation). The yield of the middle distillate showed greater yield compared to the middle distillate produced by conventional methods. The properties of RCR produced using both methods are also discussed...|$|R
30|$|A study (Lapham 2012) {{reported}} that the global oil reserves are estimated to contain 35 % light oil, 29 % medium <b>oil,</b> 26 % <b>heavy</b> <b>oil,</b> and 10 % extra <b>heavy</b> <b>oil.</b> Though the <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> reserve is potentially huge in the world, especially South America, the <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> recovery factor still remains low (Meyer et al. 2003). In addition, <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> in fractured carbonate reservoirs represents 25 %– 30 % of the total oil {{in place in the}} Middle East (Saidi 1988). The thermal EOR has a potential to enhance the <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> recovery. The Wafra oil field in Oman already shows the huge potential for thermal EOR in at least a portion of the field. Lapham evaluated the extensive EOR projects and concluded that hybrid thermal EOR combining with other EOR is efficient to recover the <b>heavy</b> <b>oil.</b> Therefore, thermal EOR with LSWI can be a promising hybrid EOR for <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> reservoirs. When this hybrid EOR technology is developed and secures practical feasibility, it will expand the <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> market. One of the great candidate thermal EORs for the hybrid EOR is hot water injection. It is a waterflood-based EOR similar to LSWI. The field tests and experiments already have confirmed that hot water injection reduces <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> viscosity and improves <b>heavy</b> <b>oil</b> production (Kovscek et al. 2000; Alajmi et al. 2009; Duval et al. 2015). Additionally, it potentially influences pore connectivity because of temperature-dependent mineral reactions (Kovscek et al. 2000). The geochemical reactions are known to be sensitive to both temperature and pressure (Appelo and Postma 2005), so hot water injection significantly affects geochemical reactions.|$|R
