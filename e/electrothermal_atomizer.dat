40|$|Here is {{reported}} novel instrumentation for atomic spectrometry that combined {{the use of}} a pulsed laser system as the light source and an <b>electrothermal</b> <b>atomizer</b> as the atom cell. The main goal of the research was to develop instrumentation that was more sensitive for elemental analysis than commercially available instruments and could be used to determine elements in real sample matrices. Laser excited atomic fluorescence spectrometry (LEAFS) in an <b>electrothermal</b> <b>atomizer</b> (ETA) was compared to ETA atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) for the determination of thallium, manganese, and lead in food and agricultural standard reference materials (SRMs). Compared to ETA AAS, ETA LEAFS has a longer linear dynamic range (LDR) (5 - 7 orders of magnitude compared to 2 - 3 orders of magnitude) and higher sensitivity (10 - 16 to 10 - 14 g as compared to 10 - 13 to 10 - 11 g). Consequently, ETA LEAFS allows elemental analysis to be done over a wider range of concentrations with less dilution steps. Thallium was accurately determined in biological samples by ETA LEAFS at amounts five to one hundred times below the ETA AAS detection limit.

40|$|An atomic {{absorption}} spectrometer based on a quartz acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF) monochromator operating in the 271 - 453 nm range, is described. The instrument was tailored to study the formation and evolution of electrothermal atomic cloud induced either by one or two tungsten coils. The spectrometer also includes a fast response programmable photomultiplier module for data acquisition, and a power supply capable of driving two parallel tungsten coils independently.

40|$|This work {{shows the}} {{analytical}} possibilities of an <b>electrothermal</b> <b>atomizer</b> for the direct determination of trace metals in sea-water. The high background signals {{generated by the}} matrix perturb in particular volatile elements because of the low decomposition temperature allowed. In the case of cadmium, addition of ascorbic acid to the sample permits the modification of the atomization mechanism and {{the reduction of the}} optimum temperature. Under these conditions, absorption peak of the cadmium precedes the background absorption and consequently the analysis is no longer limited by the magnitude of the matrix signal: the determination of cadmium concentrations far below the μg- 1 level is easily possible. Although the direct determination of the other elements should be in principle less disturbed by the background, the analytical performance is poorer than for cadmium. Limits of determination of the order from 0. 1 to 1 μg- 1 can be reached for chromium, copper and manganese. Lead and nickel appeared to be the most difficult elements; their direct determination is only possible in polluted coastal or estuarine waters. The injection of the sample as an aerosol into hot graphite tube showed to be well adapted to this kind of investigations. The simultaneous visualization of specific and background signals allows interpretations which until now were impossible with commercially available apparatus. © 1982.

In the absence of concomitants, lead atomization efficiency was improved by the presence of H 2 (10 % v/v) in the purge gas composition, during pyrolysis and atomization steps.

40|$|Graphite filter <b>atomizers</b> (GFA) for <b>electrothermal</b> atomic {{absorption}} spectrometry (ETAAS) show substantial advantages over commonly employed <b>electrothermal</b> vaporizers and <b>atomizers,</b> tube and platform furnaces, for direct determination of high and medium volatility elements in matrices associated with strong spectral and chemical interferences. Two factors provide lower limits of detection and shorter determination cycles with the GFA: the vaporization area in the GFA is separated from the absorption volume by a porous graphite partition; the sample is distributed over a large surface of a collector in the vaporization area. These factors convert the GFA into an efficient chemical reactor. The research concerning the GFA concept, technique and analytical methodology, carried out mainly in the author's laboratory in Russia and South Africa, is reviewed.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{suggested}} for simulation of transient sample vapor composition and release rate during vaporization of analytes in <b>electrothermal</b> (ET) <b>atomizers</b> for AAS. The approach {{is based on}} the Langmuir theory of evaporation of metals {{in the presence of a}} gas at atmospheric pressure, which advocates formation of mass equilibrium in the boundary layer next to the evaporation surface. It is suggested in this work that in ET atomizers the release of atoms and molecules from the boundary layer next to the dry residue of the analyte is accompanied by spreading of the layer around the sample droplets or crystals. Thus, eventually, the vapor source forms an effective area associated with a monolayer of the analyte. In particular, for the case of a metal oxide analyte as discussed in the work, the boundary layer contains the species present in thermodynamic equilibrium with oxide, which are metal atoms and dimers, oxide molecules and oxygen. Because of an excess of Ar, the probability of mass and energy exchange between the evolved gaseous species is low, this substantiates independent mass transport of each type of species from the boundary layer and through absorption volume. Diffusion, capture by Ar flow and gas thermal expansion is considered to control vapor transport and release rate. Each specific flow is affected by secondary processes occurring in collisions of the evolved molecules and atoms with the walls of graphite tube. Diffusion of oxygen containing species out of the boundary layer is facilitated by annihilation of oxygen and reduction of oxide on the graphite surface, while interaction of metal vapor with graphite slows down transport of atomic vapor out of the atomizer. These assumptions are used as the basis for the presentation of the problem as a system of first order differential equations describing mass and temperature balance in the atomizer. Numerical solution of the system of equations provides the simulation of temporal composition of the sample constituents in condensed and gas phase in the atomizer according to chemical properties of the analyte and experimental conditions. The suggested approach avoids the description of atomization processes via kinetic parameters such as activation energy, frequency factor, surface coverage or reaction order...|$|R

A complete pre-concentration/elution cycle took 208 s, with 30 s sample load time (1. 7 mL) and 4 s elution time (71 µL).

40|$|Flow {{injection}} hydride generation {{atomic absorption}} spectrometry is the practice of derivatizing the analyte to the volatile hydride by flow injection and introducing it to the spectrometer in the gas phase. Although hydride generation is well developed, there are still aspects and nuances which require investigation to improve the understanding of this method of sample introduction. The suggestion that the addition of various surfactants to the reagents in the hydride forming reaction has beneficial effects has been investigated. Although, in previous reports, an increase in sensitivity had {{been reported in the}} presence of surfactants, such an improvement was not observed for the flow injection procedure used in the work described in this dissertation. ^ The effect of dissolved salts on the hydride forming reaction has been investigated. An increase in sensitivity in the presence of high concentrations of dissolved salts has been observed. This has been attributed to an increase in the proportion of the volatile hydride which is removed from the reagents in the on-line procedure. ^ In the hydride trapping procedure, the hydrides are trapped on the interior of an <b>electrothermal</b> <b>atomizer</b> prior to atomization. Although previous reports have indicated that one may improve the limit of detection simply by increasing sample size, a practical and theoretical investigation concluded that the relationship is not linear, and that the limit of detection is limited by impurities in the reagents. ^ Methods for the determination of lead by hydride generation with quartz tube and electrothermal atomization have been developed. The use of an oxidizing agent makes this method a little more complicated than for other elements. ^ The determination of total selenium in urine has been attempted using an on-line digestion procedure in which bromine is generated in-situ. Whilst this method has been demonstrated to be effective in an off-line procedure, the development of a method with on-line digestion was not successful. The use of an alternative oxidizing agent and energy supply mechanism would be appear to be necessary. ...|$|E
40|$|Chapter 1 reviews laser {{ablation}} in analytical atomic spectrometry. Laser ablation is categorized into two functions: one {{is used as}} a sample introduction method, the other function {{is used as a}} microprobe analysis method. Both fundamental and applicational aspects are reviewed with the citations of related papers. This chapter also serves as an introduction to the work which is described in chapter 2 and chapter 3 as {{laser ablation}} is a relatively new research area for the research group. ^ In chapter 2, instrumentation for excimer (308 nm) laser ablation of samples was coupled with a microwave induced plasma (MLP), and evaluated for its potential as an approach to solid sampling for atomic emission spectrometry. Operating parameters were optimized, and the effects of laser repetition rate and number of laser shots on the emission signal were investigated. The UV excimer laser removed more material than would be expected of an infrared laser of similar energy. The chromium detection limit in the solid steel sample was estimated to be about 500 μg/g. ^ In chapter 3, a wavelength tunable optical parametric oscillator (OPO) laser was used to ablate a steel sample into the same apparatus described in chapter 2. The emission signal for the elements was selectively enhanced when the ablation wavelength was tuned to be in resonance with any atomic transition of that element. This was the first report of the observation of resonant ablation by use of optical detection, as prior reports of resonant ablation have used mass spectrometric detectors. ^ Chapter 4 reviews the publications in laser excited atomic fluorescence spectrometry in recent eight years. The focus of the review is on recent development on new instruments and applications of this technique. ^ Chapter 5 studies the determination of tin in nickel-based alloys with laser excited atomic fluorescence in a graphite furnace. Zeeman <b>electrothermal</b> <b>atomizer</b> atomic absorption spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry methods were also used. The laser excited atomic fluorescence method turned out to be as accurate as the other techniques.
