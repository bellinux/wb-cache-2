40|$|BACKGROUND: The ras {{family of}} proto-oncogenes encodes for small GTPases that play {{critical}} roles in cell-cycle progression and cellular transformation. ERK 1 / 2 MAP kinases are major ras effectors. Tumors in chemically treated mouse skin contain mutations in the Ha-ras proto- oncogene. Amplification and mutation of Ha-ras {{has been shown}} to correlate with malignant progression of these tumors. Cell lines isolated from mouse skin tumors represent the stages of tumor development, such as the PDV:PDVC 57 cell line pair and B 9 squamous carcinoma and A 5 spindle cells. PDVC 57 cells were selected from PDV cells, which were transformed with <b>dimethyl-benzanthracene</b> (DMBA) in vitro and then transplanted in adult syngeneic mice. The PDV:PDVC 57 pair contains ratio of normal:mutant Ha-ras 2 : 1 and 1 : 2, respectively. This genetic alteration correlates with more advanced tumorigenic characteristics of PDVC 57 compared to PDV. The squamous carcinoma B 9 cell clone was isolated from the same primary tumor as A 5 spindle cell line. The mutant Ha-ras allele, also present in B 9, is amplified and overexpressed in A 5 cells. Therefore these cell line pairs represent an in vivo model for studies of Ha-ras and ERK 1 / 2 signaling in mouse tumorigenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ERK 1 / 2 status in the above mouse cell lines was examined by using various molecular techniques. For the study of the tumorigenic properties {{and the role of the}} ras/MEK/ERK 1 / 2 pathway in the cell lines mentioned, phenotypic characteristics, colony formation assay, anchorage-independent growth, and gelatin zymography were assessed, after or without treatment with the MEK inhibitor, PD 98059. RESULTS: ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation was found to be increased in PDVC 57 when compared to PDV. This also applies to A 5 spindle carcinoma cells when compared to squamous carcinoma and papilloma cells. The above finding was reproduced when transfecting human activated Ha-ras allele into PDV, thus demonstrating that Ha-ras enhances ERK 1 / 2 signaling. To further test whether ERK 1 / 2 activation was required for growth we used the MEK- 1 inhibitor, PD 98059. The latter inhibited cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of squamous and spindle cells. In addition, PD 98059 treatment partially reverted the spindle morphology of A 5 cells. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest, for the first time, that oncogenicity and the degree of progression in the mouse skin carcinogenesis model correlates with ERK 1 / 2 signaling...|$|E
