40|$|The primary {{objectives}} of the Mars Exploration program are to collect data for planetary science in a quest to answer questions related to Origins, to search for evidence of extinct and extant life, and to expand the human presence in the solar system. The public and political engagement that is critical for support of a Mars exploration program is based {{on all of these}} objectives. In order to retain and to build public and political support, it is important for NASA to have an integrated Mars <b>exploration</b> <b>plan,</b> not separate robotic and human plans that exist in parallel or in sequence. The resolution stemming from the current architectural review and prioritization of payloads may be pivotal in determining whether NASA will have such a unified plan and retain public support. There are several potential scientific and technological links between the robotic-only missions that have been flown and planned to date, and the robotic + human missions that will come in the future. Taking advantage of and leveraging those links are central {{to the idea of a}} unified Mars <b>exploration</b> <b>plan.</b> One such link is in situ resource utilization (ISRU) as an enabling technology to provide consumables such as fuels, oxygen, sweep and utility gases from the Mars atmosphere. ISRU for propellant production and for generation of life support consumables is a key element of human exploration mission plans because of the tremendous savings that can be realized in terms of launch costs and reduction in overall risk to the mission. The Human Exploration and Development of Space (HEDS) Enterprise has supported ISRU technology development for several years, and is funding the MIP and PROMISE payloads that will serve as the first demonstrations of ISRU technology for Mars. In our discussion and presentation at the workshop, we will highlight how the PROMISE ISRU experiment that has been selected by HEDS for a future Mars flight opportunity can extend and enhance the science experiments on board...|$|E

30|$|A {{major part}} of results that {{addressed}} the uncertainties are MDP and its variants modeling-based approaches. Typical results included and emphasized on sequential decision-making [8] and coordination [9, 10] under uncertainties. The problem of sequential decision-making under uncertainties for each robot was formulated as a MDP [8]. A decentralized model learning scheme based on the Incremental Feature Dependency Discovery (Dec-iFDD) was presented to learn uncertain state transition model in the underlying MDP. The scheme shared the most relevant features across teammates under limited communication. Moreover, a macro-action decentralized partially observable MDP (MacDec-POMDP)-based method for multi-robot coordination {{was introduced in the}} presence of uncertain sensing and other limitations [9]. A new planning algorithm which was called MacDec-POMDP heuristic search was presented. To overcome the issue of information space scales exponentially with the number of robots, the multi-robot POMDP was decentralized by POMDP policy auctions [10]. Moreover, a problem of assigning a set of stationary targets to a team of mobile robots under temporal, performance, perception, and resource constraints was addressed [11]. The corresponding constrained MDP was solved in two steps. Another related work is <b>exploration</b> <b>plan</b> based on stochastic dynamic programming [15] in which uncertainties in both sensing and control were taken into account. However, it is hard to solve MDP and its variants.|$|E
40|$|In {{the frame}} of an {{environmental}} reorganisation plan of an old landfill site (northern Sardinia, Italy), an integrated geophysical survey was carried out to delineate the landfill borders, to determine the nature and physical characteristics of the host materials with special emphasis on outlining {{the distribution of the}} leachate and biogas, and to define the pattern of the bedrock. Landfills are amenable to geophysical investigations because they usually contain waste materials characterised by high electrical conductivities, high magnetic susceptibility, and low seismic velocities. Moreover, the relatively high resistivity values of the bedrock allow to delineate the landfill boundaries. Due to the complexity of the phenomena linked to waste disposals, a multi-methodological geophysical approach (Cossu et al., 1997, 2001; Green et al., 1999; De Iaco et al., 2000) proved to be the best procedure and probably the only one capable of giving a highly meaningful answer to the general characterisation of a waste body. It is worth stressing that when a multidisciplinary strategy is used, the ambiguities inherent in each method are greatly reduced. In particular, in the cited area a very detailed exploration was carried out with several geophysical techniques: frequency and time domain electromagnetism, very low frequency, geoelectrical and induced polarisation tomography, seismic refraction and tomography. An integrated analysis of the data from the entire <b>exploration</b> <b>plan</b> provided a very accurate physical an...|$|E

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012, amended the Clean Air Act to transfer regulatory authority for air emissions on the outer continental shelf (OCS) off Alaska's north coast, including the Chukchi and Beaufort seas, from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to the Department of the Interior. Since the act was passed on December 23, 2011, there has been limited activity subject to air emission regulations or permitting on the OCS off Alaska's north coast, according to officials at the EPA and Interior. EPA officials stated that, before the act was passed, EPA had issued to Shell Gulf of Mexico Inc. and Shell Offshore, Inc., collectively, three air emission permits for drilling and other activities on the OCS off Alaska's north coast. Interior's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) is responsible for reviewing and approving plans for exploration, development, and production activities; this process includes projections of air emissions. According to a BOEM official, after the act passed, Shell conducted exploratory drilling on the OCS off Alaska's north coast in 2012, but it did so under its existing air emissions permits from EPA. Ancillary activities, such as surveys of the seafloor, have also been conducted. On November 6, 2013, Shell requested that its EPA permits be terminated.

40|$|Labor {{market survey}} (LMS) {{as used in}} {{rehabilitation}} and dis-ability services {{has been defined as}} “a survey methods strategy to collect qualitative and/or quantitative data for a small popu-lation census or sample about an identified labor market in order to draw inferences to the client/evaluee (N = 1) ” (Bar-ros-Bailey, 2011, in press). There are generally three phases in the rehabilitation counseling process where LMS is used— vocational <b>exploration,</b> <b>plan</b> development, and job placement. In vocational exploration and plan development, inferences from LMSs might be distal from the client and involve exam-ining a variety of potential occupations and their relevant labor market factors important to establishing a vocational goal and developing a rehabilitation plan and justification. In this instance, the inference is how the occupation(s) or job classification meet(s) an assessment of the needs, skills, and/ or interests of the individual. The intended outcome at these phases is typically a plan. For the job placement phase, the LMS information may be used more for establishing relation-ships with employers or identifying job opportunities within the labor market. For this phase, the immediate inference is very proximal to the client; that is, the information is used in the direct match between the abilities of a single individual and the work activities, requirements, and demands of a single or small pool of available positions. The intended outcome at this phase is placement and integration of an individual with a disability into the world of work. It has been established by Neulicht, Gann, Berg, and Taylor (2007) and confirmed by Barros-Bailey (2011, in press) that there exists little in the lit-erature on the use and practice of LMS in rehabilitation and disability services; thus, LMS may arguably depict a profes-sional area of rehabilitation counseling that is mainly carried forth by oral tradition in education, training, and practice...|$|E
