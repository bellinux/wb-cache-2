40|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} features of the international refugee regime as it has evolved over the last quarter century is the proliferation of labels. Rather than simply assessing the circumstances of applicants against the Convention refugee definition, the governments of most developed states have instead invented a seemingly endless list of alternative statuses - 2 ̆ 2 B 2 ̆ 2 status, <b>humanitarian</b> <b>admission,</b> temporary protected status, special leave to remain, Duldung, and the like. Persons assigned one of these labels have generally been protected against refoulement in line with Article 33 of the Refugee Convention. But in a variety of other ways, they have not been treated as refugees. They have, in particular, faced limits on freedom of movement, the ability to earn a livelihood, and access to education and general social support systems. Most critically, there has been a near-universal association of alter-native status with non-permanent presence. While refugees are by and large granted 2 ̆ 2 asylum 2 ̆ 2 - understood to entail an enduring right to remain in, or to be enfranchised by, the host country - the beneficiaries of alternative forms of protection have usually been admitted instead to what is commonly called 2 ̆ 2 temporary 2 ̆ 2 protection. That is, they are not granted an indefinite right to remain, but are instead allowed to stay in the host state {{for the duration of the}} risk in their country of origin...|$|E
40|$|Immigration {{reform was}} an active {{legislative}} issue in the first session of the 113 th Congress. The Senate passed the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act (S. 744), a comprehensive immigration reform bill that includes provisions on border security, interior enforcement, employment eligibility verification and worksite enforcement, legalization of unauthorized aliens, immigrant visas, nonimmigrant visas, and <b>humanitarian</b> <b>admissions.</b> For its part, the House took {{a different approach to}} immigration reform. Rather than considering a single comprehensive bill, the House acted on a set of immigration bills that address border security, interior enforcement, employment eligibility verification and worksite enforcement, and nonimmigrant and immigrant visas. House committees reported or ordered to be reported the following immigration bills: Border Security Results Act of 2013 (H. R. 1417); Strengthen and Fortify Enforcement (SAFE) Act (H. R. 2278); Legal Workforce Act (H. R. 1772); Agricultural Guestworker (AG) Act (H. R. 1773); and Supplying Knowledge-based Immigrants and Lifting Levels of STEM Visas (SKILLS Visa) Act (H. R. 2131). This report discusses these and other immigration-related issues that received legislative action or have been of significant congressional interest in the 113 th Congress...|$|R
30|$|The United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees (UNHCR) {{does not}} discern between refugees, {{stateless}} people and economic migrants. Both mass movements to Europe and within Central and South-East Asia consist of complex, mixed migratory movements. Despite the intricacy, the UNHCR speaks about a global refugee crisis in need for coherent management and demanded global action {{to deal with}} the greatest flight of humanity since the Second World War. 3 Also political leaders demanded global action. At a UN Conference in Washington on invitation US President Barrack Obama and a participation of 52 governments in late 2016, Co-host German Foreign Minister Frank- Walter Steinmeier stated that the world needed a “global management of migration”. In accordance, the the G 20 has turned its attention to the refugee crisis. In a statement the G 20 said a “coordinated and comprehensive” response is needed to surmount the crisis. Demanding an international response and burden sharing of the crisis, the G 20 Communique demands collective action on refuge settlement and <b>admission,</b> <b>humanitarian</b> aid and access for refugees to services, education and livelihood opportunities.|$|R
