40|$|The {{inclusion}} of linear <b>deterministic</b> <b>effects</b> {{in a time}} series model is important to get an appropriate specification. Such effects {{may be due to}} calendar variation, outlying observations or interventions. This article proposes a two-step method for estimating an adjusted time series and the parameters of its linear <b>deterministic</b> <b>effects</b> simultaneously. Although the main goal when applying this method in practice might only be to estimate the adjusted series, an important by-product is a substantial increase in efficiency in the estimates of the <b>deterministic</b> <b>effects.</b> Some theoretical examples are presented to demonstrate the intuitive appeal of this proposal. Then the methodology is applied on two real datasets. One of these applications investigates the importance of the 1995 economic crisis on Mexico's industrial production index. <b>Deterministic</b> <b>effects,</b> intervention analysis, minimum mean square error, precision share,...|$|R

Standard disciplinary accounts often attribute to Semple a prevailing interest in environmental determinism, a theory that the physical environment, rather than social conditions, determines culture; however her later work emphasized environmental influences as opposed to the environment's <b>deterministic</b> <b>effect</b> on culture, reflecting broader academic discontent with environmental determinism after the First World War.|$|E
50|$|This method {{may produce}} a {{sufficiently}} uniform distribution of hash values, {{as long as}} the hash range size n is small compared to the range of the checksum or fingerprint function. However, some checksums fare poorly in the avalanche test, which may be a concern in some applications. In particular, the popular CRC32 checksum provides only 16 bits (the higher half of the result) that are usable for hashing. Moreover, each bit of the input has a <b>deterministic</b> <b>effect</b> on each bit of the CRC32, that is one can tell without looking at the rest of the input, which bits of the output will flip if the input bit is flipped; so care must be taken to use all 32 bits when computing the hash from the checksum.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the second}} half of Learning to Labour, Willis synthesizes his {{observations}} of the lads' counter-school culture at Hammertown Boys in order to produce a theory of social reproduction that integrates culture as a key element alongside education. He proposes that the working-class lads enter working-class jobs of their own apparent volition, but this is not to be understood as merely a psychological inclination toward these jobs, nor as merely the <b>deterministic</b> <b>effect</b> of capitalist ideology persuading them to select them. Rather, it is in school that the lads acquire a distorted class consciousness through their counter-school culture, in which they end up embracing working-class, manual labor as more affirming and authentic. A rebellious culture can successfully oppose the norms of capitalism transmitted in school, but the success is, in Willis's terms, a [...] "pyrrhic victory," [...] for they end up taking on working-class jobs as adults.|$|E

50|$|Chronic {{radiation}} syndrome is {{a constellation of}} health effects that occur after months or years of chronic exposure to high amounts of ionizing radiation. Chronic {{radiation syndrome}} develops with a speed and severity proportional to the radiation dose received, i.e., it is a <b>deterministic</b> <b>effect</b> of radiation exposure, unlike radiation-induced cancer. It is distinct from acute radiation syndrome in that it occurs at dose rates low enough to permit natural repair mechanisms {{to compete with the}} radiation damage during the exposure period. Dose rates high enough to cause the acute form (> ~0.1 Gy/h) are fatal long before onset of the chronic form. The lower threshold for chronic radiation syndrome is between 0.7 and 1.5 Gy, at dose rates above 0.1 Gy/yr. This condition is primarily known from the Kyshtym disaster, where 66 cases were diagnosed, and has received little mention in Western literature. A future ICRP publication, currently in draft, may recognize the condition but with higher thresholds.|$|E
5000|$|Amongst the {{building}} blocks of a GPS Time and Frequency solution the oscillator is a key component and typically they are built around an Oven Controlled Crystal Oscillator (OCXO) or a Rubidium based clock. The dominant factors influencing the quality of the reference oscillator are taken to be aging and temperature stability. However, depending upon the construction of the oscillator, barometric pressure and relative humidity can have at least as strong an influence on the stability of the quartz oscillator. What {{is often referred to as}} [...] "random walk" [...] instability is actually a <b>deterministic</b> <b>effect</b> of environmental parameters. These can be measured and modeled to vastly improve the performance of quartz oscillators. An addition of a Microprocessor to the reference oscillator can improve temperature stability and aging performance During Holdover any remaining clock error caused by aging and temperature instability can be corrected by control mechanisms. A combination of quartz based reference oscillator (such as an OCXO) and modern correction algorithms can get good results in Holdover applications.|$|E
