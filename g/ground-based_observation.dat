50|$|The main {{limitation}} in use {{was that}} Chain Home was a fixed system, non-rotational, which meant {{it could not}} see beyond its sixty-degree transmission arc or behind it once the targets had flown overhead, and so raid plotting over land was down to ground observers, principally the Observer Corps (from April 1941 known as the Royal Observer Corps). <b>Ground-based</b> <b>observation</b> was acceptable during the day but useless at night and in conditions of reduced visibility. This problem was reduced on introduction of more advanced surveillance radars with 360-degree tracking and height-finding capability and, more important, aircraft fitted with Airborne Intercept radar (AI), which had been developed in parallel with Chain Home from 1936 onwards.

50|$|When {{applied to}} the Sun, this science is called {{helioseismology}} and has been ongoing for a few decades by now. The solar surface helium abundance was derived very accurately for the first time, which has definitely shown the importance of microscopic diffusion in the solar structure. Helioseismology analyses have also unveiled the solar internal rotational profile, the precise extent of the convective envelope {{and the location of}} the helium ionization zone. Despite enormous technical challenges, it was thus tempting to apply similar analyses to stars. From the ground this was only possible for stars close to the Sun such as α Centauri, Procyon, β Virginis... The goal is to detect extremely small light variations (down to 1 ppm) and to extract the frequencies responsible for these brightness fluctuations. This produces a frequency spectrum typical of the star under scrutiny. Oscillation periods vary from a few minutes to several hours depending of the type of star and its evolutionary state. To reach such performances, long observing times devoid of day/night alternations are required. Space is thus the ideal asteroseismic laboratory. By revealing their microvariability, measuring their oscillations at the ppm level, CoRoT has provided a new vision of stars, never reached before by any <b>ground-based</b> <b>observation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Tawhaki Patera is one {{of several}} volcanoes {{suspected}} of being responsible for the August 2, 1999 9908A outburst eruption, one of the most energetic observed on Io. [...] However, the low-resolution of the <b>ground-based</b> <b>observation</b> precludes a definitive identification of the source volcano of the eruption beyond that it was located in northwestern Media Regio on Io's leading hemisphere. [...] The NIMS instrument did detect a thermal hotspot between one and five micrometres at Tawhaki during Galileo's 21st orbit in July 1999, a month prior to the eruption. [...] The southern half of Tawhaki Patera was observed by Galileo at 260 meters per pixel during an encounter with Io on November 26, 1999, providing the highest resolution image of this volcano. [...] This along with a color observation taken in July 1999, showed that the floor of Tawhaki contained some of the darkest material in the area, suggesting the cooled lava at Tawhaki is very young, consistent with the activity seen during the Galileo mission. [...] A lava channel, later named Tawhaki Vallis was also found to the southeast. The channel maybe related to earlier activity at Tawhaki Patera, but the images of the region cut off the northern half of the volcano and channel, preventing a relationship between the two volcanic features to be established. [...] In August 2001, NIMS once again observed a low level of activity at Tawhaki Patera.|$|E
40|$|Space-borne low-to medium-resolution (R 10 ^ 2 - 10 ^ 3) {{transmission}} spectroscopy of atmospheres {{detect the}} broadest spectral features (alkali doublets, molecular bands, scattering), while high-resolution (R 10 ^ 5), <b>ground-based</b> <b>observations</b> probe the sharpest features (cores of the alkali lines, molecular lines). The two techniques differ by:(1) The LSF of <b>ground-based</b> <b>observations</b> is 10 ^ 3 times narrower than for space-borne observations;(2) Space-borne transmission spectra probe {{up to the}} base of thermosphere, while <b>ground-based</b> <b>observations</b> can reach pressures down to 10 ^- 11;(3) Space-borne observations directly yield the transit depth of the planet, while <b>ground-based</b> <b>observations</b> measure differences in the radius of the planet at different wavelengths. It is challenging to combine both techniques. We develop a method to compare theoretical models with observations at different resolutions. We introduce PyETA, a line-by-line 1 D radiative transfer code to compute transmission spectra at R 10 ^ 6 (0. 01 A) over a broad wavelength range. An hybrid forward modeling/retrieval optimization scheme is devised to deal with the large computational resources required by modeling a broad wavelength range (0. 3 - 2 μ m) at high resolution. We apply our technique to HD 189733 b. Here, HST observations reveal a flattened spectrum due to scattering by aerosols, while high-resolution <b>ground-based</b> HARPS <b>observations</b> reveal the sharp cores of sodium lines. We reconcile these results by building models that reproduce simultaneously both data sets, from the troposphere to the thermosphere. We confirm:(1) the presence of scattering by tropospheric aerosols;(2) that the sodium core feature is of thermospheric origin. Accounting for aerosols, the sodium cores indicate T up to 10000 K in the thermosphere. The precise value of the thermospheric temperature is degenerate with the abundance of sodium and altitude of the aerosol deck.
