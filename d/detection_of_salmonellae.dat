This FA method combines a rapid cultural phase and a serological phase {{that allow for}} propagation of salmonellae in a minimum time, employing the industrial 8 -hr work day as a guide. Two hundred fifty naturally contaminated human food and animal feed samples, representing 647 trials, were tested by the FA method. A total of 18 different food and feed samples was used. The method used by the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) for the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>salmonellae</b> was the control method.

40|$|Direct {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} (PCR) -based detection with fecal specimens is hampered by inhibitory compounds, such as bilirubin and bile salts. These fecal compounds showed significant inhibition of PCR at low concentrations (10 to 50 micrograms/ml). For direct PCR analysis, fecal samples must be diluted 500 -fold to overcome inhibition. Therefore, the magnetic immuno PCR assay (MIPA), which combines immunomagnetic separation by using specific monoclonal antibodies and PCR, was used to directly detect salmonellae in feces from humans. Immunomagnetically extracted stool samples needed to be diluted only 10 -fold when 1 microgram of T 4 gene 32 protein {{was added to the}} PCR. The MIPA sensitivity obtained was 10 (5) CFU/ml of feces. A panel of monoclonal antibodies specific for Salmonella serogroups A to E was used to extract salmonellae from clinical samples. MIPA <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>salmonellae</b> occurred with 11 out of 14 stool samples stored at 4 degrees C for 2 months.

40|$|The European National Reference Laboratories (NRLs) for Salmonella {{were able}} to detect high and low levels <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> in a ring trial using minced beef as matrix, thereby {{reaching}} the level of good performance. The Modified Semi-solid Rappaport Vassiliadis (MSRV), a method often used for the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> in animal faeces, {{turned out to be}} the best method for minced beef. This was one outcome of the inter-laboratory comparison study organized by the Community Reference Laboratory (CRL) for <b>Salmonella</b> on the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> spp. in a food matrix in September 2006. The first, and most important goal, was to see if the 25 participating laboratories in this study could detect Salmonella in minced beef. The second goal was to compare the different analysis methods for the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> in minced beef. Each laboratory received a package containing minced beef and 35 gelatin capsules containing different levels <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella.</b> According to the instructions, the laboratories spiked the meat with the capsules and tested those samples for the presence <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella.</b> The laboratories used three methods for running this test: Rappaport Vassiliadis Soya broth (RVS), Mueller Kauffmann Tetrathionate novobiocin broth (MKTTn) and Modified Semi-solid Rappaport Vassiliadis (MSRV). The first two methods are internationally prescribed for the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> in food, while the third (MSRV) is prescribed for the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> in veterinary faeces. All laboratories found Salmonella in just 88 % of the samples using one of the food methods (MKTTn).

40|$|Radioimmunometric and enzyme-immunometric assays were {{developed}} for the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>salmonellae</b> in pure and mixed cultures {{as well as in}} 59 food samples. The performances of titanous hydroxide suspension and microtiter plates as the solid phase for the immobilization of microorganisms were compared in these immunoassays. Detection of populations of salmonella cells in pure culture, diluted with saline, was 4 - to 10 -fold more sensitive with the microtiter plates. However, with mixed culture of salmonella and other enterobacterial species, the detection sensitivity with titanous hydroxide was 100 - to 160 -fold more sensitive than with microtiter plates. Good correlation existed between results of a standard cultural method for the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>salmonellae</b> in foods and those obtained from radioimmunometric and enzyme-immunometric assays utilizing titanous hydroxide. However, a high incidence of false-positive and false-negative results with food samples occurred with the enzyme-immunometric assay utilizing microtiter plates.

40|$|Salmonella Typhimurium {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{pathogens}} compromising porcine and human health as well as food safety, because it is a pre-vailing source of foodborne infections due to contaminated pork. A prominent problem in the management of this bacteriosis is the number of subclinically infected carrier pigs. As very little is known concerning the mechanisms allowing Salmonella to persist in pigs, the objective of this study was to develop an immunohistochem-ical approach for the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>salmonellae</b> in tissue of pigs experimentally infected with Salmonella Typhimurium. Samples were obtained from a challenge trial in which piglets of the German Landrace were intragastrically infected with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium DT 104 (1. 4 - 2. 1 ¥ 1010 CFU). Piglets were sacrificed on days 2 and 28 post infection. Tissue samples of jejunum, ileum, colon, ileoce-cal mesenteric lymph nodes (Lnn. ileocolici), and tonsils (Tonsilla veli palatini) were fixed in Zamboni’s fixative and paraffin-embedded. Different immunohistochemical staining proto-cols were evaluated. Salmonella was detected in varying amounts in the tissues. Brown iron-con-taining pigments in the lymph nodes interfered with the identification of Salmonella if DAB was used as a staining reagent. Detergents like Triton X- 100 or Saponin enhanced the sensitivi-ty.

CAS medium was then compared prospectively to XLD and SS for the detection and presumptive identification of Salmonella strains in 500 consecutive clinical stool samples. All stock Salmonella isolates produced typical mauve colonies on CAS medium. Nine Salmonella strains were isolated from clinical specimens. The sensitivities for the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>salmonellae</b> after primary plating on CAS medium and the combination of XLD and SS after enrichment were 100 %. The specificity for the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>salmonellae</b> after primary plating on CAS medium (83 %) was significantly (P < 0. 0001) higher than that after primary plating on the combination of SS and XLD media (55 %) (a 28 % difference in rates; 95 % confidence interval, 23. 0 to 34 %). Twenty-nine non-Salmonella organisms produced mauve colonies on CAS medium, including 17 Candida spp. (59 %) and 8 Pseudomonas spp. (28 %). These were easily excluded as salmonellae by colony morphology, microscopic examination of a wet preparation, or oxidase testing. One biochemically inert Escherichia coli isolate required further identification to differentiate it from Salmonella spp. The use of plating on CAS medium demonstrated high levels of sensitivity and specificity and reduced the time to final identification of Salmonella spp., resulting in substantial cost savings. It can be recommended for use for the primary isolation of Salmonella spp. from stool specimens. Other media (e. g., XLD) are required to detect Shigella spp. concurrently...|$|E

All seven water samples that contained salmonellae of serogroups B or C 2, including three that were culture positive only after delayed secondary enrichment, were ELISA positive. Seven of the nine water samples that contained salmonellae of other serogroups, and all 38 culture-negative samples, were ELISA negative. The ELISA was simple to perform, produced results in 48 h, and was more economical than culture methods...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Avian {{salmonellosis}} due to Salmonella B and D serogroups has a {{great importance}} because of its public health and economical impact in poultry industry. Serological diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> infection currently relies on laboratory-based ELISA for <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> antibodies against most predominant Salmonella serotypes. The present {{study was conducted to}} prepare sonicated polyvalent Salmonella antigen (group B and D) from local isolates. ELISA procedure was developed for the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> infection in experimentally infected chickens. For ELISA validation, the efficacy test accomplished by reaction with known positive and negative serum. The results revealed that, relative sensitivity and specificity of ELISA using the polyvalent sonicated Salmonella antigen with chicken cloacae samples compared to bacteriological diagnosis were 100 and 55. 5 %, respectively. The data indicated that the polyvalent Salmonella antigen isn't suitable for clinical testing and <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> infection among poultry by ELISA as it showed a very low level of specificity...|$|R

Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) is one <b>of</b> the non-typhoid <b>Salmonellae</b> that can be transmitted to human from poultry products, water, and contaminated food. In recent years, new and rapid detection methods such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been developed. In this study, recombinant FliC (rFliC) was produced {{to be used as}} an antigen. The immunization was conducted in mice with the purified recombinant FliC (rFliC). The mice were subcutaneously immunized with rFliC and elicited significant rFliC specific serum IgG antibodies. An indirect ELISA system was established for the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> Enteritidis. Our results confirmed that the recombinant flagellin {{can be one of the}} excellent indicators for the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> Enteritidis...|$|R
40|$|Current {{methods for}} <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> spp. and Listeria monocytogenes in food are culture-based methods and require {{performing}} numerous steps, between preenrichment, enrichment, selective plating, identification, and confirmation. Conducting these procedures can take several days; they require extensive manual labor and {{large amounts of}} media and reagents which can increase {{the cost of the}} testing. Molecular-based rapid high throughput methods can present a valid alternative to these methods, allowing for timely and sensitive <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> these bacterial pathogens before the contaminated products can reach the consumer, helping to prevent the occurrence of foodborne listeriosis and salmonellosis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a sensitive and robust molecular method that uses sequence-specific rRNA-targeted fluorescently-labeled oligonucleotide probes to specifically label whole, permeabilized bacterial cells. When coupled with fluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry for analysis, FISH can be a powerful tool for <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> bacterial pathogens in food. My hypothesis was that we could develop rapid and sensitive FISH-based methods for <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> these two pathogens in complex food matrices. My research concentrated on four objectives: 1. Optimize use of existing FISH probes and hybridization conditions for <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> spp. and Listeria monocytogenes; 2. Develop pre-anayltical food sample preparation methods compatible with downstream approaches for whole-cell detection; 3. Utilize the results of objectives 1 and 2 to develop FISH-based assays for <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> spp. and L. monocytogenes in foods; and 4. Establish the ultimate <b>detection</b> sensitivity <b>of</b> the developed methods. Specifically, optimal combinations of existing Salmonella-specific probes were developed and applied for rapid (15 min) hybridizations of target cells. Use of these probe cocktails was integrated with pre-analytical sample preparation steps, including tangential flow filtration, adhesive tape sampling and immunomagnetic separation to enable sensitive <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> spp. in complex food systems via flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy. The food systems studied included alfalfa sprouts, fresh produce (tomatoes, jalapeyo peppers, spinach, cilantro), and peanut butter. Pre-analytical sample preparation using pulsification also improved the signal-to-noise ratio for cytometric <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> Listeria monocytogenes in pork frankfurters via flow cytometry following FISH. In addition, use of the PulsifierTM enabled detachment of surface-bound L. monocytogenes cells into minimal volumes of diluent, obviating the need for the subsequent cell concentration steps typically required prior to detection. Results from this work suggest that, when paired with effective methods for upstream food sample preparation and with downstream analytical methods such as flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy, FISH-based methods have great potential for rapid molecular <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Salmonella</b> spp. and L. monocytogenes in foods...|$|R
