25|$|In {{the absence}} of Rita and Charlie, Lofty was left to run the ED and began to {{struggle}} when disruptive patients were admitted. Since there was a staff shortage, Lofty hired agency nurse Diane Stuart (Catherine Skinner). When Lofty caught Diane sleeping on the job, she revealed {{she and her husband}} had recently separated, which Lofty sympathised with and so, gives her a second chance. Later, Lofty, Dylan and Diane are with a patient in a lift when the lift breaks down and the patient flatlines. As Lofty prepares to resuscitate, Diane fails to remove <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> the patient and is electrocuted, killing herself.|$|E
500|$|When {{the news}} of the {{imminent}} death sentence arrives, Zeenat is compelled to tell the truth to Meera. Meera is shocked beyond belief to hear Zeenat's words. The fact that her friendship was based on false pretenses is what hurts her more. She immediately refuses to sign the maafinama (statement of forgiveness). She makes it clear that she wants to hurt her husband's murderer, even if it was an accident, because of how much she is hurting in her new, veiled life. She leaves for the haveli. Zeenat, initially, is deeply hurt from Meera's decision but eventually accepts it as fate and decides to leave for her hometown. Meera later has a change of heart, perhaps because of her disillusionment at Randhir's willingness to [...] "sell" [...] her to Chopra. She gets encouragement from her paternal grandmother and hurries towards the railway station, where she meets Zeenat and gives her the signed statement of forgiveness. Zeenat extends <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> the train and Meera grabs it and climbs aboard, presumably running away from the only life she has ever known, as the train speeds up into the distance.|$|E
2500|$|Diane {{struggled}} {{from sleep}} loss and when Lofty catches her taking pills {{to keep her}} awake, he asks {{to discuss it with}} her in his office. Diane reveals her husband recently left her and her teenage daughter so Lofty offers her a second chance. Lofty, Diane and Dylan later became stuck in a lift and have to resuscitate a patient. Diane died when she failed to remove <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> the patient in time and electrocuted herself. Mead promised that [...] "a lot is going to unfold" [...] from the scenes and revealed that he [...] "welled up" [...] when he watched the episode.|$|E
60|$|She removed <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> {{face and}} looked at him stealthily.|$|R
60|$|She took <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> {{face and}} looked at him inquiringly.|$|R
60|$|Her face {{became quite}} hard. Slowly she took <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>from</b> his shoulders.|$|R
60|$|Allie got up, shyly {{and with}} {{difficulty}} disengaged <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> Neale's.|$|E
60|$|She withdrew <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> her dog {{and patted}} his for a moment.|$|E
60|$|The girl drew <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> his and {{straightened}} to her full height.|$|E
60|$|My wife {{looked at}} me and then slowly withdrew <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>from</b> my arm.|$|R
60|$|There came {{a sudden}} {{whiteness}} in her face, she plucked <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>from</b> mine.|$|R
60|$|He {{stared at}} her, and made {{as if to}} tear <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>from</b> their hold.|$|R
60|$|Columbine swept <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> {{her eyes}} with a gesture of utter surrender.|$|E
60|$|She {{snatched}} <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> his {{without a}} word, and rushed {{out of the}} shop.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he turned}} slowly toward her, thrust <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> around his neck, and stood up.|$|E
60|$|Still {{laughing}} and wondering, she removed <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>from</b> it, {{and he put}} it aside.|$|R
60|$|She dropped <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>from</b> before <b>her</b> face, {{and stood}} before him, pale and desperate.|$|R
60|$|She {{gazed into}} his eyes, and <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>from</b> merely lifeless things, became infused {{with a gentle}} warmth; they moved {{as if they might}} return the clasp in which they were held. But she did not speak, she simply looked at him, and he patiently waited. Suddenly she rose to her feet, {{withdrawing}} <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>from</b> his hold as if he had hurt her.|$|R
60|$|She moved <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> his {{shoulder}} and smiled, as if she derided him and his heat.|$|E
60|$|She withdrew <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> his {{somewhat}} too tenacious clasp. Something in {{his manner}} puzzled {{as well as}} irritated her.|$|E
60|$|She {{made a quick}} {{movement}} now, half withdrawing <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> his arm, but {{his firm}} grasp closed swiftly over it.|$|E
60|$|Then Charmion rose also {{and took}} <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> face, for she, too, had been {{stricken}} with dread.|$|R
60|$|She dropped <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> face, {{looking up}} at him, and there were tears shining in her {{beautiful}} eyes.|$|R

6000|$|... "'Oh, Mr. Macassar,' said Crinoline, {{dropping}} <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> his waistcoat, {{and looking}} bashfully towards the ground, 'what can you mean?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do they?--Don't {{you think}} it's nice of them?" [...] she said, gently {{removing}} <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> his. His eyes were shining with pleasure.|$|E
60|$|A short silence ensued. She withdrew <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> his arm. They stopped. Anthony {{looked as}} if a totally {{unexpected}} catastrophe had happened.|$|E
60|$|More {{agitated}} for {{a moment}} than I had ever seen her, she took <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>from</b> me, and moved a step back.|$|R
60|$|His eyes {{too were}} larger with tears. She wrested one of <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>from</b> his, and {{returned}} his action, pressing his tears away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I {{must ask}} him!" [...] she said, {{releasing}} <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>from</b> Lydgate's, and rising {{to stand at}} two yards' distance from him.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him no longer, and gently withdrew <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> his grasp. She {{understood}} that, indeed, he had answered her question.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why should I?" [...] said Kate, quietly drawing <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> him, [...] "for I have {{a devoted}} lover already--Master Martin Newcombe, of Barbadoes." ...|$|E
6000|$|Feemy dropped <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>from</b> Ussher's arm, but {{turning to}} the priest, she said, [...] "For heaven's sake take him away, Father John, he's drunk!" ...|$|E
60|$|She gazed {{a second}} {{at him in}} growing alarm, then she dragged <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>from</b> his grasp, and {{covering}} her face she fell a-sobbing.|$|R
60|$|She took <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>from</b> the desk; folded {{them in her}} lap; and sat looking {{towards the}} fire, with the impenetrability of an old Egyptian sculpture.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor you," [...] said Ethel, weeping {{but neither}} {{looking at him}} nor moving <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> lap where they lay helplessly. [...] "You don't understand." ...|$|R
