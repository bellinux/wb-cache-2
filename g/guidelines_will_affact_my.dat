Significant new {{research in the}} area of environmental noise and health has taken place since then. As well, new noise sources of concern for public health, such as personal electronic devices and wind turbines, were not addressed in previous guidelines. For these reasons, WHO is currently engaged in the revision of all pertinent literature and will provide recommendations for the protection of public health as part of new WHO Environmental Noise Guidelines for the European Region. The <b>guidelines</b> <b>will</b> focus on the WHO European Region and provide guidance to its Member States that is compatible with the noise indicators used in the European Union (EU) Directive on Environmental Noise. The process for updating the guidelines is complex, involving the work of top scientists from across the world under the coordination of WHO. The following health outcomes are deemed critical or very important and will be included: effects on sleep,annoyance, cognitive impairment, cardiovascular diseases, hearing impairment, tinnitus, adverse birth outcomes, and mental health and wellbeing. The <b>guidelines</b> <b>will</b> consider the evidence on health effects of environmental noise related to the various sources, for each outcome of relevance:, aircraft, rail, road and wind turbines. As well, specific settings such as residences, hospitals, learning establishments and public venues will be taken into account. Additionally, the <b>guidelines</b> <b>will</b> review the potential health benefits from noise mitigation and interventions to decrease noise levels. The <b>Guidelines</b> <b>will</b> provide up-to-date information on the health risks from environmental noise and evidence-based recommendations in order to support WHO Member States in their efforts to prevent and control exposure to excessive community nois...|$|R
