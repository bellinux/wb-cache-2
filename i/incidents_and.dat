40|$|A {{technique}} {{to resolve the}} <b>incident</b> <b>and</b> reflected waves from the records of composite waves is presented. It is applicable to both regular and irregular trains of waves. Two simultaneous wave records are taken at adjacent locations, and all the ampli-tudes of Fourier components are analyzed by the FFT technique. The amplitudes of <b>incident</b> <b>and</b> reflected wave components are estimated from the Fourier components, <b>and</b> the <b>incident</b> <b>and</b> reflected wave spectra are constructed by smoothing the estimated periodograms. The wave resolution is effective in the range outside {{the condition of the}} gauge spacing being even integer of half wavelength. The ratio of <b>incident</b> <b>and</b> reflected wave energies in the effective resolution range is employed in estimating the overall reflection coefficient. The <b>incident</b> <b>and</b> reflected wave heights are estimated from the composite wave heights by energy consideration...|$|R

Rob Bradford, United's managing director of customer solutions, telephoned Carroll to apologize for the <b>incident</b> <b>and</b> to ask for permission to use the video for internal training. United claimed that it [...] "hoped" [...] to learn from the <b>incident,</b> <b>and</b> to change its customer service policy accordingly.|$|R

5|$|The {{hurricane}} caused 41deaths and $2million in damages, all {{of which}} were in Texas. Strong waves caused several offshore shipping <b>incidents,</b> <b>and</b> storm surge inundated areas of the Texas coast, though damage in Galveston was mostly mitigated by the Galveston Seawall. In Velasco, only eight buildings remained intact after the hurricane. Strong winds forced train closures and destroyed and downed various infrastructure. Heavy rains further inland peaked at 8.5in (220mm) in Hallettsville.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Australia {{won their}} first two gold medals, the first time any {{southern}} hemisphere country had won an event. Australia's maiden gold came in highly unlikely circumstances. Steven Bradbury, {{a member of the}} bronze-winning 1994 relay team, won gold in short track speed skating on 17 February when all of his competitors in the 1,000m final crashed out on the final turn while jostling for the medal positions. He had qualified for the final after benefiting from similar <b>incidents</b> <b>and</b> disqualifications in the quarter and semifinals. Bradbury came third in his quarterfinal and would have been eliminated, but world champion Marc Gagnon was disqualified for obstruction and the Australian progressed.|$|E
5|$|On {{operations}} {{their performance}} was generally below par, but the Frenchmen {{were involved in}} some successful actions during February and early March 1978. Their oppressive treatment of the black villagers they encountered made them very unpopular in the operational area. The Rhodesians quickly deemed the experiment a failure and following a series of disasters for the company during {{the latter part of}} its second tour, including two friendly fire <b>incidents</b> <b>and</b> several fatalities, it was disbanded in May 1978. Forces led by one of its members, Bob Denard, later that month executed a coup d'état in the Comoros with French, Rhodesian and South African governmental support.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the first}} months of the Second World War Norwegian {{neutrality}} was violated repeatedly in the air and at sea by both warring parties, most dramatically with the 16 February Altmark Incident in Jøssingfjorden. This, along with other <b>incidents,</b> <b>and</b> the lack of a firm Norwegian response, led the warring parties to the impression that Norway could or would not effectively protect her neutrality. Initially the German view of Norwegian neutrality had been one of it being positive for the German war effort, allowing German merchant ships to transport cargo via Norwegian territorial waters without interference from the British.|$|E
5|$|The State Secretary and {{assistant}} to Vanhanen, Risto Volanen, said that attacks on schools {{could no longer}} be considered isolated <b>incidents,</b> <b>and</b> that police and security forces had to approach them with a new perspective in the aftermath of Kauhajoki. In December 2009, plans were announced to include an emergency SMS system in schools, more emergency exits, and better access to the architectural lay-out of school buildings for police. Each school is to undergo a risk assessment before the implementation of this plan.|$|E
5|$|The {{submarines}} {{have been}} the subject of many <b>incidents</b> <b>and</b> technical problems since the design phase, including accusations of foul play and bias during the design selection, improper handling of design changes during construction, major capability deficiencies in the first submarines, and ongoing technical problems throughout the early life of the class. These problems have been compounded by the inability of the RAN to retain sufficient personnel to operate the submarines—by 2008, only three could be manned, and between 2009 and 2012, on average two or fewer were fully operational. The resulting negative press has led to a poor public perception of the Collins class.|$|E

5|$|While {{maintenance}} {{issues and}} not the actual design of the aircraft were ultimately found responsible for the crash, the accident and subsequent grounding of all DC-10s by the Federal Aviation Administration added to an already unfavorable reputation of the DC-10 aircraft {{in the eyes of}} the public, caused by several other <b>incidents</b> <b>and</b> accidents involving the type. The investigation also revealed other DC-10s with damage caused by the same faulty maintenance procedure. The faulty procedure was banned, and the aircraft type went on to have a long career as a passenger and cargo aircraft. In response to this accident, American Airlines was fined $500,000 by the U.S. government for improper maintenance procedures.|$|E
5|$|Although sharks rarely bite humans, {{the tiger}} shark is {{reported}} to be responsible for a large percentage of fatal shark bite <b>incidents,</b> <b>and</b> is sometimes {{regarded as one of the}} most dangerous shark species. They often visit shallow reefs, harbors, and canals, creating the potential for encounter with humans. The tiger shark also dwells in river mouths and other runoff-rich water. While the tiger shark is considered to be one of the sharks most dangerous to humans, its bite rate is low. It is second on the list of number of recorded bites on humans, with the great white shark being first. On average, three to four shark bites occur per year in Hawaii, but they are rarely fatal. This bite rate is very low considering thousands of people swim, surf, and dive in Hawaiian waters every day. Human interactions with tiger sharks in Hawaiian waters have been shown to increase between September and November, when tiger shark females are believed to migrate to the islands to give birth.|$|E
5|$|Amelia {{affected}} the Texas coast {{for two days}} which caused several shipping <b>incidents</b> <b>and</b> minor damage in Corpus Christi and South Padre Island. While active, there were no deaths linked to the storm. However, the biggest impact from the storm followed its dissipation, when its remnants contributed to record rainfall totals over the state. The state, already suffering from a previous drought, believed that the rain would help alleviate the conditions. However, the dry ground aided the flooding from the storm. The rainfall caused several rivers and creeks to flood, especially around the Texas Hill Country and northern Texas, leading to severe damage. Following the storm, President Jimmy Carter declared six counties in the state as federal disaster areas, allowing residents to seek aid from the government. Additional aid was brought in {{from as far away}} as New York. Overall, Amelia caused 33fatalities with an estimated $110million in damages in what then-governor Dolph Briscoe called one of the worst floods in the history of the state.|$|E

5|$|As {{news about}} the arrest spread, there was {{violence}} {{in other parts of}} Maharashtra too. Sporadic incidents of stone pelting at municipal and private buses were reported in the reat of Maharashtra following the arrest of MNS chief Raj Thackeray in Ratnagiri. In Kothrud area, some alleged MNS activists damaged a company's bus that was taking its employees to workplace. Few Pune Municipal Transport (PMT) buses were stoned by miscreants, police said. Meanwhile, police have picked up around 100 MNS activists, including some corporators as a preventive measure. In Nashik, MNS activists set ablaze a truck near PWD minister Chhagan Bhujbal's farm and also damaged another truck at Vilholi-Phata area, police said. Incidents of stone pelting on MSRTC buses and other vehicles were reported in some areas, they said, adding vehicular traffic on the busy Mumbai-Agra-national highway was disrupted following the protest. Police rounded up 70 MNS activists in Nashik <b>incidents</b> <b>and</b> security was tightened in the city. In Solapur, incidents of stone pelting on state transport buses were also reported. In Nagpur MNS party leaders claimed to have damaged several MSRTC buses.|$|E
5|$|Ashley Smith (born 29 January 1988, New Brunswick, Canada) {{was adopted}} {{when she was}} 5 days old, and {{according}} to her adoptive parents, Coralee Smith and Herbert Gober, had a normal childhood in Moncton, New Brunswick. Between the ages of 13-14, her parents noted distinct behavioural changes in the child; by age 15 she had been before juvenile court 14 times for various minor offences such as throwing crabapples at a mailman, trespassing, and causing a disturbance. In March 2002, Smith was assessed by a psychologist who {{found no evidence of}} mental illness. However, her behavioural problems continued and she was suspended from school multiple times in the fall of 2002. In March 2003, after multiple court appearances, Smith was admitted to the Pierre Caissie Centre for assessment. She was diagnosed with ADHD, learning disorder, borderline personality disorder and narcissistic personality traits. She was discharged several days early from the Centre for unruly and disruptive behaviour and returned to the New Brunswick Youth Centre (NBYC). Smith was remanded to the NBYC multiple times over the next 3 years; during this time she was involved in more than 800 reported <b>incidents</b> <b>and</b> at least 150 attempts to physically harm herself.|$|E
5|$|At 12:50, a force {{comprising}} {{elements of}} the 121st and 125th Home Guard regiments and the 265th Reconnaissance-Sabotage Company managed to cross the Sava River at {{the confluence of the}} Sava and Una. The crossing force of 80 soldiers, encountered a minefield, VRS artillery fire and small arms fire from bunkers near the river bank. Extraction of the force began after 14:00, leading to an exchange of heavy artillery fire between the VRS on one bank and the 121st and the 125th Home Guard regiments' battlegroups on the other. The withdrawal required several river crossings using the available boats, and resulted in further losses. The situation was further complicated for the HV but a number of <b>incidents</b> <b>and</b> factors. These included a tugboat towing a damaged amphibious vehicle which caught fire because of faulty wiring, insufficient fire support from river gunboats, and boat crews provided by the 34th Engineer Battalion who refused to cross the river against VRS fire and had to be replaced by conscripts of the 33rd Engineer Battalion. Despite HV use of unmanned aerial vehicles to locate the VRS guns as targets for counter-battery fire, the artillery exchange continued late into the night of 19/20 September.|$|E
