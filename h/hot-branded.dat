University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2013 The {{presence}} of persistent organohalogen contaminants (OCs) in the habitats of Steller sea lions, Eumetopias jubatus, may influence reproductive rates and possibly survival. The lack of recovery and {{the reduction in}} natality for the western stock has no apparent cause and OCs may be potential contributing factors. Among the most common synthetic OCs measured in marine mammal tissues are polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and hexachlorobenzene (HCB). This project's focus was {{on the relationship between}} OCs and the western stock's lack of recovery. A suite of OCs were quantified from 239 <b>hot-branded</b> pups from 2001 - 2007 at nine Russian Far East rookeries. The use of brand-resighting data provided the opportunity to contrast pup survival, movement, reproductive success, and age at first reproduction between rookeries and among individuals with varying post-natal loads of OCs. Survival and movement were not affected by OC concentrations, but the estimated probability of survival within the first year was lower than expected at some rookeries. The effects of OCs on reproduction were less clear and no consistent pattern of negative effects emerged. Rookery specific differences indicated that location may be an important variable when considering survival, movement, and reproduction...|$|E
50|$|The term {{laser marking}} {{is also used}} as a generic term {{covering}} {{a broad spectrum of}} surfacing techniques including printing, <b>hot-branding</b> and laser bonding. The machines for laser engraving and laser marking are the same, so that the two terms are sometimes confused by those without knowledge or experience in the practice.|$|R

The laser power required here is often less than 10 watts depending on the laser being used as most are different. Hardwoods like walnut, mahogany and maple produce good results. Softwoods can be judiciously engraved but tend to vaporize at less-consistent depths. Burning a softwood with a fan blowing on it requires lowest power, quickest speed of cut, and enough airflow to extinguish what is trying meanwhile to ignite. Hard papers and fiberboard work well; linty papers and newsprint are like softwoods. Fur is not engraveable; finished leathers though can be laser-engraved with a look very similar to <b>hot-branding.</b> Certain latex rubber compounds can be laser engraved; for example these can be used to fabricate inking-stamps.|$|R
