50|$|Sessions then allowed Alito to {{give his}} opinion on the case {{involving}} the strip search of a ten-year-old girl (Doe v. Groody) that opponents had highlighted as showing what they viewed as Alito's extreme deference to authority (in this case {{the right of the}} police to interpret a search warrant for a suspected drug <b>dealer's</b> <b>premises</b> as authorizing them to strip-search the man's wife and daughter).|$|R
5000|$|In 1961, HSUS {{investigator}} Frank McMahon {{launched a}} probe of dog dealers {{around the country}} to generate support for a federal law to prevent cruelty to animals destined for use in laboratories. The five-year investigation into the multilayered trade in dogs paid off in February 1966 when Life published a photo-essay of a raid conducted on a Maryland dog <b>dealer’s</b> <b>premises</b> by McMahon and the state police. The Life spread sparked outrage, {{and tens of thousands of}} Americans wrote to their congressional representatives, demanding action to protect animals and prevent pet theft. That summer the U.S. Congress approved the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act (later renamed the [...] "Animal Welfare Act of 1966"), only the second major federal humane law passed since World War II.|$|R
50|$|A Thames Lighterman by trade, Chandler was {{sponsored}} during his early career from 1962 by entrant Tom Kirby a motorcycle <b>dealer</b> with <b>premises</b> at Roneo Corner, Hornchurch, Essex. Breaking {{his ties to}} Tom Kirby in 1964, Chandler was then sponsored by Reg Kirby, Tom's brother and a motorcycle dealer from Stanford-le-Hope, Essex, whose bikes were prepared by Colin Seeley's race shop, Colin Seeley Racing Developments.|$|R
2500|$|A strong {{community}} of living artists , and many <b>dealer</b> galleries have <b>premises</b> {{in the historic}} precinct. One of the town's principal living artists, Donna Demente, produces portraits and masks. At least partly through her work Oamaru hosts an annual mask festival each July, the [...] "Midwinter Masquerade". Another annual celebration, a Victorian Heritage fête, takes place in November.|$|R
50|$|Victoria Miro {{opened her}} first gallery in Cork Street, West London, in 1985, where she {{became one of}} the {{principal}} <b>dealers,</b> although the <b>premises</b> at 750 sq ft were little larger than a studio apartment. In the late 1980s, she opened a second gallery in Florence in Italy, but shut it in 1991 after the art market slump.|$|R
50|$|The {{dealership}} {{changed hands}} in 1947 to become Sydney V Golik and Co. Motor Car and Truck <b>Dealers.</b> The <b>premises</b> in Quay Street {{continued to be}} run as a motor show room, however an addition {{had been made to}} the rear of the building when a galvanised extension was constructed to act as a workshop and repair facility. Agricultural vehicles such as tractors and ploughs, were also displayed on the premises. At the time that the dealership changed hands a large electric advertising sign was fixed to the front of the building. A photograph from 1955 shows the building with an awning smaller than the present one affixed to the front of the building.|$|R
5000|$|The London Silver Vaults {{is a large}} {{subterranean}} {{market that}} opened as The Chancery Lane Safe Deposit on 7 May 1885. Originally renting out strong rooms to hold household silver, jewellery and documents, it transitioned to housing silver <b>dealers</b> in secure <b>premises</b> a few years later. It is located on Chancery Lane, London, WC2A 1QS. One vault was used to store a farthing, with the owner paying over [...] over the years for the vault.|$|R
40|$|The crabs Cancer pagurus (L) and Necora puber (L) are {{exported}} live, in bulk, {{from the}} UK to various continental countries. The {{success of this}} relatively new trade is marred by the incidence of mortalities and impaired quality of the delivered product. These studies addressed various causes - procedural and biological - of these events. Descriptions are given of detailed examinations of handling and other marketing protocols for both species from point of capture to arrival at continental <b>dealer's</b> <b>premises.</b> Such examinations were made {{with the help of}} a number of major dealers in the UK, Spain and France and included studies of handling, packing, holding and transportation methods, physical damage assessments before and after consignment, and chemical and biochemical analyses of seawater and blood samples. Dissolved ammonia levels were found to increase greatly in the fixed volume water of vivier tanks and this was found to be matched by correspondingly high blood ammonia values of the contained animals. The measurement of both free ammonia and ionic ammonia efflux rates of juvenile and adult Cpagurus and Npuber in media with high dissolved ammonia levels was investigated and was found to be related to concentration gradients between the internal and external media. The fluxes could be explained on the basis of diffusion down concentration gradients. When animals were transferred to media with higher ammonia levels than those in blood, a cessation of efflux, or even a net influx of ammonia (NH 4 +) occurred. During emersion, blood ammonia concentration rose. Such accumulated ammonia was very rapidly off loaded when the animals were re-immersed. The data produced has been discussed in the context of crustacean physiology and of improving the expectations of delivering a live, quality product after journeys of several days...|$|R
50|$|The Fine Art Society are art <b>dealers</b> {{with two}} <b>premises,</b> one in New Bond Street, London {{occupied}} since February 1876, {{and given a}} new entrance facade in 1881 by Edward William Godwin (1833-1886), and most recently fully refurbished in 2004-05, with a new gallery created for contemporary work. The other gallery is in Dundas Street in Edinburgh's New Town (originally Bourne Fine Art, established 1978). Founded in 1876 {{by a group of}} like-minded men led by William Longman of the publishing family, Marcus Bourne Huish (1843-1904), lawyer, editor, writer and collector, who became the first Managing Director {{while at the same time}} editing The Art Journal; and Archibald Stuart-Wortley MP. The gallery, first managed by Ernest Brown (later founder of Leicester Galleries) has for many years largely concentrated on British art and design from 1600 to the present day; with the Edinburgh premises specialising in Scottish art of the same period. The Edinburgh branch of the company is directed by Emily Walsh. The Chairmen were all drawn from the Longman family until the death of Mark Longman in 1972. Since then only Lord Macfarlane of Bearsden KT (until 1998), Sir Angus Grossart (until 2016) and Robin Holland-Martin (current) have held the position. Only seven people have held the position of Managing Director in the past 139 years, the present incumbent being Pippa Stockdale.|$|R
