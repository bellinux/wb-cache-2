40|$|Viscosity {{reduction}} of aqueous kaolin suspensions by conventional additives (deflocculation) is studied, using standard viscosity measurements. Apparent viscosity at 100 s- 1, and flow behavior index n give complex information about changes of viscosity and flow character of deflocculated suspensions. Several widely used <b>deflocculants</b> - electrolytes and polyelectrolytes - are {{tested in a}} wide range of concentrations. The optimum concentrations of these <b>deflocculants,</b> which result in minimum apparent viscosity of suspension, are found. Sedimentation stability of deflocculated suspensions is monitored. Inorganic electrolytes are found to be more effective in viscosity reduction. On the other hand, low-molecular-weight polyelectrolytes produce more stable final suspensions.

40|$|Suspensions of {{untreated}} {{and properly}} treated Na-exchanged kaolinite {{have been subjected}} to rheological investigations using sodium hexametaphosphate (NaHMP) or sodium disilicate (DIS) as <b>deflocculants.</b> The treatment of the clay consisted of a 24 h contact with solutions of NaHMP or DIS and separation of the resulting solid phase. This was then used to form the suspensions subjected to the rheological measurements. The results indicate that the dispersion ability of each <b>deflocculants</b> is remarkably influenced by the type of treatment. In particular, with respect to the untreated kaolinite, the efficiency of DIS is dramatically increased when the clay has been previously treated with a NaHMP solution. On the other hand, a decrease in the dispersant ability of NaHMP is observed from the untreated kaolinite to the one previously treated with DIS...|$|R

Three commercial <b>deflocculants</b> were used:a sodium salt of a benzenedisulfonic acid (Tiron), a sodium polyphosphate, and an aurintricarboxylic acid, triammonium salt (Aluminon). Calcium carbonate aqueous suspensions were prepared at various solid volume fractions (0. 270 to 0. 382).

It acts as a binder, helping the glaze adhere to the clay before it is fired, thereby minimising damage by handling during the manufacture of the piece.

For dispersing (emulsification) of oil into water (or water into oils), surfactants selected {{on the basis}} of Hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) number can be used.

40|$|When glaze {{compositions}} {{are prepared}} as aqueous suspensions, the frit is wet milled in an alumina ball mill with additives {{and water to}} obtain a glaze suspension with the appropriate rheological properties for subsequent application. Viscosity of the suspension is usually adjusted by adding <b>deflocculants,</b> binders and suspension agents. This paper examines the partial dissolution of Si, B, Ca, Mg, and Zn in glaze suspensions that contain a zirconium white frit, using two <b>deflocculants</b> (a sodium tripolyphosphate and a sodium polyacrylate), under different operating conditions (dry milling the frit in a jet mill and wet milling the frit in an alumina ball mill). Samples were taken at different times to study the ageing of the glaze suspension: the elements in the liquid fraction of the glaze suspension were analysed and a rheological study of the prepared suspensions was conducted. Partial dissolution of the frit was then related to the change in rheological properties. Viscosity was found to vary with time. Further tests were subsequently conducted in which a calcium salt was added to a sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) solution.

50|$|It is {{essential}} that large particles (> 150 μm for calcium carbonate and > 45 μm for quartz) should be eliminated from the rawmix, to facilitate chemical combination in the kiln. In the case of slurries, larger particles can be removed by hydrocyclones or sieving devices. These require {{a certain amount of}} energy, supplied by high pressure pumping. This process, and the moving and blending of the slurry, require careful control of the slurry viscosity. Clearly, a thinner slurry is easily obtained by adding more water, but at the expense of high energy consumption for its subsequent removal. In practice, the slurry is therefore made as thick as the plant equipment can handle. Cement rawmix slurries are Bingham plastics which can also exhibit thixotropic or rheopectic behaviour. The energy needed to pump slurry at a desired rate is controlled mainly by the slurry's yield stress, and this in turn varies more or less exponentially with the slurry solids/liquid ratio. In practice, <b>deflocculants</b> are often added in order to maintain pumpability at low moisture contents. Common <b>deflocculants</b> used (at typical dose rates of 0.005-0.03%) are sodium carbonate, sodium silicate, sodium polyphosphates and lignosulfonates. Under favourable circumstances, pumpable slurries with less than 25% water can be obtained.|$|R

50|$|Depending on the situation, {{polyelectrolytes}} {{can function}} as either flocculants or deflocculants. In order to stabilize emulsion, <b>deflocculant</b> polyelectrolytes are required. When repulsive forces between particles overcome the intermolecular forces in solution and the loose flocculated aggregates separate, deflocculation occurs. As {{opposed to the}} loose and easily separated sediments formed in flocculation, sediments formed in deflocculation are tightly packed and difficult to redisperse.The repelling forces in a deflocculation increase the zeta potential, which in turn reduces the viscosity of the suspension. Because of this reduction in viscosity, deflocculants are {{sometimes referred to as}} “thinning agents”. These thinning agents are usually alkaline and raise the pH of the suspension, preventing flocculation. Deflocculants are used as thinning agents in molding plastics, making glassware, and creating clay ceramics.|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} of an efficient <b>deflocculant,</b> sodium hexametaphosphate (NaHMP), with illite and montmorillonite samples of different origins was investigated analyzing the HMP uptake (adsorption on mineral surface and/or intercalation inside the mineral interlayer) and the ion release mechanisms. HMP adsorption isotherms {{on a standard}} Na-saturated illite were determined at different temperatures providing the thermodynamic parameters {{of the process and}} the maximum adsorbed amount of the ion on this mineral. The data indicate that the adsorption process is hindered compared to that on kaolinite and are consistent with the hypothesis that HMP is chemiadsorbed on the aluminol edge sites, forming Al-O-P linkages. The effect of HMP on the natural illite and montmorillonite samples was analyzed using different techniques. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) measurements were used to detect the concentration of P, Si, Al, Ca, Mg and K in <b>deflocculant</b> solutions wetting the clay minerals in order to detail the immobilization, dissolution and exchange reactions associated to the <b>deflocculant</b> activity.

Other components are added to provide various specific functional characteristics as listed above. Some other common additives include lubricants, shale inhibitors, fluid loss additives (to control loss of drilling fluids into permeable formations). A weighting agent such as barite is added to increase the overall density of the drilling fluid so that sufficient bottom hole pressure can be maintained thereby preventing an unwanted (and often dangerous) influx of formation fluids.|$|R
