40|$|When a color <b>image</b> is <b>converted</b> into a {{monochrome}} one, luminance {{components of}} the pixels {{have been used as}} gray-levels for the representation of the monochrome image in HDTV standard. However, saliencies of the image embedded only in the chrominance components are disappeared in the monochrome <b>image</b> <b>converted</b> by using luminance components. To cope with this problem, A. A. Gooch et al. have proposed the salience-preserving color removal method called “Color 2 Gray. ” The monochrome image well reected the impression of an input color image can be yielded by Color 2 Gray. However, the calculation cost of that algorithm is tremendous, and its utility is not so much. In this paper, fast Color 2 Gray algorithms are proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated through the experiments...|$|R
