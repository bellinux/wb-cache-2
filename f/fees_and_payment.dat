2500|$|Liquidation is the final, most frequent, {{and most}} basic {{insolvency}} procedure. Since registered companies became {{available to the}} investing public, the Joint Stock Companies Winding-Up Act 1844 and all its successors contained a route for a company's life {{to be brought to}} an end. The basic purpose of liquidation is to conclude a company's activities and to sell off assets (i.e. [...] "liquidate", turn goods into [...] "liquid assets" [...] or money) to pay creditors, or shareholders if any value remains. Either the company (its shareholders or directors) can initiate the process through a [...] "voluntary liquidation", or the creditors can force it through a [...] "compulsory liquidation". In urgent circumstances, a provisional liquidation order can also be granted if there is a serious threat to dissipation of a company's assets: in this case, a company may not be notified. By contrast, a voluntary liquidation begins if the company's members vote to liquidate with a 75 per cent special resolution. If the directors can make a statutory declaration that the company is solvent, the directors or shareholders remain in control, but if the company is insolvent, the creditors will control the voluntary winding up. Otherwise, a [...] "compulsory liquidation" [...] may be initiated by either the directors, the company, some shareholders or creditors bringing a petition for winding up to the court. In principle, almost any member (this is usually shareholders, but can also be anyone registered on the company's member list) can bring a petition for liquidation to begin, so long as they have held shares for over six months, or there is only one shareholder. In Re Peveril Gold Mines Ltd Lord Lindley MR held that a company could not obstruct a member's right to bring a petition by requiring that two directors consented or the shareholder had over 20 per cent of share capital. A member's right to bring a petition cannot be changed by a company constitution. However, in Re Rica Gold Washing Co the Court of Appeal invented an extra-statutory requirement that a member must have a sufficient amount of money (£75 was insufficient) invested before bringing a petition. For creditors to bring a petition, there must simply be proof that the creditor is owed a debt that is due. In Mann v Goldstein the incorporated hairdressing and wig business, with shops in Pinner and Haverstock Hill, of two married couples broke down in acrimony. Goldstein and his company petitioned for winding up, claiming unpaid directors <b>fees</b> <b>and</b> <b>payment</b> for a wig delivery, but Mann argued that Goldstein had received the fees through ad hoc payments and another company owed money for the wigs. Ungoed Thomas J held the winding-up petition was not the place to decide the debt actually existed, and it would be an abuse of process to continue.|$|E

Katselas has also been vocal that the issue of negotiable <b>fees</b> <b>and</b> <b>payments</b> are irrelevant when compared to the three biggest costs of any airline: fuel, time and labor, all of which his redesign of PIT from 1987–1992 helped to reduce. In fact, those changes created the most efficient, least costly and least financially wasteful airfield in the world. Although conceding that those updates cost more, he argued they were more than offset by Pittsburgh's vast built-in nonnegotiable fuel and time, and to a lesser degree, labor savings.|$|R

Specifically, they confront theory with practice by asking, to what extent do existing models of interchange fees match up with actual interchange fee practices in various countries? For each of three key countries—Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States—models that “best” fit the competitive and institutional features of that country’s payment card market are identified, and the implications of those models are compared to actual practices. Along what competitive dimensions is there alignment? Along what competitive dimensions is there not alignment? What country-specific factors appear to be important in explaining deviations from theoretical predictions? The results suggest that a theory applicable in one country may not be applicable in another and that similar interchange fee arrangements and regulations may well have different implications in different countries.

40|$|As obras de infraestrutura hÃdrica geralmente esbarram no problema de falta de recursos financeiros para a construÃÃo e operaÃÃo. Levanta-se entÃo a hipÃtese da captaÃÃo dos recursos para construÃÃo de infraestrutura hÃdrica por meio da cobranÃa pelo uso da Ãgua bruta. Pergunta-se entÃo qual seria o impacto na cobranÃa da Ãgua se o custo da construÃÃo da infraestrutura hÃdrica fosse aplicado na cobranÃa pelo uso da Ãgua bruta, juntamente com os custos de AOM (AdministraÃÃo, OperaÃÃo e ManutenÃÃo). Avaliou-se o custo financeiro da implantaÃÃo de sistemas de armazenamento e transferÃncia hÃdrica em atividades de abastecimento dâÃgua, comparando-se o custo unitÃrio da Ãgua bruta com a capacidade de pagamento dos usuÃrios de Ãgua. Utilizaram-se dados de construÃÃo de reservatÃrios e adutoras no CearÃ, calculou-se a anuidade para pagamento destas obras aplicando variÃveis correntes de tempo de pagamento e juros. Com a vazÃo anual regularizada e o custo de construÃÃo das obras, pÃde-se estimar um custo para esta Ãgua, e assim comparÃ-lo Ãs tarifas pagas pelos usuÃrios atualmente e a sua capacidade de pagamento. PÃde-se observar uma relaÃÃo entre os custos de construÃÃo das infraestruturas e as vazÃes regularizadas dos equipamentos de abastecimento estudados (barragens e adutoras). A melhor curva de tendÃncia que se encaixou nos grÃficos de dispersÃo entre os custos de abastecimento estimados para pagamento de infraestrutura âversusâ vazÃo regularizada foi a curva de potÃncia. Os valores obtidos para a capacidade de pagamento em outros trabalhos publicados (Marques, 2009 e Tahal, 2003) se mostraram dentro da ordem de grandeza dos valores obtidos no presente trabalho, levando a se {{considerar}} que existe a possibilidade do pagamento destas obras, de maneira amortizada, para os usuÃrios nÃo a tornando totalmente inviÃvel. The {{works of}} water infrastructure often clash {{over the issue}} of lack of financial resources for the construction and operation. It then becomes the hypothesis of obtaining the funds for water infrastructure construction by charging for the raw water. Then, comes up the question: what is the impact on water charges if the cost of water infrastructure construction would be applied in charging for the raw water, together with the costs of MOM (Management, Operation and Maintenance). We evaluated the financial cost of the deployment of systems of water storage and transfer activities in water supply, comparing the unitary cost of raw water with the ability of users to pay for this water. The data set used was the total costs for the construction of reservoirs and aqueducts in CearÃ, we calculated the annuity payment for these works by applying current variables of time and interest payment. With the annual regulated flow and cost of construction works, we could estimate a cost for this water, and then compare it to current user <b>fees</b> <b>and</b> <b>payment</b> capacity. Was observed a relationship between the cost of building infrastructure and regular drainage equipment supply studied (dams and pipelines). The best trend line that fit the scatterplots between supply costs estimated for the payment of infrastructure âversusâ regulated flow was the power curve. The values obtained for the ability to pay in other published works (Marques, 2009 and Tahal, 2003) were within an order of magnitude of values obtained in this work, leading to consider that there is a possibility for the users to pay for these works, in an amortized way, so it doesnât become totally impracticable...|$|E
