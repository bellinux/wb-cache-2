40|$|An {{integral}} {{calculation method}} (ICM) is presented for fully estimating the fiber orientation and fundamental physical and mechanical properties of softwood (SW) logs and lumber. The proposed ICM reproduces with great detail {{the most important}} anatomical features of SW, including annual rings, seasonal variations, main growth patterns (straight, spiral, and interlocked grain), and especially fiber distortions due to <b>knot</b> <b>clusters</b> for each annual ring. The failure load of the lumber has been predicted with an absolute error of 10. 2 %. In addition, the ICM has shown very strong robustness and high calculation speed {{as most of the}} calculations are performed analytically, and only one final simplistic computation is conducted by finite element analysis (FEA). This article describes the proposed ICM in detail and shows the initial verification with experiments. The ICM should contribute not only to lumber research and grading but also to research and optimization of logging and sawing industrial processes...|$|R

40|$|Part 2 : Full PapersInternational audienceThe knot {{model is}} aimed at obtaining a trust-based {{reputation}} in communities of strangers. It identifies groups of trustees, denoted as knots and among whom overall trust is strong, and is thus considered the most capable solution for providing reputation information to other members within the same knot. The problem of identifying knots in a trust network is modeled as a graph clustering problem. When considering dynamic and large-scale communities, the task of keeping the clustering correct over time is a great challenge. This paper introduces a clustering maintenance algorithm based on the properties of knots of trust. A maintenance strategy is defined that addresses violations of knot properties due to changes in trust relations that occur with time {{in response to the}} dynamic nature of the community. Based on this strategy, a reputation management procedure is implemented in two phases: the first identifies the essence of change and makes a decision regarding the need to improve <b>knot</b> <b>clustering.</b> The second phase locally modifies the clustering to preserve a stable network structure while keeping the network correctly clustered with respect to the knot utility function. We demonstrate by simulation the efficiency of the maintenance algorithm in preserving knots quality, for cases in which only local changes have occurred, to ensure the reliability of the reputation system...|$|R

40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityA three-dimensional finite element model was used to predict the strength and location of failure of nine wood transmission poles. The poles were made from three commonlyused species (western redcedar, Douglas-fir and southern pine) in North America. All poles were tested to failure as a cantilever beam with a concentrated load applied to the tip. The methodology involved was to select several eighteen inches long segments, located along the poles, which contained the most severe defects such as <b>cluster</b> of <b>knots,</b> spiral grain, including material inhomogeneity in the highly stressed region. Each segment was analyzed using the finite element technique with appropriate boundary conditions. Material properties for each segment were determined by measuring clear-wood elastic and strength parameters in boles taken from broken poles. The information about knots and spiral grain, obtained by visual inspection of the pole surface, was used to identify the worst <b>knot</b> <b>clusters</b> and grain deviation in any segment. Knots were modeled in the finite element mesh and the localized grain deviation around the knots were determined {{through the use of}} the flow-grain analogy model. Finite element computer analysis were performed through the use of the program GTSTRUDL. The model resulted in a total of 288 three-dimensional, isoparametric, linear strain, 20 -node parallelepiped and 15 -node wedge shaped elements. For the nine poles studied, the results showed good agreement between predicted and experimental strength. The predicted values for strength differed from the actual ones with an average deviation of 7 % (below the actual). Concerning failure location, in six of the poles, failure was verified in the same places as those predicted by the model. In the three other cases the failure with the maximum error of three feet, except for one pole where the deviation was twelve feet. The study revealed that the three-dimensional finite element approach to model growth characteristics applied to the more critical segments along the pole length proved to be very useful tool for strength and failure location prediction of poles...|$|R

40|$|We study Weinstein 4 -manifolds which admit Lagrangian skeleta {{given by}} {{attaching}} disks to a surface along {{a collection of}} simple closed curves. In terms of the curves describing one such skeleton, we describe surgeries that preserve the ambient Weinstein manifold, but change the skeleton. The surgeries can be iterated to produce more such skeleta [...] - in many cases, infinitely many more. Each skeleton is built around a Lagrangian surface. Passing to the Fukaya category, the skeletal surgeries induce cluster transformations on the spaces of rank one local systems on these surfaces, and noncommutative analogues of cluster transformations on the spaces of higher rank local systems. In particular, the problem of producing and distinguishing such Lagrangians maps {{to a combination of}} combinatorial-geometric questions about curve configurations on surfaces and algebraic questions about exchange graphs of cluster algebras. Conversely, this expands the dictionary relating the cluster theory of character varieties, positroid strata, and related spaces to the symplectic geometry of Lagrangian fillings of Legendrian <b>knots,</b> by incorporating <b>cluster</b> charts more general than those associated to bicolored surface graphs.

The London to which Benham came from Cambridge and the disquisitions of Prothero was not the London of a mature and disillusioned vision.

40|$|We {{develop an}} {{analysis}} of sharp and fuzzy RD designs, based on a new approach for non-parametrically estimating the unknown functions of the forcing variable and, {{in the case of}} the fuzzy design, a new modeling of the unobserved confounder. Several novel ideas are employed. First, in estimating the functions of the forcing variable, we include a knot at the threshold, which is not in general an observed value of the forcing variable, to al-low for curvature in the estimated functions from the breakpoint to the nearest values on either side of the breakpoint. Second, we <b>cluster</b> <b>knots</b> close to the threshold with the aim of controlling the approximation bias. Third, we introduce a new second-difference prior on the spline coefficients that can deal with unequally spaced knots. The number of knots and other features of the model are compared through marginal likelihoods and Bayes factors. Fourth, in the fuzzy case, instead of assuming that the confounder is continuous, as in the models to date, we suppose that the confounder is a discrete random variable that represents one of three exogenous subject-types, compliers, never-takers and always-takers. We show that under certain mild conditions, the effect of the forcing variable on the mean outcome...|$|R
40|$|The {{topology}} and {{geometry of}} closed defect loops is studied in chiral nematic colloids with variable chirality. The colloidal particles with perpendicular surface anchoring of liquid crystalline molecules are inserted in a twisted nematic cell with the thickness {{that is only}} slightly larger than {{the diameter of the}} colloidal particle. The total twist of the chiral nematic structure in cells with parallel boundary conditions is set to 0, π, 2 π, and 3 π, respectively. We use the laser tweezers to discern the number and the topology of the - 1 / 2 defect loops entangling colloidal particles. For a single colloidal particle, we observe that a single defect loop is winding around the particle, with the winding pattern being more complex in cells with higher total twist. We observe that colloidal dimers and colloidal clusters are always entangled by one or several - 1 / 2 defect loops. For colloidal pairs in π-twisted cells, we identify at least 17 different entangled structures, some of them exhibiting linked defect loops-Hopf link. Colloidal entanglement is even richer with a higher number of colloidal particles, where we observe not only linked, but also colloidal <b>clusters</b> <b>knotted</b> into the trefoil knot.

40|$|The Universe on scales 10 - 100 h^- 1 Mpc is {{dominated}} by a cosmic web of voids, filaments, sheets and <b>knots</b> of galaxy <b>clusters.</b> These structures participate differently in the global expansion of the Universe: from non-expanding clusters to the above average expansion rate of voids. In this paper we characterize Hubble expansion anisotropies in the COMPOSITE sample of 4534 galaxies and clusters. We concentrate on the dipole and quadrupole in the rest frame of the Local Group. These both have statistically significant amplitudes. These anisotropies, and their redshift dependence, cannot be explained solely by a boost of the Local Group in the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) model which expands isotropically in the rest frame of {{the cosmic microwave background}} (CMB) radiation. We simulate the local expansion of the Universe with inhomogeneous Szekeres models, which match the standard FLRW model on > 100 h^- 1 Mpc scales but exhibit nonkinematic relativistic differential expansion on small scales. We restrict models to be consistent with observed CMB temperature anisotropies, while simultaneously fitting the redshift variation of the Hubble expansion dipole. We include features to account for both the Local Void and the "Great Attractor". While this naturally accounts for the Hubble expansion and CMB dipoles, the simulated quadrupoles are smaller than observed. Further refinement to incorporate additional structures may improve this. This would enable a test of the hypothesis that some large angle CMB anomalies result from failing to treat the relativistic differential expansion of the background geometry, a natural feature of solutions to Einstein's equations not included in the current standard model of cosmology.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade the use of fleets of gliders {{has proven to be}} an {{effective}} way for sampling the ocean for long-duration missions (order of months). In a previous study [1] a method for adaptive sampling the ocean using fleets of gliders based on the use of a clustering algorithm has been introduced. The key ideas were: i) build a 2 D mesh grid over the synoptic uncertainty of the ocean field to sample with “knots” having density proportional {{to the level of the}} uncertainty; ii) group this set of <b>knots</b> using a <b>clustering</b> algorithm, i. e. the Fuzzy C-Means (a fuzzy variant of the well-known K-Means algorithm). The centroids are the next way-points for the gliders. However, that method assumed all-maneuverable assets. In this study we extend it by exploiting the existence of non-maneuverable assets, i. e. fixed buoys (a situation that frequently occurs in real scenarios) and by considering time-dependent uncertainty, i. e. aiming to reach the way-points at time t such that the uncertainty at future times is minimized. The first essential idea is to consider the positions of fixed buoys as part of the centroids to obtain from the clustering algorithm: the remaining centroids to be computed will be considered as the next positions where to send each glider. By using the clustering algorithm described in [2], called “Partially Provided Centroids Fuzzy C-Means” (PPC-FCM), we have been able to exploit the presence of fixed buoys by sending the gliders in regions not already covered by the buoys/floats. This allows a better distribution (lower overlapping) of the sensing assets, with respect to the direct use of the standard Fuzzy C-Means, uninformed of the presence of the buoys. The second idea is to replace the synoptic uncertainty field by the field of mutual information between the way points at time t and a selected future time. We have built a prototype of this novel adaptive sampling scheme for mixed assets (maneuverable and non-maneuverable) that automatically retrieves ocean forecasts (currents, temperature, salinity, etc.) from MyOcean services. In addition, the prototype comes with a graphical user interfaces that facilitates the selection of the region of interest for data download. Once the data have been downloaded with low efforts, the (PPC-FCM) algorithm is run to get the next gliders way-points. The procedure is then repeated any time new forecasts are available. Our tool will be even more effective if MyOcean forecast products in future releases contain, other than the expected (mean) value of the field of interest obtained from forecasting models, a measure of the associated uncertainty, such as standard deviations. By including this uncertainty estimate, glider mission planners would have valuable information on where to send the assets in order to reduce the uncertainty as much as possible.

6000|$|Far {{different}} {{were the}} days to which these anecdotes have carried me back. The dark guesses of some zealous Quidnunc met with so congenial a soil in the grave alarm of a titled Dogberry of our neighbourhood, that a spy was actually sent down from the government pour surveillance of myself and friend. There must have been not only abundance, but variety of these [...] "honourable men" [...] {{at the disposal of}} Ministers: for this proved a very honest fellow. After three weeks' truly Indian perseverance in tracking us, (for we were commonly together,) during all which time seldom were we out of doors, but he contrived to be within hearing,--(and all the while utterly unsuspected; how indeed could such a suspicion enter our fancies?)--he not only rejected Sir Dogberry's request that he would try yet a little longer, but declared to him his belief, that both my friend and myself were as good subjects, for aught he could discover to the contrary, as any in His Majesty's dominions. He had repeatedly hid himself, he said, for hours together behind a bank at the sea-side, (our favourite seat,) and overheard our conversation. At first he fancied, that we were aware of our danger; for he often heard me talk of one Spy Nozy, which he was inclined to interpret of himself, and of a remarkable feature belonging to him; but he was speedily convinced that it was the name {{of a man who had}} made a book and lived long ago. Our talk ran most upon books, and we were perpetually desiring each other to look at this, and to listen to that; but he could not catch a word about politics. Once he had joined me on the road; (this occurred, as I was returning home alone from my friend's house, which was about three miles from my own cottage,) and, passing himself off as a traveller, he had entered into conversation with me, and talked of purpose in a democrat way in order to draw me out. The result, it appears, not only convinced him that I was no friend of jacobinism; but, (he added,) I had [...] "plainly made it out to be such a silly as well as wicked thing, that he felt ashamed though he had only put it on." [...] I distinctly remembered the occurrence, and had mentioned it immediately on my return, repeating what the traveller with his Bardolph nose had said, with my own answer; and so little did I suspect the true object of my [...] "tempter ere accuser," [...] that I expressed with no small pleasure my hope and belief, that the conversation had been of some service to the poor misled malcontent. This incident therefore prevented all doubt as to the truth of the report, which through a friendly medium came to me from the master of the village inn, who had been ordered to entertain the Government gentleman in his best manner, but above all to be silent concerning such a person being in his house. At length he received Sir Dogberry's commands to accompany his guest at the final interview; and, after the absolving suffrage of the gentleman honoured with the confidence of Ministers, answered, as follows, to the following queries: D. [...] "Well, landlord! and what do you know of the person in question? L. I see him often pass by with maister ----, my landlord, (that is, the owner of the house,) and sometimes with the new-comers at Holford; but I never said a word to him or he to me. D. But do you not know, that he has distributed papers and hand-bills of a seditious nature among the common people? L. No, your Honour! I never heard of such a thing. D. Have you not seen this Mr. Coleridge, or heard of, his haranguing and talking to <b>knots</b> and <b>clusters</b> of the inhabitants?--What are you grinning at, Sir? L. Beg your Honour's pardon! but I was only thinking, how they'd have stared at him. If what I have heard be true, your Honour! they would not have understood a word he said. When our Vicar was here, Dr. L. the master of the great school and Canon of Windsor, there was a great dinner party at maister's; and one of the farmers, that was there, told us that he and the Doctor talked real Hebrew Greek at each other for an hour together after dinner. D. Answer the question, Sir! does he ever harangue the people? L. I hope your Honour an't angry with me. I can say no more than I know. I never saw him talking with any one, but my landlord, and our curate, and the strange gentleman. D. Has he not been seen wandering on the hills towards the Channel, and along the shore, with books and papers in his hand, taking charts and maps of the country? L. Why, as to that, your Honour! I own, I have heard; I am sure, I would not wish to say ill of any body; but it is certain, that I have heard--D. Speak out, man! don't be afraid, you are doing your duty to your King and Government. What have you heard? L. Why, folks do say, your Honour! as how that he is a Poet, and that he is going to put Quantock and all about here in print; and as they be so much together, I suppose that the strange gentleman has some consarn in the business."--So ended this formidable inquisition, the latter part of which alone requires explanation, and at the same time entitles the anecdote to a place in my literary life. I had considered it as a defect in the admirable poem of THE TASK, that the subject, which gives the title to the work, was not, and indeed could not be, carried on beyond the three or four first pages, and that, throughout the poem, the connections are frequently awkward, and the transitions abrupt and arbitrary. I sought for a subject, that should give equal room and freedom for description, incident, and impassioned reflections on men, nature, and society, yet supply in itself a natural connection to the parts, and unity to the whole. Such a subject I conceived myself to have found in a stream, traced from its source in the hills among the yellow-red moss and conical glass-shaped tufts of bent, to the first break or fall, where its drops become audible, and it begins to form a channel; thence to the peat and turf barn, itself built of the same dark squares as it sheltered; to the sheepfold; to the first cultivated plot of ground; to the lonely cottage and its bleak garden won from the heath; to the hamlet, the villages, the market-town, the manufactories, and the seaport. My walks therefore were almost daily on the top of Quantock, and among its sloping coombes. With my pencil and memorandum-book in my hand, I was making studies, as the artists call them, and often moulding my thoughts into verse, with the objects and imagery immediately before my senses. Many circumstances, evil and good, intervened to prevent the completion of the poem, which was to have been entitled THE BROOK. Had I finished the work, it was my purpose in the heat of the moment to have dedicated it to our then committee of public safety as containing the charts and maps, with which I was to have supplied the French Government in aid of their plans of invasion. And these too for a tract of coast that, from Clevedon to Minehead, scarcely permits the approach of a fishing-boat! ...|$|R
