40|$|ABSTRACT: The water {{splitting}} reaction {{based on the}} promising TiO 2 photocatalyst {{is one of the}} fundamental processes that bears significant implication in hydrogen energy technology and has been extensively studied. However, a long-standing puzzling question in understanding the reaction sequence <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> splitting is whether the initial reaction step is a photocatalytic process and how it happens. Here, using the low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) performed at 80 K, we observed the <b>dissociation</b> <b>of</b> individually adsorbed <b>water</b> molecules at the 5 -fold coordinated Ti (Ti 5 c) sites of the reduced TiO 2 (110) - 1 × 1 surface under the irradiation of UV lights with the wavelength shorter than 400 nm, or to say its energy larger than the band gap of 3. 1 eV for the rutile TiO 2. This finding thus clearly suggests the involvement <b>of</b> a photocatalytic <b>dissociation</b> process that produces two kinds of hydroxyl species. One is always present at the adjacent bridging oxygen sites, that is, OHbr, and the other either occurs as OHt at Ti 5 c sites away from the original ones or even desorbs from the surface. In comparison, the tip-induced <b>dissociation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> can only produce OHt or oxygen adatoms exactly at the original Ti 5 c sites, without the trace of OHbr. Such a difference clearly indicates that the photocatalytic <b>dissociation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> undergoes a process that differs significantly from the attachment of electrons injected by the tip. Our results imply that the initial step <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> <b>dissociation</b> under the UV light irradiation may not be reduced by the electrons, but most likely oxidized by the holes generated by the photons. 1...|$|R
50|$|HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid) is a {{zwitterionic}} {{organic chemical}} buffering agent; {{one of the}} twenty Good's buffers. HEPES is widely used in cell culture, largely because it is better at maintaining physiological pH despite changes in carbon dioxide concentration (produced by cellular respiration) when compared to bicarbonate buffers, which are also commonly used in cell culture. The <b>dissociation</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> decreases with falling temperature, but the dissociation constants (pK) of many other buffers do not change much with temperature. HEPES is like water in that its dissociation decreases as the temperature decreases. This makes HEPES a more effective buffering agent for maintaining enzyme structure and function at low temperatures. Lepe-Zuniga et al. reported a phototoxicity of HEPES when exposed to ambient light by the production of hydrogen peroxide, {{which is not a}} problem in bicarbonate-based cell culture buffers. It is therefore strongly advised to keep HEPES-containing solutions in darkness as much as possible.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are some}} {{significant}} approximations {{implicit in the}} Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The most significant {{is the assumption that}} the concentration of the acid and its conjugate base at equilibrium will remain the same as the formal concentration. This neglects the dissociation of the acid and the binding of H+ to the base. The <b>dissociation</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and relative water concentration itself is neglected as well. These approximations will fail when dealing with relatively strong acids or bases (pKa more than a couple units away from 7), dilute or very concentrated solutions (less than 1 mM or greater than 1M), or heavily skewed acid/base ratios (more than 100 to 1). In high buffer dilutions, where the concentration of protons arising from water become equally or more prevalent than the buffer species themselves (at pH 7, this means buffer component concentrations of <10−5 M formally, but practically much higher), the pKa of the [...] "buffer" [...] system will tend towards neutrality.|$|E
50|$|Pure {{water is}} neutral. When an acid is {{dissolved}} in water, the pH {{will be less}} than 7. When a base, or alkali, is dissolved in water, the pH will be greater than 7. A solution of a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid, at concentration 1 mol dm−3 has a pH of 0. A solution of a strong alkali, such as sodium hydroxide, at concentration 1 mol dm−3, has a pH of 14. Thus, measured pH values will lie mostly in the range 0 to 14, though negative pH values and values above 14 are entirely possible. Since pH is a logarithmic scale, a difference of one pH unit is equivalent to a tenfold difference in hydrogen ion concentration. The pH of neutrality is not exactly 7, although {{this is a good}} approximation in most cases. Neutrality is defined as the condition where H+ = OH− (or the activities are equal). Since self-ionization of water holds the product of these concentration H+&times;OH− = Kw, {{it can be seen that}} at neutrality H+ = OH− =&radic;(Kw), or pH = pKw/2. pKw is approximately 14 but depends on ionic strength and temperature, and so the pH of neutrality does also. Pure water and a solution of NaCl in pure water are both neutral, since <b>dissociation</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> produces equal numbers of both ions. However the pH of the neutral NaCl solution will be slightly different from that of neutral pure water because the hydrogen and hydroxide ions' activity is dependent on ionic strength, so Kw varies with ionic strength.|$|E

50|$|In chemistry, {{the study}} of sonochemistry is {{concerned}} with understanding the effect of ultrasound in forming acoustic cavitation in liquids, resulting in the initiation or enhancement of the chemical activity in the solution. Therefore, the chemical effects of ultrasound do not come from adirect interaction of the ultrasonic sound wave with the molecules in the solution. The simplest explanation {{for this is that}} sound waves propagating through a liquid at ultrasonic frequencies do so with a wavelength that is significantly longer than that of the bond length between atoms in the molecule. Therefore, the sound wave cannot affect that vibrational energy of the bond, and can therefore not directly increase the internal energy of a molecule. Instead, sonochemistry arises from acoustic cavitation: the formation, growth, and implosive collapse of bubbles in a liquid. The collapse of these bubbles is an almost adiabatic process, thereby resulting in the massive build-up of energy inside the bubble, resulting in extremely high temperatures and pressures in a microscopic region of the sonicated liquid. The high temperatures and pressures result in the chemical excitation of any matter that was inside of, or in the immediate surroundings of the bubble as it rapidly imploded. A broad variety of outcomes can result from acoustic cavitation, including sonoluminescence, increased chemical activity in the solution due to the formation of primary and secondary radical reactions, and increase chemical activity through the formation of new, relatively stable chemical species that can diffuse further into the solution to create chemical effects (for example, the formation of hydrogen peroxide from the combination of two hydroxyl radicals formed following the <b>dissociation</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> vapor inside the collapsing bubbles what water is exposed to ultrasound.|$|E
