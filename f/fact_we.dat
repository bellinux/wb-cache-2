5|$|An {{additional}} development which reduced Gill Sans' dominance was {{the arrival}} of phototypesetting, which allowed typefaces to be printed from photographs on film and (especially in display use – hot metal continued for some body text setting for longer) massively increased the range of typefaces that could cheaply be used. Dry transfers like Letraset had a similar effect for smaller projects; their sans-serif Compacta and Stephenson Blake's Impact exemplified the design trends of the period by choosing dense, industrial designs. Of the period from the 1930s to 1950s, {{when he was growing}} up, James Mosley would later write: The Monotype classics dominated the typographical landscape... in Britain, at any rate, they were so ubiquitous that, while their excellent quality was undeniable, it was possible to be bored by them and to begin to rebel against the bland good taste that they represented. In <b>fact</b> <b>we</b> were already aware by 1960 that they might not be around to bore us for too long. The death of metal type... seemed at last to be happening.|$|E
5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the <b>fact</b> <b>we</b> were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E

25|$|Hogan has {{emphasised}} that {{it would}} be very strange if all fundamental constants were strictly determined, since this would leave us with no ready explanation for apparent fine tuning. In <b>fact</b> <b>we</b> might have to resort to something akin to Barrow and Tipler's SAP: there would be no option for such a universe not to support life.|$|E

25|$|It {{was never}} a success financially. In <b>fact,</b> <b>we</b> lost money, if I {{remember}} correctly, on every single release bar one. I did quite like it but it was terribly indulgent. Not as indulgent {{as it would have}} been had I not had a business partner, admittedly... I liked having a label. It enabled you to put out stuff that you liked without, in those days, having to worry about whether it was going to work commercially. I've never been a good business man.|$|E
25|$|Our {{considerations}} also yield a free construction for morphisms that do preserve meets {{instead of}} joins (i.e. upper adjoints of Galois connections). In <b>fact,</b> <b>we</b> merely have to dualize {{what was said}} above: free objects are given as powersets ordered by reverse inclusion, such that set union provides the meet operation, and the function f° is {{defined in terms of}} meets instead of joins. The result of this construction could be called a free complete meet-semilattice. One should also note how these free constructions extend those that are used to obtain free semilattices, where we only need to consider finite sets.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture and {{forestry}} {{is an area}} {{of opportunity}} for the country. “Angola requires 4.5 million tonnes a year of grain but grows only about 55% of the corn it needs, 20% of the rice and just 5% of its required wheat”(African economic Outlook) but “less than 3 percent of Angola's abundant fertile land is cultivated and the economic potential of the forestry sector remains largely unexploited” (World Bank). From this <b>fact</b> <b>we</b> can appreciate the capacity that Angola has to increase production for not only for the national market but also the international one. Investing in this sector can help reduce unemployment and more specifically in the rural areas. This will undoubtedly have consequences on the living standard of rural civilians.|$|E

25|$|However, {{things are}} not quite that simple. The zero-point energy cannot be {{eliminated}} by dropping its energy from the Hamiltonian: When we do this and solve the Heisenberg equation for a field operator, we must include the vacuum field, which is the homogeneous {{part of the solution}} for the field operator. In <b>fact</b> <b>we</b> can show that the vacuum field is essential for the preservation of the commutators and the formal consistent of QED. When we calculate the field energy we obtain not only a contribution from particles and forces that may be present but also a contribution from the vacuum field itself i.e. the zero-point field energy. In other words, the zero-point energy reappears even though we may have deleted it from the Hamiltonian.|$|E
25|$|The erasures were {{sporadic}} and haphazard, {{with only}} the more visible and accessible images of Hatshepsut being removed; had it been more complete, we would not now have so many images of Hatshepsut. Thutmose III may have died before these changes were finished {{and it may be}} that he never intended a total obliteration of her memory. In <b>fact,</b> <b>we</b> have no evidence to support the assumption that Thutmose hated or resented Hatshepsut during her lifetime. Had that been true, as head of the army, in a position given to him by Hatshepsut (who was clearly not worried about her co-regent's loyalty), he surely could have led a successful coup, but he made no attempt to challenge her authority during her reign and, her accomplishments and images remained featured on all of the public buildings she built for twenty years after her death.|$|E
25|$|Mark Tauber, senior {{vice-president}} of HarperOne, {{has stated that}} the Green Bible was developed {{with the intention of}} being “the first ever specialty bible that takes the issues of sustainability, stewardship of the earth, what many in the religious community call ‘creation care’ very seriously”. He went further, exposing on the Green Bible’s purpose: “That the Bible has a profound message of sustainability—some might argue, the original message—is not all that surprising. What is surprising {{is that it is not}} one of the first things that comes to mind when most folks think about the Bible and its message... this Bible seeks to change that <b>fact.</b> <b>We</b> believe that the unique and specially added features by some of today's most important thinkers, writers and leaders, across the ecumenical spectrum make it a must-have for those who already find motivation, comfort and inspiration in it and for the many more who might see it freshly as a critical resource in their journey to sustain our planet”.|$|E

500|$|From {{his early}} days, Auerbach was {{convinced}} that the fast break, where a team used a quick outlet pass to fast guards who run downcourt and score before the opponent had re-established position, was a potent tactical weapon. This new strategy proved lethal for the opposition. Further, Auerbach moved emphasis away from individual accolades and instilled the teamwork element into his players. He also invented the concept of the role player and of the sixth man, stating: [...] "Individual honors are nice, but no Celtic has ever gone {{out of his way to}} achieve them. We have never had the league's top scorer. In <b>fact,</b> <b>we</b> won seven league championships without placing even one among the league's top 10 scorers.

[...] Seeing his cause was hopeless, Romney announced his withdrawal as a presidential candidate on February 28, 1968.
