50|$|Levomethadone is a μ-opioid {{receptor}} agonist with higher intrinsic activity than morphine, but lower affinity. Dextromethadone {{does not affect}} opioid receptors but binds to the glutamatergic NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor, and thus acts as a receptor antagonist against glutamate. Methadone {{has been shown to}} reduce neuropathic pain in rat models, primarily through NMDA antagonism. Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS. NMDA receptors have a very important role in modulating long-term excitation and memory formation. NMDA antagonists such as dextromethorphan (DXM), ketamine (a dissociative anaesthetic, also M.O.A+.), tiletamine (a veterinary anaesthetic) and ibogaine (from the African tree Tabernanthe iboga, also M.O.A+.) are being studied for their role in decreasing the development of tolerance to opioids and as possible for eliminating addiction/tolerance/withdrawal, possibly by disrupting memory circuitry. Acting as an NMDA antagonist may be one mechanism by which methadone decreases craving for opioids and tolerance, and has been proposed as a possible mechanism for its distinguished efficacy regarding the treatment of neuropathic pain. The dextrorotary form (<b>d-methadone)</b> acts as an NMDA antagonist and is devoid of opioid activity: it has been shown to produce analgesia in experimental models of chronic pain. Methadone also acted as a potent, noncompetitive α3β4 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist in rat receptors, expressed in human embryonic kidney cell lines.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Methadone is {{a potent}} {{analgesic}} used to treat refractory cancer pain. It is administered as a racemic mixture, with the l-enantiomer being primarily a μ-receptor agonist, whereas the d-enantiomer is an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist and inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Dose requirements vary greatly among patients to achieve optimal pain control and to avoid the risk of adverse effects. The relationship between plasma and saliva methadone enantiomer concentrations was investigated to determine if saliva could be a substitute for plasma in pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies for clinical monitoring and dose optimization of methadone in patients with advanced cancer. Methods: Patients with advanced cancer who were prescribed varying doses of oral methadone for pain management were recruited to obtain paired plasma and saliva samples. Pain scores were recorded {{at the time of}} sampling. The total and unbound plasma and saliva concentrations of the l- and d-enantiomers of methadone were quantified by using an HPLC-MS/ MS method. The relationship between plasma (total and unbound) and saliva concentrations were compared. The saliva-to-plasma concentration ratio was compared versus the dose administered and the time after dosing for both enantiomers. The association of methadone concentrations with reported pain scores was compared by using a Mann-Whitney U test for significance. Findings: Fifty patients receiving a mean dose of 11 mg/d of methadone provided 151 paired plasma and saliva samples. The median age of the population was 61 years with an interquartile range of 53 - 71 years with total body weight ranging from 59 - 88 kg. Median (interquartile) total plasma concentrations for l- and <b>d-methadone</b> were 50. 78 ng/mL (30. 6 – 113. 0 ng/mL) and 62. 0 ng/mL (28. 7 – 116. 0 ng/mL), respectively. Median (interquartile range) saliva concentrations for l- and <b>d-methadone</b> were 81. 5 ng/mL (28. 0 – 203. 2 ng/mL) and 44. 2 (16. 2 – 149. 7 ng/mL). No relationship could be established between plasma and saliva concentrations for l- and <b>d-methadone</b> (r 2 ¼ 0. 35 and 0. 25). The saliva-to-plasma concentration analyzed with the methadone dose showed higher saliva concentrations at lower doses. Dose-normalized saliva concentrations followed a similar pattern over time compared with plasma concentrations. No correlation was found between l-methadone plasma, dmethadone plasma, l-methadone saliva, <b>d-methadone</b> saliva concentrations, and pain score. Implications: Saliva concentration was not a better predictor of pain control than plasma concentration for dose optimization and monitoring studies of methadone in patients with cancer. Although the saliva-to-plasma ratio of the concentration of methadone enantiomers was stable across the dosing range, due to the variability in individual saliva-to-plasma ratios, saliva sampling may not be a valid substitute in pharmacokinetic studies of methadone in cancer.

40|$|The plasma {{concentrations}} of alpha 1 -acid glycoprotein (AAG), albumin, triglycerides, cholesterol, and total proteins, {{as well as}} the plasma binding of racemic, <b>d-methadone,</b> and l-methadone were measured in 45 healthy subjects. The AAG phenotypes and the {{concentrations of}} AAG variants were also determined. The measured free fractions for racemic, <b>d-methadone,</b> and l-methadone were, respectively, 12. 7 % +/- 3. 3 %, 10. 0 % +/- 2. 9 %, and 14. 2 % +/- 3. 2 % (mean +/- SD). A significant correlation was obtained between the binding ratio (B/F) for dl-methadone and the total AAG concentration (r = 0. 724; p less than 0. 001). A multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that AAG was the main explanatory variable for the binding of the racemate. When concentrations of AAG variants were considered, a significant correlation was obtained between the binding ratio of dl-methadone and orosomucoid 2 A concentration (r = 0. 715; p less than 0. 001), a weak correlation between dl-methadone and orosomucoid 1 S concentration (r = 0. 494; p less than 0. 001), and no correlation between dl-methadone and orosomucoid 1 F 1 concentration (r = 0. 049; not significant). Similar findings were obtained with the enantiomers. This study shows the importance of considering not only total AAG but also concentrations of AAG variants when measuring the binding of methadone and possibly of other drugs in plasma...|$|E
40|$|Pharmacological {{differences}} among opioid drugs {{have been observed}} in in vitro and in vivo preclinical models, as well as clinically, implying that all opioids may not be working through the same mechanism of action. Here we demonstrate analgesic synergy between L-methadone and several opioid ligands. Of the compounds examined, L-methadone selectively synergizes with morphine, morphine- 6 -glucuronide, codeine, and the active metabolite of heroin, 6 -acetylmorphine. Mor-phine synergizes only with L-methadone. In analgesic assays, <b>D-methadone</b> was inactive alone and did not enhance morphine analgesia when the two were given together, confirming that L-methadone was not acting through N-methyl-D-aspartate mechanisms. Both L-methadone and morphine displayed only additive effects when paired with oxymorphone, oxycodone...|$|E
40|$|Numerous pharmacologic {{agents have}} been shown to {{decrease}} adrenal ascorbic acid but the specific manner in which each agent elicits this effect remains ob-scure. It is well established that a reduction in adrenal ascorbic acid follows ACTH release by the adenohypophysis and more recent evidence indicates that the integrity of the hypothalamus is also essential (Harris, 1952; Hume, 1952; McCann, 1953; Porter, 1953, 1954; George and Way, 1957). These findings serve to define further the common pathways involved in drug activation of adrenal responses but yield no information as to the effector mechanisms in-volved. One approach to this problem has been the use of chemical blocking agents to differentiate the possible modes in which various pharmacologic agents may activate the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. Thus, it was recently shown in the rat that nalorphine blocks the adrenal ascorbate depleting effects of morphine and i-methadone but not the effects of aspirin and <b>d-methadone</b> (George and Way, 1955). As a consequence, it was suggested that different receptors or site...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} these studies was to {{evaluate}} the performance characteristics of the Cozart ® Microplate Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) for the determination of methadone in oral fluid from patients in a drug misuse treatment program. Oral fluid specimens were collected using the Cozart ® RapiScan Collection system from 198 donors who were receiving treatment for their addiction and were monitored for drug misuse. Oral fluid specimens were also collected from forty volunteer donors who were not drug users. The specimens were analyzed in the laboratory by EIA and then analysed for methadone and its main metabolite EDDP by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A total of 103 samples were confirmed positive for methadone. The Cozart ® Microplate EIA for <b>d-Methadone</b> in oral fluid using a cutoff of 30 ng/mL in diluted oral fluid had a sensitivity of 91. 3 %± 2. 8 % and a specificity of 100 %± 1. 0 % vs. GC-MS...|$|E
