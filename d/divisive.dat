5|$|In the Democratic primary, Tydings was {{challenged}} by perennial candidate and Dixiecrat George P. Mahoney and two others. After a <b>divisive</b> campaign, Tydings beat Mahoney by 53% to 37%.|$|E
5|$|Bede is {{somewhat}} reticent about {{the career of}} Wilfrid, a contemporary {{and one of the}} most prominent clerics of his day. This may be because Wilfrid's opulent lifestyle was uncongenial to Bede's monastic mind; it may also be that the events of Wilfrid's life, <b>divisive</b> and controversial as they were, simply did not fit with Bede's theme of the progression to a unified and harmonious church.|$|E
5|$|Sorabji's isolation, and {{sometimes}} the resulting lack of interaction with the music world, have {{been the target of}} criticism even by his admirers. His writings have also been highly <b>divisive,</b> being described by some as profoundly perceptive and enlightening, and by others as misguided.|$|E
5|$|Sport {{has been}} both {{one of the most}} unifying {{cultural}} forces in Northern England and, thanks to local rivalries such as the Lancashire–Yorkshire Roses rivalry, one of the most <b>divisive.</b> As huge numbers of people moved into recently-built cities with little cultural heritage, local sports teams offered the population a sense of place and identity that was otherwise absent.|$|E
5|$|The DLM {{appeals for}} {{administrative}} {{reform in the}} public sector through a decentralization, modernization, and mechanization plan. It defends human rights and calls for the respect of public freedoms and rule of law. Listed within its platform is support for the marginalized and the abandonment of <b>divisive</b> particularism. The movement supports prohibiting the discrimination of the disabled.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} {{has received a}} <b>divisive</b> response. While some sources criticized the character's design for clashing with the game's aesthetic, some others praised the visual appeal of the character when in motion. Some have called Necrid {{one of the best}} characters introduced to the series; others deem him one of the worst.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} griots are {{songs of}} praise, but Malouma used {{her voice to}} speak out against child marriages, racial and ethnic discrimination, slavery and other <b>divisive</b> issues facing a country at the crossroads of the Arab world and Africa. She also sang about illiteracy, HIV/AIDS awareness and in support of children's vaccinations.|$|E
5|$|While {{his support}} for Lang had enabled Heffron to {{accelerate}} his political career, he found himself increasingly unhappy with Lang's autocratic and <b>divisive</b> political style, which had been amplified by the Great Depression, the expulsion of the NSW branch of the Labor Party from the federal branch and the ultimate dismissal of Lang's government in 1932 by Governor Sir Philip Game.|$|E
5|$|As Nixon {{prepared}} for the August 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, he discussed possible running mates with his staff. Among these were Ronald Reagan, the conservative Governor of California, and the more liberal Mayor of New York City, John Lindsay. Nixon felt that these high-profile names could split the party, and looked for a less <b>divisive</b> figure. He did not indicate a preferred choice, and Agnew's name was not raised at this stage. Agnew was intending {{to go to the}} convention with his Maryland delegation as a favorite son, uncommitted to any of the main candidates.|$|E
5|$|BoxBoy! {{received}} a positive reception from critics. Reviewers praised the game's creative puzzles and inventive {{use of the}} box-manipulation mechanics. Some critics were pleasantly surprised {{by the amount of}} content that was offered and agreed that the package was good value for money. However, the game's simple art style was <b>divisive</b> among reviewers. A sequel, BoxBoxBoy!, was released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2016, with a third game, Bye-Bye BoxBoy!, in 2017.|$|E
5|$|Coolidge was unopposed for the Republican {{nomination}} for Governor of Massachusetts in 1918. He and his running mate, Channing Cox, a Boston lawyer and Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, {{ran on the}} previous administration's record: fiscal conservatism, a vague opposition to Prohibition, support for women's suffrage, and support for American involvement in World War I. The issue of the war proved <b>divisive,</b> especially among Irish and German Americans. Coolidge was elected {{by a margin of}} 16,773 votes over his opponent, Richard H. Long, in the smallest margin of victory of any of his statewide campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Despite a {{reputation}} as an able politician and a likable man, during his presidency Pierce served only as a moderator among the increasingly bitter factions that were driving the nation towards civil war. To Pierce, who saw slavery as a question of property rather than morality, the Union was sacred; because of this, he saw the actions of abolitionists, and the more moderate Free Soilers, as <b>divisive</b> and {{as a threat to}} the constitutionally-guaranteed rights of southerners. Although he criticized those who sought to limit or end slavery, he rarely rebuked southern politicians who took extreme position or opposed northern interests.|$|E
5|$|Geographical name {{changes in}} Turkey have been undertaken, periodically, in bulk from 1913 {{to the present}} by {{successive}} Turkish governments. Thousands of names within the Turkish Republic or the Ottoman Empire have lost or departed from their popular or historic alternatives in favour of recognizably Turkish names, {{as part of the}} Turkification policy. The governments have argued that such names are foreign and/or <b>divisive</b> against Turkish unity. Names changed were usually of Armenian, Greek, Georgian (Including Laz), Bulgarian, Kurdish, Assyrian, or Arabic origin.|$|E
5|$|Gierek government's growing {{difficulties}} led also {{to increased}} {{dependence on the}} Soviet Union, including tight economic cooperation and displays of submissiveness not seen under Gomułka's rule. The constitution, amended in February 1976, formalized the alliance with the Soviet Union and the leading role of the communist party. The language of the proposed changes was softened after protests by intellectuals and the Church, but the regime felt it needed additional authority given the indebtedness to the West and the deepening economic crisis. The <b>divisive</b> issues raised helped to coalesce the emerging circles of active political opposition.|$|E
5|$|Having {{dominated}} Zimbabwe's {{politics for}} nearly four decades, Mugabe has been a controversial and <b>divisive</b> figure. He has been praised as a revolutionary hero of the African liberation struggle who helped to free Zimbabwe from British colonialism, imperialism, and white minority rule. Conversely, he has been derided as a dictator responsible for economic mismanagement, widespread corruption, anti-white racial discrimination, human rights abuses, suppression of political critics and crimes against humanity.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the plans}} were {{abandoned}} in April 2003 {{due to the}} club {{not being able to}} raise adequate funds. Following this, plans were made to move to Kirkby, just outside the city, in a joint venture with the supermarket chain Tesco. The scheme was greatly <b>divisive</b> amongst supporters and local authorities, but was rejected in late November 2009 following a decision by Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, in {{the spirit}} of the nation's centennial celebrations, Stanton and Susan B. Anthony decided to write a more {{expansive}} history of the women's rights movement. They invited Lucy Stone to help, but Stone declined to be part of the project; she was of the opinion that Stanton and Anthony would not fairly portray the <b>divisive</b> split between NWSA and American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA). Stanton and Anthony wrote without her and, in 1881, they published the first volume of the History of Woman Suffrage, and placed themselves at each of its most important events, marginalizing Stone's contribution.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta was a <b>divisive</b> figure; {{prior to}} Kenyan independence, {{many of its}} white {{settlers}} regarded him as an agitator and malcontent, although across Africa he gained widespread respect as an anti-colonialist. During his presidency, {{he was given the}} honorary title of Mzee and lauded as the Father of the Nation. His rulership was criticised as dictatorial and authoritarian, of favouring Kikuyu over other ethnic groups, and of overseeing a growth in corruption and cronyism which have generated long-term problems for Kenya.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{agreed that}} A Link Between Worlds excelled at {{making use of}} the console's 3D capabilities. However, the game's art {{direction}} was <b>divisive</b> among critics, with some writers expressing dislike for the graphics, and others calling the visuals gorgeous. The game's music composition was complimented; Ryckert called the game's soundtrack {{one of the best}} in gaming, and Veloria thought it was some of the best in the series, praising both the new compositions and the adapted renditions music from A Link to the Past.|$|E
5|$|The Queen, {{influenced}} by the Munshi, continued to write to Lord Lansdowne {{on the issue of}} Tyler's promotion and the administration of India. She expressed reservations on the introduction of elected councils on the basis that Muslims would not win many seats because they were in the minority, and urged that Hindu feasts be re-scheduled so as not to conflict with Muslim ones. Lansdowne dismissed the latter suggestion as potentially <b>divisive,</b> but appointed Tyler Acting Inspector General of Prisons in September 1889.|$|E
5|$|The Sweet Hereafter is a 1997 Canadian drama film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Atom Egoyan, starring Ian Holm, Sarah Polley and Bruce Greenwood and adapted from the novel of the same name by Russell Banks. The film {{tells the story of a}} school bus accident in a small town that results in the deaths of numerous children. A class-action lawsuit ensues, proving <b>divisive</b> in the community and becoming tied in with personal and family issues.|$|E
5|$|The policy {{commenced}} {{during the}} final years of the Ottoman Empire and continued into the Turkish Republic. Under the Kemalist oriented government, specialized governmental commissions were created for the purpose of changing names. Approximately 28,000 topographic names were changed, which included 12,211 village and town names and 4,000 mountain, river, and other topographic names. Most name changes occurred in the eastern regions of the country where minority ethnicities form a large part or a majority of the population. Policies at times included banning the use of foreign names that were considered <b>divisive</b> and inappropriate.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of musical}} {{instruments}} in worship was a <b>divisive</b> topic within the Stone-Campbell Movement from its earliest years, when some adherents opposed the practice on scriptural grounds, while {{others may have}} relied on a cappella simply because they lacked access to musical instruments. Alexander Campbell opposed the use of instruments in worship. As early as 1855, some Restoration Movement churches were using organs or pianos, ultimately leading the Churches of Christ to separate from the groups that condoned instrumental music.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} his term, Zardari {{recorded}} abysmally low approval ratings, {{ranging from}} 11 to 14%. After the PPP was heavily defeated in the 2013 general election, Zardari became the country's first elected president to complete his constitutional term on 8 September 2013. His legacy remains <b>divisive,</b> with political observers accusing his administration of corruption and cronyism. The Zardari-led PPP continues to form the provincial government in Sindh.|$|E
5|$|Ukraine's {{present and}} future {{relationship}} with NATO has been politically <b>divisive,</b> and {{is part of a}} larger debate between Ukraine's political and cultural ties to both the European Union and Russia. It established ties to the alliance with a NATO–Ukraine Action Plan on 22 November 2002, and became the first Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) country to join NATO's Partnership for Peace initiative in February 2005. Then in April 2005, Ukraine entered into the Intensified Dialogue programme with NATO.|$|E
5|$|Widely {{considered}} one of the most significant and influential figures of the 20th century, Lenin was the posthumous subject of a pervasive personality cult within the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991. He became an ideological figurehead behind Marxism–Leninism and thus a prominent influence over the international communist movement. A controversial and highly <b>divisive</b> individual, Lenin is viewed by supporters as a champion of socialism and the working class, while critics on both the left and right emphasize his role as founder and leader of an authoritarian regime responsible for political repression and mass killings.|$|E
5|$|Among {{professional}} economists {{the revival}} of Keynesian economics has been even more <b>divisive.</b> Although many economists, such as George Akerlof, Paul Krugman, Robert Shiller, and Joseph Stiglitz, supported Keynesian stimulus, others did not believe higher government spending would help the United States economy recover from the Great Recession. Some economists, such as Robert Lucas, questioned the theoretical basis for stimulus packages. Others, like Robert Barro and Gary Becker, say that empirical evidence for beneficial effects from Keynesian stimulus does not exist. However, {{there is a growing}} academic literature that shows that fiscal expansion helps an economy grow in the near term, and that certain types of fiscal stimulus are particularly effective.|$|E
5|$|As {{a treaty}} {{document}} {{with a foreign}} nation, the Tyler-Texas annexation treaty required {{the support of a}} two-thirds majority in the Senate for passage. But in fact, when the Senate voted on the measure on June 8, 1844, fully two-thirds voted against the treaty (16–35). The vote went largely along party lines: Whigs had opposed it almost unanimously (1–27), while Democrats split, but voted overwhelmingly in favor (15–8). The election campaign had hardened partisan positions on Texas among Democrats. Tyler had anticipated that the measure would fail, due largely to the <b>divisive</b> effects of Secretary Calhoun's Packenham letter. Undeterred, he formally asked the House of Representatives to consider other constitutional means to authorize passage of the treaty. Congress adjourned before debating the matter.|$|E
5|$|Aza Arianao was {{recorded}} over {{five days in}} the summer of 2000 and released the following year. In the wake of its success, Jaojoby performed at a political rally to an audience of 50,000 partisans of candidate Marc Ravalomanana less than a month before the <b>divisive</b> 2001 presidential elections that nearly resulted in the secession of the island's coastal provinces. Jaojoby's 2004 follow-up album Malagasy, which {{was recorded}} in semi-live conditions on the island of Réunion in a small venue before an audience of the artist's friends, featured lyrics that sought to promote optimism and national reconciliation; the artist announced that he would not involve himself in national politics in the future. The same year he toured extensively in France, the United States and Canada.|$|E
5|$|Dunbar {{drops out}} of the race due to the {{discovery}} of a meeting she'd had with Goodwin {{a few days before the}} attempt on Underwood's life. Underwood begins planning to maneuver Claire into the VP spot and to use the NSA to illegally obtain voter information and spy on the Republican nominee, Will Conway (Joel Kinnaman). This happens while Underwood and Claire advocate for a controversial gun control bill for the sole purpose of creating an atmosphere <b>divisive</b> enough to weed out potential running mates. During the resulting open convention, Underwood intimidates the front-runner, Secretary of State Catherine Durant (Jayne Atkinson), into surrendering her delegates, and uses the public sympathy from Claire's mother's death to ensure that he and Claire are nominated.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Invisible War, {{multiple}} {{attempts were made to}} create a third Deus Ex title, even after both Spector and Smith left Ion Storm. The two main projects were dubbed Deus Ex: Insurrection, which used the same engine as Invisible War while moving away from its <b>divisive</b> mechanics; and Deus Ex 3, which aimed to be an open world game with a branching narrative. Prospective development on the third Deus Ex game was halted when, following further staff departure and financial difficulties, the studio's owner Eidos Interactive closed them down in 2005. A separate project developed by Crystal Dynamics, intended as the fourth Deus Ex project following Insurrection and titled Des Ex: Clan Wars, was reworked as Project Snowblind. Invisible War was the last Deus Ex game developed by Ion Storm prior to its closure.|$|E
5|$|God's Choice: The Total World of a Fundamentalist Christian School is a 1986 {{book written}} by Alan Peshkin and {{published}} by the University of Chicago Press. It {{is the product of}} his late 1970s 18-month ethnographic study of a 350-person Christian fundamentalist Baptist school in Illinois. He describes the K–12 day school's function as a total institution that educates about a singular truth (God's will) and subordination before God. The final chapter is a comparative analysis of the school and other schools, institutions, and social movements, wherein Peshkin concludes that the school is <b>divisive</b> in American society for promoting intolerance towards religious plurality, the very condition that permits the school's existence.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, in Canada, Elizabeth {{publicly}} supported politically <b>divisive</b> constitutional amendments, prompting {{criticism from}} {{opponents of the}} proposed changes, including Pierre Trudeau. The same year, the elected Fijian government was deposed in a military coup. As monarch of Fiji, Elizabeth supported the attempts of the Governor-General, Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau, to assert executive power and negotiate a settlement. Coup leader Sitiveni Rabuka deposed Ganilau and declared Fiji a republic. By the start of 1991, republican feeling in Britain had risen because of press estimates of the Queen's private wealth – which were contradicted by the Palace – and reports of affairs and strained marriages among her extended family. The involvement of younger {{members of the royal}} family in the charity game show It's a Royal Knockout was ridiculed, and the Queen was the target of satire.|$|E
5|$|In British Guiana, {{the leftist}} People's Progressive Party (PPP) {{candidate}} Cheddi Jagan won {{the position of}} chief minister in a colonially administered election in 1953, but was quickly forced to resign from power after Britain's suspension of the still-dependent nation's constitution. Embarrassed by the landslide electoral victory of Jagan's allegedly Marxist party, the British imprisoned the PPP's leadership and maneuvered the organization into a <b>divisive</b> rupture in 1955, engineering a split between Jagan and his PPP colleagues. Jagan again won the colonial elections in 1957 and 1961; despite Britain's shift to a reconsideration of its view of the left-wing Jagan as a Soviet-style communist at this time, the United States pressured the British to withhold Guyana's independence until an alternative to Jagan could be identified, supported, and brought into office.|$|E
5|$|Indiana's volunteers {{responded to}} {{requests}} for military service {{in the early months}} of the war; however, as the war progressed and the number of casualties increased, the state government had to resort to conscription (the draft) to fill its quotas. Military conscription, which began in October 1862, was a <b>divisive</b> issue within the state. It was especially unpopular among Democrats, who viewed it as a threat to individual freedom and opposed legislation that allowed a man to purchase an exemption for $300 or pay another person to serve as his substitute. A total of 3,003 Hoosier men were drafted in October 1862; subsequent drafts in Indiana brought the total to 17,903.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the songs}} on the album were written during March and April 1968 at a Transcendental Meditation course in Rishikesh, India. The group {{returned}} to EMI Studios (now known as Abbey Road Studios) in May to commence recording sessions that lasted through to October. During these sessions, arguments broke out among the Beatles, and witnesses in the studio saw band members quarrel over creative differences. Another <b>divisive</b> element was the constant presence of John Lennon's new partner, Yoko Ono, whose attendance at the sessions broke with the Beatles' policy regarding wives and girlfriends. After a series of problems, including producer George Martin taking a sudden leave of absence and engineer Geoff Emerick quitting, Ringo Starr left the band briefly in August. The same tensions continued throughout the following year, leading to the eventual break-up of the Beatles in April 1970.|$|E
