40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the issue {{regarding}} the survival, preservation of life, health and neuropsychic development of infants with extremely low birth weight. 25 preterm infants aged 0 to 4 weeks were studied. The inclusion criteria were infants aged 28 – 34 weeks of gestation, with weights ranging from 1, 000 to 1, 850 g. Enteral feeding consisted of specialized formula with prebiotics (6 hours after birth through a <b>drip</b> <b>feeding</b> tube), increasing to 150 ml/kg a day {{by the age of}} 10 – 12 days. The study results demonstrated that the maximum weight loss was recorded on day 4, 0 ± 1, 5. The original body weight was restored, on average, on day 13. The average daily weight gain was 14, 0 g/kg a day which evidenced good digestion of nutrients and high energy value of the formula. The results of lab tests showed a reduced level of nonesterified fatty acides, a slow waning of _-fetoprotein synthesis.

50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the evening McGuire acted as an intermediary and seems to have taken pleasure in his newfound power over the revered Vernon who wanted an audience with Scott. McGuire had spent the last decade trying to circle with some of the top professionals. He used his money, and his considerable knowledge, to assist other performers and constantly expand his knowledge of magic and secret sleights.However he was never able to get close to two of the best, Dai Vernon or Sam Horowitz.So McGuire got close to a magician both men admired, Max Malini, and through clever use of his association with Malini got to Horowitz.With his knowledge of Scott, McGuire had leverage and a worth to the top cardmen. For months before the June demonstration he had been giving some notes on Scott's work to Cardini.In 1931 he released a collection of manuscripts involving aspects of Scott's work which became known as The Phantom of the Card Table. Around thirty copies were released selling for as much as $50 each (approx $500 in today's currency).Through his <b>drip</b> <b>feeding</b> of notes to Horowitz and Cardini he got Vernon to start calling. McGuires replies contained nothing of value and only forced Vernon to keep writing. In the correspondence he prodded Vernon and talked up Scott's achievements and skills. It was a turnaround that McGuire must have enjoyed, now all the secretive magicians were looking to him for answers.|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} {{the presence of}} inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and to evaluate the progression of bowel involvement after two years' follow-up in seven patients affected by glycogen storage disease type Ib (GSDIb). Methods: Seven patients (5 F, 2 M, aged 4. 5 - 20. 6 y) entered the study. Bowel involvement was evaluated by ileocolonoscopy and specific IBD serologic markers. To evaluate disease activity, Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI), terminal ileum wall thickness detected at ultrasonography (US), 99 mTechnetium labelled autologous White Cell Scan (Tc-WCS) and barium meal with follow-through were investigated. Results: Ileocolonoscopy and histology examination revealed variable degrees of bowel involvement in all patients. The results of serologic markers were indicative of a Crohn's-like ileocolitis. US and Tc-WCS, could clearly define patients with severe inflammatory involvement, but failed to identify all patients with mild to moderate disease. For the most severely affected patients, anti-inflammatory agents and steroids were prescribed, whereas nutritional therapy with polymeric formula and antibiotics were assumed by two other patients and antibiotics only by one patient. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was prescribed to all patients. Ileocolonoscopy and histology data improved in all patients. The assumption of G-CSF and/or gastric <b>drip</b> <b>feeding</b> (g. d. f.) was inversely associated with the PCDAI results (p < 0. 05).

40|$|The {{nature of}} cave {{ventilation}} {{is of interest}} to cavers, speleologists, and paleoclimatologists working with stalagmites. Because cave ventilation systematics may change over the growth span of a stalagmite, understanding what factors affect them is critical for determining events that may have affected climate proxies within the stalagmite. Similarly, understanding how the hydrology of the <b>drips</b> <b>feeding</b> a stalagmite evolves through time is key to building robust records of paleoclimate, particularly because stalagmite records have become critical archives of climate change information of the last 500, 000 years. Here we present data from an extensive, on-going monitoring effort at Yok Balum Cave, Belize, initiated in 2011, that characterizes high-resolution ventilation dynamics at this site. Clear seasonal ventilation regimes exist, driven by thermally induced inside-outside air density differences. The winter regime is dominated by air inflow into the cave, decreased drawdown from the epikarst into the cave, and a limited diurnal signal. Conversely, summer ventilation is dominated by air outflow from the cave, greater CO 2 drawdown and drip water degassing, and a strong diurnal signal. Active monitoring during a large (M 7. 4) earthquake in November 2012 provides {{a unique opportunity to}} assess the response of the cave atmosphere and hydrology to substantial seismic activity. Cave atmosphere dynamics and hydrology are found to be highly resilient to seismic activity, with no observable disturbance occurring around the earthquake, despite there being considerable evidence of physical disruption in the cave. Monitoring included different kinds of drips, and the earthquake affected none of the monitored drip types. This suggests that stalagmite-derived paleoclimate records are not affected by seismic activity, except in extreme cases where the stalagmite or conjugate stalactite is damaged or reoriented...|$|R
40|$|Background: Stunted {{children}} with cystic fibrosis (CF) have less net protein anabolism than do {{children with}}out CF, {{and the result}} is retarded growth in the CF patients. It is not known whether protein intake above that recommended by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation would further stimulate whole-body protein synthesis. Objective: We studied the effects of 3 amounts of protein intake on whole-body protein synthesis and breakdown by using isotopic infusion of [1 -C- 13] valine and [N- 15 (2) ]urea in children with stable CF who required tube feeding. Design: In 8 pediatric CF patients, we administered 3 randomly allocated isocaloric diets with normal (NP), intermediate (IP), and high (HP) amounts of protein (1. 5, 3, and 5 g (.) kg(- 1) (.) d(- 1), respectively) by continuous <b>drip</b> <b>feeding</b> during a 4 -d period at 6 -wk intervals.

40|$|Grotta di Ernesto is a cave site {{well suited}} for {{palaeoclimate}} studies because it contains annually laminated stalagmites and was monitored from 1995 {{to the end of}} 2008 for microclimate, hydrology and hydrochemistry. Long-term monitoring highlighted that cave drips show three different hydrological responses to rainfall and infiltration: (1) fast seasonal drips in {{the upper part of the}} cave, which are mostly fed by fractures, (2) slow seasonal drips, located at mid-depth in the cave characterized by mixed feeding and (3) slow drips, mostly located in the deeper gallery, which are fed by seepage flow from bulk porosity with a minor fracture-fed component. The slow drips display daily cycles during spring thaw. Monitoring also indicated that drip waters are only slightly modified by degassing within the soil zone and aquifer and by prior calcite precipitation. Hydrochemical studies show a clear seasonality in calcite saturation index, which results in most cave calcite precipitation occurring during late autumn and winter with similar amounts of precipitated calcite on most stalagmites, regardless of drip rate (discharge) differences. Drip rate, and drip rate variability, therefore, has a minor role in modulating the amount of annual calcite formation. In contrast, drip rate, when associated with moderate reduction in calcite saturation index, clearly influences stalagmite morphology. Increasing drip rate yields a passage from candle-, to cone- to dome-shaped stalagmites. Very high <b>drip</b> rates <b>feed</b> speleothems with flowstone morphology. In summary, monitoring provides information about the karst aquifer and how hydrology influences those physical and chemical characteristics of speleothems which are commonly used as climate proxies...|$|R

5000|$|Harrison {{has been}} very active in the UK media, with dozens of {{newspaper}} and magazine articles, and many TV and radio interviews. Since 2005, several commentators have agreed that his predictions have consistently proved correct. As an example, in 2005 there was an almost unanimous view that the rise in house prices would moderate and that any talk of a [...] "housing bubble" [...] was both premature and indicated a false understanding of debt economics. Harrison warned {{that there would be}} a two-year explosive growth in prices and property speculation before the market imploded in the winter of 2007/08 with heavy damage to the financial markets. As shown by the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, he was essentially correct on all points. His prediction that the problems with debt economics and scaling would contribute to a worldwide economic depression has been borne out. There has been a major recession as a result of the mortgage crisis. The UK took 7 years for the growth rate in gross domestic product per head to recover to the pre-2008 peak. However, GDP remained nearly a fifth smaller than if long-term pre-crisis growth trends had continued. The costs of the depression included the rise in public debt across the western world which, in the UK case, was close to 50 per cent of GDP. Other economies recovered earlier than the UK, but they remained dependent on the <b>drip</b> <b>feed</b> of QE (quantitative easing) and near-zero interest rates; implying that self-sustaining growth had not yet returned to the advanced market economies (as at July 2015).|$|E
5000|$|Except {{for very}} large examples, {{lubrication}} {{was almost always}} manual.

[...] When the cover is screwed down tighter, grease is {{forced out of the}} bottom of the cup and into the bearing. Some early engines have just a hole in the bearing casting cap where an operator squirts lubricating oil while the engine is running. The piston is lubricated by a drip oiler that continuously <b>feeds</b> <b>drips</b> of oil onto the piston. The excess oil from the piston runs out of the cylinder onto the engine and eventually onto the ground. The drip oiler can be adjusted to drip faster or slower depending on the need for lubrication, dictated by how hard the engine is working.

40|$|Monthly in situ {{monitoring}} of the calcite deposition rate, drip-water chemistry and surrounding cave environment was carried out at Shihua Cave, Beijing, China, through two hydrological years (from January 2006 to February 2008) to determine the seasonal variability and mechanisms of stalagmite growth in Shihua Cave. Calcite deposition rates exhibit significant intra-annual variation, with the lowest values during the summer monsoonal rainy season (July-August) and peak values from autumn to spring. The temporal change in the calcite deposition rate is negatively correlated with the drip rate, cave-air PCO(2) (CO(2) partial pressure) and Ca concentration, and positively correlated with the pH of the <b>feeding</b> <b>drip</b> water. The seasonal recharge regime of drip water {{is likely to be}} the primary control on the drip-water quality and quantity, which, in turn, control the calcite deposition rate in Shihua Cave. During the summer rainy season, periodic and intense rainstorms increase the drip rate and cave-air PCO(2), leading to drip water with a lower pH and saturation index of calcite, thereby reducing the calcite precipitation. It seems that the high cave-air PCO(2) is the dominant control on the calcite deposition rate during the rainy season. Our previous study on the dissolved organic carbon of drip water concluded that the thin luminescent bands in stalagmite laminae from Shihua Cave form during the rainy season. The lower calcite deposition rate during the rainy season further supports this suggestion. The significant intra-seasonal variability of the calcite deposition rate implies that the seasonal bias of delta(18) O of stalagmites should be considered when stalagmite delta(18) O is used as a high-resolution palaeoclimatic archive...|$|R

In Exp. 1, drip loss decreased (linear, P < 0. 04) in pigs fed increasing L-carnitine. In Exp. 2, drip loss decreased (P < 0. 04) with increasing L-carnitine when fed with ractopamine. Percentage lean was higher (P < 0. 01) for pigs fed ractopamine. In Exp. 3, lean percentage increased (P < 0. 03) in pigs fed L-carnitine or ractopamine. Pigs fed L-carnitine tended (P < 0. 06) to have decreased drip loss. These results suggest that ractopamine increases carcass leanness and L-carnitine reduces drip loss when fed in combination with ractopamine. Two experiments were conducted to determine the effects of L-carnitine and ractopamine on the metabolic response to handling. Non-gentle handling increased (P < 0. 01) lactate and rectal temperature, and decreased pH. In Exp. 1, non-gentle handled pigs fed ractopamine had decreased (P < 0. 01) pH and increased temperature and tended (P < 0. 09) to have higher lactate than other pigs. In Exp. 2, lactate and temperature changes from immediately post-handling to 1 h post-handling were not different for pigs fed L-carnitine or ractopamine suggesting that L-carnitine did not decrease recovery time of pigs subjected to non-gentle handling or fed ractopamine. These results suggest that pigs fed ractopamine are more susceptible to stress when handled aggressively. Because carnitine did not alleviate the negative effects of handling for pigs fed ractopamine, the improvement in <b>drip</b> loss from <b>feeding</b> carnitine must be due to a different mode of action...|$|R
