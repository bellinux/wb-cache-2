40|$|OBJECTIVES: (1) To {{compare the}} effect of two {{different}} intra-oral <b>image</b> <b>receptors</b> on estimates of fractal dimension; and (2) to determine the variations in fractal dimensions between the femur, tibia and humerus of the rat and between their proximal, middle and distal regions. METHODS: The left femur, tibia and humerus from 24 4 - 6 -month-old Sprague-Dawley rats were radiographed using intra-oral film and a charge-coupled device (CCD). Films were digitized at a pixel density comparable to the CCD using a flat-bed scanner. Square regions of interest were selected from proximal, middle, and distal regions of each bone. Fractal dimensions were estimated from the slope of regression lines fitted to plots of log power against log spatial frequency. RESULTS: The fractal dimensions estimates from digitized films were significantly greater than those produced from the CCD (P= 0. 0008). Estimated fractal dimensions of three types of bone {{were not significantly different}} (P= 0. 0544); however, the three regions of bones were significantly different (P= 0. 0239). The fractal dimensions estimated from radiographs of the proximal and distal regions of the bones were lower than comparable estimates obtained from the middle region. CONCLUSIONS: Different types of <b>image</b> <b>receptors</b> significantly affect estimates of fractal dimension.

50|$|Although {{the product}} of tube current and {{exposure}} time, measured in milliampere-seconds (mA·s), is the primary controlling factor of radiographic density, kVp also affects the radiographic density indirectly.

Scatter is unwanted density (that is, density created without bringing any pertinent information to the <b>image</b> <b>receptor).</b> This is why kVp is not primarily used to control density - as the density resulting from increasing kVp passes what is needed to penetrate a part, it will only add useless information to the image.|$|E

Basic technical parameters of the X-ray tube and generator, processing, image quality, and patient doses in 20 mammographic units were studied. The survey demonstrated considerable variations in technical parameters that affect image quality, and patients doses.
