5|$|Although the edibility of M.frustrata was not {{mentioned}} in the original description, Kuo has elsewhere written of the edibility of North American Morchella. In general, morels should not be eaten raw, as they can trigger allergic reactions in susceptible individuals. Their <b>flavor</b> <b>is</b> enhanced after they are fried, stuffed, or dried.|$|E
25|$|Kabusecha Similar to gyokuro, kabusecha is shaded {{for only}} a week prior to plucking. Its <b>flavor</b> <b>is</b> {{somewhat}} between that of gyokuro and normal sencha.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} [...] "Lightning Lemonade" [...] <b>flavor</b> <b>was</b> discontinued in {{the year}} 2000. However, in 2005 the <b>flavor</b> <b>was</b> re-introduced as LeBron's Lightning Lemonade, based on a partnership between Bubblicious and basketball player LeBron James. The caricature featured on the packaging was illustrated by cartoonist Grey Blackwell. When the <b>flavor</b> <b>was</b> re-introduced, it was changed to include a raspberry flavor element.|$|R
25|$|The blood orange, {{with its}} {{distinct}} color and <b>flavor,</b> <b>is</b> generally considered favorably as a juice, and {{has found a}} niche as an ingredient variation in traditional Seville marmalade.|$|E
25|$|The {{flavor of}} black {{truffles}} {{is far less}} pungent and more refined than that of white truffles. Their strong <b>flavor</b> <b>is</b> often described as syrupy sweet. Black truffles also are used for producing truffle salt and truffle honey.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that gum <b>flavor</b> <b>is</b> {{perceived}} better {{in the presence of}} sweetener. Companies have started to create chemical systems in gum so that the sweetener and flavor release together in a controlled manner during chewing.|$|E
5000|$|Fresca {{packaging}} {{has been}} redesigned several times, although advertising continues to emphasize sophistication. In 2005, Coca-Cola gave Fresca a more contemporary look, Fresca's first makeover since 1995. During this redesign, two new <b>flavors</b> <b>were</b> introduced (Sparkling Peach Citrus and Sparkling Black Cherry Citrus) {{and the original}} grapefruit <b>flavor</b> <b>was</b> renamed Sparkling Citrus. Later, [...] "Sparkling" [...] was dropped and the original <b>flavor</b> <b>was</b> renamed Original Citrus. Several additional <b>flavors</b> have <b>been</b> added to the line-up since 2005.|$|R
50|$|Stride was {{available}} only in the United States until January 2008, when the Spearmint, Sweet Peppermint and Forever Fruit <b>flavors</b> <b>were</b> made available in Canada. Most <b>flavors</b> <b>are</b> now available in Canada.|$|R
50|$|Flavors (and its {{successor}} New <b>Flavors)</b> <b>was</b> {{the object}} {{system on the}} MIT Lisp Machine. Large parts of the Lisp Machine operating systems and many applications for it use Flavors or New Flavors. Flavors introduced multiple inheritance and mixins, amongst other features. <b>Flavors</b> <b>is</b> mostly obsolete, though implementations for Common Lisp do exist. <b>Flavors</b> <b>was</b> using the message passing paradigm. New Flavors introduced generic functions.|$|R
25|$|The wine {{has been}} {{described}} as 'velvety' or 'unctuous'. The characteristic fruit <b>flavor</b> <b>is</b> plum, sometimes tending towards prune. According to wine expert Oz Clarke, Pomerols can have, in addition to the characteristic plum notes, honeyed spice, truffles, peppermint, chocolate, roasted nuts and raisin notes with a creamy, sometimes buttery mouthfeel and supple tannins.|$|E
25|$|A heavy-ion {{collision}} is {{in neither}} the thermodynamic limit of large volumes nor long times. Putting aside questions {{of whether it}} is sufficiently equilibrated for thermodynamics to be applicable, there is certainly not enough time for weak interactions to occur, so <b>flavor</b> <b>is</b> conserved, and there are independent chemical potentials for all six quark flavors. The initial conditions (the impact parameter of the collision, the number of up and down quarks in the colliding nuclei, {{and the fact that}} they contain no quarks of other flavors) determine the chemical potentials. (Reference for this section:,).|$|E
25|$|Heritage turkeys {{have been}} praised by chefs and food critics alike as being richer in flavor than {{industrial}} birds, though {{the lack of}} a large amount of breast meat means cooking times and methods may differ substantially from non-heritage birds. Heritage turkeys are closer in taste to wild turkeys, but are several pounds larger. Part of this stated increase in <b>flavor</b> <b>is</b> due to a difference in the maturity between industrial turkeys and heritage ones - if birds are slaughtered at less than four months old, they fail to ever accrue fat layers.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} <b>flavors</b> <b>were</b> Red, Green and Blue. Under Beatrice Foods, these flavors became Strawberry, Apple and Grape. For April Fools' Day 1983, three special <b>flavors</b> <b>were</b> released: Broiled Salmon, Chicken-Fried Steak and Huevos Rancheros.|$|R
50|$|In Indonesia, Multi Bintang {{produces}} a non/low alcohol flavored beer named Bintang Radler, which {{is produced in}} grapefruit and lemon flavors. The grapefruit <b>flavor</b> <b>was</b> introduced in 2015 and the lemon <b>flavor</b> <b>was</b> introduced in February 2016.|$|R
5000|$|Flavored: mate cocido {{to which}} an {{additional}} <b>flavor</b> has <b>been</b> applied. Some <b>flavors</b> <b>are</b> lemon, peach, vanilla, orange and tangerine.|$|R
25|$|The golden kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis) has a smooth, bronze skin, with a beak shape at {{the stem}} attachment. Flesh color varies from bright green to a clear, intense yellow. This species is sweeter and more {{aromatic}} in flavor; the <b>flavor</b> <b>is</b> reminiscent of some subtropical fruit. Its short storage life currently limits its commercial potential. One {{of the most}} attractive varieties has a red 'iris' around {{the center of the}} fruit and yellow flesh outside. The yellow fruit fetches a higher market price and, being less hairy than the fuzzy kiwifruit, is more palatable for consumption without peeling.|$|E
25|$|Coffee is best {{stored in}} an {{airtight}} container made of ceramic, glass, or non-reactive metal. Higher quality prepackaged coffee usually has a one-way valve which prevents air from entering while allowing the coffee to release gases. Coffee freshness and <b>flavor</b> <b>is</b> preserved when it is stored away from moisture, heat, and light. The ability of coffee to absorb strong smells from food means that it should be kept away from such smells. Storage of coffee in the refrigerator is not recommended due to the presence of moisture which can cause deterioration. Exterior walls of buildings which face the sun may heat the interior of a home, and this heat may damage coffee stored near such a wall. Heat from nearby ovens also harms stored coffee.|$|E
25|$|Butter fills several {{roles in}} baking, {{where it is}} used {{in a similar manner}} as other solid fats like lard, suet, or shortening, but has a flavor that may better {{complement}} sweet baked goods. Many cookie doughs and some cake batters are leavened, at least in part, by creaming butter and sugar together, which introduces air bubbles into the butter. The tiny bubbles locked within the butter expand in the heat of baking and aerate the cookie or cake. Some cookies like shortbread may have no other source of moisture but the water in the butter. Pastries like pie dough incorporate pieces of solid fat into the dough, which become flat layers of fat when the dough is rolled out. During baking, the fat melts away, leaving a flaky texture. Butter, because of its <b>flavor,</b> <b>is</b> a common choice for the fat in such a dough, but it can be more difficult to work with than shortening because of its low melting point. Pastry makers often chill all their ingredients and utensils while working with a butter dough.|$|E
5000|$|Limited Edition:These <b>flavors</b> <b>are</b> (or have been) {{available}} as [...] "Limited Time Only" [...] or [...] "Seasonal" [...] products in 8-quantity boxes; {{all of these}} <b>flavors</b> <b>were</b> first introduced after the 2013 acquisition of Hostess by Apollo Global Management.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{they were}} not labeled sugar-free, four <b>flavors</b> <b>were</b> {{considered}} [...] "Mid-Calorie": Twisted Lime, Watermelon, Tangerine, and Blueberry. These <b>flavors</b> <b>were</b> sweetened with Splenda, but still included 21 grams of sugar (compared to approximately 45-50 grams in the regular sodas).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Fragrance and <b>flavor</b> <b>are</b> {{valuable}} {{ingredients in}} toiletries, cosmetics and foods. They {{play a very}} important role in these products. However, fragrances and <b>flavors</b> <b>are</b> complex mixtures of comparatively volatile substances and labile components of which the sensory perception can be changed as a result of heating, oxidation, chemical interactions or volatilization. Microencapsulation technology is an effective method to minimize the harm of these problems. Encapsulation of fragrances or <b>flavors</b> has <b>been</b> attempted using various methods. In this paper, the chemical and engineering processes for encapsulation of fragrance and <b>flavor</b> <b>are</b> discussed. The different coating materials and their application are depicted...|$|R
500|$|Martin {{offered the}} {{following}} hint {{as to how}} the series would conclude during a Q at the Guadalajara International Book Fair. [...] "I'm {{not going to tell you}} how I'm going to end my book, but I suspect the overall <b>flavor</b> <b>is</b> going to be as much bittersweet as it is happy." ...|$|E
500|$|Coprinellus micaceus is an edible species, {{and cooking}} inactivates the enzymes that cause autodigestion or deliquescenceâa {{process that can}} begin {{as soon as one}} hour after collection. It is {{considered}} ideal for omelettes, and as a flavor for sauces, although it is [...] "a very delicate species easily spoiled by overcooking". The <b>flavor</b> <b>is</b> so delicate that it is easy to overpower and hide with almost anything. The fungus also appeals to fruit flies of the genus Drosophila, who frequently use the fruit bodies as hosts for larvae production.|$|E
500|$|Although it {{has been}} called a [...] "sentimental favorite" [...] at farmers' markets, it is not {{expected}} to become a major commercial variety because its <b>flavor</b> <b>is</b> not as neutral as more popular grapes, such as Thompson Seedless, Crimson Seedless, or Flame Seedless. [...] However, Ramming predicted that it would become a specialty item, much like the Muscat varieties, due to its distinctive, Concord-like flavor. [...] Because of its strong reception at farmers' markets, it could compete with Concord and Niabell varieties in eastern markets, according to Ramming.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, Necco {{changed the}} formula for its Necco Wafers. Artificial colors and <b>flavors</b> <b>were</b> eliminated. The candy was made softer through the {{addition}} of glycerine. The lime <b>flavor</b> <b>was</b> removed due to difficulties in creating an all-natural green coloring, resulting in a 7-flavor Necco Wafer roll.|$|R
50|$|Not all <b>flavors</b> <b>are</b> {{available}} at all venues.|$|R
50|$|The Slurpee {{machine has}} a {{separate}} spout for each flavor {{at the front}} of a tumbler or freezer, where patrons pour their own Slurpees. When Slurpees were first introduced, the dispensing machine was located behind the counter, and the clerk was tasked with dispensing the product. Common <b>flavors</b> <b>are</b> frozen Cherry, Coke, and Mountain Dew. But new <b>flavors</b> <b>are</b> introduced regularly. In the Slurpee's early history, flavors rotated much more frequently than today. Slurpee <b>flavors</b> <b>were</b> given novelty names such as Pink Fink, Adults Only, Moonshine, Kissin' Cousin, Gully Washer, Sticky Icky, and Redeye.|$|R
500|$|Its aromatic, [...] "labrusca" [...] <b>flavor</b> <b>is</b> {{similar to}} that of Concord, but mellowed by the mild, sweet taste from Thompson Seedless. [...] Thomcord grows well in hot, dry climates, ripens between late July and mid-August, and tolerates powdery mildew. [...] It is a {{productive}} variety, yielding an average of [...] of grapes per vine, but has produced as much as [...] per vine in grower trials. [...] The berries weigh between [...] and have a medium-thick, blue-black skin that adheres to the fruit, unlike Concord, which has a thick skin that can slip off the pulp easily. [...] The aborted seeds in the fruit body are relatively small, but larger than those in Thompson Seedless.|$|E
500|$|Streisand's {{version of}} [...] "Guava Jelly" [...] divided music critics. A writer for Billboard was {{enthusiastic}} of the release, writing, [...] "Barbra takes the great Bob Marley reggae cut and commercializes it somewhat, though the <b>flavor</b> <b>is</b> still there. Good soulful backup and reggae type organ help make this an almost certain bet for heavy top 40 play". Author Derek Winnert referred to Streisand's version as a [...] "success" [...] in his 1996 book Barbra Streisand. However, an editor for Boating disliked Streisand's version and urged {{the public to}} [...] "ignore" [...] it, joking that it [...] "does not belong in [...] our stateroom". A reviewer from Broadcasting disliked everything about her version, stating, [...] "The Streisand voice and name alone might be {{enough to make a}} hit out of any of her single releases, but with the first single from her best-selling ButterFly album, the singer is taking no chances." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{hedgehog}} mushroom {{is considered}} to be a good edible, having a sweet, nutty taste and a crunchy texture. Some consider it the culinary equivalent of the chanterelle. Author Michael Kuo gives it an edibility rating of [...] "great" [...] and notes that there are no poisonous lookalikes, and that they are unlikely to be infested with maggots. Delicately brushing the cap and stipe of specimens immediately after harvest will help prevent soil from getting lodged between the teeth. Hydnum repandum mushrooms can be cooked by pickling, simmering in milk or stock, and sautÃ©eing, which creates a [...] "tender, meaty texture and a mild flavor." [...] The mushroom tissue absorbs liquids well and assumes the flavors of added ingredients. The firm texture of the cooked mushroom makes it suitable for freezing. Its natural <b>flavor</b> <b>is</b> reportedly similar to the peppery taste of watercress, or oysters. Older specimens may have a bitter taste, but boiling can remove the bitterness. Specimens found under conifers can taste [...] "unpleasantly strong". The form amarum, locally common in Slovakia, is reportedly inedible because its fruit body has a bitter taste at all developmental stages.|$|E
50|$|Implementations of <b>Flavors</b> <b>are</b> also {{available}} for Common Lisp.|$|R
50|$|Likewise in 2011, Milk-aji, or Milk <b>Flavor</b> <b>was</b> established.|$|R
50|$|There <b>are</b> many <b>flavors</b> of UmaibÅ available, {{including}} savory flavors, such as salad, mentaiko, takoyaki and cheese; {{and sweet}} flavors, such as cocoa, caramel, and chocolate. Some <b>flavors</b> <b>were</b> discontinued {{after a brief}} period, while others became a staple. Some <b>flavors</b> <b>are</b> only sold in specific locations, such as tourist spots.|$|R
