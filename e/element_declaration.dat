40|$|Abstract: There is an {{emerging}} amount of software for generating and manipulating XML documents. This paper addresses {{the problem of}} guaranteeing the validity of dynamically generated XML structures statically at compile time of an XML-based application. In the XOBE (XML OBJECTS) project we extend the object-oriented programming language Java by new language constructs. XML Schema is used for describing sets of valid XML documents. An XML schema provides a vehicle to define new classes, i. e. each <b>element</b> <b>declaration</b> in a schema defines {{a new class of}} objects (XML objects). Each object within a class represents an XML structure which is valid according to the underlying XML schema. XML objects are created by a new language construct called XML object constructor. XML object constructors are expressed in XML syntax. Previously generated XML objects can be inserted according to the declared XML schema. The main focus of the paper is the type system of XOBE. Among others, this type system provides the basis for checking the validity of assignments of XML objects to variables. The type system will be described and we present formally a type checking algorithm based on this type system. ...|$|E
50|$|DTDs {{describe}} {{the structure of}} a class of documents via <b>element</b> and attribute-list <b>declarations.</b> <b>Element</b> <b>declarations</b> name the allowable set of elements within the document, and specify whether and how declared elements and runs of character data may be contained within each <b>element.</b> Attribute-list <b>declarations</b> name the allowable set of attributes for each declared element, including the type of each attribute value, if not an explicit set of valid values.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Element</b> <b>declarations,</b> which define {{properties}} of elements. These include the element name and target namespace. An important property {{is the type}} of the element, which constrains what attributes and children the element can have. In XSD 1.1, the type of the element may be conditional on the values of its attributes. An element may belong to a substitution group; if element E is in the substitution group of element H, then wherever the schema permits H to appear, E may appear in its place. Elements may have integrity constraints: uniqueness constraints determining that particular values must be unique within the subtree rooted at an element, and referential constraints determining that values must match the identifier of some other <b>element.</b> <b>Element</b> <b>declarations</b> may be global or local, allowing the same name to be used for unrelated elements in different parts of an instance document.|$|R

The SML specification defines model concepts, and the SML-IF specification describes a packaging format for exchanging SML-based models.|$|R
50|$|Most XML schema {{languages}} are only replacements for <b>element</b> <b>declarations</b> and attribute list declarations, {{in such a}} way that it becomes possible to parse XML documents with non-validating XML parsers (if the only purpose of the external DTD subset was to define the schema). In addition, documents for these XML schema languages must be parsed separately, so validating the schema of XML documents in pure standalone mode is not really possible with these languages: the document type declaration remains necessary for at least identifying (with a XML Catalog) the schema used in the parsed XML document and that is validated in another language.|$|R

Unlike other approaches, XACT provides a programming model based on XML templates and XPath together with a type checker based on data-flow analysis. We show how to extend the data-flow analysis technique used in the XACT system to support XML Schema as type formalism. The technique is able to model advanced features, such as type derivations and overloaded local <b>element</b> <b>declarations,</b> and also datatypes of attribute values and character data. Moreover, we introduce optional type annotations to improve modularity of the type checking. The resulting system supports a flexible style of programming XML transformations and provides static guarantees of validity of the generated XML data...|$|R

The annotation model, both in Java and in C#, limits annotations to classes and class members. In this paper we describe [a]C # a, an extension of the C# programming language, that allows programmers to annotate statements and code blocks and retrieve these annotations at run-time. We show how this extension can be reduced to the existing model. A set of operations on annotated code blocks to retrieve annotations and manipulate bytecode is introduced. We also discuss how to use [a]C# to annotate programs giving hints on how to parallelize a sequential method and how it can be implemented by means of the abstractions provided by the run-time of the language. Finally, we show how our model for custom attributes has been realized...|$|R
40|$|On an {{abstract}} level, XML Schema increases the limited expressive power of Document Type Definitions (DTDs) by extending {{them with a}} recursive typing mechanism. However, {{an investigation of the}} XML Schema Definitions (XSDs) occurring in practice reveals {{that the vast majority of}} them are structurally equivalent to DTDs. This might be due to the complexity of the XML Schema specification and the difficulty to understand the effect of constraints on typing and validation of schemas. To shed some light on the actual expressive power of XSDs this paper studies the impact of the <b>Element</b> <b>Declarations</b> Consistent (EDC) and the Unique Particle Attribution (UPA) rule. An equivalent formalism based on contextual patterns rather than on recursive types is proposed which might serve as a light-weight front end for XML Schema. Finally, the effect of EDC and UPA on the way XML documents can be typed is discussed. It is argued that a cleaner, more robust, stronger but equally efficient class is obtained by replacing EDC and UPA with the notion of 1 -pass preorder typing: schemas that allow to determine the type of an element of a streaming document when its opening tag is met. This notion can be defined in terms of restrained competition regular expressions and there is again an equivalent syntactical formalism based on contextual patterns...|$|R
40|$|In Java programs, {{classes are}} coupled {{to each other}} through the use of typed references. In order to {{minimize}} coupling without changing the executed code, interfaces can be introduced for every <b>declaration</b> <b>element</b> such that each interface contains only those members that are actually needed from the objects referenced by that element. While these interfaces can be automatically computed using type inference, concerns have been raised that rigorous application of this principle would increase the number of types in a program to levels beyond manageability. It should be clear that decoupling is required only in selected places and no one would seriously introduce a minimal interface for every <b>declaration</b> <b>element</b> in a program. Nevertheless we have investigated the actual cost of so doing (counted as the number of new types required) by applying rigorous decoupling to a number of open source Java projects, and contrasted it with the benefit, measured in terms of reduced overall coupling. Our results suggest that (a) fewer new interfaces are needed than one might believe and (b) that a small number of new interfaces accounts for a large number of <b>declaration</b> <b>elements.</b> Particularly the latter means that automated derivation of decoupling interfaces may at times be useful, if the number of new interfaces is limited a priori to the popular ones...|$|R
40|$|The common {{abstraction}} of XML Schema by unranked regular tree languages is {{not entirely}} accurate. To {{shed some light on}} the actual expressive power of XML Schema, intuitive semantical characterizations of the <b>Element</b> <b>Declarations</b> Consistent (EDC) rule are provided. In particular, it is obtained that schemas satisfying EDC can only reason about regular properties of ancestors of nodes. Hence, w. r. t. expressive power, XML Schema is closer to DTDs than to tree automata. These theoretical results are complemented with an investigation of the XML Schema Definitions (XSDs) occurring in practice, revealing that the extra expressiveness of XSDs over DTDs is only used to a very limited extent. As this might be due to the complexity of the XML Schema specification and the difficulty to understand the effect of constraints on typing and validation of schemas, a simpler formalism equivalent to XSDs is proposed. It is based on contextual patterns rather than on recursive types and it might serve as a light-weight front end for XML Schema. Next, the effect of EDC on the way XML documents can be typed is discussed. It is argued that a cleaner, more robust, larger but equally feasible class is obtained by replacing EDC with the notion of 1 -pass preorder typing (1 PPT) : schemas that allow to determine the type of an element of a streaming document when its opening tag is met.

Functions of trees, located in the countryside and in the urban area, are defined in the introductory section. The part following deals with {{the historical development of}} tree protection, and is divided into forest conservation and trees outside forests. Wood plants growing outside of the forests are further described in terms of their protection, permitted felling and legally compulsory replacement planting, in accordance with applicable law. A substantial part of the thesis is dedicated to memorable trees. Firstly, the significance of memorable trees is presented and the current state is being compared with the past, further on, the record memorable trees in our country are mentioned. In accordance to legal rules, legal and contractual protection is specified, essential <b>elements,</b> concerning <b>declaration</b> of memorable trees, their registration and annulment. A tree care, also subjected to legislation, is aimed at preservative tree care, cut trees and tree ties. For each type of care, treatment methods or tools are described. In the context of protection of memorable trees, the project of rescuing the gene pool of memorable trees is also mentioned and then the memorable trees abroad are briefly described. The protected landscape, in which the revision took place, is briefly described in the context of its geological past and represented fauna and flora. Then the description of small protected areas of the region follows. Then the revision of memorable trees was performed, including measurements of dendrometic parameters, for example determining the height of the tree, its perimeter, width and height of the crown. Futhermore, the treatment of each tree was summerized according to Central list of nature protection, and photographic documentation of each individual at the time of foliage and without foliage was taken to understand the habitus of the tree. The results are used to update the parameters in the Central list of nature protection and suggested treatments are the basis for the future care of the memorable trees. The results showed that the the most common species is Tilia cordata. Trees are generally in a good health, but a regularity of treatment is necessary...|$|R
40|$|Diese Diplomarbeit wurde von Miriam Anne Frank verfasst und trägt den Titel „DER KAMPF UM DIE GLOBALEN RECHTE INDIGENER VÖLKER. Bericht einer Ethnologin über die Entstehung der Deklaration der Vereinten Nationen für die Rechte Indigener Völker. “ Sie besteht aus insgesamt 116 Seiten und wurde am 29. Oktober 2008 abgeschlossen und eingereicht. Die Diplomarbeit untersucht den Entstehungsprozess der Deklaration der Vereinten Nationen für die Rechte Indigener Völker, mit dem die Internationale Bewegung Indigener Völker die globalisierte Arena der Vereinten Nationen betrat. Dabei wurde hervorgehoben, dass die indigenen Repräsentaten, die auf dieser Ebene arbeiteten, stets auch ihre regionale Perspektiven vertraten. Sie hielten engen Kontakt zu ihren lokalen, nationalen und regionalen Gruppen und Organisationen und agierten auf diese Weise nie in einem globalen Vakuum. In meiner Arbeit habe ich versucht, auf Grund jahrelanger eingehender Forschungen und meiner Beteiligung als Aktivistin, sowohl die politischen Anliegen wie auch die Arbeitsprozesse, die dieser Deklaration zugrundeliegen, nachzuvollziehen. Dabei folgte ich der Vorgabe der „dichten Beschreibung“ (Clifford Geertz). Auch versuchte ich, dem Leser einen direkten Einblick in die Arbeitsweise des Global Indigenous Peoples’ Caucus zu vermitteln, mit dem ich als NGO-Aktivistin eng zusammenarbeitete. Die Diplomarbeit bestand aus folgenden Hauptkapiteln: 1) Danksagung und Widmungen, 2) Die Entwicklung meines persönlichen Engagements mit dem Diplomarbeitsthema, 3) Methodologie, 4) Schlüsselbegriff “Indigene Voelker”, 5) Die Deklaration der Vereinten Nationen für die Rechte Indigener Völker, 6) Selbstbestimmung, 7) Beginn und Entwicklung des Engagements der Indigenen Völker bei der UN von 1923 zu 1977, 8) Die UN Arbeitsgruppe für Indigene Völker 9) Der Caucus der Indigenen Völker, 10) Der lange Weg von der Formulierung bis zur Annahme der Deklaration, 11) Die UN Generalversammlung verabschiedet die Deklaration, 12) Die globalisierte internationale Indigenenbewegung, und 13) Persönliches Fazit. Die von mir angewandte Methode war die der teilnehmenden Beobachtung, einschließlich einer Feldforschung, die hauptsächlich auf verschiedenen Tagungen der Vereinten Nationen zum Gegenstand der Deklaration betrieben wurde. Um direkte Informationen zu sammeln, führte ich über Jahre eine Anzahl von Interviews, ursprünglich mit Mitgliedern der internationalen Indigenenbewegung und schliesslich mit Vorstandsmitgliedern des Global Indigenous Peoples’ Caucus unmittelbar nach der Annahme der Deklaration. Weiterhin benutzte ich Literatur, zunächst konzentierte ich mich auf die begrenzte Literatur an Büchern und später auf die zunehmende Anzahl von Artikeln in anthropologischen Zeitschriften, die seither zu diesem Thema wie auch anderen, in engem Zusammenhang damit stehenden Themen erschienen sind. Obwohl ich in meiner Annäherung an meinen Forschungsgegenstand zuerst einem eher formalen Ansatz folgte, erlaubte ich mir, je länger und intensiver ich in diesen Prozess und die internationale Indigenenbewegung verwickelt war, meine eigenen Erfahrungen und Beobachtungen einfließen zu lassen. Dies führte am Ende zu einem wesentlich deutlicheren Fokus, aus dem ich die Dynamik dieser Bewegung, die sich um die Erklärung gebildet hatte, genauer ins Auge fassen konnte, denn ich hatte miterlebt, wie sich die Bewegung von einer ad hoc Versammlung in ein hoch organisiertes politisches Gremium indigener Völker entwickelte. Während dieses jahrelangen dynamischen und hochkomplizierten UN-Prozesses eignete ich mir allmählich die Sichtweise eines Insiders an, die ich als mein wichtigstes persönliches Forschungsergebnis betrachte. Ein weiteres Hauptergebnis war die Untersuchung der Global Indigenous Peoples’ Caucus und die Feststellung, dass dieses Gremium ein definitives Beispiel für „Graswurzel-Globalisierung“ oder „Globalisierung von unten“ darstellt. (Begriffsprägungen des Anthropologen Arjun Appaduri). Mit meiner Arbeit hoffe ich einen positiven Beitrag zur Anthropologie der Menschenrechte und zu transnationalen Prozessen am Schnittpunkt zwischen Anthropologie, Rechtswissenschaft und Politikwissenschaft geleistet zu haben. This thesis {{was written}} by Miriam Anne Frank and is {{entitled}} “FIGHTING FOR GLOBAL INDIGENOUS PEOPLES’ RIGHTS. An anthropologist's account of how the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples came into being”. It comprises a total of 116 pages and was completed and turned in for submission on 29 October 2008. 	 This thesis examines the fact that although the international Indigenous peoples’ movement has, within this process around the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (Declaration) entered into the globalized arena of the United Nations, Indigenous peoples’ representatives working at this level still carry forward very regionally-driven perspectives. They continue to maintain close ties with their local, national and regional constituents and as such are never working in a global vacuum. Via this thesis, I hope to have captured, based on years of intimate, activist research, both {{the process and the}} political issues surrounding the Declaration. This following along the lines of what Clifford Geertz has termed ‘thick description’. Most importantly, I hope to have provided the reader with direct insight into the workings of the Global Indigenous Peoples’ Caucus, with whom I worked with directly via my position as an NGO activist. In regards to thesis’ structure, it begins by introducing the the reader to my personal involvement with the thesis topic and the methodology I employed. It then presents some essential elements including the introduction to “Indigenous peoples”, the “United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples”, and the issue of “Self-Determination”, which for Indigenous peoples is the cornerstone <b>element</b> of the <b>Declaration.</b> 					 I next cover the historical development of the international Indigenous peoples’ movement, from its very beginnings, {{to the development of the}} International Labour Organization’s conventions for Indigenous peoples, to the seminal United Nations study of Indigenous peoples - the Martínez Cobo Report, the first UN conference on Indigenous peoples, and finally the establishment of the first United Nation’s body for Indigenous peoples, the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations. 	 The next sections cover the bodies and processes as the Declaration climbed up the UN ladder, including the UN Working Group on the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the UN Commission on Human Rights, the UN Human Rights Council, the 3 rd Committee of the UN General Assembly, and finally the Declaration’s arrival and adoption by the UN General Assembly. Within these sections I put forward the work of the Indigenous peoples, especially that of the Global International Indigenous Peoples’ Caucus and it’s Steering Committee. In fact, this specific body became the main focus of my research interest, as a prime example of what Anthropologist Arjun Appadurai had coined ‚grassroots globalization’ or ‚globalization from below’ movements. Next, I devote what I consider to be a main section of this thesis to the globalized Indigenous peoples’ movement. I firstly briefly address the impact that globalized technology, such as the internet, has had on this movement. In the following chapter I go into much more depth, using the rich source that the main interviews I conducted with members of the Global Indigenous Peoples’ Caucus Steering Committee provided. In the final chapter, I round out my thesis with a personal conclusion, which includes my assessment of having conducted activist research and ends with a proposal on how, with the Declaration adopted, anthropologists can best contribute to making it a living document. 		 The methodology I employed was a combination of participant/observation research, including multi-sited field research, conducted primarily at the United Nations meetings focussing on the Declaration. In regards to the collection of direct data, I held a series of interviews over the years, initially with members of the global Indigenous peoples’ movement in general, and eventually with members of the Steering Committee of the Global International Indigenous Peoples’ Caucus just after the Declaration’s adoption. Further, I conducted literary research, at first concentrated on the limited literature available in books, to in the end working with many articles from anthropology journals, which by this time were increasingly publishing articles on this topic, as well as on other closely related areas. 		 In terms of my approach to my research topic, although I initially had a more formal approach, with a clear set of questions and focus, in the course of my ever increasing involvement with this process and the international Indigenous peoples’ movement, I allowed my experience and observations to shape my research. This in the end led to a much clearer focus in which I chose to look more closely at the dynamics of this movement around the Declaration, having seen it evolve from an ad-hoc gathering into a highly organized political body of Indigenous peoples. Finally, in regard to the results of this research, I see this thesis as being able to provide a completely insider perspective to a very complicated UN process - what from an outsider standpoint may seem like a very dry topic, more of interest to legal and political scholars. As such, I believe to have positively contributed to the anthropology of human rights and transnational processes as I emphasized, at the forefront of my research, the social agency and global processes that cut across the fields of anthropology, law and political science...|$|R
