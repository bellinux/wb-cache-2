5000|$|<b>Escape</b> response, <b>escape</b> reaction, or <b>escape</b> {{behaviour}} is {{a possible}} reaction in response to stimuli indicative of danger. In particular, it initiates an <b>escape</b> motion of an animal. In the cases of reflectory reactions, the <b>escape</b> response may also be called an <b>escape</b> reflex.|$|R

40|$|Successful {{predator}} evasion {{is essential}} to the fitness of many animals. Variation in <b>escape</b> behaviour may be adaptive as it reduces predictability, enhancing <b>escape</b> success. High <b>escape</b> velocities and accelerations also increase <b>escape</b> success, but biomechanical factors likely constrain the behavioural range over which performance can be maximized. There may therefore be a trade-off between variation and performance during <b>escape</b> responses. We have used bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) <b>escape</b> responses to examine this potential trade-off, determining the full repertoire of <b>escape</b> behaviour for individual bluegill sunfish and linking this to performance as indicated by <b>escape</b> velocity and acceleration. Fish <b>escapes</b> involve an initial C-bend of the body axis, followed by variable steering movements. These generate thrust and establish the <b>escape</b> direction. Directional changes during the initial C-bend were less variable than the final <b>escape</b> angle, and the most frequent directions were associated with high <b>escape</b> velocity. Significant inter-individual differences in <b>escape</b> angles magnified the overall variation, maintaining unpredictability from a predator perspective. Steering in the latter stages of the <b>escape</b> to establish the final <b>escape</b> trajectory also affected performance, with turns away from the stimulus associated with reduced velocity. This suggests that modulation of <b>escape</b> behaviour by steering may also have an associated performance cost. This has important implications for understanding the scope and control of intra- and inter-individual variation in <b>escape</b> behaviour and the associated costs and benefits...|$|R
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, maroons came to live in the Great Dismal Swamp. Most settled on mesic islands, the high and dry parts of the swamp. Inhabitants included slaves who had purchased their freedom as well as <b>escaped</b> slaves. Other <b>escaped</b> slaves used the swamp as a route on the Underground Railroad {{as they made their way}} further north. Some slaves lived there in semi-free conditions, but how much independence slaves actually enjoyed there has been a topic of much debate. Nearby whites often left enslaved maroons alone so long as they paid a quota in logs or shingles, and businesses may have ignored the fugitive nature of <b>escaped</b> slaves who provided work in exchange for trade goods.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Safe <b>escape</b> in {{the fire}} {{disaster}} of high-rise buildings is a world-wide unsolved problem because of the complicated structure {{of the building and}} the huge amounts of resident. Nowadays the chute devices for <b>escaping</b> in high-rise building become important for collective <b>escape,</b> which is easy to use and runs at high speed without extra power. Rigid <b>escape</b> chutes and flexible <b>escape</b> chutes are introduced in this paper. The assembly of <b>escape</b> chutes and their disadvantages are discussed. For more function and more effective, a flexible multi-entrance <b>escape</b> chute with its store box is designed. This device offers a fire-proof, high temperature-proof and multi-entrance passage for collective <b>escapes</b> at the same time. Experiments of its prototype shows that this equipment can release <b>escape</b> chute in time, and bring evacuee more safety and <b>escape</b> efficiency...|$|R

Every <b>escape</b> sequence specifies one character which is to be placed directly into the string. The actual number of characters required in an <b>escape</b> sequence varies.

40|$|Punishment and <b>escape</b> {{were studied}} {{simultaneously}} by allowing a subject to <b>escape</b> from a stimulus {{situation in which}} responses were punished, into a stimulus situation in which responses were not punished.

40|$|Intrahost simian {{immunodeficiency}} virus (SIV) evolution {{is marked by}} repeated viral <b>escape</b> from cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTLs) response. Typically, the first such CTL <b>escape</b> occurs {{in a matter of}} days, starting around the time of peak viral load. Many authors have developed methods to quantify the strength of CTL response by measuring the rate at which CTL <b>escape</b> occurs, but such methods usually depend on sampling at two or more timepoints, while many datasets capture the dynamics of the first CTL <b>escape</b> at only a single timepoint. Here, we develop inference meth-ods for CTL <b>escape</b> rates applicable to single timepoint datasets. Through a model of early infection dynamics, we construct confidence intervals for <b>escape</b> rates, but since early infection dynamics are not completely under-stood, we also develop a one-sided confidence interval serving as a lower bound for <b>escape</b> rates over a collection of early infection models. We apply our methods to two SIV datasets, using our lower bounds and ex-isting methods to show that <b>escape</b> rates are relatively high during the initial days of the first CTL <b>escape</b> and then drop to lower levels as the <b>escape</b> proceeds. We also compare <b>escape</b> in the lymph nodes and the rectal mucosa, showing that <b>escape</b> in the lymph nodes is initially faster, but as the first <b>escape</b> proceeds, the rate of <b>escape</b> in the lymph nodes drops below the rate seen in the rectal mucosa. ...|$|R
