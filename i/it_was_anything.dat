As a teenager, Cheryl came out as a lesbian {{to her mother and}} father, Steve Crane; reflecting on it, Cheryl recalled: [...] "I always felt I had the full support of my parents... I was never made to feel that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> strange." ...|$|E
500|$|Whiteread's agent Karsten Schubert said, [...] "The {{whole affair}} was a non-event. They {{achieved}} nothing {{and they were}} left looking like real prats." [...] Peter Chater, a director of Schubert's agency concurred; he called Drummond and Cauty [...] "cowards". [...] "It was obviously a publicity stunt. What sort of statement {{they were trying to}} make I don't know. If <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> to do with the relationship between art and money it was pretty crass. The KLF made a fortune from a couple of successful singles. Artists aren't in that position. Threatening to set light to £40,000 is pretty obscene." [...] Former Factory Records boss Tony Wilson applauded the group, however. [...] "The K Foundation is a very peculiar avant garde group whose ideas are as valid anything the Turner people do," [...] he told NME. [...] "Since when has there been laws governing what constitutes art, or an artistic statement? OK, {{so a lot of people}} don't understand what Bill and Jimmy are trying to say, but how many people know exactly what Rachel Whiteread's trying to say with her art?" ...|$|E

2500|$|While the {{financial}} model {{may have been}} broken for the Trail Blazers, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> but for Portland Arena Management. [...] Rose Quarter GM Mike Scanlon of Global Spectrum stated {{that the company was}} [...] "very happy with how things are going at the Rose Garden", and referred to Global's stewardship of the Garden as a [...] "very positive experience". [...] He noted that the arena did 45 concerts in 2005, and that same year landed another sports tenant, the Portland LumberJax of the National Lacrosse League.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, {{two members}} of the Harriton High School student council twice privately confronted their Principal, Steven Kline, more than a year prior to the suit. [...] They were {{concerned}} [...] "that the school could covertly photograph students using the laptops' cameras." [...] Students were particularly troubled by the momentary flickering of their webcams' green activation lights, which several students reported would periodically turn on when the camera wasn't in use, signaling that the webcam had been turned on. Student Katerina Perech recalled: [...] "It was just really creepy." [...] Some school officials reportedly denied that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> other than a technical glitch, and offered to have the laptops examined if students were concerned. [...] Kline admitted the school could covertly photograph students using the laptops' cameras. [...] The students told him they were worried about privacy rights, asked whether the school system read the saved files on their computers, and suggested that at minimum the student body should be warned formally of possible surveillance. [...] No such action was taken.|$|E
2500|$|Webb {{was found}} dead in his Carmichael home on December 10, 2004, with two gunshot wounds to the head. His death was ruled a suicide by the Sacramento County coroner's office. After a local paper {{reported}} that he had died from multiple gunshots, the coroner's office received so many calls asking about Webb's death that Sacramento County Coroner Robert Lyons issued a statement confirming Webb had committed suicide. When asked by local reporters about the possibility of two gunshots being a suicide, Lyons replied: [...] "It's unusual in a suicide case to have two shots, but it has been done in the past, and it is in fact a distinct possibility." [...] News coverage noted that there were widespread rumors on the Internet at the time that Webb had been killed as retribution for his 'Dark Alliance' series, published eight years before, but Webb's ex-wife Susan Bell told reporters that she believed Webb had committed suicide. [...] "The way he was acting {{it would be hard for}} me to believe <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> but suicide," [...] she said. According to Bell, Webb had been unhappy for some time over his inability to get a job at another major newspaper. He had sold his house the week before his death because he was unable to afford the mortgage.|$|E

2500|$|Like Archipenko and Csaky, both Lipchitz and Henri Laurens {{were aware}} of {{primitive}} African art, though hardly evident in their works. Lipchitz collected African art from 1912 on, but Laurens, in fact, {{appears to have been}} entirely unaffected by African art. Both his early reliefs and three-dimensional sculptures attach problems posed by Cubist painters first. Lipchitz and Laurens were concerned with giving tangible substance to idea first pronounced by Jean Metzinger in his 1910 Note sur la peinture of simultaneous multiple views. [...] "They were", as Goldwater notes, [...] "undoubtedly impressed with the natural three-dimensionality of African sculpture and with its rhythmic interplay of solid and related void. But in its frontality and mass, though often composed of cubic shapes, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> but cubist, and was indeed, fundamentally anti-cubist in conception". The African sculptor, writes Goldwater, [...] "whether his forms were rectangular, elliptical, or round in outline, and whether he cut back little or much into the cylinder of fresh wood with which he began, was content to show one aspect of his figure at a time". Goldwater continues: :"He achieved his [...] "instinctive" [...] three-dimensional effect by calculated simplification and separation of parts that allowed the eye to grasp each one as a unified, coherent mass. The cubist sculptor, on the other hand, wished to [...] "make his figure turn" [...] by simultaneously showing or suggesting frontal and orthogonal planes, by flattening diagonals, and by swinging other hidden surfaces into view." ...|$|E
