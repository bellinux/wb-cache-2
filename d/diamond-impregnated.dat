50|$|Wire saws {{are similar}} in {{principle}} to band saws or reciprocating saws, but they use abrasion to cut rather than saw teeth. Depending on the application, diamond material {{may or may not}} be used as an abrasive. The wire can have one strand or many strands braided together (cable). A single-strand saw can be roughened to be abrasive, abrasive compounds can be bonded to the cable, or <b>diamond-impregnated</b> beads (and spacers) can be threaded on the cable. Wire saws are often cooled and lubricated by water or oil.|$|E
50|$|Mining and {{quarrying}} industries commonly use a wire saw to cut hard stone {{into large}} blocks that {{can then be}} shipped to processing plants to be further refined (in the case of ore dressing) or shipped to distributors (in the case of granite or marble for building). These wire saws are large machines that use <b>diamond-impregnated</b> beads on a cable. The saws allow {{the bottom of a}} quarry slab to be cut free (after the cable is passed through access drill holes); with the bottom cut, back and side charges (explosives) can cleanly cleave the slab. Quarry saws on this principle date back centuries; before the era of steel cables with diamond cutters, there were fiber ropes that drew sand through the kerf. The sand (flushed with water) cut the stone (albeit more slowly than diamond does today).|$|E
50|$|Oil well {{drilling}} utilises tri-cone roller, carbide embedded, fixed-cutter diamond, or <b>diamond-impregnated</b> drill bits {{to wear away}} at the cutting face. This is preferred {{because there is no}} need to return intact samples to surface for assay as the objective is to reach a formation containing oil or natural gas. Sizable machinery is used, enabling depths of several kilometres to be penetrated. Rotating hollow drill pipes carry down bentonite and barite infused drilling muds to lubricate, cool, and clean the drilling bit, control downhole pressures, stabilize the wall of the borehole and remove drill cuttings. The mud travels back to the surface around the outside of the drill pipe, called the annulus. Examining rock chips extracted from the mud is known as mud logging. Another form of well logging is electronic and is commonly employed to evaluate the existence of possible oil and gas deposits in the borehole. This can take place while the well is being drilled, using Measurement While Drilling tools, or after drilling, by lowering measurement tools into the newly drilled hole.|$|E
5000|$|Diamond core {{drilling}} (exploration diamond drilling) utilizes an annular <b>diamond-impregnated</b> drill bit {{attached to the}} end of hollow drill rods to cut a cylindrical core of solid rock. The diamonds used to make diamond core bits are a variety of sizes, fine to microfine industrial grade diamonds, and the ratio of diamonds to metal used in the matrix affects the performance of the bits cutting ability in different types of rock formations [...] The diamonds are set within a matrix of varying hardness, from brass to high-grade steel. Matrix hardness, diamond size and dosing can be varied according to the rock which must be cut. The bits made with hard steel with a low diamond count are ideal for softer highly fractured rock while others made of softer steels and high diamond ratio are good for coring in hard solid rock. Holes within the bit allow water to be delivered to the cutting face. This provides three essential functions — lubrication, cooling, and removal of drill cuttings from the hole.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the mechanical {{properties of materials}} fabricated from commercially available powders designed {{for use as a}} metal matrix of <b>diamond-impregnated</b> composites. The powders with the catalogue numbers CSA and CSA 800 produced in China were tested under laboratory conditions. The specimens were fabricated in a graphite mould using hot pressing. The materials were analysed for density, porosity, hardness and static tensile strength. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was employed to observe the microstructure and fracture surfaces of the specimens. The experimental data was used to determine how the chemical composition of the powders and the process parameters affected the microstructure and properties of the materials. The properties of the sintered materials produced from the Chinese powders were compared with the properties reported for specimens fabricated from cobalt powder (Co SMS). Even though the hot pressed CSA and CSA 800 powders had inferior mechanical properties to their cobalt analogue, they seem well-suited for general-purpose <b>diamond-impregnated</b> tools with less demanding applications...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This is {{the second}} {{in a series of}} three papers {{concerned}} with the improvement of the performance of <b>diamond-impregnated</b> segments for the circular sawing of natural rock materials. In Part 1, the influences of segment components on the performance of segments were studied through relating segment working state with its sawing performance. This second part is devoted to study the mechanisms for the retention of coated diamond grits and the influence of diamond strength disparity. Scanning Electron Microscope and Energy Dispersive Spectrometers were employed to analyze the bonding of diamonds to an iron-based matrix at two situations where un-coated and Ti-Cr coated diamonds were used respectively. Strong metallurgical bonding was observed between the coated diamond and the metal matrix and subsequently the retention ability was increased. However, the retention effect of coating was greatly offset by the disparity of diamond strength...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to perform sinterability studies of ball-milled Fe- 12 %Ni- 6. 4 %Cu- 1. 6 %Sn- 0. 6 %C powders. A mixture of precisely weighed amounts of elemental iron, nickel and graphite, and pre-alloyed 80 / 20 bronze powders was ball-milled for 8, 30 and 120 hours. After cold-pressing at 400 MPa the specimens were sintered at 900 ◦C for 30 minutes in a reducing atmosphere and subsequently tested for density and hardness as well as subjected to structural studies using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The obtained results showed that only the powder ball-milled for 120 hours yielded a near pore-free material after consolidation by cold pressing and pressureless sintering at 900 ◦C. As such, it could have a potential to be used in production of <b>diamond-impregnated</b> wire saw beads...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines has {{continued}} its investigation of chemical additive drilling fluids that produce a zero surface charge (ZSC) {{on a rock}} to better define the boundary conditions of the phenomenon. Laboratory drilling tests were performed on Minnesota taconite, Tennessee marble, and Sioux Quartzite using <b>diamond-impregnated</b> coring bits or tungsten carbide spade bits. Drilling fluids were made from chemical additives such as inorganic salts, cationic surfactants, cationic polymers, acids, or nonionic polymers in either distilled, deionized water (DDIW), mine pond water, mine well water, or tap water. These additives were tested below, at, and above their respective ZSC concentrations. Penetration and bit life improvements obtained with ZSC concentration solutions ranged from 88 and 56 pct, respectively, to over 650 pct and over 400 pct, respectively, for the additives tested. Polyethylene oxide (PEO) {{was found to be}} the best additive for ZSC-controlled drilling because a continuous range of PEO solution concentrations produced the enhanced ZSC-controlled drilling performance...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} vibration measurements at rotary drilling of andesite, granite and limestone. The measurements were carried out on the drilling stand using <b>diamond-impregnated</b> bits of 46 mm diameter. The vibration signal was monitored by the Microlog CMVA 55 at constant input parameters (constant thrust or constant revolutions). The revolutions were changed from 3, 33 s- 1 to 23, 33 s- 1 stepwise by 3, 33 s- 1. Similarly, at constant revolutions 16, 66 s- 1 the thrust was set to 5500, 7500, 9500 and 11500 N. The results of vibration signal analysis in the frequency domain are presented further in the paper. The aim of the vibration measurement is to study the mechanism of rock disintegration. The Vibration frequency spectrum contains a significant amplitude, which denotes the frequency of revolutions of the drilling tool. The Frequency spectrum of measurements contains also higher harmonic and subharmonic frequencies. There are significant sidebands in the surround of higher harmonic frequencies. The {{results show that the}} vibration measurement may be used for the identification of regime parameters at the rock drilling...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Rotary {{ultrasonic}} machining (RUM) {{is considered to}} be a very effective and relatively accurate way to drill deep holes in brittle materials. Although brittle fracture (micro chipping) is the dominant material removal mechanism utilized by the RUM process, poor surface roughness and deep penetrated cracks are the consequence if the machining parameters are not properly controlled. To ensure the quality of the generated surface and to improve the process efficiency, efforts have been made in this study to correlate the material removal mechanisms, surface integrity and tool wear involved in the RUM process. <b>Diamond-impregnated</b> tools were used in the experiment and the ultrasonic vibration frequency was kept at 20 kHz. Three major material removal modes namely, impact mode, grinding mode and erosion mode were found to be the dominant removal processes at the tool tip, around the diamond wheel and around the steel sleeve respectively. It was also found that, during the grinding/erosion processes, the bonding material of the wheel was first eroded away and left big part of diamond grits well-exposed. Pull-out and/or fracture are normally the consequence of these exposed diamond grits due to the lack of support and protection...|$|E
40|$|Objective. This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} immediate or delayed finishing/polishing using different systems on the surface roughness, hardness, and microleakage of a silorane-based composite. Material and Methods. Specimens were made with silorane-based composite (Filtek P 90, 3 M ESPE) and assigned to the treatments: control (light-cured); aluminum oxide discs (Sof-Lex, 3 M ESPE); <b>diamond-impregnated</b> silicone tips (Astropol, Ivoclar Vivadent); aluminum oxide-impregnated silicone tips (Enhance, Dentsply). Half of the specimens were finished/polished immediately and the rest after 7 days. Surface roughness (Ra, μm; n= 20) and Vickers microhardness (50 [*]g; 45 [*]s; n= 10) were measured. Cavities were prepared in bovine incisors and filled with Filtek P 90. The fillings received immediate or delayed finishing/polishing (n= 10) and were subjected to dye penetration test (0. 5 % basic fuchsin, 24 [*]h). Data were analyzed by ANOVA and Scheffe, Kruskal-Wallis, and Mann-Whitney tests (p< 0. 05). Results. The finishing/polishing system significantly influenced roughness and microhardness (p< 0. 0001). For enamel, microleakage was not affected by the finishing/polishing system (p= 0. 309). For dentin, Sof-Lex discs and Astropol points promoted greater microleakage than Enhance points (p= 0. 033). Conclusion. Considering roughness, microhardness, and microleakage together, immediate finishing/polishing of a silorane-based composite using aluminum oxide discs may be recommended...|$|E
40|$|The {{fabrication}} of precision laser targets requires {{a wide variety}} of specialized mesoscale manufacturing techniques. The diamond wire saw developed in this study provides the capability to precisely section meso-scale workpieces mounted on the assembly stations used by the Target Fabrication Group. This new capability greatly simplifies the {{fabrication of}} many types of targets and reduces the time and cost required to build the targets. A variety of materials are used to fabricate targets, including metals, plastics with custom designed chemical formulas, and aerogels of various densities. The materials are usually provided in the form of small pieces or cast rods that must be machined to the required shape. Many of these materials, such as metals and some plastics, can be trimmed using a parting tool on a diamond turning machine. However, other materials, such as aerogels and brittle materials, cannot be adequately cut with a parting tool. In addition, the geometry of the parts often requires that the workpieces be held in a special assembly station, which excludes the use of a parting tool. In the past, these materials were sectioned using a small, handheld coping saw that used a <b>diamond-impregnated</b> wire as a blade. This miniature coping saw was effective, but it required several hours to cut through certain materials. Furthermore, the saw was guided by hand and often caused significant damage to fragile aerogels. To solve these problems, the diamond wire saw shown in Figure 1 was developed. The diamond wire saw is designed to machine through materials that are mounted in the Target Fabrication Group's benchtop assembly stations. These assembly stations are the primary means of aligning and assembling target components, and there is often a need to machine materials while they are mounted in the assembly stations. Unfortunately, commercially available saws are designed for very different applications and are far too large to be used with the assembly stations. Therefore, a custom diamond wire saw was designed and constructed. The diamond wire saw cuts through workpieces using a continuous loop of <b>diamond-impregnated</b> wire of length 840 mm. The wire loop runs around several idler pulleys and is driven by a simple geared DC motor that rotates at 17 rpm. The linear speed of the wire is 107 inches/minute. The saw is oriented at an angle of 20 {sup o} from horizontal, so the operator can view the wire through the cutout at {{the front end of the}} saw. When looking through a microscope or camera with a horizontal line of sight, the operator can clearly see the wire as it cuts through the workpiece, as shown in the right side of Figure 1. The saw is mounted on a two-axis stage that allows the operator to align the wire with the workpiece. To cut through the workpiece, the operator drives the wire through the workpiece by turning the feed micrometer. An image of the interior of the diamond wire saw appears in Figure 2. This picture was taken after removing the protective cover plate from the saw...|$|E
