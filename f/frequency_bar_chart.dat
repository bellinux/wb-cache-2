40|$|The study {{examined}} effects of manpower {{planning and development}} in Lagos state civil service performance. Lagos state civil service is the greatest asset {{of the state in}} its quest for socio-economic development. The primary question that was explored is whether the nature of manpower planning and development curriculum in Lagos state civil service has effect on the service performance and the attainment of state objective. The study relied on primary and secondary data, and multiple stage sampling technique was used to select the sample population. The data collected was presented in <b>frequency</b> <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> and simple percentage. Pearson’s Product Moment Correlation Coefficient (PPMC) statistical tool was used to test the hypotheses. Findings of the study show that the nature of manpower planning and development curriculum has a positive effect on the Lagos state civil performance. It also reveals that the manpower planning and development has a positive effect on the attainment of Lagos state objective. To achieve better performance in the service, it should among others, improve on the current manpower planning strategy and continue to update its manpower development curriculum in line with the global best practices. Given the pivotal role that technology plays in the 21 st century, the service should avail itself the windows of opportunities that information technology provides in its drive to enhance employees’ skills, knowledge and abilities that will invariably improve the service performance. Yet, the service should imbibe the prescripts of New PublicManagement theory (NPM), and that goals and targets should be defined and measurable as indicators of organizational performance...|$|E
