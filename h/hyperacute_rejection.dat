25|$|After a liver transplantation, {{there are}} three types of graft {{rejection}} that may occur. They include <b>hyperacute</b> <b>rejection,</b> acute rejection and chronic rejection. <b>Hyperacute</b> <b>rejection</b> is caused by preformed anti-donor antibodies.

Unlike <b>hyperacute</b> <b>rejection,</b> which is B cell mediated, acute rejection is mediated by T cells. It involves direct cytotoxicity and cytokine mediated pathways. Acute rejection is the most common and the primary target of immunosuppressive agents. Acute rejection is usually seen within days or weeks of the transplant.

The cause of chronic rejection is still unknown but an acute rejection is a strong predictor of chronic rejections.|$|E

40|$|Antibody {{mediated}} rejection (AMR) {{is becoming}} an increasing challenge in renal allotransplantation. AMR is usually associated with profound allograft dysfunc-tion and inferior allograft survival. In the era of refined crossmatch-techniques and improved solid-phase assays, <b>hyperacute</b> <b>rejections</b> in presensitized patients are less common. Majority of AMRs occur due to de novo production of donor specific antibodies. AMR appears to stand for a spectrum of histologic changes paralled with immunohistochemical positivity for C 4 d along peritubular capillaries. Removal of antibodies with plasmapheresis or immunoadsorption in combi-nation with neutralizing and immunomodulatory intravenous immunoglobulin are therapy standards in majority of transplant centers worldwide. The addition of anti-CD 20 (rituximab) with the aim {{to reduce the number}} of B-cells may offer advantage in some cases. Apart from donor specific HLA-antibodies, non-HLA antibodies reacting to arterial antigens have been speculated to be responsible for rejections in some patients. More precise definition of antigen targets for non-HLA antibodies is emerging. The analysis of the subtle mechanistic and diagnostic differences among rejection subtypes will help to identify patients at particular risk and improve outcome of AMR...|$|R

Fifty-six (29 %) had a positive B cell crossmatch (21 cold, 35 warm); 14 were autoantibody positive, 23 autoantibody negative, and 19 were not tested for autoantibody. There were no differences in HLA-A, B, C, or DR antigen disparity between the B cell positive (14, 0 DR mismatch; 25, 1 DR mismatch; 9, 0 DR mismatch) and the B cell negative group (40, 0 DR mismatch; 57, 1 DR mismatch; 13, 2 DR mismatch). Similarly, age, diabetic status, and number and type of pretransplant blood transfusions were comparable between B cell positive and negative groups. Although there were no <b>hyperacute</b> <b>rejections,</b> 2 -year actuarial graft survival was significantly lower in the B cell positive group, regardless of donor source, graft number, or temperature of reaction.

40|$|Including {{clinical}} and scientific {{contributions to the}} fields of tolerance induction, xenotransplantation, and intestinal and multivisceral transplantation, this manuscript presents scientific work from three innovative fields in transplant immunology and transplant medicine. The scientific work regarding the role of heterologous immunity in tolerance induction clearly showed that various obstacles, such as immunological memory, have to be overcome {{on the way to}} operational tolerance, i. e. long-term graft survival without chronic immunosuppression. As one special problem, the influence of heterologous immunity on a potentially clinical relevant tolerance induction model was investigated. The further development of clinical tolerance induction will essentially depend on the ability to surmount such obstacles without burdening patients with unreasonable risks. The second focus of this manuscript, xenotransplantation, {{plays a major role in}} the considerations on overcoming the lack of deceased donors since the early beginnings of organ transplantation. Although the development of transgenic donor animals represents a major step forward to avoid <b>hyperacute</b> xenogeneic <b>rejection,</b> no major advances in long-term xenograft survival have been achieved. Besides physiological incompatibilities, cellular xenoimmune responses, which may occur after <b>hyperacute</b> humoral <b>rejection,</b> do not respond to conventional immunosuppression sufficiently. Progress in tolerance induction against allografts my also be a key to the further development of clinical xenotransplantation. Along with the establishment of the intestinal transplant program at the Charité, the clinical practicability of this procedure was reproduced. With the first description of the application of TNF-? - inhibitors as immunosuppressants in organ transplantation, a major improvement in the therapy of refractory organ rejections and chronic allograft alterations after intestinal transplantation may be achieved, thus potentially lowering the high rates of organ failure due to severe rejections and chronic allograft failure...|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} delayed xenoactive {{rejection}}, {{this type of}} rejection occurs in discordant xenografts within 2 to 3 days, if <b>hyperacute</b> <b>rejection</b> is prevented. The process is much more complex than <b>hyperacute</b> <b>rejection</b> and is currently not completely understood. Acute vascular rejection requires de novo protein synthesis and is driven by interactions between the graft endothelial cells and host antibodies, macrophages, and platelets. The response is characterized by an inflammatory infiltrate of mostly macrophages and natural killer cells (with small numbers of T cells), intravascular thrombosis, and fibrinoid necrosis of vessel walls.|$|E

40|$|Most of the time, {{transplantation}} rejection is immunologi-cally mediated. Both T {{cells and}} circulating antibodies are induced against allografts and xeno-grafts. Antibodies pro-duced {{are responsible for}} <b>hyperacute</b> <b>rejections,</b> T cells are mainly responsible for rejection of most other tissues. The most important transplantation antigens, which cause rapid rejection of the allograft, are found on cell mem-branes and are encoded by genes in the major histocom-patibility complex (MHC) which is known as HLA in humans and H- 2 in mice. HLA helps in discriminating be-tween self and non-self. The approaches to enhance graft survival are gaining acceptance and wide use in human tissue and organ transplantation. Various mechanisms involved in allograft rejection are discussed in detail in this review. THE clinical application of {{our knowledge of the}} immune barriers to transplantation has advanced allo-organ re-placement therapy to the level of routine practice. The suc-cess of an organ transplant is the function of several variables. However, the major determinant of acceptance or rejection of a technically perfect graft is the magnitude of the immunologically mediated responses against graft. The delineation and application of recent discoveries in cell co-stimulatory events, antigen presentation and differential T lymphocytes are opening pathways towards the develop-ment of tolerogenic protocols for clinical transplantation. The genetic differences between recipient and donor elicit immune response that could be prevented by genetic com-patibility, which is determined on the basis of human leuko-cyte antigens (HLA). These antigens {{play an important role in}} immune discrimination between self and non-self (for-eign) and effectively promote detection and eradication of foreign molecules. Similarly, immune mechanisms are associated with the recognition of alloantigens in allogenic transplanta-tion.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Xenoreactive human natural {{antibodies}} (NAb) {{are predominantly}} directed against galactose-alpha(1, 3) galactose (Gal). Binding of immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM NAb activates porcine endothelial cells (pEC) and triggers complement lysis responsible for <b>hyperacute</b> xenograft <b>rejection.</b> In vitro, IgG NAb induce human natural killer (NK) cell-mediated lysis of pEC by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The present {{study examined the}} levels of anti-porcine NAb in {{a large number of}} individuals and addressed the functional role of non-Gal anti-porcine NAb. METHODS: Sera from 120 healthy human blood donors were analyzed for the presence of anti-porcine NAb by flow cytometry using porcine red blood cells (pRBC), lymphoblastoid cells (pLCL), and pEC derived from control or Gal-deficient pigs. Xenogeneic complement lysis was measured by flow cytometry using human serum and rabbit complement. ADCC was analyzed by chromium-release assays using human serum and freshly isolated NK cells. RESULTS: Human IgM binding to pRBC was found in 93 % and IgG binding in 86 % of all samples. Non-Gal NAb comprised 13 % of total IgM and 36 % of total IgG binding to pEC. NAb/complement-induced lysis and ADCC of Gal-deficient compared to Gal-positive pEC were 21 % and 29 %, respectively. The majority of anti-Gal and non-Gal IgG NAb were of the IgG 2 subclass. CONCLUSIONS: The generation of Gal-deficient pigs has overcome <b>hyperacute</b> anti-Gal-mediated xenograft <b>rejection</b> in nonhuman primates. Non-Gal anti-porcine NAb represent a potentially relevant immunological hurdle in a subgroup of individuals by inducing endothelial damage in xenografts...|$|R

40|$|Donor-specific {{antibodies}} (DSA) form {{a significant}} barrier in solid organ transplantation of highly pre-sensitized candidates. Although avoiding transplantation over a positive cross-match test can largely prevent {{the occurrence of}} <b>hyperacute</b> antibody-mediated <b>rejection,</b> transplantation of highly pre-sensitized candidates is often complicated by the occurrence of acute and chronic antibody-mediated graft rejection leading to diminished graft function and survival.

Furthermore, increasing evidence underlines the association of newly formed de novo DSA after transplantation with poor graft function and survival.

40|$|Acute or even <b>hyperacute</b> humoral graft <b>rejection,</b> {{mediated}} by classical pathway complement activation, occurs in allo- and xenotransplantation due to preformed anti-graft antibodies. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) preparations can prevent complement-mediated tissue injury and delay <b>hyperacute</b> xenograft <b>rejection.</b> It {{is known that}} IgM-enriched IVIg (IVIgM) has a higher capacity to block complement than IVIgG. Different IVIgs were therefore tested for specificity of complement inhibition and effect on anti-bacterial activity of human serum. IVIgM-I (Pentaglobin), 12 % IgM), IVIgM-II (IgM-fraction of IVIgM-I, 60 % IgM), and three different IVIgG (all > 95 % IgG) were used. The known complement inhibitor dextran sulfate was used as control. Hemolytic assays were performed to analyze pathway-specificity of complement inhibition. Effects of IVIg on complement deposition on pig cells and Escherichia coli were assessed by flow cytometry and cytotoxicity as well as bactericidal assays. Complement inhibition by IVIgM was specific for the classical pathway, with IC 50 values of 0. 8 mg/ml for IVIgM-II and 1. 7 mg/ml for IVIgM-I in the CH 50 assay. Only minimal inhibition of the lectin pathway was seen with IVIgM-II (IC 50 15. 5 mg/ml); no alternative pathway inhibition was observed. IVIgG did not inhibit complement in any hemolytic assay. Classical pathway complement inhibition by IVIgM was confirmed in an in vitro xenotransplantation model with PK 15 cells. In contrast, IVIgM did not inhibit (mainly alternative pathway mediated) killing of E. coli by human serum. In conclusion, IgM-enriched IVIg is a specific inhibitor of the classical complement pathway, leaving the alternative pathway intact, which is an important natural anti-bacterial defense, especially for immunosuppressed patients...|$|R

All sera contained variable amounts of HHA that killed the target cells via the classical complement pathway. The cytotoxic activity of these HHA was specifically inhibited by certain carbohydrates (a-D-melibiose, ß-Iactose, ß-gentiobiose, ß-cellobiose, D-mannose, N-acetyl-ß-D-mannosamine and a-D-rhamnose) and by rat IgM. By means of affinity chromatography with immobilized inhibitors we obtained an antibody preparation of mainly IgG type from NHS (up to 3. 5 mg/IO ml serum) that reacted strongly with rat lymphocytes and isolated rat pancreatic islets. Though thus far residual xenospecific antibody activity has remained in the sera even after multiple affinity chromatography, these data suggest that specific elimination of HHA is feasible and that it may be thus possible to overcome a major obstacle to xenotransplantation...|$|R

At 2 mg/kg, BM- 573 completely blocked pulmonary hypertensive effects of U- 46619 but pulmonary vascular compliance still decreased.

50|$|While kidneys can {{routinely}} {{be obtained}} from human donors, most organs {{are in short supply}} leading to consideration of xenotransplants from other species.

Unlike virtually all other mammals, humans and other primates do not make αGal, and in fact recognize it as an antigen.

Unmodified allografts were characterized by widespread intramural carbon labeling of the microvasculature, which corresponded to sites of platelet sequestration and extensive endothelial cell disintegration. Under conditions of recipient platelet depletion without concomitant complement depression, carbon-labeled segments of the microcirculation showed widespread endothelial cell disintegration, the ultrastructural features of which {{were similar to those}} observed in the unmodified allograft group. The microvasculature of syngeneic heart grafts transplanted to platelet-depleted recipients as well as all platelet-depleted recipients' own hearts showed no similar ultrastructural changes. It is thus concluded that the loss of cellular integrity of the microcirculatory endothelium in hyperacute rat cardiac allograft rejection is not a platelet-dependent phenomenon. The current ultrastructural data combined with previous morphologic studies provide strong evidence that the severe form of endothelial injury observed in this model is mediated by the direct action of activated complement components...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The {{generation}} of pigs lacking Galalpha 1, 3 Gal (alphaGal) or overexpressing human regulators of complement has largely overcome the barrier of <b>hyperacute</b> xenograft <b>rejection.</b> Nevertheless, {{delayed xenograft rejection}} remains a major hurdle, including humoral responses against nonalphaGal epitopes, and cellular innate immune responses. This review addresses the early interactions between the porcine endothelium and human natural killer cells, neutrophils, and monocytes/macrophages. RECENT FINDINGS: Whether human leukocyte recruitment to, and lysis of, porcine endothelial cells includes direct recognition of alphaGal remains a matter of debate. Although the human natural killer receptor natural killerRP 1 A may directly recognize alphaGal, several studies did not reveal significant differences regarding adhesion, transmigration, and cytotoxicity using porcine endothelial cells expressing or lacking alphaGal. The strong human monocyte response against pig cells partly relies on the inability of porcine ligands to ligate inhibitory human receptors, such as SIRPalpha. Strategies to overcome cellular innate immune responses include transgenic expression in porcine cells of human ligands for inhibitory receptors, together with species-specific blocking of porcine ligands mediating human leukocyte interactions. SUMMARY: Cellular human innate immune responses are increasingly recognized as barriers to successful pig-to-human xenotransplantation, and only a detailed knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved {{will allow us to}} overcome this barrier...|$|R
