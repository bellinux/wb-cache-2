50|$|CAL FIRE’s Mobile Communications Centers (MCC) are a rapid {{response}} mobile emergency incident communications system. Six CAL FIRE MCC are located throughout the state. The MCC provides {{a variety of}} <b>incident</b> <b>communication</b> support functions. Dispatchers monitor incident radio traffic and communicate with personnel on the incident as well as communicating and coordinating with the Emergency Command Center of the local administrative unit. Inside the MCC {{there is a general}} work area with computer workstations, amateur radio (HAM) operator stations, and audiovisual equipment. The MCC is the hub for communications activity at an emergency incident. It has satellite phone capabilities for those incidents where phone coverage is not available due to remoteness or catastrophic loss of phone service. It provides access to televised weather conditions and local news reports. It also serves as the cache for additional portable radios that are often needed at a large or complex incident.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{events have}} shown that in the {{aftermath}} of an unexpected <b>incident,</b> <b>communication</b> infrastructures {{play an important role in}} supporting critical services. Airborne communication networks have been recently studied for the provision of wireless communication services and it is a promising candidate for rapidly deployable and resilient emergency networks. However, the choice of communication technologies from Aerial platforms is a challenging issue and depends on a variety of factors including platform payload capacity, coverage and capacity requirements, to name a few. In this paper, we investigate the performance of 4 G LTE-WiFi multimode base stations deployed on airborne platforms which provides coverage for ﬁrst responders during emergencies. We present an adapted simulation model for the analysis of hybrid aerial-terrestrial systems and study the impact of platform elevation and mobility on the cell coverage and channel capacity. Performance analysis with a platform deployment of a single Aerial Base Station (eNodeB) corroborates that airborne units with 4 G communication capabilities are very promising candidates for robust communication links during emergency relief operations...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{two related}} data gathering problems for {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs). The MLDA problem is concerned with maximizing the system lifetime T {{so that we can}} perform T rounds of data gathering with in–network aggregation, given the initial available energy of the sensors. The M 2 EDA problem is concerned with minimizing the maximum energy consumed by any one sensor when performing T rounds of data gathering with in–network aggregation, for a given T. We provide an effective algorithm for finding an everywhere sparse integral solution to the M 2 EDA problem which is within a factor of α = 1 + 4 n/T of the optimum, where n is the number of nodes. A solution is everywhere sparse if the number of communication links for any subset X of nodes is O(X), in our case at most 4 |X|. Since often T = ω(n), we obtain the first everywhere sparse, asymptotically optimal integral solutions to the M 2 EDA problem. Everywhere sparse solutions are desirable since then almost all sensors have small number of <b>incident</b> <b>communication</b> links and small overhead for maintaining state. We also show that the MLDA and M 2 EDA problems are essentially equivalent, {{in the sense that we}} can obtain an optimal fractional solution to an instance of the MLDA problem by scalin...|$|E

METHODSA survey was adapted from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Nursing Home Survey on Patient Safety Culture (PSC-pLTC) and administered to a convenience sample of providers who work in pLTC during an educational workshop in November 2015. RESULTSForty-nine respondents from 32 facilities across all 4 U. S. census regions completed the survey. The adapted survey demonstrated excellent face validity, usability, feasibility and internal consistency reliability (Cronbach alpha = 0. 94). Highest ratings were given to overall perceptions of safety, feedback and <b>incident</b> <b>communication,</b> supervisors 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 expectations and actions and management support. Lower ratings were given to dimensions of teamwork, communication, handoffs and transitions, with the lowest ratings given to staffing and organizational learning.

30|$|Collision {{avoidance}} and on-board {{security are}} the most significant M 2 M services in ITS. The main purpose of using mobile M 2 M communication is to deal with line-of-sight (LoS) limitations {{in order to avoid}} accidents [125]. In case of an emergency, the collected information is sent to other vehicles or infrastructure within the communication range. To avoid further <b>incidents,</b> <b>communication</b> between the server and the vehicles must be very fast to detect emergency messages and deliver warning messages immediately. Since the response time to emergency/warning messages is significantly small (i.e., in milliseconds), collision avoidance services demand high QoS and low latency. Furthermore, these warning messages are small in size, thus should only be sent in critical situations to ensure efficient utilization of scarce radio resources in mobile networks [126].|$|R

40|$|Background: There {{has been}} recent {{rapid growth in}} the use of medical imaging leading to {{concerns}} about an increase in unnecessary investigations, patient exposure to radiation, and incorrect diagnoses. Incident reporting systems provide a portal for staff to catalogue adverse events which occur within a hospital or department. Analysing incident reports can reveal trends and provide guidance for quality improvement efforts. Methods: Classification of medical imaging related-incidents from a major teaching hospital in Sydney, Australia using WHO International Classification for Patient Safety (ICPS) taxonomy. All incidents with radiology identified as incident location (n= 219) were extracted. Incidents were from January 2005 to October 2011. Two researchers independently cleaned the data set. One researcher then applied the ICPS to free text incident reports. Results: 216 unique incidents were extracted. 15 incidents were unable to be classified using the ICPS. 8 incidents were classified twice, resulting in 209 coded <b>incidents.</b> <b>Communication</b> breakdown was a contributing factor in 49 % (103 / 209) of incidents reported. 147 of the 209 incidents were associated with activities associated with data collection, storage or retrieval of electronic information. Health information technology (HIT) systems were mentioned explicitly in 10 % of incidents, indicating some contribution to the error. Conclusions: Communication breakdown and HIT systems are contributors to error, and should be addressed. HIT systems need to be monitored and flaws addressed to ensure quality care. 6 page(s...|$|R
30|$|Mobile M 2 M {{communication}} offers manifold {{applications and}} services in modern transport and logistical processes such as onboard security, traffic and infrastructure management, fleet management, and route planning [19]. In case of an emergency, the collected data are sent to other vehicles as well as infrastructure to gain immediate attention. To avoid further <b>incidents,</b> <b>communication</b> between the infrastructure and the vehicles must be very fast to detect emergency messages and deliver warning messages immediately. Similarly, traffic and infrastructure management play {{a prominent role in}} handling the problem of road congestion. It tackles the problem by providing two-way communication opportunities between vehicles and infrastructure. Vehicles can send status updates about the position, speed, fuel consumption, and delivery status reports to the infrastructure and can also receive relevant instructions about road accidents and emergency braking system [20]. Moreover, M 2 M communications support several operations such as tracking of a stolen vehicle, traffic reports, and route planning as well as infotainment services [6]. For instance, to recover a stolen vehicle, SVT (Stolen Vehicle Tracking) service providers request data about the location from Telematic Control Unit (TCU) located inside the vehicle. In addition, drivers are also updated by sending reports regarding traffic in a particular region so that they can change or plan new routes in case of traffic jam or an emergency. Furthermore, infotainment services aim to provide news/information to drivers and passengers through mobile TV, web-browsing, etc.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{aimed to}} perform a {{structural}} analysis of determinants of risk of critical incidents in care for women with a low risk profile {{at the start of}} pregnancy with a view on improving patient safety. METHODS: We included 71 critical incidents in primary midwifery care and subsequent hospital care in case of referral after 36 weeks of pregnancy that were related to substandard care and for that reason were reported to the Health Care Inspectorate in The Netherlands in 36 months (n = 357). We performed a case-by-case analysis, using a previously validated instrument which covered five broad domains: healthcare organization, communication between healthcare providers, patient risk factors, clinical management, and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Determinants that were associated with risk concerned healthcare organization (n = 20 <b>incidents),</b> <b>communication</b> about treatment procedures (n = 39), referral processes (n = 19), risk assessment by telephone triage (n = 10), and clinical management in an out of hours setting (n = 19). The 71 critical incidents included three cases of maternal death, eight cases of severe maternal morbidity, 42 perinatal deaths and 12 critical incidents with severe morbidity for the child. Suboptimal prenatal risk assessment, a delay in availability of health care providers in urgent situations, miscommunication about treatment between care providers, and miscommunication with patients in situations with a language barrier were associated with safety risks. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic analysis of critical incidents improves insight in determinants of safety risk. The wide variety of determinants of risk of critical incidents implies that there is no single intervention to improve patient safety in the care for pregnant women with initially a low risk profile...|$|R

In {{response to such}} incidents it is therefore crucial to communicate radiation health risks {{in the context of}} other more common environmental and lifestyle risk factors. This study compares the risk of mortality from past radiation exposures (to people who survived the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombs and those exposed after the Chernobyl accident) with risks arising from air pollution, obesity and passive and active smoking. Methods A comparative assessment of mortality risks from ionising radiation was carried out by estimating radiation risks for realistic exposure scenarios and assessing those risks in comparison with risks from air pollution, obesity and passive and active smoking. Results The mortality risk to populations exposed to radiation from the Chernobyl accident may be no higher than that for other more common risk factors such as air pollution or passive smoking. Radiation exposures experienced by the most exposed group of survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki led to an average loss of life expectancy significantly lower than that caused by severe obesity or active smoking. Conclusion Population-averaged risks from exposures following major radiation incidents are clearly significant, but may be no greater than those from other much more common environmental and lifestyle factors.

40|$|Radiotherapy, {{with close}} to a million courses {{delivered}} per year in North America, is a very safe and effective intervention for a devastating disease. However, although rare, several deeply regrettable incidents have occurred in radiotherapy and have rightly {{been the subject of}} considerable public interest. Partly in response to reports of these incidents a variety of authoritative organizations across the globe has harnessed the expertise amongst their members in attempts to identify the measures that will make radiotherapy safer. While the intentions of all these organizations are clearly good it is challenging for the health care providers in the clinic to know where to start with so much advice coming from so many directions. Through a mapping exercise we have identified commonalities between recommendations made in seven authoritative documents and identified those issues most frequently cited. The documents reviewed contain a total of 117 recommendations. Using the 37 recommendations in Towards Safer Radiotherapy as the initial base layer, recommendations in the other documents were mapped, adding to the base layer to accommodate all the recommendations from the additional six documents as necessary. This mapping exercise resulted in the distillation of the original 117 recommendations down to 61 unique recommendations. Twelve topics were identified in three or more of the documents as being pertinent to the improvement of patient safety in radiotherapy. They are, in order of most to least cited: training, staffing, documentation, <b>incident</b> learning, <b>communication,</b> check lists, quality control and preventive maintenance, dosimetric audit, accreditation, minimizing interruptions, prospective risk assessment and safety culture. This analysis provides guidance for the selection of those activities most likely to enhance safety and quality in radiotherapy based on the frequency of citation in selected recent authoritative literature...|$|R
40|$|A {{modified}} critical-incident analysis {{technique was}} used in a retrospective examination {{of the characteristics of}} human error and equipment failure in anesthetic practice. The objective was to uncover patterns of frequently occurring incidents that are in need of careful prospective investigation. Forty seven interviews were conducted with staff and resident anesthesiologists at one urban teaching institution, and descriptions of 359 preventable incidents were obtained. Twenty three categories of details from these descriptions were subjected to computer-aided analysis for trends and patterns. Most of the preventable incidents involved human error (82 %), with breathing-circuit disconnections, inadvertent changes in gas flow, and drug syringe errors being frequent problems. Overt equipment failures constituted only 14 % {{of the total number of}} preventable incidents, but equipment design was indictable in many categories of human error, as were inadequate experience and insufficient familiarity with equipment or with the specific surgical procedure. Other factors frequently associated with <b>incidents</b> were inadequate <b>communication</b> among personnel, haste or lack of precaution, and distraction. Results from multi-hospital studies based on the methodology developed could be used for more objective determination of priorities and planning of specific investments for decreasing the risk associated with anesthesia...|$|R
