40|$|Statistical {{analyses}} commonly {{make use}} of models that suffer from loss of identifiability. In this paper, we address important {{issues related to the}} parameter estimation and hypothesis testing in models with loss of identifiability. That is, there are multiple parameter points corresponding to the same true model. We refer the set of these parameter points to as the set of true parameter values. We consider the case where the set of true parameter values is allowed to be very large or even infinite, some parameter values may lie on the boundary of the parameter space, and the data are not necessarily independently and identically distributed. Our results are applicable to a large class of estimators and their related testing statistics derived from optimizing an objective function such as a likelihood. We examine three specific examples: (i) a finite mixture logistic regression model; (ii) stationary ARMA processes; (iii) general quadratic approximation using Hellinger distance. The applications to these examples demonstrate the applicability of our results in a broad range of difficult statistical problems.

40|$|Double cones {{of birds}} are photoreceptors {{associated}} with motion perception, and perceiving motion is highly important to detect predators. Predation risks varies between habitats and may impose selective pressures {{that could affect}} organisms’ traits. There is evidence that birds show interspecific variations in visual system properties, such as the photoreceptor densities (single and double <b>cones)</b> and <b>distribution</b> across the retina. However, {{little is known about}} the relationship between the <b>distribution</b> of double <b>cones</b> and predator scanning strategies in birds living in different habitats. The goal of this study was to compare double <b>cones</b> <b>distributions</b> of birds that live in open vs. closed habitats. We measured the density and <b>distribution</b> of double <b>cones</b> in 2 species of the order Passeriformes. We found that the density of double cones in both species (open and closed habitat) is greater in the retina dorsal region. This result suggests that other visual traits might be taken into account in future work to better elucidate the relationship between habitat type and sensing motion. Moreover, the White-throated Sparrow had a more homogeneous <b>distribution</b> of double <b>cones,</b> result expected for this closed habitat species. Future work is suggested to be done using more individuals and more species to assess fully understand the evolution of predator- prey interactions and learn how prey can optimize vigilance strategies in different habitats with different predation pressure...|$|R

25|$|Due to the <b>distribution</b> of <b>cones</b> in the eye, the {{tristimulus values}} {{depend on the}} observer's field of view. To {{eliminate}} this variable, the CIE defined a color-mapping function called the standard (colorimetric) observer, to represent an average human's chromatic response within a 2° arc inside the fovea.

Thus the CIE 1931 Standard Observer function is also known as the CIE 1931 2° Standard Observer.

40|$|We {{purpose here}} {{to analyze and}} compare the {{population}} and topography of cone photoreceptors in two mouse strains using automated routines, and to design a method of retinal sampling for their accurate manual quantification. In whole-mounted retinas from pigmented C 57 /BL 6 and albino Swiss mice, the longwave-sensitive (L) and the shortwave-sensitive (S) opsins were immunodetected to analyze the population of each cone type. In another group of retinas both opsins were detected with the same fluorophore to quantify all cones. In a third set of retinas, L-opsin and Brn 3 a were immunodetected to determine whether L-opsin+cones and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) have a parallel <b>distribution.</b> <b>Cones</b> and RGCs were automatically quantified and their topography illustrated with isodensity maps. Our results show that pigmented mice have a significantly higher number of total cones (all-cones) and of L-opsin+cones than albinos which, in turn, have a higher population of S-opsin+cones. In pigmented animals 40 % of cones are dual (cones that express both opsins), 34 % genuine-L (cones that only express the L-opsin), and 26 % genuine-S (cones that only express the S-opsin). In albinos, 23 % of cones are genuine-S {{and the proportion of}} dual cones increases to 76 % at the expense of genuine-L cones. In both strains, L-opsin+cones are denser in the central than peripheral retina, and all-cones density increases dorso-ventrally. In pigmented animals S-opsin+cones are scarce in the dorsal retina and very numerous in the ventral retina, being densest in its nasal aspect. In albinos, S-opsin+cones are abundant in the dorsal retina, although their highest densities are also ventral. Based on the densities of each cone population, we propose a sampling method to manually quantify and infer their total population.

The {{focus of this}} investigation is to summarize the worldwide distribution of Conus and their species diversity with special reference to the Indian coast. In addition, this study will contribute to understanding the structural properties of conotoxin and therapeutic application of Conus venom peptides. Cone snails can inject a mix of various conotoxins and these venoms are their major weapon for prey capture, and may also have other biological purposes, {{and some of these}} conotoxins fatal to humans. Conus venoms contain a remarkable diversity of pharmacologically active small peptides; their targets are an iron channel and receptors in the neuromuscular system. Interspecific divergence is pronounced in venom peptide genes, which is generally attributed to their species specific biotic interactions. There is a notable interspecific divergence observed in venom peptide genes, which can be justified as of biotic interactions that stipulate species peculiar habitat and ecology of cone snails.

40|$|The {{narrow-band}} {{structure of}} terrestrial myriametric radiation (TMR) is investigated by ray tracing electrostatic waves {{in a hot}} plasma which contains a loss <b>cone</b> <b>distribution.</b> Path-integrated growth of electrostatic waves which refract to the radio window, where mode conversion into TMR is assumed to take place, show that wave amplitudes at the window are approximately 20 – 30 µV m− 1. This is more than sufficient {{to account for the}} observed TMR amplitudes of 2 – 10 µV m− 1. During propagation, if the wave frequency becomes close to nfce on the forward electrostatic branch then the waves are heavily damped and no energy is transferred to the radio window. It is shown that the narrow-band frequency bandwidth is less than the source electron gyrofrequency fce, but the separation between spectral peaks across several bands is equal to or slightly greater than fce. Increasing the density gradient reduces the wave amplitudes by reducing the resonant parallel wave number so that waves no longer resonate with the most unstable part of the loss <b>cone</b> <b>distribution.</b> Therefore there is an upper limit to the density gradient for efficient generation of TMR...|$|R
