40|$|Lichen planus is {{a chronic}} papulosquamous dermatoses {{in which both}} skin and mucosae are involved. There are various {{morphological}} forms of lichen planus. <b>Hypertrophic</b> <b>lichen</b> planus {{is one of the}} rare clinical variants. Herein, we report a very unusual presentation of <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>lichen</b> planus. A similar presentation has not been reported in literature yet, {{to the best of our}} knowledge...|$|E
40|$|Lichen planus is an {{inflammatory}} {{process that can}} affect the skin, mucosa, and hair follicles. An increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma has been noted in lichen planus of the mucosa. Rarely, in chronic, <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>lichen</b> planus of the skin, squamous cell neoplasms have been reported. We report a case of new onset lichen planopilaris with multiple squamous cell neoplasms...|$|E
40|$|<b>Hypertrophic</b> <b>lichen</b> planus (HLP) is a {{subacute}} chronic {{variant of}} lichen planus characterized by hypertrophic or warty lesions most often {{found on the}} pretibial area of the lower limbs. The treatment of the disease has been unsatisfactory so far. Several methods, including topical, systemic, and intralesional corticosteroids, have been used with varying success in this refractory disease. We report the excellent therapeutic effect of topical calcipotriol in a patient suffering LPH...|$|E
40|$|A {{long-term}} {{review of}} 108 women suffering from {{various forms of}} vulval dermatosis is described and {{a detailed analysis of}} those with chronic <b>hypertrophic</b> vulvitis, <b>lichen</b> sclerosus et atrophicus, and neurodermatitis is made. One case of neurodermatitis and two cases of lichen sclerosus progressed to carcinoma but no case of chronic hypertrophic vulvitis became malignant. It is possible that vulval dermatoses occur more commonly in the nulliparous than in the parous women and there is a slight preponderance of women who are blood group A. It is suggested that the term "leukoplakia" should be abandoned and that vulval lesions should be described in precise and meaningful histological terms...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} case of a 49 -year-old male with {{clinical}} and histological findings consistent with hypertrophic lupus erythematosus (HLE). HLE must be clinically and histologically differentiated from keratoacanthoma, <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>lichen</b> planus, squamous cell carcinoma and plaque type psoriasis. CD 123 positivity and transepidermal elimination of elastin have recently been reported as tools to distinguish HLE. Interestingly, in this case, biopsies of two separate lesions failed to reveal these two features. The etiology of this discrepancy is unknown and further studies are needed to clarify the utility of CD 123 positivity and transepidermal elimination of elastin in the diagnosis of hypertrophic lupus erythematosus...|$|E
40|$|Lichenoid drug {{eruption}} (LDE) following furosemide intake {{has been}} reported once in the literature (1). Several cases of bullous eruption (2) and generalized exanthematic pustulosis (3) caused by this drug have also been describ ed. We report here {{the case of a}} patient who developed a <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>lichen</b> planus-like eruption two months after starting furosemide for chronic renal failure. CASE REPORT A 65 -year-old man presented with a 2 -month history of cutaneous and pruriginous lesions on his trunk and limbs. His medical history included bilateral uretero-hydronephrosis with chronic renal failure, hyperuri-caemia, and bladder carcinoma. He had been receiving allopurinol and calcium for 2 years and had commence...|$|E
40|$|Graham Little-Lassueur Syndrome (GLLS) is {{considered}} a form of lichen planopilaris which associates follicular lichen planus, cicatricial alopecia of the scalp and noncicatricial alopecia of the axillary and/or pubic regions. We present {{the case of a}} 47 years old female patient, known for 5 years with chronic hepatitis C and a poor therapeutic control of the disease due to Interferon intolerance. She presented to our clinic for the occurrence on the shins of some well-defined, intensely pruritic erythematous plaques, covered with thick scales, with a verrucous appearance, accompanied by excoriations. The skin biopsy reveal <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>lichen</b> planus on the shins and lichen planopilaris on the scalp. The patient was treated with systemic antihystamines, topical corticosteroids and salicylic acid under occlusion, emollients, phototherapy UVB narrow band 4 sessions/week for 3 weeks, cryotherapy. From our knowledge this is the first case of GLLS associated with chronic viral hepatis C...|$|E
40|$|With {{the advent}} of the war in the South Pacific, {{medication}} for the prevention and cure of malaria was given to large numbers of men. During the past two years, atabrine (Quinacrine Hydrochloride) has been the drug most commonly used. Sulzberger reviewed the literature concerning a peculiar lichenoid eruption which occurred in individuals in the armed forces who were receiving atabrine. The eruption began from a few days to several months after the patients began taking the medication. It was common for the eruption to begin with eczematoid changes on the extremities, face and neck, and in some cases it began as a gen-eralized exfoliative erythroderma. Usually after the type of onset, lichen planus-like lesions appeared. These varied from typical, angular, violaceous papules to large <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>lichen</b> planus-like plaques, which later often showed atrophy, pigmentation or depigmentation. Some cases had leukoplakia-like lesions on the buccal mucosa and others had scalp lesions which at times caused permanent alopecia. At the Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, atabrine was administered to a group of these patients with quiescent lesions, causing a hig...|$|E
40|$|Lichen planus is {{a benign}} {{disorder}} {{characterized by an}} itchy, noninfectious skin rash. Though lichen planus is a common papulosquamous disorder affecting about 1 - 2 % of the population, neoplastic transformation of cutaneous lichen planus lesions occurs very rarely and should be borne in mind while treating nonhealing longstanding lesions of lichen planus. Studies suggest an estimated 0. 3 â€“ 3 % risk of malignancy in patients with oral lichen planus, however, cutaneous lichen planus does not carry {{an increased risk of}} malignant degeneration. We present a case of a 36 -year-old male with a 10 -year-long history of <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>lichen</b> planus who presented with a nonhealing ulcer in the left popliteal fossa. The patient underwent wide local excision with superficial skin grafting. Postoperative histopathological examination revealed verrucous squamous cell carcinoma complicating lichen planus. In view of underlying structure involvement, adjuvant radiation therapy was given. This case is being reported to emphasize the infrequent possibility of development of malignancy in cutaneous lichen planus, especially if it presents as a longstanding, nonhealing, itchy lesion with patchy areas of depigmentation in the lower limbs...|$|E
40|$|Beside to {{traditional}} use, dermoscopy {{is more and}} more used in the assessment of other "general" dermatologic conditions, namely scalp and hair disorders (trichoscopy), nails abnormalities (onychoscopy), skin infections and infestations (entomodermoscopy), and cutaneous inflammatory diseases (inflammoscopy). Among the list of new applications of dermoscopy, the study of inflammatory dermatoses is probably the most promising topic in terms of development and usefulness, considering the large number of such disorders and the frequent problems in their differential diagnosis which the dermatologist encounters in own daily clinical practice. In this paper, we report selected relatively common clinical differential diagnosis issues concerning inflammatory dermatoses (and some clinically related noninflammatory conditions), analysing them by a dermoscopic point of view in order to assist their noninvasive resolution according to the available literature data and our personal experience, including papulosquamous dermatoses (guttate psoriasis, pityriasis lichenoides chronica, pityriasis rosea, lichen planus, lymphomatoid papulosis, classic pityriasis rubra pilaris, papulosquamous sarcoidosis, disseminated forms of porokeratosis and papulosquamous chronic GVHD), dermatoses presenting with erythematous-desquamative patches/plaques (plaque psoriasis, eczematous dermatitis, pityriasis rosea, mycosis fungoides, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus), palmar psoriasis vs. chronic hand eczema, scalp psoriasis vs. seborrheic dermatitis, erythematous-desquamative disorders typically involving the elbows (psoriasis vulgaris, circumscribed juvenile pityriasis rubra pilaris, dermatomyositis/Gottron's sign), itchy papulonodular dermatoses (<b>hypertrophic</b> <b>lichen</b> planus, prurigo nodularis, nodular scabies and acquired perforating dermatosis), common facial inflammatory skin diseases (rosacea, seborrheic dermatitis and demodicidosis), lichen sclerosus vs. morphea, urticaria vs. urticarial vasculitis and common inflammatory cicatricial alopecia (discoid lupus erythematosus, lichen planopilaris and folliculitis decalvans) ...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, dermoscopy {{has been shown to}} be a useful tool in {{assisting}} the noninvasive diagnosis of various general dermatological disorders. In this article, we sought to provide an up-to-date practical overview on the use of dermoscopy in general dermatology by analysing the dermoscopic differential diagnosis of relatively common dermatological disorders grouped according to their clinical presentation, i. e. dermatoses presenting with erythematous-desquamative patches/plaques (plaque psoriasis, eczematous dermatitis, pityriasis rosea, mycosis fungoides and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus), papulosquamous/papulokeratotic dermatoses (lichen planus, pityriasis rosea, papulosquamous sarcoidosis, guttate psoriasis, pityriasis lichenoides chronica, classical pityriasis rubra pilaris, porokeratosis, lymphomatoid papulosis, papulosquamous chronic GVHD, parakeratosis variegata, Grover disease, Darier disease and BRAF-inhibitor-induced acantholytic dyskeratosis), facial inflammatory skin diseases (rosacea, seborrheic dermatitis, discoid lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, cutaneous leishmaniasis, lupus vulgaris, granuloma faciale and demodicidosis), acquired keratodermas (chronic hand eczema, palmar psoriasis, keratoderma due to mycosis fungoides, keratoderma resulting from pityriasis rubra pilaris, tinea manuum, palmar lichen planus and aquagenic palmar keratoderma), sclero-atrophic dermatoses (necrobiosis lipoidica, morphea and cutaneous lichen sclerosus), hypopigmented macular diseases (extragenital guttate lichen sclerosus, achromic pityriasis versicolor, guttate vitiligo, idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis, progressive macular hypomelanosis and postinflammatory hypopigmentations), hyperpigmented maculopapular diseases (pityriasis versicolor, lichen planus pigmentosus, Gougerot-Carteaud syndrome, Dowling-Degos disease, erythema ab igne, macular amyloidosis, lichen amyloidosus, friction melanosis, terra firma-forme dermatosis, urticaria pigmentosa and telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans), itchy papulonodular dermatoses (<b>hypertrophic</b> <b>lichen</b> planus, prurigo nodularis, nodular scabies and acquired perforating dermatosis), erythrodermas (due to psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, mycosis fungoides, pityriasis rubra pilaris and scabies), noninfectious balanitis (Zoon's plasma cell balanitis, psoriatic balanitis, seborrheic dermatitis and non-specific balanitis) and erythroplasia of Queyrat, inflammatory cicatricial alopecias (scalp discoid lupus erythematosus, lichen planopilaris, frontal fibrosing alopecia and folliculitis decalvans), nonscarring alopecias (alopecia areata, trichotillomania, androgenetic alopecia and telogen effluvium) and scaling disorders of the scalp (tinea capitis, scalp psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis and pityriasis amiantacea) ...|$|E
