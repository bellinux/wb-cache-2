5000|$|It {{is argued}} by several anthropologists, archaeologists and historians {{that we should}} not {{automatically}} assume that the producer of a surplus [...] "does not need" [...] (has no use for) what he exchanges or hands over as a tribute to a lord, employer or state functionary. Goods may be extracted from the <b>direct</b> <b>producers</b> which are not at all [...] "surplus" [...] to their own requirements, but which are appropriated by the rulers [...] "at the expense" [...] of the lifestyle of the <b>direct</b> <b>producers</b> in a [...] "zero-sum game". It all depends on the intensity of exploitation. So, for example, a law might stipulate that peasants must pay a fixed quantity of their products as a tax, regardless of whether the harvest has been good or bad. If the harvest was bad, the peasants might be left with insufficient products for their own needs.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the real}} world, Marxian economists like Samir Amin argue, unequal {{exchange}} occurs all the time, implying transfers of value {{from one place}} to another, through the trading process. Thus, the more trade becomes [...] "globalised", the greater the intermediation between producers and consumers; consequently, the intermediaries appropriate a growing fraction of the final value of the products, while the <b>direct</b> <b>producers</b> obtain {{only a small fraction of}} that final value.|$|R
5000|$|Marx {{says that}} {{primitive}} accumulation means the expropriation of the <b>direct</b> <b>producers,</b> {{and more specifically}} [...] "the dissolution of private property based on the labor of its owner... Self-earned private property, that is based, so to say, on the fusing together of the isolated, independent laboring-individual with the conditions of his labor, is supplanted by capitalistic private property, which rests on exploitation of the nominally free labor of others, i.e., on wage-labor" [...] (emphasis added).|$|R
50|$|In Vladimir Lenin's {{political}} theory, a classless {{society would}} be a society controlled by the <b>direct</b> <b>producers,</b> organized to produce according to socially managed goals. Such a society, Lenin suggested, would develop habits that would gradually make political representation unnecessary, as the radically democratic nature of the Soviets would lead citizens to come {{to agree with the}} representatives' style of management. Only in this environment, Lenin suggested, could the state wither away, ushering in a period of stateless communism.|$|R

"the {{specific}} economic form, {{in which}} unpaid surplus labour is pumped out of <b>direct</b> <b>producers,</b> determines {{the relationship of}} rulers and ruled, as it grows directly out of production itself and, in turn, reacts upon it as a determining element. Upon this, however, is founded the entire formation of the economic community which grows {{up out of the}} production relations themselves, thereby simultaneously its specific political form. It is always the direct relationship of the owners of the conditions of production to the <b>direct</b> <b>producers</b> - a relation always naturally corresponding to a definite stage of the methods of labour and thereby its social productivity - which reveals the innermost secret, the hidden basis of the entire social structure, and with it the political form of the relation of sovereignty and dependence, in short, the corresponding specific form of the state. This does not prevent the same economic basis - the same from the standpoint of its main conditions - due to innumerable different, empirical circumstances, natural environment, racial relations, external historical influence, etc. from showing infinite variations and gradations in appearance, which can be ascertained only by analysis of the empirically given circumstances." ...|$|R

50|$|Harvey’s {{interpretation}} {{has been}} criticized by Brass, who disputes the view that what is described as present-day primitive accumulation, or accumulation by dispossession, entails proletarianization. Because the latter is equated by Harvey with {{the separation of the}} <b>direct</b> <b>producer</b> (mostly smallholders) from the means of production (land), Harvey assumes this results in the formation of a workforce that is free. By contrast, Brass points out that in many instances the process of depeasantization leads to workers who are unfree, because they are unable personally to commodify or recommodify their labour-power, by selling it to the highest bidder.|$|R

50|$|If market trade {{consisted}} only {{of simple}} exchange (the exchange of things of equal value by the <b>direct</b> <b>producers</b> themselves), then balancing production effort, output and demand {{would be a}} fairly simple, straightforward matter. But in reality {{it is not so}} straightforward precisely because capitalist market trade is not simple exchange. Production effort, output and demand can be balanced in capitalism, only if sufficient profits are made and the accumulation of capital grows. In reality, products are constantly being sold above or below their value, according to what makes the best possible profit on the turnover, given market fluctuations.|$|R
