50|$|From August to September 1879 an {{observation}} tower, just under 9 metres high, was erected {{at the summit}} by the conservation societies of Annweiler and Landau. It was built as a cone-shaped pyramid using <b>dry</b> <b>mortarless</b> <b>construction.</b> The core of the tower was mostly made of rubble. A staircase led up {{the western side of}} the tower to the viewing platform on the top.In the 1960s the first stones worked loose as a result of age and in 1970 {{the eastern side of the}} tower collapsed. In 1971, DM 30,000 was invested in the building of an access track for motor vehicles and the rebuilding of the tower.|$|E
40|$|Interlocking {{compressed}} earth blocks (ICEB) are soil stabilized based {{blocks that}} allows for <b>mortarless</b> <b>construction.</b> Various {{studies have been conducted}} to improve the durability of bricks by using environmental friendly solution. This is because common method used by the construction industries generally involving the use of chemical based substances which will promote pollution to the surrounding. This paper provide the results of Ureolytic Bacteria (UB) in improving the compressive strength and water absorption properties with the percentage of 1 %, 3 % and 5 % UB for 7 th, 14 th and 28 th days of testing. The bacteria were added as partial replacement of limestone water in ICEB. The results of compressive strength and water absorption show that the increment of 15. 25 % strength and reduction of 15. 66 % water absorption with 5 % of UB on the 28 th days of testing compared to the control specimen. Therefore it is hoped that the positive results on using bacteria will continue to improve the durability of the ICEB as one of the environmental friendly solution in order to achieve sustainable construction...|$|R
