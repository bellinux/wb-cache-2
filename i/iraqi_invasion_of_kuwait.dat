5|$|On 2 August 1990, British Airways Flight 149 {{landed at}} Kuwait International Airport four {{hours after the}} <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> The aircraft, a Boeing 747-100 G-AWND, was destroyed, and all {{passengers}} and crew were captured. Two of the landing gears were salvaged, and are on display in Waterside, BA Headquarters in London.|$|E
5|$|No {{military}} operations {{were conducted by}} NATO during the Cold War. Following {{the end of the}} Cold War, the first operations, Anchor Guard in 1990 and Ace Guard in 1991, were prompted by the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> Airborne early warning aircraft were sent to provide coverage of southeastern Turkey, and later a quick-reaction force was deployed to the area.|$|E
5|$|RAF Uxbridge {{also became}} {{involved}} in Operation Granby following the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in August 1990. Personnel at Uxbridge were prepared for service in the Gulf at that time, and deployed that year in December. During the aerial assault on Iraq in January 1991, support group meetings began at the station {{for the families of}} service personnel serving during the Gulf War. Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, visited one of these groups in February 1991.|$|E
50|$|Abu Ghaith first gained {{attention}} {{during the}} 1990-1991 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> and occupation <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> His sermons denouncing the occupation and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein gained him {{some degree of}} popularity amongst the Kuwaiti people. The Kuwaiti government subsequently removed him from the mosque and banned him from giving sermons, and he became {{a high school teacher}} of religion.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> and {{occupation}} <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> was unanimously condemned by all major world powers. Even countries traditionally {{considered to be}} close Iraqi allies, such as France and India, called for immediate withdrawal of all Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Several countries, including the USSR and China, placed arms embargoes on Iraq. NATO members were particularly critical of the Iraqi occupation <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> and by late 1990, the United States had issued an ultimatum to Iraq to withdraw its forces from Kuwait by 15 January 1991 or face war.|$|R
50|$|Following the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> and {{occupation}} <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> {{at the start}} of August 1990, the United Nations imposed sanctions against Iraq, and asked that member nations contribute forces to help implement them. On 31 August, the Danish Parliament decided that a single ship, Olfert Fischer, would make up the Danish contribution. The corvette was to enforce the UN sanctions only; she was not to become involved in the developing Gulf War. She was accompanied and supported by a Norwegian supply ship. The Gulf War deployment, which ended in September 2001, was the first time a Danish warship had operated outside the European region. The deployment marked a change in Danish attitudes and actions towards international security and foreign policy.|$|R
5|$|The brigade {{was called}} to support the {{multinational}} response to the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> on 2 August 1990. The brigade grew to a 7,700 soldier force composed of three groups, ten battalions, four separate companies, and eight detachments in support of XVIII Airborne Corps during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. The brigade completed 1,500 combat heavy battalions equivalent days of work constructing roads, airfields, heliports, ammunition/fuel/water storage points, life support areas and forward landing strips, distributed over ten million maps, trained over 5,000 coalition engineers, and supported the French attack on Assalman airfield. During follow-on missions the brigade destroyed over 6,000 enemy bunkers and one million tons of munitions.|$|E
5|$|Following the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in August 1990, No.86 Wing {{prepared}} to deploy five C-130s to the Middle East to evacuate 3,000Australian citizens from Saudi Arabia {{in the event}} that Iraq also attacked that country. An operation to fly about 95Australians and New Zealanders directly out of Iraq and Kuwait was also planned, but would have only been conducted as a last resort due to the great dangers involved. These evacuation flights were not required as Iraq did not invade Saudi Arabia, and the Australians in Iraq departed by road. A proposal to deploy some of the Hercules as part of Australia's contribution to the ensuing Gulf War was also rejected in late 1990 as the aircraft had to be held in reserve in case fighting on the Pacific island of Bougainville worsened and required an evacuation operation. After Operation Desert Storm commenced in January 1991, two C-130s were dispatched to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in the Indian Ocean where they were held at readiness to deploy to Saudi Arabia in case Australian citizens had to be evacuated; these aircraft moved to Singapore on 29 January and returned to Australia in early February. Other Hercules flew supplies for the RAN warships in the region from Australia to Muscat, Oman, from January 1991, and also transported a naval Clearance Diving Team to Muscat late in the month. In 1992, the Hercules of Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons achieved a grand total of 500,000 accident-free flying hours; Lockheed presented No. 86 Wing with a trophy to commemorate the milestone.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, {{the fleet}} was {{regularly}} involved in crises; to deter an <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in 1962, in Tanganyika in 1964, and in Indonesia from 1964 to 1966. The Beira Patrol blocking oil supplies to Rhodesia began in 1965.|$|E
50|$|Following the Ba'athist <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> and {{occupation}} <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> during the Persian Gulf War, on August 2, 1990, Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah and {{senior members of}} his government fled to Saudi Arabia, where {{they set up a}} government-in-exile in Ta'if. The Kuwaiti government in exile was far more affluent than most other such governments, having full disposal of the very considerable Kuwaiti assets in western banks—of which it made use to conduct a massive propaganda campaign denouncing the Ba'athist Iraqi occupation and mobilizing public opinion in the western hemisphere in favor of war with Ba'athist Iraq. In March 1991, following the defeat of Ba'athist Iraq at the hands of coalition forces in the Persian Gulf War, the Sheikh and his government were able to return to Kuwait.|$|R

50|$|The Hawke Government {{committed}} Australian {{naval forces}} to the 1991 Gulf War {{in support of the}} United States led coalition against the Saddam Hussein <b>Iraqi</b> regime's <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> neighbouring <b>Kuwait.</b> Following the end of the Cold War, the 1990s was a busy period for United Nations peacekeeping missions, and the Keating Government committed Australian forces to various theatres: at one point during 1993, Australia had some 3000 peacekeepers committed to the field, including a large number in Cambodia and Somalia. Foreign Minister Gareth Evans had taken {{a leading role in the}} organisation of a peace settlement for Cambodia in the aftermath of the genocidal regime of Pol Pot and Australia contributed the force commander. While the United Nations intervention in Cambodia was largely successful, the Somali intervention ended poorly. The following year, the Rwandan Genocide commenced in Central Africa, and, following the Somali experience, the international community was this time slow to intervene. The Keating Government despatched medical staff to aid in the belated UN Mission to that nation.|$|R
25|$|Following the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in 1990, Saudi Arabia {{joined the}} anti-Iraq Coalition.

5000|$|Following the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> and {{occupation}} <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> {{there were reports}} of widespread looting. On September 2, 1990 {{in a letter to the}} UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, Kuwait's UN representative, Mohammad A. Abulhasan, wrote:Further to those of our communications which are intended to inform you of the actions perpetrated by the Iraqi occupation authorities in <b>Kuwait</b> in contravention <b>of</b> all international laws, and on the basis of confirmed information provided to us by the Government <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> we wish to draw attention to a phenomenon which has no precedent in history, namely, the Iraqi occupation authorities' organized operation for the purpose of looting and plundering Kuwait. It is impossible to compare this operation to any similar incidents or to provide an exact account thereof because it is in effect an operation designed to achieve nothing less than the complete removal <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait's</b> assets, including property belonging to the State, to public and private institutions and to individuals, as well as the contents of houses, factories, stores, hospitals, academic institutes, schools, and universities...What has occurred in Kuwait is the perpetration of an act of armed robbery by a State which has used its military, security and technical organs for that purpose.In the letter, Abulhasan also noted that [...] "theft of all equipment from private and public hospitals, including X-ray machines, scanners and pieces of laboratory equipment." [...] The allegations of looting were also retold by evacuees who described [...] "soldiers looting office buildings, schools and hospitals for air conditioners, computers, blackboards, desks, and even infant incubators and radiation equipment." [...] Douglas Hurd, the British Secretary for foreign affairs surmised that [...] "they are looting and destroying in a way which suggests that they may not expect to be there for very long." ...|$|R

25|$|Following the Soviet Union's {{withdrawal}} from Afghanistan in February 1989, bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia. The <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in August 1990 {{had put the}} Kingdom and its ruling House of Saud at risk. The world's most valuable oil fields were within easy striking distance of Iraqi forces in Kuwait, and Saddam's call to pan-Arab/Islamism could potentially rally internal dissent.|$|E
25|$|In the Middle East, {{faced by}} the 1958 {{collapse}} of the Baghdad Pact {{and the spread of}} Soviet influence, Macmillan acted decisively to restore the confidence of Persian Gulf allies, using the Royal Air Force and special forces to defeat a revolt backed by Saudi Arabia and Egypt against the Sultan of Oman, Said bin Taimur, in July 1957; deploying airborne battalions to defend Jordan against Syrian subversion in July 1958,; and deterring a threatened <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> by landing a brigade group in July 1960.|$|E

Sharif's government criticised Iraq for invading the fellow Muslim country, which strained Pakistan's relationships with Iraq.

25|$|During the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> on August 2, 1990 an Iraqi Air Force Sukhoi Su-22 {{from the}} No.109 Squadron (based at as-Shoibiyah AB) fired a single Kh-25MP anti-radar variant against a Kuwaiti MIM-23B I-HAWK SAM site at Bubiyan Island that had earlier downed another Su-22 {{from the same}} unit and a MiG-23BN from the 49th Squadron. This forced a radar {{shutdown}} on the HAWK. The HAWK battery (which was operated by some American contractors) was later captured by Iraqi special forces and found out to be in automatic mode of operation, after the contractors fled.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, Saudi Arabia spent $25 {{billion in}} support of Saddam Hussein in the Iran–Iraq War. However, Saudi Arabia {{condemned}} the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in 1990 and asked the US to intervene. King Fahd allowed American and coalition troops to be stationed in Saudi Arabia. He invited the Kuwaiti government {{and many of its}} citizens to stay in Saudi Arabia, but expelled citizens of Yemen and Jordan because of their governments' support of Iraq. In 1991, Saudi Arabian forces were involved both in bombing raids on Iraq and in the land invasion that helped to liberate Kuwait.|$|E

25|$|Ze'evi later {{advocated}} the population transfer by agreement of 3.3 million {{residents of the}} West Bank and Gaza to Arab nations.

In July 1987, Ze'evi presented his ideas at a forum in Tel Aviv, describing the plan as a voluntary transfer {{and the only way to}} make peace with the Arabs. After the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in 1990, Ze'evi proposed transferring Palestinians to the east side of the Jordan River to serve as a buffer zone against any Iraqi attempt to attack Israel.|$|E
25|$|A {{detachment}} of three Nimrod MR2s was deployed to Seeb in Oman in August 1990 {{as a result}} of the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> carrying out patrols over the Gulf of Oman and Persian Gulf. Due to the level of threats present in the Gulf theatre, operational Nimrods were quickly retrofitted with a Marconi-towed active decoy. Once hostilities commenced, the Nimrod detachment, by now increased to five aircraft, concentrated on night patrols, with daylight patrols carried out by US Navy Lockheed P-3 Orions. Nimrods were used to guide Westland Lynx helicopters and Grumman A-6 Intruder attack aircraft against Iraqi patrol vessels, being credited with assisting in sinking or damaging 16 Iraqi vessels.|$|E
25|$|In August 1990, Commander, U.S. Seventh Fleet was {{deployed}} to Bahrain {{in order to}} serve as Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Central Command (ComUSNAVCENT) following the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> Since ComUSNAVCENT operated from onboard ship, he established NAVCENT-Riyadh as a staff organization to provide continuous Navy representation at United States Central Command headquarters. This mission was assigned initially to Commander, Carrier Group Three. During succeeding months, the NAVCENT-Riyadh staff was augmented substantially but remained small, relative to the United States Army Central and CENTAF staffs. In November, the NAVCENT-Riyadh command was transferred from COMCARGRU 3 to Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Group 5.
