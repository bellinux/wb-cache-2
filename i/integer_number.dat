For the Sierpinski triangle, doubling its side creates 3 copies of itself. Thus the Sierpinski triangle has Hausdorff dimension log(3)/log(2)=log23≈1.585, which follows from solving 2d=3 for d.|$|E
25|$|Exeligmos: A triple saros, {{with the}} {{advantage}} {{that it has}} nearly an <b>integer</b> <b>number</b> of days, so the next eclipse will be visible at locations near the eclipse that occurred one exeligmos earlier, {{in contrast to the}} saros, in which the eclipse occurs about 8 hours later in the day or about 120° {{to the west of the}} eclipse that occurred one saros earlier.|$|E

Until now, cryptosystems used the <b>integer</b> <b>numbers</b> to avoid the fractions of the decimal numbers to avoid losing the original plaintext after the decryption. This theorem proved {{that there was no}} lost for any bit of information during communications when using a cryptosystem based on decimal numbers.

25|$|Triad: A triple inex, {{with the}} {{advantage}} {{that it has}} nearly an <b>integer</b> <b>number</b> of anomalistic months, which makes the circumstances between two eclipses one Triad apart very similar, but at the opposite latitude. Almost exactly 87 calendar years minus 2 months. The triad means that every third saros series will be similar (mostly total central eclipses or annular central eclipses for example). Saros 130, 133, 136, 139, 142 and 145, for example, all produce mainly total central eclipses.|$|E
25|$|The {{characteristic}} {{speed is}} the mean {{flow through the}} pipe U and the characteristic length must be a multiple of the spacing between corrugations, nL, where n is an <b>integer</b> <b>number</b> and L is the distance between corrugations. At low speeds, the unstable interior flow needs to travel several corrugations to establish the feedback loop. As the speed increases, the loop can be established with fewer corrugations. Simple tests were performed on the yellow plastic tube.|$|E
25|$|After one saros, the Moon {{will have}} {{completed}} roughly an <b>integer</b> <b>number</b> of lunar orbit cycles and synodic, draconic, and anomalistic periods (241, 223, 242, and 239) and the Earth-Sun-Moon geometry will be nearly identical: the Moon {{will have the}} same phase and be at the same node and the same distance from the Earth. In addition, because the saros is close to 18 years in length (about 11 days longer), the earth will be nearly the same distance from the sun, and tilted to it in nearly the same orientation (same season). Given the date of an eclipse, one saros later a nearly identical eclipse can be predicted. During this 18-year period, about 40 other solar and lunar eclipses take place, but with a somewhat different geometry. One saros equaling 18.03 years is not equal to a perfect <b>integer</b> <b>number</b> of lunar orbits (earth revolutions with respect to the fixed stars of 27.32166 days sidereal month), therefore, even though the relative geometry of the Earth–Sun–Moon system will be nearly identical after a saros, the Moon will be in a slightly different position with respect to the stars for each eclipse in a Saros series. The axis of rotation of the Earth–Moon system exhibits a precession period of 18.59992 years.|$|E

25|$|As can be seen, for λL = π/2 + nπ, with {{arbitrary}} <b>integer</b> <b>number</b> n, tan(λL) is infinite. n = 0 {{corresponds to}} the point of torsional divergence. For given structural parameters, this will correspond to a single value of free-stream velocity U. This is the torsional diverengence speed. Note that for some special boundary conditions that may be implemented in a wind tunnel test of an airfoil (e.g., a torsional restraint positioned forward of the centre of lift) it is possible to eliminate the phenomenon of divergence altogether.|$|E
25|$|U.S. {{customary}} {{units are}} widely used on consumer products and in industrial manufacturing. Metric units are standard in science, medicine, {{as well as many}} sectors of industry and government, including the military. There are anecdotal objections to the use of metric units in carpentry and the building trades, on the basis that it is easier to remember an <b>integer</b> <b>number</b> of inches plus a fraction than a measurement in millimeters, or that foot-inch measurements are more suitable when distances are frequently divided into halves, thirds and quarters, often in parallel. The metric system also lacks a parallel to the foot.|$|E
25|$|The cyclic prefix, {{which is}} {{transmitted}} during the guard interval, {{consists of the}} end of the OFDM symbol copied into the guard interval, and the guard interval is transmitted followed by the OFDM symbol. The reason that the guard interval consists of a copy {{of the end of}} the OFDM symbol is so that the receiver will integrate over an <b>integer</b> <b>number</b> of sinusoid cycles for each of the multipaths when it performs OFDM demodulation with the FFT. In some standards such as Ultrawideband, in the interest of transmitted power, cyclic prefix is skipped and nothing is sent during the guard interval. The receiver will then have to mimic the cyclic prefix functionality by copying the end part of the OFDM symbol and adding it to the beginning portion.|$|E

25|$|The most revolutionary {{aspect of}} Planck's {{treatment}} of the black body is that it inherently relies on an <b>integer</b> <b>number</b> of oscillators in thermal equilibrium with the electromagnetic field. These oscillators give their entire energy to the electromagnetic field, creating a quantum of light, {{as often as they}} are excited by the electromagnetic field, absorbing a quantum of light and beginning to oscillate at the corresponding frequency. Planck had intentionally created an atomic theory of the black body, but had unintentionally generated an atomic theory of light, where the black body never generates quanta of light at a given frequency with an energy less than hν. However, once realizing that he had quantized the electromagnetic field, he denounced particles of light as a limitation of his approximation, not a property of reality.|$|E
25|$|The random {{disorder}} in the potential {{landscape of the}} two-dimensional electron gas {{plays a key role}} in the observation of topological sectors and their instantons (phase transitions). Because of the disorder, the electrons are localized and thus they cannot flow across the sample. But if we consider a loop around a localized 2D electron, we can notice that current is still able to flow in the direction around this loop. This current is able to renormalize to larger scales and eventually becomes the Hall current that rotates along the edge of the sample. A topological sector corresponds to an <b>integer</b> <b>number</b> of rotations and it is now visible macroscopically, in the robustly quantized behavior of the measurable Hall current. If the electrons were not sufficiently localized, this measurement would be blurred out by the usual flow of current through the sample.|$|E
500|$|From his {{own work}} {{and the work of}} his {{students}} Bohr and Henry Moseley, Rutherford knew that the positive charge of any atom could always be equated to that of an <b>integer</b> <b>number</b> of hydrogen nuclei. This, coupled with the atomic mass of many elements being roughly equivalent to an <b>integer</b> <b>number</b> of hydrogen atoms - then assumed to be the lightest particles - led him to conclude that hydrogen nuclei were singular particles and a basic constituent of all atomic nuclei. He named such particles protons. Further experimentation by Rutherford found that the nuclear mass of most atoms exceeded that of the protons it possessed; he speculated that this surplus mass was composed of previously-unknown neutrally charged particles, which were tentatively dubbed [...] "neutrons".|$|E
