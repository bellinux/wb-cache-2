The only remaining unprotected areas are the SIMPLE IRA and the SEP IRA.

25|$|As black colored wolves occur more {{frequently}} in forested areas than on the tundra (black coats occur in about 62% of wolves in the forested areas of the Canadian Arctic, compared with about 7% in the icy tundra), melanism was concluded by the researchers to <b>give</b> <b>those</b> wolves an adaptive advantage. The mutation’s purpose {{has not yet been}} identified. Dr Barsh ruled out camouflage, as wolves have few natural predators, and {{there is no evidence that}} a black coat color leads to any increase in hunting success rates. Dr. Barsh observed that beta-defensin is involved in providing immunity to viral and bacterial skin infections, which might be more common in forested, warmer environments. It has been suggested that the mutation's association with forested habitats means that the prevalence of melanism should increase as forests expand northward. Dark fur is believed to be dominant in wolves. A mating between a black and a gray wolf resulted in ten pups with dark fur out of a total of fourteen.|$|E

500|$|Quarks, {{which make}} up {{composite}} particles like neutrons and protons, come in six [...] "flavours" [...] up, down, strange, charm, top and bottom [...] which <b>give</b> <b>those</b> composite particles their properties. The weak interaction is unique in that it allows for quarks to swap their flavour for another. The swapping of those properties is mediated by the force carrier bosons. For example, during beta minus decay, a down quark within a neutron is changed into an up quark, thus converting the neutron to a proton and resulting in the emission of an electron and an electron antineutrino. Also, the weak interaction is the only fundamental interaction that breaks parity-symmetry, and similarly, {{the only one to}} break charge parity symmetry.|$|E
500|$|Roughly a {{week before}} the {{supposed}} arrival of PlanetX in May 2003, Lieder appeared on KROQ-FM radio in Los Angeles, and advised listeners to euthanize their pets in anticipation of the event as she had done. This led the Fortean Times to conclude that she had put down her dog(s) to save them from further suffering during the Pole Shift. Later, in a 2004 interview she said that she had euthanized her dog because it was acting aggressively. After the 2003 date passed without incident, Lieder said that it was merely a [...] "white lie... to fool the establishment." [...] She refused to disclose the true date, saying that to do so would <b>give</b> <b>those</b> in power enough time to declare martial law and trap people in cities during the shift, leading to their deaths.|$|E
500|$|The new regular {{characters}} replaced outgoing {{cast members}} Melissa Leo and Max Perlich, {{who did not}} return for the sixth season. In the episode, Leo's character Kay Howard {{was said to be}} working full-time with the department's fugitive unit; actress Leo reportedly left the show so she could devote more time to her family. Perlich was allegedly fired from the series, and within the episode his character J. H. Brodie was said to have left police work after a documentary he filmed was aired on PBS and won an Emmy Award. Commentators said the Emmy mention, and a joke by Munch that [...] "they <b>give</b> <b>those</b> things to anybody", were references to the show's failure to secure a nomination for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series during its first five seasons.

500|$|Speaking {{about the}} XIII games in particular, Parish {{suggested}} that their mixed reactions influenced the title changes of other {{games in the}} original series, giving the teams a chance to <b>give</b> <b>those</b> games more of their own identity. He also felt {{that the decision to}} expand the XIII storyline into multiple games [...] "probably worked out just as well". The presentation of the mythos and its terms received mixed reactions in XIII, resulting in the production team toning down their use for XIII-2. Siliconera writer Spencer Yip, in his review of Lightning Returns, commented that the story and pace of the game was [...] "muddled" [...] by the mythos. In 2016, RPGFan writer Mike Salbato wrote a retrospective of the XIII games and their version of Fabula Nova Crystallis: he felt that the lack of specific references to the mythos in XIII had harmed general comprehension, and that a reliance on foreknowledge made its sequels difficult to play as standalone titles. In contrast, the portrayal of the mythos in Type-0 was praised by RPG Site's Erren Van Duine in an import review of the title, with him saying that [...] "elements such as l'Cie and fal'Cie are handled in much more interesting ways". When commenting on the lore of XV, Andrew Reiner of Game Informer praised the story for sticking to basics and avoiding [...] " [...] the player with lore or branching threads, something Final Fantasy XIII struggled with".|$|E
500|$|Despite Volition's {{interest}} {{and desire to}} develop add-ons and expansions for FreeSpace 2, Interplay told them to stop. Volition was then acquired by THQ in 2000. As Interplay owns {{the rights to the}} FreeSpace series (as well as the Descent series) and Volition's owners, THQ, is only interested in pursuing development on what they own, Volition was unable to continue developing the FreeSpace franchise. Faced with source code which became practically useless to them, Volition released the source code for only game engines to the public under a noncommercial license on April 25, 2002. Mike Kulas, the President of Volition, said this was to <b>give</b> <b>those</b> outside the game industry {{a chance to look at}} the code of a commercial software product, a desire he and Matt Toschlog had when they were not yet in the industry. In the years since, no sequels to FreeSpace 2 have been made and Interplay has only published a limited re-release of it on February 2, 2004, to commemorate the company's 20th anniversary. [...] Interplay, by that time, was in financial trouble, failing to pay rent and wages to its workers. [...] Seeking investors to inject it with funds, Interplay changed business strategies: instead of developing and publishing single-player games, it sold licenses to those games and looked towards developing massive multi-player online games. Derek Smart, creator of Battlecruiser 3000AD, had casually mentioned his interest in the Freespace license, but nothing significant came out of this. In 2013, Interplay acquired the remaining rights to the FreeSpace franchise for $7,500 after THQ went to bankruptcy court.|$|E
500|$|Barnes {{returned}} for the subsequent fixture against Surrey at The Oval in London, where Australia won the toss and batted first. Barnes attacked immediately, {{and put on}} an opening partnership of 136 with Morris, before the latter fell. Bradman and Barnes put on another 207 for the second wicket before Barnes fell for 176. The tourists continued {{to build on the}} foundation laid by the top order and were eventually bowled out for 632. Bradman’s bowlers dismissed Surrey for 141 and 195 to win by an innings after enforcing the follow on. During the match, Barnes was involved in an oft-recalled incident. After a series of Australian appeals had been turned down in the match against Leicestershire by umpire Alec Skelding, Barnes had remonstrated with him and told him he had problems with his eyesight. Barnes also complained about Skelding adjudging him lbw, saying the ball [...] "wouldn't have hit another set of stumps" [...] and telling the umpire to get a guide dog. A stray dog ran onto the field during the Surrey game. It caused a stoppage in play by evading the players and police for a few minutes. Eventually, Barnes used the ball to bait and trap the dog, which he then [...] presented to Skelding stating: [...] "You must need a dog. You're blind when you <b>give</b> <b>those</b> decisions [...] not out" [...] and [...] "Now all you want is a white stick". Skelding refused the offer, and after Barnes continued to pressure him into taking the dog, he called for an adjournment and left the playing arena.

2500|$|Nixon {{developed}} a [...] "Southern strategy" [...] {{that was designed}} to appeal to conservative white southerners, who traditionally voted Democratic, but were opposed to Johnson and Humphrey's support for the civil rights movement, as well as the rioting that had broken out in the ghettos of most large cities. Wallace, however, won over many of the voters Nixon targeted, effectively splitting the conservative vote. Indeed, Wallace deliberately targeted many states he had little chance of carrying himself in the hope that by splitting the conservative vote with Nixon he would <b>give</b> <b>those</b> states to Humphrey and, by extension, boost his own chances of denying both opponents an Electoral College majority.|$|E
