50|$|Osier {{was where}} six {{snowmobile}} riders sought refuge after becoming {{lost in the}} Colorado backcountry in early January 2008. A snowstorm and threat of avalanche delayed rescuers, and the two families in the group broke into the kitchen where they found popcorn, chicken bouillon and <b>gravy</b> <b>mix,</b> keeping them alive until help could arrive.|$|E
5000|$|Spatini {{spaghetti}} sauce mix was originally developed and marketed by Russell G. Lakoff and Harry Seidman of Overbrook Hills, Pennsylvania, who registered their business in Philadelphia as Spatini Co. on September 4, 1952, selling the dry powdered mix packaged in boxes of three packets. Early packages of Spatini {{spaghetti sauce}} mix {{state that the}} Spatini Company was based in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. The Spatini Co. also manufactured a brown <b>gravy</b> <b>mix</b> that was sold under the Spatini brand. [...] In 1962, Spatini spaghetti sauce added a version with tomatoes already included.|$|E

5000|$|Seremban is {{also well}} known for its Nasi Padang or Minangkabau dishes. It is {{basically}} a meal of rice eaten with dishes of recipe which originated from Padang, Sumatra.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to formulate low-fat gravy mixes for curries using oilseeds, which are known to function as natural emulsifiers, namely cashew nuts, and sesame, watermelon and poppy seeds. The functionality of oilseeds was determined in terms of water- and fat-absorption capacities and emulsifying properties. These oilseeds were used as oil replacements in the preparation of vegetable- or legume-based curries. Traditional oil-based samples served as a control for comparison of quality. The prepared curries were analysed for fat content and sensory attributes. A part of the <b>gravy</b> <b>mix</b> was also frozen and used after 30 days for the preparation of legume-based curry. Results revealed that the fat content of oilseeds ranged from 48 to 53 %; protein content, 17 – 29 %; emulsification capacity, 58 – 62 %; and emulsion stability, 200 – 233 %. Formulated gravy mixes resulted in 70 – 80 % lesser oil in curries in comparison with the control. The sensory attributes of low-fat vegetable curry were similar to those of the control; however, low-fat legume-based preparations were found to have significantly lower sensory quality. In curries made out of frozen curry mixes, the sensory attributes of cashew nut-based curry were similar to those of the control. It can be concluded that natural emulsifiers or oilseeds can be used as oil replacements in the preparation of low-fat <b>gravy</b> <b>mix</b> for Indian curries...|$|E

French {{manufactured}} a complete line of spices and extracts, mustard and condiments, pickle products, sauce and <b>gravy</b> <b>mixes,</b> instant potato products, and pet care products. The company also owned Widmer Wine Cellars. French’s Potato Pancake mix was {{once one of}} the company’s most popular products.

5|$|Rice, pasta, and potato-based foods (french {{fries and}} mashed potato) also make {{up part of}} Zimbabwean cuisine. A local {{favourite}} is rice cooked with peanut butter, which is taken with thick <b>gravy,</b> <b>mixed</b> vegetables and meat. A potpourri of peanuts known as nzungu, boiled and sundried maize, black-eyed peas known as nyemba, and bambara groundnuts known as nyimo makes a traditional dish called mutakura. Mutakura can also be the above ingredients cooked individually. One can also find local snacks, such as maputi (roasted/popped maize kernels similar to popcorn), roasted and salted peanuts, sugar cane, sweet potato, pumpkin, and indigenous fruits, such as horned melon, gaka, adansonia, mawuyu, uapaca kirkiana, mazhanje (sugar plum), and many others.|$|R
50|$|Pot pies with a flaky {{crust and}} bottom {{are also a}} popular American dish, {{typically}} with a filling of meat (particularly beef, chicken, or turkey), <b>gravy,</b> and <b>mixed</b> vegetables (potatoes, carrots, and peas). Frozen pot pies are often sold in individual serving size.|$|R

50|$|Kodi (Chicken) Koora and Mutton (Lamb) koora are two popular dishes, {{often made}} with range of spices and condiments. The gravy base is usually Onions, Tomato, Coriander, Tamarind and Coconut. These <b>gravies</b> are <b>mixed</b> with steamed rice {{on the plate}} during lunch. Also pepper is used for fried meat dishes. Popular dishes served {{commonly}} in Andhra-style restaurants include the spicy, Andhra Chilli Chicken, Chicken Roast, and Mutton Pepper Fry. Among seafood Tamarind base is widely used. The state's large shrimp farming makes shrimp and prawns widely available.|$|R
40|$|Acid-hydrolysed {{vegetable}} protein (acid-HVP) commonly manufactured by hydrolysis of pro-tein-rich vegetable materials with hydrochloric acid {{was introduced in}} 1886 and since then has been regularly used as a food seasoning and in-gredient of savoury foods such as soups, sauces, <b>gravy</b> <b>mixes,</b> bouillon cubes, soya sauce, etc. Since 1978, several chlorine-containing C 3 alcohols (commonly called chloropropanols) have been found as contaminants of acid-HVP (V����� � et al. 1978). The principal chloropropanol found in the traditionally processed acid-HVP is 3 -MCPD (3 -chloropropane- 1, 2 -diol), first identified in model experiments with lipids hydrolysed by hydrochloric acid in 1979 (V����� � et al. 1979; D����� � et al. 1980) and then in acid-HVP in 1981 (D����� � et al. 1982). Its enantiomers, i. e. (R) - 3 -MCPD and (S) - 3 -MCPD, {{have been found in}} the acid-HVP as a racemic mixture quite recently (V����� � et al. 2002). As a consequence, manufacturers have been modifying their production processes to reduce the levels of 3 -MCPD in acid-HVP. Based on the findings of numerous toxicological studies, the European Commission Scientific Commit-tee for Food concluded in 1995 that 3 -MCPD should be regarded as a genotoxic carcinogen (EC Scientific Commi�ee for Food 1995). Because of the potential hazards to human health, the limit of 1 mg/kg 3 -MCP...|$|R
