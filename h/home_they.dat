5|$|The Parson is {{a feisty}} and {{energetic}} type of Terrier. They can excel in dog {{sports such as}} flyball or agility and require vigorous exercise {{in order to prevent}} them from becoming bored and potentially destructive in the <b>home.</b> <b>They</b> can be suited to live with children but as they have a typical Terrier temperament, they will not tolerate rough handling. The AKC describes them as being single minded, tenacious and courageous when at work, while at <b>home</b> <b>they</b> can be exuberant, playful and affectionate. However, it is unusual for dogs of this breed to be involved in work, such as fox hunting, typical of a small white terrier, as they are more adapted to the show bench.|$|E
5|$|Andorra's first {{official}} game was a 6–1 defeat {{in a friendly}} match to Estonia in 1996. Since the qualifying rounds for the UEFA Euro 2000 tournament, Andorra have competed in qualifying for every European Championship and World Cup but have had very little success. They have only ever won five matches, four of them at <b>home.</b> <b>They</b> have two wins in competitive matches, 1–0 wins against Macedonia in the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying competition and against Hungary in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying competition.|$|E

5|$|Democrats ran {{a strong}} {{candidate}} in former lieutenant governor John G. Warwick. To drive their point <b>home,</b> <b>they</b> hired young partisans {{to pretend to}} be peddlers, who went door to door offering 25-cent tinware to housewives for 50 cents, explaining the rise in prices was due to the McKinley Tariff. In the end, McKinley lost by 300 votes, but the Republicans won a statewide majority and claimed a moral victory.|$|E
5|$|Fiorentina, of Serie A, {{entered the}} tournament in the Last 16 {{at home to}} Chievo, also of their league. They won 2–0 with first-half goals from Joaquín and Ante Rebić, despite the {{dismissal}} of Massimo Ambrosini. In the quarter-final on 23 January, again at <b>home,</b> <b>they</b> beat Serie B Siena 2–1 with Josip Iličić opening the scoring and Marvin Compper scoring the winner. Fiorentina's semi-final against Udinese began with a 2–1 away defeat on 4 February, but the second leg on 12 February was a 2–0 home victory with goals from Manuel Pasqual and Cuadrado.|$|E
5|$|Kerr's first {{marriage}} was to Squadron Leader Anthony Bartley RAF on 29 November 1945. They had two daughters, Melanie Jane (born 27 December 1947) and Francesca Ann (born 20 December 1951 and subsequently {{married to the}} actor John Shrapnel). The marriage was troubled, owing to Bartley's jealousy of his wife's fame and financial success, and because her career often took her away from <b>home.</b> <b>They</b> divorced in 1959.|$|E

The 69-year-old Houston was in his final days and physically feeble, requiring {{the use of a}} cane to get around. Until daughter Maggie took over as his personal assistant, his wife shouldered the duties. Even so, during this period, he managed to get the Confederate War Department to discharge all draftees from the Alabama-Coushatta tribe, which had distanced itself completely from the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, two Bristol Blenheims of No. 114 Squadron RAF made {{an attack}} on Frecamp and Dieppe, {{dropping}} bombs from high altitude. The Germans recorded no damage at Frecamp, and the attack on Dieppe seems to have gone unnoticed. As the bombers headed <b>home,</b> <b>they</b> passed two Spitfires of the Photographic Reconnaissance Unit (PRU). These high-speed aircraft had been stripped of non-essential weight such as armament and radios and were fitted with cameras and extra fuel tanks. They photographed ports and airfields and then returned.|$|E

5|$|The 44th Bombardment Group {{took part}} in an even more costly raid, {{the attack on the}} Romanian Ploesti oil fields, on 1 August 1943. When Johnson arrived at the target leading his group, he found that the 93d Bombardment Group had already {{attacked}} their target by mistake, and as a consequence, the defenders were alert. Although he would have been justified in turning back, Johnson led his group in through thick smoke, flak and explosions that concealed the tall smokestacks and barrage balloon cables. On the way <b>home,</b> <b>they</b> had to fight off Me109 fighters.|$|E

By virtue of their two season-opening wins, the Hokies were ranked No. 21 in the coaches' poll, and they improved that ranking with a win in the first overtime football game in Virginia Tech history, 2720.|$|E

5|$|The couple {{moved into}} a very basic ground-floor {{apartment}} in London, on Clarendon Road, Notting Hill.

In 1955 the four of them bought a four-storey, seven-bedroom house in Phillimore Place, Kensington, for ₤6,800, a <b>home</b> <b>they</b> lived in together for 14 years. Williams described it as one of the happiest periods of his life.|$|E

5|$|Although sea lochs are the boobries' natural <b>home</b> <b>they</b> will shelter on land in {{overgrown}} heather. Accounts {{are inconsistent}} {{as to the}} extent of the boobrie's habitat. Campbell of Islay claims that it is specific to the lochs of Argyllshire, as does Emeritus Professor of English James MacKillop. The writers Katharine Briggs and Patricia Monaghan on the other hand consider the creature's range to be the broader Scottish Highlands, although Briggs does sometimes specify Argyllshire. Campbell of Islay's undated manuscript notes the boobrie had not been seen for several years probably due to the widespread burning of heather in the area of its habitat.|$|E
5|$|Among the ECSC's {{greatest}} achievements {{are those}} on welfare issues. Some mines, for example, were clearly unsustainable without government subsidies. Some miners had extremely poor housing. Over 15 years it financed 112,500 flats for workers, paying US$1,770 per flat, enabling workers {{to buy a}} <b>home</b> <b>they</b> could not have otherwise afforded. The ECSC also paid half the occupational redeployment costs of those workers {{who have lost their}} jobs as coal and steel facilities began to close down. Combined with regional redevelopment aid the ECSC spent $150million creating 100,000 jobs, a third of which were for unemployed coal and steel workers. The welfare guarantees invented by the ECSC were extended to workers outside the coal and steel sector by some of its members.|$|E
