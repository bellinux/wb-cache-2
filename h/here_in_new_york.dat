She told The New York Times, [...] "I {{was a completely}} normal weight, but I was <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City, I had money and I couldn't buy any clothes. After I lost weight, there was interest in putting me on camera." [...] In 1999, McKay stepped down as head writer, which led Michaels to approach Fey for the position. She became SNLs first female head writer.|$|E
500|$|The {{election}} of Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) in 1932 quelled the public affection for dictators. As the country became increasingly enthralled with FDR, who {{was featured in}} countless newsreels, it exhibited less desire for alternative forms of government. Many Hollywood films reflected this new optimism. Heroes for Sale, despite being a tremendously bleak and at times anti-American film, ends {{on a positive note}} as the New Deal appears as a sign of optimism. When Wild Boys of the Road (1933), directed by William Wellman, reaches its conclusion, a dispossessed juvenile delinquent is in court expecting a jail sentence. However the judge lets the boy go free, revealing to him the symbol of the New Deal behind his desk, and tells him [...] "hings are going to be better here now, not only <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> but all over the country." [...] A box-office casualty of this hopefulness was Gabriel Over the White House, which entered production during the Hoover era malaise and sought to capitalize on it. By the time the film was released on March 31, 1933, FDR's election had produced a level of hopefulness in America that rendered the film's message obsolete.*Black, pg. 144.|$|E

500|$|Before All My Children {{offered him}} {{the role of}} Dimitri Marick, Nader already planned on working in both Los Angeles and New York.

[...] "She had an apartment here and I had been seeking out some theater <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> {{and would have been}} spending time both here and in L.A. So after we made the decision to go ahead with that game plan, this offer (Dimitri) came on the table and when we worked out all the figures moneywise it was a great opportunity." [...] Despite Nader's prime time success as Dynasty's Dex Dexter, he did not look down on daytime television. [...] "The {{fact of the matter is}} we're in a different era," [...] he said. [...] "And if you look at the cutbacks in Hollywood, being on a soap is not of any less or more value than being in any other medium at this time." [...] Another factor that contributed to his decision to join All My Children was the actors strike. He intended to stay on All My Children for a year. That year turned into more because the actor fell in love with New York.|$|E
