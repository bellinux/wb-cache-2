5|$|Webster {{herself was}} characterised as malicious, {{reckless}} and wilfully evil. Commentators saw her crime as both gruesome and scandalous. Servants {{were expected to}} be deferential; <b>her</b> <b>act</b> of extreme violence towards her employer was deeply disquieting. At the time, about 40% of the female labour force was employed as domestic servants for a very wide range of society, from the wealthiest to respectable working-class families. Servants and employers lived and worked in close proximity, and the honesty and orderliness of servants was a constant cause of concern. Servants were very poorly paid and larceny was an ever-present temptation. Had Webster succeeded in completing the deal with John Church to sell Thomas' furniture, she stood to gain the equivalent of two to three years' worth of wages.|$|E

25|$|Mata Hari {{brought a}} {{carefree}} provocative style {{to the stage}} in <b>her</b> <b>act,</b> which garnered wide acclaim. The most celebrated segment of <b>her</b> <b>act</b> was her progressive shedding of clothing until she wore just a jeweled bra and some ornaments upon her arms and head. She was seldom seen without a bra as she was self-conscious about being small-breasted. She wore a bodystocking for her performances that was similar in color to her own skin.|$|E

25|$|Although this {{statutory}} definition broadly corresponds to its common law counterpart, {{there are two}} key differences. First, unlike the common law offence which requires evidence of a seditious intent, an offender's intention is irrelevant under the Sedition Act, and it suffices that the act possesses the requisite seditious tendency. Thus, it is immaterial that the offender failed to foresee or misjudged the risk that his or <b>her</b> <b>act</b> would be seditious.|$|E
25|$|Promiscuous, flirtatious, {{and openly}} flaunting her body, Mata Hari captivated her audiences {{and was an}} {{overnight}} success from the debut of <b>her</b> <b>act</b> at the Musée Guimet on 13 March 1905.

25|$|The {{breach of}} secrecy around Bentley's {{defection}} foiled a year-long attempt by the FBI to have <b>her</b> <b>act</b> as a double agent. Additionally, because of the shutdown of Soviet espionage activity, the FBI surveillance of the agents Bentley had named turned up no evidence {{that could be used}} to prosecute them. Some 250 FBI agents were assigned to the Bentley case, following up the leads she had provided and, through phone tap, surveillance and mail openings, investigating people she had named. The FBI, grand juries and congressional committees would eventually interview many of these alleged spies, but all of them would either invoke their Fifth Amendment right not to testify or maintain their innocence.|$|E

25|$|Consistent {{with her}} early career, Cox's style leaned more toward {{vaudeville}} than blues.

At {{the height of the}} classic female blues era, competition was stiff, with numerous talented blueswomen performing, and Cox's singing was only part of <b>her</b> <b>act.</b> Nevertheless, as her career developed, she assumed and embodied the title bestowed on her, “The Uncrowned Queen of the Blues”. Onstage, she exuded a glamorous sophistication and confidence that captivated her fans. She also embellished her stage presence with a stylish wardrobe, which often included a tiara, cape and rhinestone wand.|$|E

On a later episode, Aoki appeared with Silverman and stated he did not accept Silverman's explanation, {{saying that it was}} not successful satire and that comedians should consult groups such as his before performing such material. She stated in an NPR Fresh Air interview that she was asked to repeat the joke on Politically Incorrect, among other places, but eventually dropped it from <b>her</b> <b>act</b> because she felt it was becoming stale.|$|E

In June 2012, {{it was confirmed that}} Brown would become a guest judge for the Manchester auditions of the British version of The X Factor alongside Louis Walsh, Gary Barlow and Tulisa Contostavlos. It was confirmed in March 2013 that Brown would judge Australia's Got Talent along with fellow Brit Dawn French. The same month, it was confirmed that Brown would not return as a judge for the fifth season of The X Factor due to her commitments with Australia's Got Talent. Brown was replaced by Dannii Minogue. On 9 April 2013, the Australian Associated Press reported that Brown was off the chain and banned from judging on Australia's Got Talent after Seven, the Australian TV network that airs The X Factor, filed suit to prevent Brown from appearing on any rival networks. The judge ruled that Brown was still under contract with Seven until January 2014, thus preventing her from appearing on a program aired by another network until after that date. The Nine Network confirmed rumours on 29 April that they had hired former fellow Spice Girl Geri Halliwell to replace Brown.|$|E
