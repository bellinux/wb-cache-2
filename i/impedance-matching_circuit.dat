The RF-FET combines a nanometer-scale silicon FET with an <b>impedance-matching</b> <b>circuit</b> composed of an inductor and capacitor. Driving the RF-FET with a carrier signal at its resonance frequency, small signals at the transistor's gate modulate the impedance of the resonant circuit, which is monitored at high speed using the reflected signal.

40|$|Abstract:- Recently, spiral {{inductors}} have widely {{been used}} in the design of matching circuits of a wireless transceiver. However, such elements usually have low quality factor (Q) and may encounter the self-resonance in microwave-frequency band which permits its use in higher frequencies, and on the other hand, they occupy the large on-chip space. This paper presents a new design theory for the <b>impedance-matching</b> <b>circuits</b> for a single-chip SiGe BiCMOS receiver front-end for 5 GHz-band WLAN. The presented matching circuits are composed of conductor-backed coplanar waveguide (CPW) meanderline resonators and impedance (K) inverter. The prototype power amplifier (PA) is fabricated and measured. A few of the measured results to verify the design theory are presented...|$|R

Special attention is given to the application of such devices on board of luxury yachts, where the use of power line communications could dramatically reduce weights and costs.

40|$|Biological tissue healing has {{recently}} attracted {{a great deal}} of research interest in various medical fields. Trauma to teeth, deep and root caries, and orthodontic treatment can all lead to various degrees of root resorption. In our previous study, we showed that low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) enhances the growth of lower incisor apices and accelerates their rate of eruption in rabbits by inducing dental tissue growth. We also performed clinical studies and demonstrated that LIPUS facilitates the healing of orthodontically induced teeth-root resorption in humans. However, the available LIPUS devices are too large to be used comfortably inside the mouth. In this paper, the design and implementation of a low-power LIPUS generator is presented. The generator is the core of the final intraoral device for preventing tooth root loss and enhancing tooth root tissue healing. The generator consists of a power-supply subsystem, an ultrasonic transducer, an <b>impedance-matching</b> <b>circuit,</b> and an integrated circuit composed of a digital controller circuitry and the associated driver circuit. Most of our efforts focus on the design of the <b>impedance-matching</b> <b>circuit</b> and the integrated system-on-chip circuit. The chip was designed and fabricated using 0. 8 -mu m high-voltage technology from Dalsa Semiconductor, Inc. The power supply subsystem and its impedance-matching network are implemented using discrete components. The LIPUS generator was tested and verified to function as designed and is capable of producing ultrasound power up to 100 mW {{in the vicinity of the}} transducer 2 ̆ 7 s resonance frequency at 1. 5 MHz.

40|$|Noise {{is defined}} as random {{fluctuations}} of a signal in time. The fundamental requirement for noise {{is some sort of}} randomness. Noise is well-known and infamous to every experimentalist - whether he is working in the field of electronics, optics, acoustics or anywhere else - since such fluctuations are inherent and unavoidable in many systems. For most of us, the word noise has a negative connotation. It is considered to be an unwanted disturbance superposed on a useful signal, which tends to obscure the signal's information. The natural reaction to this nuisance is trying to reduce it as much as possible, be it with a longer averaging time or an improved setup. In this respect, the signal-to-noise ratio, which compares the level of the desired signal with the level of the superposed noise, is the relevant quantity. A signal-to-noise level larger than one has to be achieved in order to observe the requested signal. In fact, noise is often a limiting factor in experiments and there are many examples where a reduced noise level led to the revelation of unexpected features. In this sense, noise seems to be a tedious, annoying matter and it is a fair question to ask why one would make it the topic of an entire thesis. While noise is primarily an experimental affair, theoretical studies on the statistics of these fluctuations have been carried out for a long time, too. These studies draw an interesting picture. Measuring the average current through a system delivers partial information on the mechanisms responsible for conduction. But a more complete description and further information on the conduction mechanisms are given by the probability distribution of the current, containing both the average current and its fluctuations. Even though the fluctuations appear randomly, they are caused by well-defined processes like the thermal motion of charges, the discreteness of charge carriers and the probabilistic character of scattering. Each noise source exhibits distinct characteristics. Measuring the noise properties of a system and knowing the underlying process, one might be able to infer complementary insight beyond what is possible with the mean current. Hence, a profound knowledge of the noise processes does not only help to find a way for reducing the noise level, but can also be used as a diagnostic tool. It was Einstein who realised in 1909 that electromagnetic fluctuations differ if the energy is carried by waves or particles. He derived a linear relation between the mean energy and the corresponding fluctuations for waves, whereas the fluctuations scale with the square root of the mean energy for particles. Another example where fluctuations can provide information about the charge carriers was proposed by Schottky in 1918 in the context of vacuum tubes. Shot noise (which is not a dangerous effect at all despite its name) arises from the granularity of charge and therefore scales with the unit of charge. Indeed, the doubled charge of Cooper pairs and the fractional charge of Laughlin quasiparticles appearing in the fractional quantum Hall state was confirmed in this way. In 1928, the dependence of fluctuations due to thermal agitation was studied experimentally by Johnson and theoretically by Nyquist. In the following, the extrapolation of thermal noise to zero amplitude was used to determine the absolute zero of temperature and a value for the Boltzmann constant was deduced from the temperature dependence of thermal noise. Typical currents that occur in nanoelectronics are tiny. Current fluctuations coming from these samples are even smaller and more challenging to detect and one has {{to come up with a}} clever measurement scheme. We are mainly interested in shot noise, whose spectral density is frequency-independent up to a few gigahertz. In contrast, electronic components add an undesired noise contribution, which is inversely proportional to the frequency f. At gigahertz frequencies, the amplitude of this 1 /f-noise is considerably reduced. Moreover, measuring at high frequencies has a second advantage. Higher frequencies enable us to measure with a larger bandwidth and consequently to acquire more signal. For these reasons, we started the noise project by building up a microwave measurement scheme. Our main interest lies in noise studies of high-resistance mesoscopic devices, such as quantum dots. However, the combination of high-frequency measurements with impedances on the order of R = 100 kOhm suffers from the large impedance mismatch to the standard characteristic impedance of the measurement line, Z 0 = 50 Ohm. According to voltage division, the suppression of detectable signal power on the 50 Ohm side is on the order of (Z_ 0 /R) ^ 2. Hence, there is a solution needed to enhance the transmission from the device to the instrument. This is achieved with impedance matching, for which we use a so-called stub <b>impedance-matching</b> <b>circuit.</b> It is a resonant circuit based on transmission lines. This thesis about noise detection with a stub <b>impedance-matching</b> <b>circuit</b> is structured as follows: It starts in chapter 2 with an introduction to the characteristics of microwave transmission lines, which are the building blocks of the later used microwave circuit. The development of carbon nanotube samples with an integrated stub <b>impedance-matching</b> <b>circuit</b> for noise detection as well as building up the high-frequency measurement setup were important experimental parts of this PhD project. For this reason, it is documented in detail in the thesis. A description of the stub impedance-matching circuit's properties is found in chapter 3. It also mentions impedance matching with an LC circuit and ends with a comparison of the two approaches. All fabrication considerations and recipes are collected in chapter 4. Chapter 5 gives an overview of the measurement setup, which is partially inside a dilution refrigerator. The remaining two chapters are devoted to results from a quantum dot formed in a carbon nanotube. Chapter 6 discusses RF reflectometry in the presence of a stub <b>impedance-matching</b> <b>circuit.</b> It is shown how to extract the circuit parameters and the device impedances from the reflection spectrum. Finally, noise measurements and their analysis are presented in chapter 7. The good agreement of our noise data in the single quantum dot regime with previous studies is a confirmation that the developed methods for noise detection with stub impedance matching and for calibration are well suited and allow for accurate noise results...|$|E
40|$|Two {{monolithic}} microwave {{integrated circuits}} (MMICs) {{have been designed}} and built to function together {{as a source of}} electromagnetic radiation at a frequency of 120 GHz. One of the MMICs is an oscillator and is the highest-power 120 -GHz oscillator reported thus far in the literature. The other MMIC is an end-fire antenna that radiates the oscillator signal. Although these MMICs were constructed as separate units and electrically connected with wire bonds, future oscillator/ antenna combinations could readily be fabricated as monolithic integrated units. Such units could be used as relatively high-power solid-state microwave sources in diverse applications that include automotive radar, imaging, scientific instrumentation, communications, and radio astronomy. As such, these units would be attractive alternatives to vacuum-tube oscillators, which are still used to obtain acceptably high power in the frequency range of interest. The oscillator (see figure) includes a high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT), with gate-periphery dimensions of 4 by 37 m, in a common-source configuration. The series feedback element of the oscillator is a grounded coplanar waveguide (CPW) at the source. The HEMT is biased for class-A operation (meaning that current is conducted throughout the oscillation cycle) to maximize the output power of the oscillator. Input and output <b>impedance-matching</b> <b>circuit</b> elements are designed to maximize output power and to establish the conditions needed for oscillation. The design of the antenna takes advantage of surface waves, which, heretofore, have been regarded as highly disadvantageous because they can leak power and degrade the performances of antennas that have not been designed to exploit them. Measures taken to suppress surface waves have included complex machining of circuit substrates and addition of separate substrates. These measures are difficult to implement in standard MMIC fabrication processes. In contrast, because the design of the present antenna eliminates the need to suppress surface waves, the fabrication of the antenna is fully compatible with standard MMIC fabrication processes...|$|E
