40|$|Supported by the CGIAR System-wide Livestock ProgrammeCowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) is an {{important}} food legume and {{an integral part of}} traditional cropping systems in the semi-arid regions of the tropics. The estimated worldwide area under cowpea is about 14 million ha of which West Africa alone accounts for about 9. 3 million ha with annual production of about 2. 9 Mt. Cowpea grains are consumed as food and the <b>haulms</b> are fed to livestock as a nutritious fodder. Farmers often grow a short-duration spreading variety for grain and a long-duration spreading variety for fodder, but the grain and fodder yields are poor due to low yield potential of the spreading varieties and also due to early cessation of rains. Therefore, IITA in collaboration with ILRI has initiated a systematic programme to develop medium-maturing, semi-erect, dual-purpose varieties with higher grain and fodder yields and with enhanced fodder quality. By crossing the late, traditional spreading varieties with improved early, semi-erect varieties, a semi-erect group of medium-maturing, dual-purpose varieties has been developed which yield over 1. 5 t ha− 1 grain and 2. 5 t ha− 1 <b>haulms.</b> Despite the high grain and fodder yields, the <b>haulms</b> of improved dual-purpose varieties have similar crude protein content (17 – 18 %) and dry matter digestibility (64 – 71 %) compared to the local varieties.

50|$|PLRV infects {{members of}} the Solanaceae family. The most {{economically}} important host is the Potato, Solanum tuberosum spp. In potato, symptoms of primary infection, infection in the growing season, occurs in the youngest leaves. Leaf margins become necrotic, turning brown and purplish and curl inwards towards {{the center of the}} leaf. Secondary infection, which starts from infected potato culls, produces more severe symptoms. Leaf rolling is more apparent and the entire leaf can become chlorotic and sometimes also has a purple discoloration. Necrosis of the phloem tissue particularly in the <b>haulm</b> is observed after onset of symptoms. Plants infected with PLRV experience stunted growth and produce smaller tubers. Infected tubers retain normal shape but experience necrosis of the vascular tissue. Necrosis of the tuber may not be apparent at harvest and can develop in storage. This usually appears as small brown spots scattered throughout the tissue.Net necrosis of potato is the result of infection by potato leaf roll virus (PLRV). This symptom is caused by the selective death and damage to cells in the vascular tissues of the tuber. The fact that only specific cells within the tuber are affected by this problem while others remain normal causes the characteristic net symptom. Infection by the virus may directly cause the damage to and death of the vascular tissues or the presence of the virus may make these sensitive tissues more susceptible to damage from other stresses. There is a strong resemblance between PLRV net necrosis and another tuber defect known as stem end discoloration (SED). Unlike PLRV, SED is believed to be a physiological disorder.|$|E
40|$|Two feeding {{trials were}} {{conducted}} to study the combined effects of (i) varying degrees of selective consumption and (ii) supplementation with cowpea (Trail 1) or groundnut <b>haulms</b> (Trial 2), on intake of organic matter (IOM) from sorghum stover, and total intake of digestible organic matter (IDOM). In both trials, 36 rams were allocated to 36 different treatments: six levels of feeding sorghum stover (25, 40, 60, 90, 120 and 160 g organic matter (OM) kg- 0. 75 per day) combined with six levels of supplementation (0, 5, 12. 5, 20, 40, and 60 g OM kg- 0. 75 per day). Each diet was offered for a 21 day period; intake and digestibility were recorded during the last 9 days. Non-linear regression models were {{used to describe the}} combined effects of varying amounts of stover (x) and supplements (s) offered. All animals ate the full amount of supplement offered, but not the sorghum stover. For animals without supplement, maximum intake (m) of stover (i. e. IOM at high levels of x) was estimated at 50. 7 g kg- 0. 75 per day in Trial 1 and 45. 7 g kg- 0. 75 per day in Trial 2. In both trials, m decreased linearly with s at the rate 0. 4 g g- 1. Also, the shape of the curve relating intake of stover to x was affected by level of supplementation. Digestibility of whole stover (0. 47 in Trial 1; 0. 40 in Trial 2) was much lower than that of cowpea <b>haulms</b> (0. 70) and groundnut <b>haulms</b> (0. 62), but in both trials animals selected material of higher digestibility when excess stover was offered. Thus, the negative effect of supplementation on intake of stover was partly compensated by higher digestibility of consumed stover. For rations without cowpea in Trial 1, the maintenance level of IDOM was reached by offering 61 g sorghum OM (kg- 0. 75 per day) of which 47 g was consumed. With the same amount of offered sorghum 9, 18, 28, 38 and 48 g cowpea OM were needed to attain intake levels equivalent to 1. 2, 1. 4, 1. 6, 1. 8 and 2. 0 times maintenance, respectively. In the trial with groundnut, maintenance was not reached with sorghum alone and larger amounts of supplement were required for the levels of intake mentioned above. Iso-production curves describing which amounts of stover and supplement gave the same IDOM, were not linear with constant slope corresponding to the comparative digestibility of whole stover and supplements, but strongly curved. Such curves can be used to derive optimum combinations of stover and higher quality feeds, depending on feed prices, desired production level and taking into account the effects of selective consumption. With prices of cowpea and groundnut <b>haulms</b> 4 times higher than that of stover, the results of Trial 1 indicate that least cost rations for feeding at 1. 2 M (maintenance) would consist of 72 g sorghum OM (kg- 0. 75 per day) combined with 7 g cowpea <b>haulms.</b> For feeding at 1. 6 M this would be 70 26 g, and at 2 M, 54 50 g.

Significant (P < 0. 05) genotypic dependent variations were observed in yields (kg/ha) of grains (537 – 1082) and haulms (1173 – 3368), though significant (P < 0. 05) effects of location and year were observed. Grain and fodder yield {{had a tendency to}} be positively correlated (r = 0. 26, P = 0. 07). Haulms were analyzed for nitrogen (N), fiber fractions, in vitro digestibility, and metabolizable energy content. Highly significant variations were observed in all genotypic and livestock nutrition traits, although location and year had significant effects. Trade-offs between grain yield and <b>haulm</b> fodder quality traits were largely absent and <b>haulm</b> acid detergent lignin and grain yield were even inversely correlated (r = - 0. 28, P = 0. 05), that is high grain yielders had decreased <b>haulm</b> lignin. However, <b>haulm</b> N and grain yield also tended to be negatively associated (r = - 0. 26, P = 0. 07). <b>Haulm</b> fodder quality traits and <b>haulm</b> yield were mostly positively correlated (P < 0. 05). Broad sense heritabilities for grain and fodder yield were 0. 50 and 0. 29, respectively, while heritability for <b>haulm</b> fodder quality traits ranged from 0. 61 to 0. 67, providing opportunities for concomitant increase in grain yield and <b>haulm</b> fodder quality traits. Selection of the 10 highest ranking genotypes for grain yield, <b>haulm</b> yield, <b>haulm</b> N, and <b>haulm</b> in vitro organic matter digestibility showed selection groups overlapping, suggesting that multi-trait selection is feasible. Economical evaluation showed that choice of primary traits is context specific, highlighting the need for identifying and targeting appropriate genotypes to fit different production systems. Considering <b>haulm</b> quantity and quality as traits of economic value can increase overall plant value in mixed crop-livestock systems. Peer Revie...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the haulms from 860 breeding lines and cultivars of groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) considering three prerequisites: (1) livestock-nutritionally important genotypic variation in <b>haulm</b> value (quantity and quality); (2) laboratory infrastructure that can predict fodder quality in {{a large number of}} plant entries; and (3) no serious trade-off between pod and <b>haulm</b> traits. Haulms were analysed by a combination of conventional laboratory techniques and Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). From 860 <b>haulm</b> samples, 180 representative samples were selected based on their NIRS spectra for conventional analyses of <b>haulm</b> nitrogen content by Kjeldahl method and <b>haulm</b> in vitro organic matter digestibility (OMD) and metabolizable energy content. Results showed that there was very good agreement between NIRS predicted and measured values. The R 2 for the relationships were well above 0. 90, which is considered excellent particularly for biological methods like determination of in vitro OMD and metabolizable energy content assessed on the basis of inoculation of substrate with rumen microorganism. Highly significant differences amongst genotypes were found for nitrogen content, in vitro OMD and metabolizable energy content of the haulms. It is encouraging to note that <b>haulm</b> fodder quality traits and pod and <b>haulm</b> yields were not inversely related. The relationships showed that high pod yield and superior <b>haulm</b> quality and quantity are compatible traits...|$|E

40|$|Two {{separate}} {{studies were}} conducted using mixtures of groundnut <b>haulms</b> and Gliricidia sepium in {{the proportions of}} 100 : 0, 90 : 10, 80 : 20 and 70 : 30 to study short term intake and degradability of the mixtures. In the first trial, short-term intake of the mixtures was evaluated {{for a period of}} 6 days using sheep while, in the second trial the mixtures were subjected to in sacco degradation for 48 hours using Ndama steers to determine dry matter degradability. The proximate analysis of the mixtures was also carried out. Crude protein and lignin concentrations in the mixtures increased with increasing level of Gliricidia sepium. Intake of the mixtures decline significantly (p Gliricidia sepium in the mixture increased, the highest intake (9. 70 g DM kg - 4 w 0. 75 h 1) was recorded for groundnut <b>haulms</b> alone, this was similar (p> 0. 05) to those containing 10 % Gliricidia sepium. Refusal rates of the mixtures also increased significantly (p Gliricidia sepium increased the mixtures. In sacco dry matter degradability (%) of the mixtures increased significantly (p Gliricidia sepium increased in the forage mixtures. There was no significant (p> 0. 05) differences in dry matter degradability between forage mixtures containing 0 and 10 % Gliricidia sepium...|$|R
