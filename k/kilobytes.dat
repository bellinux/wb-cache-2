5|$|In 1978, Lawrence {{purchased}} the Commodore PET 2001 {{and no longer}} needed the university's computer. He rewrote DND as Telengard within eight <b>kilobytes</b> of memory. Due {{to a lack of}} space, he designed the dungeon to be procedurally generated based on the player-character's position so the maps would not have to be stored in memory. Lack of memory was Lawrence's primary design obstacle. Nevertheless, the final version almost completely used 32 <b>kilobytes</b> of memory. It was easily ported to the Apple II+ and TRS-80 platforms due to their similar usage of the 8K BASIC programming language. The later Atari 800 port required a more complicated handling of string variables. The three ports were finished before Avalon Hill saw the game at a gaming convention and licensed it in 1982 as one of its first computer games. The IBM PC port required a rewrite into the C programming language; the source code for this version was later lost. The Heath/Zenith CP/M version requires MBASIC. The game's most popular port was for the Commodore 64.|$|E
5|$|In a paper {{published}} in Nature in January 2013, {{scientists from the}} European Bioinformatics Institute and Agilent Technologies proposed a mechanism to use DNA's ability to code information {{as a means of}} digital data storage. The group was able to encode 739 <b>kilobytes</b> of data into DNA code, synthesize the actual DNA, then sequence the DNA and decode the information back to its original form, with a reported 100% accuracy. The encoded information consisted of text files and audio files. A prior experiment was {{published in}} August 2012. It was conducted by researchers at Harvard University, where the text of a 54,000-word book was encoded in DNA.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>kilobyte</b> is a {{multiple}} of the unit byte for digital information. The International System of Units (SI) defines the prefix kilo as 1000 (103); therefore one <b>kilobyte</b> is 1000 bytes. The unit symbol for the <b>kilobyte</b> is kB. In information technology, particularly in reference to main memory capacity, <b>kilobyte</b> is traditionally used to denote 1024 (210) bytes. This arises from the powers-of-two sizing common to such memory in digital circuitry. In this context, the symbols K and KB are often used when 1024 bytes is meant.|$|R

5|$|Adventure {{was named}} after Colossal Cave Adventure. Robinett began {{designing}} the graphics-based game, loosely based on the text game, on a Hewlett-Packard 1611A microprocessor computer around May to June 1978. Robinett was aware early on that memory use {{was going to be}} critical: Atari 2600 cartridges had room for only 4096 bytes (4 KB) on the cartridge ROM, and 128 bytes for program variables in the 2600's RAM; in contrast, Colossal Cave Adventure took hundreds of <b>kilobytes</b> of memory. The final game used nearly all of the available memory (including 5% of the cartridge storage for Robinett's Easter egg), with 15 unused bytes from the ROM capacity. Robinett credits Ken Thompson, his professor at University of California Berkeley, with teaching him the skills needed to use the limited memory efficiently. Thompson had required his students to learn the C programming language; Robinett carried techniques from that language into his programming of Adventure.|$|E
5|$|God of War: Betrayal was {{announced}} by Sony Online Entertainment {{at a press}} conference in Los Angeles in May 2007. The game utilizes a total of 110 different animations and features a 2D rendition of the series' three dimensional (3D) graphics. The character art and animation were done by WayForward Technologies. The only audio components are an orchestral score in the main menu and background sounds (e.g., clashing weapons). In August 2007, Phil Cohen, producer, designer, and game director for Betrayal, spoke of the difficulties in developing a God of War game for a mobile device. Cohen said that although enjoyable, the greatest challenge was creating a single tileset and palette swapping scheme that was diverse enough to portray multiple environments with only several hundred <b>kilobytes,</b> and that met series creator Santa Monica Studio's high standards. He wrote the initial design document between September and October 2005, and revisited it in August 2006, the month development started. The versions for high-end handsets were completed in April 2007, with final versions for low-end handsets completed by June 2007. The porting team adapted the game to over 200 handsets in a matter of weeks.|$|E
5|$|The main {{creative}} {{force behind}} the overall 3D presentation was Kazuyuki Hashimoto, the general supervisor for these sequences. Being experienced in the new technology the team had brought on board, he accepted the post at Square as the team aligned with his own creative spirit. One of the major events in development was when the real-time graphics were synchronized to computer-generated full motion video (FMV) cutscenes for some story sequences, notably an early sequence where a real-time model of Cloud jumps onto an FMV-rendered moving train. The backgrounds were created by overlaying two 2D graphic layers and changing the motion speed of each to simulate depth perception. While {{this was not a}} new technique, the increased power of the PlayStation enabled a more elaborate version of this effect. The biggest issue with the 3D graphics was the large memory storage gap between the development hardware and the console: while the early 3D tech demo had been developed on a machine with over 400 megabytes of total memory, the PlayStation only had two megabytes of system memory and 500 <b>kilobytes</b> for texture memory. The team needed {{to figure out how to}} shrink the amount of data while preserving the desired effects. This was aided with reluctant help from Sony, who had hoped to keep Square's direct involvement limited to a standard API package, but they eventually relented and allowed the team direct access to the hardware specifications.|$|E
50|$|In {{measuring}} bytes, 1024 {{is often}} used in place of 1000 as the quotients of the units byte, <b>kilobyte,</b> megabyte, etc. In 1999, the IEC coined the term kibibyte for multiples of 1024, with <b>kilobyte</b> being used for multiples of 1000.|$|R
50|$|When Microsoft {{introduced}} Microsoft Compressed HTML Help, {{the replacement}} to their classic Help file format, {{they chose to}} compress all of the HTML data with the LZX algorithm. However, {{in order to improve}} random access speed, the compressor was altered to reset itself after every 64 <b>kilobyte</b> interval and re-align to a 16-bit boundary after every 32 <b>kilobyte</b> interval. Thus, the HTMLHelp software could immediately seek to the nearest 64 <b>kilobyte</b> interval and start decoding from there, rather than decoding {{from the beginning of the}} compressed datastream at all times.|$|R
50|$|Lawsuits {{have been}} filed against various {{manufacturers}} including Western Digital, related to the claimed capacity of their drives. The drives are labelled using the convention of 10^3 (1000) bytes to the <b>kilobyte,</b> resulting in a perceived capacity shortfall when reported by most operating systems, which tend to use 2^10 (1024) bytes to the <b>kilobyte.</b>|$|R
25|$|Also in {{some cases}} {{third-party}} companies wrote special multi-function drivers that would combine the capabilities of several standard DOS drivers and TSRs into a single very compact program that used just a few <b>kilobytes</b> of memory. For example, the functions of mouse driver, CDROM driver, ANSI support, DOSKEY command recall, and disk caching would all be combined together in one program, consuming just 1 - 2 <b>kilobytes</b> of conventional memory for normal driver/interrupt access, and storing {{the rest of the}} multi-function program code in EMS or XMS memory.|$|E

25|$|Blowfish is a fast block cipher, {{except when}} {{changing}} keys.

25|$|An {{important}} force encouraging complexity {{was very}} limited main memories (on {{the order of}} <b>kilobytes).</b> It was therefore advantageous for the code density—the density of information held in computer programs—to be high, leading to features such as highly encoded, variable length instructions, doing data loading as well as calculation (as mentioned above). These issues were of higher priority than the ease of decoding such instructions.|$|E
25|$|CD-Text is an {{extension}} of the Red Book specification for audio CD that allows for storage of additional text information (e.g., album name, song name, artist) on a standards-compliant audio CD. The information is stored either in the lead-in area of the CD, where there is roughly five <b>kilobytes</b> of space available, or in the subcode channels R to W on the disc, which can store about 31 megabytes.|$|E
25|$|This {{standard}} supports standard memory cycles with {{lengths of}} 1 byte to 4 <b>kilobytes</b> of data, short memory cycles with lengths of 1, 2, or 4 bytes that have much less overhead compared to standard memory cycles, and I/O cycles with lengths of 1, 2, or 4 bytes of data which are low overhead as well. This significantly reduces overhead {{compared to the}} LPC bus, where all cycles except for the 128-byte firmware hub read cycle spends more than one-half {{of all of the}} bus's throughput and time in overhead. The standard memory cycle allows a length of anywhere from 1 byte to 4 <b>kilobytes</b> in order to allow its larger overhead to be amortised over a large transaction. eSPI slaves are allowed to initiate bus master versions of all of the memory cycles. Bus master I/O cycles, which were introduced by the LPC bus specification, and ISA-style DMA including the 32-bit variant introduced by the LPC bus specification, are not present in eSPI. Therefore, bus master memory cycles are the only allowed DMA in this standard.|$|E
5000|$|In December 1998, the IEC {{addressed}} such multiple usages {{and definitions}} by creating prefixes such as kibi, mebi, gibi, etc., to unambiguously denote powers of 1024.

25|$|Library code may {{be shared}} in memory by {{multiple}} processes {{as well as}} on disk. If virtual memory is used, processes would execute the same physical page of RAM that is mapped into the different address spaces of the processes. This has advantages.
