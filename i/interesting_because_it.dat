5|$|Some reviewers {{enjoyed the}} game's story, but many {{pointed out that}} the campaign's {{conclusion}} was anticlimatic due to its abrupt and unresolved ending. Plagge found the plot to be <b>interesting</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> explored different parts of the Halo universe. She also felt the integration of the narrative with the campaign missions was effectively implemented through the cutscenes and pre-fight dialogue. However, she remarked that characters were underdeveloped and the story did not contribute much to the main Halo arc. Stapleton thought that Isabel was an endearing and emotive character that bolstered the fear induced by the game's antagonist, Atriox. He enjoyed Atriox's strong introduction but felt that the character became less prominent as the story progressed. Eurogamer writer Chris Bratt believed there was potential for an interesting backstory with Atriox and the Banished, but he viewed their motives in the campaign as being too similar to the Covenant, which consequently made the story feel like it was retreading familiar territory. Reactions towards the campaign cutscenes were overwhelmingly positive, with plenty of praise directed towards the high quality production and exceptional animation. While the character dialogue was noted as being cheesy at times, the expressive facial animations kept the cinematics captivating.|$|E
25|$|The dating of the edifice is uncertain. The {{polygonal}} apse and the niches in the apse {{are typical}} of the churches of Palaiologan foundation. The building is architecturally <b>interesting</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> {{is an example of}} reproposition of the early Christian Basilica form during the later Byzantine period.|$|E
25|$|In a {{beginning}} film course at USC Cinema during 1969, Carpenter {{wrote and directed}} an 8-minute short film, Captain Voyeur. The film was rediscovered in the USC archives during 2011 and proved <b>interesting</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> revealed elements that would appear in his later film, Halloween (1978).|$|E

30|$|We didn’t {{know that}} we were doing science. It was science as in we went outside and looked for plants and all those types. It was the {{biological}} sciences in that time. But then {{as soon as we}} came into high school…that’s when it really opened my eyes to science, all the experiments. I just personally found <b>it</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>because</b> <b>it’s</b> more about the world and we can apply it to real life situations (05).|$|R

25|$|Although tilt {{and swing}} are {{normally}} used {{to maximize the}} part of the image that is within the DOF, they also can be used, in combination with a small f-number, to give selective focus to a plane that isn't perpendicular to the lens axis. With this technique, it is possible to have objects at greatly different distances from the camera in sharp focus and yet have a very shallow DOF. The effect can be <b>interesting</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> differs from what most viewers are accustomed to seeing.|$|E
25|$|The first Finnish {{statutory}} regulation for ships navigating in ice was given on 27 March 1890. It was primarily intended {{to increase the}} safety and set a number of requirements for passenger ships operating regularly in winter conditions. These included double bottom in way of the engines and boilers, construction {{according to the rules}} of Lloyd's Register or Bureau Veritas, at least five transverse watertight bulkheads, and sufficient damage stability to survive the flooding of two compartments without sinking. The last requirement is <b>interesting</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> {{was not included in the}} latter ice class rules and did not become mandatory again for ships partaking in international traffic until 1960.|$|E
25|$|A two part text, On the Binding of Contracts, {{deals with}} when {{contracts}} are binding {{and when they}} are not. The first section deals with general rules regarding when contracts are binding, including an analogy to the fact that Adam's trade of an apple for access to the Garden of Eden was valid even though it was an uneven contract because Adam knew it was such. The second half deals with cases in which a contract may be overturned. The tract is also <b>interesting</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is a collection of material from varying dates and places and as such much more uneven in content than other tracts.|$|E
50|$|This {{appears to}} be the first uninteresting number, which of course makes it an {{especially}} <b>interesting</b> number, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is the smallest number to have the property of being uninteresting.|$|R
50|$|A distance-transitive graph is <b>interesting</b> partly <b>because</b> <b>it</b> {{has a large}} {{automorphism}} group. Some interesting finite {{groups are}} the automorphism groups of distance-transitive graphs, especially of those whose diameter is 2.|$|R
2500|$|Incidentally, this {{relation}} is <b>interesting</b> also <b>because</b> <b>it</b> actually exhibits [...] as a Dirichlet series (of [...] ) {{which is}} convergent (albeit non-absolutely) {{in the larger}} half-plane [...] (not just [...] ), up to an elementary factor.|$|R
25|$|Shock waves {{can also}} occur in rapid flows of dense {{granular}} materials down inclined channels or slopes. Strong shocks in rapid dense granular flows {{can be studied}} theoretically and analyzed to compare with experimental data. Consider a configuration in which the rapidly moving material down the chute impinges on an obstruction wall erected perpendicular {{at the end of}} a long and steep channel. Impact leads to a sudden change in the flow regime from a fast moving supercritical thin layer to a stagnant thick heap. This flow configuration is particularly <b>interesting</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is analogous to some hydraulic and aerodynamic situations associated with flow regime changes from supercritical to subcritical flows.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1820s, the British Royal Mint {{produced}} several trial coins {{as part of}} experiments {{on the use of}} platinum in coins. One of these coins has the same diameter as a farthing and a weak relief owing to the high hardness of platinum. The 1812 Pattern 9 Pence Bank Token (S3773A) was used for the obverse and the farthing of 1825 for the reverse parts of this coin. No dies were manufactured for these experiments, so expired dies of the corresponding coins were used instead. Coins minted using dies from two different coins are called mules. The coin bears the year of 1825, but was likely printed at a later date. Like all test coins, the platinum farthing has a high historic and numismatic value. This coin is also <b>interesting</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> features the portrait of the already deceased monarch George III (1738–1820).|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, despite Metzinger's conceptualism of Cubist painting—the {{reflexive}} {{function of}} complex geometry, juxtaposed multiple perspectives, planar fragmentation suggesting motion and rhythmic play with various symmetry types—there does manifest itself in Danseuse a certain spatial depth or perspective {{reminiscent of the}} optical illusion of space of the Renaissance; in the way, for example, the wall-mounted lighting fixtures become smaller with distance, and so too {{the man at the}} upper left appearing smaller in the background than his counterparts in the foreground. <b>Interesting</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> shows that non-Euclidean geometry does not imply the absolute destruction of classical perspective, or that simply, the breakdown of classical perspective need not be complete. Unlike the flattening of space associated with the Cubist paintings of others, Metzinger had no intention of abolishing depth of field. Of course here perspectival space is only alluded to by changes of scale, not by co-ordinated linear convergence, resulting in a complex space perfectly adapted to a stage-set. This feature is observed not only in Metzinger's Cubist paintings, but also in his Divisionist and proto-Cubist works between 1905 and 1909, as well as in his more figurative works of the 1920s (during the Return to order phase).|$|E
5000|$|Scott Weinberg of DVD Talk {{rated the}} film 2/5 stars and wrote, [...] "One of the sickest and freakiest movies ever {{to come from}} a nation {{well-known}} for its freaky and sick movies (Germany), Cannibal is shocking, outrageous, sickening ... and just a little bit <b>interesting</b> <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> based on actual events." [...] Joshua Siebalt of Dread Central rated it 2/5 stars and wrote, [...] "The only real selling point Cannibal has is its graphic depiction of cannibalism. There are some nasty, nasty moments throughout, but you have to get through a whole lot of nothing before you see them." ...|$|R
30|$|The {{recent data}} {{collection}} in Medellin (the {{data were collected}} in 2011 – 2012 by the Universidad Nacional de Colombia at Medellin—that {{is the focus of}} this paper—is an <b>interesting</b> case <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is a comprehensive effort to characterize a city’s freight activity patterns.|$|R
30|$|Part of {{behavioural}} disruptions {{resulting from}} chemical exposure may rely on direct neurotoxicity or parental transfer, but beyond this direct relationship, behaviour is an <b>interesting</b> endpoint <b>because</b> <b>it</b> {{may also be}} an integrative indicator of several other physiological issues, e.g. metabolism, sensory organs, morphology or molecular pathways alteration.|$|R
500|$|Darah dan Doa was {{directed}} by Usmar Ismail, a former soldier who had previously served as assistant director on Andjar Asmara's Gadis Desa (Village Maiden) and directed two films on his own, Tjitra (Image) and Harta Karun (Treasure; all 1949). Creative control for these works, {{all of which were}} produced for the Dutch-sponsored South Pacific Film Corporation (SPFC), was held by cameraman A.A. Denninghoff-Stelling; Ismail served more as a dialogue coach. When the Netherlands recognised Indonesia's independence following several months of conferences in 1949, Ismail and other SPFC staff discussed establishing their own studio, though steps were not taken to do so until the following year. For his first production, Ismail chose to adapt a short story by the poet Sitor Situmorang, which the latter man had brought to him; Ismail later wrote that he considered it <b>interesting</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> [...] "honestly told {{the story of a man}} without descending into cheap propaganda".|$|E
500|$|The first {{actor to}} be cast was Renee O'Connor as Dr. Jessica Ryan in December 2006; she filmed her first scenes in February 2007. O'Connor had visited her {{personal}} friend and Boogeymans producer Rob Tapert on the New Zealand set, {{where she had}} had a discussion with him about [...] "the differences of having a supernatural demon versus a real person that can come in and be a threat." [...] She concluded the former was scarier. On getting cast in the film and her approach to the character, she stated:I had a contract with Rob Tapert and I just emailed him and said that I really wanted to play this character. I think she would be <b>interesting</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> touches back on some of the things I've played as an actress, and that was it. [...] It was so tight in the dialogue, you just have to play with the relationships and find other things going on with the characters to make it seem like there's more depth to what's going on, that there's more of a history between them.|$|E
500|$|After Bradfield {{sent her}} a demo of the album track [...] "I Don't Need Anyone", Minogue was {{dissatisfied}} with the lyrical content and re-wrote the track herself. Despite this, Minogue found it [...] "difficult" [...] to write the song so Bradfield had taken pieces of the original demo lyrics and mixed them with other lyrics she had written to create the finishing product of [...] "I Don't Need Anyone". She found this method of writing [...] "intriguing" [...] and {{wanted to do it}} again, so she decided to do this with [...] "Some Kind of Bliss", writing it alongside Bradfield and Sean Moore. Minogue commented about this method, saying [...] "He took one half of one set [...] and took another half from another set of lyrics and merged them together, which I found <b>interesting</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was something I wouldn't have done because, in my mind they're two separate things." [...] She later commented that she felt it worked together. Lyrically, the song is about her being happy and said [...] "To me the song is about being able, not necessarily shut your eyes and feel that someone is there but they way where you are close to someone [...] the ability to feel like they're with you even if they are a million miles away." ...|$|E

500|$|Kristan Reed of Eurogamer {{said that}} [...] "God of War II sports {{one of the}} most satisfyingly honed game designs we've ever come across." [...] He said that it would not {{overwhelm}} players and that it motivates them to improve their skills. He said that the balance [...] "always feels spot-on," [...] and the [...] "learning curve is just right," [...] adding that the magic attacks are more useful than those in God of War. He also said that God of War IIs gameplay, like the original, [...] "finds a comfortable middle ground" [...] between hardcore and casual players. Alex Navarro of GameSpot praised the pace of the game and the puzzle designs, and said the [...] "scale of some of the levels is unbelievably massive." [...] He also said that the story is <b>interesting</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is more about what happens around Kratos, than what happens to him. Matt Leone of 1UP said that the strongest aspect [...] "is how it excels as both a story and an action game," [...] and it is the story that [...] "allows the game to feel like a true sequel." [...] Roper praised the scale of the levels, as well as the variety in environments, in comparison to the original installment, and said the art direction is [...] "once again absolutely outstanding." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} saw {{the season}} as [...] "two shows"; Wyman noted, [...] "It's on us to make the mythology over there just as compelling as the mythology here, so we will enjoy both of them. We have our characters going back and forth, there or here, but there's {{a whole set of}} nice characters that you'll become very interested in very quickly. It's <b>interesting</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> gives you that gearshift." [...] Wyman later added that parallel universe plot device [...] "really allowed us to explore the characters deeper via their doppelgängers, to illuminate characters we already know. It’s been a real gas for all of us involved in making the show." [...] Historical idiosyncrasies were inserted into the parallel universe, such as a still-living John F. Kennedy, the non-existence of the FBI, and the Back to the Future franchise starring Eric Stoltz rather than Michael J. Fox. The writers loved creating an entire new world, and asked themselves what life would have been like in its most mundane forms, such as within daily routines. Pinkner thought it allowed them to create and explore many [...] "what-if" [...] moments, such as if the September 11 attacks had occurred against the White House instead of the Twin Towers, or if the Statue of Liberty still possessed its shiny copper sheen. [...] "Entrada", the eighth episode, {{was the first of the}} season to divide its time between both universes.|$|E
2500|$|The game {{made its}} first public {{appearance}} in the October 1970 issue of Scientific American, in Martin Gardner's [...] "Mathematical Games" [...] column. From a theoretical point of view, it is <b>interesting</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> has {{the power of a}} universal Turing machine: that is, anything that can be computed algorithmically can be computed within Conway's Game of Life. Gardner wrote: ...|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{the perfect}} {{isotropic}} absorption properties of graphene, the generated solitons could {{be regarded as}} vector solitons.

2500|$|The same claim {{has been}} made for a version in the Vernon collection. The Vernon Mona Lisa is {{particularly}} <b>interesting</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was originally part of the collection at the Louvre. Another version, dating from c. 1616, was given in c. 1790 to Joshua Reynolds by the Duke of Leeds {{in exchange for a}} Reynolds self-portrait. Reynolds thought it to be the real painting and the French one a copy, which has now been disproved. It is, however, useful in that it was copied when the original's colors were far brighter than they are now, and so it gives some sense of the original's appearance 'as new'. It is in a private collection, but was [...] exhibited in 2006 at the Dulwich Picture Gallery.|$|E
2500|$|In a poem on Southey, Landor praised his friend, [...] "In Thalaba, Kehama and Roderick {{the most}} inventive Poet/ In lighter {{compositions}} the most diversified." [...] An anonymous {{review in the}} February 1811 Monthly Mirror claimed [...] "The plot is ... powerfully spirit-stirring, but not <b>interesting...</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is utterly impossible for the feelings to travel with the persons of a drama so constituted as the present... It seems Mr. Southey labours under a great disadvantage, through the choice of his machinery." [...] It continued, [...] "Having given this opinion, we are now free to confess that the poet's art is, in the terrific, prodigiously displayed throughout, {{and we have no}} doubt that if Mr. Southey's love of eccentricity had not overcome his better taste, he would have chosen such a machinery, and so conducted his story, as not only to have agitated the nerves, but to have come home to heart, and rested there. Being what it is, however, we pronounce it a splendid specimen of a daring poetical imagination, fed and supported by vast sources of knowledge and observation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Godard became {{interested}} in 3D because [...] "it is still an area {{where there are no}} rules" [...] and thought it was not <b>interesting</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> had not yet been explored to its full potential. Godard thinks that technology, like a movie camera, [...] "reveal something cultural", such as what it [...] "mean about the times it emerged from" [...] and also how it is limited by what it cannot do. Cinematic techniques such as CinemaScope, dolly shots, close-ups or high fidelity are thought of as innovative, but actually create limitations by setting standards and rules in technique. He compares his experiments with 3D to early films by Auguste and Louis Lumière and D. W. Griffith, who made films before there were [...] "rules" [...] about technique, stating [...] "when technique is at its very beginnings, just like a child it knows no rules." [...] His inspiration came from the invention of perspective in painting, when the viewer understands the existence of space outside the painting's edges. Godard wanted to explore the illusion of depth in a 3D image suggesting something [...] "beyond the frame." [...] Like the double exposure of a 3D image, the film contains two parallel narratives that repeat with two different couples. Godard was following Alfred Hitchcock's theory that [...] "when you want something to be understood, you say it at least twice." ...|$|E
