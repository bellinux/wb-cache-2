5|$|The micro {{format is}} the most durable {{from the point of}} view of {{designed}} insertion lifetime. The standard and mini connectors have a <b>design</b> <b>lifetime</b> of 1,500 insertion-removal cycles, the improved Mini-B connectors increased this to 5,000. The micro connectors were designed with frequent charging of portable devices in mind, so have a design life of 10,000 cycles and also place the flexible contacts, which wear out sooner, on the easily replaced cable, while the more durable rigid contacts are located in the receptacles. Likewise, the springy component of the retention mechanism, parts that provide required gripping force, were also moved into plugs on the cable side.|$|E
25|$|Outside of the reactor, the ACR-1000 has {{a number}} of design changes that are {{expected}} to dramatically lower capital and operational costs. Primary among these changes is the <b>design</b> <b>lifetime</b> of 60 years, which dramatically lowers the price of the electricity generated over the lifetime of the plant. The design also has an expected capacity factor of 90%. Higher pressure steam generators and turbines improve efficiency downstream of the reactor.|$|E
25|$|Typically the LCOE is {{calculated}} over the <b>design</b> <b>lifetime</b> of a plant, {{which is usually}} 20 to 40 years, and given in the units of currency per kilowatt-hour or megawatt-day, for example AUD/kWh or EUR/kWh or per megawatt-hour, for example AUD/MWh (as tabulated below). However, care should be taken in comparing different LCOE studies and {{the sources of the}} information as the LCOE for a given energy source is highly dependent on the assumptions, financing terms and technological deployment analyzed. In particular, assumption of capacity factor has significant impact on the calculation of LCOE. Thus, a key requirement for the analysis is a clear statement of the applicability of the analysis based on justified assumptions.|$|E

40|$|Thermal {{response}} of the multiplier of an accelerator driven system to beam trips has been calculated for sodium cooled and lead-bismuth cooled multipliers. The temperature transients caused by a beam trip lead to thermal fatigue in structural components, and restoring the beam causes an additional temperature transient that adds to thermal fatigue. <b>Design</b> <b>lifetimes</b> for various multiplier components are calculated, based on the frequency of beam interruptions and on the thermal fatigue per interruption.
