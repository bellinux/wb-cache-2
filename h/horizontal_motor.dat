By comparison to Balb/c controls, Reln-rl-orl mutants did not alternate spontaneously in a T-maze and were deficient for visuomotor guidance in a water maze. Despite cerebellar ataxia and motor coordination impairments on stationary beam, coat-hanger, and rotorod tests, the <b>horizontal</b> <b>motor</b> activity of Reln-rl-orl mutants was not reduced in an open-field. The elevated cytochrome oxidase (CO) activity in Purkinje cells and the reduced CO activity in the roof nuclei (interpositus and dentate) of the mutants were associated with poor performance on the small stationary beam. In addition, deficient CO activity of the granular layer of the motor cortex was associated with shorter latencies before falling from the larger stationary beam and a lower number of rears in the open-field. Conversely, elevated CO activity in the polymorphic layer of primary somatosensory cortex was congruent with higher latencies before falling from the same apparatus, indicating functional compensation...|$|E

Material of the research: 60 adult male rats of Wistar line, weighing 200 - 220 g, divided into 2 groups - control and experimental. Myocardial dysfunction was modeled by intraperitoneal injection of doxorubicin by 5 mg/kg of animal weight. To verify the model of myocardial dysfunction ECG and histological examination of the myocardium were performed. Evaluation of higher divisions of the CNS reactions was performed using the "open field" method by such indicators: vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>motor</b> activity (decreased by 71, 4 %), acts and defecation boluses (down by 85 - 88 %), the number of burrows (decreased by 57 - 90 %), grooming (decreased by 23 %), all parameters were reliable (in p< 0, 05).

40|$|Abstract Recently, {{alterations}} in cerebellar nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB) expression and nitric oxide (NO) generation were documented {{to be associated}} with increased locomotor activ-ity in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). We aimed to analyze whether changes in cerebellar NF-κB pathway in hypertension associated with metabolic syndrome (MS) may affect locomotor activity of MS rats. Furthermore, the age-dependent changes were inves-tigated as well. Male Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY, 9 weeks old), spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR, 9 weeks old), and rats with MS aged 9 and 12 weeks were analyzed. Blood pressure was measure by tail-cuff plethysmography. Locomotor activity was tested by the open field method. Protein expression of NF-κB (p 65 subunit), inducible NOS (iNOS) and NOS activity were determined in the cerebellum. In SHR, despite no changes in NOS activity, increased NF-κB (p 65) expression was associ-ated with increased of both horizontal and vertical motor activities. Similarly, in young MS rats, increased NF-κB (p 65) expression led to increased <b>horizontal</b> <b>motor</b> activity despite decreased NOS activity.

It will have a fixed vertical axis and an adjustable <b>horizontal</b> <b>motor</b> controlled axis. This setup is similar to an office swivel chair. The tracker will actively track the sun and change its position accordingly to maximize the energy output. To prevent wasting power by running the motor continuously, the tracker will correct it 2 ̆ 7 s position after 2 to 3 degrees of misalignment. The sensors will compare the light intensities of each side and move the panels until the tracker detects equal light on both sides. Additionally, it will prevent rapid changes in direction that might be caused by reflections, such as cars passing by. A rear sensor circuit is also incorporated to aid in repositioning the solar panels for the next sunrise. The gear motor will have overturn triggers to prevent the panel from rotating 360 ° and entangling wires. The motor control and sensing circuitry will run on batteries charged by the solar panel.

40|$|The parabrachial complex {{has been}} related to the {{processing}} of both rewarding and aversive signals. This pontine area is activated after the gastrointestinal administration of rewarding nutrients, in taste aversion learning, {{and in response to}} the reinforcing and aversive effects of some drugs of abuse. Electrical stimulation of this region can induce, in different animals, preference or aversion behaviors towards a place in a rectangular three‑chamber maze task. This study examined the effect of tiapride, a D 2 /D 3 receptor antagonist, on the aversive or rewarding effects induced by electrical stimulation of the external lateral parabrachial subnucleus (NLPBe). As previously observed, administration of tiapride interrupted the aversive effect induced by NLPBe electrical stimulation. However, in contrast to the effects of dopamine antagonists on other rewarding systems, tiapride did not impair the place preference induced by NLPBe stimulation, an activation effect that is subject to tolerance. Tiapride administration also appeared to have no effect on the <b>horizontal</b> <b>motor</b> activity (crossings) of the electrically stimulated animals.

40|$|The initial {{pharmaceutical}} {{interest for}} the endocannabinoid system as a target for antiobesity therapies has been restricted by the severe adverse effects of the CB 1 antagonist rimonabant. This study points at oleoylethanolamide (OEA), a monounsaturated analogue, and functional antagonist of anandamide, as a potential and safer antiobesity alternative to CB 1 antagonism. Mice treated with equal doses (5 or 10 [*]mg/kg, i. p.) of OEA or rimonabant were analyzed for the progressive expression of spontaneous behaviors (eating, grooming, rearing, locomotion, and resting) occurring during the development of satiety, according to the paradigm called behavioral satiety sequence (BSS). Both drugs reduced food (wet mash) intake to a similar extent. OEA treatment decreased eating activity within the first 30 [*]min and caused a temporary increase of resting time that was not accompanied by any decline of horizontal, vertical and total motor activity. Besides decreasing eating activity, rimonabant caused a marked increase of the time spent grooming and decreased <b>horizontal</b> <b>motor</b> activity, alterations that might be indicative of aversive nonmotivational effects on feeding.

It will emphasize on the development of tri-thruster ROV. This will be a new type of design where the ROV will have two motors mounted at the front. Its layout is very different from other conventional ROV which have two <b>horizontal</b> <b>motors</b> mounted at the rear. The development accentuate on mechanical approach. The ROV developed will have hydrodynamic features add to it. The prototype is modeled using SOLIDWORKSTM and the further analysis of the model was done using COSMOSFloWorksTM. The quantitative analyses done has determined limiting factor for the ROV as it is desired to be operational in both sea and fresh water for a limited depth. For the fabrication purpose, this project will proceed with PVC pipe as its main component for frame. In methodological section, objective of material selection was to reduce fabrication cost without reducing the performance. The type of onboard control method used simple circuit of double pole double throw (DPDT). Simple circuit were chosen as it is easier to troubleshot and provide more reliability in executing motion compare to complex coding. From COSMOS analysis, the hydrodynamic cover performs very well in decreasing the drag force of developed vehicle. Guided by preliminary result and initial specification, a handmade fabrication will be done to create a prototype to show how this innovative ROV behave underwater, how its drive system response, how the control is functioned and how the motions are perform. The real time testing then runs and the testing bed preferred were surrounding area and control environment. The result was than recorded in video and examination done base on the recorded motion. From real time analysis, the hydrodynamic cover effectively smoothen the prototype motion at underwater and within water surface. The fabricated model can submerge, resurface, move forward and reverse, rotate to left and right. The result of this development will be significantly improved the existing design of ROV and pioneering the future development of remotely operated vehicle for underwater exploration. The fabricated model has installed camera and the first to be equipped with oblique hydrodynamic cover and frontal thruster layout.

40|$|AbstractPrevious {{studies have}} shown that low amplitude/high {{frequency}} mechanical vibration applied to the human eye muscles results in the illusory movement of a luminous spot fixated in total darkness. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate whether a vibration-induced motor response also occurs in eye muscles, and to check whether the visual illusions actually result from the proprioceptors being activated by the vibration, or whether they are simply due to the retinal slip induced by the reflex eye movement. The effects of the vibratory stimuli on the inferior rectus (IR) and lateral rectus (LR) muscles were evaluated by recording subjects' eye position changes. When applied to the IR muscle, vibration effectively elicited an upward visual illusion accompanied by a small downward ocular rotation, whereas when applied to the LR muscle, it also induced horizontal visual illusion, which was less frequent and weaker than the vertical one, but no ocular rotation. We concluded that visual illusions of this kind cannot be attributable to the retinal motion of the image of the fixated point. The difference between the vertical and <b>horizontal</b> vibratory <b>motor</b> responses is discussed as regards the particular role that oculo-muscular proprioception may play in the vertical muscles...|$|R

40|$|Male Sprague Dawley rats {{implanted}} with bipolar {{stainless steel}} electrodes {{aimed at the}} medial forebrain bundle {{at the level of}} the hypothalamus were trained to self administer a rewarding current on a 20 : 10 DRP operant schedule. A procedure based on the psychophysical method of limits was used to determine the threshold of self administration for this stimulus. The effects of the B 2 -agonist albuterol (salbutamol) on threshold, rearing, and motor activity were examined prior to and after a 19 day period of daily administration of either desipramine 10 mg/kg, fluoxetine 10 mg/kg, or saline. Acute administration of albuterol 10 mg/kg caused a significant increase in thresholds and decrease in motor activity and rearing when compared to the three saline days prior to and post administration. Rats tested after 19 days of receiving desipramine daily or saline showed a similar increase in threshold when dosed with the albuterol 10 mg/kg while the group treated with fluoxetine 10 mg/kg daily did not. The albuterol caused a pronounced drop in motor activity and rearing regardless of prior chronic drug treatment. These results are consistent with a down regulation of B 2 -receptors by chronic administration of fluoxetine but not by desipramine or saline.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess {{exposure}} to pesticides for a longitudinal epidemiological study on adverse reproduction effects among greenhouse workers. Detailed information on pesticide use among greenhouse workers was obtained on a monthly basis through self-administered questionnaires and subsequent workplace surveys. Questionnaires were filled in for a whole year. Dermal exposure rankings were developed for each task using the observational method Dermal Exposure Assessment Method (DREAM). Exposure scores were calculated for each worker for each month during the year, taking into account frequency, duration and exposure intensity for each task. A total number of 116 different active ingredients were used in the population, whereas a mean number of 15 active ingredients were applied per greenhouse. DREAM observations provided insight into the exposure intensity of 12 application techniques and three mixing and loading activities. Relatively high DREAM scores were obtained for scattering, fogging, dusting, and mixing and loading of powders. Observations with DREAM indicated that application with a <b>horizontal</b> ground-boom, <b>motor</b> driven boom, and bulb shower resulted in low dermal exposure. Exposure scores showed substantial variation between workers and over the year. It can be concluded that exposure variation between- and within greenhouses is very large, both in terms of chemical composition and exposure intensity. This may be a significant contributor to the inconsistent results of studies evaluating health effects of pesticide exposure. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Alexander’s law (AL) {{states that}} the slow-phase {{velocity}} of spontaneous nystagmus of peripheral vestibular origin is dependent on horizontal gaze position, with greater velocity when gaze is directed in the fast-phase direction. AL {{is thought to be}} a compensatory reaction resulting from adaptive changes in the <b>horizontal</b> ocular <b>motor</b> neural integrator. Until now, only horizontal eye movements have been investigated with respect to AL. Because spontaneous nystagmus usually includes vertical and torsional components, we asked whether horizontal gaze changes would {{have an effect on the}} 3 D drift of spontaneous nystagmus and, thus, on the vertical/torsional neural integrator. We hypothesized that AL reduces all nystagmus components proportionally. Moreover, we questioned the classical theory of a single bilaterally organized horizontal integrator and searched for nonlinearities of AL implying a network of multiple integrators. Using dual scleral search coils, we measured AL in 17 patients with spontaneous nystagmus. Patients followed a pulsed laser dot at eye level jumping in 5 ° steps along the horizontal meridian between 25 ° right and left in otherwise complete darkness. AL was observed in 15 of 17 patients. Whereas individual patients typically showed a change of 3 D-drift direction at different horizontal eye positions, the average change in direction was not different from zero. The strength of AL (= rate of change of total velocity with gaze position) correlated with nystagmus slow-phase velocity (Spearman’s rho[*]=[*] 0. 5; p[*]<[*] 0. 05) and, on average, did not change the 3 D nystagmus drift direction. In general, eye velocity did not vary linearly with eye position. Rather, there was a stronger dependence of velocity on horizontal position when subjects looked in the slow-phase direction compared to the fast-phase direction. We conclude that the theory of a simple leak of a single horizontal neural integrator is not sufficient to explain all aspects of AL...|$|R
40|$|Non-motor symptoms, {{including}} psychiatric disorders, {{are increasingly}} {{recognized as a}} major challenge {{in the treatment of}} Parkinson’s disease (PD). These ailments, which often appear in the early stage of the disease, affect a large number of patients and are only partly resolved by conventional antiparkinsonian medications, such as L-DOPA. Here, we investigated non-motor symptoms of PD in a mouse model based on bilateral injection of the toxin 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) in the dorsal striatum. This model presented only subtle gait modifications, which did not affect <b>horizontal</b> <b>motor</b> activity in the open-field test. Bilateral 6 -OHDA lesion also impaired olfactory discrimination, in line with the anosmia typically observed in early stage parkinsonism. The effect of 6 -OHDA was then examined for mood-related dysfunctions. Lesioned mice showed increased immobility in the forced swim test and tail suspension test, two behavioral paradigms of depression. Moreover, the lesion exerted anxiogenic effects, as shown by reduced time spent in the open arms, in the elevated plus maze test, and by increased thigmotaxis in the open-field test. L-DOPA did not modify depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors, which were instead counteracted by the dopamine D 2 /D 3 receptor agonist, pramipexole. Reboxetine, a noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, was also able to prevent the depressive and anxiogenic effects produced by the lesion with 6 -OHDA. Interestingly, pre-treatment with desipramine prior to injection of 6 -OHDA, which is commonly used to preserve noradrenaline neurons, did not modify the effect of the lesion on depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors. Thus, in the present model, mood-related conditions are independent of the reduction of noradrenaline caused by 6 -OHDA. Based on these findings we propose that the anti-depressive and anxiolytic action of reboxetine is mediated by promoting dopamine transmission through blockade of dopamine uptake from residual noradrenergic terminals...|$|E

Purpose of the work : a comparative study of the effect of anticonvulsants on behavioral and emotional reactions and physical performance under the experimental conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Study was conducted on 30 white nonlinear rats weighing 180 - 220 g and 30 white nonlinear mice weighing 17 - 25 g, which were kept on a standard diet of the vivarium. Drugs: sodium valproate, at a dose of 80 mg / kg and carbamazepine - a dose of 125 mg / kg. All animals were randomly divided into 6 groups of 10 rats and mice. Determination of physical performance of mice was done in a "stretched wire" (or "muscle relaxation") test, in accordance with the methodology.

To correct these abnormalities and prevent their occurrence actoprotectors are used in hospitals. In previous studies [Stepanyuk G. I, 2012] we found that 5 -R-thio-tetrazol [1, 5 -c] quinasoline derivatives quite clearly improved physical performance of rats according to swimming test. In terms of actoprotective activity compound-leader КВ- 28 (sodium 2 -(tetrazol [1, 5 -с] quinazolin - 5 - ylthio) acetate) for certain predominated over reference compound bemityl. WORK OBJECTIVE. To describe the influence of course administration of sodium 2 -(tetrazol [1, 5 -с] quinazolin - 5 - ylthio) acetate in comparison with bemityl on the behavioral reactions of rats under 18 -day hypokinesia. RESEARCH MATERIALS AND METHODS. Chronic stress immobilization was modeled by keeping rats in small wooden cases for 16 hours / day for 18 days. Animals were divided into 4 groups of 6 animals in each: I - intact animals, II - rats stressed with hypokinesia without correction (control), III and IV - hypokinetic rats who one-time within 18 days take daily intraperitoneally КВ - 28 (1, 7 mg/kg) and bemityl (32 mg/kg) at doses equal to their ED 50 according to swimming test. Orientative-searching and emotional activity were assessed by neuroethological "open field" test [Buresh, 1991] on the 4 th, 12 th and 18 th day of experiment, that accordingly characterize the stage of anxiety, resistance and exhaustion of general adaptation syndrome [Stefanov, 2001]. To analyze the behavior the following neurophysiological indices were used: <b>horizontal</b> <b>motor</b> activity (number of the crossed squares), vertical activity (number of racks), number of examined holes and autonomic balance: number of washings (grooming) and defecation acts (number of boluses and urinations). Duration of observation was 3 min. RESULTS AND THEIR DISCUSSION. In {{the course of the}} experiment a negative correlation of orientative-exploratory activity and autonomic balance indices were revealed in rats of the control group, indicating the inhibition of searching activity and high level of animals’ anxiety {{as a result of the}} negative effect of stress factors on them. Daily administration of compound КВ- 28, as well as bemityl to rats with chronic hypokinesia contributed to the increased locomotor and searching activity and normalization of autonomic balance indices in animals compared with the control group. Received data can show indications of psycho-emotional stress reduction in animals that was most clearly evident on the 4 th and 12 th day of the experiment when administering КВ- 28 and on the 4 th day - when applying bemityl. Thus, the results of the study give reason to expect that antistress action is inherent to sodium 2 - (tetrazol [1, 5 -c] quinazolin- 5 -ylthio) acetate (1, 7 mg / kg / intraperitoneally) as well as to bemityl (32 mg / kg / intraperitoneally). CONCLUSIONS. Chronic stress immobilization causes reduction of motor activity and exploratory behavior of rats in the “open field” test. Course administration of sodium 2 -(tetrazol [1, 5 -с] quinazolin - 5 - ylthio) acetate (1, 7 mg / kg / intraperitoneally), as well as bemityl (32 mg / kg / intraperitoneally) to rats with chronic hypokinesia, contributes to the restoration of indices of emotional and behavioral reactions of animals in the given experimental conditions.

The motor tests included the test of spontaneous motor activity (Open field), strength properties (<b>horizontal</b> bar) and <b>motor</b> coordination (rotarod). Cross-sections were taken in 50 % of the left tibia biomechanical length and further processed for fluorescence confocal microscopy. We analyzed the biomechanical properties of cortical bone cross-sections (software ImageJ). There were nonsignificant differences in CSG parameters (TA, CA, Imax, Imin, J, Imax/Imin) between Lurcher and control mice. The results did not support our assumption about the effect of motor disorder on CSG properties. We did not demonstrate the effect of local factors on the bone biomechanical adaptation. The results of this thesis may be useful to find new testing possibilities of cortical bone in [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Develop a {{paradigm}} to map binocular perceptual visual distortions in adult amblyopes and visually normal controls, measure their stability over time, {{and determine the}} relationship between strength of binocular single vision and distortion magnitude. Methods: Perceptual visual distortions were measured in 24 strabismic, anisometropic, or microtropic amblyopes (interocular acuity difference ≥ 0. 200 logMAR or history of amblyopia treatment) and 10 controls (mean age 27. 13 ± 10. 20 years). The task was mouse-based target alignment on a stereoscopic liquid crystal display monitor, measured binocularly five times during viewing dichoptically through active shutter glasses, amblyopic eye viewing cross-hairs, fellow eye viewing single target dots (16 locations within central 5 °), and five times nondichoptically, with all stimuli visible to either eye. Measurements were repeated over time (1 week, 1 month) in eight amblyopic subjects, evaluating test–retest reliability. Measurements were also correlated against logMAR visual acuity, <b>horizontal</b> prism <b>motor</b> fusion range, Frisby/Preschool Randot stereoacuity, and heterophoria/heterotropia prism cover test measurement. Results: Sixty-seven percent (16 / 24) of amblyopes had significant perceptual visual distortions under dichoptic viewing conditions compared to nondichoptic viewing conditions and dichoptic control group performance. Distortions correlated with the strength of motor fusion (r = − 0. 417, P = 0. 043) and log stereoacuity (r = 0. 492, P = 0. 015), as well as near angle of heterotropic/heterophoric deviation (r = 0. 740, P < 0. 001), and, marginally, amblyopia depth (r = 0. 405, P = 0. 049). Global distortion index (GDI, mean displacement) remained, overall, consistent over time (median change in GDI between baseline and 1 week = − 0. 03 °, 1 month = − 0. 08 °; x-axis Z = 4. 4256, P < 0. 001; y-axis Z = 5. 0547, P < 0. 001). Conclusions: Perceptual visual distortions are stable over time and associated with poorer binocular function, greater amblyopia depth, and larger angles of ocular deviation. Assessment of distortions may be relevant for recent perceptual learning paradigms specifically targeting binocular vision...|$|R
40|$|Background: Intensive care {{resources}} {{for the management of}} severe diffuse brain injury patients (SDBI) are limited. Their optimal use is possible only if we can predict at admission which patients are unlikely to improve. Aims: To develop a simple and effective model to predict poor outcome in patients with SDBI in order to help guide initial therapy. Material and Methods: The prognostic factors and outcomes of 289 patients with severe diffuse brain injury (GCS 3 - 8) were analyzed retrospectively. The prognostic factors analyzed were age, mode of injury, GCS at admission, pupillary reaction, horizontal oculocephalic reflex, and CT scan findings. Outcome at 1 month was classified as unfavorabledeath or persistent vegetative state, or favorableimprovement with or without some disability. A stepwise linear logistic regression analysis was used to identify the most important predictors of poor outcome. A prediction model (NIMHANS model-NM) was developed using these factors. NM and several currently available outcome prediction models were prospectively applied in a separate group of 26 patients with severe diffuse brain injury managed with a different protocol. Results: The most important predictors of poor outcome were found to be the <b>horizontal</b> oculocephalic reflex, <b>motor</b> score of GCS, and midline shift on CT scan. NM was found to be more sensitive (75 &#x 0025;) and specific (67 &#x 0025;) than most other models in predicting unfavorable outcome. NM had high false pessimistic results (33 &#x 0025;). Conclusion: Prediction models cannot be used to guide initial therapy...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the trajectory planning {{problem for a}} task which requires positioning and orienting an object firmly grasped by two hands at a visually specified goal configuration in the <b>horizontal</b> plane. The <b>motor</b> task involves three degrees of freedom (two translational and one rotational), and the motions of the arms are constrained by the physical coupling through the held object. Experimentally measured trajectories of two arms in the coordinated positioning/orienting task are presented. The hypothesis that the rotational and translational components of motions are decoupled and independently planned is tested. Two explicit mathematical models {{to account for the}} kinematic features of the two-arm motions are formulated, and the predictions of the models are compared with the experimental data. Both models extend the minimum-jerk model to the two-arm coordinated motions case. The trajectories predicted by the models were found to be in qualitative agreement with the experimental data. However, neither model could account for the observed configuration deCorrespondence to: Ealan A. Henis, ealan@research. att. com pendence of the motions, nor for some of the properties of the measured velocity components of the motions. Our findings support the idea that the rotational and translational components of two-arm motions in the positioning /orienting task are independently planned in extrapersonal space, and are further combined in a hierarchical fashion to produce the observed motions. The tested models may serve as a basis for further investigations of issues pertinent to the generation of two-arm trajectories. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{relation}} to mechanisms involved in functional recovery of manual dexterity from cervical cord injury or from motor cortical injury, {{our goal was}} to determine whether the movements that characterize post-lesion functional recovery are comparable to original movement patterns or do monkeys adopt distinct strategies to compensate the deficits {{depending on the type of}} lesion? To this aim, data derived from earlier studies, using a skilled finger task (the modified Brinkman board from which pellets are retrieved from vertical or horizontal slots), in spinal cord and motor cortex injured monkeys were analyzed and compared. Twelve adult macaque monkeys were subjected to a hemi-section of the cervical cord (n[*]=[*] 6) or to a unilateral excitotoxic lesion of the hand representation in the primary motor cortex (n[*]=[*] 6). In addition, in each subgroup, one half of monkeys (n[*]=[*] 3) were treated for 30 [*]days with a function blocking antibody against the neurite growth inhibitory protein Nogo-A, while the other half (n[*]=[*] 3) represented control animals. The motor deficits, and the extent and time course of functional recovery were assessed. For some of the parameters investigated (wrist angle for horizontal slots and movement types distribution for vertical slots after cervical injury; movement types distribution for <b>horizontal</b> slots after <b>motor</b> cortex lesion), post-lesion restoration of the original movement patterns ("true" recovery) led to a quantitatively better functional recovery. In the motor cortex lesion groups, pharmacological reversible inactivation experiments showed that the peri-lesion territory of the primary motor cortex or re-arranged, spared domain of the lesion zone, played a major role in the functional recovery, together with the ipsilesional intact premotor cortex...|$|R
40|$|The acute motor effects {{elicited}} {{by drugs}} acting upon adenosine A(2 A) receptors, namely the highly selective agonist CGS 21680 or the antagonists SCH 58261 and ZM 241385, were investigated in mice. CGS 21680 dose-dependently (0. 1 - 2. 5 mg/kg i. p.) decreased <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>motor</b> activities. The depressant effect of CGS 21680 (0. 5 mg/kg i. p.) was maintained in mice pretreated by the adenosine receptor antagonist 8 -(p-sulfophenyl) -theophylline (10 - 30 mg/kg i. p.), which poorly penetrates the blood-brain barrier, but was completely lost in adenosine A(2 A) receptor knockout mice. Thus, the adenosine A(2 A) receptor is critically involved in motor activity. SCH 58261 (1 - 10 mg/kg i. p.) increased locomotion and rearing {{with a quick}} onset, but for a shorter period in mice habituated to the environment than in mice unfamiliar to it. ZM 241385 (7. 5 - 60 mg/kg i. p.) stimulated horizontal and vertical activities with a slow onset at the two highest tested doses, similarly in naive and in habituated mice. The increase in locomotion elicited by ZM 241385 (15 - 30 mg/kg i. p. and 10 - 20 nM i. c. v.) was retained in mice treated by CGS 21680 (0. 5 mg/kg i. p.) but that elicited by SCH 58261 (1 - 3 - 10 mg/kg i. p. and 10 - 20 nM i. c. v.) partially subsided. In conclusion, both 'striatal-like'/'SCH 58261 -sensitive' adenosine A(2 A) receptors and 'ZM 241385 -sensitive'/'atypical' CGS 21680 binding sites may mediate CGS 21680 -induced motor effects. Moreover, our results suggest that 'atypical' CGS 21680 binding sites could be adenosine A(2 A) receptors with a peculiar pharmacological profile.
