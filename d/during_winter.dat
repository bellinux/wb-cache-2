5|$|Population size {{is usually}} largest {{during the summer}} and declines <b>during</b> <b>winter,</b> {{although}} populations in Texas and Louisiana may be more seasonally stable. Animals also often lose weight <b>during</b> <b>winter.</b> Population size varies dramatically from year to year in southern Texas. In coastal Mississippi, storms probably do not cause the population to decline substantially, and in Texas, inundation of its habitat did not significantly influence population density. However, in Mississippi, flooding did cause a marked decline in rice rat abundance.|$|E
5|$|VR {{has given}} mixed {{statements}} about the fault-sensitivity of the train. Pentti Kuokkanen, project coordinator of VR Engineering downplayed the problems when questioned about the reliability of another Fiat Ferroviaria multiple unit, the Sm4, in 1999. According to him, the Pendolino had been VR's most reliable passenger train <b>during</b> <b>winter</b> 1998–1999. In 2006, VR's CEO Henri Kuitunen affirmed that the Pendolino was causing serious image problems to VR Group. In 2010, the company's head of traffic control Mauno Haapala stated that the Sm3 was not more fault-sensitive than their other trains. However <b>during</b> <b>winter</b> 2011, VR Group's head of service and production department Pertti Saarela gave a totally different answer, saying that Pendolinos {{are more prone to}} failures especially <b>during</b> <b>winter.</b> It is impossible to know if the train has more problems than VR's other rolling stock, as the company does not give out punctuality statistics for specific train types.|$|E

5|$|Avinor {{has also}} {{proposed}} lowering the terrain {{east of the}} airport. The terrain is actually flatter to the east, but because the runway was expanded in that direction, the extension cannot be used without removing all ground in the twelve-degree slope. Although it has no impact on smaller aircraft, the reduced runway length has a severe impact {{on the performance of}} Boeing 737 aircraft, which are used by both Norwegian and SAS. For instance, <b>during</b> <b>winter</b> a 180-seat 737-800 can only utilize 71 percent of its permitted take-off weight; this would hinder fully loaded aircraft flying further than Oslo. The impacts for 150-seat 737-700 aircraft are smaller, as they can reach Oslo <b>during</b> <b>winter</b> and Berlin during summer. The airport served 169,428 passengers in 1996 and 216,000 passengers in 2000.|$|E

CDOT expedited the planning process for the bridge and work began the next year. Construction of the segmental concrete box-girder replacement was complicated by the need to protect the wetlands below, a problem that was solved by building the bridge from the top down and taking measures to allow the concrete piers to be poured and dried <b>during</b> <b>winter.</b>|$|E

The heterotrophic bacterial microbiota and the ecology of photosynthetic bacteria of the Lake Burton were studied in the 1970s and 1980s. Some of the findings indicate that salinity levels increase from below the ice level towards the lake bottom resulting in dense waters and that the environmental conditions, presence of light in summer, darkness <b>during</b> <b>winter,</b> and oxic and anoxic water status of the lake waters dictated the growth of bacterial phototrophs.|$|E
