40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{evidence that}} the price of oil does not respond contemporaneously to shocks to the <b>US</b> <b>gasoline</b> market. We find no support for the hypothesis of feedback from the <b>US</b> <b>gasoline</b> market to the price of oil, justifying the identfi cation of impulse response functions by applying a Choleski decomposition (see, e. g., Kilian (2010)). Our results have implications for tests of asymmetric gasoline price responses and forecasting models of the price of crude oil...|$|R
50|$|In 2010, 70.5% of {{petroleum}} {{consumption in the}} U.S. was for transportation. Approximately 2/3 of transportation consumption was <b>gasoline.</b> Today, <b>U.S</b> is still dependent on oil as oil is an important player socially, economically and politically. U.S. demand of oil is increasing exponentially causing the U.S. to continue to rely on foreign countries.|$|R
5000|$|Bio-derived {{gasoline}} can {{be produced}} from DME via high-pressure catalytic condensation reaction. Bio-derived gasoline is chemically indistinguishable from petroleum-derived gasoline and thus can be blended into the <b>U.S.</b> <b>gasoline</b> pool.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{its status}} as a U.S. territory, and unlike American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico ceased selling <b>gasoline</b> by the <b>US</b> gallon in 1980.|$|R

40|$|We use the LSE-Hendry {{general to}} {{specific}} approach to analyse if <b>US</b> <b>gasoline</b> price adjustments are asymmetric with respect to changes in crude oil prices. Furthermore, we modify some weaknesses in the earlier works by Boreinstein, Cameron and Gilbert (1997) and Bachmeier and Griffin (2003) and shows that if the price adjustment equations are properly specified and estimated, alternative specifications and temporal aggregation of data do not affect the results. Monthly US data are used to show that alternative specifications give equally good results {{and there is no}} asymmetry in the <b>US</b> <b>gasoline</b> price adjustments.

50|$|In 2001, 44.3% of all <b>gasoline</b> in the <b>U.S.</b> {{was sold}} through jobbers. Approximately the same {{percentage}} was sold through integrated oil company owned and operated stores or franchise arrangements. The percentage of jobbers responsible for fuel sale in the USA in 2004 fell to 37.3%.|$|R
25|$|Gasoline {{contains}} about 46.7 MJ/kg (127 MJ/US gal, 35.3 kWh/US gal, 13.0 kWh/kg, 120,405 BTU/US gal), quoting the lower heating value. Gasoline blends differ, and therefore actual energy content {{varies according to}} the season and producer by up to 1.75% {{more or less than}} the average. On average, about 74 L of <b>gasoline</b> (19.5 <b>US</b> gal, 16.3 imp gal) are available from a barrel of crude oil (about 46% by volume), varying due to quality of crude and grade of gasoline. The remainder are products ranging from tar to naphtha.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} anticipated and unanticipated changes in oil prices and <b>gasoline</b> inventory on <b>US</b> <b>gasoline</b> prices. We estimate empirical responses to anticipated and unanticipated changes in oil prices and gasoline inventory and show that gasoline price adjustments are faster and stronger for anticipated changes in oil prices and inventory levels than for unanticipated changes. Furthermore, this difference is statistically significant. We use these findings to evaluate the cost of adjustment hypothesis suggested by Borenstein and Shephard (2002). We also find {{that there is an}} asymmetry in the effect of gasoline inventory on gasoline and oil prices. This finding complements a well-known result that positive and negative changes in oil prices have asymmetric effect on gasoline prices.

40|$|Oil prices, {{inventory}} levels, {{and utilization}} rates {{are influenced by}} changes that are transmitted horizontally and/or vertically through the energy supply chain. We define horizontal transmissions as changes that are generated by linkages among fuels at a similar stage of processing while vertical transmissions are changes that are generated by upstream/downstream linkages in the oil supply chain. Here, we investigate vertical and horizontal transmissions by estimating vector error correction models (VECMs) that represent relationships among {{the price of crude}} oil, US refinery utilization rates, US stocks of crude oil, US stocks of motor <b>gasoline,</b> the <b>US</b> price of motor <b>gasoline,</b> and the <b>US</b> price of a substitute fuel, natural gas. Causal relationships estimated from both weekly and quarterly observations indicate that the price of crude oil is an important gateway for disturbances to the oil supply chain. Impulse response functions indicate that disturbances to crude oil prices ripple down the oil supply chain and affect inventory behaviors, refinery utilization rates, and the price of motor gasoline, and are transmitted laterally to the natural gas market.

50|$|If {{alternative}} fuels are desired at any cost, then the U.S. could also make synthetic fuel from its coal reserves.

2500|$|The GTA was {{available}} in 2-door sedan or convertible versions, with a single powerplant: a 2.0L fuel-injected 4-cylinder engine. At 4900rpm with premium <b>U.S.</b> <b>gasoline,</b> this engine developed [...] Driving performance of the vehicle included a 10.2 second mark for 0 to 60 mph and a [...]89g-force cornering rating in road tests conducted by Car and Driver magazine.|$|R
25|$|Ethanol-blended fuel {{is widely}} used in Brazil, the United States, and Europe (see also Ethanol fuel by country). Most {{cars on the road}} today in the U.S. can run on blends of up to 10% ethanol, and ethanol {{represented}} 10% of the <b>U.S.</b> <b>gasoline</b> fuel supply derived from domestic sources in 2011. Furthermore, many cars today's are flexible-fuel vehicles able to use 100% ethanol fuel.|$|R
50|$|Considering the inertia and {{kinetic energy}} of fuel {{in a plastic}} tank being transported by a vehicle, {{environmental}} stress cracking is a definite potential. The flammability of fuel makes stress cracking a possible cause of catastrophic failure. Emergencies aside, HDPE plastic is suitable for short term storage of diesel and <b>gasoline.</b> In the <b>U.S.,</b> Underwriters Laboratories approved (UL 142) tanks would be a minimum design consideration.|$|R
50|$|World War II hit {{both the}} USA and the USSR in 1941 with {{opposite}} results for rail passengers. In the <b>US,</b> <b>gasoline</b> rationing {{resulted in a}} surge of rail passengers with {{almost a third of}} passenger traffic going by rail.The impact on the USSR was just the opposite. The invasion of Germany deep into the USSR along with German bombing of railroads, took its toll and greatly reduced passenger rail travel.|$|R
5000|$|Shoshone {{went into}} {{operation}} for MSTS as a civilian-manned ship. Her role was point‑to‑point delivery of fuel oil and <b>gasoline</b> to the <b>U.S.</b> armed forces {{at a variety}} of Atlantic and Pacific ports. She eventually was reclassified as a [...] "transport oiler", resulting her redesignation from [...] "T-AO-151" [...] (as an oiler) to [...] "T-AO-151T" [...] (as a transport oiler). By 1974 she was operating from United States Gulf Coast ports.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the onset}} of World War II the {{refinery}} saw major changes. Many employees left for service in the U.S. military and close to 400 women joined the refinery workforce. The refinery shifted production to high-octane fuel and other products to meet military needs. In 1943 a toluene plant was constructed to supply the key ingredient for TNT and later, {{at the request of}} the U.S. military, was converted to production of 100-octane <b>gasoline.</b> The <b>U.S.</b> Secretaries of War and Navy and the Petroleum Administrator commended the refinery for exceeding the production of aviation gasoline requested by the government. In 1945, the Richmond refinery won its fifth U.S. Army-Navy [...] "E" [...] award for its support of the military effort.|$|R
50|$|The Hawaii Gas Cap Law is a {{state law}} setting a price ceiling on {{wholesale}} gasoline prices, the maximum amount that may be charged for producing gasoline and delivering it to a service station. Under the law, the gas cap was set weekly by the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission (PUC) based on average spot prices for regular unleaded <b>gasoline</b> in three <b>U.S.</b> markets, New York Harbor, the Gulf Coast, and Los Angeles.|$|R
40|$|The {{ascension}} of {{fuel oil}} price,include <b>gasoline</b> made <b>us</b> {{looking for another}} fuel oil alternative,that could be replace gasoline and ofcourse with the lower price. One of the alternative is gasohol (gasoline-alcohol), which is gasoline mixed with ethanol about 5 - 20 volume percent. The ethanol was produced from cassava plant. The cassava fruit was fermentated using yeast in various time then distilled to get high purity ethanol. The highest purity ethanol which got from fermentation at 5 days mixed with gasoline at 5, 10, 15, 20 ratio volume percent. The result of the analysis showed {{that the quality of}} gasohol is better than gasoline, and the best quality is reached at ratio 20 : 80, ethanol to gasoline with Research Octane Number (RON) 96, 2.

2500|$|In the <b>U.S.</b> <b>gasoline</b> is {{described}} in terms of its [...] "pump octane", which is the mean of their [...] "RON" [...] (Research Octane Number) and [...] "MON" [...] (Motor Octane Number). Labels on gasoline pumps in the U.S. typically describe this as the [...] "(R+M)/2 Method". Some nations describe fuels according to the traditional RON or MON ratings, so octane ratings cannot always be compared with the equivalent U.S. rating by the [...] "(R+M)/2 method".|$|R
40|$|Ethanol {{has long}} been {{considered}} the “Fuel of the Future, ” but concerns about the sustainable production of gasoline {{in the next century}} suggest perhaps the future is now. US ethanol production exceeds 3 billion gallons per year and capacity is rising more than 10 % per year. Air pollution regulations and the banning of MTBE in several states have opened a market for fuel ethanol. Domestic production of ethanol may reduce dependence on imported oil and lower greenhouse gas emissions. Studies from the USDA and Cornell University, ignoring their differing system expansions, suggest ~ 5 % more energy is extracted from ethanol than is used to produce it. About 52 % of the energy input is from domestically produced coal. The impact of ethanol is limited {{by the size of the}} resource. Grain ethanol production consumes 10 % of US grown corn, but it replaces only 2. 6 % of <b>US</b> <b>gasoline</b> consumption. The maximum sustainable stover ethanol production of the US is estimated at 4 billion gallons per year. The use of many other lignocellulosic biomass fuel sources would be necessary to impact the <b>US</b> <b>gasoline</b> demand of over 134 billion gallon per year...|$|R

50|$|On April 19, oil fell 3.8 {{percent with}} the news of an {{unexpected}} increase in <b>U.S.</b> <b>gasoline</b> supplies and the news that U.S. crude supplies fell less than they should have with production at its highest since August 2015. WTI still remained above $50 while Brent crude closed just under $53. On April 24, WTI fell below $50 and Brent crude closed at $51.60 due to doubts about OPEC extending production cuts and a statement by Russia that it would increase production.|$|R
2500|$|Blends of E10 or less {{are used}} in more than 20 {{countries}} around the world, led by the United States, where ethanol represented 10% of the <b>U.S.</b> <b>gasoline</b> fuel supply in 2011. [...] Blends from E20 to E25 {{have been used in}} Brazil since the late 1970s. E85 is commonly used in the U.S. and Europe for flexible-fuel vehicles. Hydrous ethanol or E100 is used in Brazilian neat ethanol vehicles and flex-fuel light vehicles and hydrous E15 called hE15 for modern petrol cars in the Netherlands.|$|R
