50|$|Stealth banning (also called shadow banning, <b>ghost</b> <b>banning</b> or comment ghosting) is {{the act of}} {{blocking}} a user from {{an online}} community such that the user does not realize {{that they have been}} banned. By making a problem user's contributions invisible or less prominent to other members of the service, the hope is that in the absence of reactions to their comments, the problematic user will become bored or frustrated and leave the site. If the user never becomes aware that they were banned, it will not occur to them to attempt to circumvent that ban.|$|E
30|$|To call Washday a ‘national treasure’ {{works at}} a number of levels: firstly, it applies to Ans Westra herself, a {{photographer}} of international importance, who has given us so many memorable images of Māori people, though few if any that clearly surpass the “sheer artistic excellence” of the Washday photographs (Westra 1964, Publisher’s Note, p. 2). The banned book itself deserves acclaim as a ‘national treasure’ for the sheer deliciousness of its story, all the copies rounded up and posted back to Wellington, there to be guillotined - let alone the fact that the kēhua (<b>ghost)</b> <b>banned</b> first edition sells online for hundreds of dollars, and to own a copy feels like owning a treasure.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with the reform and preservation of traditional drama, particularly those with supernatural subjects, in the People's Republic of China, largely as seen through intellectual debates of the 1950 s and 1960 s. I argue that between 1949 and 1963, the maintenance and reform of traditional opera was {{a key part of the}} Chinese Communist Party's policies toward cultural production. In contrast to narratives that characterize the socialist period primarily as one of cultural destruction, I assert that classical culture, as viewed through discussions on traditional opera, was treasured, promoted and protected by senior intellectuals. The first chapter follows the early efforts aimed at regulating traditional drama between 1949 and 1952. Specifically, it considers the decision of the Ministry of Culture to ban twenty-six plays and the impact the bans had on traditional repertoire and performances. Chapter two considers the fallout that stemmed from the early bans, as well as Ma Jianling's "ghostless ghost play" and the horrified reactions of intellectuals to his adaptation. The negative reaction of intellectuals forces us to reconsider preconceived notions of how Marxist intellectuals treated traditional culture. Chapter three places the production and reception of Meng Chao's Li Huiniang at its center. The play has generally been understood in the context of the Great Leap Forward; I argue we need to see it in the broader context of debates over ghost opera throughout the socialist period. Chapter four looks at the last open debate on ghost opera in 1963, the year that also saw <b>ghosts</b> <b>banned</b> from Chinese stages entirely. I argue that ghost opera is a barometer for the increasing radicalization of society, but that despite the leftward turn of politics, many people were not necessarily willing participants in the changes that were to sweep the country. Chapter five considers the role of ghost opera and traditional drama in the Cultural Revolution. I discuss two radical drama festivals and show that the cultural sphere was rather reticent to begin incorporating radical changes, until absolutely forced to in 1965. Finally, in the conclusion I briefly discuss the post- 1976 story of Meng Chao and Li Huiniang and trace connections to cultural production as it exists toda...|$|R
5000|$|In 1959 the Pine County Historical Society {{interested}} {{the state}} in acquiring the <b>Banning</b> <b>ghost</b> town as a historical site. Given the obvious scenic value of the area, the proposal quickly evolved into a call for a new state park. A bill to this effect was ratified in 1963, although the state didn't acquire enough land to begin developing recreational facilities until 1967. An undeveloped northern section was added in 1986. [...] In 1995 a dam at {{the southern tip of}} the park was removed, restoring a waterfall and another series of rapids. [...] Ironically the remains of the town, which prompted the creation of the park, are no longer even visible.|$|R
