25|$|On 19 October 2011, an HAL Dhruv {{helicopter}} of Border Security Force {{departed from}} Birsa Munda Airport to Chaibasa, crashed into hills near Khunti, killing all occupants on board. Investigation report concluded that pilot became spatially disoriented while solving a technical snag and applied excessive inputs to the helicopter while {{returning to the}} airport which resulted in severe rotor damage, causing the crash. However independent experts cited a previously known design flaw in the HAL Dhruv which results in <b>helicopter</b> <b>control</b> saturation when turning hard left. After this accident HAL developed a control saturation warning system which will warn pilots before the occurrence of a control saturation situation.|$|E
25|$|The Aviation Systems Division conducts {{research}} and development in two primary areas: air traffic management, and high-fidelity flight simulation. For air traffic management, researchers are creating and testing concepts to allow {{for up to three}} times today's level of aircraft in the national airspace. Automation and its attendant safety consequences are key foundations of the concept development. Historically, the division has developed products that have been implemented for the flying public, such as the Traffic Management Advisor, which is being deployed nationwide. For high-fidelity flight simulation, the division operates the world's largest flight simulator (the Vertical Motion Simulator), a Level-D 747-400 simulator, and a panoramic air traffic control tower simulator. These simulators have been used for a variety of purposes including continued training for space shuttle pilots, development of future spacecraft handling qualities, <b>helicopter</b> <b>control</b> system testing, Joint Strike Fighter evaluations, and accident investigations. Personnel in the division have a variety of technical backgrounds, including guidance and control, flight mechanics, flight simulation, and computer science. Customers outside NASA have included the FAA, DOD, DHS, DOT, NTSB, Lockheed Martin, and Boeing.|$|E
2500|$|Ten ocean minesweepers (MSOs) were {{assigned}} to Task Force 78 to sweep deep-water approaches to North Vietnamese ports and inland waterways and to serve as <b>helicopter</b> <b>control</b> vessels.

[...] She was pumped full of polyurethane foam so that she would not sink if she struck a mine, was equipped with padding to protect her all-volunteer skeleton crew, and was modified so that her entire crew of six could remain topside during her minesweeping runs, ensuring that they would be blown overboard if she struck a mine rather be injured or killed by slamming into the overhead anywhere below decks.|$|E

50|$|For {{helicopters}} with contra-rotating rotors—also {{known as}} Coaxial mounted—one {{over the other}} on the same rotor shaft (Like a Kamov KA-50), <b>helicopter</b> <b>control</b> requires interaction between the two rotors. Howevererent rotor masts (Like a Boeing CH-47 Chinook) uses differential collective pitch to change the pitch attitude of the aircraft. To pitch nose down and accelerate forward, the pilot decreases collective pitch on the front rotor and increases collective pitch on the rear rotor proportionally. Conversely, the synchropter and transverse-mounted rotor counter rotating rotorcraft have two large horizontal rotor assemblies mounted side by side, (like a Bell/Boeing V-22 tilt rotor) helicopters use differential collective pitch to affect the roll of the aircraft. All of these configurations use differential cyclic pitch to control movement about the yaw axis, tilting the rotors in opposite directions to cause the aircraft to spin {{in the direction of the}} tilted rotors.|$|E
