2500|$|He {{had his own}} {{idiosyncratic}} vocabulary: Although an agnostic atheist, {{he spoke}} of [...] "The Book", a visualization of a book in which God had written down {{the best and most}} elegant proofs for mathematical theorems. Lecturing in 1985 he said, [...] "You don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> God, but you should believe in The Book." [...] He himself doubted the existence of God, whom he called the [...] "Supreme Fascist" [...] (SF). He accused SF of hiding his socks and Hungarian passports, and of keeping the most elegant mathematical proofs to Himself. When he saw a particularly beautiful mathematical proof he would exclaim, [...] "This one's from The Book!" [...] This later inspired a book titled Proofs from the Book.|$|E
2500|$|The declining {{importance}} of the theoretical foundation, in favour of pluralism and equivocalness, did draw large crowds of newcomers. It also diversified Reform {{to a degree that}} made it hard to formulate a clear definition of it. Early and [...] "Classical" [...] Reform were characterized by a move away from traditional forms of Judaism combined with a coherent theology; [...] "New Reform" [...] sought, to a certain level, the reincorporation of many formerly discarded elements within the framework established during the [...] "Classical" [...] stage, though this very doctrinal basis became increasingly obfuscated. Critics, like Rabbi Dana Evan Kaplan, warned that Reform became more of a Jewish activities club, a means to demonstrate some affinity to one's heritage in which even rabbinical students do not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> any specific theology or engage in any particular practice, rather than a defined belief system.|$|E

He may have been--we know, indeed, that he was--no more averse to doubleÂ­dealing than any other Cinquecentist; but he was probably as averse to being found out in a meanness and made to look contemptible as any double-dealer of our own times.

He assumes, for example, that there was no dry land, nor any terrestrial life, {{before the end of the}} Silurian epoch, simply because, up to the present time, no indications of fresh water, or terrestrial organisms, have been found in rocks of older date. And, in speculating upon the origin of a given group, he rarely goes further back than the [...] "Ante-period," [...] which precedes that in which the remains of animals belonging to that group are found. Thus, as fossil remains of the majority of the groups of Reptilia are first found in the Trias, they are assumed to have originated in the [...] "Antetriassic" [...] period, or between the Permian and Triassic epochs.|$|E
60|$|The man ate stolidly some mess {{which had}} been stewing in a sauce-pan against his coming; he stared at his plate; his wife looked at him two or three times, with little startled glances, and then quite silently began to cry. The builder was an uncouth little fellow with a rough, weather-beaten face and a long white scar on his forehead; he had large, stubbly hands. Presently he pushed aside his plate as if he must give up the effort to force himself to eat, and turned a fixed gaze out of the window. The room {{was at the top}} of the house, at the back, and one saw nothing but sullen clouds. The silence seemed heavy with despair. Philip felt that there was nothing to be said, he could only go; and as he walked away wearily, for he had been up most of the night, his heart was filled with rage against the cruelty of the world. He knew the {{hopelessness}} of the search for work and the desolation which is harder to bear than hunger. He was thankful not to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> God, for then such a condition of things would be intolerable; one could reconcile oneself to existence only because it was meaningless.|$|E
60|$|The English writers seem {{largely to}} suspect their publishers; but I believe that American authors, when not flown with {{flattering}} reviews, as largely trust theirs. Of {{course there are}} rogues in every walk of life. I will not say that I ever personally met them in the flowery paths of literature, but I have heard of other people meeting them there, just as I have heard of people seeing ghosts, and I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> both the rogues and the ghosts, without the witness of my own senses. I suppose, upon such grounds mainly, that there are wicked publishers, but, {{in the case of}} our books that do not sell, I am afraid that it is the graceless and inappreciative public which is far more to blame than the wickedest of the publishers. It is true that publishers will drive a hard bargain when they can, or when they must; but there is nothing to hinder an author from driving a hard bargain, too, when he can, or when he must; and it is to be said of the publisher that he is always more willing to abide by the bargain when it is made than the author is; perhaps because he has the best of it. But he has not always the best of it; I have known publishers too generous {{to take advantage of the}} innocence of authors; and I fancy that if publishers had to do with any race less diffident than authors, they would have won a repute for unselfishness that they do now now enjoy. It is certain that in the long period when we flew the black flag of piracy there were many among our corsairs on the high seas of literature who paid a fair price for the stranger craft they seized; still oftener they removed the cargo and released their capture with several weeks' provision; and although there was undoubtedly a good deal of actual throat-cutting and scuttling, still I feel sure that there was less of it than there would have been in any other line of business released to the unrestricted plunder of the neighbor. There was for a long time even a comity among these amiable buccaneers, who agreed not to interfere with each other, and so were enabled to pay over to their victims some portion of the profit from their stolen goods. Of all business men publishers are probably the most faithful and honorable, and are only surpassed in virtue when men of letters turn business men.|$|E

60|$|Concluding Remarks.--If the {{creature}} which I have considered as the male of Ibla Cumingii be really so, {{and the evidence}} formerly given seems to me amply conclusive, then the animal just described, from its close affinity in every point of structure with the former, assuredly is the male of Ibla quadrivalvis. But feeling strongly how improbable it is, that an additional or complemental male should be associated with an hermaphrodite, I will make a few remarks on the only possible hypothesis, if my view be rejected,--namely, that the two parasites considered by me to be exclusively males, are not so, but are independent hermaphrodite Cirripedes, the female organs and ova (which, if present, would have been nearly mature, judging from the presence of spermatozoa in both species) having been overlooked by me in every specimen: and again, that in the animal described as the female I. Cumingii, I have, though minutely dissecting several specimens, and finding far smaller parts, such as the organs of sense and nervous system, entirely overlooked all the conspicuous male organs, though when I came to I. quadrivalvis, and naturally expected to find it likewise exclusively female, a single glance showed me the great probosciformed penis, and by the simplest dissection the vesiculÃ¦ seminales and testes were exhibited. Such an oversight is scarcely credible; but even if assumed, we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> the extraordinary circumstance of the two parasites being species of an independent genus, not only the very next in alliance to the animals {{to which they are}} attached, but in certain most important points, namely, the organs of the mouth, actually deserving a place in the very same genus. Moreover, the two parasites differ from each other, not only in about the same slight degree, but in a corresponding manner, as do the two Iblas to which they are attached; thus the mouths of Ibla quadrivalvis and I. Cumingii are closely similar, (the difference being barely of specific value,) so are the mouths of the two parasites; but the parts are larger in the hermaphrodite I. quadrivalvis, than in I. Cumingii, so are they in the parasites. Again, the most conspicuous character in I. quadrivalvis, is the number of segments in the caudal appendages, far exceeding those in the other species of Ibla, as well as of every other pedunculated Cirripede, and the parasite of this species has articulated spinose appendages, far larger than the barely visible, non-articulated pair in I. Cumingii.|$|E
