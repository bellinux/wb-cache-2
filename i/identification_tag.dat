40|$|We present edittag, a python package {{containing}} several {{tools to}} facilitate the design of edit-metric-based sequence <b>identification</b> <b>tags,</b> check existing sets of sequence <b>identification</b> <b>tags</b> for conformance to the edit-metric, and apply sequence <b>identification</b> <b>tags</b> to primers and/or adapters. We use edittag to design several large sets of edit-metric sequence tags ranging from four to 10 nucleotides in length and edit distance three to nine. Finally, we test a set of fusion primers designed with the software developed here, demonstrating high levels of successful amplification. |$|R

25|$|In 1945, Léon Theremin {{invented a}} {{listening}} device for the Soviet Union which retransmitted incident radio waves {{with the added}} audio information. Sound waves vibrated a diaphragm which slightly altered {{the shape of the}} resonator, which modulated the reflected radio frequency. Even though this device was a covert listening device, rather than an <b>identification</b> <b>tag,</b> it {{is considered to be a}} predecessor of RFID because it was passive, being energized and activated by waves from an outside source.|$|E

In 2007, another team completed the excavation and recovered additional human remains, life support material and aircraft wreckage. On November 5, 2008, The Department of Defense POW/Missing Personnel Office (DPMO) announced that the remains of four U.S. servicemen, including Sanchez, were identified. The remains of the four men share a single casket along with a box engraved with their names which was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery.|$|E

25|$|Situs inversus {{is found}} in about 0.01% of the population, or about 1 person in 10,000. In the most common situation, situs inversus totalis, it {{involves}} complete transposition (right to left reversal) {{of all of the}} abdominal organs. The heart is not in its usual position in the left chest, but is on the right, a condition known as dextrocardia (literally, right-hearted). Because the relationship between the organs is not changed, most people with situs inversus have no medical symptoms or complications, although they should wear a medical <b>identification</b> <b>tag</b> to warn emergency medical staff that the patient's internal organs are reversed from normal so they can act accordingly, e.g. by listening for a heartbeat on the right rather than left side of the chest.|$|E
500|$|Cyrus invited Brett Ratner, {{director}} of the [...] "7 Things" [...] music video, to her home {{to tell him how}} much the song meant to her and what it was about. After proposing numerous ideas to each other, they decided to make the video [...] "simple with a white backdrop". Cyrus said that neither she nor Ratner wanted the video to be [...] "all about [...] " [...] because the song's message was universal; [...] "almost every girl in America could say they hate their ex or current boyfriend," [...] claimed Cyrus. As a result, the video features numerous adolescent girls including actresses Nicola Peltz, Liana Liberato, and Maiara Walsh. During the planning session, Cyrus showed Ratner a collection of personal items her ex had given her, such as photographs and his dirty socks, which she had stowed away beneath her bed. They decided to include some of these items as props in the music video. For example, the necklace Cyrus wears in the video was her ex-boyfriend's medical <b>identification</b> <b>tag,</b> which he received because of his diabetes mellitus.|$|E

It shared mechanisms to increase impulse buying and get people [...] "to buy more by playing on the herd instinct." [...] The basic idea is that people will buy more of products that are seen to be popular, and several feedback mechanisms to get product popularity information to consumers are mentioned, including smart card technology and the use of Radio Frequency <b>Identification</b> <b>Tag</b> technology. A [...] "swarm-moves" [...] model was introduced by a Florida Institute of Technology researcher, which is appealing to supermarkets because it can [...] "increase sales without the need to give people discounts." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{people with}} situs inversus totalis {{are unaware of}} their unusual anatomy until they seek medical {{attention}} for an unrelated condition, such as a rib fracture or a bout of appendicitis. The condition may also be discovered during the administration of certain medicines or during tests such as a Barium meal or enema. The reversal of the organs may then lead to some confusion, as many signs and symptoms {{will be on the}} atypical side. For example, if an individual with situs inversus develops appendicitis, they will present to the physician with lower left abdominal pain, since that is where their appendix lies. Thus, {{in the event of a}} medical problem, the knowledge that the individual has situs inversus can expedite diagnosis. People with this rare condition should inform their physicians before an examination, so the physician can redirect their search for heart sounds and other signs. [...] Wearing a medical <b>identification</b> <b>tag</b> can help inform health care providers in the event the person is unable to communicate.|$|E
