50|$|The {{parallel}} processing of these signals, however, is performed separately and optimized for both acoustic hearing (focusing on low-frequency hearing) and cochlear implant stimulation (focusing on high-frequency hearing).

40|$|The {{auditory}} {{system of}} adult listeners {{has been shown}} to accommodate to altered spectral cues to sound location which presumably provides the basis for recalibration to changes {{in the shape of the}} ear over a life time. Here we review the role of auditory and non-auditory inputs to the perception of sound location and consider a range of recent experiments looking at the role of non-auditory inputs in the process of accommodation to these altered spectral cues. A number of studies have used small <b>ear</b> <b>moulds</b> to modify the spectral cues that result in significant degradation in localization performance. Following chronic exposure (10 - 60 days) performance recovers to some extent and recent work has demonstrated that this occurs for both audio-visual and audio-only regions of space. This begs the questions as to the teacher signal for this remarkable functional plasticity in the adult nervous system. Following a brief review of influence of the motor state in auditory localisation, we consider the potential role of auditory-motor learning in the perceptual recalibration of the spectral cues. Several recent studies have considered how multi-modal and sensory-motor feedback might influence accommodation to altered spectral cues produced by <b>ear</b> <b>moulds</b> or through virtual auditory space stimulation using non-individualised spectral cues. The work with <b>ear</b> <b>moulds</b> demonstrates that a relatively short period of training involving sensory-motor feedback (5 – 10 days) significantly improved both the rate and extent of accommodation to altered spectral cues. This has significant implications not only for the mechanisms by which this complex sensory information is encoded to provide a spatial code but also for adaptive training to altered auditory inputs. The review concludes by considering the implications for rehabilitative training with hearing aids and cochlear prosthesis...|$|R

50|$|An earmold (ear mold British <b>ear</b> <b>mould</b> or earmould) is {{a device}} worn {{inserted}} into the ear for sound conduction or ear protection. Earmolds are anatomically shaped and can be produced in different sizes for general use or specially cast from particular ear forms. Some users specify how hard or soft they want their mould to be, an audiologist can also suggest this. As a conductor, it improves sound transmission to eardrums. This is an essential feature to diminish feedback paths in hearing aids and assure better intelligibility in noisy-environment communication. The main goal in wearing earmolds is to attain better user comfort and efficiency. Earmolds (and their tubes) often turn yellow and stiff with age, and thus need replacement on a regular basis. The job of making earmoulds is very time-consuming and skilful; each one is made individually.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{magnitude}} of hearing loss in Pakistan is enormous. One in twelve children of Pakistan suffers from {{some form of}} hearing impairment.

This predisposes the patients to significant complications during a process that is otherwise considered safe. We report the case of a child, where the process of making the mould for a hearing aid led to the perforation of the tympanic membrane and pouring of mould material into the middle ear, necessitating surgical intervention.

40|$|Aural canal {{temperature}} measurement using an <b>ear</b> <b>mould</b> integrated sensor (Tac) {{might be a}} method suited for continuous non-invasive core temperature estimation in operational settings. We studied the effect of ambient temperature, wind and high intensity exercise on Tac {{and its ability to}} predict esophageal (Tes) and rectal temperatures (Tre). Seven subjects performed a protocol of rest at 21, 10 and 30 °C, followed by exercise and recovery at 30 °C. The subjects performed the protocol twice: with and without face-wind from halfway through the 30 °C rest period. Extra auricle insulation was applied at one side. Ambient temperature changes affected Tac significantly, while Tes and Tre remained stable. Insulating the auricle reduced but did not abolish this effect. Wind had an immediate cooling effect on Tac independent of auricle insulation. During exercise and recovery in 30 °C, Tac provided acceptable group predictions of Tre in trials without wind (bias: - 0. 66 0. 21 °C covered, - 1. 20 0. 15 °C uncovered). Bias was considerably higher with wind, but variability was similar (- 1. 73 0. 11 °C covered, - 2. 49 0. 04 °C uncovered). Individual predictions of T es and Tre showed more variation, especially with wind. We conclude that Tac may be used for core temperature assessment of groups in warm and stable conditions. © 2011 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine...|$|E
40|$|Hypothesis: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the impact of cochlear implant electrode insertion on middle-ear low frequency function in humans. Background: Preservation of residual low frequency hearing with addition of electrical speech processing can improve the speech perception abilities and hearing in noise of cochlear implant users. Preservation of low frequency hearing requires an intact middle-ear conductive mechanism in addition to intact inner-ear mechanisms. Little is known about the effect of a cochlear implant electrode on middle-ear function. Methods: Stapes displacement was measured in seven patients undergoing cochlear implantation. Measurements were carried out intra-operatively before and after electrode insertion. Each patient acted as his or her own control. Sound was delivered into the external auditory canal via a speaker and calibrated via a probe microphone. The speaker and probe microphone were integrated into an individually custom-made <b>ear</b> <b>mould.</b> Ossicular displacement in response to a multisine stimulus at 80 dB SPL was measured at the incudostapedial joint via the posterior tympanotomy, using an operating microscope mounted laser Doppler vibrometry system. Results: Insertion of a cochlear implant electrode into the scala tympani had a variable effect on stapes displacement. In three patients, there was little change in stapes displacement following electrode insertion. In two patients, there was a significant increase, while in a further two there was a significant reduction in stapes displacement. This variability may reflect alteration of cochlear impedance, possibly due to differing loss of perilymph associated with the electrode insertion. Conclusion: Insertion of a cochlear implant electrode produces a change in stapes displacement at low frequencies, which may have an effect on residual low frequency hearing thresholds...|$|E
40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONThe {{creation}} of <b>ear</b> <b>moulds</b> for hearing aids {{is generally considered}} a safe and routine procedure for trained professionals. In the literature {{there are reports of}} otological complications caused by hearing aid mould impression material in the middle ear cavity but such complications are considered rare. PRESENTATION OF CASEWe present the case of a patient in whom impression material entered the middle ear through a perforation of the tympanic membrane during the process of making a hearing aid mould and review how this was managed. DISCUSSIONWe discuss how many aspects of the British Society of Audiology guidelines were not followed during this procedure and make recommendations as to how independent community practitioners need to be closely supervised with regular review to minimise the risks of such complications. CONCLUSIONOur report demonstrates how a serious otological complication from the {{creation of}} a hearing aid impression in a community based private hearing clinic was managed. The reporting of such complications is rare but the incidence is likely to be much higher than the literature would suggest. We recommend and advise how these adverse incidents may be minimised and managed through competency reviews and formal referral links from community centres to hospital otolaryngology/audiology departments...|$|R

40|$|DISTRIBUTION: One of {{the most}} {{prevalent}} moulds on harvested maize throughout the world. Diplodia ear rot {{is caused by the}} fungus Diplodia maydis. Maize is produced mainly in the North-West, the north-western, northern and eastern Free State, the Mpumalanga Highveld and the Kwazulu-Natal midlands. BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION: General: It is a phytopathogenic fungus that causes i. a. stalk rot and cob rot. Conspicuous coarse, white to grey mycelium, resembling toothpaste. The fungus overwinters as mycelium, spores, and picnidia on corn residue or seed. Primarily splashing rain spreads the spores. Infections first appear {{at the base of the}} ear. Corn borer damage in the shank can provide an entry wound for the pathogen. Diplodia is favoured by cool, wet weather during grain fill. This fungus initially appears as a white mould beginning at the base of the <b>ear.</b> The <b>mould</b> and the kernels eventually turn a greyish brown colour and rot the entire <b>ear.</b> The <b>mould</b> may be apparent on the outside of the husk or on the shank. A distinguishing characteristic of Diplodia ear rot is the appearance of raised black bumps on the moldy husk or kernels. These are the picnidia of the fungus, where new spores are produced. TOXIC PRINCIPLE: Unknown neurotoxin. SYNDROMES: Diplodiosis. SYSTEMS AFFECTED : Central nervous system. CLINICAL SIGNS: A neurotoxicosis of cattle and occasionally sheep on harvested maize fields in winter. In cattle • salivation, • wide-base stance, • tremors, • ataxia, • incoordination, • stiffness, • high-stepping gait and • paresis/paralysis are observed. NECROPSY: • Nothing specific. Colour photos.
