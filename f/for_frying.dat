5|$|Initially, Sanders and KFC used {{hydrogenated}} {{vegetable oil}} <b>for</b> <b>frying,</b> {{but in the}} 1980s the company began to switch to cheaper oils such as palm or soybean. In the 2000s {{it became apparent that}} these oils contain relatively high levels of trans fat, which increases the risk of heart disease. By April 2007, the chain had switched to trans fat-free soybean oil in all of its US outlets.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, lard {{is used to}} fry the chicken, but corn oil, peanut oil, canola oil, or {{vegetable}} oil are also frequently used (although clarified butter {{may be used as}} well like in colonial times). The flavor of olive oil is generally considered too strong to be used for traditional fried chicken, and its low smoke point makes it unsuitable for use. There are three main techniques <b>for</b> <b>frying</b> chickens: pan frying, deep frying and broasting.|$|E

5|$|Deep frying {{produces}} {{large amounts}} of waste oil, which must be disposed of properly. Waste oil can overflow sewage systems, bind to the walls of sewage pipes, and interfere with sewage treatment. Waste oil from deep frying is increasingly being recycled and refined into biodiesel. Potatoes that are stored in artificially humidified warehouses contain more water, which makes {{the time required to}} deep fry them into chips longer. This increases the carbon dioxide footprint of commercially producing chips because more energy is required <b>for</b> <b>frying</b> over a longer time. According to one source, an average home appliance deep fryer draws 2,000 watts.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the world, {{different}} seasoning {{and spices}} {{are used to}} augment the flavor of fried chicken. Because of the versatility of fried chicken, {{it is not uncommon}} to flavor the chicken's crisp exterior with a variety of spices ranging from spicy to savory. Depending on regional market ubiquity, local spice variations may be labeled as distinct from traditional Southern U.S. flavors, or may appear on menus without notation. With access to chickens suitable <b>for</b> <b>frying</b> broadening on a global scale with the advent of industrialized poultry farming, many localities have added their own mark on fried chicken, tweaking recipes to suit local preferences.|$|E

25|$|In July 2008, California {{became the}} first state to ban trans fats in {{restaurants}} effective 1 January 2010; Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed the bill into law. California restaurants are prohibited from using oil, shortening, and margarine containing artificial trans fats in spreads or <b>for</b> <b>frying,</b> with the exception of deep frying doughnuts. As of 1 January 2011, doughnuts and other baked goods have been prohibited from containing artificial trans fats. Packaged foods are not covered by the ban and can legally contain trans fats.|$|E
25|$|Sesame seeds {{were used}} in the {{preparation}} of oil, or were eaten dry, or were added to dishes such as stews as a flavoring; the leftovers after pressing out the oil were eaten in a cake form. The Hebrew for sesame, shumshum, is related to the Akkadian samassammu, meaning “oil plant”, as the seeds contain about 50% oil, which was pressed from the seeds. Sesame is not mentioned in the Bible, but the Mishna lists sesame oil as suitable for lighting the Sabbath lights, and the oil was also used <b>for</b> <b>frying.</b>|$|E

Rectangular griddles that cover two stove burners are now also common, as are griddles that have a ribbed area {{that can be used}} like a grill pan. Some have multiple square metal grooves enabling the contents to have a defined pattern, similar to a waffle maker. Like frypans, round griddles are generally measured by diameter (20–30cm).|$|E
25|$|In the Netherlands, a Dutch oven {{is called}} a , which {{literally}} translates to frying pan or roasting pan. An other name for it is sudderpan, which literally translates to 'simmerpan' or 'simmering pot'. The design most used today is a black (with blue inside) enameled steel pan, that is suitable for gas and induction heating. The model was introduced in 1891 by BK, a well known Dutch manufacturer of cookware. Cheaper and lighter in weight than cast iron, {{it proved to be}} a revolution in the kitchen. A braadpan is mainly used <b>for</b> <b>frying</b> meat only, {{but it can also be}} used for making traditional stews such as hachée. Cast-iron models exist, but are used less frequently.|$|E
500|$|Slippery jacks do {{not keep}} for long after picking, {{nor are they}} {{suitable}} for drying, as their water content is too high. They are suited <b>for</b> <b>frying,</b> or cooking in stews and soups, either alone or with other mushroom species. Puréeing the mushroom is not recommended, however: [...] "We once {{made the mistake of}} running it through a blender to make a soup. The result was a substance recommending itself for use when hanging wallpaper." [...] S.luteus and other Suillus species may cause allergic reactions in some people or digestive problems that appear to result from consuming the slimy skin. The fungus is better cooked before eating, and some authors recommend discarding the glutinous cuticle and tubes before cooking. Moreover, the skin can spoil other fungi with which slippery jacks are collected.|$|E

500|$|Acton's book {{is divided}} into {{chapters}} with brief, often single word titles such as [...] "Fish". In a marked departure from eighteenth century English cookery books like Hannah Glasse's The Art of Cookery, these are written as connected wholes. The chapter on fish begins with an essay on how to choose fish for freshness; there follows some {{advice on how to}} bake fish, and on the kinds of fat best used <b>for</b> <b>frying</b> fish. Suitable pans are illustrated. The recipes follow; these too are written as stories rather than simply as instructions. Where appropriate, recipes end with a list of ingredients, as well as the cooking time, in marked change from eighteenth century practice. Recipes are grouped, in the case of fish by species, and they form a connected story. Acton adds comments where she sees fit, indicating anything from when the food is in season to where a recipe came from, and how much she likes it. For example, she begins her account of the John Dory with a recipe which is more of an introductory essay than a set of instructions, though given the simplicity of the recipe, it says all that a cook would need to know on the matter: ...|$|E
500|$|To {{prepare the}} chicken pieces <b>for</b> <b>frying,</b> {{they may be}} coated in a batter of flour and liquid (and seasonings) mixed together. The batter can contain {{ingredients}} like eggs, milk, and leavening. Alternatively, they may be dredged in flour or a similar dry substance, to coat the meat {{and to develop a}} crust. Seasonings such as salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, or ranch dressing mix can be mixed in with the flour. Either process may be preceded by marination or by dipping in milk or buttermilk. As the pieces of chicken cook, some of the moisture that exudes from the chicken is absorbed by the coating of flour and browns along with the flour, creating a flavorful crust. According to Nathan Bailey's 1736 cookbook, Dictionarium Domesticum, for example, the chicken can be covered in a marinade that consists of the juice of two large fresh lemons, malt vinegar, bay leaves, salt, pepper, ground cloves, and green onions; it then must be settled in the marinade for three hours before being dipped in the batter that consists of all-purpose flour, white wine, three egg yolks and salt, and then slowly submerged in a deep pot of either oil, lard, or clarified butter over an open fire. [...] It can then be topped with fresh, dried parsley dipped in the same frying oil.|$|E

In sources from the Tang dynasty (618–907), chao refers not to a cooking technique, but to a method for roasting tea leaves. It reappears as a cooking method in a dozen recipes from the Song dynasty (960–1279). The Song period is when the Chinese started to use vegetable oil <b>for</b> <b>frying</b> instead of animal fats.
