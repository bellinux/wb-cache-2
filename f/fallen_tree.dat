5|$|A {{number of}} local street names were derived from the {{presence}} of St John's. Church Street, which ends directly opposite the church entrance, was originally the track used by Burwood residents to reach the church, using a conveniently located <b>fallen</b> <b>tree</b> across Iron Cove Creek.|$|E
5|$|In Southaven, 40homes were flooded and 200were left {{homeless}} as {{a result}} of the heavy rainfall. A church undergoing construction in Calhoun County was damaged, and a street light in Lee County was snapped. Also, a <b>fallen</b> <b>tree</b> damaged a house in Itawamba County. One indirect fatality occurred in Jasper County from an automobile accident due to wet roads. An estimated 24,000customers lost electric power during the storm. After the storm, several fires were sparked due to downed electrical wires. In all, the weakening Hurricane Dennis left $2.6million (2005USD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|It is {{reported}} that the worst damage occurred in Escambia and Monroe counties. In the Escambia County city of Atmore, 100 percent of the city's residents lost electric power for some {{a period of time}} during the hurricane. The strongest winds occurred in Escambia County, where gusts surpassed , leaving numerous structures damaged or destroyed as Dennis tracked through the western half of the county. One man in the county was injured by a <b>fallen</b> <b>tree</b> branch. Also, an unconfirmed tornado tore the roof off a home, forcing emergency workers to evacuate a man inside.|$|E
40|$|Since <b>fallen</b> <b>trees</b> are a {{key factor}} in {{biodiversity}} and biogeochemical cycling, information about their spatial distribution is of use in determining species distribution and nutrient and carbon cycling in forest ecosystems. Ground-based surveys are both time consuming and labour intensive. Remote-sensing technology can reduce these costs. Here, we used high-spatial-resolution aerial photographs (0. 5 - 1. 0 cm per pixel) taken from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to survey <b>fallen</b> <b>trees</b> in a deciduous broadleaved forest in eastern Japan. In nine sub-plots we found a total of 44 <b>fallen</b> <b>trees</b> by ground survey. From the aerial photographs, we identified 80 % to 90 % of <b>fallen</b> <b>trees</b> that were > 30 cm in diameter or > 10 m in length, but missed many that were narrower or shorter. This failure {{may be due to the}} similarity of <b>fallen</b> <b>trees</b> to trunks and branches of standing trees or masking by standing trees. Views of the same point from different angles may improve the detection rate because they would provide more opportunity to detect <b>fallen</b> <b>trees</b> hidden by standing trees. Our results suggest that UAV surveys will make it possible to monitor the spatial and temporal variations in forest structure and function at lower cost...|$|R

5|$|Other mammals can be destructive. Possums {{tend not}} to eat {{the leaves of the}} tree, but are very fond of eating the sugar-rich {{flowering}} stalks as they emerge. They also like using the tree as a sleeping place. Rabbits can be more destructive, especially during periods of drought, when they have been seen to eat through the base until a tree falls, and then eating the <b>fallen</b> <b>tree</b> completely. Horses can also fell a tree by eating through the trunk.|$|E
5|$|The {{restaurant}} {{is located on}} Broad Street {{in the town of}} Montgomery, Powys, a short distance from Montgomery Castle. There is a separate dining room and bar/lounge area in the restaurant. The dining room has low-slung beams, and an open brick fireplace, around which are placed Laura Ashley sofas. The chestnut wood flooring of the restaurant was created from a <b>fallen</b> <b>tree</b> on the Francis family farm. There is room to serve up to 40 diners, with 12 members of staff working there. There are three en-suite rooms available to hire on a hotel basis.|$|E
5|$|High surf also {{occurred}} {{along the southern}} coast of Massachusetts, prompting {{the closing of the}} ferry between Nantucket and Boston. Beryl produced a storm surge of 0.9feet (.27m) on Nantucket. Winds across southeastern Massachusetts were fairly light, with no sustained tropical storm force winds and wind gusts peaking at 44mph (71km/h); unofficially gusts reached 51mph (82km/h). Beryl dropped moderate precipitation just offshore, though the maximum precipitation total in the United States was only 0.97inches (24.6mm) on Nantucket. Rainfall along southeastern Massachusetts reached 0.33inches (8.38mm) at Chatham. The only reported damage were some downed telephone poles and <b>fallen</b> <b>tree</b> branches. Overall impact was minor; there were no reported power outages, deaths, injuries, or maritime emergencies in association with the storm.|$|E

5|$|In the Enchanted Forest, a guarded {{carriage}} carrying Prince Charming (Joshua Dallas) and his fiancee, Abigail (Anastasia Griffith), is halted by a roadblock. Charming {{notices a}} <b>fallen</b> <b>tree</b> is blocking the road, {{and that it}} was cut on purpose. The carriage is ambushed by a hooded vagabond, who takes Charming's bag of valuables, including a wedding ring. Charming pursues and knocks the mysterious thief off their horse. He discovers it is a woman, Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin). Before he can get an answer as to why she stole his bag, Snow hits him with a rock, surprising and cutting him to make her escape. Charming vows that he will find her.|$|E
5|$|Off Kyūshū, a Maldives-registered {{car ferry}} capsized, killing one crew member. A train was derailed, {{possibly}} {{due to a}} tornado, injuring five people. On the island, an electrician in Fukuoka Prefecture died after an industrial container at his firm fell on top of him, crushing him. A glass entrance of a supermarket in Nobeoka broke on impact with flying debris, killing one person. Elsewhere in the prefecture, a 42-year-old man died in his bedroom when it was crushed, while an elderly woman farmer {{died when she was}} hit by a <b>fallen</b> <b>tree</b> outside a greenhouse. Three other deaths were confirmed on the island.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{the timing}} of its dissipation, Emily spared {{neighboring}} Haiti from the devastation initially anticipated. At least 235 people in Jacmel and Tabarre, as well as 65 prisoners from Gonaïves and Miragoâne, required evacuation {{at the height of}} the storm. In Artibonite, civil protection teams evacuated roughly 300 residents. Rainfall triggered floods that damaged over 300 homes throughout the country, while several cholera treatment centers were destroyed. At the risk of new outbreaks, special sterilizers were distributed to sanitize possibly contaminated waters. A body was recovered from a ravine near Les Cayes, but the exact cause of death was disputed; another person in the area sustained injuries after being hit by a <b>fallen</b> <b>tree.</b> High winds caused some property damage in Léogâne and Jacmel.|$|E

5|$|Strong {{winds were}} also {{reported}} in New England. The highest winds associated with Daisy were felt over coastal Maine, where winds of 70mph (115km/h) were commonly reported. Wind damage was severe and widespread; {{one person in}} Maine was killed when a <b>fallen</b> <b>tree</b> landed on, and crushed his car {{while he was in}} it. In the southeastern portion of the state, power outages were reported, due to fallen trees and tree limbs. In addition, some roof shingles blown off in Maine and Massachusetts, while other houses were completely unroofed. Daisy caused moderate to severe damage in eastern New England. Total wind damage in New England was estimated to have reached $500,000.|$|E
5|$|The plank {{road was}} {{operational}} for about 38 years when a major flood on June 1, 1889 washed out much of it. The flood also destroyed the canal at the creek's mouth. The same storm system caused the Johnstown Flood, which killed over 2200 people. The Cogan House Covered Bridge {{was the only}} one on Larrys Creek to survive the flood, as a <b>fallen</b> <b>tree</b> formed a protective dam just upstream. The 90foot (27m) long Burr arch truss bridge was built in 1877, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, rehabilitated in 1998, and is today one of just three left in the county.|$|E
5|$|The {{precursor}} to Beryl produced heavy rainfall in Cuba, causing flooding, mudslides and two deaths. Torrential rain also affected south Florida and the Bahamas. After forming, Beryl produced rough surf along the US southeastern coast, leaving one person from Folly Beach, South Carolina missing. Upon making landfall in Florida, the storm produced strong winds that left 38,000people without power. High rains alleviated drought conditions {{and put out}} wildfires along the storm's path. A <b>fallen</b> <b>tree</b> killed a man driving in Orangeburg County, South Carolina. In northeast North Carolina, Beryl spawned an EF1 tornado that snapped trees and damaged dozens of homes {{near the city of}} Peletier. Overall damage was minor, estimated at $148,000.|$|E

5|$|Widespread {{flooding}} and gusty winds destroyed 204 houses along the southeast Texas coastline, {{most of which}} occurred in Matagorda County. In addition, the winds damaged 1,407 homes, with 144 of them being severely damaged. The wind also affected 147 businesses, of which 64 were either destroyed or severely damaged. Strong winds downed numerous power lines, leaving around 74,000 residents without power in the immediate aftermath. Overall, Claudette caused $180million (2003USD, $ USD) in damage in Texas and one death from a <b>fallen</b> <b>tree</b> during the storm. Also, the storm was indirectly responsible for a death when a tree fell on {{a person in the}} aftermath of the storm.|$|E
5|$|Between 1952 and 1954, 398 armored {{vehicles}} were destroyed, 84% {{of them from}} mines and booby traps. Typically, the Viet Minh ambushed convoys by obstructing the road with a <b>fallen</b> <b>tree</b> or pile of boulders, and then destroying {{the first and last}} vehicles of the halted convoy with remote mines. Caltrops, mines and the steep cliff faces naturally found at the road side aided in funneling the target convoy into a small area, where machine guns, mortars and recoilless rifles were trained. Viet Minh Regiment 95 repeatedly deployed these tactics, inflicting severe losses on the French forces passing along Route One, which led to its French nickname of la rue sans joie ("the Street Without Joy"). Regiment 95 was, along with regiments 18 and 101, part of the Viet Minh Division 325, commanded by General Tran Quy Ha. The division was formed in 1951 from pre-existing units in Thừa Thiên just north of Route One, and became operational in the summer of 1952.|$|E
5|$|Moderate wind gusts {{throughout}} the state downed hundreds of trees, tree limbs, and power lines. Over 382,000people were without power, {{one of the worst}} power outages on record for area utilities. Downed trees and power lines closed major streets and schools in Union County. One downed tree greatly damaged a house in Middletown, and in Hudson County several trees fell onto and damaged cars. A downed tree in Englewood injured a woman when she was struck, and a woman in Independence Township was killed when a <b>fallen</b> <b>tree</b> landed on the vehicle she was driving. Strong winds from Isabel blew out the windows in an office building in East Rutherford, causing injuries to two women when they were struck. Throughout the state, damage totaled to about $50million (2003USD, $59million 2008USD).|$|E

50|$|On July 3, 2012, {{the town}} was badly hit by a twister/tornado from two winds colliding in the Perks, Illinois area. None were injured or killed, but several houses were hit by large, <b>falling</b> <b>trees,</b> and one {{uninhabited}} house got completely hit by a <b>falling</b> <b>tree.</b> A barn was destroyed, and pieces went into a cornfield, also ruining a brand new truck.|$|R
5|$|Tropical Depression Nine caused minor {{flooding}} in Central America in September2001. The ninth tropical cyclone of the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season, the depression developed from a tropical wave {{in the southwestern}} Caribbean Sea on September19. Without significant intensification, the depression made landfall in Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua early on September20, which was about six hours after becoming a tropical cyclone. Once inland over Central America, the depression significant deteriorated and dissipated later that day, after lasting for less than 24hours. The remnants emerged into the Pacific Ocean and later developed into Hurricane Juliette. Impact from the depression was rather minor. Although sustained winds on land did not exceed 30mph (55km/h), a <b>fallen</b> <b>tree</b> injured three children in El Salvador. In addition, heavy rainfall flooded at least 200homes in San Salvador and inundated 15farms. The depression {{did not result in}} fatalities and damage caused by it is unknown.|$|E
5|$|In Coffee County, local {{officials}} reported wind gusts had blown a carport {{into a wall}} of a house. Marengo County received moderate damage, mostly limited to power outages and minor roof and structural damage caused by fallen trees and powerlines. Many customers were without electric power {{for at least a}} day, and numerous county roads were covered with debris. A person was injured in Dallas County when a tree landed on their car. Five homes and one business were damaged due to high winds, and thousands of people county-wide experienced power outages. Greene County reported hundreds of downed trees and powerlines causing County Roads 148 and 20 and State Highways 11, 43 and 14 to be temporarily closed. In Forkland, a mobile home caught fire when a powerline fell on the home. A motorist ran into a <b>fallen</b> <b>tree</b> in Boligee although did not sustain injuries. In Perry County, 2,200homes were without electric power for several hours, and several vehicles and homes were damaged. A structural fire occurred in Russell County and was believed to be ignited by downed powerlines.|$|E
5|$|While {{moving through}} the Philippines, Linfa caused {{flooding}} and four separate landslides. The storm's heavy rainfall caused water levels to rise in reservoirs, prompting officials to drain some excess waters from the Binga Dam in Benguet province. Schools were closed in Metro Manila for three days due to flooding and landslides. The storm damaged 18sections of roads, {{as well as two}} bridges and an irrigation canal in San Gabriel, La Union. Slick roads and a <b>fallen</b> <b>tree</b> caused a bus accident in Quezon City, injuring ten people. Portions of Luzon lost power during the storm, including the entirety of La Union province, and Bacnotan briefly lost water access. In the Ilocos region, a Chinese fishing vessel docked at Currimao port ran aground after being battered by huge waves. Three days of high waves washed 30tons of mussels ashore Valladolid, Negros Occidental, prompting officials to use trucks to bury the rotting shells {{to prevent the spread of}} disease. Rough waves also disrupted rescue efforts for an unrelated ferry disaster in the country that killed 54. The storm interacted with the monsoon to spawn two tornadoes in Negros Occidental, as well as strong winds that knocked down trees and billboards. Across Luzon, Linfa damaged 198houses and destroyed another seven. The storm damaged ₱34million ($71,000 USD) worth of crops, and total damage reached ₱214.6 million ($4.8 million USD). Most of the power outages were repaired within a few days of Linfa's passage. After the storm, officials distributed meals to affected residents.|$|E
