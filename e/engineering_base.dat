The same year the airline opened its first air terminal at Les Invalides in central Paris. It was linked to Paris Le Bourget Airport, Air France's first operations and <b>engineering</b> <b>base,</b> by coach. At that time the network covered 160,000km, claimed to be the longest in the world. Société Nationale Air France was set up on 1 January 1946.|$|E

Many of the services to the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man were operated on a seasonal basis — exceptions being year-round operations linking Gatwick with Guernsey, Southampton with both Channel Islands and the Isle of Man with Blackpool and Belfast. BIA's scheduled route network was considerably enlarged in 1979 when it assumed the entire scheduled operation of British Air Ferries (BAF).|$|E

The intent {{of the study was to}} show and prove relationship between the job burnout, job satisfaction and perceived supervisor support. Data was collected from a sample of five <b>engineering</b> <b>based</b> companies. The proposed model was tested by using the regression analysis with SPSS 16. 0. Results of this study show significant implications both for academician and practitioners. Organizations adopt many strategies for developing job satisfaction for many reasons. It helps to create the value in mind of employees. Job burnout intentions literature advocates employees consider the job satisfaction is much more important than other facilities. However these factors that influences have been under emphasized in literature. Current study fill this gap to find the impact of job burnout and supervisor support on job satisfaction in single study.
