30|$|Short-chain {{chlorinated}} paraffins (SCCPs) are complex technical mixtures of halogenated contaminants with linear carbon chain lengths from 10 to 13. The chlorine content ranges from 30 to 70 % (calculated by weight). Technical mixtures {{are used as}} extreme pressure additives in lubricants, flame retardants in plastics and paints, plasticizers in coatings, sealants and adhesives, and in leather <b>fat</b> <b>liquors.</b> They have replaced the PCBs uses in industrial mixtures (De Boer et al. 2010). SCCPs are of great interest due to their persistence, toxicological properties, and high octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow) that make them tend to bioaccumulate in lipid tissues of marine organisms and can be transferred and magnified along the food chain (Feo et al. 2009; Yuan et al. 2012). Besides, SCCPs {{have been found in}} remote areas. In consequence, it is possible to think about their long-range atmospheric transport (Tomy et al. 2000). Chlorinated paraffins (CPs) have similar properties to other persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and already subject to assessment by Stockholm Convention (UNEP/POPS/POPRC. 11 / 4 2015). The western countries have begun to restrict the usage and production of CPs (van Mourik et al. 2016).|$|R

[URL] {{is the main}} structural component of leather, skin, pericardium, and other tissues. All of these biomaterials have a mechanical function and the physical properties are partly {{a result of the}} structure of the collagen fibrils. The architecture of the collagen network and how it changes when different chemical and mechanical processes are applied is not fully understood and forms the foundation of this thesis. Synchrotron-based small angle X-ray scattering has been used to quantify aspects of the collagen structure, specifically the orientation index (OI) and D-spacing of the collagen biomaterials investigated. In leather, the nanostructural changes of the collagen network and the strength of the material across a range of different animals, through each stage of the leather-making process, and when model compounds are added or the <b>fat</b> <b>liquor</b> addition is varied has been investigated. Both the D-spacing and fibril orientation were found to change with leather processing. The changes to the thickness of the leather during processing impacts the fibril OI and, once taken into account, the main difference in OI is due to the hydration state of the material with dry materials being less oriented than wet. Model compounds urea, proline, and hydroxyproline were found to increase D-spacing. It was found that as the <b>fat</b> <b>liquor</b> addition is increased, the D-spacing increased. Pure lanolin resulted in a similar increase in Dspacing. The collagen fibril structure and strength of both adult and neonatal pericardium was also investigated. Significant differences were observed with the neonatal tissue having a higher modulus of elasticity and being significantly more aligned than adult pericardium. Neonatal pericardium is advantageously thinner for heart valve applications. This research proves it has the necessary physical properties required. By understanding the hierarchical structure of collagen and its mechanisms for modification when subjected to different chemical and mechanical processes, we gain valuable insight in understanding the performance of leather and skin in biological, medical, and industrial contexts. This will lead to better comprehension of current processes and informs future processing developments...|$|R
40|$|In today's move to "sustainable production" {{the leather}} industry, {{as well as}} many other {{industries}} is recognized as a polluting one. Traditional chemical operations are polluting because of the levels of inorganic chemical waste. Process chemicals which are not consumed within the reactions necessary to convert collagen to leather are currently discharged to waste. These are usually applied during bulk production, such as inorganic agents from beam house and tanning processes, e. g. lime, sulphide, ammonium salts, sulphuric acid and sodium chloride, mineral tanning agents – mainly Cr(III) and the less common Al(III), Zr(III), Ti(III), Fe(III) salts -, whereas depending on the tanning process and the leather article produced organic chemical waste discharged comprises aldehydic and polyphenolic tanning products, bating enzymes, organic carboxylic acids and excess electrolyte stable synthetic <b>fat</b> <b>liquors.</b> It is rare for chemicals and water to be recovered for re-use from several of these process steps. Moreover, tanners worldwide are required to operate within strict legislative boundaries. Serious drawbacks continuously arise concerning the chrome–tanning process in leather industry and the environmental hazardous consequences of chromium containing effluents. In order to overcome this impediment, a great deal of research has been focused on developing chrome–free tanning methods in the past years, such as titanium tanning. In the present study, Ti–Al tanned bovine leather was characterized by means of SEM microscopy, EDAX elemental analysis, ATR–FTIR spectroscopy, thermogravimetry TGA, and differential scanning calorimetry DSC techniques. ...|$|R

This report provides the updated risk assessment dealing with new data {{and the consequences of}} the new data for the conclusions in the original report. The report has been prepared by the United Kingdom in the frame of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 793 / 93 on the evaluation and control of the risks of existing substances, following the principles for assessment of the risks to man and the environment, laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1488 / 94. This report considers the secondary poisoning assessment and the exposure of man via the environment based on new information. This update includes also the PBT assessment which was not addressed in the original report for medium chain chlorinated paraffins. The updated {{environmental risk}} assessment concludes that risks are identified for the earthworm food chain due to various uses of MCCPs.

40|$|The {{interest}} in the carcinogenic and biological actions of N-nitroso compounds arose following the reports of the hepatotoxicity by Freund ' and Barnes and Magee 2 and ofcarcinogenicity (Magee and Barnes) 3 of the simplest nitrosamine: N-nitrosodimethylamine (dimethylnitrosamine) and the subsequent observa-tion of Schoental 4 and Druckrey et aP on the carcin-ogenic action of the nitrosamides: n-methyl N-nitrosourethane and N-methyl N-nitrosurea. Magee and Barnes in 1956 showed the carcinogenic effects of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in rats. Evidence that certain consumer and industrial products contain N-nitroso compounds led to speculation that workers in the industries that either use or manufacture nitrosamine precursors (amines and nitrogen oxides) may be exposed to these agents. ' One such industry is leather tanning. Dimethylamine sulphate (DMAS, a precursor of N-nitrosodimeth-ylamine NDMA) is used in leather tanneries as a depilatory agent in the hide process (P Walker et al, MITRE Corporation report MTR 7152, 1976). Following these observations, Rounbehler et al carried out a study of human exposure to N-nitrosamine by examining work environments of the leather tanneries. 9 Different amounts ofNDMA were detected in air samples taken from different sites in the tannery. The highest levels, up to 47 pg/m 3 were in the retanning, colouring, and <b>fat</b> <b>liquoring</b> area. Fridman et al detected a nitrosamine group attached to various other groups in different samples by using infrared spectroscopy; nitrosamines show an intense band in the infrared region caused by the vibration of the N = 0 bond.
