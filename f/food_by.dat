5000|$|According to the World Health Organization, {{nutrient}} profiling classifies and/or ranks <b>foods</b> <b>by</b> their {{nutritional composition}} {{in order to}} promote human (and/or animal) health and to prevent disease. [...] Ranking by nutrient density is one such nutrient profiling strategy. Ordering <b>foods</b> <b>by</b> nutrient density is a statistical method of comparing <b>foods</b> <b>by</b> the proportion of nutrients in foods. Some such comparisons can be the glycemic index and the Overall Nutritional Quality Index.|$|R
50|$|Decomposition of {{food stores}} {{appears to be}} a {{constant}} challenge. Woodrats seem to exhibit physiological adaptions that allow them to consume <b>food</b> inhabited <b>by</b> fungi. Fungi can increase nutritional value of some <b>foods</b> <b>by</b> making nutrients within <b>food</b> more accessible <b>by</b> breaking down complex carbohydrates, which woodrats may exploit.|$|R

5|$|Agaricus hondensis {{mushrooms}} are toxic, and consuming the fruit bodies causes gastroenteritis. Some fruit bodies smell of creosote, an odor that {{becomes even more}} prevalent if the {{mushrooms are}} cooked. Cooking also introduces an unpleasant soapy-metallic flavor. The fruit bodies are used as <b>food</b> <b>by</b> the vagrant shrew (Sorex vagrans) and the American shrew mole (Neurotrichus gibbsii). Relatively high levels of the chemical hydroquinone are present in fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|Although {{recorded}} in small numbers sporadically throughout twentieth century {{it was not}} until the 1980s that Grey-headed flying foxes routinely visited Melbourne.

25|$|Aboriginal {{traditional}} native food use {{has been}} severely affected by non-indigenous immigration since 1788, {{especially in the}} more densely colonised areas of south-eastern Australia. There, the introduction of non-native foods to Aboriginals has resulted in an almost complete abandonment of native <b>foods</b> <b>by</b> Aboriginals. This impact on traditional foods has been further accentuated {{by the loss of}} traditional lands which has resulted in reduced access to native <b>foods</b> <b>by</b> Aboriginals and destruction of native habitat for agriculture.|$|R

5|$|Frogs {{are valued}} as <b>food</b> <b>by</b> humans and also have many {{cultural}} roles in literature, symbolism and religion. Frog populations have declined significantly since the 1950s. More than {{one third of}} species {{are considered to be}} threatened with extinction and over one hundred and twenty are believed to have become extinct since the 1980s. The number of malformations among frogs is on the rise and an emerging fungal disease, chytridiomycosis, has spread around the world. Conservation biologists are working to understand the causes of these problems and to resolve them.|$|E
5|$|High {{levels of}} both {{sugar and salt}} can {{preserve}} <b>food</b> <b>by</b> preventing micro-organisms from growing. Green beans can be salted by layering the pods with salt, but this method of preservation is unsuited to most vegetables. Marrows, beetroot, carrot, and some other vegetables can be boiled with sugar to create jams. Vinegar is widely used in food preservation; a sufficient concentration of acetic acid prevents the development of destructive micro-organisms, a fact made use of {{in the preparation of}} pickles, chutneys and relishes. Fermentation is another method of preserving vegetables for later use. Sauerkraut is made from chopped cabbage and relies on lactic acid bacteria which produce compounds that are inhibitory to the growth of other micro-organisms.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after hatching, turtles are {{dependent}} on egg yolk material for sustenance. About a week to {{a week and a}} half after emerging from their eggs (or the following spring if emergence is delayed), hatchlings begin feeding to support growth. The young turtles grow rapidly at first, sometimes doubling their size in the first year. Growth slows sharply at sexual maturity and may stop completely. Likely owing to differences of habitat and <b>food</b> <b>by</b> water body, growth rates often differ from population to population in the same area. Among the subspecies, the western painted turtles are the quickest growers.|$|E

5|$|Koalas were {{hunted for}} <b>food</b> <b>by</b> Aboriginals. A common {{technique}} used {{to capture the}} animals was to attach a loop of ropey bark {{to the end of}} a long, thin pole, so as to form a noose. This would be used to snare an animal high in a tree, beyond the reach of a climbing hunter; an animal brought down this way would then be killed with a stone hand axe or hunting stick (waddy). According to the customs of some tribes, it was considered taboo to skin the animal, while other tribes thought the animal's head had a special status, and saved them for burial.|$|E
5|$|Many {{animals can}} learn {{behaviours}} by imitation, but ants {{may be the}} only group apart from mammals where interactive teaching has been observed. A knowledgeable forager of Temnothorax albipennis will lead a naive nest-mate to newly discovered <b>food</b> <b>by</b> the process of tandem running. The follower obtains knowledge through its leading tutor. The leader is acutely sensitive to the progress of the follower and slows down when the follower lags and speeds up when the follower gets too close.|$|E
5|$|Many teleosts form shoals, {{which serve}} {{multiple}} purposes in different species. Schooling is sometimes an antipredator adaptation, offering improved vigilance against predators. It {{is often more}} efficient to gather <b>food</b> <b>by</b> working as a group, and individual fish optimise their strategies by choosing to join or leave a shoal. When a predator has been noticed, prey fish respond defensively, resulting in collective shoal behaviours such as synchronised movements. Responses do not consist only of attempting to hide or flee; antipredator tactics include for example scattering and reassembling. Fish also aggregate in shoals to spawn.|$|E

5|$|Millipedes {{appear in}} {{folklore}} and traditional medicine around the world. Some cultures associate millipede activity with coming rains. In the Yoruba culture of Nigeria, millipedes {{are used in}} pregnancy and business rituals, and crushed millipedes are used to treat fever, whitlow, and convulsion in children. In Zambia, smashed millipede pulp is used to treat wounds, and the Bafia people of Cameroon use millipede juice to treat earache. In certain Himalayan Bhotiya tribes, dry millipede smoke is used to treat haemorrhoids. Native people in Malaysia use millipede secretions in poison-tipped arrows. The secretions of Spirobolus bungii have been observed to inhibit division of human cancer cells. The only recorded usage of millipedes as <b>food</b> <b>by</b> humans comes from the Bobo people of Burkina Faso, who consume boiled, dried millipedes in tomato sauce.|$|E
5|$|One day, Neto {{travels with}} his friend Lobo to Santos without informing his parents. They go to an {{apartment}} where they swim and eat food; Neto leaves the place when Lobo suggests that they reciprocate for the <b>food</b> <b>by</b> letting the men there caress them. Alone in downtown, Neto begs for money, and he is helped by a woman called Leninha. She takes him home {{to have lunch with}} some friends; after it, Neto and Leninha have sex. Later, at night, he is arrested for doing graffiti, and his parents pick him up at the police station. The following day, Neto is in his bedroom and his father finds a marijuana cigarette in his jacket. Neto's sister advises his parents to send him to a mental institution.|$|E
5|$|Premastication, pre-chewing, or kiss feeding is the act {{of chewing}} food {{for the purpose of}} {{physically}} breaking it down in order to feed another that is incapable of masticating the <b>food</b> <b>by</b> themselves. This is often done by the mother or relatives of a baby to produce baby food capable of being consumed by the child during the weaning process.
