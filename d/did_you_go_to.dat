[...] Zhang responded that Chiang still had power, {{even though he}} had technically retired, and that his consent would be needed to finalize any agreement. [...] Zhou responded that the CCP would not accept a bogus peace dictated by Chiang, and asked whether Zhang had come with the necessary credentials to implement the terms desired by the CCP. Negotiations continued until 15 April, when Zhou produced a [...] "final version" [...] of a [...] "draft agreement for internal peace", which was essentially an ultimatum to accept CCP demands. [...] The KMT government did not respond after five days, signaling that it was not prepared to accept Zhou's demands.|$|E

6000|$|When we {{had been}} at Yarmouth three days, I met my old companion, who had given me the {{invitation}} to go on board along with his father. His behaviour and speech were altered, and in a melancholy manner asked me how I did, telling his father who I was, & how I had made this voyage only for a trial to proceed further abroad. Upon which the old gentleman turning to me gravely, said, [...] "Young man, you ought never {{to go to sea}} any more, but to take this for a certain sign that you never will prosper in a sea-faring condition."

Moi qui vous parle, sir!--do you suppose I have had no humble-pie to eat? All of us in our turn are called upon to swallow it: and, now you are no longer the Fortunate Youth, be the Clever Youth, and win back the place you have lost by your ill luck. Go about more than ever. Go to all the routs and parties to which you are asked, and to more still. Be civil to everybody--to all women especially. Only of course take care to show your spirit, of which you have plenty. With economy, and by your brother's, I must say, admirable generosity, you can still make a genteel figure. With your handsome person, sir, you can't fail to get a rich heiress. Tenez! You should go amongst the merchants in the City, and look out there. They won't know that you are out of fashion at the Court end of the town. With a little management, there is not the least reason, sir, why you should not make a good position for yourself still. When <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> see my Lady Yarmouth, pray? Why did you not improve that connexion? She took a great fancy to you. I desire you will be constant at her ladyship's evenings, and lose no opportunity of paying court to her." ...|$|E
