25|$|Engine offerings again {{included}} 350 and 455-cubic-inch Rocket V8s {{ranging from}} 250 to 340 gross horsepower, {{all of which}} featured lowered compression ratios beginning in 1971 to enable use of lower octane regular leaded 91 RON octane, low-lead or unleaded gasoline. Vented power front disc brakes and variable-ratio power steering were now standard equipment on all 88 models. During the 1971 model year the Turbo Hydra-matic 400 transmission {{was added to the}} standard <b>equipment</b> <b>list.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 1967 models saw a new semiconcave squared {{tail light}} {{design and the}} five-dial {{instrument}} cluster with a round speedometer at the very center. The best change for the year appeared {{in the form of}} the fully synchronized 150-T model three-speed manual transmission as standard equipment, meaning the end of non-synchromesh units in VAM cars. The new transmission was joined by a 3.73:1 rear differential gear ratio. Hazard lights were added to the standard <b>equipment</b> <b>list.</b>|$|E
25|$|Before the flight, {{the crew}} {{found that one}} of the two main power {{generators}} was defective since 6 September, and the mechanic who inspected the aircraft was unable to repair it. In the Norwegian jurisdiction an aircraft is only allowed to take off if it has two operable sources of power. Also the aircraft's Minimum <b>Equipment</b> <b>List</b> required two operating generators. The first officer decided that he would run the auxiliary power unit (APU) throughout the flight so that the flight would have two sources of power and therefore be allowed to leave.|$|E

25|$|Volkswagen Sedán City.- This was {{a budget}} version {{with all the}} {{equipment}} reduced to its minimum expression, disappearing from the <b>equipment</b> <b>list</b> elements such as: the door armrests, the automatic front seat belts, the rear seat belts, the front disc brakes, and the central bumper black stripe. This version was only available in Verona Red (from 1997 in Tornado Red) and Bright White. Its upholstery was new cloth with vinyl in Grey Frannel. One way to distinguish the Volkswagen Sedán City was that the City had no Sedan black sticker on its bumpers, which was the norm {{in the rest of}} the Volkswagen Beetles.|$|E
25|$|The ground-maintenance crew {{locked out}} the thrust {{reverser}} for engine #3 (treated as a minimum <b>equipment</b> <b>list</b> item) because of technical {{problems with the}} thrust reverser sensors during the landing of TWA 881 at JFK, prior to Flight 800's departure. Additionally, severed cables for the engine #3 thrust reverser were replaced. During refueling of the aircraft, the volumetric shutoff (VSO) control was {{believed to have been}} triggered before the tanks were full. To continue the pressure fueling, a TWA mechanic overrode the automatic VSO by pulling the volumetric fuse and an overflow circuit breaker. Maintenance records indicate that the airplane had numerous VSO-related maintenance writeups in the weeks before the accident.|$|E
25|$|The 1980 models {{gained a}} higher {{appointment}} of {{safety in the}} form of a locking gas cap, fold-down high-back individual seats with adjustable headrests, and the heater was made standard even on the most economical versions. New features included a split rear seat back, a 180km/h / 110mph speedometer, new seat patterns, a seven-blade flexible fan for the 258 six, new steering wheel designs for each trim level, and a new VAM grille design shared between the two versions. The X model included a new side decal design and blacked out hubcaps. The optional <b>equipment</b> <b>list</b> for the Gremlin X included a new AM FM stereo radio, electric antenna, and intermittent wipers.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{interest in the}} faulty air temperature probe (the total air temperature sensor, located {{on the front of}} the aircraft near the cockpit) that initially caused the pilot to turn the plane back for maintenance before the second takeoff attempt. The mechanic simply deactivated the probe because the aircraft's Minimum <b>Equipment</b> <b>List</b> allowed it to be left inoperative. On 22 August investigators interviewed the mechanic, who defended his action by saying that it had nothing to do with the crash. Spanair has supported the mechanic's view that deactivation of the probe is an accepted procedure. On 1 September a report, quoting Spanair, stated that the problem detected on the first takeoff attempt was overheating caused by a temperature gauge's de-icing system, rather than a dysfunction of the temperature gauge itself, and that since icing was not a risk on that flight, the de-icing system had been deactivated by the mechanic with captain's approval.|$|E
25|$|VAM {{originally}} intended the Rally SST to include as standard equipment only the same accessories as the 1981 Rally GT and the optional <b>equipment</b> <b>list</b> of the 1981 Rally AMX except {{for its own}} share of exclusive and not available accessories. However, the same story as the 1980 Rally GT repeated itself for the 1981 Rally SST. The need to stress differences between not just the three-version Rally line but also the new Spirit-based Lerma model forced VAM to act any way it could. Once again, the company's sales department determined that virtually all Rally SST units included all optional convenience accessories available in the Rally line from the factory. The final list of equipment for the Rally SST consisted of a tinted windshield, intermittent wipers, rear defroster, electric antenna, full light group including reading dome light, AM-FM stereo radio, quartz clock, center console with compartment and armrest with rear ashtray, lighted vanity mirror, side armrest safety reflectors, cigarette lighter, front ashtray, locking glove box, leather wrapped sports steering wheel, inside hood release, air conditioning, parcel shelf, power door locks, power windows, power trunk release, dual remote-controlled mirrors, reclining bucket seats, retractable seatbelts, and removable trunk cover.|$|E
2500|$|Power {{windows and}} a power driver's seat became {{standard}} on all Electra models in 1975. Also new to the standard <b>equipment</b> <b>list</b> were radial-ply tires. The 1975 Electra {{was one of the}} first GM vehicles to offer an Air Cushion Restraint System or [...] "airbag".|$|E

2500|$|Given {{the model}} {{designation}} JG, the Holden Cruze was launched with the 1.8-liter petrol engine and optional 2.0-liter turbodiesel. Both engines are mated to the five-speed manual transmission or optional six-speed automatic. Electronic stability control (ESC), seat belt pretensioners and six airbags were standard fitment across the range. Specification-wise, the [...] "CD" [...] {{opened up the}} range, finished off with a more upmarket [...] "CDX". The [...] "CD" [...] <b>equipment</b> <b>list</b> comprised 16-inch steel wheels, air conditioning, cruise control, a trip computer, power windows and automatic headlamps. [...] "CDX" [...] versions add 17-inch alloy wheels, front fog lamps, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and upholstery, heated front seats and rear parking sensors. Initially a petrol-only model, diesel availability was expanded to the [...] "CDX" [...] trim in early 2010.|$|E
2500|$|The American ECD {{was once}} again {{restricted}} to the four-door sedan only for 1977. The model incorporated the new Gremlin front clip {{like the rest of}} the American line of the year. The [...] "258" [...] engine displacement emblems were replaced by new [...] "4.2" [...] units and the bumper guards were included free of extra charge. Power brakes were moved to the standard <b>equipment</b> <b>list.</b> Most of the light group was also installed as standard equipment; aside from the already existing courtesy lights came the hood light, trunk light and glove box light. The electric clock was fully standardized in all units. Front seat belts were upgraded into three-point retractable units. The rear seat back got a concealed fold-down armrest. AMC's original factory air conditioning system for the first time became available as optional equipment. The Carter RBS one-barrel carburetor was discontinued leaving only the Carter YF model.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in 1978 the Volkswagen Beetle {{introduced}} {{air vents}} {{on the front}} trunk cover to bring fresh air to the interior. The air exited {{through a couple of}} rear vents behind the rear side windows. Hub caps disappeared from the <b>equipment</b> <b>list</b> in all models. With the cancellation of production in Germany, the Mexican Volkswagen Beetle started exporting to European markets, including West Germany, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland, and other countries. This exportation model was different from the Mexican market Beetle. [...] Its engine was a 1.2l 34 CV DIN. From the 1982 model on, the engine cover had no exterior vents. The different engine cover made it similar to German-produced VW 1200, as well as Mexican market Beetles sold before 1970. Also introduced were optional metallic paint colors: Silver Metallic, Copper Red Metallic, Cadmium Blue Metallic and Viper Green Metallic. [...] These colors were also available on the Caribe and the new European market Volkswagen Scirocco, as a reminder of the late 1970s models.|$|E

50|$|Next the <b>equipment</b> <b>listing</b> {{contained}} {{variations on}} the devices already noted in the basic rules equipment section. There were lots of weapons, some protective devices, and a few gadgets such as belt lights, chronometers, and advanced tricorders.|$|R
2500|$|The 1981 {{model year}} {{represented}} a radical upgrade for VAM's top performance line. An all-new [...] "rally" [...] emblem design in all-lower case letters and computer-like typography appeared on both front fenders. The Rally AMX obtained a new [...] "waved" [...] stripe design {{located on the}} front edge of the hood and fenders with an integrated [...] "AMX" [...] leyend on the right front corner. It was very discreet compared to the last year's decals while the [...] "AMX over Rally" [...] and [...] "4.6 Litros" [...] stickers were removed. The Rally GT got also discreet [...] "GT" [...] stickers for the front of the hood bulge and [...] "GT 4.6/X" [...] stickers for the right corner of the rear spoiler. The previous year's [...] "American GT" [...] side decals and [...] "GT" [...] central rear spoiler emblem were deleted. Both versions shared all-new impressive Recardo-type reclining bucket seats with adjustable headrests, all new door panels in vinyl with cloth and carpet inserts but that no longer had map pouches, AMC's barred grille design used in the Eagle models made in aluminum instead of plastic, international symbols on the instrument cluster warning lights, the high beams switch integrated to the steering column, a new leather-wrapped sports steering wheel design with six fake Allen bolts on the horn button forming a hexagon, AM/FM stereo radio with four speakers as standard equipment and higher quality dashboard woodgrain panels. Mechanically, the coolant recovery tank and fan shroud became present. The optional <b>equipment</b> <b>list</b> was vastly improved; the set of power doorlocks and windows that debuted the year before in the American (Concord) line became available in the Rally. The GT got the electric antenna while the AMX included the rear spoiler with electric trunk release, both as standard equipment. The full optional <b>equipment</b> <b>list</b> for the Rally AMX was air conditioning, automatic transmission, intermittent wipers, reading dome light, rear defroster, sports steel wheels, electric antenna, power door locks and power windows; the list of the Rally GT was restricted to the electric locks and windows only {{while the rest of the}} accessories were standard except for the unavailable automatic transmission and air conditioning.|$|E
2500|$|All {{the quality}} and {{engineering}} upgrades and revisions seen on AMC cars for 1972 were also present in Mexico. The 1972 VAM Javelin saw considerable improvements {{in terms of both}} performance and sportiness. Heavy duty springs and shocks along with front sway bar were passed on to the standard <b>equipment</b> <b>list,</b> as also were power front disk brakes and power steering, all regardless of transmission. Units equipped with the four-speed manual transmission changed to a rear differential gear ratio of 3.31:1 and included a center console with locking compartment as standard equipment. The [...] "Shift-Command" [...] Borg-Warner automatic transmissions were replaced by the new [...] "Torque Command" [...] Chrysler-built A998 TorqueFlite. The chromed grille applied on the tail light lenses and the new rectangular grid front grille of the AMC Javelins arrived for the VAM models. The exterior included for the first time factory stripe designs. The interior saw new seat patterns and a new three-spoke sports steering wheel with an [...] "American Motors" [...] legend on the transparent plastic cap of the horn button. A new steering column design with a built-in safety lever to engage the steering lock came and the mechanism blocking the shifters to ignition switch departed.|$|E
2500|$|For 1981, the Spirit sedan-based VAM Gremlin saw the {{greatest}} changes since 1979. Both versions obtained a 55-amp alternator, coolant recovery tank and fan shroud regardless of trim level or {{the presence of}} the air conditioning system, as well as a new shared grille design with vertical bars and a single horizontal one in the bottom plus a shared new seat pattern design. For the first time, door panels completely covered all previously exposed metal parts. International symbols appeared in the instrument cluster warning lights and the light beam switch was integrated to the steering column marker light lever. The Gremlin X received numerous updates. All chromed items were deleted other than the front end and rear licence plate light housings while the rear spoiler passed on to the option list. Both bumpers changed to blacked out units. Side decals were almost gone, with only a small [...] "Gremlin X" [...] one at the bottom corner of each C-pillar. A new leather-wrapped sports steering wheel with six simulated hex socket bolts on the horn button was used. A four speed manual transmission with Hurst linkage and a 3.07:1 rear gear ratio became standard. Units with automatic transmission retained the 3.31:1 rear gear ratio of all previous years. The optional <b>equipment</b> <b>list</b> now included eight-spoke sports-style steel wheels using the same volcano hubcaps as the standard wheels.|$|E
50|$|Some {{attempts}} were made to keep the rules updated, an example is the Nikita Corps Commander & Korps Commander Site, which updated the <b>equipment</b> <b>lists.</b> A more extensive attempt {{can be seen in the}} Corps Commander Group Site.|$|R
