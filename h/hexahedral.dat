5000|$|In {{addition}} to triangles and tetrahedra, other commonly used elements in finite element simulation include quadrilateral (4-noded) and <b>hexahedral</b> (8-noded) elements in 2D and 3D, respectively. One {{of the most}} commonly used algorithms to generate unstructured quadrilateral grid is [...] "Paving". However, there is no such commonly used algorithm for generating unstructured <b>hexahedral</b> grid on a general 3D solid model. [...] "Plastering" [...] is a 3D version of Paving, , but it has difficulty in forming <b>hexahedral</b> elements at the interior of a solid.|$|E
5000|$|... 4) Running the Simulation: This {{is where}} the nightmares for the non-structured mesh begin. Since it takes six tetrahedrals to {{represent}} one <b>hexahedral</b> the tet mesh size will be considerably larger and will require a lot more computing power and RAM to solve an equivalent <b>hexahedral</b> mesh. The tetrahedral mesh will also require more relaxation factors to solve the simulation by effectively dampening the amplitude of the gradients. This increases the number of sub-cycle steps and drives the courant number up. If you built a <b>hexahedral</b> mesh this {{is where the}} tortoise passes the hare.|$|E

50|$|However, {{there are}} ways of quickly {{building}} a <b>hexahedral</b> mesh such as using a 2D quad mesh and projecting into the z-direction. Another method is building a block structured mesh by using a CAD based program to create logically connected splines. After the blocks are built the cell factors {{are added to the}} blocks and the mesh created. One significant advantage of using a block based <b>hexahedral</b> mesh is the mesh can be smoothed very quickly. For large complex geometric models the process of building a <b>hexahedral</b> mesh can take days, weeks and even months depending on the skill level and tool sets available to the analyst.|$|E
50|$|Discovered by Dr. Peter Murdoch on 16 September 1993, {{the spatial}} twist {{continuum}} {{is a method}} {{that can be used}} in automatic and semi-automatic mesh generation methods to create all <b>hexahedral</b> meshes for both computational fluid dynamics and finite element method applications. The name is derived from the description of the surfaces that define the connectivity of the <b>hexahedral</b> elements. The surfaces are arranged in the three principal dimensions such that they form orthogonal intersections that conicide with the centroid of the <b>hexahedral</b> element. They are arranged predominately coplanar to each other in their respective dimensions yet they can twist into the other dimensional planes through transitions. The surfaces are unbroken throughout the entire volume of the mesh hence they are continuums.|$|E
50|$|The spatial twist {{continuum}} is a dual {{representation of}} an all <b>hexahedral</b> mesh {{that defines the}} global connectivity constraint.|$|E

Here {{we can see}} technique of conversion from square foundation of ziarathona to octahedral and then to <b>hexahedral</b> shapes. This technique was accomplished using stalactite [...] "sails". There are small windows in the <b>hexahedral</b> part; soft sunlight shines through them. Above it - a cap of the dome, this concludes whole space.|$|E

50|$|A hexahedron, a topological cube, has 8 vertices, 12 edges, {{bounded by}} 6 {{quadrilateral}} faces. It is also called a hex or a brick. For the same cell amount, {{the accuracy of}} solutions in <b>hexahedral</b> meshes is the highest.|$|E
5000|$|... 6) Making design changes: If {{you build}} a non-structured mesh {{this is where you}} go back to the {{beginning}} and start all over again. If {{you build a}} <b>hexahedral</b> mesh then you make the geometric change, re-smooth the mesh and restart the simulation.|$|E

Also found was a bronze cauldron {{with a level of}} craftsmanship that is today achieved by using an inert gas environment.|$|E
5000|$|As it is {{described}} above, the Cheugugi was mainly made of iron. By observing the preserved one, {{it is generally}} characterized by its oil-drum shape which is fixed on the <b>hexahedral</b> stone support, Cheugudae (측우대). The reasonable height of the Cheugudae means the splashed water can't flow into the Cheugugi.|$|E
5000|$|The first [...] "official release" [...] of STAR-CCM+ {{included}} the world's first commercially available polyhedral meshing algorithm. The {{use of a}} polyhedral mesh {{has proven to be}} more accurate for fluid-flow problems than a <b>hexahedral</b> or tetrahedral mesh of a similar size (number of cells), but is considerably more difficult to create.|$|E
50|$|Code_Saturne is a {{general-purpose}} computational {{fluid dynamics}} free computer software package.

50|$|Two large volumes, {{a reverse}} cone {{and a simple}} <b>hexahedral</b> shape, form Museum 1. Mario Botta {{utilized}} terra cotta bricks on the building’s façade which creates not only a strong presence on the grounds but also creates a chameleon like façade which changes colors, and plays with shadows, with the changing intensity and angle of sunlight. The shapes and materials create a modern interpretation of Seoul’s history as a walled city and reference the traditional ceramic art inside. The interior of Museum 1 includes a lobby, rotunda, and exhibition spaces. The core of the Leeum Museum is this basement lobby created by the reverse cone penetrating the ground. Museum 2 and the Samsung Child Education & Culture Center are all connected here. Museum goers begin and end their tours in this area. Above the lobby is the white walled rotunda. Spiraling down like a helix, the rotunda delivers natural lightinto the basement lobby and exhibition spaces. The exhibition spaces in Museum 1 are <b>hexahedral.</b> Visitors begin {{at the top and}} walk down visiting each of the four floors which house ceramics, swords, jewelry and other traditional Korean artifacts.|$|E
5000|$|The Mausoleum of the Shirvanshahs is {{rectangular}} and {{crowned with}} a <b>hexahedral</b> cupola that is decorated from outside with multi-radial stars. The inscription on the entrance doorway indicates {{the purpose of}} the building: [...] "Khalilullah I, the greatest Soltan, Great Shirvanshah, the namesake of the divine prophet, the defender of the religion ordered to construct this light burial-vault for his mother and son in 839" [...] (1435-1436). On two drop-shaped medallions in the flannel parts of the portal there are inscriptions with the architect's name — Memar Ali (architect Ali).|$|E
50|$|This diamond {{had some}} inclusions, {{yet it was}} an unmistakably {{colourless}} gem. The diamond did not display a definite crystallographic habit and was often incorrectly {{referred to as a}} 'cleavage piece'. If a resin model of the diamond is studied however, one would find no evidence of mechanical or natural cleavage on the diamond. The morphology of this diamond was due to plastic deformation during the eruption phase of the kimberlite. The diamond did not exhibit any trigons on the octahedral faces (111) or noticeable striae on the dodecahedral faces (110) and the crystallographic orientation was derived from the presence of two orthogonal inversions on one of the <b>hexahedral</b> faces (100).|$|E
50|$|If the {{accuracy}} {{is of the}} highest concern then <b>hexahedral</b> mesh is the most preferable one. The density of the mesh is required to be sufficiently high in order to capture all the flow features but on the same note, {{it should not be}} so high that it captures unnecessary details of the flow, thus burdening the CPU and wasting more time. Whenever a wall is present, the mesh adjacent to the wall is fine enough to resolve the boundary layer flow and generally quad, hex and prism cells are preferred over triangles, tetrahedrons and pyramids. Quad and Hex cells can be stretched where the flow is fully developed and one-dimensional. Based on the skewness, smoothness, and aspect ratio, the suitability of the mesh can be decided.|$|E
50|$|In 1929, Melnikov {{proposed}} {{the same system}} of intersecting cyliitecture - is a honeycomb lattice shell made of bricks with <b>hexahedral</b> cells.The similar lattice shells out of metal were patented andbuilt by Vladimir Shukhov in 1896. Melnikov built his house in 1927-1929, {{and by that time}} in Russia there had been already built about 200 Shukhov’s steel lattice shells as the overhead covers of buildings, hyperboloid water and other towers,including the famous 160 meter radio tower in Moscow (1922). Since Melnikov and Shukhov were well acquainted with each other and made joint projects (Bakhmetevsky Bus Garage, Novo-Ryazanskaya Street Garage), {{it is not surprising that}} the Melnikov’s house in Krivoarbatsky pereulok was built in the form of an original lattice shell. The overhead covers of the own Мelnikov’s house are the honeycomb lattice shells made of wooden boards placed edgewise.|$|E
50|$|The “Sumakh” carpets {{present one}} of the {{interesting}} types of flat-weave carpets, which have become widely spread and recognized over the last few centuries. Beginning with the 18th century “Sumakhs” {{have been made in the}} Quba nd Gusary districts. “Sumakhs” were created much later than other types of flat-woven carpets. In the early stage of their development they might have had their own individual composition, but the “Sumakhs” of the 18th-20th centuries reproduce the compositions and patters copied from the pile carpets made in Shirvan, Quba, Karabakh and Ganja. The technological peculiarity of “Sumakh” lies in their rich composition and colors. The diverse stylized vegetal motifs, various geometrical elements such as large <b>hexahedral,</b> square, rhomboid medallions impart festive beauty to “Sumakh”. The traditional pattern includes the minor edge with a wave-like pattern, which is called “dolan-gach” (pass around - run away). It is used basically in all “Sumakh” type carpets.|$|E
50|$|Medical image {{computing}} typically {{operates on}} uniformly sampled data with regular x-y-z spatial spacing (images in 2D and volumes in 3D, generically {{referred to as}} images). At each sample point, data is commonly represented in integral form such as signed and unsigned short (16-bit), although forms from unsigned char (8-bit) to 32-bit float are not uncommon. The particular meaning of the data at the sample point depends on modality: for example a CT acquisition collects radiodensity values, while a MRI acquisition may collect T1 or T2-weighted images. Longitudinal, time-varying acquisitions {{may or may not}} acquire images with regular time steps. Fan-like images due to modalities such as curved-array ultrasound are also common and require different representational and algorithmic techniques to process. Other data forms include sheared images due to gantry tilt during acquisition; and unstructured meshes, such as <b>hexahedral</b> and tetrahedral forms, which are used in advanced biomechanical analysis (e.g., tissue deformation, vascular transport, bone implants).|$|E
5000|$|Sceptre of Tsar Peter I Alekseevich The sceptre {{belonging}} to Tsar Peter I {{was made of}} gold and adorned with colour enamels and precious stones. The <b>hexahedral</b> scepter divides into three with three bolsters and its lower part ends with a bolster with a figured knob. The sceptre's form and details {{are close to the}} sceptre of Tsar Michael Fyodorovich of the 17th century. The decor reflects artistic taste of the late 17th century. Black and pink enamels on blue background, vegetation ornament of miniature graceful tulips, leaves and curls - all these have analogies in artworks by Kremlin jewelers of the 80-90-s of the 17th century. The sceptre must have been executed in 1682 on the occasion of setting for reigning of brothers Ivan and Peter Alekseevich. While the ceremonial, Ivan Alekseevich took the scepter of his grandfather, and the new sceptre, created following the pattern of the worshipped holy, was brought for the younger Tsar, Peter Alekseevich.|$|E
5000|$|This shape {{has been}} used as a test case for <b>hexahedral</b> mesh generation, {{simplifying}} an earlier test case of Rob Schneider in the form of a square pyramid with its boundary subdivided into 16 quadrilaterals. In this context the tetragonal trapezohedron has also been called the cubical octahedron, [...] quadrilateral octahedron, or octagonal spindle, because it has eight quadrilateral faces and is uniquely defined as a combinatorial polyhedron by that property. Adding four cuboids to a mesh for the cubical octahedron would also give a mesh for Schneider's pyramid. As a simply-connected polyhedron with an even number of quadrilateral faces, the cubical octahedron can be decomposed into topological cuboids with curved faces that meet face-to-face without subdividing the boundary quadrilaterals, [...] and an explicit mesh of this type has been constructed. However, it is unclear whether a decomposition of this type can be obtained in which all the cuboids are convex polyhedra with flat faces.|$|E
50|$|Reorganization of the siloxanecage-like core (T8 → T10) can be performed, includingisolation of intermediates, and cage {{rearrangement}} {{achieved by}} using Bronstedsuperacid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (CF3SO3H). In this case, reaction of <b>hexahedral</b> silsesquioxane and CF3SO3H in DMSO conducted in 1 : 12 molar ratio gives heptahedral silsesquioxane. In {{the first step}} CF3SO3H acid attacks siloxane Si-O-Si bonds {{and the formation of}} Si-O-SO2CF3 bond parallel with cage opening process is observed and compound B is obtained (Figure below). Such an inversion is observed at silicon atom during nucleophilic displacement reaction that is usually noticed when leaving groups are replaced by soft nucleophiles. Uponfurther acid attack, both T6(OH)4 C and siloxane dimer D are formed. Because this reaction takes place in an aqueous conditions, compound E of general formula T8(OH)4 as a consequence of hydrolysis reaction was obtained. E is prone to reaction with Dand due to this, the abstraction of CF3SO anion occurs and the closure frame with the spontaneous cage-rearrangement to heptahedral T10 structure F is observed. Although, heptahedral F is less favorable energetically (MM2 data), in this case its creation is forces by the formation of a new Si4O4 moiety from much more less stable substrates D and E.|$|E
50|$|The partial element {{equivalent}} circuit (PEEC) is a 3D full-wave modeling method suitable for combined electromagnetic and circuit analysis. Unlike MoM, PEEC {{is a full}} spectrum method valid from dc to the maximum frequency determined by the meshing. In the PEEC method, the integral equation is interpreted as Kirchhoff's voltage law applied to a basic PEEC cell which results in a complete circuit solution for 3D geometries. The {{equivalent circuit}} formulation allows for additional SPICE type circuit elements to be easily included. Further, the models and the analysis apply to both {{the time and the}} frequency domains. The circuit equations resulting from the PEEC model are easily constructed using a modified loop analysis (MLA) or modified nodal analysis (MNA) formulation. Besides providing a direct current solution, it has several other advantages over a MoM analysis for this class of problems since any type of circuit element can be included in a straightforward way with appropriate matrix stamps. The PEEC method has recently been extended to include nonorthogonal geometries. This model extension, which is consistent with the classical orthogonal formulation, includes the Manhattan representation of the geometries in addition to the more general quadrilateral and <b>hexahedral</b> elements. This helps in keeping the number of unknowns at a minimum and thus reduces computational time for nonorthogonal geometries.|$|E
50|$|Taenite is the nickel rich end {{member of}} the kamacite-taenite solid solution. Taenite is {{naturally}} occurring on Earth whereas kamacite is only found on Earth when it comes from space. Kamacite forms taenite as it forms and expels nickel to the surrounding area, this area forms taenite. Due to the face centered nature of the kamacite lattice and the body centered nature of the nickel lattice the two make intricate angles {{when they come in}} contact with each other. These angles reveal themselves macroscopically in the Thomson structure. Also due to this relationship we get the terms ataxite, hexahedrites and octahedrite. Ataxite refers to meteorites that do not show a grossly <b>hexahedral</b> or octahedral structure. Meteorites composed of 6 wt% or less nickel are often referred to as hexahedrites due to the crystal structure of kamacite being isometric and causing the meteorite to be cubic. Likewise if the meteorite is dominated by the face centered taenite it is called an octahedrite as kamacite will exsolve from the octahedral crystal boundaries of taenite making the meteorite appear octahedral. Both hexahedrites and octahedrite only appear when the meteorite breaks along crystal planes or when prepared to excentuate the Thomson structures therefore many are mistakenly called ataxites ar first.|$|E
50|$|In {{far more}} complex {{geometries}} it is logical to use large number of blocks and therefore it leads to unstructured grids. These are widely accepted in CFD because this gives us far more flexibility and computer resources are also efficiently utilized. In this case two-dimensional structured mesh uses triangle elements while three-dimensional uses tetrahedral elements.These are combination of small structured mesh arranged in unstructured pattern. In this type of grid each single cell is treated as a block. There is no structure of coordinate lines that is given by the grid. The advantage {{of this type of}} grids is that mesh can be refined wherever needed.This is based on the fact since the control volume can be of any shape therefore restriction on number of adjacent cell is lifted.This uses various combinations of cell shapes. Hybrid grid can also be used. Hybrid grids are those in which mixture of triangular and quadrilateral elements are used to construct grids. In three dimension combination of tetrahedral and <b>hexahedral</b> elements results in hybrid grid. Example of hybrid grid is shown in figure 5.Unstructured grids reduces the time which is required for meshing and mapping. Therefore, grid generation is faster and easy. Various automatic techniques especially those associated with Finite Element Method also utilize unstructured grids. Mesh refinement and adaption is easy in unstructured grids.|$|E
40|$|For {{finite element}} {{analyses}} within highly elastic and plastic structural domains, <b>hexahedral</b> meshes have historically offered some benefits over tetrahedral finite element meshes {{in terms of}} reduced error, smaller element counts, and improved reliability. However, <b>hexahedral</b> finite element mesh generation continues {{to be difficult to}} perform and automate, with <b>hexahedral</b> mesh generation taking several orders of magnitude longer than current tetrahedral mesh generators to complete. Thus, developing {{a better understanding of the}} underlying constraints that make <b>hexahedral</b> meshing difficult could result in dramatic reductions in the amount of time necessary to prepare a <b>hexahedral</b> finite element model for analysis. In this paper, we present a survey of constraints associated with <b>hexahedral</b> meshes (i. e., the conditions that must be satisfied to produce a <b>hexahedral</b> mesh). In presenting our formulation of these constraints, we will utilize the dual of a <b>hexahedral</b> mesh. We also discuss how incorporation of these constraints into existing <b>hexahedral</b> mesh generation algorithms could be utilized to extend the class of geometries to which these algorithms apply. We also describe a list of open problems in <b>hexahedral</b> mesh generation and give some context for future efforts in addressing these problems...|$|E
40|$|A generic {{algorithm}} is proposed to merge structured and unstructured <b>hexahedral</b> meshes automatically into one single valid finite element mesh of <b>hexahedral,</b> tetrahedral and pyramid elements. In view {{of the success of}} merging arbitrary tetrahedral meshes in addressing the industrial need for rapid modification, update and manipulation of meshed objects, the merging algorithm is extended to <b>hexahedral</b> meshes by first dividing each <b>hexahedral</b> element into five or six tetrahedral elements. Non-intersected <b>hexahedral</b> elements can be easily recovered from the merged tetrahedral mesh as the constituent tetrahedra as a subdivision of the original <b>hexahedral</b> elements are intact and present in the mesh. Like the merging of tetrahedral meshes, the procedure is robust and efficient as all operations such as loops of intersection, incorporation of intersection segments, partition of boundary surfaces and identification of regions of intersection are deterministic and topological. The mesh merging algorithm provides a means to combine, modify and insert new features to existing <b>hexahedral</b> and tetrahedral meshes. It is also a powerful tool to create new meshes from existing <b>hexahedral</b> and tetrahedral meshes through the Boolean operations. High-quality regular <b>hexahedral</b> elements of the original mesh generated by mapping or extrusion will be preserved, which is important for finite element analysis as <b>hexahedral</b> elements are sensitive to shape distortions. Examples with details for each step of the mesh merging process are presented to elucidate the main ideas of the algorithm. © 2012 Elsevier B. V.
