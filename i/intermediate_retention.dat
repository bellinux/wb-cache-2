40|$|The {{gene for}} von Recklinghausen {{neurofibromatosis}} type 1 (NF 1) was recently identified by positional cloning and found to encode a protein with sequence similarity to a family of eucaryotic GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Expression of the NF 1 -GAP-related domain (NF 1 GRD) {{has been shown to}} complement yeast strains deficient in the yeast GAP homologs, IRA 1 and IRA 2, to interact with human RAS proteins and to accelerate the conversion of ras-GTP to ras-GDP. Further analysis of this region has revealed a number of residues that are highly conserved between members of the GAP family. Mutational analysis of a representative number of these residues produced one of three effects: (1) no change in NF 1 GRD function.

This study explores the basis for this arrest and describes consequent alterations in the size and rate of secretion of the complex endoglycosidase H-resistant form of the protein. Inhibition of glucosidase I and II with castanospermine or alpha- 1, 2 -mannosidase with 1 -deoxymannojirimycin produced altered ER processing intermediates that were rapidly secreted. Subsequent mobilization of ER Ca 2 + stores resulted in the appearance and retention of slightly larger related forms of these <b>intermediates.</b> <b>Retention</b> of glycosylated <b>intermediates</b> was not ascribable to an association with alpha 1, 2 -mannosidase or lectin-like chaperones, the intermediates were not degraded and all evidence of ER retention or size alterations produced by Ca 2 + depletion was quickly reversed by Ca 2 + restoration.

To improve the separation performances of the isocratic separations an ACN gradient elution optimization was carried out for each column. The most satisfactory results were obtained using a Purospher column which allowed the separation of 19 STER in an analysis time close to 26 min. After sample preparation using SPE, method validation was performed in an AFWS spiked with STER according to the EC decision criteria established for quantitative screening methods. For this purpose calibration graphs, extraction efficiencies, decision limits, detection capabilities, precision (repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility), accuracy, selectivity, and robustness were evaluated.

Some researcher have reported the aerobic biological treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater (Lapara et al. (2001). Khan and Mostafa (2011) studied the aerobic treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater in a biological reactor. A laboratory-scale batch type of integrated aerobic biological treatment plant was constructed and operated for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment and its performance was evaluated. A cylindrical open tank was used as a reactor and air was passed through the bottom of the tank. In this study, the maximum hydraulic retention time (HRT) was 15  days. They collected the treated water samples every day and tested it for the following parameters: COD, TSS, pH, conductivity and TDS to evaluate the efficiency of the plant. About 75  % removal of COD was achieved employing HRT of 15  days. The analyses of the treated wastewater reveal that the parameters pH, BOD, COD, TSS, TDS and colour were found within the prescribed permissible limits, indicating the efficiency of the plant. They concluded that air injection accelerates the biological treatment process, with the greatest influence on COD removal from the wastewater.

We have estimated here the gene content of Bartonella koehlerae, a novel species isolated from cats that was recently identified as an agent of human endocarditis. The investigation was accomplished by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to a microarray constructed from the sequenced 1. 93 -Mb genome of B. henselae. Control hybridizations of labeled DNA from the human pathogen Bartonella quintana with a reduced genome of 1. 58 Mb were performed to evaluate the accuracy of the array for genes with known levels of sequence divergence. Genome size estimates of B. koehlerae by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis matched that calculated by the CGH, indicating a genome of 1. 7 to 1. 8 Mb with few unique genes. As in B. quintana, sequences in the prophage and the genomic islands were reported absent in B. koehlerae. In addition, sequence variability was recorded in the chromosome II-like region, where B. koehlerae showed an <b>intermediate</b> <b>retention</b> pattern of both coding and noncoding sequences. Although most of the genes missing in B. koehlerae are also absent from B. quintana, its phylogenetic placement near B. henselae suggests independent deletion events, indicating that host specificity is not solely attributed to genes in the genomic islands.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} long-term retention, {{percentage of}} patients withdrawing because of adverse events, percentage of patients achieving seizure freedom, safety {{profile of the}} new anti-epileptic drugs lamotrigine, levetiracetam and topiramate. METHODS: All patients treated with lamotrigine, levetiracetam or topiramate in the Epilepsy Centre were identified. Each drug was analyzed from introduction of the drug in the Netherlands up to a final assessment point 2 years later. RESULTS: Data from 1066 patients were included: 336 for lamotrigine, 301 for levetiracetam, 429 for topiramate. Two-year retention rates were 69. 2 % (lamotrigine), 45. 8 % (levetiracetam), 38. 3 % (topiramate); (LTG vs. LEV at p< 0. 001; LTG vs. TPM at p< 0. 001; LEV vs. TPM at p= 0. 005). Seizure freedom rates were lowest for lamotrigine and highest for levetiracetam. Adverse events {{played a role in}} drug discontinuation in 154 / 429 patients (35. 9 %) on topiramate, 52 / 336 patients (15. 5 %) on lamotrigine (p< 0. 001), 68 / 301 patients (22. 5 %) on levetiracetam (p< 0. 001). Mood and general CNS-effects are common in patients on lamotrigine and levetiracetam, and neurocognitive side effects are most prevalent in patients on topiramate. A positive effect on cognition is frequently noted in patients on lamotrigine. CONCLUSION: A drug that is only modestly efficacious but has a favourable safety profile may look better than a drug that is more efficacious but produces clinically meaningful adverse events. Therefore, a drug's retention rate is mainly determined by its side effect profile. As a consequence, retention rate was highest for lamotrigine and lowest for topiramate. <b>Intermediate</b> <b>retention</b> rates were seen with levetiracetam use...|$|E

This article has been made available through the Brunel Open Access Publishing Fund. The measurement of γ-H 2 AX foci induction in cells provides a sensitive and reliable method for the quantitation of DNA damage responses {{in a variety of}} cell types. Accurate and rapid methods to conduct such observations are desirable. In this study we have employed the novel technique of multispectral imaging flow cytometry to compare the induction and repair of γ-H 2 AX foci in three human cell types with different capacities for the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSB). A repair normal fibroblast cell line MRC 5 -SV 1, a DSB repair defective ataxia telangiectasia (AT 5 BIVA) cell line, and a DNA-PKcs deficient cell line XP 14 BRneo 17 were exposed to 2 Gy gamma radiation from a 60 Cobalt source. Thirty minutes following exposure we observed a dramatic induction of foci in the nuclei of these cells. After 24 hrs there was a predictable reduction on the number of foci in the MRC 5 -SV 1 cells, consistent with the repair of DNA DSB. In the AT 5 BIVA cells, persistence of the foci over a 24 hour period was due to the failure in the repair of DNA DSB. However, in the DNA-PKcs defective cells (XP 14 BRneo 17) we observed an <b>intermediate</b> <b>retention</b> of foci in the nuclei indicative of partial repair of DNA DSB. In summary, the application of imaging flow cytometry has permitted an evaluation of foci in a large number of cells (20, 000) for each cell line at each time point. This provides a novel method to determine differences in repair kinetics between different cell types. We propose that imaging flow cytometry provides an alternative platform for accurate automated high through-put analysis of foci induction in a variety of cell types.

40|$|Mining-Influenced Water (MIW) poses major {{environmental}} issues in New Zealand and worldwide {{due to a}} legacy of unmitigated mining activities. As conventional MIW treatment technologies can be very costly in terms of chemical and energy inputs, cheaper and environmentally-friendly alternative remediation strategies have been developed. These so-called passive treatment technologies include a range of engineered systems relying on biogeochemical processes able to mitigate the acidity and to immobilize the metals in MIW. The present research, built on previous work conducted at the University of Canterbury, investigated the use of waste materials in mesocosm lab-scale sulfate-reducing bioreactors (SRBR) to treat actual mining-influenced water (MIW) sourced at an active coal mine in New Zealand. Specifically, this study investigated using waste mussel shells as an alkaline amendment (instead of the more conventional material limestone), with organic waste materials such as wood byproducts and compost in complex substrate mixtures in upward-flow SRBR. The influence of hydraulic retention times of approximately 3 and 10 days (HRT; i. e. the contact time between the MIW and the substrate mixtures in the SRBR) on the treatment performances was also evaluated. Overall, each system successfully treated the MIW (e. g. increased the pH > 6 and removed > 78 % of the metals, except Mn) during the first 5 -month treatment period, while during the second 5 -month period, the treatment systems containing limestone and/or operating at a short HRT started {{to show signs of}} decreased efficiency. Generally, the system containing mussel shell and operating at a long HRT was constantly the most efficient system. Over the whole 41 -week period of treatment, key metal removal efficiencies ranged between 97. 6 and 99. 7 % (Al), 83. 9 and 95. 2 % (Fe), and 9. 2 and 38. 8 % (Mn). Sulfate removal, in terms of moles of sulfate removed per cubic meter of substrate per day, was on average below the design values of 0. 3 mol/m 3 /d, and ranged between 0. 03 and 0. 55 mol/m 3 /d (median values were 0. 26 to 0. 3 mol/m 3 /d during the first 5 -month period but dropped to 0. 094 to 0. 1 mol/m 3 /d during the second 5 -month treatment period). The SRBR containing mussel shell instead of limestone resulted in significantly higher alkalinity generation (between 32 to 85 % higher) and higher metal removals (between 0. 6 % higher for Al and 14 % higher for Ni). These results were mainly attributed to the unique mineralogy of the mussel shell which comprises of aragonite with traces of calcite, while limestone comprises of pure calcite with traces of quartz. The statistical analyses showed that the sulfate reduction was not significantly affected by the alkalinity source. Similarly, systems operating at a longer HRT (10 days instead of 3 days) showed better treatment performances than systems operating at a short HRT in terms of alkalinity generation (44 to 62 % higher), metal removal (between 0. 5 % higher for Al to 15 % higher for Ni, and between 17 to 23 % higher for Mn), and sulfate reduction (50 to 77 % higher). Overall, the systems operation on a longer HRT were dominated by a more reduced environment facilitating the precipitation of metal sulfides, while the reactors running on a shorter HRT were constantly maintained out of equilibrium by the continuous addition of fresh MIW. Chemical and mineralogical analyses performed on the spent substrates suggested that the metals were removed through precipitation as, and adsorption onto, metal sulfides (Fe, Zn, Ni, Cu), (oxy) hydroxides (Al, Fe, Zn), and carbonates (Mn, Zn). Mn, a metal known to be harder to remove from solution was likely removed through the precipitation of rhodochrosite (MnCO 3) and via adsorption onto the organic matter. These results generally corroborated the results obtained using the geochemical modeling PHREEQC. Overall, this study showed that mussel shells are not only a sustainable and effective alternative to mined limestone, but their use in SRBR would also result in a better treatment of MIW. Additionally, even though an increase in HRT resulted in a better contaminant removal, a HRT of approximately 3 days was sufficient to remove about 80 % of all metals (except Mn). Therefore, the difficult choice of an optimal HRT must balance the need to meet a specific effluent quality while keeping the treatment time reasonably short, and an <b>intermediate</b> <b>retention</b> time of approximately 6 days could be optimal...|$|E

But do internalized models modify movements only in {{the context in which}} they were learned or do they generalize across contexts? There exists some disagreement in the literature over this idea, possibly due to the different paradigms used in these experiments. To examine the effects different testing contexts exert on motor learning, participants performed a point-to-point reaching task while grasping a robot manipulandum that applies a force perturbation of 4. 0 N·m/s. Single null field catch trials were interspersed throughout the task, during which participants moved the handle of a grasped manipulandum to a visual target, moved the detached handle of the manipulandum, or reached in free space. Participants who reached in free space exhibited minimal aftereffects, while participants who reached with the attached handle experienced the maximum aftereffects. Those who reached with the detached handle experienced intermediate aftereffects, although not significantly different from free space reaching. Upon return to the manipulandum, participants who reached in free space did not retain memory of the force, while those who reached with the detached handle did. Reaching with the attached handle led to <b>intermediate</b> reduction in <b>retention,</b> although not significantly different than free or detached handle. These results show that subtle changes to the testing environment can have a dramatic effect on a learned motor adaptation, which suggests that motor learning results in temporary adaptations to object dynamics rather than the retention of finite models...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a {{comparison}} between the chemical composition of the particulate-phase of exhaled smoke and that of smoke generated with a smoking machine has been performed. For this purpose, eight human subjects smoked a common Lights (10. 6 mg ‘tar’/cig) commercial cigarette and the exhaled particulate-phase smoke from three cigarettes was collected on Cambridge pads for each smoker. The smoke collection from the human subjects was vacuum assisted. The cigarette butts from the smokers were collected and analyzed for nicotine. The machine smoking was performed with a Borgwaldt RM 20 CSR smoking machine working under conditions recommended by the U. S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The nicotine levels for the cigarette butts from the smokers were used to normalize the level of exhaled smoke condensate {{to that of the}} FTC smoking conditions. The smoke condensates from exhaled smoke as well as that from the machine smoking were analyzed by a gas chromatographic technique with mass spectral peak identification. The retention efficiency for 160 compounds was calculated from the ratio of the compound peak areas in the exhaled smoke (normalized by the corresponding butt nicotine level) vs. the areas of the corresponding peaks from the chromatogram of the smoke generated by the smoking machine. In the calculation of the results, it was assumed that the composition of mainstream smoke remains practically constant at different smoking regimes. All compounds found in the machine-generated smoke were also present in the exhaled smoke, but at different levels. About one third of the compounds were retained more than 66 % by the smoker. Another third of the compounds were retained between 33 % and 66 %, {{and the rest of the}} compounds were retained very little from the mainstream particulate-phase of the cigarette smoke. The compounds retained more than 66 % were in general compounds with lower molecular weight and with higher water solubility, which eluted first from a 5 % phenyl dimethyl-polysiloxane (DB- 5 MS) chromatographic column. The compounds retained less than 33 % from smoke were those with higher molecular weights and boiling points, which had longer elution times from the chromatographic column. These compounds consisted mainly of long-chain hydrocarbons (saturated or squalene type) and phytosterol-type compounds. The compounds retained between 33 % and 66 % had <b>intermediate</b> chromatographic <b>retention</b> times. No attempt was made to evaluate or identify new compounds formed in the exhaled smoke.

To serve as an early biomarker in AD the amyloid PET tracers need to be analysed in multicentre clinical studies. METHODS: In this study 238 [(11) C]Pittsburgh compound-B (PIB) datasets from five different European centres were pooled. Of these 238 datasets, 18 were excluded, leaving [(11) C]PIB datasets from 97 patients with clinically diagnosed AD (mean age 69 [*]±[*] 8  years), 72 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; mean age 67. 5 [*]±[*] 8  years) and 51 healthy controls (mean age 67. 4 [*]±[*] 6  years) available for analysis. Of the MCI patients, 64 were longitudinally followed for 28 [*]±[*] 15  months. Most participants (175 out of 220) were also tested for apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype. RESULTS: [(11) C]PIB retention in the neocortical and subcortical brain regions was significantly higher in AD patients than in age-matched controls. <b>Intermediate</b> [(11) C]PIB <b>retention</b> was observed in MCI patients, with a bimodal distribution (64  % MCI PIB-positive and 36  % MCI PIB-negative), which was significantly different the pattern in both the AD patients and controls. Higher [(11) C]PIB retention was observed in MCI ApoE ε 4 carriers compared to non-ApoE ε 4 carriers (p[*]<[*] 0. 005). Of the MCI PIB-positive patients, 67  % had converted to AD at follow-up while none of the MCI PIB-negative patients converted. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the robustness of [(11) C]PIB PET as a marker of neocortical fibrillar amyloid deposition in brain when assessed in a multicentre setting. MCI PIB-positive patients showed more severe memory impairment than MCI PIB-negative patients and progressed to AD at an estimated rate of 25  % per year. None of the MCI PIB-negative patients converted to AD, and thus PIB negativity had a 100  % negative predictive value for progression to AD. This supports the notion that PIB-positive scans in MCI patients are an indicator of prodromal AD. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Previous {{investigations}} of the biosynthesis of sterols by the arterial wall {{have shown that the}} intact aorta is capable of low level incorporation of labeled precursor into a sterol digitonide. The biosynthesis of sterols and related lipids by a cell-free preparation of bovine aorta was investigated in the present study. The cell-free system was the 60, 000 x g supernatant of a Waring Blendor homogenate of aorta and 0. 1 M phosphate nicotinamide buffer. When the 60, 000 x g supernatant was incubated in the presence of adenosine triphosphate and mevalonic acid- 2 -C¹⁴, the non-saponifiable fraction (NSF) of the incubation mixture was radioactive. Acetate- 2 -C¹⁴ was not incorporated into the NSF. A sterol digitonide of low specific activity (60 to 237 counts per min per mg cholesterol) could be isolated from the NSF, but the major amount of radioactivity in the NSF was not digitonin precipitable. The 60, 000 x g supernatant was capable of forming phosphomevalonic acid, mevalonic acid pyrophosphate, and isopentenyl pyrophosphate from MVA. Chromatography of the NSF on silicic acid-celite columns showed the labeled material to be slightly less polar than cholesterol. Samples of the labeled material isolated (by preparative layer chromatography) from large amounts of NSF did not give a positive Liebermann-Burchard reaction and did not form a 2, 4 -dinitrophenylhydrazone.

Dipeptides GK, KG, AK, KA, and GR were each selectively tagged with one TMPP-ac {{group at the}} N-terminal amino group while the other charge was introduced by protonation at the lysine or arginine side-chain groups to give (TMPP-ac-peptide + H) 2 + ions by electrospray ionization. Doubly tagged peptide derivatives were also prepared from GK, KG, AK, and KA in which the fixed-charge TMPP-ac groups were attached to the N-terminal and lysine side-chain amino groups to give (TMPP-ac-peptide-ac-TMPP) 2 + dications by electrospray. ECD of (TMPP-ac-peptide + H) 2 + resulted in 72 % to 84 % conversion to singly charged dissociation products while no intact charge-reduced (TMPP-ac-dipeptide + H) +• ions were detected. The dissociations involved loss of H, formation of (TMPP + H) +, and N–C(alpha) bond cleavages giving TMPP-CH 2 CONH 2 + (c 0) and c 1 fragments. In contrast, ECD of (TMPP-ac-peptide-ac-TMPP) 2 + resulted in 31 % to 40 % conversion to dissociation products due to loss of neutral TMPP molecules and 2, 4, 6 -trimethoxyphenyl radicals. No peptide backbone cleavages were observed for the doubly tagged peptide ions. Ab initio and density functional theory calculations for (Ph 3 P-ac-GK + H) 2 + and (H 3 P-ac-GK + H) 2 + analogs indicated that the doubly charged ions contained the lysine side-chain NH 3 + group internally solvated by the COOH group. The distance between the charge-carrying phosphonium and ammonium atoms was calculated to be 13. 1 - 13. 2 Å in the most stable dication conformers. The intrinsic recombination energies of the TMPP+-ac and (GK + H) + moieties, 2. 7 and 3. 15 eV, respectively, indicated that upon electron capture the ground electronic states of the (TMPP-ac-peptide + H) +• ions retained the charge in the TMPP group.

40|$|Although theory {{suggests}} that the real exchange rate should depreciate after a credible trade liberalization but could appreciate temporarily with a noncredible one, little empirical evidence exists. Unlike existing studies that use either indirect tests or unreliable openness measures, this paper uses an event study based on carefully documented trade liberalization in 45 countries. The result shows that real exchange rates depreciate after countries open their economies to trade. In countries with multiple liberalization episodes, however, real exchange rates appreciate during early episodes, suggesting that partial or noncredible trade liberalizations are associated with real appreciation.

40|$|Forest fragmentation, {{modification}} {{and loss}} {{can have a}} range of negative impacts on wildlife, including reduced foraging opportunities, increased competition for resources, loss of habitat connectivity and restricted dispersal, and increased predation risk due to removal of habitat cover. Harvesting practices such as clearfelling (clearcutting) in native forests typically remove all standing mature forest elements, resulting in large tracts of land with little vegetation cover and altered biodiversity. An alternative practice, aggregated retention, was developed with the objectives to ‘lifeboat’ species and processes, retain and enhance structural complexity and improve connectivity within the landscape, by retaining patches of unlogged forest within ‘islands’ and surrounding ‘edges’ in the harvested matrix. Although this practice has been successful in retaining biodiversity and mature forest species for some taxa, there have been relatively few studies on small ground mammals, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere, and very little attention has been given to landscape connectivity. The main aim of this thesis was {{to determine the effects of}} different forestry practices (clearfelling, unlogged native forest and aggregated retention treatments) in wet eucalypt forest in Tasmania on two native rodent species: the swamp rat (Rattus lutreolus), a cover-dependent species, and the long-tailed mouse (Pseudomys higginsi), a habitat generalist. The first part of this project involved a field investigation of rodent abundances, demographics and habitat use (Chapter 2). The distinctly different responses of the two species to each practice, particularly within aggregated retention, then prompted investigations into physiological responses of both species (Chapter 3), and the genetic (Chapter 4) and behavioural (Chapter 5) implications of forestry practices on the cover-dependent swamp rat. A major field study examining rodent abundances (Chapter 2) showed that the cover-dependent swamp rat declined with increasing disturbance among the three treatments, with abundance highest in unlogged forest, lowest in clearfelled and <b>intermediate</b> in aggregated <b>retention.</b> These responses to disturbance were also seen in the different habitat types created within aggregated retention sites, with lowest abundances in the harvested matrix, highest in the forested edges and intermediate in the forested islands. There was also a significant positive relationship between swamp rat abundance and lower strata vegetation cover in harvested areas. In contrast, the abundance of the long-tailed mouse was not significantly different among treatments nor within the different habitat types in aggregated retention sites and there were no clear relationships with vegetation cover. The abundance results indicated that swamp rats were highly sensitive to harvesting while long-tailed mice were resilient and able to persist in harvested areas. Interestingly, the physiological data (blood profiles and body condition, Chapter 3) did not reflect this result, with no indication of stress responses nor differences in general condition in swamp rats, while long-tailed mice showed poorer body condition in clearfelled sites compared to unlogged sites. Long-tailed mice may only inhabit harvested areas out of necessity rather than showing resilience to disturbed habitats. Swamp rats were rarely found in harvested areas and may be minimising physiological impacts by preferentially residing in forested areas. Alternatively, populations may be experiencing elevated physiological stress in both harvested and unlogged sites due to fragmentation of the latter by minor roads. Habitat fragmentation can impede movement of animals between suitable habitat, restricting dispersal and gene flow, and resulting in population differentiation. Analyses of swamp rat genetic samples (Chapter 4) from aggregated retention and unlogged sites revealed no evidence of inbreeding, but increased relatedness in aggregated retention island patches, which is most likely due to restricted dispersal across the ‘hostile’ harvested matrix. Surprisingly, analyses also revealed that swamp rats do not easily move across unpaved, narrow (< 10 m) and seldom-used roads. While harvesting may result in immediate and large-scale changes to suitable habitat, roads may pose a longer-term hindrance to dispersal. Swamp rats prefer dense vegetation cover (Chapter 2), although the importance of ground-level structural cover and overhead visual cover was not clear from the field trial. Therefore, captive behavioural trials (Chapter 5) were run to test habitat cover preferences by swamp rats using ground-level structural cover and 1 m high overhead (visual) cover in low risk (dark) and high risk (light) conditions. There were no clear preferences for different densities of structural or visual cover. However, the walls of the experimental arena (essentially a type of structural cover, perhaps analogous to large logs) were preferred over the centre area of the arena, regardless of cover density or risk conditions for both structural and visual cover types. This thesis highlights the importance of using multiple disciplines (ecology, physiology, genetics, and behaviour) to investigate anthropogenic disturbances on wildlife. Despite persistence within the harvested matrix, long-tailed mice showed decreased body condition, which may have longer-term health and reproductive consequences. Additionally, while swamp rat populations appear to be thriving in unlogged forests, population differentiation is occurring due to the presence of unpaved, narrow, and seldom-used roads acting as dispersal barriers. It also confirmed that the practice of aggregated retention as an alternative to clearfelling is beneficial for small ground-dwelling mammals for the objective of life-boating, but may not be providing landscape connectivity as there are some restrictions for dispersal of cover-dependent species, at least over the short-term...|$|R
