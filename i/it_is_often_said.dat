5|$|Turbines {{offered more}} power than {{reciprocating}} engines for the same volume of machinery. This, along with a guarantee on the new machinery from the inventor, Charles Parsons, persuaded the Royal Navy to use turbines in Dreadnought. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>said</b> that turbines had the additional benefits of being cleaner and more reliable than reciprocating engines. By 1905, new designs of reciprocating engine were available which were cleaner and more reliable than previous models.|$|E
5|$|A few species, the Caribbean fire sponge Tedania ignis, cause {{a severe}} rash in humans who handle them. Turtles and some fish feed mainly on sponges. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>said</b> that sponges produce {{chemical}} defenses against such predators. However an experiment {{showed that there}} is no relationship between the toxicity of chemicals produced by sponges and how they taste to fish, which would diminish the usefulness of chemical defenses as deterrents. Predation by fish may even help to spread sponges by detaching fragments.|$|E
5|$|Holding such {{conservative}} views, Saint-Saëns was out {{of sympathy}} – and out of fashion – with the Parisian musical scene of the early 20th century, fascinated as it was with novelty. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>said</b> that he walked out, scandalised, from the premiere of Vaslav Nijinsky and Igor Stravinsky's ballet The Rite of Spring in 1913. In fact, according to Stravinsky, Saint-Saëns was not present on that occasion, but at the first concert performance of the piece the following year he expressed the firm view that Stravinsky was insane.|$|E

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>said</b> that labels argent are a peculiarly royal symbol, {{and that}} eldest sons outside {{the royal family}} should use labels of a {{different}} colour, usually gules.|$|E
50|$|There was not {{a better}} {{epilepsy}} drug until phenobarbital in 1912. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> <b>said</b> the British Army laced soldiers' tea with bromide to quell sexual arousal—but that is likely untrue as doing so would also diminish alertness in battle and similar stories exist {{about a number of}} substances.|$|R
500|$|Collaborator John Fleming said of {{him that}} [...] "At home, he {{occasionally}} put a live goldfish in his mouth to get attention – I saw him do <b>it</b> twice. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> <b>said</b> of Malcolm, {{with a lot of}} justification, that he never had a stage act – his life was his act." ...|$|R
50|$|By {{the early}} 19th century <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> <b>said</b> to <b>be</b> the most favoured variety for {{cidermaking}} even in England, {{but by the}} end of the century <b>it</b> had <b>been</b> supplanted by newer cultivars and was little known. Irish domestic cider production contracted after the Great Famine and subsequent emigration, and the Coccagee also became rare in its country of origin.|$|R
25|$|The race {{started at}} 6am with {{only four of}} the 12 {{entrants}} on the track. Although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>said</b> that the first six-day was a non-stop, no-sleeping event that ran without pause for six days, in fact riders joined in when they chose and slept as they wished.|$|E
25|$|The Mustaali sects are {{the most}} {{traditional}} of the three main groups of Ismāʿīlī, maintaining rituals such as prayer and fasting more consistently with the practices of other Shi'i sects. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>said</b> that they resemble Sunni Islam even more than Twelvers do, though this would hold true for matters of the exterior rituals (zahir) only, with little bearing on doctrinal or theological differences.|$|E
25|$|Billups and Prince again led the Pistons with steady, unwavering defense, {{which is}} the key, as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>said,</b> to victory. Although Duncan and Ginobili {{finished}} with 21 points each, neither was able to seriously threaten the strong Pistons defense enough to win the game. Detroit thus won its fifth consecutive game facing elimination. The Pistons became the first road team to force a Game 7 in the NBA Finals.|$|E
2500|$|Tata {{had spoken}} to the press of plans to {{properly}} relaunch England's oldest car marque. [...] In July 2008 Tata Group, the current owners of Jaguar and Daimler, announced they were considering transforming Daimler into [...] "a super-luxury marque to compete directly with Bentley and Rolls-Royce". Until the early 1950s <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> <b>said</b> [...] "the aristocracy buy Daimlers, the nouveau riche buy Rolls-Royce".|$|R
5000|$|The area is at {{the east}} end of Glasgow on London Road, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> <b>said</b> that Glasgow Corporation Transport Department invented the name so that curious {{tourists}} and city dwellers would travel there thus increasing revenue. In fact, the terminus (at Braidfauld Street) was directly opposite a group of 19th century cottages, now replaced by 1960s council houses, named [...] "Auchenshuggle Cottages".|$|R
5000|$|For over 65 years, The Daimler Company Limited {{produced}} {{a wide variety}} of premium quality vehicles including very many buses, ambulances, fire engines and some trucks but in particular medium-sized and large cars which <b>were</b> <b>often</b> very expensive. Their vehicles were distinguished by their finned exposed radiators, later by scalloped radiator shells.

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>said</b> that Galileo {{thought the}} curve of a hanging chain was parabolic. In his Two New Sciences (1638), Galileo says that a hanging cord is an {{approximate}} parabola, and he correctly observes that this approximation improves as the curvature gets smaller and is almost exact when the elevation is less than 45°. That the curve followed by a chain is not a parabola was proven by Joachim Jungius (1587–1657); this result was published posthumously in 1669.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, {{analytic}} {{number theory}} is {{a branch of}} number theory that uses methods from mathematical analysis to solve problems about the integers. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>said</b> to have begun with Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet's 1837 introduction of Dirichlet L-functions to give the first proof of Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions. It {{is well known for}} its results on prime numbers (involving the Prime Number Theorem and Riemann zeta function) and additive number theory (such as the Goldbach conjecture and Waring's problem).|$|E
25|$|Jacek Dukaj: one of {{the most}} {{acclaimed}} writers of the 1990s and 2000s, and winner of many awards. He is known for the complexity of his books, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>said</b> that a single short story by Dukaj contains more ideas than many other writers put into their books in their lifetime. His books are generally hard sf; popular themes include the technological singularity, nanotechnology and virtual reality. Among his favourite writers is Australian Greg Egan, and Dukaj's books bear some resemblance to Egan's.|$|E
50|$|Heralded as a {{technological}} marvel, the pill was a trusted product {{of science in}} an increasingly technological age, and was heralded as one of man's 'triumphs' over nature. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> <b>said</b> that with {{the invention of the}} pill, the women who took <b>it</b> had immediately <b>been</b> given a new freedom—the freedom to use their bodies as they saw fit, without having to worry about the burden of unwanted pregnancy.|$|R
25|$|How {{important}} {{the concept was}} can be understood from how the idea that some local phenomenon may be somehow linked to an absolute and sacred object found extensive application in the medieval and early modern periods. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> <b>said</b> that temple lands in Japan were local emanations of Buddhist paradises or that an artisan's work was one with the sacred actions of an Indian Buddha, such as Nevin Koshy.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> <b>said</b> {{that when}} he walked in his convent's garden the birds would come and sing to him, but would stop at once when he stopped to reflect. On one {{occasion}} a porter was sent to his room to fetch him, and the man saw a bright light under a door. He peeked in to see a child shining with light holding a book that Scammacca was reading from.|$|R
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>said</b> that {{twelve years}} elapsed between {{the second and}} third acts of Siegfried, but this is an exaggeration. While it is true that eleven years and twenty-nine weeks passed between the {{completion}} of the developed draft of Act II {{and the beginning of the}} preliminary draft of Act III, Wagner devoted more than a year of this so-called hiatus to the composition of Siegfried, completing the fair copy of Act I, drawing up both the full score and fair copy of Act II, and making sketches for Act III.|$|E
25|$|In {{the modern}} {{microscopic}} interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics, entropy {{is the amount}} of additional information needed to specify the exact physical state of a system, given its thermodynamic specification. Understanding the role of thermodynamic entropy in various processes requires an understanding of how and why that information changes as the system evolves from its initial to its final state. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>said</b> that entropy is an expression of the disorder, or randomness of a system, or of our lack of information about it. The second law is now often seen as an expression of the fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics through the modern definition of entropy.|$|E
25|$|De Divina Proportione, a three-volume work by Luca Pacioli, was {{published}} in 1509. Pacioli, a Franciscan friar, was known mostly as a mathematician, {{but he was also}} trained and keenly interested in art. De Divina Proportione explored the mathematics of the golden ratio. Though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>said</b> that Pacioli advocated the golden ratio's application to yield pleasing, harmonious proportions, Livio points out that the interpretation has been traced to an error in 1799, and that Pacioli actually advocated the Vitruvian system of rational proportions. Pacioli also saw Catholic religious significance in the ratio, which led to his work's title. De Divina Proportione contains illustrations of regular solids by Leonardo da Vinci, Pacioli's longtime friend and collaborator; these are not directly linked to the golden ratio.|$|E

50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> <b>said</b> {{that even}} Himmler feared him, as Kaltenbrunner was an intimidating figure with his 1.94 m height, facial scars and {{volatile}} temper. Kaltenbrunner was also long-time friends with Otto Skorzeny and recommended him for many secret missions, allowing Skorzeny {{to become one}} of Hitler's valued agents. Kaltenbrunner was also responsible for heading Operation Long Jump, the attempt to assassinate Stalin, Churchill, and Roosevelt. This mission was thwarted by Soviet intelligence agent Gevork Vartanian.|$|R
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>said</b> {{that the}} male (usually {{significantly}} smaller than the female, down to 1% of her size as seen in Tidarren sisyphoides) {{is likely to be}} killed by the female after the coupling, or sometimes even before intercourse has been initiated. This supposed propensity is what gave the black widow spider, Latrodectus mactans, its name. However, the three species of North American black widows do not usually kill the male (although they have been known to do so). Males can sometimes even live in the web of a female for a while without being harmed in any way. The male Australian redback spider Latrodectus hasselti is killed by the female after he inserts his second palpus in the female genital opening; in over 60% of cases the female then eats the male.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>said,</b> that Roope {{was at the}} non-striking {{end when}} both John Edrich, and later Geoff Boycott, reached their 100th centuries in {{first-class}} cricket in 1977. Although the second is certainly correct, achieved at 5.49pm {{on the first day}} of the fourth Ashes Test at Headingley on 11 August, when Roope had to take evasive action to avoid a straight-hit four off the bowling of Greg Chappell to bring up Boycott's century, a close inspection of the record books indicates that Roope had swapped batting positions with Geoff Howarth, for the match against Derbyshire at The Oval on 12 July, and Howarth was at the crease when Edrich scored the necessary runs off the bowling of Alan Hill, shortly after play should have ended at 5:30pm on the third and final day.|$|E
25|$|Composition of isometries mixes kinds in {{assorted}} ways. We {{can think}} of the identity as either two mirrors or none; either way, it has no effect in composition. And two reflections give either a translation or a rotation, or the identity (which is both, in a trivial way). Reflection composed with either of these could cancel down to a single reflection; otherwise it gives the only available three-mirror isometry, a glide reflection. A pair of translations always reduces to a single translation; so the challenging cases involve rotations. We know a rotation composed with either a rotation or a translation must produce an even isometry. Composition with translation produces another rotation (by the same amount, with shifted fixed point), but composition with rotation can yield either translation or rotation. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>said</b> that composition of two rotations produces a rotation, and Euler proved a theorem to that effect in 3D; however, this is only true for rotations sharing a fixed point.|$|E
