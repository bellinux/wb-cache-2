40|$|Soil {{mulching}} is {{a sensible}} strategy to reduce evaporation, accelerate crop development, reduce erosion and assist in weed control, but its efficiency for soil salinity control {{is not as}} well documented. The benefits of inorganic (plastic) and organic (grapevine pruning residues) mulching for soil salinity and sodicity control were quantified in a grapevine orchard (cultivars ‘Autumn’ Royal and ‘Crimson’) drip-irrigated with moderately saline waters. Soil samples were taken {{at the beginning and}} end of the 2008 and 2009 <b>irrigation</b> <b>seasons</b> in six vines of each cultivar and mulching treatment. Soil saturation extract electrical conductivity (ECe), chloride (Cle) and sodium adsorption ratio (SARe) values increased in all treatments of both grapevines along the <b>irrigation</b> <b>seasons,</b> but the increases were much lower in the mulched than in the bare soils due to reduced evaporation losses and concomitant decreases in salt evapo-concentration. The absolute salinity and sodicity daily increases in ‘Autumn’ and ‘Crimson’ 2008 and in ‘Crimson’ 2009 were on the average 44 % lower in the plastic and 76 % lower in the organic mulched soils than in the bare soil. The greater efficiency of the organic than the plastic mulch in ‘Crimson’ 2009 was attributed to the leaching of salts by a precipitation of 104 mm that infiltrated the organic mulch but was intercepted by the plastic mulch. Although further work is needed to substantiate these results, the conclusion is that the plastic mulch and, particularly, the organic mulch were more efficient than the bare soil for soil salinity and sodicity control...|$|R
40|$|Deficit {{irrigation}} strategies save water, but {{may enhance}} soil salinization and sodification when irrigated with low-quality waters. The objectives of this five-year study {{performed in the}} middle Ebro Basin (Spain) were to quantify these processes and assess their potential deleterious impact on the response of peach trees subjected to full irrigation (FULL), sustained deficit irrigation (SDI, irrigated at 62. 5 % of FULL) and regulated deficit irrigation (RDI, irrigated at 50 % of FULL in Stage II of fruit development). In relation to FULL, water savings were 40 % in SDI and 9 % in RDI. Soil salinity (ECe), chloride concentration (Cle) and sodicity (SARe) measured in the saturation extract of 480 soil samples generally increased in the <b>irrigation</b> <b>seasons,</b> particularly in the more severe deficit irrigation strategy (SDI). These increases were counteracted by the leaching of salts induced by high leaching fractions (LF) and low water deficits (WD) attained during the non <b>irrigation</b> <b>seasons.</b> The changes in ECe, Cle and SARe measured between sampling dates were significantly correlated (p < 0. 01) with WD and LF calculated for the periods between sampling dates. These parameters were therefore suitable to estimate the required irrigation depths for soil salinity and sodicity control. Peach trees were unaffected by the irrigation treatments, but yield productivity tended to decline above a threshold ECe of 4 dS m− 1.

40|$|Fruit {{production}} {{development is}} resulting in large commercial orchards with improved water management standards. While the agronomic and {{economic benefits of}} regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) have long been established, the local variability in soils and climate and the irrigation system design limits its practical applications. This paper uses a case study approach (a 225 ha stone fruit orchard) to unveil limitations derived from environmental spatial variability and irrigation performance. The spatial variability of soil physical parameters and meteorology in the orchard was characterized, and its implication on crop water requirements was established. Irrigation depths applied during 2004 - 2009 were analysed and compared with crop water requirements under standard and RDI strategies.

During the study <b>seasons,</b> <b>irrigation</b> scheduling evolved towards deficit irrigation; however, the specific traits of RDI in stone fruits were not implemented.

Drainage represented 17 % of total applied irrigation water (measured leached fraction) and is considered necessary to minimize the risk of soil salinization in semiarid environments. The most common ions in the drainage waters were magnesium, sulphate, and calcium and others related with dissolved soil minerals present in the area.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Recent {{research}} efforts {{have shown that}} soil erosion decreases soil productivity. Erosion-caused crop production decreases of 15 - 40 % are commonly reported with some values over 50 %. Furrow erosion on irrigated land in Idaho decreases topsoil depth on the upslope approximately 33 % of the field area and may increase topsoil depth on the downslope 50 - 55 %. Crop yields arc generally decreased where topsoil depths are decreased, but yields are not generally increased where topsoil depths are increased beyond a critical depth. Crops vary in their sensitivity to decreases in topsoil depth, but all crops studied exhibited lower yields on the eroded areas. Soil productivity potential of one area representing several million ha of furrow irrigated land was reduced at least 25 % by furrow erosion over 80 <b>irrigation</b> <b>seasons.</b> Technology is not available to restore soil productivity potential to the level that would exist had there been no erosion except for returning topsoil to eroded areas.

50|$|Proposals {{to build}} a dam on the Meander River below Warners Creek date back to at least 1968. The site was cleared in {{preparation}} for dam construction during the last 1980s. In 1995 a report by engineering consultants, GHD Group, stated {{that the lack of}} a reliable water supply for irrigation in the Meander Catchment is seen as a key factor limiting potential future expansion of agricultural enterprises. The pressure on water resources in the Meander Catchment resulted in the need to limit and sometimes prohibit the extraction of water from the river during the <b>irrigation</b> <b>season.</b> In 2002, a water management plan for the catchment was under development and was expected to address environmental flow concerns through the implementation of higher minimum river flows.

Downstream juvenile fish were impinged on and entrained through the screens over the dam's diversion and pump-turbine systems. There was increased predation of young fish in the seasonal reservoir pool created by the dam and after juveniles pass through the dam's bypass systems.

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a game theoretic model of groundwater extraction in a two-cell aquifer under incomplete information.

We find that the lack of information may either increase or decrease the rate of water use and welfare. In a two-period framework, the relevant characteristic is the ratio of the periodic marginal benefits of water use. Depending on whether this ratio is convex or concave, the average speed with which the aquifer is depleted decreases or increases when users learn more about the local hydrologic properties of groundwater.
