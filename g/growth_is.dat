40|$|Gas hydrate <b>growth</b> pattern <b>is</b> {{of great}} {{importance}} in hydrate-based gas storage and transportation. In this work, direction controlled methane hydrate growth {{in the presence of}} sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was achieved through hydrophobic modification to the hydrate growth surface and design to the existing manner of the reaction solution in the reactor.

Downward hydrate <b>growth</b> <b>was</b> accomplished by fixing the reaction solution in the middle part of the reactor, because both gravity and capillary effect promoted the downward hydrate growth.

5|$|Bacterial growth follows four phases. When a {{population}} of bacteria first enter a high-nutrient environment that allows growth, the cells need to adapt to their new environment. The first phase of <b>growth</b> <b>is</b> the lag phase, a period of slow growth when the cells are adapting to the high-nutrient environment and preparing for fast growth. The lag phase has high biosynthesis rates, as proteins necessary for rapid growth are produced. The second phase of <b>growth</b> <b>is</b> the log phase, {{also known as the}} logarithmic or exponential phase. The log phase is marked by rapid exponential growth. The rate at which cells grow during this phase is known as the growth rate (k), and the time it takes the cells to double is known as the generation time (g). During log phase, nutrients are metabolised at maximum speed until one of the nutrients is depleted and starts limiting growth. The third phase of <b>growth</b> <b>is</b> the stationary phase and is caused by depleted nutrients. The cells reduce their metabolic activity and consume non-essential cellular proteins. The stationary phase is a transition from rapid growth to a stress response state and there is increased expression of genes involved in DNA repair, antioxidant metabolism and nutrient transport. The final phase is the death phase where the bacteria run out of nutrients and die.|$|E
5|$|Because Clumber Spaniels {{are large}} boned and fast growing, they can suffer from {{temporary}} lameness from between six and twelve months of age, with this lameness subsiding when bone <b>growth</b> <b>is</b> complete. Another common condition that the breed suffers from are impacted anal sacs {{and the dog}} may require them to be emptied by a veterinarian. The final common condition that the breed has is heat sensitivity: if Clumber Spaniels are left without shade, they can become uncomfortably hot and dehydrated.|$|E

5|$|Palladium is a metal {{with low}} toxicity. It is poorly absorbed by human body when digested. Plants {{such as the}} water {{hyacinth}} are killed by low levels of palladium salts, but most other plants tolerate it, although tests show that, at levels above 0.0003%, <b>growth</b> <b>is</b> affected. High doses of palladium could be poisonous; tests on rodents suggest it may be carcinogenic, though no clear evidence indicates the element harms humans.|$|E
5|$|Primary <b>growth</b> <b>is</b> the {{elongation}} of {{the stems}} and roots.

40|$|The {{effect of}} pH on the {{instantaneous}} growth of soil bacterial communities was studied in five soils with different pH (4. 5 - 7. 8) using leucine (Leu) and thymidine (TdR) incorporation. The pH dependency of bacterial <b>growth</b> <b>was</b> modelled using three different unimodal functions, and the pH(opt) {{for growth and}} the pH range in which <b>growth</b> <b>was</b> > 50 % of the optimal <b>growth</b> <b>were</b> compared.

Bacterial <b>growth</b> <b>was</b> highly influenced by pH, showing optimum growth at a pH related to the soil pH.

5|$|The {{summit of}} Mauna Kea lies above the tree line, and {{consists}} of mostly lava rock and alpine tundra. An area of heavy snowfall, it is inhospitable to vegetation, and {{is known as the}} Hawaiian tropical high shrublands. <b>Growth</b> <b>is</b> restricted here by extremely cold temperatures, a short growing season, low rainfall, and snow during winter months.

5|$|Thompson {{points out}} that all changes of form are {{phenomena}} of growth.

30|$|The {{slope of}} the {{bacterial}} growth curve continuously decreased with increasing nanoparticle concentration.

It was also clear from the graphs that the bacterial <b>growth</b> <b>was</b> dependent on the initial number of cells present in the medium. It was observed that at lower initial OD, the AgNP concentration necessary to completely inhibit bacterial <b>growth</b> <b>was</b> also low. So silver nanoparticles produced by us will be suitable for preventing bacterial contamination.|$|R
