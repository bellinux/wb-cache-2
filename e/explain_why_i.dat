500|$|Initially, Drummond was unrepentant, telling The Observer in 2000 that he couldn't imagine ever feeling regret unless {{his child}} was ill and only [...] "an {{expensive}} clinic" [...] could cure him. [...] By 2004, however, he had {{admitted to the}} BBC the difficulty of explaining his decision. [...] "It's a hard one to explain to your kids and it doesn't get any easier.

500|$|Although he was {{permitted}} by XL to remix I'm New Here, Jamie xx wrote longhand letters to Scott-Heron for his approval {{to rework the}} other vocal material: [...] "Originally, I sent him the album {{and there were a}} couple of tracks he wasn't sure about. I had to write to him—he does handwritten letters, not e-mail—and <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> wanted to use some of his older vocal tracks on the album ... So after I wrote him the letter, he said I was free to do whatever because he knew what I was doing". Scott-Heron was credited as a producer for the album, along with Russell and Malcolm Cecil, a producer and engineer on Scott-Heron's past work. The original vocals had been produced and engineered at Clinton Studios and Looking Glass Studios in New York. We're New Here was mixed at London's XL Studio, where additional recording also took place.|$|E
500|$|According to Icelandic legend, the Lodsilungur is a furry trout {{that is the}} {{creation}} of demons and giants. The Lodsilungur are described as inedible fish that overwhelm rivers and are a form of punishment for human wickedness. In 1900, The Scottish Review featured an account of the Lodsilungur as a poisonous [...] "Shaggy trout" [...] of northern Iceland. In 1854, a shaggy trout was [...] "cast on shore at Svina-vatn" [...] and featured in an 1855 illustration in Nordri, a newspaper. It was described as having a reddish hair on its lower jaw and neck, sides and fins, but the writer of the Nordri article did not specifically identify it by name. Sjón, a popular Icelandic writer, became obsessed with the folk tale when he was nine. Sjón recounted that if a man were to eat the furry trout he would become pregnant and that his scrotum would have to be cut open to deliver the baby. Sjón noted that the story [...] "might <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> was later propelled towards surrealism." ...|$|E

60|$|April 6.--I {{have written}} to Alva and Lord Elgin, <b>explaining</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> cannot, as they {{encourage}} me to do, take upon me {{the cause of}} the public, and bell-the-cat with the reformers. I think I have done enough for an individual.|$|R

2500|$|Infamy {{followed}} when, on 23 August 1994, the K Foundation burnt {{what remained}} of The KLF's earnings – one million pounds sterling – at a boathouse on the Scottish island of Jura. A film of the event – Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid – was taken on tour, with Drummond and Cauty discussing the incineration {{with members of the}} public after each screening. In 2004 Drummond admitted to the BBC that he now regretted burning the money. [...] "It's a hard one to explain to your kids and it doesn't get any easier. I wish I could <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> did it so people would understand." ...|$|E

30|$|In {{the rest}} of this paper, I will {{overview}} the main conclusions of the review, as set out in the Starting Strong reports, then introduce a more personal perspective, <b>explaining</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> find the review so important.

60|$|Now {{after what}} I {{have been saying}} {{it is very easy}} to <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> would have this idea of human unity put before people's minds {{in the form of a}} World State and not of a League of Nations.|$|E

6000|$|Before {{getting your}} kind note, I {{had written to}} Lehmann, <b>explaining</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> cannot allow myself any social {{pleasure}} while my farewell task is yet unfinished.

40|$|Every epoch, {{as is well}} known, is {{a season}} for humanism, {{because there is no}} epoch which does not take up the theme of man and along with it also the {{problems}} that he lives. Not surprisingly, the literature on the subject is vast and there is no century that passed in the history of mankind without crossing this theme.

60|$|It is {{a little}} {{difficult}} to <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> {{did not come to}} do what was the natural thing for any one in my circumstances to do, and take my world for granted. A certain innate scepticism, I think, explains it and a certain inaptitude for sympathetic assimilation. My father, I believe, was a sceptic; my mother was certainly a hard woman.|$|E
60|$|Well, well, - {{all these}} sorrows are past. My glancing at them {{may not be}} without its use, for it may help in some measure to <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> have all my life been {{attached}} to the inanimate objects that people my chamber, and how I have come to look upon them rather {{in the light of}} old and constant friends, than as mere chairs and tables which a little money could replace at will.|$|E

It is a man I am sorry for, who married my old servant, Bell Ormiston. He was an excellent person in his way, and a capital mason--a great curler.|$|R
