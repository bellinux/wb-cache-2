5|$|Both <b>internal</b> <b>and</b> {{external}} signals {{can lead}} to the induction of apoptosis, or programmed cell death. The resulting deconstruction of cellular components is primarily carried out by specialized proteases known as caspases, but the proteasome also plays important and diverse roles in the apoptotic process. The involvement of the proteasome in this process is indicated by both the increase in protein ubiquitination, and of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes that is observed well in advance of apoptosis. During apoptosis, proteasomes localized to the nucleus have also been observed to translocate to outer membrane blebs characteristic of apoptosis.|$|E
5|$|Despite the police-backed intervention, the {{university}} continued on strike.

Eventually, José Aristodemo Pinotti, a former dean of the School of Medical Sciences generally considered a moderate, was selected by the academic community and accepted by the governor. In the following week, on April 19, 1982, the intervention was lifted, and academic activities resumed normally.|$|E

Trematode infection can be highly debilitating. For example, inflammatory trematode lesions can cause endocarditis and neurological disease.

They found F. obliqua to be most closely related to three species of the arid Northern Territory (F. platypoda, F. subpuberula and F. lilliputiana) and classified it in a new series Obliquae in the subsection Platypodeae. The species had remained a transitional rainforest species while its relatives radiated into dryer regions.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{discussion}} of a review article by [27], published in the Journal of Palaeogeography (2 (1) : 56 – 65), is aimed at illustrating that interpretations of ten ancient examples in China {{and one in the}} central Appalachians (USA) as deep-water deposits of <b>internal</b> waves <b>and</b> <b>internal</b> tides are unsustainable. This critical assessment is based on an in-depth evaluation of oceanographic and sedimentologic data on <b>internal</b> waves <b>and</b> <b>internal</b> tides derived from 332 print and online published works during 1838 –January 2013, which include empirical data on the physical characteristics of modern <b>internal</b> waves <b>and</b> <b>internal</b> tides from 51 regions of the world’s oceans [108]. In addition, core and outcrop descriptions of deep-water strata from 35 case studies worldwide carried out by the author during 1974 – 2011, and a selected number of case studies published by other researchers are evaluated for identifying the sedimentological challenges associated with distinguishing types of bottom-current reworked sands in the ancient sedimentary record. The emerging conclusion is that any interpretation of ancient strata as deposits of <b>internal</b> waves <b>and</b> <b>internal</b> tides is premature...|$|R
