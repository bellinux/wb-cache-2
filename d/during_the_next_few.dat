5|$|A {{weakening}} trend soon occurred, with it weakening to a Category1 hurricane {{early on}} September15.

50|$|During January 2014, after {{surveying}} various climate models, the World Meteorological Organization {{warned that}} there was an enhanced possibility of a weak El Niño event happening <b>during</b> 2014. Over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> months <b>the</b> climate of the Pacific Ocean started to exhibit features that suggested the impending onset of an El Niño event. Over the ocean, these features included: a rapid fall of the sea level in western Micronesia, as well as a large area of enhanced sea surface temperatures that were present at low latitudes near the International Date Line. In the atmosphere these features included persistent westerly winds at equatorial latitudes, which were displaced eastwards towards the Marshall Islands. A large area of atmospheric convection was present at a low latitude near the International Dateline, in association with the development of an unusual amount of early season tropical cyclones near the Marshall Islands. As a result of some of these conditions, an El Niño Watch was issued by the United States Climate Prediction Center (NOAA's CPC) and the International Research Institute for Climate and Society within their March 2014 diagnostic discussion.|$|R

5|$|During the 19th century, Lees Ferry {{served as}} a gateway for the {{expansion}} of white settlement from Utah south into Arizona. Most of the settlers were Mormons, who had been long established in the Utah Valley near present-day Salt Lake City, and were looking for additional land. Although the river at Lee's Ferry is too deep to ford for most of the year, its relatively calm current presented an attractive site for crossing by boat. Jacob Hamblin successfully crossed the river here in 1864, and <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> years the Mormon presence swelled to the scale of a small military outpost (Fort Meeks) in order to defend against Navajo raids.

In spring, the garrison sallied forth, but was again defeated and driven back. In 835, Abu Fihr again raided central Sicily, and defeated the army under a Byzantine patrikios (probably the island's strategos) that opposed him, taking the Byzantine commander's wife and son captive in the process. After his success, Abu Fihr sent Muhammad ibn Salim in a raid against the eastern parts of the island, which reached as far as Taormina. However, dissensions broke out once again among the Muslims: Abu Fihr was murdered, and his killers found refuge among the Byzantines.|$|E
5|$|According to al-Tabari, {{the young}} Ibn al-Ash'ath {{accompanied}} {{his father and}} participated in his political activities: in 680 he revealed the hiding-place of Muslim ibn Aqil to the authorities, and he fought in the campaign against al-Mukhtar in which his father was killed, and reportedly executed (or persuaded Mu'sab ibn al-Zubayr to execute) al-Mukhtar's captured followers in revenge. Ibn al-Ash'ath disappears from the record <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> years, but after Mu'sab ibn al-Zubayr was defeated and killed by the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan in October 691, he, like other followers of Mu'sab, apparently {{went over to the}} Umayyads.

Finding himself in an awkward situation because he held no official status in either the Brazilian Imperial House or in the Portuguese Royal House, Pedro assumed the title of Duke of Braganza on 15 June, a position that once had been his as heir to Portugal's crown. Although the title should have belonged to MariaII's heir, which he certainly was not, his claim was met with general recognition.

Ambassadors of France and Spain urged Bernis to insist that the election of the future pope be made to depend on his written engagement to suppress the Jesuits. Bernis refused, answering that demanding from the future pope a written or oral promise to destroy the Society of Jesus would be in violation of the canon law. In spite of this refusal, <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> weeks Bernis consecutively rejected all candidates proposed by Zelanti as too devoted to the Jesuits.
