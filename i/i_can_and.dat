He has the [...] "ability to hold the ball up, and cause the defenders problems" [...] and is in possession of the long throw-in ability. After Rankine signed for Bournemouth, manager Jimmy Quinn said [...] "He's big, he's strong and I'm pleased to get him in". York manager Martin Foyle said Rankine [...] "will also work hard, close down and give us a presence in the final third. He's a good size, mobile and will certainly run the channels." ...|$|E

During his renewal, he said, [...] "I am happy at Juventus and we are competitive. I want to keep playing {{for as long as}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>and</b> I'm certain that for at least two more years I will be at the top level." [...] On 14 February 2010, Del Piero marked his 445th Serie A appearance, breaking the all-time club record previously held by Boniperti, with a brace in a 3–2 win against Genoa.

500|$|Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna {{felt that the}} lyrics, along with being an answer-song, could also be {{interpreted}} as a rebellious one, where Madonna looks back on a relationship where she was not allowed to speak her mind. The song's lyrics contain sarcastic backing vocals with Madonna asking rhetorical questions based on her real-life actions, such as [...] "Did I say something wrong? Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex. I must have been crazy," [...] as well as the line [...] "What was I thinking?" [...] Madonna explained that the lyrics were about [...] "basically saying don't put me in a box, don't pin me down, don't tell me what <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>and</b> can't say. It's about breaking out of the restraints." [...] With the Los Angeles Times she further clarified that there was a defensiveness with the lyrics for [...] "Human Nature": ...|$|E

500|$|Like some of Madonna's {{previous}} music videos, such as [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] and [...] "Like a Prayer", religious imagery plays a {{big role}} in the music video. In the book Madonna's Drowned Worlds the use of Catholic imagery in the video is discussed. Author Santiago Fouz-Hernández points out that unlike Madonna's previous music videos, much of the religious imagery is associated with the torero, not Madonna, {{due to the fact that}} religious images are a strong part of the bullfighting ritual. It has also been argued that in the video Madonna [...] "subverts the gender structure and masculine subjectivity implicit in traditional bullfighting." [...] This is achieved through the [...] "feminization of the matador and the emphasis on Madonna's character" [...] and also through Madonna's [...] "dominant gaze" [...] as she watches the matador perform." [...] Roger Beebe, one of the authors of Medium Cool: Music Videos from Soundies to Cellphones, noted that the video was an example of [...] "how music, image, and lyrics of a song possesses their own temporality". He explained that the [...] "graceful" [...] nature of the song was contrast to the repetitive scenes in the video, which he felt indicated that the protagonist has long been engaging in the activities, including the [...] "demoralizing sex scenes". In Madonna as Postmodern Myth, author Georges-Claude Guilbert felt the video [...] "defied feminists of the Marilyn Frye and Adrienne Rich variety, who see in the video a disgusting example of passé female submissiveness." [...] Madonna responded to this criticism by stating [...] "I don't believe that any organization should dictate to me what <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>and</b> cannot do artistically." [...] Guilbert also noted the usage of religious iconography in the video, especially dubious representation of the Virgin. He explained that most of the times Madonna and the torero make love through the television screen, implying that [...] "one of their purity had to be maintained always".|$|E

2500|$|A {{siege of}} Khartoum by the Mahdist forces {{commanded}} by the Mahdi himself started on 18 March 1884. Initially, {{the siege of}} Khartoum was more in nature a blockade rather than a true siege as the Mahdi's forces lacked the strength to wage a proper siege, for example only cutting the telegraphy lines in April 1884. The British had decided to abandon the Sudan, {{but it was clear}} that Gordon had other plans, and the public increasingly called for a relief expedition.
