50|$|The {{popularity}} {{and availability of}} faster <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>systems</b> such as Ethernet made the use of null modem cables less common. In modern systems, such a cable can still be useful for kernel mode development, since it allows the user to remotely debug a kernel {{with a minimum of}} device drivers and code (a serial driver mainly consists of two FIFO buffers and an interrupt service routine). KGDB for Linux, ddb for BSD, and WinDbg or KD for Windows can be used to remotely debug systems, for example. This can also provide a serial console through which the in-kernel debugger can be dropped to in case of kernel panics, in which case the local monitor and keyboard may not be usable anymore (the GUI reserves those resources and dropping to the debugger {{in the case of a}} panic won't free them).|$|E
50|$|These {{inspections}} {{were originally}} intended to supplement Flag State exam programs, but experience taught that port state inspections were essential to ensuring the safety of vessels engaged in worldwide commerce, especially if these exams were organized on a regional basis. Since ships move cargo from port to port and country to country, it {{was found to be}} to every nation's advantage if inspections could be closely coordinated. To facilitate information exchange, the Coast Guard developed the Maritime Information Exchange and Port State <b>Information</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>systems</b> to share vital safety information with fellow port states and shipping companies. The results of safety inspections and ship specific information are still recorded and made public in these systems. This transparency of information helps to ensure that as many ships as possible are inspected {{while at the same time}} prevents ships from being delayed by unnecessary, redundant inspections. These information systems were developed jointly with the maritime industry to facilitate safe commerce.|$|E

Still maritime transport faces several operations challenges such as non-storability of shipping space, matching supply with dynamic shipping demand, and non-availability of fair allocation mechanism {{in the age of}} <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>systems</b> due to ban of anticompetitive liner conference amongst others. This paper develops a sustainable decision model for allocating ship capacity to satisfy shipping demand and to generate a route plan. The model is referred as sustainable because it determines flexible freight rates and coordinates market players with social interest. The paper uses multi-agent system modeling and an iterative combinatorial auction mechanism with Vickrey–Clarke–Groves payments to deploy ships at economically efficient prices in the age of <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>systems.</b> To tackle the computational complexity of multi-agent system model with auction mechanism, this paper proposes an enumerative search algorithm.

40|$|Abstract. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) {{is a key}} {{technology}} to support interoperability among data and processing resources. Semantic interoperability requires mapping between vocabularies of independently developed resources, a task fraught with uncertainty. Probabilistic ontologies enable representation of knowledge in domains characterized by uncertainty. As such, they promise {{to improve the quality}} of service descriptions, enable more thorough analysis of service composition opportunities, and provide a theoretically sound methodology for semantic mapping under uncertainty. This paper defines probabilistic ontologies, discusses their application to SOA, and presents a conceptual scheme for using a federation of ontologies (with both common and probabilistic ontologies) as a semantic mapping tool for service oriented <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>systems</b> with different levels of service descriptions (including legacy and probabilistic enabled descriptions). 1 Semantic Interoperability in the Semantic Web and Service Oriented Architecture Framework...|$|E

40|$|One way {{to think}} about social-political systems is to {{envision}} each as a set of nested institutions. For Aggarwal's purposes in this volume 2, this opens up two important questions: how does the nesting of institutions take place, and how or when does this resolve conflict. Concerning issue areas, the rationale for thinking about nested institutions is clear. Even “pure ” markets are wound up tightly in many tiers of institutional infrastructure. Property rights systems nest within <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>systems</b> which nest within systems that store and exchange value and so on. For regions the rationale is less obvious. Part of the problem is to agree first off on what it is that constitutes a “region”. Geography is plastic, or at least it is plastic in the way that human minds construct maps.

40|$|We have {{simulated}} {{the effect}} of different parameters in location-aware information sharing policies for crowd-based <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>systems.</b> The purpose of this simulation was {{to find out which}} parameters improved the upload time, battery life and success rate for nodes trying to upload a large file under bad conditions. To test {{the effect of}} these parameters on a larger scale, we simulated an area where a large number of nodes were moving around. Our test results showed that nodes greatly improved their battery life and the upload time by limiting the number of nodes they send data to, rather than sharing data with all nodes within reach. However, sending the oldest collected data performed very bad in regards of battery life time and had a relatively high amount of nodes that did not manage to upload their file. We concluded that nodes should not share their data with all available nodes at all times, and be restrictive in the amount of data they share with other nodes to conserve battery...|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} {{and share the}} major challenges and experiences of building a regional health information exchange system in China {{in the context of}} health reform. Methods. This study used interviews, focus groups, a field study, and a literature review to collect insights and analyze data. The study examined Xinjin’s approach to developing and implementing a health information exchange project, using exchange usage data for analysis. Results. Within three years and after spending approximately $ 2. 4 million (15 million RMB), Xinjin County was able to build a complete, unified, and shared information system and many electronic health record components to integrate and manage health resources for 198 health institutions in its jurisdiction, thus becoming a model of regional health information exchange for facilitating health reform. Discussion. Costs, benefits, experiences, and lessons were discussed, and the unique characteristics of the Xinjin case and a comparison with US cases were analyzed. Conclusion. The Xinjin regional health information exchange system is different from most of the others due to its government-led, government-financed approach.
