25|$|Later, in {{the spring}} of '71, Captain William Meade would bring in a pack train from Hazelton, and he would make many {{improvements}} on that trail. Despite the fact that these roads were built and improved during the rush years, the trip was still perilous and very costly. Steamer fare on the Fraser River on the Enterprise or the Victoria was $25 and 12.5 cents a pound was added <b>for</b> <b>baggage.</b> Smaller boats near the gold fields charged $7 for the ride and 7 cents a pound <b>for</b> <b>baggage.</b> At Takla Landing, yet more money was required, as that was a road toll that charged 18 cents a pound <b>for</b> <b>baggage.</b>|$|E

25|$|One {{version that}} did {{see the light}} of day was the Metro 25, which {{featured}} an increased passenger capacity of 25 at the expense of the baggage space found in earlier models; the deletion of the left rear cargo door, the addition of a passenger door on the right-hand rear fuselage, and a belly pod <b>for</b> <b>baggage.</b> A Metro III was converted as a Metro 25 demonstrator, it flew in this configuration in October 1989. Also mooted but not built was the Metro 25J, which would have been another jet-powered aircraft with TFE731s in over-wing pods.|$|E

500|$|As Amtrak's F40PH fleet was {{replaced}} by newer GE Genesis-series locomotives, Amtrak converted {{a number of the}} retired units into baggage/cab cars. Colloquially known as [...] "cabbages" [...] (a portmanteau of [...] "cab" [...] and [...] "baggage"), and officially known as Non-Powered Control Units (NPCUs), these units had their prime movers and traction motors removed and a large roll-up door installed in the side (allowing the former engine compartment to be used <b>for</b> <b>baggage).</b> Amtrak converted 22 locomotives into cabbage cars between 1996–2007. Each converted unit was renumbered by prefixing [...] "90" [...] to its original number. In 2011, Amtrak F40PH 406 was refurbished for Amtrak's 40th-anniversary exhibit train. It was converted to an NPCU to enable push-pull operation of the exhibit train; in addition a HEP generator was installed to supply auxiliary electricity. Unlike other NPCUs, the 406 retains its original number and resembles an operational F40PH externally.|$|E

2500|$|This branch opened July 1, 1870 from Branchville on {{the main}} line and had one {{terminal}} station at Ridgefield {{as well as two}} flag stops along the way at Florida and Cooper. Trains generally consisted of two cars; one passenger car, plus a combination car <b>for</b> <b>baggage,</b> express and mail. Freight cars were added as needed. Ridgefield had a one-stall engine house and a turntable. The Ridgefield Branch was abandoned by the NYNH in 1964. [...] The branch was later turned into the Ridgefield Rail Trail.|$|E
2500|$|The 1964 [...] "D" [...] model {{brought the}} first {{dramatic}} {{change to the}} 150 – {{the introduction of a}} rear window under the marketing name Omni-Vision.

It also resulted in a larger baggage compartment and a greater structural weight allowance <b>for</b> <b>baggage</b> from 80 to [...] The unswept tailfin from previous years was retained for another two years. Elevator and rudder mass balances were increased to reduce flutter potential caused by the less aerodynamic rear fuselage. The gross weight of the aircraft was also increased in 1964 to , where it would stay until the advent of the Cessna 152. 804 150Ds were built.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{waiting room}} {{on the main floor}} was modeled after an ancient Roman bathhouse, with walls of marble and vaulted ceilings. The {{building}} also housed a large hall adorned with Doric columns that housed the ticket office and arcade shops. Beyond the arcade was the concourse, which had brick walls and a large copper skylight. From here, passengers would walk down a ramp to a tunnel from which the platforms could be accessed by stairs and elevators. [...] Under the shed there were ten passenger platforms consisting of one side platform and five island platforms along ten paired tracks. In addition, one track served the Railway Express Agency (REA) mail service {{at the southern end of}} the shed. Immediately outside the shed were seven additional freight tracks.

2500|$|The S-37 was a two bay {{sesquiplane}} using parallel interplane struts and bracing wires. Based on the S-35 {{its construction}} was very similar, an all metal fuselage and main wing made of Duralumin {{and covered with}} fabric. The empennage featured a triple tail with the rudders placed in the slipstream of each engine and a center vertical stabilizer that was adjustable from a lever in the cockpit. The first S-37 was initially powered by [...] Gnome-Rhône 9A Jupiter engines with the main fuel tanks located in the fairings behind each engine. A small two-cylinder hand-started auxiliary power unit mounted in the fuselage below the cockpit generated compressed air used to start the main engines. Main wheel brakes were hydraulically controlled with differential braking. The nose of the fuselage was hinged and concealed an opening [...] wide by [...] tall {{that could be used}} <b>for</b> <b>baggage</b> or an auxiliary fuel tank.|$|E
2500|$|Behind {{the engine}} the cabin, under the wing, is {{accessed}} via top hinged doors on both sides. [...] There is a separate, port side door <b>for</b> <b>baggage.</b> The flat {{sides of the}} fuselage taper to the tail. [...] Several undercarriage configurations are available; for land based operations the Tundra builder can choose between tricycle and tailwheel gear. Both use spring cantilever main legs, with large, low pressure tires for work off soft ground; these legs are positioned at the attachment point of the wing struts for the conventional arrangement and further aft for the tricycle gear. Floats can also be fitted, with their main attachment {{at the base of}} the struts and with secondary float struts further aft. [...] Amphibious floats (Montana 2800) may be used. [...] The Tundra may also be equipped with skis. [...] Takeoff roll distances with wheels, skis, and floats are respectively 125 m, 200 m, and 400 m (400ft, 650ft, and 1300ft).|$|E
2500|$|The {{army of the}} Kingdom of Armenia {{reached its}} peak under the reign of Tigranes the Great.

His army consisted mainly of120,000 infantrymen and 12,000 mounted archers, [...] also an important feature of the Parthian army. Like the Seleucids, the bulk of Tigranes' army were foot soldiers. The Jewish historian Josephus talks of 500,000 men in total, including camp followers. These followers consisted of camels, donkeys, and mules used <b>for</b> <b>baggage,</b> sheep, cattle, and goats for food, said to be stocked in abundance for each man, and hoards of gold and silver. As a result, the marching Armenian army was listed as [...] "a huge, irregular force, too many to count, like locusts or the dust of the earth", not unlike many other enormous Eastern armies of the time. The smaller Cappadocian, Graeco-Phoenician, and Nabataean armies were generally {{no match for the}} sheer number of soldiers, with the organized Roman army with its legions eventually posing a much greater challenge to the Armenians.|$|E
