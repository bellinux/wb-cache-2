50|$|The <b>deep</b> <b>artery</b> <b>of</b> the <b>penis</b> (<b>artery</b> to {{the corpus}} cavernosum), {{one of the}} {{terminal}} branches of the internal pudendal, arises from that vessel while it is situated between the two fasciæ of the urogenital diaphragm (deep perineal pouch).|$|R
5000|$|On {{entering}} the cavernous structure from the <b>deep</b> <b>artery</b> <b>of</b> the <b>penis</b> the <b>arteries</b> divide into branches, which are supported and enclosed by the trabeculae. Some <b>of</b> these <b>arteries</b> {{end in a}} capillary net-work, the branches of which open directly into the cavernous spaces; others assume a tendril-like appearance, and form convoluted and somewhat dilated vessels, which were named by Rosenmüller [...] "helicine arteries".|$|R
5000|$|It is perforated, about 2.5 cm. {{below the}} pubic symphysis, by the urethra, the {{aperture}} for which is circular and about 6 mm. in diameter, by the arteries to the bulb, and the ducts of the bulbourethral glands {{close to the}} urethral orifice; by the <b>deep</b> <b>arteries</b> <b>of</b> the <b>penis,</b> one on either side close to the pubic arch, and about halfway along the attached margin of the fascia; by the dorsal <b>arteries</b> and nerves <b>of</b> the <b>penis</b> near {{the apex of the}} fascia.|$|R

40|$|During routine {{dissection}} of {{a middle}} aged male cadaver, an unusual origin <b>of</b> the <b>deep</b> <b>artery</b> <b>of</b> thigh was observed bilaterally. It arose from the femoral artery less than 1 cm distal to the inguinal ligament.

An unnamed branch from the <b>deep</b> <b>artery</b> <b>of</b> thigh {{on the left side}} was seen coursing superolaterally towards the anterior superior iliac spine. The <b>deep</b> external pudendal <b>artery</b> arose from the medial circumflex femoral artery on either side.

50|$|The <b>deep</b> <b>artery</b> <b>of</b> {{the thigh}} {{branches}} off the femoral artery soon after its origin. It travels down the thigh {{closer to the}} femur than the femoral artery, running between the pectineus and the adductor longus, and running on the posterior side of adductor longus. The <b>deep</b> femoral <b>artery</b> does not leave the thigh.|$|R
50|$|Piercing the {{inferior}} layer {{it gives a}} branch to the corpus cavernosum penis, and passes forward, in company with the dorsal <b>artery</b> <b>of</b> the <b>penis,</b> between the layers of the suspensory ligament, on to the dorsum <b>of</b> the <b>penis,</b> and ends on the glans penis.|$|R
50|$|The {{main artery}} {{in the arm}} is the brachial artery. This artery is a {{continuation}} <b>of</b> the axillary <b>artery.</b> The {{point at which the}} axillary becomes the brachial is distal to the lower border of teres major. The brachial artery gives off an unimportant branch, the <b>deep</b> <b>artery</b> <b>of</b> arm. This branching occurs just below the lower border of teres major.|$|R
50|$|The Dorsal <b>Artery</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Penis</b> is {{a branch}} of the {{internal}} pudendal artery which ascends between the crus penis and the pubic symphysis, and, piercing the inferior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm, passes between the two layers of the suspensory ligament <b>of</b> the <b>penis,</b> and runs forward on the dorsum <b>of</b> the <b>penis</b> to the glans, where it divides into two branches, which supply the glans and prepuce.|$|R
50|$|The <b>deep</b> <b>artery</b> <b>of</b> the arm {{travels through}} the lower {{triangular}} space with the radial nerve. From here onwards {{it has an}} intimate relationship with the radial nerve. They are both found deep to the triceps muscle and are located on the spiral groove of the humerus. Therefore, fracture of the bone may not only lead to lesion of the radial nerve, but also haematoma of the internal structures of the arm. The artery then continues on to anastamose with the recurrent radial branch <b>of</b> the brachial <b>artery,</b> providing a diffuse blood supply for the elbow joint.|$|R
40|$|Objective 					To {{assess the}} {{morphological}} changes of penile vascular structures and the corpus cavernosum area in alloxan-induced diabetic rabbits. 				 				 					Materials and Methods 					Twenty male rabbits (2 months old) {{were divided into}} two groups with 10 rabbits each, the control group (CG) and the diabetic group (DG). The animals from DG received an intravenous injection of alloxan (100 mg/kg) to induce the diabetes. Ten weeks after the induction of diabetes, all animals were euthanized. Two fragments of the penile shaft were harvested and samples were processed and paraffin embedded. Sections (5 &# 181;m) were cut and stained for histological and immunohistochemical markers. 				 				 					Results 					Nuclear protrusion toward the lumen, and cytoplasmic vacuolization were observed in the tunica intima <b>of</b> the dorsal <b>artery</b> <b>of</b> the <b>penis</b> in DG. The thicknesses of the tunica media increased significantly in DG (p = 0. 0350). It was also observed {{a significant increase in the}} area of the tunica media (p = 0. 0179). There was no significant change in smooth muscle cell density in the tunica media <b>of</b> the dorsal <b>artery</b> <b>of</b> the <b>penis</b> (p = 0. 0855). The collagen fiber pattern of the tunica adventitia <b>of</b> the dorsal <b>artery</b> <b>of</b> the <b>penis</b> was different between the control and diabetic groups. There was a significant decrease in the area occupied by the cavernous sinuses in DG (p = 0. 0013). 				 				 					Conclusion 					Alloxan-induced diabetes mellitus in rabbits promotes important changes in penile vascular structures, thereby decreasing blood supply and affecting penile hemodynamics, leading to erectile dysfunction...|$|R
50|$|The radial nerve, {{which is}} from the fifth {{cervical}} spinal nerve to the first thoracic spinal nerve, originates as {{the continuation of the}} posterior cord of the brachial plexus. This nerve enters the lower triangular space (an imaginary space bounded by, amongst others, the shaft of the humerus and the triceps brachii) of the arm and lies deep to the triceps brachii. Here it travels with the <b>deep</b> <b>artery</b> <b>of</b> the arm, which sits in the radial groove of the humerus. This fact is very important clinically as a fracture of the shaft of the bone here can cause lesions or even transections in the nerve.|$|R
50|$|The <b>artery</b> <b>of</b> bulb <b>of</b> <b>penis</b> (<b>artery</b> <b>of</b> the {{urethral}} bulb or bulbourethral artery) {{is a short}} <b>artery</b> <b>of</b> large caliber which arises from the internal pudendal artery between the two layers of fascia (the superior and inferior) of the urogenital diaphragm. It passes medialward, pierces the inferior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm and gives off branches which ramify in the bulb of the urethra and in the posterior part of the corpus spongiosum.|$|R
50|$|The penis is {{the male}} intromittent organ. It {{has a long}} shaft and an {{enlarged}} bulbous-shaped tip called the glans penis, which supports and is protected by the foreskin. When the male becomes sexually aroused, the penis becomes erect and ready for sexual activity. Erection occurs because sinuses within the erectile tissue <b>of</b> the <b>penis</b> become filled with blood. The <b>arteries</b> <b>of</b> the <b>penis</b> are dilated while the veins are compressed so that blood flows into the erectile cartilage under pressure. The penis is supplied by the pudendal artery.|$|R
50|$|The {{hip joint}} is {{supplied}} with {{blood from the}} medial circumflex femoral and lateral circumflex femoral arteries, which are both usually branches <b>of</b> the <b>deep</b> <b>artery</b> <b>of</b> the thigh (profunda femoris), but there are numerous variations and one or both may also arise directly from the femoral artery. There is also a small contribution from the foveal artery, a small vessel in the ligament {{of the head of}} the femur which is a branch of the posterior division <b>of</b> the obturator <b>artery,</b> which becomes important to avoid avascular necrosis of the head of the femur when the blood supply from the medial and lateral circumflex arteries are disrupted (e.g. through fracture of the neck of the femur along their course).|$|R
40|$|The signal {{intensity}} of the corpora cavernosa <b>of</b> the <b>penis</b> at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging may vary {{from that of the}} corpus spongio-sum; this difference is dependent on the rate of blood flow within the cavernous spaces that constitute the corporal bodies. Also visible at MR imaging are the layers of fibrous tissue that envelop the corporal bodies, the <b>deep</b> <b>arteries</b> and veins, subcutaneous connective tissue, tunica dartos, epidermis, and urethra. While the iliac, pudendal, peri-neal, and common penile arteries can be evaluated with three-dimen-sional MR angiography, the smaller end <b>arteries</b> <b>of</b> the <b>penis</b> have not yet been reliably demonstrated. MR imaging may be used to detect and stage penile and urethral cancers, identify and characterize benign pe-nile masses, evaluate arteriogenic impotence, identify penile fractures, evaluate penile prostheses, localize periurethral abscesses, and identify plaques of Peyronie disease. With its direct multiplanar imaging capa-bilities, superb soft-tissue contrast, and excellent spatial resolution, high-field surface coil MR imaging can show the soft-tissue and vascu-lar anatomy <b>of</b> the <b>penis,</b> as well as the appearance of many penile dis-eases...|$|R
