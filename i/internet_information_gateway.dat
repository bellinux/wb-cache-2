The Renardus project will implement a Europe wide <b>Internet</b> <b>information</b> <b>gateway</b> service based on a generic broker architecture and data model {{that will allow the}} integrated searching and browsing of distributed resource collections. This report reviews eighteen broker architectures that have been developed for existing services and projects. An attempt has been made to map the function of each of these architectures (or broker models) onto the generic MODELS Information Architecture (MIA) and more specifically the MIA structure developed to describe services known as DNER Portals. The report concludes with some observations on the broker models reviewed and the protocols an...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of the}} MARINFO {{project and}} system is to create the major {{information}} infrastructure for the maritime community - the maritime <b>information</b> <b>gateway.</b> MARINFO achieves this goal by fully exploiting modern information and communication technology as well as recent insights into community -oriented gateway design. For our purposes, a community is defined by a common sphere of activities with commonalities defined - high demands for Homogeneity in function presentation and data visualization. The MARINFO system follows these four principles - the RICH approach to gateway design - and provides enriched information and communication services which exploit - template-oriented visualization for overall presentation homogeneity. Digital representation of resources, internet-based interaction and template-oriented visualization are the technical means by which systems and services are realized, customized and personalized and by which {{a high degree of}} extensibility, automation and overall efficiency is achieved. Categories allow for the extensive and coherent structuring of domains along their essential dimensions - conceptual, organizational, temporal etc. - and provide unifying design guidelines for the entirety of system interfaces and services. From a design point of view MARINFO is a case study in <b>Internet</b> community <b>information</b> <b>gateways,</b> from an implementation point of view it is an exercise in component-oriented software construction. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{collaboration}} between 30 universities, this Virtual Training Suite provides 40 tutorials {{designed to help}} students, lecturers, and researchers improve their <b>Internet</b> <b>information</b> skills. Based on a United Kingdom initiative to offer free online training, these tutorials cover specific web skills for those in disciplines such as math, the history and philosophy of science, geography, bioresearch, earth science, and others. Each tutorial provides expert "tour guides" developed by universities, libraries, museums, and research institutes across the UK. Representative web-based resources are showcased, but the main objective is to teach users {{how to find the}} resources that match their particular needs and interests. The tutorials also focus on the critical and evaluative skills required to judge the merits of specific web resources. There is a glossary, a section for teacher resources, downloadable workbooks, and a discussion on how to cite Internet resources. Each tutorial includes quizzes and interactive exercises. Five hubs for tutorial development include: SOSIG (The Social Science <b>Information</b> <b>Gateway),</b> EEVL (The <b>Internet</b> Guide for Engineering, Mathematics and Computing), BIOME (Internet Resources in Health and Life Sciences), PSIgate (The Physical Sciences <b>Information</b> <b>Gateway)</b> and HUMBUL (The Humanities Hub).

40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} two core {{principles of}} Web 2. 0 - folksonomy and social tagging, as new and alternative means of subject classification, their current applications and potential within information and library systems. Such principles bring up powerful extensions to current subject classification and information retrieval practices. Furthermore it brings up much more enhanced user-friendly interface and retrieval engine efficiency and effectiveness. The particular concept {{is based on}} the implementation of these principles into Uniform <b>Information</b> <b>Gateway,</b> {{one of the most important}} scientific information resources in the Czech Republic. However the architecture of the system is very unique in compare to common online library catalogues it does not restrict the potential of the implementation of folksonomy and tagging. The intended feature is to introduce secondary parallel subject classification system, which does not limit the current classification practices, and brings up new added value in terms of terminology evolution and users' needs observation. Besides the Uniform <b>Information</b> <b>Gateway,</b> there are many more alternatives with the potential of the implementation of folksonomy tagging, e. g. subject <b>information</b> <b>gateways</b> as parts of the Uniform <b>Information</b> <b>Gateway</b> project, or university information systems...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{introduces the}} concept of <b>Internet</b> <b>Information</b> and highlights its crucial role in stock market. At the beginning, I discuss the intrinsic relations between market efficiency and <b>Internet</b> <b>Information</b> and argue that <b>Internet</b> <b>Information</b> serves {{as a way of}} complementing the “data” for understanding the dynamics of stock market. In chapter 2, I give an overview of stock market predictions using <b>Internet</b> <b>Information</b> and put forward some research directions. Naturally, four short essays are presented to illustrate the utilization of <b>Internet</b> <b>Information.</b> In particular, Chapter 3 employs the news appeared in the Internet as the proxy for the rate of information flow and examines the nature of the information-volatility relations. Chapter 4 demonstrates that the familiarity-based investment is driven by information with a unique online information interactive channel. Chapter 5 shows that the investor sentiment constructed by investor’s searching behavior can explain the excess comovement of stock returns. Chapter 6 illustrates the impact of happiness sentiment extracted from social media on stock market performance. In general, this dissertation addresses a timely important issue presented to us in this revolutionary information environment and takes an important step in highlighting the role of <b>Internet</b> <b>Information</b> in stock market...|$|R
