60|$|Rose was silenced, {{though she}} had too much {{tenderness}} in behalf of her own youthful and manly bridegroom to dread a fate similar to that which had overtaken poor <b>Jack.</b> <b>Spike</b> now seemed disposed to say something, {{and she went to}} the side of his bed, followed by her companion, who kept a little in the back-ground, as if unwilling to let the emotion she really felt be seen, and, perhaps, conscious that her ungainly appearance did not aid her in recovering the lost affections of her husband.|$|E
50|$|New <b>Jack,</b> <b>Spike</b> Dudley and John Kronus {{joined the}} 6-man match already in {{progress}} {{to make it}} a 9-man match. This was the only CyberSlam to broadcast on pay-per-view (PPV) (in some areas only).|$|E
50|$|When Dallas took possession, <b>Jack</b> <b>Spikes</b> {{promptly}} darted around left end for 33 yards, {{augmented by}} a 15-yard face mask penalty against Houston. Dawson then hit Abner Haynes, who had lined up as a flanker, on a curl-out pattern and Haynes scooted {{down the right}} sideline for 28 yards and a touchdown. Brooker's extra-point made it 10-0, Dallas.|$|R
5000|$|TCU went 3 for 11 on {{passing for}} a woeful 37 yards but had 190 yards rushing on 48 attempts. Air Force barely did better with 12 for 23 passing for 91 {{yards and two}} interceptions. Both teams {{finished}} with over 227 yards yet had more punts (16) then points. Dave Phillips of Air Force and <b>Jack</b> <b>Spikes</b> of TCU were named Outstanding Players.|$|R
50|$|The Raiders {{lost their}} second {{consecutive}} {{game in a}} Friday night matchup against Hank Stram's Dallas Texans. The Texans jumped out to an early 10-0 lead after a field goal and a touchdown pass from Cotton Davidson to Max Boydston. Oakland responded with 26-yard touchdown pass from Babe Parilli to Tony Teresa. The Texans' <b>Jack</b> <b>Spikes</b> ran for a 15-yard score in the second quarter, and Oakland responded with a field goal. After scoring a third-quarter field goal, Dallas pulled away with two touchdowns (rushing and receiving) from Johnny Robinson.|$|R

50|$|<b>Jack</b> Erwin <b>Spikes</b> (born February 5, 1937) is {{a former}} American {{football}} running back and placekicker. He played in the American Football League (NFL) for the Dallas Texans/Kansas City Chiefs, Houston Oilers, and the Buffalo Bills. He played college football at Texas Christian University (TCU).|$|R
50|$|Hull played college {{football}} at Wake Forest and {{was selected by}} the National Football League's Chicago Bears in the 3rd round (35th overall) of the 1962 NFL Draft and the AFL's Boston Patriots in the 5th round (38th overall) of the 1962 AFL Draft but did not play for either team. He played only one season professionally with the AFL's Dallas Texans. He intercepted George Blanda {{late in the first}} overtime of professional football's longest championship game. In that 1962 American Football League Championship game against the Houston Oilers, Hull's interception allowed the Texans to start the second overtime with two runs by <b>Jack</b> <b>Spikes</b> to move the ball to the Oilers' 25-yard line, and Tommy Brooker kicked a field goal to give the Texans the win, 20 - 17.|$|R
50|$|After {{losing the}} title, The Gangstanators {{continued}} their feud with the Dudleys. Spike Dudley also entered the feud {{on the side}} of the New Jack and Kronus, fighting against his kayfabe brothers. He joined The Gangstanators in six-man matches and sometimes took Kronus' place as New Jack's partner. As the year went on, Kronus, New <b>Jack,</b> and <b>Spike</b> Dudley focused more on their singles careers, although they still teamed with each other on occasion.|$|R
5000|$|Brooker was {{a member}} of the Texans team that won the 1962 AFL Championship game, the Texans {{defeating}} the Houston Oilers (who had won the first two AFL title games, in 1960 and 1961) at Jeppesen Stadium. It would be the franchise's final game before their move from Dallas to Kansas City. Teammate Bill Hull intercepted the Oilers' George Blanda late in the first overtime of professional football's longest championship game. Hull's interception allowed the Texans to start the second overtime with two runs by <b>Jack</b> <b>Spikes</b> to move the ball to the Oilers' 25-yard line, and Brooker kicked a field goal to give the Texans the win, 20- 17. The field goal saved Texans star running back Abner Haynes from what could have been a costly error: at the start of the overtime, Haynes won the coin toss and stated that his team would [...] "kick to the clock", which not only gave the Oilers first possession, but put the wind at their backs (the Oilers having gotten the choice of which end zone to defend). The Texans saved Haynes from embarrassment by preventing Houston from scoring in the first overtime; after the teams switched sides for the second, Brooker kicked the winning field goal 2 minutes and 54 seconds in.|$|R
5000|$|Jack Osborne {{returns to}} the bar to {{discover}} that Craig isn't doing his shift. <b>Jack</b> asks <b>Spike</b> if he knows where Craig is and Spike replies [...] "He said something about going for a lie down", knowing that John Paul and Craig have just gone upstairs together. Craig and John Paul are yet again in bed together and have exchanged the 'I Love You's' when they hear Jack coming up the stairs, so John Paul hides under the covers. Jack assumes {{that it must be}} Sarah hiding under the duvet and apologises. <b>Jack</b> tells <b>Spike</b> {{that he did not know}} Sarah was with Craig upstairs - now Spike knows about the John Paul/Craig relationship. Spike enjoys teasing Craig that he knows about him and John Paul, but is secretly gutted about the affair. Sarah joins Craig and John Paul at the college to get their exam results. Craig is terrified that Spike will reveal the secret, while John Paul is determined not to worry and have fun. They celebrate at The Dog in The Pond and John Paul gets drunk with Nancy, not knowing Craig spends much of the exam celebrations watching John Paul longingly wishing he was with him.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{overtime}} {{started with}} a potentially damaging gaffe by Dallas captain Abner Haynes, who won the toss and elected to [...] "kick to the clock". What Haynes wanted was the strong wind behind his team, but, by saying [...] "kick" [...] first, he gave the Oilers the choice of having the wind at their backs. As it turned out, it didn't matter. The first overtime went scoreless, but Bill Hull intercepted a Blanda pass to end it with the Texans at the Oilers' 48. In the second overtime, <b>Jack</b> <b>Spikes</b> picked up ten yards on a pass reception and nineteen yards on a rush. After the Texans ran a couple of plays to position the ball, rookie Tommy Brooker came in on fourth-and-nine, and calmly kicked a 25-yard field goal after 2:54 of the sixth quarter, or 17:54 of sudden-death overtime, to end the game. The Houston Oilers had come within a hair's breadth of winning the first three AFL championships, but the Texans prevailed, 20-17, in their last game before moving north to Missouri to become the Kansas City Chiefs. They would win the AFL title again in 1966 and 1969, gaining berths {{in the first and}} fourth Super Bowls.|$|R
50|$|Hennessey’s other {{interests}} of note are researching {{and writing about}} the history of the San Francisco Sheriff’s Department, riding a horse in local parades with a group called the San Francisco Sheriff’s Mounted Posse, and a quirky interest in San Francisco’s punk rock culture. He is widely quoted in a recent history of the local punk rock scene, Gimme Something Better, by <b>Jack</b> Boulware and <b>Spike</b> Tudor.|$|R
60|$|As soon as {{the game}} was over, Gif, aided by Mr. Crews, began an investigation, closely {{questioning}} all of the players and those looking on who had seen the encounter between Brown and Jack. Of course, there were various versions of the affair, but the consensus of opinions {{seemed to be that}} the tackle had been an unfair one and that Brown could have avoided <b>spiking</b> <b>Jack</b> had he been more careful. It was likewise considered unfair to use spiked shoes even in a practice game.|$|R
50|$|Comedy {{has been}} a {{recurring}} theme in his show business career, which began with his impersonation of two famous 'camp' comedians, Kenneth Williams and Frankie Howerd, then progressed to {{his role in the}} television situation comedy Goodnight Sweetheart camping it up as Noël Coward, and has now come full circle with his radio work, in which he plays comedy roles that owe much to the high-camp style popularised by Kenneth Williams. He cites the radio shows of <b>Jack</b> Benny and <b>Spike</b> Milligan as his earliest comedy influences.|$|R
50|$|Set in Cape Town, South Africa Mama Jack is {{the story}} of Jack Theron, an {{ordinary}} person working on a film set as a grip. However, his movie producer boss, John Daragon, hates him and wants to remove him from the production of the movie they are producing about Nelson Mandela, Sweet Bird of Freedom. In a bid to get rid of <b>Jack,</b> the producer <b>spikes</b> his drink with a fictitious drug, Mama Africa at a glamorous function, and before long Jack has unwittingly offended all the attending dignitaries, ruined the function and got himself {{on the wrong side of}} the law while hallucinating.|$|R
60|$|Spike looked astonished, {{and well}} he might, {{for he had}} {{supposed}} Jack to be dead fully fifteen years. Time and hard service had greatly altered him, but the general resemblance in figure, stature, and waddle, certainly remained. Notwithstanding, the <b>Jack</b> Tier that <b>Spike</b> remembered was quite a different person from this Jack Tier. That Jack had worn his intensely black hair clubbed and curled, whereas this Jack had cut his locks into short bristles, which time had turned into an intense gray. That Jack was short and thick, but he was flat and square; whereas this Jack was just as short, a good deal thicker, and as round as a dumpling. In one thing, however, the likeness still remained perfect. Both Jacks chewed tobacco, {{to a degree that}} became a distinct feature in their appearance.|$|R
500|$|While Frank {{attempts}} to mend {{his relationship with}} doodle Lonette, he temporarily leaves detective duties to his assistant Nails. Jack and Holli leave for the real world, causing damage to the interdimensional barrier between {{the real world and}} the Cool World. Frank discovers that Nails has been done away with and decides to venture into the real world to pursue Jack and Holli. While contemplating their situation, Holli tells Jack about the [...] "Spike of Power", an artifact placed {{on the top of a}} Las Vegas casino by a doodle who crossed into the real world. When Jack displays skepticism about the idea, Holli abandons Jack to search for the spike on her own. When Frank pursues Holli on the casino, Holli kills him by kicking him off the building. Holli finds and takes the Spike of Power, transforming her and Jack into doodles and releasing numerous monstrous doodles into the real world. Fighting off an increasing number of doodles as a superhero doodle, <b>Jack</b> returns the <b>Spike</b> of Power to its place, trapping him, Holli and the rest of the doodles in Cool World. Since Frank was killed by Holli while she was in doodle form, he is reborn in Cool World as a doodle, allowing him to pursue his relationship with Lonette.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{will explore}} the social, {{cultural}} and musical impact of Duke Ellington in the UK, focussing on his 1933 {{tour of the}} country, his appearances at the Royal Festival Hall and the Leeds Centenary Festival in 1958 and the premiere of the Third Sacred Concert in London in 1973. These performances, which span Ellington’s career, each took place {{within the context of}} particular social and political circumstances, in a range of performance situations and in different regions of the UK. Ellington’s first visit to Britain in the interwar years took him from the Palladium, one of London’s leading variety halls, to similar venues in Liverpool, Glasgow and Birmingham. During this tour, Ellington and his musicians also played late-night dances and Sunday concerts and. Ellington’s music was familiar mainly among musicians and critics at this time, and whilst trying to meet the high expectations of these influential figures, such as through Melody Maker sponsored Musicians’ Concerts in London, he also had to entertain the general public at these venues. This first visit inspired Ellington to compose ‘Hyde Park’ as a tribute to London, but upon meeting the monarch in 1958, he wrote the more extensive ‘Queen’s Suite’. Whilst the 1933 visit was essentially the result of the enthusiasm and patronage of individuals, namely <b>Jack</b> Hylton and <b>Spike</b> Hughes, and the subsequent tour was probably an unplanned afterthought, the band’s next appearance in the UK demonstrates the strength that Ellington’s reputation had gathered in the intervening years. In 1958, following appearances at the Royal Festival Hall in London, a major concert venue, Ellington’s band opened and closed the jazz section of the Leeds Festival, which was otherwise largely devoted to classical music. Ultimately, Ellington’s work was heard in yet another prestigious setting in the UK, when his Third Sacred Concert was first performed in Westminster Abbey on 24 October 1973 in celebration of United Nations Day. These three visits provide a rich basis for comparative study of the British reception of Ellington’s developing musical style as demonstrated by these performances, and for wider conclusions to be drawn regarding the attitudes to African American jazz in different periods, places and situations. Contemporary sources, including reviews from local and national papers together with oral history material, will be used to gauge the reaction of critics and audiences in the UK. Furthermore, these three occurrences exemplify the reciprocal nature of cultural exchange between the USA and the UK. Whilst the inspiration that the visits offered to Ellington is frequently considered, this chapter will also explore his influence on British jazz musicians during this forty-year period. ...|$|R
