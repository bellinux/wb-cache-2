5|$|Although no {{specific}} {{studies have been}} done on the black catbird's feeding ecology, it is thought to be an omnivore, like <b>its</b> <b>close</b> relatives are. It is known to eat the fruits of Bursera simaruba and Ficus cotinifolia, two deciduous trees found in the Neotropics.|$|E
5|$|Because of <b>its</b> <b>close</b> {{proximity}} to the sea, Jaywick {{had never been a}} practical place for farming due to the risk from floods; and the land remained unused. A sea wall was built in 1880 to protect against flooding. Ordnance Survey mapping around 1897 shows Jaywick as a few farmhouses near what is now Crossways on the Tudor estate.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>its</b> <b>close</b> {{proximity}} to islands along its path, Dovi caused only minimal damage. Oceanic swells and storm surge were felt in some coastal areas. Strong winds {{were reported in}} the southern Cook Islands and Niue. Damage to banana plantations on Palmerston Island was reported, but Dovi caused no fatalities.|$|E

50|$|The Stern-Brocot tree may {{itself be}} defined {{directly}} {{in terms of}} mediants: the left child of any number q is the mediant of q with <b>its</b> <b>closest</b> smaller ancestor, and the right child of q is the mediant of q with <b>its</b> <b>closest</b> larger ancestor. In this formula, q and its ancestor must both be taken in lowest terms, {{and if there is}} no smaller or larger ancestor then 0/1 or 1/0 should be used respectively. Again, using 7/5 as an example, <b>its</b> <b>closest</b> smaller ancestor is 4/3, so its left child is (4 + 7)/(3 + 5) = 11/8, and <b>its</b> <b>closest</b> larger ancestor is 3/2, so its right child is (7 + 3)/(5 + 2) = 10/7.|$|R

5|$|It {{can become}} quite bold and tame, much like <b>its</b> <b>close</b> relative, the pied currawong on the Australian mainland, {{especially}} in public parks and gardens where people make {{a habit of}} feeding it. Black currawongs have been recorded taking young peas from pods, raiding orchards, seizing chickens from poultry yards, and entering barns in search of mice.|$|E

5|$|The {{foramen spinosum}} {{is often used}} as a {{landmark}} in neurosurgery, due to <b>its</b> <b>close</b> relations with other cranial foramina. It was first described by Jakob Benignus Winslow in the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{great auk}} was never {{observed}} and described by modern scientists during its existence, {{and is only}} known from the accounts of laymen, such as sailors, so its behaviour is not well known and difficult to reconstruct.

5|$|A 2008 paper saw {{a return}} to white-eye {{taxonomy}} with the formal description of the Togian white-eye Zosterops somadikartai, an endemic species of the Togian Islands of Indonesia, which, unlike most of its relatives, lacks the white ring around the eye which give this group of birds its name. Rasmussen noted that the Togian white-eye is distinctive not only in its appearance, but also in its lilting song, which sounds higher pitched and is less varied in frequency than the songs of <b>its</b> <b>close</b> relatives.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2004, {{the well}} known Potentially Hazardous Asteroid 4179 Toutatis came about 4 Lunar Distances from Earth.

However, Toutatis arrived during a full moon, and thus 's 2001 encounter {{is still the most}} easily observed flyby of an asteroid in history.

5|$|Although {{there are}} many Cortinarius species {{with some degree of}} violet colour, C.violaceus and <b>its</b> <b>close</b> {{relatives}} are easily distinguished by their much darker purple colour. Cortinarius iodes of the southeastern United States has a slimy purple cap and paler violet stipe. The other species in the section Cortinarius are dark purple and superficially similar, but can be differentiated based on host and geography as they do not occur in the same locations as C. violaceus. Certain Leptonia species in northwestern North America, including L. carnea and L. nigroviolacea, have a similar color, but are easily differentiated due to their pink spore print.|$|E
5|$|Because of <b>its</b> <b>close</b> {{proximity}} to the higher Helvellyn, Nethermost Pike receives fewer visitors. When climbing from the west many people traverse the western slopes {{on their way to}} Helvellyn. Despite this the summit does still receive a large number of walkers, who use a large number of footpaths. The large number of footpaths causes significant disturbance to the summit vegetation, which could be greatly reduced by using fewer footpaths.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium's {{chemical}} {{behavior is}} largely {{a result of its}} small atomic and ionic radii. It thus has very high ionization potentials and strong polarization while bonded to other atoms, which is why all of its compounds are covalent. It is more chemically similar to aluminium than <b>its</b> <b>close</b> neighbors in the periodic table due to having a similar charge-to-radius ratio.|$|E

5|$|Cal Poly Pomona's {{dominant}} landmark is a futurist-styled administrative facility {{known as}} the CLA Building which was designed by Antoine Predock and opened in 1993. The building’s peculiar shape (standing out by a triangular-shaped “skyroom” atop its eight-story tower) {{has become a symbol}} of the university; in addition, <b>its</b> <b>close</b> location to film studios based in the Hollywood borough of Los Angeles have prompted its inclusion in motion pictures such as Gattaca and Impostor. In 2013, the California State University Board of Trustees voted to demolish the building {{and replace it with a}} new academic/faculty complex because of severe seismic risks.|$|E
5|$|Coins of both Carausius and Allectus {{have been}} {{discovered}} buried in {{the foundations of the}} fort's walls. A later coin of 330–335 was found under a tower in the 1930s, suggesting that the fort may have undergone a major repair or reconstruction around that time. The usurpers had inherited an existing system of coastal defence – the earlier Saxon Shore forts – and may have decided to augment it with the construction of Pevensey Castle and <b>its</b> <b>close</b> contemporary, Portus Adurni (Portchester Castle).|$|E
5|$|Crossroads was {{released}} in the United States on February 15, 2002.

On the first weekend of its release, Crossroads placed second, grossing an estimate of $14,527,187. By the second week, the film dropped a 52% on tickets sales, ranking at number 5 on the Box Office. Crossroads was a moderate financial success, grossing a total $37,191,304 in the United States.

5|$|Hypogeomys australis is an extinct rodent {{from central}} and southeastern Madagascar. First {{described}} in 1903, it {{is larger than}} <b>its</b> <b>close</b> relative, the living Hypogeomys antimena, which occurs further west, but otherwise similar. Average length of the femur (upper leg bone) is 72.1mm, compared to 63.8mm in H.antimena. One of the few extinct rodents of Madagascar, it survived to at least around 1536 BP based on radiocarbon dating. Little is known of its ecology, but it may have lived in burrows like its living relative and eaten some arid-adapted plants.|$|E
