5|$|In {{terms of}} combat, the game allows players {{to create and}} {{customise}} their own move combos in the Combo Lab, which uses four categories of fighting moves called Pressens. This is done by chaining them together, made possible through earning PMP (Procedural Mastering Power), with a limit of four combos being active at any one time. The Pressen moves are Regen (healing), Power (damage), Chain (duplication and doubling of previous moves) and Cooldown (regeneration of S-Pressen energy). There are 50,000 possible Pressen combinations. Five S-Pressen moves will {{be made available to}} the player {{over the course of the}} game: the moves enable them to <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> stun groups of enemies, move at high speed and land more hits, or turn hostile robots into allies which then self-destruct. Players also have access to projectile-based weapons like the Spammer and Junk Bolt.|$|E

In general, however, a person with macular edema {{is likely to have}} blurred vision, making it hard to <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> read or drive. In some cases, the vision will get better or worse during the day.|$|E

500|$|Tsakalotos {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "Marxist", and Ovenden has written that [...] "While Keynes is the main economic reference point for Varoufakis, who opposed the Brussels deal, for Tsakalotos, who signed it, Marx is more that guide to economic and political analysis." [...] Paul Mason described Tsakalotos as a [...] "classic Marxist of the New Left," [...] continuing that [...] "Tsakalotos comes from that school of Marxism which learned from the 1970s onwards to make compromises with capitalist reality." [...] In an interview with the Financial Times in September 2015, following his re-appointment, he said: [...] "I’m one of the government’s most left-wing ministers, politically speaking. However, I want to <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> the recapitalisation of the banks. I can do things that aren’t particularly left-wing." ...|$|E
500|$|Robben {{has been}} often accused of diving, {{and he has}} at times openly {{admitted}} to the charges. In December 2011, Robben apologised for a dive against VfL Bochum in a DFB-Pokal match which earned him a yellow card, saying, [...] "I must not <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> this." [...] In July 2014, Robben admitted to diving {{in the first half}} of Netherlands' match against Mexico in the last 16 round of the 2014 World Cup, but maintained that he had not dived for the decisive penalty he won in stoppage time which Netherlands converted to win 2–1. Following the incident, Robben's former manager at Chelsea, José Mourinho, claimed that Robben's speed and creativity cause opponents who cannot stop him to foul him, but [...] "sometimes [...] tries to get an advantage, or to get a penalty".|$|E

500|$|According to guitarist Marty Friedman, it {{took the}} band a year to prepare the record [...] "from note one to mixing". A lot of the {{material}} was written during the tour {{and some of it}} afterwards. As Friedman said, the songs came together naturally because the band wasn't rushed to get a record out. The album was produced by Dann Huff, who had his producing debut with Megadeth. The band chose to work with Huff because they were not satisfied with Max Norman, the producer of their previous record. Mustaine explained why he decided to quit the collaboration with Norman: [...] "Max came up with this bullshit formula that every song had to be 120 beats per minute to get on the radio. When people make drastic decisions to <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> that and it backfires, it usually ends up, in one way or another, costing them their jobs." ...|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles Times Betsy Sharkey {{was more}} positive, stating that [...] "the funniest stuff {{comes from the}} kind of {{situational}} misfires that can happen when dudes try to <b>do</b> <b>things,</b> <b>like</b> catch aliens, that they are clearly not cut out to do". She considered that Schaffer's previous experience directing short comic videos for Saturday Night Live was partially responsible for individual comic moments broken up by transitions where [...] "things tend to fall apart". Screencrushs Matt Singer was positive, calling the film funny and praising the improvisational feel of the scenes and [...] "ingenious" [...] set-pieces, but was critical of the promotion of Costco and Costco products throughout. Boxoffices James Rocchi offered a positive stance, stating that the [...] "plot moves, the supporting cast is lively and the action stays small-scale and intimate, never overwhelming the laughs"; he felt that the profanity and vulgarity never became [...] "stale". Rocchi, however, commented that the film was forgettable and [...] "disposable".|$|E

[...] The group, dubbed [...] "Classical Band Aid", recorded the track at Metropolis Studios and were backed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.

[...] Seth Abramovitch of TV.com expressed his dissatisfaction with her attitude: [...] "Zizes isn't just a heavy, supremely confident girl. She's also extremely violent. She’s on the wrestling team, speaks regularly of injuring Puck, and, in one hallway smackdown against the jealous Santana Lopez, proved she was {{a lot more than just}} bark. And you did catch that part about Zizes wanting to be famous for famous' sake, right? That she was willing to give herself up to Puck purely in pursuit of a reality show and fragrance line? There’s a word for people who <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> that in the real world: It's 'asshole'." [...] He went on to add: [...] "Zizes has been hailed by feminists groups (well, by Bust Magazine) as a new kind of plus-sized heroine—an obese female role model who for once doesn't hate herself. On the contrary, she thinks she's the bee's knees. When 'Puck serenaded her with Queen's [...] "Fat-Bottomed Girls," [...] she rebuffed him, saying, 'I look like America looks, and just like America, I need more than just a song to get my juices flowing'." ...|$|E
500|$|Taylor summoned Khánh to his office, but the Vietnamese leader sent Thi, Kỳ, Thiệu and Admiral Chung Tấn Cang, the {{commander}} of the Republic of Vietnam Navy, instead. Taylor asked the four to sit down and then said [...] "Do all of you understand English?" [...] The ambassador then angrily denounced the officers. According to Stanley Karnow, Taylor [...] "launched into a tirade, scolding them as if he were still superintendent of West Point and they a group of cadets caught cheating". He said [...] "I told you all clearly at General Westmoreland's dinner we Americans were tired of coups. Apparently I wasted my words." [...] He decried the removal of the HNC as [...] "totally illegal", and said it had [...] "destroyed the government-making process", and that [...] "I made it clear that all the military plans I know you would like to carry out are dependent on government stability", something he felt had been lost with the dismissal of the HNC. He said [...] "...you have made a real mess. We cannot carry you forever if you <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> this." [...] Taylor believed the HNC to be {{an essential part of the}} government, because as an American, he believed civilian legitimacy was a must. For him, the HNC was a necessary step in a progression towards an elected civilian legislature, which he regarded as critical for national and military morale. The historian Mark Moyar regarded Taylor's intervention as unnecessary, and noted that there had been many instances of fierce fighting in Vietnamese history despite the complete absence of democracy throughout the nation's history. Taylor also reminded them of an earlier meeting where he had discussed an American plan to expand the war, increase funding for the South Vietnamese military, and to go on the offensive against the communists at the request of Khánh. Taylor said the Americans would not be able to help Saigon pursue their desired military strategy if the political machinations did not stop. Taylor said that if the military did not transfer some powers or advisory capacity back to the HNC or another civilian institution, aid would be withheld, and some planned military operations against the Ho Chi Minh trail—which was being used to infiltrate communists into the south—would be suspended.|$|E

Songs such as [...] "Real World," [...] with lyrics like, [...] "You want to change the world, by breaking rules and laws; people don't <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> that in the real world at all," [...] helped to illustrate that the band was capable of writing songs with a deeper, more personal meaning. This represented a shift from the perceived punk ethos of the time.
