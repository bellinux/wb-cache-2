5000|$|During up-peak mode (also called {{moderate}} incoming traffic), elevator cars in a {{group are}} recalled to the lobby to provide expeditious service to passengers arriving at the building, most typically in the morning as people arrive for work or {{at the conclusion of}} a lunch-time period. Elevators are dispatched one-by-one when they reach a pre-determined passenger load, or when they have had their doors opened for a certain period of time. The next elevator to be dispatched usually has its <b>hall</b> <b>lantern</b> or a [...] "this car leaving next" [...] sign illuminated to encourage passengers to make maximum use of the available elevator system capacity. Some elevator banks are programmed so that at least one car will always return to the lobby floor and park whenever it becomes free.|$|E
50|$|In February 2016 {{the band}} played at the 6music festival at Colston <b>Hall's</b> <b>Lantern</b> venue, being {{introduced}} by Gideon Coe and in April 2016 they were personally chosen by curator Stewart Lee to play the ATP festival at Pontins Prestatyn.|$|R
50|$|Stanfield Hall is {{a medieval}} manor {{situated}} within a medieval moat, which is {{connected by a}} 16th-century brick bridge. The Hall is presented with a Tudor-style exterior which {{dates back to the}} late 18th and early 19th century. Its interior composes of a Gothic staircase <b>hall</b> and <b>lantern</b> with surrounding rooms similar of style. Its exterior also includes a range of well-preserved stables. The Hall is infamous for the double murder of Isaac Jermy and his son that occurred on 28 November 1848.|$|R
50|$|It was {{restored}} to its original colour scheme in 2013,and the Octagonal lantern returned to its former position in the <b>hall.</b> The Octagonal <b>lantern</b> was specifically designed for the space by Sir Albert Richardson in the 1950s, who was the architect who led {{the conversion of the}} building. It is sometimes incorrectly referenced as a 19th-century Chinese lantern.|$|R
60|$|When Challoner and {{his guests}} {{returned}} to the house, he showed them the best bits of the old carved oak with which it was decorated and some curious works of art he had picked up in India, and then he {{took them to the}} picture gallery which ran round the big square <b>hall.</b> A <b>lantern</b> dome admitted a cold light, but a few sunrays struck through a window looking to the southwest and fell in long bright bars on polished floor and somber paneling. On entering the gallery, Challoner took out a case of miniatures and, placing it on a small table, brought a chair for Mrs. Keith.|$|R
50|$|New {{designs for}} St George's Hall and the Queen's Private Chapel were {{approved}} by the Queen on 24 January 1995. Designed by architect Giles Downes, the new roof for St George's Hall {{is an example of}} a hammer-beam ceiling. The new chapel and adjoining cloisters were realigned to form a processional route from the private apartments, through an octagonal vestibule, into St George's Hall. Downes's new roof is the largest green-oak structure built since the Middle Ages and is decorated with brightly coloured shields celebrating the heraldic element of the Order of the Garter; the design attempts to create an illusion of additional height through the Gothic woodwork along the ceiling. Commentators have noted that Downes's work does much to compensate for the originally flawed dimensions of the <b>hall.</b> The <b>Lantern</b> Lobby has oak columns forming a vaulted ceiling, imitating an arum lily.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the morning}} of the 5th, each district's banners and {{portable}} shrines make a procession with a Shinto priest in the lead, and a Shinto ceremony is performed. After this, the procession makes a lap around town, and returns to the shrine. On years when the yotsudaiko have been built anew, the yotsudaiko also accompany this procession. When this is the case, the procession goes to the beach and the new yotsudaiko are purified in the waves. After the procession has returned to the shrine, dances such as the sparrow dance and the [...] "Kehon Dance" [...] are performed. (The Kehon Dance has been designated as the prefecture's number one abstract cultural asset.) Next, the banners, portable shrines, and yotsudaiko begin a procession outside the shrine as lion dances and the [...] "Yatsu Dance" [...] are performed inside. At the end of the night, each district's portable shrines once again enter the shrine grounds in order, although they struggle against one another to keep from entering for as long as possible. The yotsudaiko chant [...] "rainenno, rainenno nagonagori shanai," [...] which means [...] "can't help that next year we'll be reluctant to part too." [...] Once they have all returned to the shrine <b>hall,</b> the <b>lanterns</b> are extinguished and it is said that the ancestors' spirits return as well to the shrine as the festival ends.|$|R
5000|$|A new {{license to}} produce a Fringe in Calgary was secured from the Canadian Association of Fringe Festivals in 2005 by a new team headed by Blair Gallant and Jason Rothery, and a new Fringe {{was held in the}} summer of 2006. Many {{elements}} have changed from the earlier Fringes, including time, scope and locations. The Fringe is now a full-length 8-day Fringe: 2016 dates are Fri. July 29--Sat. Aug. 6, almost the same time as Saskatoon Fringe, and just before the Aug. 11 start of the Edmonton Fringe. [...] In previous years when they overlapped, a number of shows were performed at both Fringes, either closing in Calgary early or opening in Edmonton late. In addition to the theatrical performances (greatly increased to 36 from the roughly dozen in the 01 and 02 Fringes), the 2006 Calgary Fringe included street performances and vendors (typical for a Fringe) as well as a film festival, visual arts displays and live music (less common). The 2006 Calgary Fringe was held at a number of venues; the festival elements, film, visual art and music were held on 17th Avenue in the Beltline district, with the theatrical performances split between the nearby Calgary Opera rehearsal hall and the more distant EPCOR Centre for the Performing Arts, located in the downtown. The sanctuary and fellowship <b>hall</b> of the <b>Lantern</b> Church are two of the four main venues for Calgary Fringe Festival performances.|$|R
