500|$|Spassky played Tartakower's Defense (7...b6), his {{favorite}} choice in many tournaments {{and a line}} with which he had never lost. After 14.Bb5!? (introduced in Furman–Geller, Moscow 1970), Spassky responded with 14...a6?!. Geller had previously shown Spassky 14...Qb7!, the move with which Geller later beat Jan Timman at Hilversum 1973, but Spassky apparently <b>forgot</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> [...] After 21.f4 Fischer had the upper hand (Hort). After 26.f5, White had a crushing attack.|$|E
500|$|... "Women's Appreciation" [...] {{was written}} by Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg, while Tucker Gates served as the episode's director. The cold open {{featuring}} Jim receiving a demerit from Dwight was initially intended for [...] "Business School", {{and the opening of}} [...] "Product Recall", which featured Jim and Dwight impersonating each other, was first intended for this episode before it was moved because of time constraints. Michael's talking head scene about Jan's safeword was meant to serve as a [...] "place holder" [...] until a better version could be shot, but was left in the episode because the writers <b>forgot</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> While the characters travel to Mall at Steamtown, a shopping center in Scranton, Pennsylvania, episode filming actually took place near Los Angeles, where the series is normally shot.|$|E
500|$|In {{developing}} the storyline {{of the series}} Featherstone said that [...] "the team took what was wonderful from [...] and then <b>forgot</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> in the nicest possible way, and made their own show." [...] While working for the series, Richards worked with Hans Rosenfeldt, the Swedish writer who created The Bridge. Many aspects of the first episode are virtual copies of the first episode of the Scandinavian series, including: the female lead [...] "stripping unselfconsciously to her underwear in the office", the male lead's relationship with his teenage son, and the [...] "sleazy journalist [...] held captive in his own car with a ticking bomb", the last {{of which was a}} sequence Richards wanted to repeat in the remake. However, Richards said that as the series progressed and the drama unfolded the storylines would diverge from the original. Featherstone also noted there would be plenty of changes, saying that many had [...] "seen both , who feel that they get satisfaction because the characters go on different journeys and the actors all bring a whole new level of interest in it".|$|E

500|$|For {{the finale}} of the manga, Kishimoto {{originally}} intended to give Boruto the Byakugan, an eye technique which he would inherit from his mother Hinata Hyuga. However, the author <b>forgot</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and instead gave him an unknown eye technique (it allows him to see chakra, an energy source within ninjas to perform jutsu) which is often shown on Boruto's right eye. During July 2017, one of the animators from [...] revealed Boruto's eye is called [...] and that its powers {{are related to the}} Byakugan and Naruto's ability to sense negative emotions. However, the animator refrained from explaining more about since the Jōgan would be explained later in the series. In the first few pages of the first chapter, Boruto's first encounter against Kawaki was briefly shown. The purpose was to attract more fans so they could look forward to the battle as it has a chaotic state to it. Due to the staff of the Naruto anime referring to Naruto and Sasuke as [...] "legendary characters", anime developers Pierrot aim to carefully portray Boruto and his friends, the [...] "new generation", as the new protagonists. They also seek to have them developed as the previous generation. However, Kishimoto is concerned about how Boruto and his friends could reach Naruto and Sasuke's strength as he finds it repetitive.|$|E
500|$|Putana (also {{called as}} poothani), the [...] "killer of infants", {{was sent by}} Krishna's evil uncle Kamsa to kill Krishna. Putana assumed the {{disguise}} of a young, beautiful woman and came to Gokul (Vraj) - Krishna's home-town. Her beauty resulted in her being mistaken by gopas (cowherds) {{as a manifestation of}} goddess Lakshmi. Stunned by her beauty, Krishna's foster-mother Yashoda allowed Putana to take the infant Krishna into her lap and breast-feed him. Putana had smeared her breast with a mandana, an intoxicant, to kill Krishna. [...] However, Krishna squeezed her breasts and took her life away(prana), as well as her milk. (Putana had got blessing [...] in her previous life from Lord Vishnu that she will meet lord Vishnu's avtaar in human form in her next life but she <b>forgot</b> <b>about</b> <b>it).</b> In pain, Putana screamed, pleading for her release, but in vain. She ran out of the town with Krishna still clinging to her and finally fell dead. [...] She then assumed her real demonic form, turning trees to a distance of three gavyuti (a unit of distance equivalent totally to 12 miles) to dust. The people of Vraj cut Putana's body, burying her bones and feet and burning the flesh and skin. The fragrant smoke rose out of the flames, as Putana was cleansed of all sin by breast-feeding Krishna and she attained the same heaven that Yashoda acquired. Thus, Putana, like Yashodha, is also considered as a foster-mother of Krishna as she breast-fed him.|$|E

2500|$|Also in 1966, in {{an article}} Esquire {{magazine}} would later name as the best magazine piece ever written, the journalist Gay Talese wrote about the goings-on around the enigmatic Frank Sinatra.

2500|$|Toole {{claimed to}} have picked Walsh up in a Sears mall parking lot. Toole said he offered him candy and toys and that Walsh came willingly.

2500|$|In November 1906, Caruso {{was charged}} with an indecent act {{allegedly}} committed in the monkey house of New York's Central Park Zoo.

The leaders of New York's opera-going high society were outraged initially by the incident, which received widespread newspaper coverage, but they soon <b>forgot</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and continued to attend Caruso's Met performances. Caruso's fan base at the Met was not restricted, however, to the wealthy.
