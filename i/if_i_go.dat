500|$|Iain Glen, who has portrayed Jorah Mormont {{since the}} {{beginning}} of the series, also spoke about his participation in the episode, with his farewell to Daenerys Targaryen, noting [...] "They've got a worried actor on their hands. For any actor on the show, most of the time we're just thinking, [...] "Please keep me alive!" [...] I've been very lucky to be a part of the show, right back to the pilot. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> out in the madness of greyscale, then I'll have thought I've done very well. It's been a complete treat to be a part of the show. They're a lovely group of people. But the greyscale has definitely got this actor worried, I'll be honest about that." ...|$|E
500|$|In interviews, Frobisher {{elicited}} the students' reasoning. One fifth-year {{decided that}} 0 was even {{because it was}} found on the 2 times table. A couple of fourth-years realized that zero can be split into equal parts. Another fourth-year reasoned [...] "1 is odd and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> down it's even." [...] The interviews also revealed the misconceptions behind incorrect responses. A second-year was [...] "quite convinced" [...] that zero was odd, on the basis that [...] "it is the first number you count". A fourth-year referred to 0 as [...] "none" [...] and thought that it was neither odd nor even, since [...] "it's not a number". In another study, Annie Keith observed a class of 15 second grade students who convinced each other that zero was an even number based on even-odd alternation and on the possibility of splitting a group of zero things in two equal groups.|$|E

500|$|At {{the age of}} 52, {{he began}} to revive his career and started taking acting classes, {{something}} he had not thought about after being cast in Neighbours. He described his age, unknown status and willingness {{to work for a}} relatively low fee as being his main assets for getting work in America. His drama teacher, who he has remained with ever since, told him [...] "that you might want to play great roles, but truth is you will get cast as a specific type. Just work out your type. The others in the class said I was a bit Anthony Hopkins and a bit Sean Connery and that went into my head. I thought <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> for roles those guys would go for I'm more likely to get them." [...] The first role he was offered was a part in a series called Sign of Life, a show about a rock band, which eventually fell through. Dale only received a couple of auditions during his first year in America, but his break came when he was cast as the South African Al Patterson in four episodes of ER. Since then, Dale has been [...] "busier than ever". He has appeared in many television series including guest appearances on The West Wing, Torchwood, The Lone Gunmen, Californication, and The Practice. Many of these have been recurring roles, such as the part of Tom Morrow in JAG and its spin-off NCIS, as well as appearing in three episodes, including the series finale, of The X-Files, playing the [...] "Toothpick Man". He played the recurring role of Vice President of the United States Jim Prescott for seven episodes of the second season of 24, a part which was originally supposed to be a single scene. Dale had recurring roles in the serial Midnight Man and the Australian series Sea Patrol in 2008. He also had recurring parts on Undercovers, Entourage as John Ellis, the fictional owner of Warner Bros., and the British series Moving Wallpaper as a fictional version of himself. He had a recurring role as King George in the series Once Upon a Time, and Emmett in Hot in Cleveland, before joining the main cast of Dominion in 2014, playing General Edward Riesen.|$|E

2500|$|Late in {{the regular}} season, on 23 March 2009, Hossa {{was quoted as saying}} he would like to sign a {{long-term}} career deal with the Red Wings for the upcoming season. He also stated he is willing to take less money to continue to play for Detroit, saying, [...] "I know <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> somewhere else, I could have more, but I'm willing to take less to stay here. Hopefully things work out." [...] Hossa's comments came just several months after the Red Wings signed forward Henrik Zetterberg to a 12-year contract extension.|$|E

"He (Steve) became {{another person}} {{to cope with}} the pressures, he would say things like, [...] "Please tell me that you'll leave me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> on tour again because if you say that I’ll have {{justification}} not to go, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> and have to be that other person again I'll just go mad." [...] This would be said in a moment of truth but the next day had changed his mind and he'd be up and off.... He was married to his music and I didn't mind that especially in the early years when he would play me new songs on an acoustic guitar but what didn't make me happy was {{when he was in the}} home studio, out of his brain, trying to come up with the next album because he was being pressurised into it. He would just disappear into the studio for three or four days at a time. He never slept and there would be all sorts of strange people in there with him. It was a crazy business and even the nicest people get mixed up. All sorts of chemicals were presented to him and he became addicted to them in the end. It was drugs that destroyed our relationship. Before the home studio was built Beehive Cottage was our sanctuary, afterwards it just became his workplace." [...] – Jenny Rylance ...|$|E
2500|$|Ullman {{contends that}} her impersonations are played with great admiration and affection. [...] "I hope {{they take it}} in the right spirit!" [...] One person {{impersonated}} who's reacted positively to her portrayal as a kleptomaniac Dame who wreaks havoc on an unsuspecting public is actress Judi Dench. Dench's daughter, Finty Williams, posted a clip of Ullman playing her mother on Facebook with the caption, [...] "brilliant, just brilliant." [...] Critics also praised the impersonation, with one writer saying: [...] "Her impersonation of Dench is so spot on that, {{for a second or}} two, you can't be sure she is not the real deal. Her performance easily transcends the make-up thanks to her mastery of posture, gesture and facial control as well as pitch- perfect vocals." [...] While filming on location, on-lookers asked if they were filming a James Bond film after catching Ullman in character. At the 36th London Critics' Circle Film Awards, Judi Dench introduced herself as [...] "Tracey Ullman." [...] In April 2017, while speaking to BBC Radio 4's Front Row, Dench commented on Ullman's portrayal, saying that she doted on it, and dubbed Ullman as brilliant. [...] "But I get into trouble now <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> into a shop with a bag over my arm [...] A man came up to me in M the other day and said to me, 'I've got my eye on you'." ...|$|E

2500|$|In November 2004, Dobson was {{described}} by the online magazine Slate as [...] "America's most influential evangelical leader." [...] The article explained [...] "Forget Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, who in their dotage have marginalized themselves with gaffes... Dobson is now America's most influential evangelical leader, with a following reportedly {{greater than that of}} either Falwell or Robertson at his peak... Dobson may have delivered Bush his victories in Ohio and Florida." [...] Further, [...] "He's already leveraging his new power. When a thank-you call came from the White House, Dobson issued the staffer a blunt warning that Bush 'needs to be more aggressive' about pressing the religious right's pro-life, anti-gay rights agenda, or it would 'pay a price in four years.'...Dobson has sometimes complained that the Republican Party may take the votes of social conservatives for granted, and has suggested that evangelicals may withhold support from the GOP if the party does not more strongly support conservative family issues: [...] "Does the Republican Party want our votes, no string attached — to court us every two years, and then to say, 'Don't call me, I'll call you' — and not to care about the moral law of the universe? ... Is that what they want? Is that the way the system works? Is this the way it's going to be? If it is, I'm gone, and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>go,</b> I will do everything I can to take as many people with me as possible." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Taishi Ci {{finally reached}} Luoyang after {{travelling}} day and night, {{he saw the}} provincial administration's courier near the city gate. He approached him and asked, [...] "Sir, are you delivering a document?" [...] The courier replied, [...] "Yes." [...] Taishi Ci asked again, [...] "Where is the document?" [...] The courier replied, [...] "In the carriage." [...] Taishi Ci said, [...] "Are you sure there is no mistake in the addressee's details on the document? Let me see it." [...] The courier {{did not know that}} Taishi Ci was from Donglai Commandery so he showed him the letter. Taishi Ci took out a knife and destroyed the letter. The courier started shouting, [...] "This man destroyed my document!" [...] Taishi Ci pulled him into the carriage and said, [...] "If you didn't show me the document, I wouldn't have been able to destroy it. Regardless of the consequences, neither of us can say he is not responsible for what happened. I suggest we remain silent and escape. By doing this, we can avoid punishment and keep our heads. Otherwise, both of us will be executed." [...] The courier asked, [...] "Your master sent you to destroy this document. Now that you have accomplished your mission, why do you still need to go on the run?" [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "He ordered me to only check whether the document has been delivered. However, I went too far and ended up destroying the document. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> back, I am afraid that my master will blame me, so I suggest we escape together." [...] The courier was persuaded by Taishi Ci so they fled from Luoyang together.|$|E
