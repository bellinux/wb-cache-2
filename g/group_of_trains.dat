50|$|Even so, {{the opening}} of the Naples-Formia-Rome railway in 1927 {{transformed}} the station into an important rail junction. For that reason, it was fitted with additional platforms and greatly expanded. In order to offer a better service on the Sparanise-Gaeta line, two types of trains were created for that line: first, a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>trains</b> travelling along the Formia-Sparanise section, and secondly, a shuttle service between Formia and Gaeta.|$|E

30|$|To {{evaluate}} the working {{of the model}} in the actual traffic scenario, we conducted several experiments for a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>trains</b> with different characteristics representing the mixed traffic. The system deals with two kinds of parameters associated with the track: operator defined which is static and deterministic such as the maximum allowable speed on the track, turnout restricted speed. The other arising in real time is dynamic and random, e.g. speed restrictions due to track faults, train equipment faults {{or any kind of}} obstacle on the track. Due to the static and dynamic parameters, trains’ normal running is affected. However, as the static parameters are deterministic, the system has prior knowledge about this. The system takes care of such restrictions while estimating moving authority for the trains. On the other hand, the occurrence of dynamic parameters is known at runtime and this is challenging while estimating moving authority for the trains. In our work, both scenarios have been taken to test the overall responsiveness of the proposed system. The results obtained are categorized into two parts: one showing the relationship between speed and location to represent the safe moving authority provided to the trains for their safe running in case of any fault scenario identified in runtime, and second, the relationship between time and location to represent the collision-free running of the trains in the same scenario. For the purpose of describing the behavioural analysis, we considered only one instance from several simulation experiments for each fault type.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{previously}} shown {{that it is possible}} to modify the expressed repertoire of a given individual using idiotypic manipulation. For example, A/J mice respond to arsonate challenge by synthesizing a dominant idiotype, CRIA, whereas BALB/c mice do not. However, after treatment with rabbit polyclonal anti-CRIA antibodies (Ab 2 or anti-idiotypic antibodies) and arsonate, BALB/c mice are able to synthesize a CRIA-like idiotype. To determine whether this modification of repertoire is dependent on the immunoglobulin loci (Ig-h, κ), we have analyzed the anti-arsonate response after anti-idiotypic treatment of three strains of mice (C 58, C. C 58, AKR), chosen because they are among a small <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>trains</b> which express Kappa V regions not seen in other strains. There are also L chains lacking in these strains which are expressed in other mice. The C 58 and C. C 58 strains share the same Ig-h locus (Ig-ha) with BALB/c mice but C. C 58 are congenic mice, that express the κ loci on a BALB/c genetic background. AKR mice express the Ig-hd haplotype. AKR, C 58 and C. C 58 do not produce CRIA positive antibodies in response to arsonate; a defect which {{has been previously}} mapped to the κ locus. These three strains of mice (C 58, C. C 58 and AKR) were treated with rabbit anti-CRIA and boosted with Ars-KLH. The results show that after such treatment, the C. C 58 mice were able to express CRIA-like antibodies which are serologically identical to those of BALB/c. © 1987. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} {{factors that may}} {{influence}} running economy. One factor that has consistently been observed to influence the energy expenditure (and thus economy) during running, is training status. Well-trained runners are often {{found to be significantly}} more economical than untrained individuals. Also, performance level has been observed to influence the energy expenditure of running at a given speed, even within <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>trained</b> runners. For example, elite runners are often more economical than sub-elite or average runners. This suggests that running economy, or the energy cost of running at a given submaximal speed, may be a valid predictor of performance especially within homogeneous <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>trained</b> runners. There is also evidence that intense endurance training can improve economy within an individual.|$|R
