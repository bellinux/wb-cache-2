She was featured in an article published in Life magazine, due to the response to a part of <b>her</b> <b>speech</b> that criticized Senator Brooke. She also appeared on Irv Kupcinet's nationally syndicated television talk show as well as in Illinois and New England newspapers. That summer, she worked her way across Alaska, washing dishes in Mount McKinley National Park and sliming salmon in a fish processing cannery in Valdez (which fired her and shut down overnight when she complained about unhealthful conditions).|$|E

5|$|The {{child would}} grow up healthy, but {{with some of the}} {{behaviours}} of a pig. She would eat from a silver trough, and speak only in grunts or with a grunting sound to <b>her</b> <b>speech.</b> The only child of her parents, she would stand to inherit a large fortune, but her parents would be concerned about what would become of her after their death.

5|$|Feeling {{that her}} {{employment}} opportunities were being blocked, that same year, on 19 January 1959, Johnson asked {{to address the}} members of the Bahamian House of the Assembly, but was told she could only speak after the session adjourned, to which she agreed. In <b>her</b> <b>speech,</b> she pointed out that a petition had been submitted to the House in 1958 for suffrage, which Members had claimed showed only 13 petitioners and 529 signatories. She provided mimeographed copies showing the actual number was 2,829 people and included people from Abaco, Andros, Cat Island, Eleuthera, Exuma, Grand Bahama, Long Island, and New Providence. She went on to complain that women were being taxed without representation and reasoned that should the vote not be extended to them, they should no longer have to pay taxes. She insisted that women were working members of society and were ready, willing, and able to participate as full citizens. Though the Members of Parliament were impressed with the speech, they did nothing.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of Anderson's childhood, the Queales lived at 56 Villa Street, in a house abutting Yeronga Memorial Park. On {{the opposite side of}} the park was Yeronga State School, the school at which Anderson began her formal education. In spite of its reputation as one of the best state schools in Queensland at the time, Yeronga State School rapidly became a site of dread and frustration for Anderson, who suffered from a speech impediment that caused strife for her in the classroom. Anderson's speech impediment (as well as her occasional flirtations with truancy) became such a hindrance to her education that her parents decided that she was to be home-schooled by her mother for a year, while attending weekly speech therapy sessions in the city. In spite of these efforts, Anderson's slight stammer was to stay with her for the rest of her life; several observers commented that the impediment lent <b>her</b> <b>speech</b> a careful and deliberate air. Following her primary school education, Anderson attended high school at Brisbane State High School. Upon graduation, she attended Brisbane Technical College Art School.|$|E
