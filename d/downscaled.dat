30|$|While {{statistical}} <b>downscaling</b> and dynamical <b>downscaling</b> {{methods are}} widely used in climatology research, both face drawbacks that limit their applicability. Recently, the approach of combining dynamical <b>downscaling</b> with statistical <b>downscaling</b> has been explored. Dynamical-statistical <b>downscaling</b> is a blended technique, where an RCM model is initially adopted to <b>downscale</b> the GCM output followed by the application of statistical formulas to further <b>downscale</b> the RCM output to a higher resolution. Dynamical <b>downscaling</b> methods can utilize the advantages of RCM to provide better predictors for use in statistical <b>downscaling</b> (Guyennon et al. 2013). Berg et al. (2015) demonstrated this promising method by using a hybrid of the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model with the empirical orthogonal function to effectively forecast precipitation changes. In other research, Walton et al. (2015) introduced a new dynamical-statistical <b>downscaling</b> method by coupling WRF with principal component analysis. The statistical-dynamical <b>downscaling</b> method is another approach for blending techniques where dynamical <b>downscaling</b> is applied after a selected statistical <b>downscale.</b> While statistical-dynamical <b>downscaling</b> is a more complex blending technique, it is computationally less expensive. These methods use a statistical approach to refine the GCM outputs into a few characteristic states, which can be later used with the RCM models (Fuentes and Heimann 2000).|$|R

However, the relatively low spatial resolution of GCMs outputs is unsatisfactory for the local-scale climate impact assessments. Compared to dynamic <b>downscaling,</b> the statistical <b>downscaling</b> approach is widely used to bridge this gap. In this review paper, recent advances in three fundamental statistical <b>downscaling</b> approaches (regression methods, weather type approaches and stochastic weather generators) were presented firstly. Furthermore, uncertainties in statistical <b>downscaling</b> were discussed. The developments and applications of statistical <b>downscaling</b> in China were then summarized. The review study concludes that the comparisons and combinations of statistical <b>downscaling</b> and dynamic <b>downscaling</b> approaches, <b>downscaling</b> of extreme events and uncertainty analysis in statistical <b>downscaling</b> will become the mainstream of future related studies...|$|R
30|$|The {{expected}} results when adopting WRF-ANN over WRF include a comparable <b>downscaling</b> quality with reduced computational load and time. Since the step of <b>downscaling</b> from 30 - to 6 -km resolution using ANN gives results instantly, {{the advantage of}} using WRF-ANN methods was measured by comparing the time consumption needed by WRF to <b>downscale</b> rainfall to 30 or to 6  km. Our measured results indicate that WRF <b>downscaling</b> to 6 -km resolution took 9.3 times longer than <b>downscaling</b> to 30 -km resolution. Rainfall <b>downscaling</b> using the WRF-ANN method can therefore save up to approximately 89 % of the computational cost, as compared to <b>downscaling</b> using WRF alone.|$|R

As such it has a typical tank layout: steering compartment at the front, fighting compartment in the centre and the engine compartment in the back. Although the Type 62 light tank is similar to the Type 59 main battle tank in appearance, it has a smaller hull and turret. The Type 62 light tank was given a four-man crew configuration, with the driver seated on the left hand side of the front of the hull, the tank commander and gunner seated {{on the left side of}} the turret in a tandem formation and the loader on the right hand side of the rear of the turret. The driver's hatch is located on the left hand side of the front of the hull, directly in front of the turret. It has three periscope vision blocks which provide the driver with forward vision. The centre vision block may be removed and replaced with a low-light periscope with a 50 m vision range. The left hand side turret hatch also has a periscope vision block on top of it and is most probably used by the commander. There is another periscope vision block in the front of each turret hatch. Apart from his usual duty of reloading the gun after it has been fired by the gunner, the loader is also responsible for operating the 12.7mm Type 54 anti-aircraft heavy machine gun mounted on the turret's roof.|$|E
30|$|Over the years, the {{applicability}} of dynamical <b>downscaling</b> has significantly improved owing to the continuous development of computing technology and advances in numerical models. Even though the use of dynamical <b>downscaling</b> has become easier, {{it continues to be}} an extremely demanding method that requires considerable computational cost, simulation time, and output storage. Statistical <b>downscaling</b> is an alternative to dynamical <b>downscaling</b> for high-resolution climate <b>downscaling</b> that can overcome the drawbacks of dynamical <b>downscaling</b> methods. Statistical <b>downscaling</b> takes into account the empirical, spatial, and temporal relationships between large-scale climate indicators (predictors) and local-scale climate variables (predictands) and are trained on a historical period. Subsequently, these relationships are presumed to hold in the future, where they can be used to determine future predictands. Statistical <b>downscaling</b> methods are computationally inexpensive and significantly faster than dynamical <b>downscaling,</b> so they can be applied for even higher resolutions, up to station-scale. Since statistical <b>downscaling</b> methods rely on the assumption of an unchanged statistical relationship, they require long historical climate observation data for validation, which is not always available for every region. In contrast, dynamical <b>downscaling</b> operates based on physical realism with complex local processes, which allows it to map important fine-scale variations in climate that otherwise might not be included (Salathé Jr et al. 2008; Pierce et al. 2012; Walton et al. 2017).|$|R

30|$|The hybrid dynamical-statistical <b>downscaling</b> {{approach}} {{is an effort}} to combine the ability of dynamical <b>downscaling</b> to resolve fine-scale climate changes with the low computational cost of statistical <b>downscaling.</b> In this study, we propose a dynamical-statistical <b>downscaling</b> technique by incorporating a regional climate model (RCM) with artificial neural networks (ANN) to <b>downscale</b> rainfall information over the Red River Delta in Vietnam. First, dynamical <b>downscaling</b> was performed with an RCM driven by the reanalysis to produce nested 30 - and 6 -km resolution simulations. Subsequently, the 6 -km simulation was compared to rain gauge data to examine the ability of the RCM to reproduce known climate conditions. Then, in the statistical <b>downscaling</b> step, the ANN was trained to predict rainfall in the 6 -km domain based on weather predictors in the 30 -km simulation. Statistical <b>downscaling</b> results were compared with the original output from RCM to determine the accuracy of the coupling method. A bias correction method to locate no-rainfall events in the ANN <b>downscaling</b> result was also developed to enhance the credibility of the final results. The outcomes of this study illustrate that ANN can produce RCM-like results (r[*]>[*] 0.9) {{at a fraction of the}} cost, with an 89 % reduction in the required computational power.|$|R

40|$|Aim: Species atlases {{provide an}} {{economical}} way {{to collect data}} with national coverage, but are typically too coarse-grained to monitor fine-grain patterns in rarity, distribution and abundance. We test the performance of ten <b>downscaling</b> models in extrapolating occupancy across two orders of magnitude. To provide a greater challenge to <b>downscaling</b> models, we extend previous <b>downscaling</b> tests with plants to highly mobile insect taxa (Odonata) with a life history that is tied to freshwater bodies for reproduction. We investigate the species-level correlates of predictive accuracy for the best performing model to understand whether traits driving spatial structure can cause interspecific variation in <b>downscaling</b> success. Location: Mainland Britain. Methods: Occupancy data for 38 British Odonata species were extracted from the Dragonfly Recording Network (DRN). Occupancy at grains ≥ 100 km 2 was used as training data to parameterize ten <b>downscaling</b> models. Predicted occupancy at the 25, 4 and 1 km 2 grains was compared to observed data at corresponding grains. Model predictive error was evaluated across species and grains. Main conclusions: The Hui model gave the most accurate <b>downscaling</b> predictions across 114 species:grain combinations and the best predictions for 14 of the 38 species, despite being the only model using information at a single spatial grain. The occupancy–area relationship was sigmoidal in shape for most species. Species' distribution type and dispersal ability explained {{over half of the}} variation in <b>downscaling</b> predictive error at the species level. Species with a climatic range limit in Britain were poorly predicted compared with other distribution types, and high dispersal ability was associated with relatively poor <b>downscaling</b> predictions. Our results suggest that <b>downscaling</b> models, using widely available coarse-grain atlas data, provide reasonable estimates of fine-grain occupancy, even for insect taxa with strong spatial structure.

Thus far, the nature, the methods, {{and a number of}} crucial issues concerning the use of dynamic <b>downscaling</b> are still not well understood. The most important issue is whether, and if so, under what conditions dynamic <b>downscaling</b> is really capable of adding more information at different scales compared to the GCM or reanalysis that imposes lateral boundary conditions (LBCs) to the RCMs. There are controversies regarding the <b>downscaling</b> ability. In this review paper we present several factors that have consistently demonstrated strong impact on dynamic <b>downscaling</b> ability in intraseasonal and seasonal simulations/predictions and future projection. Those factors include setting of the RCM experiment (e. g. imposed LBC quality, domain size and position, LBC coupling, and horizontal resolution); as well as physical processes, mainly convective schemes and vegetation and soil processes that include initializations, vegetation specifications, and planetary boundary layer and surface coupling. These studies indicate that RCMs have <b>downscaling</b> ability in some aspects but only under certain conditions.
