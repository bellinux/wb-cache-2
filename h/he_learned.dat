5|$|The less-prominent women {{mentioned}} in the play are subordinated as well, as they are only described through {{the men of the}} play. Most of what is said about Sycorax, for example, is said by Prospero. Further, Stephen Orgel notes that Prospero has never met Sycorax – all <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> about her <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> from Ariel. According to Orgel, Prospero's suspicion of women makes him an unreliable source of information. Orgel suggests that he is sceptical of female virtue in general, citing his ambiguous remark about his wife's fidelity.|$|E

5|$|From {{the start}} of his Cairo posting Clarke learned the art of {{deception}} by trial and error. From mistakes during Camilla <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> to focus on what he wanted the enemy to do rather than on what he wanted them to think. From another early operation (K-Shell, the spreading of rumours about a new Allied super-shell which eventually petered out after the media picked up the story), <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> the value of conducting deception only when there was a clear objective, rather than because it was possible. From Bastion he discovered the difficulty of running a large deception on a short timescale. From these lessons Clarke evolved his principles of deception.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe premise {{from which}} we started our study implies that the best impact of {{teaching}} {{is represented by the}} involvement of the main sensory systems. Thus, the person who learns has to see what <b>he</b> <b>learns</b> (maps, graphics), has to hear what <b>he</b> <b>learns</b> (the teacher's voice) and has to experiment what <b>he</b> <b>learns</b> (by practice). Our point of view is that the favourite sensory system determines the learning style. In order to be efficient, education should represent a multisensory experience because what motivates learning is feeling in a good mood. A challenge that we will develop in the following lines...|$|R

At the Kangayan Primary School, Ramanujan performed well.

Not waiting for Johnson's response—which never came—Blackburn returned to the U.S., arriving in Louisville on September 25, 1867, en route to New Orleans.
