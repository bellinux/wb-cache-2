40|$|This paper grows from {{doctoral}} {{research on}} gender mainstreaming in the Republic of Ireland. Interviews with equality policy-makers revealed that initial investment in childcare, (Â£ 1 m in 1993), {{was used by}} policy-makers to establish gender equality as a legitimate aspect of the Irish policy-making system. This paper asks to what extent does childcare policy interact with gender policy to create effective institutional space for women and children? Policy-makers incremental approach to policy-making meant that the identification of childcare as an economic issue gave those interested in gender equality policy an opportunity to gain funding, establish links with NGOs and international organisations, and begin to build a coherent policy base for gender equality. Significantly, innovative policy-makers at the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform identified the potential of childcare to become a mainstream concern, and built a reputation as pragmatic egalitarians within the policy-making community. This paper investigates {{the extent to which}} childcare policy can create bureaucratic space for gender issues.

We draw {{on the concept of}} policy frame to analyze the politics of <b>family</b> <b>policy</b> reform in Switzerland.

This fairly singular approach to <b>family</b> <b>policy</b> is ironic given that Canada {{does not have a}} nationally-coordinated <b>family</b> <b>policy.</b> The development of a national <b>family</b> <b>policy</b> has been hampered by Canada’s decentralized governmental structure (i. e., federal and provincial, as well as territorial, governments) and other factors such as diverse geography and different traditions (e. g., a tradition of common law in English Canada, and civil law in Quebec).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{emphasizes the}} comparative aspect of <b>family</b> <b>policy,</b> with a regional focus on post-communist Europe. Following {{the turmoil of}} transition, many social welfare programs were transformed and often scaled back. <b>Family</b> <b>policies,</b> however, were largely carried through the initial period of transformation, despite the economic difficulties and the dramatic {{decline in birth rates}} in a course of several years. This study was inspired by the seeming contradiction between falling birth rates and increasing generosity of <b>family</b> <b>policy</b> provisions across the former communist European countries. This dissertation uses original data, which includes levels of benefit provision as well as national political and economic characteristics, and views on immigration from 1990 to 2010. Contemporary scholarship emphasizes the gender equality aspect of <b>family</b> <b>policies</b> while understating the political and policy implications of the state’s goal of maintaining stable populations. I address this shortcoming by assessing the interconnectedness of the <b>family</b> <b>policies</b> and fertility rates and by acknowledging the current rise of xenophobia that stems from the increasing transparency of borders. I utilize both quantitative and qualitative methodology to support my argument. Chapters 2 and 3 of the study present the time-series cross-sectional analysis of the demographic, socio-economic, political, and policy influences on fertility rates and <b>family</b> <b>policies,</b> respectively, in fourteen countries. Chapter 4 is a case-study of Russia, which hosts the largest share of immigrants in Europe and provides generous family benefits. 	My central argument – and finding – is that anti-immigrant sentiment is an important consideration for <b>family</b> <b>policy</b> considerations. I find that xenophobia is a meaningful predictor of <b>family</b> <b>policy</b> generosity in the CEE, especially in the countries where the proportion of foreign-born population exceeds five percent. I also find that party politics matters for the generosity of <b>family</b> <b>policies.</b> Despite conventional expectations, I find that Right parties have been more instrumental in increasing <b>family</b> <b>policies</b> in the CEE. I argue that <b>family</b> <b>policies</b> fit well within the conservative party policies of the traditional male breadwinner family model, which has replaced the former communist paradigm of full labor participation among men and women.

Alarmed by recent social and demographic chan-ges, the Korean government has started to establish explicit <b>family</b> <b>policies</b> from the mid 2000 s.
