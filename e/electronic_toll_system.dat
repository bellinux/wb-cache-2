Users can activate an A25 client account at www.A25.com and install a transponder (electronic sticker) on their vehicle's windshield. Crossing the bridge without a transponder triggers the system to automatically {{take a picture of}} the vehicle's license plate and send an invoice by mail. Users must settle the bridge-crossing toll and the applicable administration fees in the prescribed time, otherwise additional collection charges may be added to the toll.|$|E

The Halifax-Dartmouth Bridge Commission is exploring the idea of moving entirely to electronic tolls to avoid handling tokens or cash. The A. Murray MacKay Bridge is the only harbour bridge which permits semi-trailers and large trucks. Pedestrians and bicycles are not permitted on the A.

The original plans called for a freeway to be built; however, the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) determined that funds to build the freeway were not available, and that the road would not be built until 2033 using traditional funding methods.

The toll fee (Maut) has to be paid to legally access the Austrian Autobahns at any time except the Autobahns listed below. On routes which are more costly to maintain, mostly Alpine routes with tunnels—sections of the Pyhrn Autobahn, the Tauern Autobahn (Tauern Tunnel) and the Karawanken Autobahn (Karawanken Tunnel), as well as the Brenner Autobahn—a toll should be paid which is collected at time of use via toll plazas and therefore drivers do not need to have a vignette to use these Autobahns.|$|E

40|$|In some {{segments}} <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> <b>system</b> {{based on}} satellite technology {{is quite different}} from the toll payment procedures that we know today. The new system is based on an intelligent device in a vehicle and on a number of virtual billing and control points that cover the road network. Main advantage of the new system is simultaneously tolling which base on the principle 'Pay as you drive', without stopping or slowing down your vehicle. That kind of <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> <b>system</b> will probably be prescribed on the whole territory of the European Union (EU). In scope of that EU already started to build a new satellite based navigation system named Galileo. From technical point of view developing a pan-European satellite based <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> <b>system</b> does not represents a big problem. Complexity of the system increase when we need to assure system compatible with EU directive 2002 / 58 /EC, which defines that information about person location is personal information and should be treated as that. Protecting person's personal information is one of fundamental human rights in EU. This means that the new <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> <b>system</b> must assure users anonymity by preventing user's geographic location reveal. Main design and basic principals that complies with EU requirements have been prepared by expert group 9, which was established by European Directorate-General Energy and Transport (DG-TREN). Suggested solution was proposed in MISTER document [2]. In my dissertation I have develop a working prototype of proposed solution. Main goal of this dissertation was to verify its basic principles and to define software and hardware requirements for vehicles intelligent device that will be capable to support proposed <b>electronic</b> <b>toll</b> <b>system.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the <b>Electronic</b> <b>toll</b> <b>system</b> as a {{regulatory}} action for traffic management. All sorts of transportation have detrimental effects on the environment and ultimately the public health. Therefore, the mail aim of the thesis is {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} electronic toll systems as a tool for traffic regulation within cities. To this end a comparison of available technologies by several criteria is presented and optimal solutions including the order of preference of specific technologies are suggested. Modern electronic toll systems enable variable setting of the toll amounts to reflect specific needs of particular towns and cities such as reduction of vehicle entry, noise or emissions as well as congestions of traffic and other issues.
