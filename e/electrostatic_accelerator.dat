50|$|The Tandem Van de Graaff is an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>accelerator</b> {{facility}} at Brookhaven National Laboratory. It {{was built in}} 1970, and was, at the time, the world's largest <b>electrostatic</b> <b>accelerator</b> facility. It can provide researchers with beams of more than 40 different types of ions that have been completely stripped of their electrons, ranging from hydrogen to iron. The facility consists of two 15 million volt electrostatic accelerators, each about 24 meters long.Currently, the Tandem Van de Graaff serves as the ion source for the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The ions are generated in the Tandem Van de Graaff and they then travel through a 700-meter-long tunnel called the Tandem to Booster (TtB) Line that delivers the ions to the Alternating Gradient Booster that then delivers the ions to the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS), which accelerates the ions further before final entry into RHIC.|$|E
50|$|The {{two main}} types of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>accelerator</b> are the Cockcroft-Walton accelerator, {{which uses a}} diode-capacitor voltage {{multiplier}} to produce high voltage, and the Van de Graaff accelerator, which uses a moving fabric belt to carry charge to the high voltage electrode. Although electrostatic accelerators accelerate particles along a straight line, the term linear accelerator is more often used for accelerators that employ oscillating rather than static electric fields.|$|E
5000|$|... beam optics: the {{precursor}} ion beam is generated in a multigrid <b>electrostatic</b> <b>accelerator,</b> having 1280 apertures {{in each of}} the 7 grids composing it. Since the overall width of the beam along the beam drift (about 25 meters) is due to the optics of each of the 1280 beamlets, the grid alignment and the disturbances produced by magnetic fields and electrostatic error fields are to be carefully verified.|$|E
50|$|The name 'tandem' {{originates}} {{from this}} dual-use {{of the same}} high voltage, although tandems may also be named in the same style of conventional <b>electrostatic</b> <b>accelerators</b> based on the method of charging the terminal.|$|R
5000|$|Most often <b>electrostatic</b> <b>accelerators</b> are {{arranged}} in a horizontal line. However, some tandems may have a [...] "U" [...] shape, and in principle the beam can be turned to any direction with a magnetic dipole at the terminal. Some <b>electrostatic</b> <b>accelerators</b> {{are arranged}} vertically, where either the ion source or, {{in the case of}} a [...] "U" [...] shaped vertical tandem, the terminal, is at the top of a tower. A tower arrangement can be a way to save space, and also the beam line connecting to the terminal made of glass rings can take some advantage of gravity as a natural source of compression.|$|R

50|$|It is not {{possible}} to make every element into an anion easily, so it is very rare for tandems to accelerate any noble gases, although KrF− and XeF− have been successfully produced and accelerated with a tandem.2 It is not uncommon to make compounds in order to get anions, however, and TiH2 might be extracted as TiH− and used to produce a proton beam, because these simple, and often weakly bound chemicals, will be broken apart at the terminal stripper foil. Anion ion beam production was a major subject of study for tandem accelerator application, and one can find recipes and yields for most elements in the Negative Ion Cookbook.3 Tandems can also be operated in terminal mode, where they function like a single-ended <b>electrostatic</b> <b>accelerator,</b> which is a more common and practical way to make beams of noble gases.|$|E

50|$|<b>Electrostatic</b> <b>accelerators</b> {{are often}} {{confused}} with linear accelerators {{simply because they}} can (but do not always) accelerate particles in a line. As we can see even early in their history, accelerators were named in some way referring to the method or type of acceleration. Terminal accelerators pre-date both linear accelerator technology and the nomenclature, {{so it would be}} confusing and incorrect to categorize them with a newer technology which is quite different. Linear accelerators use an array of oscillating electric fields, historically arranged in a line, but nothing would prevent a person from using magnets in between the columns of linear accelerators to form some other geometric shape. Oscillating field accelerators do not actually produce beams of particles, but rather packets of particles, unlike <b>electrostatic</b> <b>accelerators</b> which can have a beam current that is constant in time. Thus, the naming scheme for accelerators is based on the method of acceleration, or the physics, and not its geometry, which can be a point of confusion. In fact, it was the oscillating field design of the linear accelerator which inspired Lawrence to construct the cyclotron, which accelerates particles in a spiral, thus taking up a considerably smaller amount of space. A linear accelerator has more in common with a cyclotron than an <b>electrostatic</b> terminal <b>accelerator.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Generally, {{negative}} ions {{are created}} (atoms are ionized) in an ion source. In fortunate cases this already allows {{the suppression of}} an unwanted isobar, which does not form negative ions (as 14N {{in the case of}} 14C measurements). The pre-accelerated ions are usually separated by a first mass spectrometer of sector-field type and enter an electrostatic [...] "tandem accelerator". This is a large nuclear particle accelerator based on the principle of a Tandem van de Graaff Accelerator operating at 0.2 to many million volts with two stages operating in tandem to accelerate the particles. At the connecting point between the two stages, the ions change charge from negative to positive by passing through a thin layer of matter ("stripping", either gas or a thin carbon foil). Molecules will break apart in this stripping stage. The complete suppression of molecular isobars (e.g. 13CH&minus; in the case of 14C measurements) is one reason for the exceptional abundance sensitivity of AMS. Additionally, the impact strips off several of the ion's electrons, converting it into a positively charged ion. In {{the second half of the}} accelerator, the now positively charged ion is accelerated away from the highly positive centre of the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>accelerator</b> which previously attracted the negative ion. When the ions leave the accelerator they are positively charged and are moving at several percent of the speed of light. In a second stage of mass spectrometer, the fragments from the molecules are separated from the ions of interest. This spectrometer may consist of magnetic or electric sectors, and so-called velocity selectors, which utilizes both electric fields and magnetic fields. After this stage, no background is left, unless a stable (atomic) isobar forming negative ions exists (e.g. 36S if measuring 36Cl), which is not suppressed at all by the setup described so far. Thanks to the high energy of the ions, these can be separated by methods borrowed from nuclear physics, like degrader foils and gas-filled magnets. Individual ions are finally detected by single-ion counting (with silicon surface-barrier detectors, ionization chambers, and/or time-of-flight telescopes). Thanks to the high energy of the ions, these detectors can provide additional identification of background isobars by nuclear-charge determination.|$|E
