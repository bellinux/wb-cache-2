5|$|Historian Thomas Vogel opines that Rommel {{was not a}} Nazi, if {{one uses}} the {{definition}} the Nazis themselves used, considering that although he did everything <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> make his country strong again, he showed no support towards the racial policies or {{other aspects of the}} regime.|$|E
5|$|In Legacy of the Void, {{not long}} after his {{ascension}} to the throne, Korhal {{and the rest of}} the Dominion are assaulted by Moebius Foundation under control of the fallen Xel'Naga, Amon. Alongside Raynor, he does everything <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> save his people. When Artanis arrives, he aids Raynor and Valerian to repel the Moebius Foundation on Korhal. After Amon has been banished into the Void, Valerian allows Raynor to take the Dominion Fleet to Ulnar in order to help Kerrigan and Artanis to defeat Amon once for all. After Amon's defeat, Valerian has turned the Terran Dominion into a government of peace and prosperity.|$|E
5|$|Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil was crowned as the 13thking in the Copán dynasty in July695. He oversaw {{both the}} apogee of Copán's {{achievements}} and {{also one of}} the city's most catastrophic political disasters. During his reign, the sculptural style of the city evolved into the full in-the-round sculpture characteristic of Copán. In AD718, Copán attacked and defeated the unidentified site of Xkuy, recording its burning on an unusual stone cylinder. In AD724 Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil installed K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat as a vassal on the throne of Quiriguá. Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil was confident enough <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> rank his city among the four most powerful states in the Maya region, together with Tikal, Calakmul and Palenque, as recorded on StelaA. In contrast to his predecessor, Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil concentrated his monuments in the site core of the Copán; his first was StelaJ, dated to AD702 and erected at the eastern entrance to the city.|$|E

Virendra is not happy when Chandan informs his family about his decision to help Sunaina. Virendra takes away the agreement documents between Trishna and Sunaina from Chandan’s cupboard when he sleeps.|$|R
50|$|The {{power of}} the purse's {{earliest}} examples in a modern sense occurred in the English Parliament, which gained the exclusive <b>power</b> <b>to</b> authorise taxes and thus could control the nation's cash flow. Through this power, Parliament slowly subverted the executive strength of the crown; King Charles II was limited <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> engage <b>in</b> various war efforts by a refusal by Parliament to authorise further taxes and by his inability to secure loans from foreign nations, making him much less powerful.|$|R

25|$|After a {{spell of}} poverty during which {{his wife was}} expecting their first child, Wright spent two weeks in Chelmsford Prison for failing to pay fines for driving without tax or insurance.

25|$|On 19July 1903, Younghusband {{arrived at}} Gangtok, {{the capital city}} of the Indian state of Sikkim, where John Claude White was Political Officer, to prepare for his mission. White was unhappy with his {{secondment}} to the expeditionary force and, to Younghusband's displeasure, had done everything <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> have the appointment cancelled. He failed and Younghusband had his revenge for White's insubordination when he later left him in the leech-infested jungles of Sikkim to arrange mule and coolie transport to Tibet.|$|E
25|$|Notably clashing {{with his}} nominal {{subordinate}} Marcel Pauker over such issues, {{he did all}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> prevent the Party from adopting a clear point of view: when his attitude was investigated by the Balkan Communist Federation (1924), he had to resign his position, being excluded from the Party in 1926.

25|$|Schneerson {{took great}} {{interest}} {{in the affairs of}} the state of Israel, and did whatever was <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> support the infrastructure of the state and advance its success. He was concerned with the agricultural, industrial and overall economic welfare of Israel, and sought to promote its scientific achievements, and enhance Israel's standing in the international community.

25|$|Four {{days before}} the final session, which will center on Watergate, Frost {{receives}} a phonecall from an inebriated Nixon. In a drunken rant, Nixon declares that they both know the final interview will make or break their careers, and compares himself to Frost, insisting that they both came from humble backgrounds and had to struggle {{to make it to}} the top of their fields, only to be knocked back down again. Frost gains new insight into his subject, while Nixon assures Frost that he will do everything <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> emerge the victor from the final interview.|$|E
25|$|Schneerson, {{who had an}} {{intimate}} knowledge of the Soviet government and their tactics, opposed demonstrations on behalf of Soviet Jews, stating that he had evidence that they were harming Russia's Jews. Instead he advocated quiet diplomacy, which he said would be more effective. Schneerson did whatever was <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> push {{for the release of}} Jews from the former Soviet Union and established schools, communities and other humanitarian resources to assist with their absorption into Israel. On one known occasion he instructed Senator Chic Hecht to provide President Ronald Reagan with contact information of people who wished to leave so that he could lobby their release.|$|E

25|$|Madonna was {{admitted}} to Sanator in September 1950. She found this hospital {{very different from the}} Indian San. The grounds around the building were landscaped with trees and flowers, and patients were allowed to wear their own clothing and walk around the grounds. Her doctor, Dr. W. L. Meyers vowed to Madonna’s parents that he would do everything <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> help their daughter. The initial treatment was to pump air into the abdomen, and after that proved to be unsuccessful, they tried pumping air into her back to collapse the bad lung, which also failed. They next tried an operation called a phrenic which would permanently collapse her infected lung, again it failed to kill the TB.|$|E
25|$|Mr. Trowbridge {{returned}} from the school {{to say that the}} only hope for safety to any Americans seemed to be to return to the school, staying there alone, separated from the Armenians. He declared that we were powerless to save the Armenians. It seems that after we left the school, Miss Wallace, Mr. Chambers, and a young Armenian preacher attempted to cross the street from Miss Wallace's to the school. Just at this time a mob rushed around the corner. The infuriated Turks recognized the preacher as an Armenian, and although Mr. Chambers threw his arms about him and did all <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> save the man's life, they shot him dead. Not a single Armenian would they leave alive, the assassins shouted, as Mr. Chambers dragged the murdered preacher into the building.|$|E
25|$|I {{have just}} had an {{interview}} with Andrássy. He set forth his views clearly and plainly. I quite understood them and arrived at the conclusion that if you would trust him – and trust him entirely – we might still be saved, not only Hungary, but the monarchy, too.... I {{can assure you that}} you are not dealing with a man desirous of playing a part at any price or striving for a position; on the contrary, he is risking his present position, which is a fine one. But approaching shipwreck, he, too, is prepared to do all <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> save it; what he possesses – his understanding and influence in the country – he will lay at your feet.

When he is {{shot in the}} back by the clone of Baron Bedlam, the bullets stagger him, but they do not puncture his skin. With the addition of Terra's <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> own, his durability seems diminished. He can now be slashed by sharp items, but usually, deep wounds trigger an increase <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>powers,</b> leading <b>to</b> earth-manipulation abilities.|$|R
60|$|No {{one came}} near him that night, and he slept as soundly {{as he would}} have done <b>in</b> <b>his</b> tent <b>in</b> the midst of the Christian host.

25|$|For his {{services}} {{on this occasion}} he was rewarded by the king with almost every distinction which it was <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> confer. On the arrival of Alexander at Persepolis, he bestowed upon Peucestas the important satrapy of Persis, but, previous to this, he had already raised him {{to the rank of}} somatophylax (the king's bodyguard), an honour rendered the more conspicuous in this instance by the number of those select officers being augmented on purpose to make room for his admission. At Susa, also, Peucestas was the first of those rewarded with crowns of gold for their past exploits. After this he proceeded to take possession of his government, where he conciliated the favour of the Persians subject to his rule, {{as well as that of}} Alexander himself, by adopting the Persian dress and customs, in exchange for those of Macedonia; whence he is considered a Persophile.|$|E
25|$|Soon afterwards, in November 1643, by the king's orders, Ormonde {{dispatched}} {{a body of}} his troops into England to fight on the Royalist side in the Civil War, estimated at 4,000 troops, half of whom were sent from Cork. In November 1643 the king appointed Ormonde as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland—head of the Irish government executive, in other words. For {{the previous two years}} the occupant of this post had not set foot in Ireland. Ormonde's assigned mission was to prevent the king's Parliamentarian enemies from being reinforced from Ireland, and to aim to deliver more troops to fight for the Royalist side in England. To these ends, he had instructions to do all <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> keep the Scottish Covenanter army in the north of Ireland occupied. He was also given the king's authority to negotiate a Treaty with the Catholic Confederation which could allow their troops to be redirected against the Parliamentarians.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, the show {{had risen to}} the top of the ratings. One reason for the rise was the arrival of teenage prostitute Donna Beck (Candice Earley). Her {{relationship}} with the handsome Dr. Chuck Tyler breathed life into the show and captivated fans. Other new additions are the arrivals of aristocratic Palmer Cortlandt (aka Peter Cooney) (James Mitchell), his somewhat creepy housekeeper Myra Murdock (Elizabeth Lawrence), and his overprotected daughter Nina (Taylor Miller), who, to Palmer's chagrin, entrances Dr. Cliff Warner (Peter Bergman). Palmer does everything <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> break up the couple, including telling Nina she is going blind due to her diabetes. Palmer teams up with Cliff's past flame, nurse Sybil Thorne (Linda Gibboney), who confronts Cliff about fathering her son, but this is temporary; Sybil is murdered and Cliff is arrested for the crime, which actually was committed by Sean Cudahy (Alan Dysert). During the murder trial, Nina is astonished to learn that her mother, Daisy Cortlandt (Gillian Spencer), whom she believes to be dead, is, in fact, alive and living in Pine Valley as Monique Jonville. To everyone's complete shock, Myra acknowledges that Daisy to be her daughter. All My Children also found memorable villains in Billy Clyde Tuggle (Matthew Cowles) and Ray Gardner.|$|E
