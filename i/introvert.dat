5|$|The film's opening voiceover from Wilton {{introduces}} its {{themes of}} chance and fate, which he characterises as simple luck, to him all-important. The sequence establishes the protagonist as an <b>introvert,</b> {{a man who}} mediates his experience of the world through deliberation, and positions the film's subjective perspective through his narrative eyes. Charalampos Goyios argued that this hero, as an opera lover, maintains a sense of distance from the outer world and that ramifications therein {{pale in comparison to}} the purity of interior experience.|$|E
5|$|The film's soundtrack {{consists}} {{almost entirely}} of pre-World War I 78 rpm recordings of opera arias sung by the Italian tenor Enrico Caruso. This bold use, despite Caruso's variety of musical styles, constitutes a first for Allen. Opera has been used before in his work {{as an indicator of}} social class, such as in Husbands and Wives (1992). In Match Point, the arias and opera extracts make an ironic commentary on the actions of the characters and sometimes foreshadow developments in the movie's narrative. Furthermore, given Wilton's status as an <b>introvert</b> and opera enthusiast himself, the accompaniment emphasises his detachment from his crime.|$|E

5|$|A vegetarian, Modi has a frugal {{lifestyle}} {{and is a}} workaholic and <b>introvert.</b> Adept at using social media, he has been since September 2014 the second-most-followed leader in the world (with over 34.6 million followers on Twitter as of September 2017), behind Barack Obama (95.6 million followers) and Donald Trump(38.8 million followers). Modi's 31 August 2012 post on Google Hangouts made him the first Indian politician to interact with netizens on live chat. Modi has also been called a fashion-icon for his signature crisply ironed, half-sleeved kurta, {{as well as for}} a suit with his name embroidered repeatedly in the pinstripes that he wore during a state visit by US President Barack Obama, which drew public and media attention and criticism. Modi's personality has been variously described by scholars and biographers as energetic, arrogant, and charismatic.|$|E

He made his film debut in the 1995 comedy-drama Living in Oblivion. After {{appearing}} in a series of supporting parts in much of the 1990s and early 2000s, he made his breakthrough by starring in the Tom McCarthy-directed comedy-drama The Station Agent (2003), which had him play a railroad-obsessed <b>introvert</b> who inherits an abandoned train depot. He was cast in the role by director Tom McCarthy who recalled fondly his appearance in McCarthy's play The Killing Act (1995). For his performance, he received a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for Best Actor and an Independent Spirit Awards nomination for Best Male Lead.|$|E
25|$|Jung {{was one of}} {{the first}} people to define {{introversion}} and extraversion in a psychological context. In Jung’s Psychological Types, he theorizes that each person falls into one of two categories, the <b>introvert</b> and the extravert. These two psychological types Jung compares to ancient archetypes, Apollo and Dionysus. The <b>introvert</b> is likened with Apollo, who shines light on understanding. The <b>introvert</b> is focused on the internal world of reflection, dreaming and vision. Thoughtful and insightful, the <b>introvert</b> can sometimes be uninterested in joining the activities of others. The extravert is associated with Dionysus, interested in joining the activities of the world. The extravert is focused on the outside world of objects, sensory perception and action. Energetic and lively, the extrovert may lose their sense of self in the intoxication of Dionysian pursuits. Jungian introversion and extraversion is quite different from the modern idea of introversion and extroversion. Modern theories often stay true to behaviourist means of describing such a trait (sociability, talkativeness, assertiveness etc.) whereas Jungian introversion and extraversion is expressed as a perspective: introverts interpret the world subjectively, whereas extraverts interpret the world objectively.|$|E

30|$|Unexpected {{differences}} in the online behavior of extroverts and <b>introverts</b> is observed based on these questions. <b>Introverts</b> post more frequently than do extroverts, especially during the day. However, extroverts visit different cities rather than staying in one familiar city as <b>introverts</b> do. The spatial discrepancy becomes more unintuitive as we zoom in to increased resolution. For example, <b>introverts</b> tend to check in while shopping, whereas extroverts enjoy posting from their workplace. In addition, {{a tiny fraction of}} <b>introverts</b> might attempt to camouflage their own loneliness by tweeting from a large number of different areas (> 20). Extroverts enjoy sharing music and selfies, whereas <b>introverts</b> prefer retweeting news. In terms of online interactions, extroverts mention friends more often than <b>introverts</b> do, implying higher social vibrancy. By presenting a purchasing index to depict online buying intention, we find that compared to extroverts, <b>introverts</b> devote more effort to posting shopping tweets to relieve loneliness {{due to a lack of}} social interaction with others. We also categorize the emotion delivered by tweets into anger, disgust, happiness, sadness, and fear [23] and find that <b>introverts</b> post more angry and fearful (high arousal) tweets while extroverts post more sad (low arousal) tweets. Finally, extroverts attach greater meaning to online virtual honor than <b>introverts</b> do, implying that they might be ideal candidates for online promotion campaigns with virtual honor. To the our best knowledge, this is the first study to thoroughly compare the online behavior of extroverts and <b>introverts</b> in a large-scale sample, and our findings will be helpful to understand the role of personality in shaping human behavior.|$|R

40|$|The {{intent of}} this project is to {{research}} and observe how current language teaching techniques could be improved to better accommodate <b>introverted</b> students. One third of the population identifies as <b>introverted,</b> yet language classes are obviously designed for extroverted students. <b>Introverted</b> students have unique learning styles that are being overlooked, and this project aims to create options that would improve <b>introvert’s</b> language acquisition. This project consists in three parts: first, an observation of identified <b>introverts</b> and extroverts in beginning and intermediate language classes at Cal Poly. I kept an informal journal on what is working and what isn’t working for <b>introverted</b> students. Second, I gathered research on <b>introverts,</b> extroverts, language acquisition, and language teaching techniques to compose a formal study on the subject. And lastly, I created a solution {{in the form of}} a hypothetical class that incorporates what I have observed and researched, including lesson plans, activities, and environment that will allow <b>introverts</b> and extroverts to thrive. As an <b>introverted</b> Modern Languages and Literatures student, I am not satisfied with the amount of language proficiency I was able to acquire in my language classes. I believe that my quiet, introspective tendencies have hindered my ability to communicate sufficiently in a second language, and that if I had been given the right tools to fit my learning style, my Spanish fluency would have been better. This project allowed me to discover the ways that I, and other <b>introverts</b> learn best while exploring ways to fix my problem...|$|R

He insisted on always using the most formal forms of address, and even with friends he didn't use first-names. This is also the reason why he became known only as P. Munch. His work ethic was, however, second to none, and his output in terms of books, pamphlets, articles (both academic and for newspapers), letters, diaries and other notes, is immense.|$|E
5000|$|Mistaking {{introversion}} for shyness is {{a common}} error. <b>Introverts</b> prefer solitary to social activities, but do not necessarily fear social encounters like shy people do.Susan Cain argues in Quiet: The Power of <b>Introverts</b> in a World That Can't Stop Talking that modern Western culture misjudges the capabilities of <b>introverted</b> people, leading to a waste of talent, energy and happiness. Cain describes how society is biased against <b>introverts,</b> and that, with people being taught from childhood that to be sociable is to be happy, introversion is now considered [...] "somewhere between a disappointment and pathology". In contrast, Cain says that introversion is not a [...] "second-class" [...] trait but that both <b>introverts</b> and extraverts enrich society, with examples including the <b>introverts</b> J. K. Rowling, Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, Mahatma Gandhi, Dr. Seuss, W. B. Yeats, Steven Spielberg and Larry Page.|$|R

50|$|<b>Introverted</b> intuition is the intuition {{that acts}} in an <b>introverted</b> and thus, {{subjective}} manner. <b>Introverted</b> intuition {{is a function}} that {{is often described as}} hard to explain, due to its highly inward and intangible nature. The <b>introverted</b> intuition type has the ability to 'thread' multiple sources of phenomena into a certain view or vision. This is contrary to its opposite, extraverted sensation, which sees things as they comes and in a very concrete manner. The lack of this extraverted sensation can often make the Ni type a very dogged character, ignoring what is apparent and focusing on their synthesised worldview. Unlike its <b>introverted</b> irrational counterpart, <b>introverted</b> sensation, <b>introverted</b> intuition looks not to indulge in a meticulous cataloging of physical experiences and recalling them when the user perceives similarity in their subjective experiences of current reality (since Si doesn't objectively experience reality unlike Se) but always looks for future implications of the observable reality and how one chain of event leads to another. It always goes beyond the concrete data where Si does not.|$|R
25|$|Bhagwan Gopinath, {{being an}} <b>introvert,</b> {{was a man}} of few words and had a {{straightforward}} demeanor. He is known to have always shunned publicity and covered himself with anonymity. As such, various religious commentators along with his devotees have found it difficult to classify his spiritual journey into a particular school of Indian philosophical thought. Its widely believed that he must have followed the tenets of trika doctrine of advaita (non-dual) Kashmir Shaivism (in which, the Goddess Bhairavi-Aghoreshwari is enthroned above God Bhairava and is the main ideal of worship) with jnana (knowledge), iccha (will) and kriya (action) having had a dominating influence on him.|$|E

They married at unspecified time, though prior to 1904; he tended to be quiet and unassuming, she was also <b>introvert,</b> but of a decisive and bold character. The couple settled at Calle Valázquez; they had 9 children, 6 boys and 3 girls.

25|$|Introverts {{often take}} {{pleasure}} in solitary activities such as reading, writing, using computers, hiking and fishing. The archetypal artist, writer, sculptor, scientist, engineer, composer and inventor are all highly introverted. An <b>introvert</b> is likely to enjoy time spent alone and find less reward in time spent with large groups of people, though they may enjoy interactions with close friends. Trust is usually an issue of significance: a virtue of utmost importance to introverts is choosing a worthy companion. They prefer to concentrate on a single activity {{at a time and}} like to observe situations before they participate, especially observed in developing children and adolescents. They are more analytical before speaking. Introverts are easily overwhelmed by too much stimulation from social gatherings and engagement, introversion having even been defined by some in terms of a preference for a quiet, more minimally stimulating external environment.|$|E

2500|$|Despite these differences, a {{meta-analysis}} of 15 experience sampling studies {{has suggested that}} {{there is a great deal}} of overlap in the way that extraverts and <b>introverts</b> behave. In these studies, participants used mobile devices to report how extraverted (e.g., bold, talkative, assertive, outgoing) they were acting at multiple times during their daily lives. Fleeson and Gallagher (2009) found that extraverts regularly behave in an <b>introverted</b> way, and <b>introverts</b> regularly behave in an extraverted way. Indeed, there was more within-person variability than between-person variability in extraverted behaviours. The key feature that distinguishes extraverts and <b>introverts</b> was that extraverts tend to act moderately extraverted about 5–10% more often than <b>introverts.</b> From this perspective, extraverts and <b>introverts</b> are not [...] "fundamentally different". Rather, an [...] "extravert" [...] is just someone who acts more extraverted more often, suggesting that extraversion is more about what one [...] "does" [...] than what one [...] "has".|$|R

25|$|The Central Library {{consisted}} of two elements: the extrovert lending library and the <b>introvert</b> reference library. The lending library was designed for heavy use and short visits. It formed a wing to the reference library and was of three storeys with a curved façade facing the Town Hall. The reference library was an eight-storey square block designed around an open atrium above a public square {{that was designed to}} be entered from four sides. Above the square floated the cantilevered floors of the library in a distinctive inverted ziggurat formation. The designers drew inspiration for the design from Antonio Sant'Elia's drawings of Casa a gradinata, and Marcel Breuer's 1928 scheme for a hospital at Elberfeld, Indiana; while another source of inspiration was Leslie Martin's Bodleian Law Library in Oxford. It has also been suggested that they were influenced by the similar design for Boston City Hall, but a member of Madin’s design team said they had only seen this design after the library was complete.|$|E
