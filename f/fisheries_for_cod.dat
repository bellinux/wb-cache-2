40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{economic}} effects of introducing quotas to an open access fishery. When quotas are introduced, effort should decrease. This leads to higher prices and lower costs. Thus, overall profits should increase. An empirical analysis of profits in the Norwegian cod fisheries is conducted. Quotas were introduced in this fishery in 1990, and the dataset used covers 1985 - 2005. The research question is: Did profits rise in Norwegian <b>fisheries</b> <b>for</b> <b>cod,</b> after quotas were introduced? Because the quotas limit {{the activity of the}} fishers, the stock is affected. In order to see whether quotas increased profits, it is necessary to do an analysis with levels of stock as it would have developed without the quotas. Therefore a simulation of the stock is done. This is used to simulate landings and profits. The empirical results suggest that there have been a considerable increase in profits for the fishers after 1990. Few variables on effort and opportunities explain profits. Binary variables for years with and without quotas, however, explain a lot of the change in profits. The effects of other changes to policy and market conditions are also controlled for. These indicate that the quotas increased profits in two rounds. First right after the introduction, and then again some years later, as fishers started to trade quotas...|$|E
40|$|New England boasts one of {{the most}} {{productive}} marine ecosystems in the world. It has a long and rich tradition of fishing and has supported large scale commercial <b>fisheries</b> <b>for</b> <b>cod</b> and other groundfish (e. g., haddock and flounder) for centuries. The region also has a less envious tradition of fishery management failures including the “collapse” of a number of groundfish stocks in the 1990 s. Before 1977, the groundfish fishery was practically unregulated and was open to local and international fishing fleets alike. Overfishing caused dramatic declines in many fish stocks in New England and other regions, prompting passage of the Fishery Conservation Management Act (known as the Magnuson-Stevens Act), which allowed the federal government to regulate fisheries out to 200 miles. The Magnuson-Stevens Act (MSA) created a fishery system that revolved around regional management councils, which developed and implemented fishery management plans (FMPs) and directed fishermen in their activities. The New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC) has management authority over the New England multispecies groundfish fishery. It implemented a series of fishery management plans for the northeastern United States. These plans adopted a broad suite of management measures designed to achieve the fishing mortality targets necessary to rebuild certain overfished stocks and aspired to meet other requirements of the MSA. When a regional council develops an FMP, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), acting on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce, evaluate it for compliance with the ten national standards set forth in the MSA, as amended by the Sustainable Fisheries Act (SFA). A 2001 lawsuit by the Conservation Law Foundation (CLF) against the Secretary of Commerce, NOAA, and NFMS alleged that plans for rebuilding groundfish stocks failed to meet the national standards. CLF argued that the plans failed to adequately mitigate overfishing practices or to comply with bycatch restrictions. The lawsuit’s settlement led to Amendment 13 of the FMP. Among other things, Amendment 13 made possible a new style of fishery management for the New England multispecies groundfish fishery, namely, the creation of harvesting cooperatives known as “sectors. ” Sectors are a form of community-based fisheries management. They require that groups of fishermen join together and agree to manage themselves collectively. By law, fishermen are obliged to sign a formal contract setting forth the key terms of their cooperative arrangement. The novelty and complexity of these contracts requires specialized legal drafting. Pursuant to a grant from the National Sea Grant Law Center, the University of Maine School of Law, in partnership with the Gulf of Maine Research Institute, and the New England office of the Ocean Conservancy, convened a workshop in November 2007, to address key legal issues raised by sector operating agreements. This article summarizes the Sector Workshop’s proceedings by highlighting the major legal issues discussed at the meeting. Part II describes community-based management generally and sectors as a management tool for the New England multispecies fishery. Part III discusses the legal issues to be resolved in sector operating agreements and reflects some of the specific concerns and suggestions raised by the workshop participants. Part IV concludes with reflections on sectors as a management tool and provides information on resources for those in the New England multispecies fishing industry who are considering forming or joining a sector...|$|E

40|$|Small cetaceans, such as harbour porpoises, {{often become}} {{entangled}} in gillnets, and this anthropogenic mortality is a conservation concern. For years, harbour porpoises have been captured regularly in fisheries in waters of Newfoundland and Labrador (Canada), but defendable estimates have been lacking. Incidental catch of small cetaceans in nearshore and offshore gillnet fisheries in Newfoundland and Labrador waters was studied {{for the years}} 2001, 2002 and 2003, using datasets from Fisheries and Oceans Canada, reports from fishers, and Fishery Observer records. Fisheries studied included those targeting Atlantic cod, lumpfish, Atlantic herring, monkfish, white hake, Greenland halibut, redfish and winter flounder. [...] A methodology was developed to estimate incidental catch, based on datasets currently available within the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. Confidence intervals were generated using resampling statistics, allowing an assessment of uncertainty surrounding these estimates. Despite reductions in fishing effort since 1992, an estimated average of 1, 516 harbour porpoises were captured in various Newfoundland and Labrador gillnet fisheries annually between 2001 and 2003. Most captures occurred in nearshore <b>fisheries</b> <b>for</b> Atlantic <b>cod</b> and lumpfish. Several dolphin species were also captured in smaller numbers, mostly in the offshore monkfish fishery. The impact of this mortality on the population of harbour porpoise and other small cetaceans cannot be assessed until population estimates become available. [...] Using the same methodology, incidental catch assessments were compiled for numerous species of pinnipeds, seabirds, sharks and bony fish that had been reported as incidental catch. For most species, insufficient information exists {{to assess the impact}} of this mortality. However, catch rates of harbour seals, murres. shearwaters, various shark species and sturgeons appear to warrant concern. [...] In conclusion, Newfoundland and Labrador gillnet fisheries annually remove considerable numbers of non-target large marine vertebrates from the local marine ecosystem.

40|$|The {{conflict}} between grey seals, Halichoerus grypus, and the Swedish cod fisheries in the Baltic Sea has steadily increased {{during the past}} 10 years. Seals locate the fishermen’s nets, damage the catch and tear holes in the nets. In this study we investigated the damages caused by seals on the net <b>fishery</b> <b>for</b> <b>cod,</b> Gadus morhua, in the central Baltic Sea. Damage includes both the visible damage and the hidden damage i. e. the fish that are taken whole without leaving any visible trace or damages to the nets. To gather the required data an observer joined two professional fishermen {{for a period of}} tree months in 2005. During that period all catch were recorded together with any visible damages. On some experimental links of nets the caught fish were marked without being removed from the net. The net was reset and when retrieved again the number of damaged or lost marked fish was noted. Corrections to the data were made to account for fish that spontaneously fall off. On 101 out of 184 links set out damaged fish were found. Damaged fish was most often found as small remains or with only the head of the fish left. At 20 out of 31 occasions when fish were left in the net, marked fish were missing or found damaged indicating a seal visit. 64. 3 percent of the marked cod were removed from the damaged links without leaving any visible trace, and an additional 10. 1 percent were damaged adding up to a total damage of 74. 4 percent of the catch. There was also a significant difference in catch per effort (cod caught per 100 m* 24 h) between damaged and non-damaged experimental links.

Furthermore, the link between primary productivity and herbivory by the calanoid copepod, Calanus finmarchicus provides the trophic link between primary producers and the important commercial <b>fishery</b> <b>for</b> Atlantic <b>Cod.</b> However, one result of ocean warming is that the distribution of the cold water loving Calanus finmarchicus is being pushed northwards which adversely affects the food supply to juvenile Cod.

The purpose of this article is to analyse cooperative and non-cooperative management of the Northeast Atlantic cod fishery. This will be done in a game theoretic context, based on different assumptions regarding important variables such as cost of effort and initial stock size. The game theoretic analysis will be based on an empirical bioeconomic model developed and estimated by Hannesson (2007, 2010). The case of cooperative management is analysed for different cost parameters and starting values of the stock. An interesting result is that the optimal policy gives rise to pulse fishing. As this involves effort (and harvests) varying from year to year, potentially imposing substantial social costs on the industry in years when the fishery is closed, a policy of constant effort is also considered.

Two of the populations co-habit the North Sea, and trawl survey data showed differing trends in their abundances.

Two different grid systems were used, both with an inter-bar distance of 55 mm. The Norwegian vessel used predominantly the 4. 5 m semi-rigid "Sort-X" system, while the Russian vessel used a 1. 5 m single-grid system. In a few tows the Norwegian vessel used a single-grid system mounted in a two-panel Alfredo-type trawl. The experiment were divided into four periods. By assistance from the Norwegian vessel during the first period, the Russian trawl was observed by an underwater vehicle carrying video camera. The single-grid system appeared to perform as anticipated. Underwater observations of the singlegrid system in the Norwegian trawl revealed poor performance, and it was reinstalled to give a better performance. Comparative fishing trials in the second period with covers and blinders gave almost similar 50 % retention values for "Sort-X" used in the Norwegian trawl and the Russian single-grid system in the russian trawl, with L 50 of 50. 3 and 49. 7 cm, respectively. The "Sort-X" system gave a somewhat sharper selection, with a selection range of 11 cm compared to 15 cm for the singlegrid system. Both systems had a very good release of small fish; with an escape rate for fish smaller than 42 cm of 93 - 94 % and of fish smaller than 47 cm of 88 - 89 %. During the third period, single-grid systems were used on board both vessels. This system worked as before for the Russian trawl, but did not work properly with the Norwegian Alfredo-type trawl. Although a good performance during UTV-observation, the selectivity experiments revealed that the single grid in the Norwegian trawl had a low angle of attack, and that far from all fish were brought into contact with the grid. During the fourth and perhaps the most important stage of the experiments, the trawls were rigged as during commercial fishing, with a single-grid system and a 135 mm codend in the Russian trawl, and the "Sort-X" system and a 135 mm twin-codend in the Norwegian Alfredo-type trawl. The size distribution from the five parallel tows were not significantly different. Analysis of data from hauls with and without blinder revealed a slight codend selection in the Russian trawl aft of the single-grid system and minor or no codend size selection aft of the "Sort-X" system. The two grid-systems tested during these experiments have both their benefits and drawbacks regarding selectivity, handling and expenditure aspects. The grid systems as used in the respective trawls with ordinary codends give a close to similar selectivity, and will undoubtedly improve the overall size selectivity of bottom trawls. NORSK SAMMENDRAG:På oppfordring fra Den blandete norsk-russiske fiskerikommisjon (sesjon 23) ble det i september 1995 utført sammenlignende forsøk med to ristsorteringssystemer i torsketrål, det norske "Sort-X"-systemet og det russiske sorteringssystemet med enkel rist. Feltforsøkene ble utført ombord i MRr "Anny Kræmer" og MITr "Bizon" på kysten av Øst-Finnmark og ved Bjørnøya. Resultatene viser at det norske sorteringssystemet isolert sett ga litt bedre seleksjon enn det russiske. Når sorteringssystemene ble brukt som under kommersielt fiske uten noen form for dekknett, ga norsk og russisk trål tilnærmet lik lengdefordeling av fisk...|$|R
40|$|Interaction between {{seals and}} {{fisheries}} along the Swedish coast has serious {{environmental and economic}} consequences. This thesis describes the conflict as it affects four different small-scale coastal fisheries; the eel fisheries on the west coast, the herring fisheries and salmon fisheries in the northern Baltic and the cod fisheries in the central Baltic. Knowledge gained through studies {{of the interaction between}} seals and fisheries has been instrumental for the development of alternative seal-safe fishing gear and mitigation methods. <b>For</b> some <b>fisheries</b> the improved understanding has led to a resolution of certain parts of the conflict. Certain coastal fisheries in the Baltic, such as the herring gillnet fishery, are at the point of collapse because of this conflict. Damage caused by grey seals to this fishery {{has been shown to be}} much more extensive than previously recognised. When seals raid nets, a significant part of the catch is lost without trace. Seals remove fish from nets without leaving any remains. This represents a hidden loss. Another hidden loss is caused by the presence of seals around fishing gear, which scares away fish from the area. The result is often a total loss of catch. Hidden losses are also evident in the gillnet <b>fishery</b> <b>for</b> <b>cod</b> in the central Baltic sea. In recent years damage by seals in the cod gillnet fishery has increased significantly. Due to the high value of cod the cod fishery is currently one of the fisheries that suffer the highest economic loss by seal damage. Seal-safe fishing gear is at present the only long lasting solution which would meet the needs of both seals and fishermen. Mitigation of damage to catch and fishing gear as well as the prevention of accidental by-catch are two sides of the same problem; a solution to one is also a solution to the other. However, development of new fishing gear is challenging and time-consuming. It requires better knowledge of both fish and seal behaviour. At present suitable alternative fishing gear is not available <b>for</b> the herring <b>fisheries</b> carried out through the whole season. However, a herring trap has been developed as an alternative fishing gear for catching spawning herring in spring time. In the cod gillnet fishery, promising results have been achieved in trials of an alternative fishing gear - the two-chamber pot. Another coastal fishery in the Baltic subjected to damage by grey seals, is the salmon trap net fishery in the North Baltic. A seal-safe salmon trap has been developed and is used by most of the salmon fishermen. This so called pontoon trap prevents the seal from reaching the catch by keeping the fish in an enclosed seal-safe fish chamber. However, in recent years there have been reports of damage by seals also in the pontoon trap. By filming the seals attacking traps it has been possible to identify 10 individual seals hunting in the traps and to determine that these same animals returned to the traps over a long period of time. It is possible therefore, to limit or decrease damage to the fisheries by limiting access for or by culling the individual seals specialized in raiding fishing gear. On the west coast of Sweden the eel fyke net fishery suffers from damage by harbour seals. In order to find a lasting solution to the conflict, seal behaviour has been studied as well as the fyke nets' fishing efficiency. The issue of whether it is the eels or the by-caught species which motivate harbour seals to attack fyke nets was studied. It was shown that harbour seals raiding fyke nets have a preference for eel. Certain harbour seals that specialise in foraging at fyke nets, have developed different feeding preferences compared to those of most seals. Seal-safe fyke nets, which resisted attacks while still being efficient in terms of yield, have been developed. They are already in use in commercial fishery along the west coast...|$|R
40|$|Cormorants {{and other}} {{wildlife}} populations have come in real or perceived conflicts with humans over exploited fish stocks. From gut contents of cormorants, and using {{an extension of the}} Catch equation, we estimated the degree of short term competition between great cormorants and coastal fisheries in two areas along the Swedish Baltic Sea. Cormorants consumed 10 and 44 %, in respective area, of the fish biomass of six fish species harvested by humans; eel, flounder, herring, perch, pike, and whitefish. On average, cormorants consumed smaller individuals than harvested in <b>fisheries.</b> But <b>for</b> perch, <b>cod</b> and flounder, cormorants consumed harvestable sized fish corresponding > 20 % of human catches. Our competition model estimated the direct decrease in fisheries catches due to cormorant predation to be 30 %) and perch (2 - 20 %). When also including the indirect effects of cormorant predation on smaller fish that never reached harvestable size, the estimated decrease in fisheries catches at least doubled for perch (13 - 34 %) and pike (8 - 19 %). Despite large uncertainties, our model indicates that cormorants may locally have a direct impact on human catches of at least flounder, and when incorporating indirect effects also on perch and pike. The study indicates that the degree of competition between cormorants and humans varies substantially between areas. We also included economical values in the model and concluded that for the commercially most important species, eel and cod, the estimated economic impact of cormorants on fisheries was low...|$|R

5000|$|As {{early as}} 1605, the French Acadians built dikes in the Maritimes for wheat, flax, vegetables, {{pasturage}} and marshland farming.

A small percentage of land is put into use in fruit farming as well along Nova Scotia's northwest coastal areas.The American Revolution, 1775-1783, and its attendant food decline resulted in 3100 hectares cleared in Newfoundland.

[...] A {{very small percentage of}} the land is suitable in Newfoundland and Labrador for horticultural or crop production because {{there is a lot of}} forested and tundra geography. The province has some dairy production and farming concerns. Following World War II, farm training was available at the Government Demonstration Farm. Bonuses were paid for such things as the purchase of pure-bred sires, land clearing, and agriculture exhibition assistance to name a few. The industry of fish processing for food is the largest agricultural contribution from Newfoundland. Newfoundland <b>fisheries,</b> supply <b>cod</b> <b>for</b> the most part, followed closely by herring, haddock, lobster, rose fish, seals, and whales. The fishing industry depends very heavily upon exports and world conditions.|$|R
