Evans commented on the possibility of representing Team GB at the London 2012 Summer Olympics: [...] "If I was asked then it's something I'd definitely look at doing. I don't <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>I</b> even will be though... But if the chance was there then, like anyone else, I’d certainly have to think about it." ...|$|E
500|$|During a {{performance}} {{in which the}} group received a request for early material, Ivey stated [...] "I'm still trying to work it out—how to follow God and still give you the old shit" [...] and introduced the group's Christian songs with self-deprecation, referring to the songs as [...] "the new, reborn, love-God Basehead stuff." [...] In a 1998 interview, Ivey stated [...] "I'm kind of wary of the Church. I know there's this whole Christian music market, but I don't think, theology-wise, I'm in agreement with {{a whole lot of}} Christians. [...] In fact, I don't <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>I</b> like even being called a Christian." ...|$|E
500|$|Calvin's friends {{urged him}} to marry. Calvin took a prosaic view, writing to one correspondent:I, who have the air of being so hostile to celibacy, I am still not married and do not <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>I</b> will ever be. If I take a wife it will be because, being better freed from {{numerous}} worries, I can devote myself to the Lord. Several candidates were presented to him including one young woman from a noble family. Reluctantly, Calvin agreed to the marriage, {{on the condition that}} she would learn French. Although a wedding date was planned for March 1540, he remained reluctant and the wedding never took place. He later wrote that he would never think of marrying her, [...] "unless the Lord had entirely bereft me of my wits". Instead, in August of that year, he married Idelette de Bure, a widow who had two children from her first marriage.|$|E

500|$|Former {{editor of}} The Daily Telegraph, Charles Moore {{noted that the}} report does not reveal the [...] "extent of abuse" [...] and that it [...] "contains , in a sense which a court would recognise." [...] He commented that it [...] "undermines justice" [...] by [...] "treat {{allegations}} as facts", noting the report's admission that [...] "the information has not been corroborated" [...] and viewing its contents as [...] "not {{a contribution to the}} truth". He did not feel it right to overcompensate for previously dismissive attitudes to such an extent [...] "that every accusation must be considered true". Referring to the 2000 [...] documentary When Louis Met... Jimmy, Moore noted Savile's response to claims of paedophilia: [...] "How does anyone <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>I</b> am or not?" [...] He concluded that this specific question (and also concerning [...] "future Saviles") is [...] "not [...] easier to answer" [...] by the [...] "uninformative and self-righteous" [...] report.|$|E
500|$|When people google Jackson, some of {{the first}} search results feature her in the nude. Jackson said of this: [...] "Instead of being known for my {{basketball}} skills, all of these nudie shots are always the first thing you see." [...] She posed nude in an Australian magazine, Black+White, that featured Olympic athletes who were set to compete in Athens in the 2004 Summer Olympics. The expensively printed magazine/book has been produced for the last three Olympic Games and, by the 2004 edition, was considered uncontroversial in Australia with its [...] "artistic" [...] approach to nude photography, and its equal coverage of male and female athletes, although it did create a stir in the United States. She also posed for the 2005 edition of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. Of posing nude, she said, [...] "if offered the opportunity, I think that it's a personal decision. Whether you do it for the money or whatever, again, I think it's a personal decision. I don't <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>I</b> would say yes or no. I guess you cross that bridge when you come to it. I don't think it's a bad thing, I'm not against it." ...|$|E
500|$|After Minh {{had ordered}} the rebels to search the areas {{known to have been}} frequented by the Ngo family, Colonel Phạm Ngọc Thảo was {{informed}} by a captured Presidential Guard officer that the brothers had escaped through the tunnels to a refuge in Cholon. Thảo was told by Khiêm, his superior, to locate Diệm and prevent him from being killed. When Thảo arrived at Ma Tuyen's house, he phoned his superiors. Diệm and Nhu overheard him and Thơ drove them to the nearby Catholic church of St. Francis Xavier, which they had frequented over the years. Lieutenant Thơ died a few months later in a plane crash, but his diary was not found until 1970. Thơ recorded Diệm's words as they left the house of Ma Tuyen as being [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>I</b> will live or die and I don't care, but tell Nguyễn Khánh that I have great affection for him and he should avenge me". Soon after the early morning mass was celebrated for All Souls' Day (the Catholic day of the dead) and after the congregation had left the building, the Ngô brothers walked through the shady courtyard and into the church wearing dark grey suits. It was speculated that they were recognised by an informant as they walked through the yard. Inside the church, the brothers prayed and received Communion.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2000, he was {{the subject}} of an {{in-depth}} documentary by Louis Theroux, in the When Louis Met... series. In it, Theroux asked about rumours he was a paedophile. Savile said: [...] " [...] live in a very funny world. And it's easier for me, as a single man, to say [...] "I don't like children" [...] because that puts a lot of salacious tabloid people off the hunt.... How do they <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>I</b> am [...] or not? How does anybody <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>I</b> am? Nobody knows whether I am or not. I know I'm not." ...|$|E
2500|$|Woods {{himself is}} {{reported}} as {{saying about the}} tour: [...] "I enjoyed it very much. There was the cricket and going about in trains; I liked the views very much.

I think I should like to live in England, though I don't <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>I</b> could stand the cold in the winter." ...|$|E

2500|$|My {{answer to}} readers {{who want to}} <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>I</b> am [...] "really" [...] an insider or an {{outsider}} to the Pagan community is that I am neither and both [...] that how I look at things depends very much upon context, but contains both anthropological and Pagan perspectives at the same time. The ethnographic perspective is not about being an objective observer of a culture, but rather about containing within one body multiple, simultaneous frames of reference with which to interpret experience, {{and being able to}} shift easily from one to the other.|$|E
2500|$|White devoted {{himself more}} than ever to his {{teaching}} {{in order to take}} his mind off of these problems. He rarely photographed during this period, and many of his colleagues were similarly affected. Perhaps because they longed for something to remind them of how things were before the war, White and Stieglitz gradually reconciled many of their differences. This was the only half-way bright spot in an otherwise difficult period. In 1923 White wrote to Stieglitz, saying [...] "I understand that [...] Seeley is doing nothing; Coburn likewise; Day sick in bed. I do not <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>I</b> can again do anything, but I hope someday to try." ...|$|E
2500|$|Flight 843, {{carrying}} 143 {{passengers and}} 10 crew members, took off around 2:00 pm PST on Monday, June 28, 1965. After {{going through the}} pre-flight check-list, Captain Charles Kimes, 44, let his co-pilot, Fred Miller, 47, handle the take-off. As the aircraft climbed to an altitude of approximately 800 feet, the number 4 (outer-right) engine exploded, rupturing the right outboard fuel tank and igniting the fuel inside. [...] The explosion and resulting fire caused the last 25 or so feet of the right wing, along with the damaged engine, to break {{off from the rest}} of the aircraft. Captain Kimes radioed the tower [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>I</b> can keep it in the air or not." ...|$|E

6000|$|At this moment, however, a loud shout from Scroope, who {{was looking}} for me, {{reinforced}} by a shrill cry uttered by Miss Manners, banished every pigeon within half a mile, a fact of which I was not sorry, since who <b>knows</b> <b>whether</b> <b>I</b> should have it all, or any, of the next three birds? ...|$|R
6000|$|In {{the time}} I am now writing of, the second letter from Nugent arrived. It was written {{the evening before}} he sailed for the Polar seas. One line in it touched us deeply.

2500|$|.....crystallized {{the essence}} of the band. It had {{everything}} there and showed the band at its best... as a band, as a unit. Not talking about solos or anything, it had everything there. We were careful never to release it as a single. It was a milestone for us. Every musician wants to do something of lasting quality, something which will hold up {{for a long time and}} I guess we did it with [...] "Stairway". [...] Townshend probably thought that he got it with Tommy. I don't <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>I</b> have the ability to come up with more. I have to do a lot of hard work before I can get anywhere near those stages of consistent, total brilliance.|$|E
2500|$|As {{might be}} expected, the joint paper alerted those {{subscribers}} {{who met the}} argument {{for the first time}} in print, and whose minds were prepared by prior struggles with the species question. Alfred Newton, who held the chair in Zoology and Comparative Anatomy at Cambridge from 1866 to 1907, wrote this: [...] "I sat up late that night to read it and never shall I forget the impression it made upon me. Herein was contained a perfectly simple solution of all the difficulties which had been troubling me for months past. I hardly <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>I</b> at first felt more vexed at the solution not having occurred to me than pleased that it had been found at all" [...] (he was not alone in that thought!—see T.H. Huxley). Newton remained a Darwinian for the rest of his life. (Wollaston 1921 p112; see also Newton 1888) ...|$|E
2500|$|Southey's {{contemporary}} James Losh {{believed that}} the poem was [...] "superior to anything before written by Southey". A letter from Charles Lamb to Southey dated 6 May 1815 said, [...] "I have, since the receipt of your present, read it quite through again, and with no diminished pleasure. I don't <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>I</b> ought {{to say that it}} has given me more pleasure than any of your long poems. Kehama is doubtless more powerful, but I don't feel that firm footing in it that I do in Roderick". An anonymous review in the December 1814 Theatrical Inquisitor argued, [...] "It is scarcely possible to view the errors of exalted genius without breathing a sigh of compassion and regret. The generous mind feels humiliated at the contemplation [...] Such are the feelings that must be excited by the reader of Southey's poems [...] The story of the present poem is interesting, and would probably have made an excellent romance. It has, however, several capital defects, that make it altogether unfit for an heroic poem".|$|E

2500|$|The {{decision}} {{to break up}} {{came as a surprise}} to many in the industry who believed Bardot {{was in the process of}} establishing a strong and credible reputation. Rumours circulated that the split was a result of Monk's desire to begin a solo career, though she denied this. In 2004, during an interview with FHM magazine, Polihronas revealed, [...] "I think when Sophie went solo, everyone assumed that it was she who broke up the band, which wasn't right. I don't <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>I</b> should say this, but I wanted out for a long time. Sophie and I both knew that we were going to fulfil the last album and then move on, but Sophie stayed with the management, and continued on. I took a whole year off without even thinking about it." [...] Soon after Bardot's split, Wood confirmed that at the time, both she and Chapple were the two members keen to continue as Bardot. In 2013, an unreleased track titled [...] "Honesty", written by Chapple and Play It Like That collaborator [...] Michael D'Arcy leaked onto the internet, with lyrics stating a [...] "little girl who wants to sing all the songs / a little blonde caught up in the show" [...] not being honest. [...] This is rumoured to be Chapple's response to Monk starting her solo career at the time.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 April Charles {{wrote to}} his older sister Susan that he had also seen the {{rhinoceros}} in the zoo let {{out for the first}} time that spring, [...] "kicking & rearing" [...] and galloping for joy. He then passed on the gossip that Miss Martineau had been [...] "as frisky lately [...] the Rhinoceros. – Erasmus has been with her noon, morning, and night: – if her character was not as secure, as a mountain in the polar regions she certainly would loose it. – Lyell called there the other day & there was a beautiful rose on the table, & she coolly showed it to him & said [...] "Erasmus Darwin" [...] gave me that. – How fortunate it is, she is so very plain; otherwise I should be frightened: She is a wonderful woman". He began thinking about marriage himself, and on the back of an old letter (dated 7 April 1838) he listed the pros and cons of London, Cambridge or the countryside, noting that [...] "I have so much more pleasure in direct observation, that I could not go on as Lyell does, correcting & adding up new information to old train & I do not see what line can be followed by man tied down to London. – In country, experiment & observations on lower animals. – more space – [...] ". In an 8 May letter to his Cambridge friend Charles Thomas Whitley, who had recently married, Darwin described himself as having [...] "turned a complete scribbler", and said [...] "Of the future I know nothing I never look further ahead than two or three Chapters – for my life is now measured by volume, chapters & sheets & has little to do with the sun – As for a wife, that most interesting specimen in the whole series of vertebrate animals, Providence only <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>I</b> shall ever capture one or be able to feed her if caught." ...|$|E
