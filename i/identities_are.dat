5|$|Contemporary {{political}} sociology includes these areas of research, {{but it has}} been opened up to wider questions of power and politics. Today political sociologists are as likely to be concerned with how <b>identities</b> <b>are</b> formed that contribute to structural domination by one group over another; the politics of who knows how and with what authority; and questions of how power is contested in social interactions {{in such a way as}} to bring about widespread cultural and social change. Such questions are more likely to be studied qualitatively. The study of social movements and their effects has been especially important in relation to these wider definitions of politics and power.|$|E

[...] University of Washington, 1996 A social {{identity}} model of majority influence in negotiations is presented, which considers {{the effects of}} various social identifications on the processes of integrative and distributive bargaining. Two-faction negotiations were examined in a laboratory experiment: negotiation configuration was varied (negotiations were composed of either a majority faction and a minority faction or two equal-sized factions), as <b>was</b> social <b>identity</b> (negotiators <b>were</b> led to either identify with their own individual party or with the group of negotiators as a whole). Negotiators' agreements were less integrative when group <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> salient than when individual <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> salient, particularly in negotiations between a majority and a minority Also, the majority faction had a significantly greater profit advantage over the minority faction when group <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> salient than when individual <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> salient. However, although the majority's relative advantage was greater when group <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> salient, majority members did not earn significantly more in an absolute sense when group <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> salient than when individual <b>identity</b> <b>was</b> salient.
