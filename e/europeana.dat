25|$|The Library has {{experience}} of sharing content from its collections under open content licences on platforms such as Wikipedia (e.g., the John Thomas photographic collection) and Flickr. In February 2013, the Library contributed 50 images relating to Monmouthshire to Wikipedia, a successful pilot project with Wikimedia UK. The following month, they {{became one of}} the cultural heritage organisations that partnered with Wikimedia Nederland, Wikimedia UK and Wikimedia France, together with <b>Europeana,</b> to be part of their collaboration to provide a set of tools to mass upload material from GLAM institutions to Wikimedia Commons. Also in 2013, the Library was awarded the Wikimedia UK 'GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums) of the Year Award', for being 'a reliable supporter of the Wikimedia movement aims.’ By January 2016 almost 8,000 images had been made available for free download.|$|E
25|$|Other texts by Aderca saw {{print in}} Punct (a provincial {{satellite}} of Contimporanul, founded and edited by Scarlat Callimachi), and in Omul Liber daily, where, in 1923, he denounced novelist Cezar Petrescu for having plagiarized {{the writings of}} Guy de Maupassant. His ideas on Jewish community life saw print in Lumea Evree, a bimonthly put out by philosopher Iosif Brucăr. His other articles and various pieces were scattered throughout literary reviews: Viața Românească, Vremea, Ideea <b>Europeană,</b> Adevărul Literar și Artistic, Flacăra, Revista Fundațiilor Regale, Revista Literară and the literary supplement of Universul all featured his work. Researcher Dumitru Hîncu, who counts some 60 publications to have enlisted Aderca's contribution, also notes his collaboration with Îndreptarea, the press organ of Alexandru Averescu's People's Party. In addition to signing with his name or initials (capitalized or not), Aderca {{used a variety of}} pseudonyms, including Willy, W. and Oliver, A. Tutova, Clifford Moore, F. Lix, Lix, and N. Popov. He was also using the names Masca de fier ("The Iron Mask"), Masca de catifea ("The Velvet Mask") and Omul cu mască de mătase ("The Man with the Silk Mask").|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{his return}} to Romania, Ralea began {{publishing}} his political and sociological essays in reviews such as Fapta, Ideea <b>Europeană,</b> and Gândirea. He was also involved with Dimitrie Gusti and Virgil Madgearu's Romanian Social Institute, publishing his texts in its Arhiva pentru Știință și Reformă Socială. In 1923, it hosted his essay on [...] "The Issue of Societal Classification" [...] and his critical review of German sociology.|$|E
2500|$|Also in 1923, he debuted as a {{literary}} chronicler and a regular on Felix Aderca's magazine Spre Ziuă. By 1924, he had articles published in leading Romanian magazines: Ideea <b>Europeană,</b> Mişcarea Literară, Cuget Românesc and Camil Petrescu's Săptămâna Muncii Intelectuale şi Artistice. [...] His debut volume of essays, Repertoriu critic ("Critical Repertoire"), was commissioned by the Romanian Orthodox Arad Diocese, saw print in 1925. Perpessicius was by then also noted as an advocate of public causes: his articles reacted against the decision to publicly auction the large art collection of Alexandru Bogdan-Piteşti, a controversial politician and former convict who had bequeathed it to the state.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{focus of}} Isac's {{political}} activity was mediating a Hungarian–Romanian reconciliation, {{both before and}} after the 1919 military conflict, while reaching out to both Hungarians in Hungary and the Hungarian community in Romania. As noted by literary historians John Neubauer and Marcel Cornis-Pope, Isac was one of the Romanian authors who could combine a nationalist outlook with respect for minority cultures: in his articles for the Bucharest-based Ideea <b>Europeană</b> magazine and the Hungarian Napkelet of Cluj, he demanded equal cultural rights for all of Greater Romania's communities. His call to the [...] "great masses" [...] of Romanians and Hungarians, read: [...] "There is only one possible politics in Romania: the politics of true democracy. By its very nature such politics safeguards the rights of everybody, [...] Hungarians, who lead today an isolated life in Transylvania. [...] it is the duty of Romanian writers to initiate divorce proceedings from the negative traditions".|$|E
2500|$|During {{the early}} interwar period, Luca Caragiale was again in Romania, where he frequented the {{literary}} circles. He authored memoirs of his father's life, published in January 1920 by Ideea <b>Europeană</b> journal. Titled Amintiri despre Caragiale ("Memories of Caragiale"), they notably include details about Ion Luca's deep dislike for lyric poetry, {{as well as}} accounts of his aging father's leftist flirtations (from the outrage he felt at learning about the authorities' violence in quelling the 1907 peasants' revolt to his friendship with socialist activist Christian Rakovsky). The same year, he published with Viața Româneascăs sister company a translation of Knut Hamsun's novel Pan. His other translation work covered Edgar Allan Poe, {{as well as the}} poetry of François Villon—he was Romania's first Villon translator, seconded only in the 1930s by Horia Stamatu. In late March 1921, {{he was one of the}} noted witnesses at a Romanian Academy public readings, which included the licentious poem Răsturnica (roughly, [...] "She-tumbler"; from a răsturna, [...] "to tumble"), written, but unsigned, by the avant-garde poet Ion Barbu.|$|E
2500|$|Over those years, Negulescu {{focused his}} {{research}} {{on the history of}} philosophy, as well as one practical and political issues. As noted by Traian Herseni, this new interest was [...] "related to", albeit not in fact identical, to the sociology of culture. Such works include: Reforma învățământului ("Education Reform", 1922), Partidele politice ("The Political Parties", 1926), Geneza formelor culturii ("The Genesis of Cultural Forms", 1934), Academia platonică din Florența ("The Platonic Academy in Florence", 1936), Nicolaus Cusanus (1937) and Destinul Omenirii ("The Destiny of Mankind", Vol. I, 1938; Vol. II, 1939). At the university, Negulescu held a series of courses that were later also published: Enciclopedia filosofiei ("The Encyclopedia of Philosophy", 1924–1926), Istoria filosofiei. Pozitivismul francez contemporan ("A History of Philosophy. Contemporary French Positivism", 1924–1925), Problema ontologică ("The Ontological Issue", 1927–1928), Problema epistemologiei ("The Epistemological Issue", 1930–1932) and Enciclopedia filosofiei. Problema cosmologică ("The Encyclopedia of Philosophy. The Cosmological Issue", 1935–1937). His work was carried in interwar newspapers and magazines, primarily the PP's Îndreptarea, Ideea <b>Europeană,</b> and Revista de Filosofie.|$|E
