60|$|The {{man looked}} at them both {{and there was a}} dull hate <b>gathering</b> in his <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|Iris sighed heavily, Then {{she caught}} her husband's <b>eyes</b> <b>gathering</b> with doubt, {{and she smiled}} again.|$|R
60|$|Virginia {{seemed to}} find speech impossible, {{and it seemed to}} him that he could see the tears <b>gathering</b> in her <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|She faced me, when I {{asked for}} my instructions; and I saw the family frown <b>gathering</b> over her <b>eyes,</b> and the family temper {{twitching}} {{at the corners of}} her mouth.|$|R
6000|$|The {{tears of}} {{gratitude}} that were <b>gathering</b> in Toby's <b>eyes</b> {{prevented him from}} saying anything more, and then Mrs. Treat and Ella both kissed him, while Ben said, in a gruff tone: ...|$|R
60|$|The old {{man could}} not prevent {{the tears from}} <b>gathering</b> in his <b>eyes</b> as he spoke, and both the boys felt an uncomfortably hard lump rise in their throats as he finished.|$|R
60|$|His {{voice had}} grown husky and had fallen {{almost to a}} whisper at the end. They were {{standing}} now, she pale and trembling, tears <b>gathering</b> in her <b>eyes,</b> her fingers clasped together before her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Until you {{saw that}} love had taken the place of ambition!" [...] Tears had been <b>gathering</b> in her <b>eyes</b> whilst he was speaking. Now amazement {{eliminated}} her emotion. [...] "But when did you see that? When?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I am," [...] {{protested the}} King, fresh tears <b>gathering</b> in his <b>eyes.</b> [...] "Even my jokes are miserable. I'm wretched, woeful, afflicted, distressed and dismal as an {{individual}} can be. Are you not sorry for me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is horrid," [...] {{the girl}} said, with tears <b>gathering</b> in her <b>eyes.</b> [...] "I hate King William and King James both," [...] {{she went on}} petulantly. [...] "Why can't they fight their quarrel out alone, instead of troubling {{everyone}} else? I don't know which of them I hate the most." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are welcome}} back--you are welcome back," [...] added Mr. Howel, blowing his nose, {{in order to}} conceal the tears that were <b>gathering</b> in his <b>eyes.</b> [...] "I did think of going to New-York to meet you, but the {{distance}} at my time of life is very serious. Age, gentlemen, {{seems to be a}} stranger to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can do nothing, {{and will}} do nothing," [...] said Robarts. [...] "They may do what they choose--what the law allows them." [...] And then he thought of Fanny and his nursery, and Lucy refusing in her pride Lord Lufton's offer, and he turned away his face that the hard man of the world before him might not see the tear <b>gathering</b> in his <b>eye.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "There is not {{the least}} {{necessity}} for doing anything of the kind," [...] said Marian. [...] "We {{can be just as}} explicit, and much more interesting, by referring to the future." [...] She rose and held up the child kicking and crowing in her arms. [...] "Do you know who this is, Walter?" [...] she asked, with bright tears of happiness <b>gathering</b> in her <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|There {{came that}} kind of pause that happens when a subject is {{broached}} too big and difficult for the <b>gathering.</b> Margaret's blue <b>eyes</b> regarded the speaker with quiet disapproval for a moment, and then {{came to me in}} the not too confident hope that I would snub him out of existence with some prompt rhetorical stroke. A voice spoke out of the big armchair.|$|R
60|$|Thinking thus, desolation {{took hold}} of me and I sat myself down on a rock and covered my face with my hands that I might not see the tears, which I knew were <b>gathering</b> in my <b>eyes,</b> as they fell from them. Yes, there {{in the midst of}} that awful solitude, I, Hubert of Hastings, whose soul it filled, sat down like a lost child and wept.|$|R
6000|$|She paused with this, {{and through}} <b>gathering</b> tears her <b>eyes</b> met his {{as if to}} plead with him to understand. He understood, and drew her closer, but she kept herself free still, to continue: [...] "She was a poor girl--she was only a governess; she was alone, she thought he loved her. He did--I {{think it was the}} only {{happiness}} she ever knew. But she died of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Now I {{was never}} an {{emotional}} person, {{but there was a}} mist <b>gathering</b> before my <b>eyes</b> when at last I saw her. She was dressed in black, and her cheeks had lost all their color. There was a difference even in her tone. She spoke like a woman who has left the world of lighter things behind, and who has vowed her life to a single purpose. The impulse to rush out and take her into my arms was almost irresistible! ...|$|R
6000|$|In the {{distress}} that she caused me I forgot {{the years that}} had passed, and the change they had made in our position towards one another. I moved my chair close to her, and picked up her handkerchief from the carpet, and drew her hands from her face gently. [...] "Don't cry, my love," [...] I said, and dried the tears that were <b>gathering</b> in her <b>eyes</b> with my own hand, {{as if she had}} been the little Laura Fairlie of ten long years ago.|$|R
6000|$|... "She's beastly happy?" [...] {{he broke}} in, getting firmer hold, if {{not of the}} real {{impression}} {{he had just been}} <b>gathering</b> under my <b>eyes,</b> then at least of something he had begun to make out that my argument required. [...] "Well, that is the way I see her difference. Her difference, I mean," [...] he added, in his evident wish to work with me, [...] "her difference from her other difference! There!" [...] He laughed as if, also, he had found himself fairly fantastic. [...] "Isn't that clear for you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She, too, was wan and frail; but {{her eyes}} were bright; her {{movements}} still preserved the elasticity of youth. Her likeness to the elder woman proclaimed their relationship, even before she spoke. [...] "Ah! it's my fault!" [...] she burst out passionately in French. [...] "I was hungry and tired, and I slept hours longer than I ought. My mother was too kind to wake me and set me to work. I am a selfish wretch--and my mother is an angel!" [...] She dashed away the tears <b>gathering</b> in her <b>eyes,</b> and proudly, fiercely, resumed her work.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was strange, and {{a little}} debonnaire, I think,' said Mary, smiling, but tears <b>gathering</b> in her <b>eyes.</b> 'He said I was too good for him. He said he would make me happy, and {{that he and his}} father would be very happy.' A great tear fell. 'Something about not being worthy.' Mary shed a few more tears, while her mother silently caressed her; and, {{recovering}} her composure, she firmly said, 'Yes, mamma, I see it is not the real thing. It will be kinder to him to tell him to put it out of his head.' ...|$|R
60|$|Came {{steps and}} voice, more light, {{flooding}} now the chamber, {{and through the}} mists <b>gathering</b> before his <b>eyes</b> the first-born {{of the house of}} Borgia beheld hurrying men, half dressed, with weapons in their hands. But whether they came to kill or to save, they came too late: Ten times Giovanni's blade had stabbed the Duke, yet, hindered by the Duke's struggles and by the effort of holding him there, he had been unable to find his heart, wherefore, as those others entered now, he slashed his victim across the throat, and so made an end.|$|R
6000|$|While {{prostrate}} here in humble grief I lie, Kind, virtuous drops just <b>gathering</b> in my <b>eye,</b> While praying, trembling, in {{the dust}} I roll, And dawning grace is opening on my soul: [...] 280 Come, if thou dar'st, all charming as thou art! Oppose thyself to heaven; dispute my heart; Come, with one glance of those deluding eyes Blot out each bright idea of the skies; Take back that grace, those sorrows, and those tears; Take back my fruitless penitence and prayers; Snatch me, just mounting, from the blest abode; Assist the fiends, and tear me from my God! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The fool stared, {{with a grin}} {{hovering}} {{about his}} lips, and a scowl <b>gathering</b> over his <b>eyes,</b> as if uncertain whether he might not join in my mirth: whether it were not pleasant familiarity, or what it really was, contempt. I settled his doubts, by suddenly retrieving my gravity and desiring him to walk away, for I came to see Linton, not him. He reddened--I saw that by the moonlight--dropped his hand from the latch, and skulked off, a picture of mortified vanity. He imagined himself to be as accomplished as Linton, I suppose, because he could spell his own name; and was marvellously discomfited that I didn't think the same.' ...|$|R
6000|$|In great {{confusion}} he muttered, [...] "I {{beg your}} pardon," [...] and fled away, dashing his handkerchief over his face. I asked Dora about it, {{but she would}} tell nothing; I believe she was half ashamed, half jealous, but it came round through Miss Woolmer, how throughout the address Harold had sat with {{his eyes fixed on}} the preacher, and one tear after another <b>gathering</b> in his <b>eyes.</b> And when the concluding hymn was sung--one specially on the joys of Paradise--he leant his forehead against the wall, and could hardly suppress his sobs. When all was over, he handed his bag of sweets to one of the Sunday-school teachers, muttering [...] "Give them," [...] and strode home.|$|R
40|$|Automated {{eye-tracking}} {{systems can}} detect and analyze eye movements {{as a means}} to accurately diagnose more than 20 neurological diseases including mild traumatic brain injury. Mild traumatic brain injury is an occurrence of injury to the head resulting from blunt trauma or from acceleration or deceleration forces. Eye movement refers to the voluntary or involuntary movement of the eyes, helping in acquiring, fixating and tracking visual stimuli. There are three types of voluntary eye movement to track objects: smooth pursuit, vergence shifts and saccades. Vergence shifts are eye movements where the eyes move in opposite directions: moving to the midline in convergence or moving away in divergence. This project focused on creating a device to induce vergence eye movements via a laser source and a mirror galvanometer. The laser pointer is directed at the mirror galvanometer which then projects the laser point onto a screen that lies horizontally in front of the observer. As the laser dot moves {{back and forth from the}} viewer, the eyes converge as the dot moves toward the viewer and diverge as the dot moves away. The device will be used to develop a baseline of control data that can eventually be used to diagnose mild traumatic brain injury. Different eye trackers will be tested to determine the optimum technique for <b>gathering</b> vergence <b>eye</b> movement data. [URL]...|$|R
6000|$|But alas! a {{striking}} failure may be reached without tempting Providence {{by any of}} these ambitious tricks. Our own stature will be found high enough for shame. The success of three simple sentences lures us into a fatal parenthesis in the fourth, from whose shut brackets we may never disentangle the thread of our discourse. A momentary flush tempts us into a quotation; and we may be left helpless {{in the middle of}} one of Pope's couplets, a white film <b>gathering</b> before our <b>eyes,</b> and our kind friends charitably trying to cover our disgrace by a feeble round of applause. Amis lecteurs, this is a painful topic. It is possible that we too, we, the [...] "potent, grave, and reverend" [...] editor, may have suffered these things, and drunk as deep as any of the cup of shameful failure. Let us dwell no longer on so delicate a subject.|$|R
60|$|For a year Lawson was happy. He took a {{bungalow}} at {{the point}} of the bay round which Apia is built, on the borders of a native village. It nestled charmingly among the coconut trees and faced the passionate blue of the Pacific. Ethel was lovely as she went about the little house, lithe and graceful like some young animal of the woods, and she was gay. They laughed a great deal. They talked nonsense. Sometimes {{one or two of the}} men at the hotel would come over and spend the evening, and often on a Sunday they would go for a day to some planter who had married a native; now and then one or other of the half-caste traders who had a store in Apia would give a party and they went to it. The half-castes treated Lawson quite differently now. His marriage had made him one of themselves and they called him Bertie. They put their arms through his and smacked him on the back. He liked to see Ethel at these <b>gatherings.</b> Her <b>eyes</b> shone and she laughed. It did him good to see her radiant happiness. Sometimes Ethel's relations would come to the bungalow, old Brevald of course, and her mother, but cousins too, vague native women in Mother Hubbards and men and boys in lava-lavas, with their hair dyed red and their bodies elaborately tattooed. He would find them sitting there when he got back from the bank. He laughed indulgently.|$|R
6000|$|At {{this point}} of the {{conversation}} Mr. Bolton entered the lodge for his evening meal. At the father's appearance, the talk between mother and daughter ceased instantly. Mrs. Bolton caressed and cajoled the surly undertaker's aide-de-camp, and said, [...] "Lor, Mr. B. who'd have thought to see you away from the Club of a Saturday night. Fanny, dear, get your pa some supper. What will you have, B.? The poor gurl's got a <b>gathering</b> in her <b>eye,</b> or somethink in it--I was lookin at it just now as you came in." [...] And she squeezed her daughter's hand as a signal of prudence and secrecy; and Fanny's tears were dried up likewise; and by that wondrous hypocrisy and power of disguise which women practise, and with which weapons of defence nature endows them, the traces of her emotion disappeared; and she went and took her work, and sate in the corner so demure and quiet, that the careless male parent never suspected that anything ailed her.|$|R
500|$|Lawrence's {{breakthrough}} role {{came in the}} small-scale drama Winter's Bone (2010), {{based on}} Daniel Woodrell's novel of the same name. In Debra Granik's independent feature, she portrayed Ree Dolly, a poverty-stricken teenager in the Ozark Mountains who cares for her mentally ill mother and younger siblings while searching for her missing father. Lawrence traveled to the Ozarks a week before filming began {{to live with the}} family on whom the story was based, and in preparation, she learned to fight, skin squirrels, and chop wood. David Denby of The New Yorker said the film [...] "would be unimaginable with anyone less charismatic", and Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "her performance is more than acting, it's a <b>gathering</b> storm. Lawrence's <b>eyes</b> are a roadmap to what's tearing Ree apart." [...] The production won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. The actress was awarded the National Board of Review Award for Breakthrough Performance, and with her first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress, she became the second youngest person to be nominated in the category.|$|R
60|$|When {{the mother}} and son had leisure to look round, {{and there was a}} pleased survey of the boy's height and strength, Goodwife Dolly came forward to beg the lady to come to her fire, and rest under the gipsy tent which she and nephew Piers--her real herd-boy, a rough, shaggy, almost dumb and {{imbecile}} lad--had raised with branches, skins and canvas, to protect their few articles of property. There was a smouldering fire, over which Doll had prepared a rabbit which the dog had caught, and which she had intended for Hal's supper and that of her husband if he came home in time. While the lady lavished thanks upon her for all she had done for the boy she was intent on improving the rude meal, so as to strengthen her mistress after her long walk, and for the return. The lady, however, could see and think of nothing but her son, while he returned her tearful gaze with open <b>eyes,</b> <b>gathering</b> up his old recollections of her.|$|R

40|$|Trends {{of modern}} science {{education}} indicate {{that it is necessary}} to encourage students to understand authentic problems and develop their ability to solve them. In science this is more difficult due to the complexity of science concepts which is reflected in the presentation on the macro, submicro- and symbolic level. The complexity of the science concepts and its impact on teaching, learning and consequently on the ability to solve various science problems are presented in this paper. The formation of the adequate mental model of a specific science concept depends on understanding of all these three levels. The macro level is supposed to be always included in teaching, but the other two depend on the abilities of students, such as their preknowledge and their abstract thinking abilities. Different visualization elements can be used to lower chemical conepts abstractness at submicroscopic level. In recent years, eye tracking has become an increasingly used technique for the monitoring of various processes of learning and problem solving in science education. This technique allows <b>gathering</b> data about <b>eye</b> movements in the information processing, because there are significant correlations between the processes of cognition and eye movements. In this way it can be determinated how students think when exposed the authentic science problem solving, and which factors influence the problem solving...|$|R
6000|$|The sun {{no longer}} shone upon the hillside. The {{shadows of the}} pines were {{beginning}} to creep over Johnson's claim, and the air within the cavern was growing chill. In the <b>gathering</b> darkness his <b>eyes</b> shone brightly as he went on: [...] "Then thar comes a day when we gives a big spread. We invites govners, members o' Congress, gentlemen o' fashion, and the like. And among 'em I invites a Man as holds his head very high, a Man I once knew; but he doesn't know I knows him, and he doesn't remember me. And he comes and he sits opposite me, and I watches him. And he's very airy, this Man, and very chipper, and he wipes his mouth with a white hankercher, and he smiles, and he ketches my eye. And he sez, 'A glass o' wine with you, Mr. Johnson'; and he fills his glass and I fills mine, and we rises. And I heaves that wine, glass and all, right into his damned grinnin' face. And he jumps for me,--for he is very game, this Man, very game,--but some on 'em grabs him, and he sez, 'Who be you?' And I sez, 'Skaggs! damn you, Skaggs! Look at me! Gimme back my wife and child, gimme back the money you stole, gimme back the good name you took away, gimme back the health you ruined, gimme back the last twelve years! Give 'em to me, damn you, quick, before I cuts your heart out!' And naterally, Tommy, he can't do it. And so I cuts his heart out, my boy; I cuts his heart out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O {{never mind}} supper, if I {{can only go}} to bed," [...] sighed Aurelia, sinking on the couch as the old woman hobbled off. Lassitude and {{exhaustion}} had brought her to a state like annihilation--unable to think or guess, hope or fear, with shoes hurting her footsore feet, a stiff dress cramping her too much for sleep, and her weary aching <b>eyes</b> <b>gathering</b> a few impressions in a passive way. On the walls hung dimly seen portraits strangely familiar to her. The man in a green dressing gown with floating hair had a face she knew; so had {{the lady in the}} yellow ruff. And was that not the old crest, the Delavie butterfly, with the motto, Ma Vie et ma Mie, carved on the mantelpiece? Thus she knew that she must be in Delavie House, and felt somewhat less desolate as she recognised several portraits as duplicates of those at the Great House at Carminster, and thought they looked at her in pity with their eyes like her father's. The youngest son in the great family group was, as she knew, an Amyas, and he put her in mind of her own. Oh, was he her own, when she could not tell whether those great soft, dark-grey eyes that looked so kindly on her had descended to the young baronet? She hoped not, for Harriet and she had often agreed that they presaged the fate of that gallant youth, who had been killed by Sir Bevil Grenville's side. He must have looked just as Sir Amyas did, lying senseless after the hurt she had caused.|$|R
