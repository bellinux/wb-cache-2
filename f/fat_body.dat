5|$|Different glands are {{specialized}} {{for different}} pheromones to attract mates. Pheromones from species of Rutelinae are produced from epithelial cells lining the inner {{surface of the}} apical abdominal segments; amino acid-based pheromones of Melolonthinae are produced from eversible glands on the abdominal apex. Other species produce different types of pheromones. Dermestids produce esters, and species of Elateridae produce fatty acid-derived aldehydes and acetates. To attract a mate, fireflies (Lampyridae) use modified <b>fat</b> <b>body</b> cells with transparent surfaces backed with reflective uric acid crystals to produce light by bioluminescence. Light production is highly efficient, by oxidation of luciferin catalyzed by enzymes (luciferases) {{in the presence of}} adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and oxygen, producing oxyluciferin, carbon dioxide, and light.|$|E
5|$|For males, the {{reproductive}} {{system is the}} testis, suspended in the body cavity by tracheae and the <b>fat</b> <b>body.</b> Most male insects have a pair of testes, inside of which are sperm tubes or follicles that are enclosed within a membranous sac. The follicles connect to the vas deferens by the vas efferens, and the two tubular vasa deferentia connect to a median ejaculatory duct {{that leads to the}} outside. A portion of the vas deferens is often enlarged to form the seminal vesicle, which stores the sperm before they are discharged into the female. The seminal vesicles have glandular linings that secrete nutrients for nourishment and maintenance of the sperm. The ejaculatory duct is derived from an invagination of the epidermal cells during development and, as a result, has a cuticular lining. The terminal portion of the ejaculatory duct may be sclerotized to form the intromittent organ, the aedeagus. The remainder of the male reproductive system is derived from embryonic mesoderm, except for the germ cells, or spermatogonia, which descend from the primordial pole cells very early during embryogenesis.|$|E

Despite some minor physiological differences (primarily in the <b>fat</b> <b>body),</b> gyne-destined females produced late in the colony cycle can be induced to become workers if placed on nests that are at an earlier stage of colony development, and the reverse is also true. This indicates a significant degree of flexibility in the caste system of this species.|$|E

50|$|The <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> {{percentage}} (BFP) of a {{human or}} other living being is the total mass of fat divided by total <b>body</b> mass; <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> includes essential <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> and storage <b>body</b> <b>fat.</b> Essential <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> is necessary to maintain life and reproductive functions. The percentage of essential <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> for women is greater than that for men, due {{to the demands of}} childbearing and other hormonal functions. The percentage of essential fat is 2-5% in men, and 10-13% in women (referenced through NASM). Storage <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> consists of fat accumulation in adipose tissue, part of which protects internal organs in the chest and abdomen. The minimum recommended total <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> percentage exceeds the essential fat percentage value reported above. A number of methods are available for determining <b>body</b> <b>fat</b> percentage, such as measurement with calipers or through the use of bioelectrical impedance analysis.|$|R

2500|$|Unlike mammals, Drosophila flies {{only have}} innate {{immunity}} and lack an adaptive immune response. The D. melanogaster immune {{system can be}} divided into two responses: humoral and cell-mediated. The former is a systemic response mediated through the Toll and imd pathways, which are parallel systems for detecting microbes. The Toll pathway in Drosophila is known as the homologue of Toll-like pathways in mammals. Spatzle, a known ligand for the Toll pathway in flies, is produced in response to Gram-positive bacteria, parasites, and fungal infection. Upon infection, pro-Spatzle will be cleaved by protease SPE (Spatzle processing enzyme) to become active Spatzle, which then binds to the Toll receptor located on the cell surface (<b>Fat</b> <b>body,</b> hemocytes) and dimerise for activation of downstream NF-κB signaling pathways. The imd pathway, though, [...] is triggered by Gram-negative bacteria through soluble and surface receptors (PGRP-LE and LC, respectively). D. melanogaster has a [...] "fat body", which is thought to be homologous to the human liver. It is the primary secretory organ and produces antimicrobial peptides. These peptides are secreted into the hemolymph and bind infectious bacteria, killing them by forming pores in their cell walls. Years ago many drug companies wanted to purify these peptides and use them as antibiotics. Other than the <b>fat</b> <b>body,</b> hemocytes, the blood cells in Drosophila, are known as the homologue of mammalian monocyte/macrophages, possessing a significant role in immune responses. It is known from the literature that in response to immune challenge, hemocytes are able to secrete cytokines, for example Spatzle, to activate downstream signaling pathways in the <b>fat</b> <b>body.</b> However, the mechanism still remains unclear.|$|E

We used a green fluorescent protein-expressing baculovirus with wild-type envelope and two pseudotype viruses of which one overexpressed GP 64 and the other expressed a virion protein of a honeybee virus on the envelope.

2500|$|The main {{component}} of the male reproductive system is the testis, suspended in the body cavity by tracheae and the <b>fat</b> <b>body.</b> The more primitive apterygote insects have a single testis, and in some lepidopterans the two maturing testes are secondarily fused into one structure during the later stages of larval development, although the ducts leading from them remain separate.

2500|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{traditional}} low temperature and higher temperature firing techniques {{are used in the}} Guadalajara area, to produce ware from cheap objects to artistic productions. The two main pottery producing municipalities are Tonalá and Tlaquepaque. These two municipalities produce several different types of pottery and ceramics, principally [...] "bruñido", [...] "bandera", [...] "canelo", [...] "petate", [...] "betus" [...] and high-fire/stoneware. The best known of these styles is bruñido, which translates to burnished. It probably descends from polychrome produced in this area en the 19th century. The name {{comes from the fact that}} these pieces are not glazed, but rather they are given a slip and then polished with a stone or pyrite. Many of these pieces are slender necked jugs or lamp bases, often decorated with animals, such as rabbits, with distorted characteristics, giving them a surreal look. The pieces are usually painted with delicate tones of rose, gray-blue and white on a background of a light coffee color, light gray and sometimes green or blue. Each piece is individually created. The attraction of this pottery is its appearance, as it is too porous to hold any liquid or food. One exception to this are thick large tubs mainly to store water or for bathing. Water stored in this kind of vessel takes on a flavor from the pottery, which is desired by some people. Another exception is a water container with a <b>fat</b> <b>body</b> and long neck, with a ceramic cup placed upside down over the neck. These are called botellones, and are similar to carafes. One town that specializes in these is El Rosario, near Tonalá.|$|E
