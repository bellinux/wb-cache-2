50|$|Generally pilots will {{practice}} {{making these}} turns using <b>half</b> <b>standard</b> rate turns. This will decrease the bank angle {{so that it}} is half of the calculated bank angle. When turns are made at <b>half</b> <b>standard</b> rate the line of latitude will only cause the compass to have an error of half as much. So our new calculation using a <b>half</b> <b>standard</b> rate turn is as follows: (From east to north at 90 knots 0+22.5+3.5=26) the lead roll out heading read from the compass would be 26 degrees to fly on a north heading. (From west to north 360-22.5-3.5=334) The lead roll out heading read off the compass would be 334 degrees.|$|E

50|$|A {{standard}} rate turn {{is defined as}} a 3° per second turn, which completes a 360° turn in 2 minutes. This is known as a 2-minute turn, or rate one (180°/min).

50|$|In a {{study by}} Norman et al. about {{health-related}} quality of life surveys, {{it was found that}} most survey results were within a <b>half</b> <b>standard</b> deviation.

Utilizing the Magic Number of 7 ± 2, Miller theorized that when the scale on a survey extends beyond 7 ± 2, humans fail to be consistent and lose ability to differentiate individual steps on the scale because of channel capacity.|$|E
50|$|The Calais International was {{a limited}} edition model {{based on the}} VP Calais and {{released}} in September 1992. A total of 300 were built, 150 in Alaskan White and the same number in Anthracite Grey. All were equipped with the V8 engine and automatic transmission and the exterior featured Commodore SS lower kit (with fog lights) and a Holden VQ Caprice bootlip as well as unique International badges. The paint was single colour, unlike the standard Calais which had a grey lower <b>half.</b> <b>Standard</b> wheels were the 15in alloys from the VQ Statesman but with Holden logo's in the center cap and the interior was black over tan, with tan partial leather/suede seats, and special leather SS style steering wheel.|$|E
50|$|Turns {{made for}} other {{directions}} should be interpolated. For example, {{a left turn}} made from a heading of west to south east (SE). The compass would initially show a heading that is correct as the turn gets closer to south the compass would indicate a lead heading of the greatest error, as the aircraft passes through south the error would decrease and show less of a lead. As the aircraft approaches south east the error would only lead {{half as much as}} it did when the aircraft was rolling through south. So if the turn was made using a <b>half</b> <b>standard</b> rate at 90 knots and the SE heading required to fly was 135 degrees the roll out heading would be 135-11.25+3.5=127 degrees. Hence a roll out heading read from the compass of 127 degrees would be used to actually fly the heading of 135 degrees.|$|E

5000|$|MM.106: Semi-dwarfing — Sometimes {{referred}} to as semi-vigorous, {{this is the most}} widely used of rootstocks. It is probably the best choice for the average garden under average conditions, being tolerant {{of a wide range of}} soils, and producing a tree with an eventual size of 12 to 18 ft. Trees on this stock begin producing fruit within three to four years, and yield 90 to 110 lb after some seven or eight years. MM106 is very suitable for use with weaker varieties that would produce undersized bushes with more dwarfing rootstocks. Can be trained as a <b>half</b> <b>standard</b> tree, but is rather too vigorous for cordons unless the soil is poor. Requires staking for the first four or five years or so of its life. Trees on MM.106 are highly susceptible to collar rot especially when planted in soils that remain wet(poor percolation).|$|E
5000|$|A sten score {{indicates}} an individual's approximate position (as {{a range of}} values) {{with respect to the}} population of values and, therefore, to other people in that population. The individual sten scores are defined by reference to a standard normal distribution. Unlike stanine scores, which have a midpoint of five, sten scores have no midpoint (the midpoint is the value 5.5). Like stanines, individual sten scores are demarcated by <b>half</b> <b>standard</b> deviations. Thus, a sten score of 5 includes all standard scores from -.5 to zero and is centered at -0.25 and a sten score of 4 includes all standard scores from -1.0 to -0.5 and is centered at -0.75. A sten score of 1 includes all standard scores below -2.0. Sten scores of 6-10 [...] "mirror" [...] scores 5-1. The table below shows the standard scores that define stens and the percent of individuals drawn from a normal distribution that would receive sten score.|$|E
50|$|The racial {{achievement}} gap {{has been found}} to exist before students enter kindergarten for their first year of schooling. At the start of kindergarten, Hispanic and black students have math and reading scores substantially lower than those of white students. While both Hispanics and blacks scores have significantly lower test scores than their white counterparts, Hispanic and black have scores that are roughly equal to each other. In a study published in 2009, Reardon and Galindo (2009) specifically examine test scores by race and ethnicity. The data Reardon and Galindo (2009) use comes from the ECLS-K, sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics. The ECLS-K contains data on a nationally representative sample of approximately 21,400 students from the kindergarten class of 1998-1999. Students in the sample were assessed in reading and mathematics skills six times from 1998 to 2004. The content areas of the tests are based on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) fourth-grade content areas, adapted to be age appropriate at each grade level. The assessments were scored using a three-parameter Item Response Theory (IRT) model. Reardon and Galindo (2009) found that average Hispanic and black students begin kindergarten with math scores three quarters of a standard deviation lower than those of white students and with reading scores a <b>half</b> <b>standard</b> deviation lower than those of white students. Six years later, Hispanic-white gaps narrow by roughly a third, whereas black-white gaps widen by about a third. More specifically, the Hispanic-white gap is a <b>half</b> <b>standard</b> deviation in math, and three-eighths in reading at the end of fifth grade. The trends in the Hispanic-white gaps are especially interesting because of the rapid narrowing that occurs between kindergarten and first grade. Specifically, the estimated math gap declines from 0.77 to 0.56 standard deviations, and the estimated reading gap from 0.52 to 0.29 in the roughly 18 months between the fall of kindergarten and the spring of first grade. In the four years from the spring of first grade through the spring of fifth grade, the Hispanic-white gaps narrow slightly to 0.50 standard deviations in math and widening slightly to 0.38 deviations in reading.|$|E

5000|$|The display {{contains}} hash {{marks for}} the pilot's reference during a turn. When the needle is {{lined up with}} a hash mark, the aircraft is performing a [...] "standard rate turn" [...] which is defined as three degrees per second, known in some countries as [...] "rate one". This translates to two minutes per 360 degrees of turn (a complete circle). Indicators are marked as to their sensitivity, with [...] "2 min turn" [...] for those whose hash marks correspond to a standard rate or two-minute turn, and [...] "4 min turn" [...] for those, used in faster aircraft, that show a <b>half</b> <b>standard</b> rate or four-minute turn. The supersonic Concorde jet aircraft and many military jets are examples of aircraft that use 4 min. turn indicators. The hash marks are sometimes called [...] "dog houses", because of their distinct shape on various makes of turn indicators. Under instrument flight rules, using these figures allows a pilot to perform timed turns in order to conform with the required air traffic patterns. For a change of heading of 90 degrees, a turn lasting 30 seconds {{would be required to}} perform a standard rate or [...] "rate one" [...] turn.|$|E
