Its business lines included agricultural equipment, construction equipment, power generation and power transmission <b>equipment,</b> <b>and</b> <b>machinery</b> <b>for</b> use in industrial settings such as factories, flour mills, sawmills, textile mills, steel mills, refineries, mines, and ore mills. The first Allis-Chalmers Company {{was formed in}} 1901 as an amalgamation of the Edward P.

It was reorganized in 1912 as the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company. During the next 70 years its industrial machinery filled countless mills, mines, and factories around the world, and its brand gained fame among consumers mostly from its farm equipment business's orange tractors and silver combine harvesters. In the 1980s and 1990s a series of divestitures transformed the firm and eventually dissolved it. Its successors today are Allis-Chalmers Energy and AGCO.|$|E

Developing products in an environment undergoing technological change is given to frequent failure, even in well-established and sophisticated organizations.

In this study, we analyze the dominant uncertainties associated with the innovation process and modes of innovation of leading <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> <b>machinery</b> producers. <b>For</b> that purpose we analyze the presence and types of risks and uncertainties applied to product innovation, and we test the use of two modes of innovation proposed in recent literature: (1) the Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) mode, which is based on the production and use of codified scientific and technical knowledge, and (2) the Doing, Using, and Interacting (DUI) mode, which relies on informal processes of learning and experience-based know-how. The study is based on an exploratory multiple case study of producers of <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> <b>machinery</b> in the industrial region of Aveiro, Portugal, and carried out under the research "Project Enterprise of the Future" at the University of Aveiro.

40|$|The {{need for}} energy supply, {{particularly}} electricity, {{has been on}} the increase {{in the last two decades}} in developing countries such as Nigeria. Economic and industrial developments have led to this increase in demand for electricity. In universities, much of the electricity consumption is consumed in air conditioning systems, which are used to overcome the indoor thermal discomfort during harsh seasons. An amount of electricity is also consumed by laboratory <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> <b>machinery</b> used <b>for</b> practical <b>and</b> demonstrations. Thus, if universities are to achieve the goals of teaching, research and community service, then proper management of electricity supplied to the system is needed in view of its limited availability. Since electrical energy in Nigeria is highly subsidised by the government, monitoring and controlling the energy consumption pattern in a university is a major aim in the country. However, there is still a lack of information about electricity end-use consumption in Nigerian universities. This paper presents the results of a walk-through energy audit conducted in a university and recommends means of tackling the problem from the demand end by focusing on the areas of potential savings flagged by the energy audit. It was noted that tackling the problem of energy demand from the users’ end is quite challenging, but it might be the only hope of the school in view of inflexibility of supply...|$|R

This is determined by slow accumulation of local funds and constant sufficient flow of capital from Northern regions to the central parts of Russia.

Due to SEZ region managed to obtain stable dynamics of growth of gross regional product, installments to consolidated regional budget, and reduce the number of companies failing to pay wages in time. The Fund of SEZ financed construction of blasting material plant, silver processing line of Kolyma refinery plant; new mining complexes were set in operation.

Increasing environmental pollution come back to the people with boomerang effect both as health problems and economiclosses. Man's production capacity is limited to the sustainability of natural systems. In fact, scientific and technologicaldevelopments may lead to harmful consequences for the environment which is extremely expressed by George Perkins Marsh in 1864 in his work, "Man and Nature". Studies such as Malthus's population, Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring", The Tragedy of theCommons by Garrett Hardin are the ones on environmental protection and the creation of environmental awareness in society inthe direction of the have put forward are working. Come into prominence of urbanization each passing day, rural-urban migration of the population of people living in urbanareas as well as the expectations for increasing the quality of life, dragging the local governments to the new local governments aredragging to the new quests. Today, as a local governing body, municipalities have been observed in lots of studies in manydifferent areas to protect the environment and to prevent environmental pollution. If these are desired to stated in main topics;increasing the quality of air, better managing the water resources, conserving the quality of soil, recovering the flora and fauna,solid waste management and recycling, noise pollution, prevention of municipal issues such as new access to the expansions. Population growth, rising living standards, technological development and the amount of solid waste the city to becomeparallel and variations are increasing with each passing day.

Depending on the changes in consumption habits of people solid wastes in plastic, glass, papercardboardcan be recycled, such as the amount or nature of the waste is increasing day by day. This article about an importantplace in solid waste in a healthy way of assessing whether the recovery of natural resources conservation, energy savings andeconomic reasons have become mandatory. In addition, the industrial revolution and urbanization, as well as excessive consumption of unconscious behavior of today'senvironmental problems were uncovered. The environment for sustainable development is an important location.

People do notadopt the execution of applications is quite difficult. In this context, solid waste and recycling issues by giving weight to practical training, the studies about recovery must extend. Bureaucratic obstacles to be faced by the municipality must remove and the municipality for such applications should beencouraged. In addition, legislation to punish those who acted against the interests of effective implementation of the legislation isnecessary.

40|$|Given {{the great}} number of studies {{focusing}} on the temporal interaction between economic and environmental subsystems, {{it is useful to}} perform a quantitative spatial assessment of these subsystems. In this paper, comprehensive assessment indicators for regional economic development and environmental pollution subsystems are constructed. Then, the degree of coupling and coordination of the regional economy-environment system is calculated for 350 prefectural units in China. It is found that the economic development and environmental pollution in most prefectural units is still at a low level of coupling and coordination. According to the coupling and coordination values, the Chinese territory can be divided into four types of area: economy-environment harmonious area, economy environment gearing area, economy-environment rivaling area and low coupling degree of economy environment area. Based on a structural analysis of the industrial sector in the four types of areas, there is a spatial relationship between the regional industrial sector structure and the coupling-coordination level. In the economy-environment harmonious area, the sectors of manufacturing of high-technology and high value-added products, such as communications, computer <b>and</b> electronic <b>equipment,</b> transport <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> electrical <b>machinery,</b> account <b>for</b> {{a large proportion of the}} value of local industrial output.
