40|$|Voltage-current {{characteristics}} <b>forwardly</b> <b>biased</b> heterojunctions p-GaSe-n-InSe made by {{the method}} of optical contact are analyzed. Asit was ascertained, the forward current is determined by tunnel-recombination processes at low voltages and overbarrier emission. The experimental characteristics are defined by the known theoretical expressions for anisotipical heterojunctions with the energy diagram by Andersen...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{piezoelectric}} potential output of a ZnO wire/belt functionalized with p-type oligomer (2, 5 -Bis(octanoxy) - 1, 4 -bis(4 -formyl phenylene vinylene) benzene) (OPV 2) when it was deflected by an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip in contact mode. In comparison to the ZnO wire/belt without oligomer coating, an extra positive voltage peak was observed prior to {{the appearance of a}} negative potential peak. The paired positive and negative voltage peaks are the results of tip contact to the stretched and the compressed side of the wire/belt, corresponding to the positive and negative local piezoelectric potential, respectively. The p−n junction between OPV 2 and ZnO serves as a “diode ” that controls the flow of current. When the nanowire/nanobelt is first bent by the AFM tip, the diode is reversely biased and the piezoelectric charges are stored in the ZnO wire/belt. As the AFM tip further bends the wire/belt, the local piezoelectric potential is continuously accumulated to a value that is large enough to break through the diode. Then the free charges from the external circuit can flow in and neutralize/screen part of the piezoelectric charges, resulting in a positive pulse in the output signal. When the AFM tip continues to scan to reach the compressed side of the ZnO wire/belt, the p−n junction is <b>forwardly</b> <b>biased.</b> Neutralizing/screening the residual and the newly created piezoelectric charges leads to the flow of current from the tip to the ZnO wire/belt, resulting in a negative voltage pulse. This study supports the charging and discharging model proposed for the piezoelectric nanogenerator. ZnO is a smart material that is widely used in semiconductor industry, and it is a very attractive material for studyin...|$|E
