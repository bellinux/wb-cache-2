40|$|Particle {{shape and}} {{crystallinity}} of flame-generated inorganic aerosols prepared {{in the laboratory}} as well as under 4. 7 seconds of microgravity in the <b>gravity</b> <b>tower</b> have been compared by TEM, EDAX and REM. As starting materials for aerosol generation the metals Sn, Zn, Ag, Cu, Au, Ni, W and a brass alloy were used. Aerosols obtained under microgravity generally exhibit a much higher crystallinity than those from conventional laboratory experiments. While in the laboratory almost exclusively primary particles of globular shape were formed, in the microgravity experiments preferentially fibrous-type particles were obtained. It is planned to direct a further study on the special crystallization mechanism under microgravity.

50|$|Formed in 2008, Liberty Lies {{began with}} Shaun Richards, Josh Pritchett, Adam Stevens and two former members, Matt Jones and Dan Newman. They {{had known each}} other from school and had each been in many {{different}} 'bands' before they got together and started Liberty Lies. As time passed, they spent the next two years rocking up a storm with gigs, competitions and festivals all around the UK. In November 2008, Liberty Lies reached the grand final of 'The Live Band of the Year' competition in Wolverhampton where, with only a small catalogue of original material, they achieved a well deserved second place. As time went on and the band began to grow they managed to get tours with bands such as; Magnum, Black Spiders, Slaves to <b>Gravity,</b> <b>Towers</b> of London and Richie Kotzen.|$|R

Wang asserts that: As indicated by our results, the modified entropic gravity models of form (2), if not killed, should live in a very narrow room to assure the energy-momentum conservation and to accommodate a homogeneous isotropic universe.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} and analytical investigation {{was conducted to}} determine the free surface shapes of circular jets impinging normal to sharp-edged disks in zero gravity. Experiments conducted in a zero <b>gravity</b> drop <b>tower</b> yielded three distinct flow patterns which were classified {{in terms of the}} relative effects of surface tension and inertial forces. An order of magnitude analysis was conducted indicating regions where viscous forces were not significant when computing free surface shapes. The free surface analysis was simplified by transforming the governing potential flow equations and boundary conditions into the inverse plane. The resulting nonlinear equations were solved numerically and comparisons were made with the experimental data for the inertia dominated regime...|$|R

40|$|Thermal {{states of}} quantum systems with many {{degrees of freedom}} are subject to a bound on the rate of onset of chaos, {{including}} a bound on the Lyapunov exponent, λ_L≤ 2 π /β. We harness this bound to constrain the space of putative holographic CFTs and their would-be dual theories of AdS gravity. First, by studying out-of-time-order four-point functions, we discuss how λ_L= 2 π/β in ordinary two-dimensional holographic CFTs is related to properties of the OPE at strong coupling. We then rule out the existence of unitary, sparse two-dimensional CFTs with large central charge {{and a set of}} higher spin currents of bounded spin; this implies the inconsistency of weakly coupled AdS_ 3 higher spin <b>gravities</b> without infinite <b>towers</b> of gauge fields, such as the SL(N) theories. This fits naturally with the structure of higher-dimensional <b>gravity,</b> where finite <b>towers</b> of higher spin fields lead to acausality. On the other hand, unitary CFTs with classical W_∞[λ] symmetry, dual to 3 D Vasiliev or hs[λ] higher spin gravities, do not violate the chaos bound, instead exhibiting no chaos: λ_L= 0. Independently, we show that such theories violate unitarity for |λ|> 2. These results encourage a tensionless string theory interpretation of the 3 D Vasiliev theory. We also perform some CFT calculations of chaos in Rindler space in various dimensions. Comment: 50 + 18 pages. v 3 : Section 3 clarified and reorganized, related improvement...|$|R
40|$|It {{was shown}} {{experimentally}} that the Marangoni phenomenon {{is a primary}} mechanism for the movement of a gas bubble in a nonisothermal liquid in a low gravity environment. A mathematical model consisting of the Navier-Stokes and thermal energy equations, together with the appropriate boundary conditions for both media, is presented. Parameter perturbation theory is used to solve this boundary value problem; the expansion parameter is the Marangoni number. The zeroth, first, and second order approximations for the velocity, temperature and pressure distributions in the liquid and in the bubble, and the deformation and terminal velocity of the bubble are determined. Experimental zero gravity data for a nitrogen bubble in ethylene glycol, ethanol, and silicone oil subjected to a linear temperature gradient were obtained using the NASA Lewis zero <b>gravity</b> drop <b>tower.</b> Comparison of the zeroth order analytical results for the bubble terminal velocity showed good agreement with the experimental measurements. The first and second order solutions for the bubble deformation and bubble terminal velocity are valid for liquids having Prandtl numbers {{on the order of}} one, but {{there is a lack of}} appropriate data to test the theory fully...|$|R
40|$|The {{industrial}} and commercial development of space-related activities is intimately {{linked to the}} ability to conduct reduced gravity research. Reduced gravity experimentation is important to many diverse fields of research in the understanding of fundamental and applied aspects of physical phenomena. Both terrestrial and extra-terrestrial experimental facilities are currently available to allow researchers access to reduced gravity environments. This paper discusses two drop tower designs, a 2. 0 second facility built in Australia and a proposed 2. 2 second facility in the United Kingdom. Both drop towers utilise a drag shield for isolating the falling experiment from the drag forces of the air during the test. The design and development of The University of Queensland’s (Australia) 2. 0 second drop tower, including its specifications and operational procedures is discussed first. Sensitive aspects of the design process are examined. Future plans are then presented for a new short duration (2. 2 sec) ground-based reduced <b>gravity</b> drop <b>tower.</b> The new drop tower has been designed for Kingston University (United Kingdom) to support teaching and research in the field of reduced gravity physics. The design has been informed by the previous UQ drop tower design process and utilises a catapult mechanism to increase test time and also incorporates features to allow participants for a variety of backgrounds (from high school students through to university researchers) to learn and experiment in reduced gravity. Operational performance expectations for this new facility are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Recently, gravity {{measurements}} {{were made on}} a tall, very stable television transmitting tower in order to detect a non-Newtonian gravitational force. This experiment required the upward continuation of gravity from the Earth's surface to points as high as only 600 m above ground. The upward continuation {{was based on a}} set of gravity anomalies {{in the vicinity of the}} tower whose data distribution exhibits essential circular symmetry and appropriate radial attenuation. Two methods were applied to perform the upward continuation - least-squares solution of a local harmonic expansion and least-squares collocation. Both methods yield comparable results, and have estimated accuracies on the order of 50 microGal or better (1 microGal = 10 (exp - 8) m/sq s). This order of accuracy is commensurate with the <b>tower</b> <b>gravity</b> measurments (which have an estimated accuracy of 20 microGal), and enabled a definitive detection of non-Newtonian gravity. As expected, such precise upward continuations require very dense data near the tower. Less expected was the requirement of data (though sparse) up to 220 km away from the tower (in the case that only an ellipsoidal reference gravity is applied) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{clockwork}} {{mechanism for}} <b>gravity</b> introduces a <b>tower</b> of massive graviton modes, "clockwork gravitons," {{with a very}} compressed mass spectrum, whose interaction strengths are much stronger than that of massless gravitons. In this work, we compute the lowest order contributions of the clockwork gravitons to the anomalous magnetic moment, g- 2, of muon {{in the context of}} extra dimensional model with a five dimensional Planck mass, M_ 5. We find that the total contributions are rather insensitive to the detailed model parameters, and determined mostly by the value of M_ 5. In order to account for the current muon g- 2 anomaly, M_ 5 should be around 0. 2 TeV, {{and the size of the}} extra dimension has to be quite large, l_ 5 ≳ 10 ^- 7 m. For M_ 5 ≳ 1 TeV, the clockwork graviton contributions are too small to explain the current muon g- 2 anomaly. We also compare the clockwork graviton contributions with other extra dimension models such as Randall-Sundrum models or large extra dimension models. We find that the leading contributions in the small curvature limit are universal, but the cutoff-independent subleading contributions vary for different background geometries and the clockwork geometry gives the smallest subleading contributions.
