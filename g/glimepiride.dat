50|$|Glycemic {{variability}} {{and chronic}} sustained hyperglycemia {{are the main}} components of dysglycemia in diabetes. The previous studies suggested that different pharmacodynamic profiles between DPP-4 inhibitors have been associated with the different effects on glycemic variability. In this study, a multicenter, randomized, active-controlled, parallel group, open-label, exploratory study was designed to evaluate the efficacy on glycemic variability and safety of initial combination therapy of gemigliptin 50 mg qd versus sitagliptin 100 mg qd, or <b>glimepiride</b> 2 mg qd with metformin in patients with T2DM (study identifier: LG-DPCL012, STABLE study; ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT01890629). The mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) and SD of glucose were used for assessing glucose fluctuations from the baseline after 12 weeks of treatment. At 12 weeks, MAGE was significantly lower in the DPP-4 inhibitor groups (gemigliptin and sitagliptin) than in the <b>glimepiride</b> group (-43.1, -38.3, and -21.7 mg/dL, respectively).

When added to metformin, canagliflozin daily was shown to be non-inferior to both sitagliptin 100 mg daily and <b>glimepiride</b> in reducing HbA1c levels at one year, whilst canagliflozin 300 mg successfully demonstrated statistical superiority over both sitagliptin and glimiperide in decreasing HbA1c levels. Secondary efficacy endpoints of higher reductions in weight and blood pressure (versus sitagliptin and glimiperide) were also observed in studies. Canagliflozin produces beneficial effects on HDL cholesterol whilst increasing LDL cholesterol to produce no change in total cholesterol.|$|E
40|$|We {{considered}} poly(esteramide) hyperbranched polymers (trade names: Hybrane S 1200 and Hybrane HA 1690) as enhancers of <b>glimepiride</b> solubility and therewithassociated dissolution rate. We prepared solid dispersions (SD) of <b>glimepiride</b> with hyperbranched polymers (HB) {{and compared}} their solubility {{with those of}} crystalline and amorphous <b>glimepiride</b> {{as well as with}} the solubility of SD of glimepridie with conventional linear polymers, i. ie. Poly(ethylene glycol) and Gelucire (stearoyl macroglyceride) s. Since the solubility and dissolution rate depend also on <b>glimepiride</b> crystallinity we characterized the morphology of solid dispersions by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis. The nature of molecular interactions involved in complexation of <b>glimepiride</b> with HB was studied by infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The comparison of the results of in-vitro dissolution studies show that SD based on poly(ester amide) HB polymers showed significantly enhanced aqueous solubility of <b>glimepiride</b> and its dissolution rate as compared to <b>glimepiride</b> in crystalline or amorphous form as well as its SD with conventional linear polymers. We also calculated the amount of <b>glimepiride</b> complexed with particular HB polymer (loading capacity) in SD using dissolution results. The loading capacity for both HB polymers was estimated to be around 5 %, w/w of <b>glimepiride.</b> SD containing higher amounts of <b>glimepiride</b> appear to be oversaturated, so that non-complexed <b>glimepiride</b> crystallizes as a separate solid phase during the solvent evaporation. X-ray diffraction studies confirmed calculated loading capacity. IR results indicated that <b>glimepiride</b> forms complexes with HB polymers through hydrogen bonds between the NH groups of <b>glimepiride</b> and carbonyls of ester (O) -C=O and amide (N) -C=O groups of HB polymers. Therefore, the improved <b>glimepiride</b> solubility was ascribed to complex formation between <b>glimepiride</b> and HB polymers...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} metoclopramide, domperidone and erythromycin on blood glucose and serum insulin levels, gastrointestinal motility and carbohydrate absorption in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice treated with <b>glimepiride.</b> Design and methods: Effects of the individual as well as combined drugs were studied in diabetic mice via estimation of the blood glucose and serum insulin levels, small intestinal transit, gastric emptying, xylose and glucose absorption tests. Diabetic groups were treated with <b>glimepiride</b> (10  mg/kg p. o.), metoclopramide (20  mg/kg p. o.), domperidone (20  mg/kg p. o.) or erythromycin (6  mg/kg p. o.) individually or in combination. Results: The test prokinetic drugs metoclopramide (20  mg/kg), domperidone (20  mg/kg) and erythromycin (6  mg/kg) were effective in decreasing small intestinal transit, enhancing gastric emptying and increasing xylose absorption from the GIT in STZ-induced diabetic mice as compared to diabetic control value. Metoclopramide or erythromycin potentiated the effect of <b>glimepiride</b> (10  mg/kg) on blood glucose level and serum insulin level after repeated dose administration in diabetic mice. <b>Glimepiride</b> (10  mg/kg) significantly decreased small intestinal transit and enhanced gastric emptying in diabetic mice {{as compared to the}} diabetic control group. Administration of metoclopramide, domperidone or erythromycin with <b>glimepiride</b> partially antagonized the action of <b>glimepiride</b> on small intestinal transit and gastric emptying in diabetic mice. Administration of metoclopramide, domperidone or erythromycin along with <b>glimepiride</b> significantly increased xylose and glucose absorption as compared to the <b>glimepiride</b> treated group. Conclusion: Use of metoclopramide, domperidone or erythromycin with <b>glimepiride</b> may guard against the risk of gastrointestinal motility disturbance associated with <b>glimepiride</b> treated diabetic patients and may enhance the absorption of carbohydrates. The dose of <b>glimepiride</b> may be safely decreased when combined with erythromycin or metoclopramide...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{performed}} to evaluate the effect of <b>glimepiride,</b> Vanadyl Sulfate (VOSO 4) or their combination on glycemic status and oxidative stress in STZ-diabetic rats and to investigate the possible mechanism of action of these drugs. Another {{aim of this study}} is to determine whether there is a possible interaction between certain chosen trace element (VOSO 4) and <b>glimepiride</b> as representative to oral hypoglycemic agents. Treatment of STZ-diabetic animals with <b>glimepiride</b> (10 mg/kg, p. o.) or VOSO 4 (15 mg/kg, i. p.) decreased serum glucose level and increased liver glycogen content. <b>Glimepiride</b> increased serum insulin level and glucose (6 mmol/L) -stimulated insulin secretion from isolated rat pancreatic islets. Vanadyl sulfate did not affect serum insulin level or glucose (6 mmol/L) -stimulated insulin secretion from isolated rat pancreatic islets. <b>Glimepiride</b> and VOSO 4 increased plasma GSH level, plasma SOD level and decreased serum TBARS level. Combination of VOSO 4 with <b>glimepiride</b> did not improve the effect of <b>glimepiride</b> alone on any of the measured parameters when given in the selected doses indicating no significant interaction between these two drugs on the selected parameters. It could be concluded that concurrent administration of VOSO 4 with <b>glimepiride</b> does not produce any additive effect on any of the measured parameters. Therefore, VOSO 4 can be taken safely as a micronutrient in diabetic patient treated with <b>glimepiride</b> without fear of any serious reactions...|$|E

40|$|Aims: To {{compare the}} effects of {{vildagliptin}} with those of <b>glimepiride</b> on glycaemic control, fat tolerance and inflammatory markers in people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving metformin treatment. Methods: A total of 167 participants were randomized to vildagliptin 50  mg twice a day or <b>glimepiride</b> 2  mg three times a day, for 6  months. We evaluated the following variables: BMI; glycaemic control; fasting plasma insulin; homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance index; fasting plasma proinsulin; glucagon; lipid profile adiponectin; high-sensitivity C-reactive protein; interleukin- 6; and tumour necrosis factor-α. A euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp procedure and an oral fat load test were also performed. Results: Despite a similar decrease in HbA 1 c levels (P =  0. 009, and P =  0. 008, respectively), body weight increased with <b>glimepiride</b> (P =  0. 048 vs baseline) and decreased with vildagliptin (P =  0. 041 vs baseline and vs <b>glimepiride).</b> Fasting plasma insulin and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance index were significantly lower with vildagliptin compared with <b>glimepiride</b> (P =  0. 035 and 0. 047). M value, an index of insulin sensitivity, increased with vildagliptin, both compared with baseline and with <b>glimepiride</b> (P =  0. 028 and 0. 039, respectively). Vildagliptin improved all post-oral fat load peaks of lipid profile compared with <b>glimepiride.</b> Adiponectin levels were higher (P =  0. 035) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels were lower (P =  0. 038) with vildagliptin vs <b>glimepiride.</b> During the oral fat load test, interleukin- 6, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and tumour necrosis factor-α peaks were lower and adiponectin peak was higher in the vildagliptin group than in the <b>glimepiride</b> group. There was a higher dropout rate {{as a result of}} hypoglycaemia in the <b>glimepiride</b> group than in the vildagliptin group.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{feasibility}} of using hyperbranched polymers with highly branched structure {{and a large number}} of functional groups as solubilization enhancers for poorly water-soluble drugs. Antidiabetic drug <b>glimepiride</b> was used as a model drug and commercially available hyperbranched poly(esteramide) s as drug carriers. The results of in vitro dissolution studies showed significantly enhanced aqueous-solubility of <b>glimepiride</b> in the form of solid dispersions with hyperbranched poly(esteramide) s as compared to pure <b>glimepiride</b> in crystalline or amorphous form. The results of IR spectroscopic measurements revealed that improved solubility is a consequence of a complex formation between <b>glimepiride</b> and hyperbranched polymer. HB poly(esteramide) s with carbonyls of ester (O) -Cdouble bondlength as m-dashO and amide (N) -Cdouble bondlength as m-dashO groups serve mainly as a source of proton acceptor groups to which NH groups of <b>glimepiride</b> establish hydrogen bonds.

Standard solution of <b>glimepiride</b> (1 mg/mL) and Sorbfil chromatographic plates were used for thin-layer chromatography. The thin-layer chromatography studies showed that the best mobile phase was chloroform:acetone (9 : 1), Rf value of <b>glimepiride</b> in five examinations was 0. 37 ± 0. 02. Visualization of <b>glimepiride</b> was achieved byspraying with Dragendorff’s, Bushard’s, or diphenylcarbazone-chloroform solution followed by mercuric sulphate. The limit of detection of pure <b>glimepiride</b> by thin-layer chromatography was 0. 5 p/mL, 1. 5 p g/mL in whole blood and 1. 0 p g/mL in urine. For spectrophotometric determinations of <b>glimepiride,</b> a UV/VIS spectrophotometer with 1 cm matches quartz cell was used.
