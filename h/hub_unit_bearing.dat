40|$|Load Sensing Bearing (LSB) {{units are}} based on the {{measurement}} of the elastic deformation of the outer ring of the <b>bearing</b> <b>unit</b> usually using strain gauges which are placed along the circumference of the bearing. The master thesis is aimed at estimating the lateral tire force of a vehicle wheel using the vehicle wheel <b>bearing</b> <b>hub</b> <b>unit</b> which is instrumented to become a LSB and is placed in a BMW E 60 lab vehicle. Calibration of the LSB is needed to obtain a strain-force model. In situ calibration is expensive, time consuming and not always possible. Therefore a calibration system, the Bearing Test System (BETSY) has been used. Sensor responses of the LSB are greatly influenced by differences in bearing housing compliance where on one hand the LSB is mounted on the machine {{and on the other hand}} in the vehicle. It will be shown how it is possible to use BETSY as calibration system when the LSB is mounted to machine via the actual knuckle and ball joints found in the vehicle. Next, a Multivariate Linear Regression Analysis (MLRA) is used to obtain a strain-force model to estimate the lateral force. However, the strain gauges are subjected to thermal influences of a low frequent nature and can therefore only be used to estimate the ‘high’- frequent lateral force. Besides that, it is not possible with the specific compact wheel <b>hub</b> <b>unit</b> of the BMW E 60 lab vehicle to determine, with the strain gauges, whether the vehicle is turning left or right. To overcome these two issues, two Eddy-current sensors measuring the tilting movement of the ABS-ring, which is integrated in the seal of the bearing, are used to determine the direction and to estimate the low frequent content of the lateral force. Calibration and validation experiments are performed to show the accuracy and precision of the lateral force estimation.

40|$|Rapid {{growth in}} {{automotive}} sector and stringent safety requirements {{have led to}} the need for more sophisticated feedback mechanisms for the vehicle systems. One of the major breakthrough is anticipated with the use of estimated loads with help of a Load Sensing Bearing. Load Sensing Bearing is a concept in which strain is measured on a <b>hub</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>unit</b> with help of strain gauges and this measured strain is used to estimate the load generated between the road surface and the tire. Different kind of algorithms to estimate the load from the measured strain on a bearing are found in literature. These algorithms are based on the signal analysis and filtering of the measured strain signals. Moreover, the position of strain gauges to measure the strain on bearing are decided based on the intuition. It is expected that if the model of the internal load distribution of a bearing is included in the estimation process, in conjunction with the measured strain, the developed algorithm can give more accurate estimation of a load. A methodological approach of estimating an applied moving load from the measured strain and using the information of a load distribution is developed using a representative beam model. Also, the effect of different parameters affecting the estimation of load is quantified using the strain-load relation. To get an estimation of an applied moving load on an average sense, least square analyses were introduced. It was found that if the information of the uncertainties in parameters is included to estimate the load with help of the Weighted Least Square, the results were significantly improved. Further, in absence of the information about the uncertainty in parameters, usefulness of the iterative reweighting least square – a heuristic least square method – is also checked. Least square methods also gave insight to the suitability of different strain measurement positions by the measure of a goodness of fit. It is concluded that if the information of load distribution and uncertainty in parameter is used, in addition to the measured strain, to estimate the applied moving load; the resulting estimation is accurate up to 2. 5 % with 95 % confidence bounds for a certain strain measurement positions using Weighted Least Square method. This methodology will be useful for further exploration in the field of a Load Sensing Bearing to improve the load estimation and as well as to formulate the optimization strategy for the placement of strain gauges on the bearing.
