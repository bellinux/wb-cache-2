5|$|At any size, a meat ant nest {{always has}} a {{possibility}} of dying out in any year, but the site may be reoccupied by another colony. Hence, nests can be very old as suggested in one study. Some nests may never be reoccupied for unknown reasons. The regrowth of vegetation which shades the nest, soil damage or even a disease may wipe out a colony and leave the nest site completely abandoned. The death of a colony may be obvious when competing colonies increase in population and size by expanding their territories with well-established satellite nests in order exploit the food sources once used by a former colony. Satellite nests may diverge from their parent nests to become independent, {{as suggested by the}} antagonism of worker ants from different nests or when others are uninhabitable by <b>insecticide</b> <b>treatment.</b> After the eradication of a nest, satellite nests emerge nearby, and may sever their connections with the parent nest. The separation of a satellite nest is an effective way for a nest to exploit food sources, and a colony with less than 11 entrance holes is recognised as non-mature (a nest is mature at 12). As most satellite nests have 11 holes and accept a queen of their own, a satellite nest may easily develop maturity in one year.|$|E

40|$|Although, to date, {{the emerald}} ash borer (EAB) {{has not been}} {{discovered}} in Wisconsin, many questions have been asked by homeowners and Green industry professionals regarding the capability and need of insecticides for protecting ash trees from EAB.

Research and experience has shown that insecticides can protect ash trees from being killed by EAB. However, success in not guaranteed! In some university trials, <b>insecticide</b> <b>treatments</b> were effective, but in other trials the same treatments failed. Some studies conducted over multiple years revealed that EAB infestations continued to increase despite ongoing <b>treatment</b> programs. <b>Insecticides</b> are not effective in eradicating EAB infestations, which is why they have not been used as an eradication tool by the Cooperative EAB program in other states.

It is important to understand that <b>insecticide</b> <b>treatments</b> must be repeated each year. As a result, in some cases, it may be more cost-effective to remove and replace the tree. There are several insecticide options available for those people who want to treat their trees. It is important to understand that controlling wood-boring insects with insecticides has always been a difficult proposition. This is especially true with EAB because our native North American ash trees have no natural resistance to this pest.

Field observation, noted that <b>insecticide</b> seed <b>treatments</b> used in rice could potentially reduce the effects of off-target movement of herbicides onto rice crops and possibly reduce the negative effects of some herbicides applied directly to rice. Research was conducted to determine if <b>insecticide</b> seed <b>treatments</b> could reduce the harmful effects of drift from imazethapyr and glyphosate onto conventional rice, and if so, which <b>insecticide</b> seed <b>treatments</b> provided adequate protection. In addition, research was conducted to determine if thiamethoxam, a popular <b>insecticide</b> seed <b>treatment,</b> could reduce the negative effects of some acetolactate synthase (ALS) -inhibiting, preemergence and postemergence herbicides for better or future use in rice.

However, little is known about how the pesticides affect the microbial community in cucumber phyllosphere. This study was the first attempt to assess the impact of pyrethroid insecticide cyperemethrin on the microbial communities of cucumber phyllosphere using biochemical and genetic approaches. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) assay indicated that cyperemethrin <b>insecticide</b> <b>treatment</b> led to a significant increase in both total and bacterial biomass and a decrease in fungal biomass and the ratio of Gram-positive (GP) bacteria to Gram-negative (GN) bacteria within the cucumber phyllosphere. Principal-component analyses (PCA) suggested that the number of unsaturated and cyclopropane PLFAs (16 : 1 omega 9 t, 18 : 1 omega 7, cy 17 : 0, cy 19 : 0) increased with the <b>insecticide</b> <b>treatment,</b> whereas the saturated PLFA i 16 : 0, i 17 : 0 decreased. The increase of GN bacteria implied that the cypermethrin insecticide might be a nutrient for the growth of these phyllosphere microbes.
