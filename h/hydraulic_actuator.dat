However, large frictional forces in <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuators,</b> rotary <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuators</b> in particular, degrade the control performance. To suppress frictional forces and increase robustness against modeling errors, this study considered the integration of feedback modulators (with minimum control inputs exceeding static frictional forces) with disturbance observers. In the proposed controller, nonlinear static frictional forces are suppressed by the feedback modulators and linear disturbances are suppressed by the disturbance observers. The validity was experimentally verified in this study.|$|R

40|$|While {{there is}} a wide range of {{actuation}} technologies, none currently rivals the overall performance (power density, bandwidth, stress, stroke) of conventional hydraulic actuation. It is well known in the actuation community that the power-to-weight ratios and the power-to-volume ratios of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuators</b> are, respectively, around 5 times and 10 to 20 times larger than comparable electric motors. Due to fundamental limitations in the magnetic flux density in the supporting structures and limitations in the heat transfer out of electric actuators, significant changes in these ratios are not likely in the near future. Thermal limitations associated with electric motors do no apply to <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuators</b> since the <b>hydraulic</b> fluid cools and lubricates the system. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>actuators</b> are capable of holding a load without any energy expenditure, resilient to high impact loads, and typically do no need a transmission system. However, with all of these virtues, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuators</b> have serious practical implementation problems. Typically, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuators</b> have moderate to poor reliability when compared to electric actuators, leaky (at least in reputation), poor energy efficiencies and poor controllability due to either overlapping or underlapping in the spool of the control valves.

Their purpose is also to raise control system survivability by eliminating the long pipeline communications and their replacing for the electro-conductive power supply system, thus reducing the vulnerability of systems. The main reason for a delayed application of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuators</b> in the cutting-edge aircrafts was that such aircrafts require <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuators</b> of considerably higher power with considerable heat releases, which caused an unacceptable overheat of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuators.</b> Positive and negative sides of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuators,</b> their alternative options of increased reliability and survivability, local hydraulic systems as an advanced alternative to independent <b>hydraulic</b> <b>actuators</b> are considered.
