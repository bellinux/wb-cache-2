Methods and materials: This retrospective study enrolled 30  subjects diagnosed with conjunctivochalasis. Complete ophthalmic examination, including visual acuity assessment, slit-lamp examination, applanation tonometry, dilated funduscopy, tear break-up time, Schirmer 1  test, and fluorescein staining were performed in all patients. Age, sex, laterality, ocular history, symptoms, and clinical findings were recorded. Results: The study included 50  eyes from 30  cases. Ages ranged from 45  to 80  years, {{with a mean age}} of 65 ± 10  years. CChs grading were as follows: 30  (60 %) eyes with grade 1  CCh; 15  (30 %) eyes with grade 2  CCh; and five (10 %) eyes with grade 3  CCh. CCh was located in the inferior bulbar conjunctiva in 45  (90 %) eyes, and in the remaining five (10 %) CCh was located in the superior bulbar conjunctiva. Ten (33. 3 %) patients had no symptoms. <b>Dryness,</b> <b>eye</b> pain, redness, blurry vision, tired eye feeling, and epiphora were the symptoms encountered in the remaining twenty (63. 6 %) patients. Altered tear meniscus was noted in all cases. The mean tear break-up time was 7. 6  seconds. The mean Schirmer 1  test score was 7  mm. Pinguecula was found in ten patients. Conclusion: <b>Dryness,</b> <b>eye</b> pain, redness, blurry vision, and epiphora were the main symptoms in patients with CCh. <b>Dryness,</b> <b>eye</b> pain, and blurry vision were worsened during downgaze and blinking.

40|$|Background: The use of {{sedation}} {{and muscle}} relaxants can predispose {{intensive care unit}} (ICU) patients to poor eyelid closure and eye disorders. These complications may not get the nursing care and attention that they require; this and the predisposing factors need to be further investigated. Aims and objectives: The aim of this audit was to use the standard eye-care technique and determine the incidence of <b>eye</b> <b>dryness</b> and corneal abrasion, on day 5 after admission, in comatose patients in the ICU. Design and methods: This was an audit, in the four ICUs in two teaching hospitals in the cities of Kashan and Tehran. An ophthalmologist examined the corneal abrasion and <b>eye</b> <b>dryness</b> {{on the day of}} admission and then day 5. The eye-care method and other variables such as sex and age were also recorded. Statistical tests of Ï� 2, spearman and multiple linear regressions were used to determine the relationships between variables. Results: Eighty-seven patients participated in the audit. On day 5, 28 patients (32 Â· 2) had dry eyes and 12 patients had developed corneal abrasion (13 Â· 8). The mean of Schirmer tear value on admission was 21 Â± 4 Â· 5 mm. This value decreased to 16 Â· 1 Â± 5 Â· 6 mm on day 5. About 10 Â· 3 of patients who received eye lubricant products, and 20 Â· 7 of those receiving adhesive tape as eye-care method developed corneal abrasion. Conclusions: Corneal abrasion and <b>eye</b> <b>dryness</b> were common problems in ICU patients. <b>Eye</b> <b>dryness</b> was the main risk factor for the development of corneal abrasion. Patients receiving adhesive tape as an eye-care method were twice more likely to develop corneal abrasion. Relevance to clinical practice: Eye care and eye assessment should be essential parts of nursing care for patients in ICU. To prevent corneal abrasion, using eye lubricants is more effective than closing eyes by adhesive tape. Â© 2013 British Association of Critical Care Nurses...|$|E

We report {{the results of}} OPUS- 2, a phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of lifitegrast compared with placebo {{for the treatment of}} DED. DesignA 12 -week, multicenter, randomized, prospective, double-masked, placebo-controlled clinical trial. ParticipantsAdults aged ≥ 18 years with use of artificial tears within 30 days, inferior corneal staining score ≥ 0. 5 (0 – 4 scale), Schirmer tear test (without anesthesia) ≥ 1 and ≤ 10 mm, and <b>eye</b> <b>dryness</b> score ≥ 40 (0 – 100 visual analogue scale [VAS]). MethodsSubjects were randomized 1 : 1 after 14 -day placebo run-in to lifitegrast ophthalmic solution 5. 0 % or placebo twice daily for 84 days. Main Outcome MeasuresCo-primary efficacy end points were change, from baseline to day 84, in <b>eye</b> <b>dryness</b> score (VAS, both eyes) and inferior corneal fluorescein staining score in the designated study eye. Secondary end points were change, from baseline to day 84, in ocular discomfort score (0 – 4 scale) in study eye, eye discomfort score (VAS), total corneal staining score in the study eye, and nasal conjunctival lissamine green staining score (0 – 4 scale) in the study eye. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were recorded. ResultsA total of 718 subjects were randomized: placebo, n = 360; lifitegrast, n = 358 (intent-to-treat population). Lifitegrast-treated subjects experienced greater improvement in <b>eye</b> <b>dryness</b> than placebo-treated subjects (treatment effect, 12. 61; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 8. 51 – 16. 70; P < 0. 0001). There was no between-group difference in inferior corneal staining (treatment effect, 0. 03; 95 % CI, − 0. 10 to 0. 17; P = 0. 6186). There was nominally significant improvement of secondary symptom end points among lifitegrast-treated subjects: ocular discomfort (nominal P = 0. 0005) and eye discomfort (nominal, P < 0. 0001). There were no between-group differences on secondary signs: total corneal staining and nasal lissamine staining.

40|$|Dry {{eye disease}} (DED) {{is one of}} the most common ocular disorders, {{affecting}} 10 – 30 % of the population [1].

40|$|Charles P Semba, 1 Thomas R Gadek 2 1 Vascular and Interventional Radiology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA; 2 Ophthalma Logic Consulting, Park City, UT, USA Abstract: Dry {{eye disease}} (DED) is a multifactorial {{disorder}} of the ocular surface characterized by symptoms of discomfort, decreased tear quality, and chronic inflammation that affects an estimated 20 million {{patients in the}} US alone. DED is associated with localized inflammation of the ocular surface and periocular tissues leading to homing and activation of T cells, cytokine release, and development of hyperosmolar tears. This inflammatory milieu results in symptoms of <b>eye</b> <b>dryness</b> and discomfort. Homing of T cells to the ocular surface {{is influenced by the}} binding of lymphocyte function-associated antigen- 1 (LFA- 1; CD 11 a/CD 18; αLβ 2), a cell surface adhesion protein, to its cognate ligand, intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1; CD 54), which is expressed on inflamed ocular/periocular epithelium and vascular endothelium. LFA- 1 /ICAM- 1 binding within the immunologic synapse enables both T-cell activation and cytokine release. Lifitegrast is a novel T-cell integrin antagonist that is designed to mimic the binding epitope of ICAM- 1. It serves as a molecular decoy to block the binding of LFA- 1 /ICAM- 1 and inhibits the downstream inflammatory process. In vitro studies have demonstrated that lifitegrast inhibits T-cell adhesion to ICAM- 1 -expressing cells and inhibits secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha, interleukin (IL) - 1 α, IL- 1 β, IL- 2, IL- 4, and IL- 6, all of which are known to be associated with DED. Lifitegrast {{has the potential to be}} the first pharmaceutical product approved in the US indicated for the treatment of both symptoms and signs of DED. Clinical trials involving over 2, 500 adult DED patients have demonstrated that topically administered lifitegrast 5. 0 % ophthalmic solution can rapidly reduce the symptoms of <b>eye</b> <b>dryness</b> and decrease ocular surface staining with an acceptable long-term safety profile.

50|$|As the {{approach}} to adulthood becomes apparent in a young Malay girl’s life, she receives a wealth of herbal health knowledge from facial and skin care to herbal remedies. The Malays believe the face {{is a reflection of}} the whole body. A fresh facial complexion of radiance is believed to be an indication of a well-balanced mind, body and spirit. Dark circles under the <b>eyes,</b> puffiness, blemishes, <b>dryness</b> and wrinkles reflect an imbalance within the wider body system. Malays hold the belief that internal cleanliness has direct outer consequences, therefore, a once-a-week herbal brew of leaves and herbs such as senna leaves (Cassia angustifolia), betel leaves (Piper betle), ginger (Zingiber officinale), sepang (Caesalpinia sappan) and other ingredients are often used for internal cleansing, seeking results of detoxifying the body of waste, removing fat and purifying the blood, resulting in a beautiful, youthful complexion.|$|R

We consecutively studied seven eyes in seven cases (three males and four females) with mild lagophthalmos (three cases after eyelid surgery, two cases of incomplete facial nerve palsy, and two cases of senile ectropion) during {{the treatment of}} corneal disorders with rebamipide eye drops four times daily for 2 weeks. The fluorescein corneal staining (FCS) score, tear film break-up time (TBUT), Schirmer&# 39;s test, and decimal visual acuity were examined. Ocular symptoms were examined and scored by questioning each patient before and after administration of the drug. In all seven eyes, inferior corneal erosion decreased or disappeared within 2 weeks after administration of topical rebamipide. The FCS score was significantly improved (P < 0. 05). The TBUT was significantly extended from 2. 9 ± 0. 5 seconds to 5. 2 ± 0. 4 seconds (P < 0. 05). The scores of ocular symptoms, such as <b>eye</b> pain, <b>dryness,</b> blurred vision, and foreign body sensations, were significantly improved (P < 0. 05). Topical rebamipide was effective for corneal disorders in mild lagophthalmos. This drug may provide a novel approach to treat lagophthalmos.

40|$|Dr. Janae K. Heath (Medicine) : A 32 -year-old man was {{admitted}} to this hospital because of loss of vision. The patient was in his usual health until 3 weeks before admission, when pain-less conjunctival injection developed in the left <b>eye,</b> associated with <b>dryness.</b> He self-administered ophthalmic tetrahydrozoline solution, and the condition re-solved. Approximately 1 week before admission, the symptoms recurred and pro-gressively worsened. Discharge with crusting was present in both eyes in the mornings. Three days before admission, he noted loss of vision on awakening, with light perception in the left eye and blurred vision in the right eye; vision in the right eye reportedly improved slightly after the administration of ophthalmic tetrahydrozoline solution. Discharge from the eyes and crusting on the eyelashes persisted. On the morning of admission, a relative visited the patient at his home {{and took him to}} the emergency department at another hospital. On examination, the vital signs were normal. Ophthalmic abnormalities were reportedly noted. Laboratory results are shown in Table 1. A metal eye protector was placed over th...|$|R
