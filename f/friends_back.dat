500|$|The {{contribution}} to the war made by Southern Rhodesia's white female population generally comprised organising and running donation drives, comforts committees and other similar enterprises. They sent the troops [...] "comforts parcels", which contained balaclavas, mittens and scarves that they had knitted, as well as newspapers, soap, food (including cakes and sweets), and minor luxuries. These packages did much to raise {{the morale of the}} men, particularly those who were in German captivity. Women were also largely responsible for handling mail between Rhodesian soldiers and their relatives and <b>friends</b> <b>back</b> home. After the armistice, they organised financial assistance for those discharged Southern Rhodesian men in England who could not afford to come home, and arranged visits for those convalescing in English hospitals.|$|E

500|$|On {{arrival in}} London, Hammill and Smith {{met up with}} trainee BBC {{engineer}} and classically trained organist Hugh Banton, who was a brother {{of one of their}} <b>friends</b> <b>back</b> in Manchester. Later that year, they met Tony Stratton-Smith, who agreed to sign a management contract with them in December. Through him, the band acquired a bass guitar player, Keith Ellis, with drummer Guy Evans joining not too long afterwards. This line-up performed on BBC Radio 1's Top Gear radio show in November, and recorded a series of demos for Mercury, before releasing a single ("People You Were Going To" [...] b/w [...] "Firebrand") on Polydor Records in January 1969. Melody Maker said the single was [...] "one of the best records of the week". But the single was quickly withdrawn under pressure from Mercury, since it violated the contract band members Hammill and Smith signed the previous year. Smith, feeling superfluous to requirements, left the band, amicably, shortly after the recording of the single. He later released demos featuring his time in Van der Graaf Generator on a CD, Democrazy.|$|E
500|$|Priestley {{seems to}} have yearned for a more {{cosmopolitan}} community than Northumberland provided, writing to his sister that it was [...] "seemingly almost out of the world" [...] and complaining {{that he had to}} wait a week for news. He wrote to his friend John Vaughan: [...] "We know but little more than we did when we left you of European affairs." [...] In the winter of 1794–95, Priestley wrote to friends that his situation was very [...] "distant from my original views" [...] and [...] "my time here is far from passing so agreeably as it did in England", yet he was [...] "very thankful for such an asylum" [...] and he attempted [...] "to make the best of my situation". In his letters to <b>friends</b> <b>back</b> in Britain, Priestley consistently referred to himself as an exile and to England as his real home. Mary was happier with the couple's situation and wrote to William Vaughan: [...] "I am happy and thankful to meet with so sweet a situation and so peaceful a retreat as the place I now write from. Dr. Priestley also likes it and of his own choice intends to settle here, which is more than I hoped for at the time we came up...This country is very delightful, the prospects of wood and water more beautiful than I have ever seen before and the people plain and decent in their manners." ...|$|E

2500|$|Anna Maria King, {{like many}} other women, also advised family and <b>friends</b> <b>back</b> home of {{the realities of the}} trip and offered advice on how to prepare for the trip. Women also reacted and responded, often enthusiastically, to the {{landscape}} of the West. Betsey Bayley in a letter to her sister, Lucy P. Griffith described how travelers responded to the new environment they encountered:“The mountains looked like volcanoes and the appearance that one day there had been an awful thundering of volcanoes and a burning world. The valleys were all covered with a white crust and looked like salaratus. Some of the company used it to raise their bread.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2008 Crow (in {{partnership}} with Western Glove Works) launched a jeans brand, Bootheel Trading Company.

He appeared on the American talk show The Oprah Winfrey Show on October 24, 2007, and on BBC Three's Undercover Princes. In 2008, Zoltan Parag, a competitor at the Mr. Gay International contest {{said that he was}} apprehensive about returning to India.

2500|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Utah Territory was heavily {{populated}} by Mormons and dominated religiously and politically by the Mormon Church, which held great sway over Mormons voters. Because {{the vast majority}} of the population was Mormon, people outside of the LDS church had very little political representation. The segregation between Mormons and non-Mormons (at the time called [...] "Gentiles") became very apparent. As a non-Mormon woman there were few ways to meet other women, whereas, the women of the Mormon Church had the Relief Society to build friendships and expend energy. Froiseth struggled with the lack of social engagement. During a visit to family and <b>friends</b> <b>back</b> in New York City in 1875, Froiseth attended the Sorosis Women's club with her sister Julia. The experience Froiseth had at the club motivated her to form a literary club back in Salt Lake City which was organized in 1875 and called the Blue Tea. It was Utah's first women's club. The Blue Tea's first president was Froiseth (1876) who set a cap of 25 members. The Blue Tea discussed many topics for the purpose of stimulating [...] "mental culture" [...] within its members. A few women would be assigned to read a book or article and come back the next week to expound on the ideas they read. Then the club would debate over those ideas. Froiseth described the Blue Tea's first year: [...] "we did good work, had some fine programmes, necessitating not a little reading and study, and the meetings went so well that there was rarely a vacant chair". Froiseth's club gave non-Mormon women the chance to socialize but also empowered them to push for change within their society. The minutes for the Blue Tea can be found in the Special Collections of the Marriott Library, ...|$|E
