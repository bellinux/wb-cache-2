25|$|Heinz Heydrich {{had five}} children. His oldest, Peter Thomas Heydrich (1931–2000), was a {{well-known}} German cabaret singer, {{and wrote a}} book about his childhood, father, and uncle. In the book, Peter Heydrich describes how, as a youth, he enjoyed the fame of being a “crown prince,” the nephew of Reinhard Heydrich. During boyhood, he thought of his uncle as a successful sportsman and a sensitive musician. In Prague, Peter observed that his uncle had become a “high animal.” Peter derived many privileges from being Reinhard Heydrich’s nephew. Even after the war, Peter still felt some pride in the familial relationship, if not so openly. But finally, Peter Heydrich <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> Reinhard Heydrich was a protean schemer, who planned and executed the Holocaust and other crimes. Peter died on 22 November 2000, after a long illness.|$|E
25|$|Initially it {{was thought}} by Siemens and VAG that development, testing and {{certification}} of the ATC components could be conducted during those 3 years in parallel {{to the construction of}} the line, at first in simulations and, after the first DT3 units had been delivered, on a test track at the Langwasser Depot, and that the new line could enter service immediately after the tunnels and stations were built. However, in 2005 news was published that ATC development was not progressing as planned and that the opening would have to be postponed by one year to late 2006 or early 2007. In fall 2006 the responsible parties <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> the ATC system would still not be ready by the already postponed date at the end of 2006 and that the opening of the line would have to be postponed again. At that point, Siemens appointed a new project manager. The new U3 line finally opened on June 14, 2008.|$|E

25|$|The {{process of}} {{preserving}} the sites of the Pajarito Plateau proved difficult and time-consuming, partly because interactions among the affected parties were complex, and partly because when Roosevelt passed the reins of government to William Howard Taft, enthusiasm in the White House for preserving such sites was diminished. Another factor {{had to do with}} Hewett's own personality. He had many supporters, but also many critics, and some of the latter complained that his real goal was to ensure that he, Edgar L. Hewett, D.Sc., Director of the School of American Research, would have access to, and control of, the Plateau's sites—while his rivals would not. Negotiations over a new monument were long and contentious, but finally, on February 11, 1916, President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed the new Bandelier National Monument, naming it for Adolph Bandelier who had died recently. The monument was rather smaller than Hewett had hoped, covering only Frijoles Canyon, some comparatively empty land to the southwest, and an outlier (now Tsankawi), and omitting among others the very significant Puye Cliff Dwellings near Santa Clara Pueblo. However, even the most ardent preservationists <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that,</b> from the standpoint of protecting Puebloan sites, Bandelier was much better than nothing.|$|E

It went through four editions in his lifetime, and more after his death, and generations of readers have found it an amusing and engaging read, projecting an author always [...] "happy in his own good opinion, {{the best of all}} others; teeming with animal spirits, and uniting the self-sufficiency of youth with the garrulity of age." ...|$|E

2500|$|This {{period was}} later {{referred}} to as the [...] "Sack of Palermo" [...] because the construction boom led to the destruction of the city's green belt, and villas that gave it architectural grace, to make way for characterless and shoddily constructed apartment blocks.

In 1964, during an investigation, Lima <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> he knew Angelo La Barbera, one of Palermo's most powerful mobsters.

Since the speech had been recorded, he then <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> he had used the word [...] "criminals".

In January 1931, Stanley managed to do just that, using a voltage of 1 kV to accelerate hydrogen ions to 80 keV. At Lawrence's prompting, Stanley quickly wrote up his thesis and submitted it in April 1931 {{so that he would}} be eligible for an instructorship the following year. [...] His oral exam proved more difficult. Raymond Birge started asking questions about nuclear physics, and Livingston <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> he knew nothing about the work of Ernest Rutherford, James Chadwick, and Charles Drummond Ellis, and had not read their 1930 monograph [...] Radiations from Radioactive Substances.

2500|$|On January 19, the Iowa Republican Party {{released}} the certified results showing Santorum edged out Romney with 29,839 votes to Romney's 29,805, {{a margin of}} 34 votes.

[...] One party executive called the result a [...] "split decision."

2500|$|One {{specific}} {{scene in}} the film perceived {{as an example of}} anti-Semitism was in the dialogue of Caiaphas, when he states [...] "His blood [...] on us and on our children!", a quote historically interpreted by some as a curse taken upon by the Jewish people. Certain Jewish groups asked this be removed from the film. However, only the subtitles were removed; the original dialogue remains in the Hebrew soundtrack. When asked about this scene, Gibson said: [...] "I wanted it in. My brother said I was wimping out if I didn't include it. But, man, if I included that in there, they'd be coming after me at my house. They'd come to kill me." [...] In another interview when asked about the scene, he said, [...] "It's one little passage, and I believe it, but I don't and never have believed it refers to Jews, and implicates them in any sort of curse. It's directed at all of us, all men who were there, and all that came after. His blood is on us, and that's what Jesus wanted. But I finally <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> one of the reasons I felt strongly about keeping it, aside from the fact it's true, is that I didn't want to let someone else dictate what could or couldn't be said." ...|$|E
