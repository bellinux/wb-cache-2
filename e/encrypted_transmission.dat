Indeed, the particular time evolution nature of chaotic signals constitutes the fundamentals of their application to secure telecommunications. The pseudo random signal constitutes the carrier wave for the communication. The information coded on the carrier wave can be extracted with knowledge of the system dynamic evolution law. This evolution law consists of a second-order delay differential equation in which intervene the various parameters of the physical system setup. The set of precise parameter values forms the key, in a cryptographic sense, of the <b>encrypted</b> <b>transmission.</b> This thesis work presents the implementation of an experimental encryption system using chaos. The optical intensity of the emitter fluctuates chaotically and serves as carrier wave. A message of small amplitude, hidden inside the fluctuations of the carrier wave, is extracted from the transmitted signal by a properly tuned receiver. The influence of the message modulation format on the communication quality both in the back to back case and after propagation is investigated numerically. Ph. D.

30|$|As a result, it {{is shown}} in Additional file  4 : Figure S 4 a that the {{proposed}} C-NOMA has a large coding gain for the unencrypted BPSK-NOMA transmission. This {{is because of the}} channel coding effect generated by the C-MIMO. Compared to the BPSK-NOMA method, its gain is about 5  dB at an average BER of 10 − 5. (Comment 2 – 4) When comparing the performance with the upper and lower limits, {{it was found that the}} numerical results were within both bounds and the lower limit of C-NOMA is nearly free of any observable error. Note that the upper and lower limits of BPSK-NOMA overlap each other due to the mismatch setting of the power offset αFTPC for the concentric user distribution. Also, the BER of a third party without the valid keys (initial values) attempting to demodulate the transmitted signals, is plotted as “C-NOMA, unsync.” It was observed that the BER becomes 0.5 regardless of the average SNR received, and thus the correct information is inaccessible. Therefore, the physical layer security effect is proven with the C-NOMA scheme against a third party without the correct keys. Similarly, in Additional file  4 : Figure S 4 b, the performance of the C-NOMA setup is superior to the unencrypted BPSK-NOMA, reaching the maximum throughput when the average SNR is about 15  dB. (Comment 2 – 4) This advantage of C-NOMA is also confirmed in comparing the upper and lower limits in the figure. Moreover, in comparison with the C-OFDMA method, which is the same <b>encrypted</b> <b>transmission</b> scheme as the proposed C-NOMA technique—although the BER is inferior because the allocated power per user decreases in the case of C-NOMA—the number of accommodated users increases because of the NOMA architecture, and accordingly, the system capacity can be increased while maintaining the physical layer security.|$|E
40|$|AIMS: Find a {{videoconferencing}} {{platform to}} implement a simulated learning environment (SLE) for supplementing clinical placements for physiotherapy students. BACKGROUND: Telerehabilitation is increasingly common in service provision and more recently in supervision of students and simulation. In the STEPS project, physiotherapy students remain in their clinical placements at remote locations and access an on-campus simulated learning environment, via a teleconferencing platform, for approximately 20 % of their 5 -week clinical placement. Students assess and manage standardised, simulated patients using scenarios based on what would occur in a telerehabilitation environment. The daily structure involves eight students transitioning between live interaction with each of two standardised patients, pre-recorded videos of {{some aspects of the}} assessment, peer review with other students, and discussion with each of two clinical facilitators. Finding a videoconferencing platform that is compatible with the sometimes conflicting needs of the university, health care facilities (such as public hospitals, private practices) and the STEPS project has proven {{to be one of the}} most challenging aspects the project. Universities and health care facilities require their systems to be secure and need to control the amount of data flow. Telerehabilitation requires secure <b>encrypted</b> <b>transmission</b> of information and can require a significant bandwidth. The STEPS project requires reasonable security and bandwidth, but also flexibility for multiple and rapid changes in connections between different combinations of up to ten people (and locations). METHODS/RESULTS: A dedicated stand-alone telemedicine system was secure but lacked flexibility for multiple connections and presented difficulties penetrating university or hospital firewalls. Publicly available videoconferencing systems were also blocked by some institutional firewalls and required a bandwidth that was not possible at remote locations using the alternative of wireless broadband. Videoconferencing facilities located in the hospitals were often not available for the eight hours per week needed for the project. Even when available, such systems struggle with multiple changes in connectivity, require higher level technical support on an ongoing basis, and could be inconsistent in their performance. CONCLUSIONS: Even though the technology for telerehabilitation is improving rapidly, finding and implementing a system for a specialised application may not be a trivial task.

Network security has received increased attention in the last decades. Encryption has laid itself as the traditional method to transmit information in secrecy. Although strong encryption is a very secure approach for transmitting information, it can be easily identified that transmitted information is encrypted. Once the information is identified as encrypted, an intruder can block the <b>encrypted</b> <b>transmission.</b> In contrast, Steganography is a viable option to hide information in transmission without being identified. It provides a blanket that hides encrypted information. Thus, it becomes essential to develop mechanisms that reveal if the communicated information has any embedded data. Steganalysis is the art of detecting invisible communication and is a very challenging field due to different types of media and embedding techniques involved. Existing research in Steganalysis has focused on developing individual stego detection algorithms for a particular media type or for a particular embedding technique. In this dissertation we are proposing to develop a unified Steganalyzer that can not only work with different media types such as images and audio, but further is capable of providing improved accuracy in stego detection through the use of multiple algorithms. Our proposed system integrates different steganalysis techniques in a reliable Steganalyzer by using a Services Oriented Architecture (SOA). The SOA architecture not only allows for concurrent processing to speed up the system, but also provides higher reliability than those reported in the existing literature because multiple stego detection algorithms are incorporated simultaneously. Furthermore, the extendable nature of the SOA implementation allows for easy addition of new Steganalysis algorithms to the system in terms of services. The universal steganalysis technique proposed in this dissertation involves two processes; feature extraction and feature classification. An improved 2 D Mel-Cepstrum implementation is used for wav files feature extraction. Intra-blocks technique is used for jpeg images feature extraction. The feature classification process is implemented using three different classifiers; neural network classifier, Support Vector Machines classifier, and AdaBoost classifier. The unified steganalyzer is tested for jpeg images and wav audio files. The accuracy of classification ranges from 90. 0 % to 99. 9 % depending on the object type and the feature extraction method. In particular, an enhancement of 2 D Mel-Cepstrum implementation is introduced that achieves an accuracy of 99. 9 %. This is significantly better result than the average detection accuracy of 89. 9 % to 96. 7 % reported by Liu [1]. Finally, an extensible classifier is introduced that allows adding detection of new embedding techniques to the currently supported embedding techniques, so that the framework will maintain its reliability even if new embedding techniques are introduced...|$|E

50|$|One design {{choice was}} to use lower levels of error {{correction}} for portions of the encoded voice data that is deemed less critical for intelligibility.

The varying levels of error correction are implemented by breaking P25 message frames into subframes. This allows an attacker to jam entire messages by transmitting only during certain short subframes that are critical to reception of the entire frame. As a result, an attacker can effectively jam Project 25 signals with average power levels much lower that the power levels used for communication. Such attacks can be targeted at <b>encrypted</b> <b>transmissions</b> only, forcing users to transmit in the clear.|$|R
