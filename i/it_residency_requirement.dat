40|$|This article argues against {{laws which}} mandate that {{candidates}} {{and elected officials}} reside in a particular geographic area {{as a condition of}} election or office-holding (i. e., <b>residency</b> <b>requirements).</b> The article considers various rationales for <b>residency</b> <b>requirements</b> — some of which have been endorsed by federal and state courts — and concludes that those rationales by-and-large do not hold up under scrutiny. The article also considers the costs of <b>residency</b> <b>requirements</b> and concludes that the costs of such requirements outweigh any purported benefits. The article then ponders why <b>residency</b> <b>requirements</b> have continued to exist despite weak justifications for their use, and concludes that <b>residency</b> <b>requirements</b> likely persist because they insulate incumbent partisans from electoral competition. As such, a politics as markets approach might suggest the elimination of <b>residency</b> <b>requirements...</b>|$|R
5000|$|It is {{the third}} federal circuit court {{decision}} in 2008 that invalidates a state <b>residency</b> <b>requirement.</b> The Sixth Circuit said that Michigan's <b>residency</b> <b>requirement</b> is unconstitutional in Bogaert v. Land in August 2008 and the Ninth Circuit said that Arizona's <b>residency</b> <b>requirement</b> is unconstitutional in Nader v. Brewer in July 2008.|$|R
50|$|Although the <b>residency</b> <b>requirement</b> {{at issue}} related to {{collecting}} signatures for independent presidential candidates, in its decision, the court discussed <b>residency</b> <b>requirements</b> for initiative circulators and candidate circulators {{as if the}} issues in both were identical.|$|R
50|$|McKay {{served on}} a three judge panel {{in the case of}} Yes on Term Limits v Savage which was a federal lawsuit {{challenging}} Oklahoma's <b>residency</b> <b>requirements</b> for petition circulators. On December 18, 2008, McKay and his fellow judges issued a unanimous decision in the case, saying that Oklahoma's residency restriction is an unconstitutional violation of First Amendment speech rights. The decision of the Tenth Circuit overturned a lower federal court decision. This decision was significant because it was third federal circuit court decision that invalidated a state <b>residency</b> <b>requirement</b> in 2008, preceded by the Sixth Circuit ruling that Michigan's <b>residency</b> <b>requirement</b> is unconstitutional in Bogaert v. Land in August, and the Ninth Circuit ruling that Arizona's <b>residency</b> <b>requirement</b> is unconstitutional in Nader v. Brewer in July.|$|R
50|$|Many {{persons in}} the United States on J-1 visa {{are subject to the}} two-year home <b>residency</b> <b>requirement</b> found in Section 212(e) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Under the Section 212(e), before a person on a J-1 visa with the two-year home <b>residency</b> <b>requirement</b> can change to nonimmigrant status (H-1B or L1, for example), or adjust to U.S. {{permanent}} resident status, the J-1 person must either return to the country of last residence for two years or obtain a waiver of the two-year home <b>residency</b> <b>requirement.</b>|$|R
