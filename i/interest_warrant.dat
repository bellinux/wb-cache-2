40|$|International Humanitarian Laws of Armed Conflict {{effectively}} {{prohibit the}} use of terror-violence as a means or method of warfare in all circumstances of armed conflict. However, as new "terrorist" enemies {{do not appear to}} share this humanitarian consensus, it becomes crucial to contextualise accurately any characterisation of the recent "war" on "global terror" as a "war"' to which International Humanitarian Law can attach. What needs to be remembered, first, is that technological innovation can destabilise accepted frameworks for waging war. Thus, any laws intended to curtail {{the use of}} particular means and methods of warfare will reflect the contemporaneous environment within which such laws were formulated. Secondly, modern laws of war evolved from nineteenth century reciprocal pacts designed to ensure minimal levels of restraint between "civilised" peoples. While any strict contractual approach to mutuality-in-restraint has been superceded in the post- 1945 era by more universalised obligations, the interests reflected in this original mutuality of <b>interest</b> <b>warrant</b> examination when distinguishing today between "justifiable"' and "unjustifiable", or "licit"' and "illicit", uses of violence...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{uses the}} {{foundation}} of the conceptual framework proposed by Ager and Strang (2004 a, 2008) to reflect on the focus and findings of papers in this special issue on refugee integration and other recent work. Arguing that 'mid-level theory' of the sort presented in the framework provides a strong basis for structuring academic debate and dialogue with practitioners and policymakers, we identify four key issues that although of some current <b>interest</b> <b>warrant</b> further attention. First, we consider recent evidence from Europe and elsewhere on how prevailing notions of nationhood and citizenship determine understandings of integration, and argue that this powerfully shapes the social space available to refugees with regard to 'belonging'. Second, we note the wide adoption of concepts of social capital in framing components of social connection in the context of integration, but suggest greater attention is paid to the manner in which bonds, bridges and links establish forms of reciprocity and trust in social relations. Third, we examine the notion that integration is a 'two way' process, and suggest how this might be expanded to embrace the multiplicity and fluidity of social meaning and identity. Fourth, we reflect on Hobfoll's (1998) work on 'resource acquisition spirals' as a basis for effectively conceptualizing the dynamic interplay between factors mapped by the framework in shaping trajectories of integration. © The Author 2010.

40|$|Abstract Background Complexity {{and noise}} in {{expression}} quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies {{make it difficult}} to distinguish potential regulatory relationships among the many interactions. The predominant method of identifying eQTLs finds associations that are significant at a genome-wide level. The vast number of statistical tests carried out on these data make false negatives very likely. Corrections for multiple testing error render genome-wide eQTL techniques unable to detect modest regulatory effects. We propose an alternative method to identify eQTLs that builds on traditional approaches. In contrast to genome-wide techniques, our method determines the significance of an association between an expression trait and a locus with respect to the set of all associations to the expression trait. The use of this specific information facilitates identification of expression traits that have an expression profile that is characterized by a single exceptional association to a locus. Our approach identifies expression traits that have exceptional associations regardless of the genome-wide significance of those associations. This property facilitates the identification of possible false negatives for genome-wide significance. Further, our approach has the property of prioritizing expression traits that are affected by few strong associations. Expression traits identified by this method may warrant additional study because their expression level may be affected by targeting genes near a single locus. Results We demonstrate our method by identifying eQTL hotspots in Plasmodium falciparum (malaria) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast). We demonstrate the prioritization of traits with few strong genetic effects through Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of Yeast. Our results are strongly consistent with results gathered using genome-wide methods and identify additional hotspots and eQTLs. Conclusions New eQTLs and hotspots found with this method may represent regions of the genome or biological processes that are controlled through few relatively strong genetic interactions. These points of <b>interest</b> <b>warrant</b> experimental investigation. </p...|$|E
