40|$|Malaysia is {{a rapidly}} {{developing}} {{country that is}} working hard towards achieving its Vision 2020, of becoming a developed country. The increase in economic activities has also resulted {{to an increase in}} the country air pollution problem. One of the main sources of the pollutants is emissions from motor vehicles, which is originated from incomplete fuel combustion; either diesel or gasoline. Among the emissions that are considered to be harmful to human health and environment are carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC), nitrogen oxide (NOX), sulphur oxide (SOX) and carbon soot. Most emissions are equally contributed both gasoline and diesel <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicles.</b> However, heavy duty diesel <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicles</b> are the main contributor for the soot and NOX emissions. At present, in Malaysia, there is no regulation that forces diesel <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicles</b> to be installed with exhaust after treatment system, which is able to reduce soot emission. In this paper, an overview on the control of emissions from diesel <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicles</b> in Malaysia will be presented. In addition to that, description of a novel exhaust after treatment system, based on porous medium, which aims to suppress soot emission from diesel <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicles,</b> is also be included...|$|R

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that the transportation {{system is a}} major contributor of greenhouse gas emissions, leading to an unsustainable future. While the problem is more intense in the developed countries, in which the transportation sector is responsible for approximately twenty five to {{forty percent of the}} overall greenhouse emissions, the developing world is following suit. Recent trends indicate an increasing demand for automobiles, in these countries, with potentially dire environmental consequences for the planet. Meeting the growing demand for personal mobility and transport of goods in a sustainable way represents a wide range of interrelated technological and public policy challenges. A number of strategies for fulfilling sustainability targets impose improvements in vehicle technology and fuels. Alternative <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicles</b> offer hope for drastic reductions in air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. One the most important challenges regarding alternative <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicles</b> is devising strategies that will lead to the success of these vehicles in the market. In this respect, an important dimension is to understand household preferences regarding certain vehicle characteristics, fuel availability and policies affecting a vehicle’s end price. Since alternative <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicles</b> are not widely available, researchers resort to innovative approaches for assessing their demand. One such method is known as stated choices. The method uses experimental design to create sets of hypothetical vehicle options using a number of vehicle attributes. This paper describes a framework for assessing the demand for alternative <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicles</b> and its application to the Census Metropolitan Area of Hamilton, Canada. Data collection is conducted using contemporary internet-based surveying techniques and respondents are recruited via e-mail. The overall procedure involves two stages. First, respondents are asked to provide information about their household, residence and vehicles currently owned. A second stage in the survey employs the stated choices experiment where respondents choose the vehicle they would most likely buy from a hypothetical set of vehicles that use gasoline, a mix of fuels (hybrid) or an alternative fuel. Results from this study will contribute to scenario building with the purpose of examining the implications of policies, regarding the potential contribution of alternative <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicles</b> to emission reduction objectives and the sustainability of the transportation system...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{negative}} {{environmental impacts}} from urban freight transport and deliveries {{to a large}} extent are derived from the fact that conventionally <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicles</b> are mainly used for transporting goods. Many countries, including all those in the EU, have implemented regulations aimed at setting high technical parameters for conventionally <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicles</b> in order to reduce their negative impacts, however, in the long term it seems to be insufficient. This, combined with the issue of oil resources depletion, leads to the need to search for alternative forms of delivery transport. One such solution is electric vehicles. These {{are becoming more and more}} popular, nevertheless, but they are mainly used in passenger transport. This article analyses a selected range of electrically powered freight vehicles and points out possibilities of applying such vehicles to make deliveries in cities...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the factors and incentives {{that are most}} likely to influence households’ choice for cleanervehicles in the metropolitan area of Hamilton, Canada. Data collection is based on experimental design and stated choice methods through an Internet survey. Choice alternatives included a conventional gasoline, a hybrid and an alternative <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Each option is described by a varying set of vehicle attributes and economic incentives, customized per respondent. Controlling for individual, household and dwelling-location characteristics, parameters of a nested logit model indicates that reduced monetary costs, purchase tax relieves and low emissions rates would encourage households to adopt a cleanervehicle. On the other hand, incentives such as free parking and permission to drive on high occupancy vehicle lanes with one person in the car were not significant. Furthermore, limited fuel availability is a concern when households considered the adoption of an alternative <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Finally, willingness-to-pay extra for a cleanervehicle is computed based on the estimated parameters...|$|R

40|$|The fine {{particle}} size distribution characteristics obtained from a diesel taxi, a diesel light bus, a gasoline private car and a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) fuelled taxi were carried out on a chassis dynamometer system. The measurements were performed at different driving modes, i. e., with low and high idling and from 10 km· h - 1 to 70 km· h - 1, 4 cruise operations using the instrument SMPS for collecting particles of 0. 015 ∼ 0. 7 μm diameter in range. It was found that different <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicles</b> and different driving modes characterize considerable differences in size number and mass concentration distributions. Diesel vehicles contribute much more nuclei and accumulation mode particles of 30 ∼ 150 nm, while LPG and gasoline <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicles</b> exhaust much more nuclei mode particles of 15 ∼ 30 nm. Overall, diesel-fuelled vehicles exhaust much more particles number and mass than gasoline and LPG fuelled vehicles; In the present study, diesel vehicles exhaust the ranges of total SMPS particle number, mass concentration with (0. 3 ∼ 3. 6) × 10 8 number ·cm - 3, 0. 03 ∼ 0. 6 μ·cm - 3 respectively, and gasoline and LPG <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicles</b> exhaust 2. 3 × 10 4 ∼ 1. 2 × 10 7 number·cm - 3, 8 × 10 - 5 ∼ 0. 1 μg·cm - 3; 8. 2 × 10 3 ∼ 8. 8 × 10 6 number·cm - 3, 1. 7 × 10 - 5 ∼ 0. 09 μg·cm - 3, respectively; For all types of vehicles, the particle number and mass concentrations are small at low-idle and low-speed-driving modes, and are large at high-idle and high-speed-driving modes.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we present the first {{estimates}} and inventory of {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon}} (PAH) emissions from mobile sources in megacity Delhi, India for the period 1999 – 2006. The “COPERT 4 ” model was used to estimate 23 –species of PAHs and 5 –congeners of polychlorinated dibenzo–p–dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzo–furans (PCDFs) from the gasoline, diesel, and CNG (compressed natural gas) <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Our study shows that the total annual emissions of ∑ 23 –PAHs from road transport has increased ~ 4 times and emissions of Napthalene (Nap) emerged as the most prominent (8 times), whereas a two-fold increase was seen for the carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and benzo[a]pyrene equivalence (BaPeq) emissions between 1999 and 2006 from the road transport alone. Further increase in total PCDDs and PCDFs by ~ 3 times can made air quality even worse. Estimated emission share of low molecular weight PAHs (2 –ring) has increased (from 43 %– 85 %), whereas vice-versa for ones with high molecular weights. Switch–over to CNG especially for public transport resulted into an offset of 21 % emissions of ∑ 23 –PAHs, 14 % in BaP, and 15 % in BaPeq for the year 2006. It is also observed that the PAH emissions from CNG <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicles</b> have decreased, but overall increase in the share of private vehicles (1. 5 times) has outweighed this benefit...|$|R
30|$|In this {{scenario}} both {{the cost of}} scheduling and emissions are increased by 1.61 % and 1.35 % respectively {{when compared to the}} base case or the traditional case.

However, the conversion of conventional fossil <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicle</b> to green means of transportation, there is a yearly savings of 326678.766 tons [27].|$|R

The objective of the present study is to examine the adaptation of natural gas as vehicle fuel and carry out a technical analysis and an economical feasibility analysis of the two types of ICE vehicles, namely gasoline and natural gas <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The technical model uses the physical properties of the two fuels and the performance factors of internal combustion engines including brake thermal efficiency. The resulting exhaust gas emissions are also estimated by the technical model using combustion calculations which provide the expected levels of exhaust gas emissions.

Furthermore, the estimated performance characteristics of the two types of engines, along with local statistical data on annual fuel imports and annual fuel consumption for transportation and data on the vehicles fleet for the case study of Cyprus are used as input in the economical model. For the base year 2013, data of natural gas price is also used in the economical model.

40|$|AbstractResultsobtained through {{combining}} different approaches, and {{aiming at}} {{contributing to the}} understanding of effects of bioethanol <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicles</b> on urban air quality, are evaluated. The study is based on the results obtained by measurements, modelling and cost assessment estimates in a case study in Oslo under winter conditions, when the worst air quality episodes are registered and acetaldehyde and formaldehyde have the longest lifetime. Detailed levels of formaldehyde emitted by an E 95 -bus under on-road driving conditions are reported for the first time, and indicate that exposure to these levels may involve a high chance of developing cancer. Emission and air dispersion modelling were applied to evaluate the potential impact on urban environment. The results show that a full implementation of bioethanol (E 85 -vehicles) may affect urban air quality, subsequently affecting human health. Acetaldehyde emissions were estimated to increase by 233 % for a full implementation of bioethanol (E 85 -vehicles) compared to the baseline (petrol/diesel vehicles), whereas CO 2, NOx and exhaust particle emissions from traffic were estimated to decrease by 19 %, 50 % and 90 %, respectively. Output from measurements and the air dispersion model were the basis for an impact assessment and economic valuation of implementing bioethanol fuel in a larger scale. The acetaldehyde-related health risk associated with emissions from bioethanol <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicles</b> was estimated as oral cavity/pharynx cancer, and the related cost was found to increase by 300 % for a full implementation of bioethanol relative to the current situation.

40|$|The {{increasing}} concerns on fuel prices, lowest fuel consumption, higher {{operating efficiency}} and {{low levels of}} carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbon during cold start have generated noticeable interest on diesel engine as a prime mover with expected higher soot and NOX emissions. In order to reduce the emission from diesel <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicle,</b> some control technologies were introduced. One of the technology is diesel particulate filter (DPF) which consists of a porous substrate that permits exhaust to pass through but traps particulate matter (PM) or carboneous soot. Conventional DPFs are manufactured using expensive materials. In this study, alternative material based on alumina and zeolite was used to form porous ceramics filter installed in diesel <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicle</b> exhaust system and named as novel diesel particulate filter (NDPF). The NDPF elements were arranged in line with 1 cm spacing inside an enclosed casing. The NDPF showed potential as DPF to curb soot emissions. Pressure drop for the NDPF was in the range of 89 % - 93 % at every given flow rate during pressure drop test. Effective soot reduction was in the range of 60 % - 70 %. As predicted, trapped soot were accumulated mostly at the front and middle of NDPF. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive xray (EDX) analysis confirmed the trapping ability of carbon elements in the range of 19 % - 70 % for each filter. Brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) was slightly affected when NDPF was installed in the exhaust system and resulted to drops in engine efficiency in the range of 2 % - 26 %. Nevertheless, further reinforcement steps for the NDPF are needed to prolong its filtering capacity...|$|R
30|$|To {{widen the}} {{acceptance}} of AFVs, these studies suggest that policymakers should act on the environmental concerns by issuing educational campaigns to raise awareness about the features and benefits of AFVs [31, 32, 65]. In this respect, consumers seem to react more to emission information (eco-labelling) at the vehicle level than at the class level [60]. In addition, tax incentives (e.g., surcharge of dirtier fuels, differentiation of vehicle taxes based on fuel economy or CO 2 emissions), subsidies or private privileges (e.g., free parking) should make these vehicles more financially competitive as compared to conventionally <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicles</b> [32, 65].

30|$|According to the {{symbolic}} studies, the market success of AFVs {{will depend on}} the existing and new symbolic meanings that are attached to these vehicles. In case of EVs, PHEVs and HFCVs, the challenge is thus to exploit new symbolic meanings that were not previously available in other vehicle types. However, if one wants to offer potential buyers stronger, more authentic access to these symbolic meanings such as “environmental preservation”, “oil independence” or “financial acumen”, a broad consensus about their environmentally friendly aspects or financial attractiveness should exist. Any confusion about these aspects (e.g., about the sustainability of the fuel on a well-to-wheel basis) could strip these potential symbolic meanings from AFVs. In this respect, common information tools that provide factual information on the potential environmental and financial benefits of AFVs are required in order to distinguish them from conventionally <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicles.</b>|$|R

Attitudinal studies are rather performed to uncover the consumer attitudes for biofuels and hydrogen whereas consumer preference studies often deal {{with a variety of}} technologies. A potential gap in most of the reviewed studies is that they focus solely on the preferences for one technology [75].

To determine the proper amount of gas to be injected, a controller has been designed based on nonlinear inverse dynamics of AFR. The results show that the predicted results are in line with the measured fuel injection commands produced by the real electronic control unit (ECU). This evaluated and validated the efficiency of the controller.

30|$|Short-term {{exposure}} {{improves the}} respondents’ overall impressions of AFVs, especially {{with respect to}} their environmental benefits [39, 61]. But, as they gain experience with AFVs, those perceived environmental benefits become a lower priority as other vehicle features will enter the decision set [39]. On the one hand, comparisons will be made based on range, purchase price and convenience of use [38]. Some of the reviewed studies reveal that respondents did not change their perception about the desired range [38, 39, 61]. Despite the demonstrated utility of AFVs, respondents still desire ranges to be similar to that of a conventionally fuelled car, even when travel diaries showed that they were usually travelling less on a daily basis [38, 61]. Acceptable driving ranges are found to be 160  km for EVs [38, 54] up to 480  km for HFCVs [61]. On the other hand, consumer preferences might emerge with respect to the new qualities of AFVs (e.g., quiet ride, low maintenance costs) [38, 54, 55]. In this respect, Kurani et al. [55] argue that multi-vehicle households will combine AFVs and conventional vehicles in their stock to achieve the advantages of the different propulsion systems. These “hybrid households” will not be discouraged by the limited driving range of AFVs as they allocate household travel according to the different operational characteristics of the vehicles (i.e., conventional vehicles for longer trips, AFVs for shorter trips). The attractiveness of AFVs will not lie in their competitive, but in their complementary relation to conventionally <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicles.</b> In addition, Kurani and his colleagues assert that any disutility of reduced range can be more than offset by the value of home recharging [9, 11, 55]. They stipulate that a succesful market launch of AFVs will not depend on the duplication of the performance attributes of conventionally <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicles,</b> but on the recognition that there is a potential market for less ambitious AFV designs with shorter driving ranges. According to these authors, the commercialisation of more ambitious AFVs should be inevitably accompanied with financial incentives, large-scale vehicle demonstrations and persuasive information campaigns to overcome the financial barriers and the lack of inherent interest.|$|R

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{modeling of}} the fast-fill process occurring in Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) <b>fuelled</b> <b>vehicle</b> storage cylinders {{is a complex}} process and should be thoroughly studied. Final in-cylinder conditions should meet appropriate cylinder safety standards. The composition of natural gas {{plays an important role}} on its thermodynamic properties and consequently, on the fast-fill process and the final conditions. Here, a theoretical analysis has been developed to study the effects of the natural gas composition on the filling process of an onboard Natural Gas Vehicle (NGV) cylinder. The cylinder is assumed as a lumped system. The analysis is based on laws of thermodynamics and mass balance. Based on AGA 8 Equation of State (EOS) and thermodynamics relationships, the required properties of natural gas mixtures have been calculated. The results are presented for an adiabatic system. The results show that the compositions of natural gas have great effects on the filling process and final in-cylinder conditions. Furthermore, the gas with less methane percentage in its composition is more suitable for the filling process...|$|R
