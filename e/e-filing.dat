25|$|In 1995, the IRS {{began to}} use the public Internet for {{electronic}} filing. Since the introduction of <b>e-filing,</b> self-paced online tax services have flourished, augmenting the work of tax accountants, who were sometimes replaced.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, the IRS {{struck a}} deal with tax {{software}} vendors: The IRS would not develop online filing software and, in return, software vendors would provide free <b>e-filing</b> to most Americans. In 2009, 70% of filers qualified for free electronic filing of federal returns.|$|E
50|$|Taxpayers can <b>e-file</b> free {{using the}} IRS Free File service, either using an {{authorized}} IRS <b>e-file</b> provider's tax software, if eligible, or by using online fillable forms.|$|R
50|$|In November 2009, Congress {{adopted a}} {{provision}} that required federal tax return preparers to use IRS <b>e-file</b> to submit returns. Beginning in 2012, if a preparer expected to prepare and file eleven or more individual tax returns, {{he or she was}} expected to electronically file the returns. In order to <b>e-file,</b> a preparer must become an Authorized IRS <b>e-file</b> Provider. Preparers were {{to be able to use}} IRS e-services to submit an application.|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) goal is to receive 80 percent of all major types of tax returns electronically by 2012. Legislation passed in November 2009 supports the 80 percent goal for individual income tax returns by requiring tax return preparers who file more than 10 individual returns per year to file them electronically, or <b>e-file.</b> GAO was asked to review IRS's implementation of this <b>e-file</b> mandate. Specifically, GAO (1) described <b>e-file</b> rates and preparers' experiences implementing the mandate, (2) assessed IRS's plans to enforce the mandate, (3) assessed IRS's analysis of options for digitizing more data from paper returns, and (4) determined whether there are any tax forms IRS cannot accept electronically and assessed IRS's plans for adding them to the <b>e-file</b> system. To conduct these analyses, GAO reviewed IRS processing data and <b>e-file</b> planning documents, and interviewed IRS officials and 26 members of national preparer organizations. ...|$|R
25|$|Refund Banker scheme {{introduced}} in 2007 eliminated the scope for {{corruption in the}} Refunds of Excessive Tax collected by the Department. Introduction of <b>E-filing</b> of Taxes and effective implementation of Permanent Account Number (PAN) are some revolutionary steps that reduced the scope for corruption at all levels while improving {{the efficiency of the}} whole system. Use of Centralised Processing Center setup in 2010 at Bangalore of the Income Tax Department reduced unnecessary delays in processing returns. These computerization initiatives have freed up the human resources in the department which are largely responsible for higher revenue collections.|$|E
25|$|Many {{counties}} use the New York State Courts Electronic Filing System {{for electronic}} court filing (<b>e-filing,</b> like the federal PACER system). The New York State Reporter of the New York State Law Reporting Bureau {{is the official}} reporter of decisions and is required to publish every opinion, memorandum, and motion sent to it by the Court of Appeals and the Appellate Divisions of the Supreme Court in the New York Reports and Appellate Division Reports, respectively. The appellate term and trial court opinions are published selectively in the Miscellaneous Reports. The State Reporter is appointed by the Court of Appeals. The current versions are the New York Reports 3d (cited as N.Y.3d), the Appellate Division Reports 3d (cited as A.D.3d) and the Miscellaneous Reports 3d (cited as Misc.3d).|$|E
25|$|During the transition, many {{or most of}} the {{employees}} of the IRS (105,978 in 2005) would face loss of employment. The Beacon Hill Institute estimate is that the federal government would be able to cut $8 billion from the IRS budget of $11.01 billion (in 2007), reducing the size of federal tax administration by 73%. In addition, income tax preparers (many seasonal), tax lawyers, tax compliance staff in medium-to-large businesses, and software companies which sell tax preparation software (such as Drake Software, TaxCut, and TurboTax), could face significant drops, changes, or loss of employment. Proponents state the income tax industry often provides year-round services for financial planning and investment, which is expected to increase under the FairTax proposal and could offset some of these changes. New technologies used by the IRS, such as <b>e-filing,</b> are simplifying the process and already threatening a portion of this industry as goals set by Congress call for at least 80% of federal returns to be submitted electronically by 2007. According to IRS testimony from 2004, 45% of revenue agents and officers would become eligible for retirement in the following 5 years and there is concern about the loss of their work force as their hiring efforts struggle to keep pace with attrition. In addition, the IRS would not go completely out of commission until 3 years after the FairTax was enacted, providing employees time to find other employment. Proponents claim the projected 10.5% growth in the economy {{during the first year of}} the FairTax would provide plenty of new jobs to these workers that are typically well educated and well equipped with transferable skills (see creative destruction).|$|E

5000|$|An {{isolated}} pawn on the d-file {{is called}} an isolated queen pawn or simply an isolani. In {{addition to the}} open or half-open c- and <b>e-files,</b> the isolated queen pawn can provide a good outpost on the c- and <b>e-file</b> squares diagonally forward of the pawn, which are especially favorable for the player's knights. The isolated queen pawn position favors a [...] attack, freeing both the light and dark-squared bishops due {{to the absence of}} friendly pawns on the c- and <b>e-files.</b> Isolated queen pawns suffer, however, from the same weaknesses as other isolated pawns.|$|R
50|$|In chess, doubled pawns are two pawns of {{the same}} color {{residing}} on the same file. Pawns can become doubled only when one pawn captures onto a file on which another friendly pawn resides. In the diagram, the pawns on the b-file and <b>e-file</b> are doubled. The pawns on the <b>e-file</b> are doubled and isolated.|$|R

IRS Form 990-N is an annual electronic IRS filing for tax-exempt organizations with less than $50,000 in annual gross receipts. In 2013, Aplos added tax preparation and <b>e-file</b> software for IRS Form 990-EZ and its required schedules to Aplos <b>e-File.</b> IRS Form 990-EZ is the short form of the full Form 990 IRS tax forms and is available to organizations with up to $200,000 in gross receipts and $500,000 in assets.|$|R
