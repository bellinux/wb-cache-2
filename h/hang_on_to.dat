5|$|Roope, who drowned when {{he could}} no longer <b>hang</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> a rope whilst being pulled {{up the side of the}} cruiser, was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, thus {{becoming}} the first VC recipient of the Second World War. The award was justified, in part, by the recommendation of Heye, who wrote to the British authorities via the Red Cross, giving a statement of the valiant courage Roope had shown when engaging a much superior ship in close battle. Ramsay was also awarded the DSO. Both awards were made after the end of the war.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1969 Torrijos went to Mexico on holiday. A coup was {{launched}} in his absence, in which Noriega's loyalty allowed Torrijos to <b>hang</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> power, greatly enhancing Torrijos's image. Torrijos promoted Noriega {{to the position of}} lieutenant colonel and appointed him chief of military intelligence in August 1970: Noriega had gone from being a captain to a lieutenant colonel in just a year and a half, and according to Dinges, had left his undisciplined past behind him. Torrijos retained power as a military ruler until 1981: during this time he negotiated the Torrijos–Carter Treaties with U.S. President Jimmy Carter, which ensured that control over the Panama Canal would pass to Panama in 1999. These treaties, as well as a new labor code that included maternity leave, collective bargaining rights, and bonus pay, made Torrijos popular in Panama despite the absence of democratic elections. Galván writes that Torrijos's relationship with Noriega was symbiotic; Torrijos provided the political acumen, while Noriega enforced his unpopular decisions with force, when necessary. Noriega would provide intelligence, and carry out covert operations, that were critical to Torrijos successfully negotiating the release of the Panama Canal from the U.S.|$|E
5|$|In 1714, {{with the}} {{accession}} of George I, the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Hanover both {{came to be}} ruled in personal union by the House of Hanover. Early Hanoverian monarchs were careful to keep the heirlooms of the two realms separate. George III gave half the British heirlooms to his bride, Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, as a wedding present. In her will, Charlotte left the jewels to the 'House of Hanover'. The Kingdom of Hanover followed the Salic Law, whereby the line of succession went through male heirs. Thus, when Queen Victoria acceded to the throne of the United Kingdom, her uncle Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale became King of Hanover. King Ernest demanded {{a portion of the}} jewellery, not only as the monarch of Hanover but also as the son of Queen Charlotte. Victoria flatly declined to hand over any of the jewels, claiming they had been bought with British money. Ernest's son, George V of Hanover, continued to press the claim. Victoria's husband, Prince Albert, suggested that she make a financial settlement with the Hanoverian monarch to keep the jewels, but Parliament informed the Queen they would neither purchase the jewels nor loan funds for the purpose. A parliamentary commission was set up to investigate the matter and in 1857 they found in favour of the House of Hanover. On 28 January 1858, 10 years after Ernest's death, the jewels were handed to the Hanoverian Ambassador, Count Kielmansegg. Victoria did manage to <b>hang</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> one of her favourite pieces of jewellery: a fine rope of pearls.|$|E

5|$|The Doctor {{explains}} that crossing the Void causes a traveller to become saturated in Void material. If {{he opens the}} breach and reverses it, anything saturated in Void material will be pulled in. Everyone except Jackie has crossed the breach and is thus vulnerable to being trapped in the Void, so the Doctor sends them all to the parallel universe. Rose decides she would rather be with the Doctor than her family and jumps back to help him. The Cybermen attempt to stop the Doctor but are repelled by a converted Ms. Hartman, who has resisted the effects of her conversion and at least partially retains her sense of self. The Doctor and Rose open the breach and <b>hang</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> magnetic clamps as the Cybermen and Daleks are pulled in. The Cult of Skaro use an emergency temporal shift to escape. Rose's lever slips, and in resetting it she loses her grip and plunges toward the Void. At the last second, Pete reappears and grabs her, and together they transport back to the parallel universe. The breach closes, leaving a devastated Rose trapped in the parallel universe. The devices used to travel between the two worlds have also stopped working. The Doctor presses his ear against the wall, as a tearful Rose does {{the same in the}} other universe, as if trying to listen for each other.|$|E

25|$|The airport's {{value was}} {{estimated}} at NOK20 million. A sabotage of the drainage system was discovered in 1949, which explained many of the technical challenges affiliated with the runways.

Game five was sent into double overtime for Nathan Horton to win it 2–1 for Boston, but in game six, Montreal scored twice on 5-on-3 power plays and won it 2–1.

25|$|Having a keen {{investment}} eye for value, Slim {{adhered to}} his value investment practices {{with a long}} history of buying stakes in companies he sees as undervalued.

In addition, his conglomerate structure allows Slim to purchase numerous stakes that it is made nearly recession proof if one or more sectors of the economy do not do well. Slim also doesn't address the finer details of the business but instead focuses on business fundamentals where his strategy is buy an asset at an undervalued price for its underlying cash flow and eventually sell his stake for greater profit when the asset gains value, or simply hang to the business for its cash flow.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} {{problems in the}} 1970s, {{in the wake of}} the 1973 oil crisis marked a difficult period for Bordeaux. A series of scandals coincided with a commercial crisis in Bordeaux. The vintage of 1972 had been overpriced as was 1973 and 1974. And when the market crashed the négociants were stuck with overpriced wine that they could not sell. The early 1980s saw a new trend. Inheritance taxes were doubled in 1981 and on top of the crisis in the 1970s, many families found it increasingly difficult to <b>hang</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> their châteaux. Enter domestic and foreign insurance companies, banks and other corporate giants. Some of these companies were looking for a quick profit, others were in it as a long-term investment. But the 1980s decade wasn't all bad. It also saw more great vintages in a single decade than ever before and a new era in other respects. First, wine critics (rather than just official classifications) started to have an influence on demand and prices. Wine critic Robert M. Parker, Jr. reviewed the 1982 Bordeaux vintage as the most sumptuous vintage in decades. Not only was this a turning point for Bordeaux wine economically, it also represented the beginning of an American domination of the reviewing of wine, especially Bordeaux. The result was a broader appeal of Bordeaux wine where the presence of fruit became a much more important factor than previously.|$|E
25|$|Returning home, Toronto {{sought to}} extend their 8-game winning streak against the Oakland Athletics. Drew Hutchison pitched into the eighth inning {{for the first time}} since May, as the Blue Jays won, 4–2. Toronto's offence {{exploded}} once again in the second game, scoring 7 runs in the second inning and winning 10–3, making them the first team since the 1977 Kansas City Royals to have 2 10-game winning streaks in a season. The Blue Jays also took a half-game lead on the Yankees in the AL East with the win. In the finale, Athletics starter Sonny Gray was scratched due to back spasms, and former Blue Jay Jesse Chavez started in his place. Mark Buehrle pitched another gem, allowing 2 runs in 7 innings of work to lead Toronto to a 4–2 victory. The win made the 2015 Blue Jays the first team to have 2 11-game winning streaks since the 1954 Cleveland Indians. Looking {{to extend their}} winning streak to a franchise-record 12 games, the Blue Jays played against the Yankees for 3 games, this time in Toronto. David Price pitched well through 7 innings, before leaving in the eighth with 2 baserunners. Aaron Sanchez would give up a three-run home run to Carlos Beltrán, and New York would <b>hang</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> beat the Jays 4–3, ending their streak, and knocking Toronto out of first place in the AL East. In the middle game of the series, the Blue Jays were shut down by Yankees ace Masahiro Tanaka, who pitched a complete game and gave up only 1 run. The Blue Jays avoided the sweep, taking the series finale by a score of 3–1.|$|E
