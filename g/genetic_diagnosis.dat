5|$|<b>Genetic</b> <b>diagnosis</b> in HHT is difficult, as {{mutations}} {{occur in}} numerous different {{locations in the}} linked genes, without particular mutations being highly frequent (as opposed to, for instance, the ΔF508 mutation in cystic fibrosis). Sequence analysis of the involved genes is therefore the most useful approach (sensitivity 75%), followed by additional testing to detect large deletions and duplications (additional 10%). Not all mutations in these genes have been linked with disease.|$|E
5|$|Embryos {{produced}} {{using in}} vitro fertilization may be genetically tested for HD using preimplantation <b>genetic</b> <b>diagnosis</b> (PGD). This technique, where one or two cells are extracted from a typically 4- to 8-cell embryo and then tested for the genetic abnormality, can then be used to ensure embryos affected with HD genes are not implanted, and therefore any offspring will not inherit the disease. Some forms of preimplantation genetic diagnosis—non-disclosure or exclusion testing—allow at-risk people to have HD-free offspring without revealing their own parental genotype, giving no information about whether they themselves are destined to develop HD. In exclusion testing, the embryos' DNA is {{compared with that of}} the parents and grandparents to avoid inheritance of the chromosomal region containing the HD gene from the affected grandparent. In non-disclosure testing, only disease-free embryos are replaced in the uterus while the parental genotype and hence parental risk for HD are never disclosed.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Liposarcoma {{is one of}} {{the most}} common soft tissue sarcomas in adults, {{occurring}} in 15 to 20 % of all patients with sarcoma. Primary liposarcoma of the stomach is rare. We report a case of patient with giant gastric liposarcoma who underwent surgery after a gastrointestinal bleeding. Preoperative hystopathological diagnosis was not established, even after three biopsy attempts.

25|$|Preimplantation <b>genetic</b> <b>diagnosis.</b> By {{retrieving}} the mother's {{eggs for}} in vitro fertilization, {{it is possible}} to test the embryo for the disorder prior to implantation. Healthy embryos are then selected and transferred into the mother's womb, while unhealthy embryos are discarded. In addition to Tay–Sachs disease, preimplantation <b>genetic</b> <b>diagnosis</b> has been used to prevent cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia among other genetic disorders.|$|E

25|$|Thalassemias are genetic {{disorders}} {{inherited from}} a person's parents. There {{are two main}} types, alpha thalassemia and beta thalassemia. The severity of alpha and beta thalassemia depends on {{how many of the}} four genes for alpha globin or two genes for beta globin are missing. Diagnosis is typically by blood tests including a complete blood count, special hemoglobin tests, and <b>genetic</b> tests. <b>Diagnosis</b> may occur before birth through prenatal testing.|$|R

50|$|Because LAL {{deficiency}} is inherited, each sibling of an affected {{individual has}} a 25% {{chance of having}} pathological mutations in LAL genes from both their mother and their father, a 50% chance of having a pathological mutation in only one gene, and a 25% chance of having no pathological mutations.

25|$|APBD {{can only}} be {{prevented}} if parents undergo genetic screening to understand their risk of producing a child with the condition; if in vitro fertilization is used, then preimplantation <b>genetic</b> <b>diagnosis</b> {{can be done to}} identify fertilized eggs that do not carry two copies of mutated GBE1.|$|E
25|$|Economically, for carrier couples of cystic fibrosis, when {{comparing}} preimplantation <b>genetic</b> <b>diagnosis</b> (PGD) with natural conception (NC) followed by prenatal testing and abortion of affected pregnancies, PGD provides net economic benefits up to a maternal age around 40 years, after which NC, prenatal testing, and abortion have higher economic benefit.|$|E
25|$|The {{preimplantation}} <b>genetic</b> <b>diagnosis</b> for aneuploidy (PGS/PGD-A) is {{an accepted}} method as well.

30|$|The {{molecular}} {{specificity of}} MB is another unique advantage. MBs are extremely target specific and are practically effective in {{single nucleotide polymorphism}} (SNP) detection. Conventional technique for SNP detection is time consuming and labor-intensive but MBs offer a simple and direct means for <b>genetic</b> disease <b>diagnosis</b> and in gene therapy studies [5]. Studies have shown that hybridization from perfect complimentary DNA sequence and nonhybridization from mismatch DNA sequence occur at a wider temperature for MB probes than for traditional oligonucleotide linear probes [21].|$|R

25|$|Genetic testing, {{also known}} as DNA testing, allows the {{determination}} of bloodlines and the <b>genetic</b> <b>diagnosis</b> of vulnerabilities to inherited diseases.

25|$|Preimplantation <b>genetic</b> <b>diagnosis</b> (PGD or PIGD) {{refers to}} genetic {{profiling}} of embryos prior to implantation (as {{a form of}} embryo profiling), and sometimes even of oocytes prior to fertilization. When used to screen for a specific genetic sequence, its main advantage is that it avoids selective pregnancy termination, as the method makes it highly likely that a selected embryo will {{be free of the}} condition under consideration.|$|E
25|$|Compound {{heterozygosity}} {{is one of}} {{the causes}} of variation in genetic disease. The diagnosis and nomenclature for such disorders sometimes reflects history, because most diseases were first observed and classified based on biochemistry and pathophysiology before <b>genetic</b> <b>diagnosis</b> was available. Some genetic disorders are really a family of related disorders that occur in the same metabolic pathway, or in related pathways. Naming conventions for the disease became established before precise molecular diagnosis was possible.|$|E

25|$|Advances in genetic {{technology}} allow clinical geneticists to link {{an estimated}} 40% of ASD cases to genetic causes; {{in one study}} the diagnostic yield for AS, PDD-NOS and atypical autism {{was similar to that}} for classic autism. <b>Genetic</b> <b>diagnosis</b> is relatively expensive, and genetic screening is generally impractical. As genetic tests are developed several ethical, legal, and social issues will emerge. Commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results, given the complexity of the genetics.|$|E
25|$|Embryos who {{reach the}} day 3 cell stage {{can be tested}} for {{chromosomal}} or specific genetic defects prior to possible transfer by preimplantation <b>genetic</b> <b>diagnosis</b> (PGD). Transferring at the blastocyst stage confers {{a significant increase in}} live birth rate per transfer, but also confers a decreased number of embryos available for transfer and embryo cryopreservation, so the cumulative clinical pregnancy rates are increased with cleavage stage transfer. Transfer day 2 instead of day 3 after fertilization has no differences in live birth rate.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} patient {{deferoxamine}} complaint {{is that they}} are painful and inconvenient. The oral chelator deferasirox was approved for use in 2005 in some countries, it offers some hope with compliance at a higher cost. Bone marrow transplantation is the only cure and is indicated for patients with severe thalassemia major. Transplantation can eliminate a patient's dependence on transfusions. Absent a matching donor, a savior sibling can be conceived by preimplantation <b>genetic</b> <b>diagnosis</b> (PGD) to be free of the disease as well as to match the recipient's human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type.|$|E
