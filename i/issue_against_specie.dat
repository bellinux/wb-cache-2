50|$|Prior to 1838 a bank charter {{could be}} {{obtained}} only by a specific legislative act, but in that year New York adopted the Free Banking Act, which permitted anyone to engage in banking, upon compliance with certain charter conditions. The Michigan Act (1837) allowed the automatic chartering of banks that would fulfill its requirements without special consent of the state legislature. These banks could <b>issue</b> bank notes <b>against</b> <b>specie</b> (gold and silver coins) and the states regulated the reserve requirements, interest rates for loans and deposits, the necessary capital ratio etc. Free banking spread rapidly to other states, and from 1840 to 1863 all banking business was done by state-chartered institutions.|$|R
5000|$|In this period, only state-chartered banks existed. They could <b>issue</b> bank notes <b>against</b> <b>specie</b> (gold {{and silver}} coins) {{and the states}} heavily {{regulated}} their own reserve requirements, interest rates for loans and deposits, the necessary capital ratio etc. These banks had existed since 1781, in parallel with the Banks of the United States. The Michigan Act (1837) allowed the automatic chartering of banks that would fulfill its requirements without special consent of the state legislature. This legislation made creating unstable banks easier by lowering state supervision in states that adopted it. The real value of a bank bill was often lower than its face value, and the issuing bank's financial strength generally determined {{the size of the}} discount. By 1797 there were 24 chartered banks in the U.S.; with the beginning of the Free Banking Era (1837) there were 712.During the free banking era, the banks were short-lived compared to today's commercial banks, with an average lifespan of five years. About half of the banks failed, and about a third of which went out of business because they could not redeem their notes. (See also [...] "Wildcat banking".) ...|$|R
5000|$|Within {{the context}} of a fixed specie basis for money, one {{important}} controversy was between the quantity theory of money and the real bills doctrine (RBD). Within this context, quantity theory applies to the level of fractional reserve accounting allowed <b>against</b> <b>specie,</b> generally gold, held by a bank. Currency and banking schools of economics argue the RBD, that banks should also be able to <b>issue</b> currency <b>against</b> bills of trading, which is [...] "real bills" [...] that they buy from merchants. This theory was important in the 19th century in debates between [...] "Banking" [...] and [...] "Currency" [...] schools of monetary soundness, and {{in the formation of the}} Federal Reserve. In the wake of the collapse of the international gold standard post 1913, and the move towards deficit financing of government, RBD has remained a minor topic, primarily of interest in limited contexts, such as currency boards. It is generally held in ill repute today, with Frederic Mishkin, a governor of the Federal Reserve going so far as to say it had been [...] "completely discredited." ...|$|R
