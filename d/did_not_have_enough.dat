5|$|During operations, the He 111Z <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> {{power to}} lift a fully loaded Me 321. Some He 111s were {{supplemented}} by rocket pods for extra takeoff thrust, {{but this was not}} a fleet-wide action. Two rockets were mounted beneath each fuselage and one underneath each wing. This added 500kg (1,100lb) in weight. The pods were then released by parachute after takeoff.|$|E
5|$|However, the U.S. <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> troops; Cutler, whose brigade was {{deployed}} {{north of}} the Chambersburg Pike, had his right flank in the air. The leftmost division of the XI Corps was unable to deploy in time to strengthen the line, so Doubleday was forced to throw in reserve brigades to salvage his line.|$|E
5|$|Rudd {{initially}} {{said that}} he would challenge Gillard, but it soon became apparent that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> support within the party to survive in his position. Hours before the vote on 24 June, he resigned as Prime Minister and Leader of the Labor Party, leaving Gillard to assume the leadership unopposed. Treasurer Wayne Swan was at the same time elected unopposed to succeed Gillard as Deputy Leader.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the band}} <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> time to sell any records while touring, the album became Metal Blade Records' highest selling release. Five {{thousand}} copies was the label's average. Show No Mercy {{went on to}} sell between 15,500 and 20,000 copies in the United States; it also went on to sell more than 15,000 overseas, as Metal Blade had worldwide rights. The success of the album led to Slagel wanting the band to release a new record and an extended play.|$|E
5|$|Having {{achieved}} {{stability in}} the West, Alexios could turn {{his attention to the}} severe economic difficulties and the disintegration of the Empire's traditional defences. However, he still <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> manpower to recover the lost territories in Asia Minor and to advance against the Seljuks. At the Council of Piacenza in 1095, envoys from Alexios spoke to Pope Urban II about the suffering of the Christians of the East, and underscored that without help from the West they would continue to suffer under Muslim rule.|$|E
5|$|In {{their first}} weeks on board, the Expedition 1 crew members {{activated}} critical {{life support systems}} and computer control, as well as unpacked supplies left behind for them by previous supply missions. At this time the station <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> electricity to heat all three pressurized modules, so Unity was left unused and unheated.

5|$|Medstead Church of England Primary School lies {{immediately}} {{south of}} the village near the cemetery. Under the Education Act 1944, the previous site of Medstead's school was declared inadequate as it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> space to accommodate a playing field and assembly hall. The school was consequently relocated to a larger site {{south of the}} village, where it is today. A pre-school has been in operation since September 1989, located in {{the grounds of the}} primary school after a successful petition ensured its relocation from the village hall.|$|E
5|$|The missile silo {{used for}} the episode's climactic scene was {{incomplete}} when the scene was filmed, as the crew <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> time or money left to complete the set. The crew built the incomplete silo on a sound stage around a completed spacecraft prop, {{and were able to}} digitally extend the set with computer generated interiors to give the impression of a much larger silo. Exterior shots of the silo building were also enhanced digitally, with various buildings and machinery created with computer generated imagery and composited into the exterior shots.|$|E
5|$|When Clark {{finally left}} Fort Pitt in August 1781, he was {{accompanied}} by only 400 men, although he expected to meet Lochry and his Pennsylvanians at Fort Henry (present Wheeling, West Virginia). Clark was angry {{about the lack of}} support given his campaign, but he still hoped that the Kentucky militia, who were to rendezvous with him at Fort Nelson (Louisville, Kentucky), would provide additional men. He intended to at least carry out an expedition against enemy Indians if he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> men to attack Detroit.|$|E

5|$|Wider {{management}} failings {{were found}} by the investigation to {{have contributed to the}} explosion: management safety checks at the site were found to be deficient and not properly followed. Site staff did not have control over the flow rates and timing of two of the three inlet sources, meaning that they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> information to properly manage the storage of incoming fuel. Further, overall throughput had increased, reducing wait times further and shifting the emphasis to process operations instead of process safety.|$|E
5|$|Alex Weldon {{was hired}} to be {{supervisor}} of special effects for the film. Weldon was planning on retiring after 42years of effects work, but his wife urged him to take on Star Trek because she thought he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> to do. When Weldon was hired, many of the effects had already been started or completed by Rugg; {{it was up to}} Weldon to complete more complex and higher-budgeted effects for the motion picture. The first step of preparation involved analyzing the script in the number, duration, and type of effects. Before costs could be determined and Weldon could shop for necessary items, he and {{the other members of the}} special effects team worked out all possibilities for pulling off the effects in a convincing manner.|$|E
5|$|Apple {{approached}} Sony in late 1989 {{because it}} <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> engineers {{to handle the}} number of new products that were planned for delivery in 1991. Using a basic blueprint from Apple, including a list of chips and other components, and the Portable's architecture, the 100 was miniaturized and manufactured by Sony in San Diego, California, and Japan. Sony engineers had little experience building personal computers but nonetheless completed Apple's smallest and lightest machine in under 13months, cancelling other projects and giving the PowerBook100 top priority. Sony president Norio Ohga gave project manager Kihey Yamamoto permission to recruit engineers from any Sony division.|$|E

5|$|Enron's {{aggressive}} {{accounting practices}} were not {{hidden from the}} board of directors, as later learned by a Senate subcommittee. The board was informed of the rationale for using the Whitewing, LJM, and Raptor transactions, and after approving them, received status updates on the entities' operations. Although not all of Enron's widespread improper accounting practices were revealed to the board, the practices were dependent on board decisions. Even though Enron extensively relied on derivatives for its business, the company's Finance Committee and board <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> experience with derivatives to understand what they were being told. The Senate subcommittee argued that had there been a detailed {{understanding of how the}} derivatives were organized, the board would have prevented their use.|$|E
5|$|Following its release, Most Wanted {{received}} mostly negative {{reviews from}} critics, who deemed the release as premature, stating that Duff <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> material {{to warrant a}} compilation. However, the Dead Executives-produced tracks received favorable comments; critics wrote that they stood out {{from the rest of}} the album. In the United States, the album debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart, becoming Duff's second number one album there. It was later certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Elsewhere, it debuted at number one in Canada, and reached the top ten in Australia, Ireland, Italy, Japan and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|General Grant had Commander Henry Walke {{bring the}} Carondelet up the Cumberland River {{to create a}} {{diversion}} by opening fire on the fort. The Confederates responded with shots from their long-range guns and eventually hit the gunboat. Walke retreated several miles below the fort, but soon returned and continued shelling the water batteries. General McClernand, in the meantime, had been attempting to stretch his men toward the river but ran into difficulties with a Confederate battery of guns. McClernand ultimately decided that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> men to stretch {{all the way to}} the river, so Grant decided to call on more troops. He sent orders to General Wallace, who had been left behind at Fort Henry, to bring his men to Fort Donelson.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{before going}} to the Archives in autumn 2006, Farrar invited his Gob Iron {{collaborator}} Anders Parker to come with him and look over potential material and the two returned several times over a period of months gathering lyrics for composition before recording together starting on July 14, 2007. As they found lyrics that interested them, they had reproductions mailed to their homes from the Archives to work on the material at their leisure. The duo finished recording several songs throughout the year but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> material to complete the album. The recordings were also made without a budget or record contract for release.|$|E
5|$|In Lindsay Lohan's Indian Journey, Lohan meets and {{interviews}} victims of human trafficking in Delhi, Kolkata and {{a village in}} West Bengal. They talk about the exploitation and abuse they have experienced, describing sexual slavery, physical abuse and difficulties in bringing their traffickers to justice. She also talks to a former trafficker and parents of trafficked children. One trafficked boy says {{that he can not}} go back home because his mother is ill. A mother who trafficked her daughter describes how her family <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> food, and how even though they never received the promised payments for her daughter's work, at least she was fed.|$|E
5|$|Jean {{was one of}} {{the writers}} and {{producers}} who worked on The Simpsons Movie, a feature-length film that was released in 2007. The show's voice cast was signed on to do the film in 2001, and work then began on the script. The producers of The Simpsons were initially worried that creating a film would {{have a negative effect on}} the show, as they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>enough</b> crew to focus their attention on both projects. As the show progressed, additional writers and animators were hired so that both the show and the film could be produced at the same time. Groening and Brooks were therefore able to invite Jean (who continued to work as show runner on the television show) to produce the film with them.|$|E
