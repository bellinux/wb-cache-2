25|$|These tenses (except for present perfect) {{correspond}} roughly to equivalent English perfect tenses (<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>read</b> / I {{will have}} read). They {{are used in}} various contexts for very different meanings, but they usually indicate an action that happened before another action said with another verb, noun or similar: Tos knygos neėmiau, nes jau ją buvau skaitęs – I didn’t take that book because I had already read it; Po kelionės vaikai bus labai pasiilgę tėvų – After the trip the children will have badly missed their parents.|$|E

Of this great number two only offered insults to the gang of prisoners....But little and petty as it was it galled horribly. The soldiers felt the sting and scowled back; the officers looked straight before them. Yet it was a valuable lesson. Only a few days before <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>read</b> in the newspapers of how the Kaffirs had jeered at the Boer prisoners when they were marched into Pietermaritzburg, saying, 'Where are your passes?'

You could raise a question about how relevant it {{was likely to be}} in Columbia, Missouri, but it was in any case a worthy cause. We also planned a socialist picnic, which we spent quite a lot of time organizing. Eventually, I regret to say, the YPSL chapter, after much discussion, many debates and some downright quarrels, broke up over the socialist picnic. I thought that was rather discouraging.|$|E

"The general discontent I {{felt with}} woman's portion as wife, housekeeper, physician, and spiritual guide, the chaotic {{conditions}} into which everything fell without her constant supervision, and the wearied, anxious {{look of the}} majority of women, impressed me with a strong feeling that some active measures should be taken to remedy the wrongs of society in general, and of women in particular. My experience at the World Anti-slavery Convention, all <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>read</b> of the legal status of women, and the oppression I saw everywhere, together swept across my soul, intensified now by many personal experiences.

[...] Then I began asking older authors, and they told me that 'there are no rules, nor can there be any, for the art of novel-writing.' [...] Then , brought to desperation, I set about trying to resolve for myself the question: [...] 'Can literary art be reduced to general rules?' [...] After several years of observing and thinking, the matter began to get clearer for me, and as early as August 1886 I set down my first notes [...] and, God willing, I hope to publish a scientific theory of literary art.

[...] "So my folks brought me piles of books from the Seattle Public Library," [...] he {{recalled}} in interview, [...] "and it was then I really learned to read and from that time on was voracious — I figure that accident changed my life.

2500|$|When {{the strike}} broke out, Ceaușescu {{and his wife}} Elena were on a Black Sea vacation. At Verdeț' insistence, he hastily came to Petroșani on August 3. 35,000 (some sources say 40,000) came to see him [...] to be sure, not all had come to hold a {{dialogue}} with him, but went out of curiosity or carried away by events, but the audience was nonetheless impressive in size. At first, despite the charged atmosphere, some shouted [...] "Ceaușescu and the miners!", but others yelled [...] "Lupeni '29! Lupeni '29!" [...] (in reference to the Lupeni Strike of 1929, enshrined in the mythology of the Romanian Communist Party), {{in an effort to}} add legitimacy to their cause. Dobre read the list of grievances to Ceaușescu, presenting 26 demands related to work hours, production targets, pensions, supplies, housing and investments. They asked for a restoration of the status quo ante in social legislation, the guarantee of adequate food supplies and medical care, the establishment of workers’ commissions at the enterprise level empowered to dismiss incompetent or corrupt managers, and a pledge of no reprisals against the strikers. After that, Dobre recalled, [...] "While my name was being shouted, I turned toward Ceaușescu, gave him the list from which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>read</b> and he said to me: 'Thank you for informing me, comrade'. Once in front of the microphones, Ceaușescu was not allowed to speak. Some were booing him, others shouted that they wouldn't go into the mine, and from afar one could hear my name. In vain the appeals for quiet with raised arms from the activists on the podium".|$|E

I knew what he did was special and wanted to be like that too – but I did not feel the same 'Wow – this is something else!" [...] kind of response that others report. I was impressed and intrigued – but not overawed. My journey to Japan was a personal spiritual quest and I realised that this man was someone you only get to be around once – he was a true mystic. Over the coming months and years I was to see him on a daily basis (when he was in Tokyo). As a karate man with both Judo and Jujitsu experience, I was not easily impressed by people flying through the air for apparently no reason. I had made a huge effort by modern standards to be there to learn what was on offer but – over the first few months I began to think – 'Can this really be true, these guys are just falling over...' Then, little by little, as other guys who had 'gone for him' described their bewildering experiences of falling ( [...] for no good reason [...] ) and also my own careful observations of the reactions of his Ukes – I was convinced that this man was incredible." ...|$|E
