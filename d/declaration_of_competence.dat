40|$|The {{participation}} of the European Union alongside its Member States in multilateral agreements can create situations of uncertainty for third parties. In {{order to deal with}} this uncertainty, the EU makes a declaration stating {{the extent to which the}} international agreement is governed by EU competence. However, these declarations of competence create uncertainty as regards their legal effects and effectiveness. This article aims to examine these issues by analysing these declarations from a practical perspective. The first section conceptualizes the declarations, first by establishing their basic features, second, indentifying their legal effects, and third, by identifying a list of problems attached to these instruments. The second section focuses on both the internal and the external practice regarding the declarations of competence. This section highlights how the increasing tendency of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to rely on the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> is not mirrored in the external sphere. In fact, no <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> has ever been invoked by a third party or used by an international court to apportion the responsibilities between the EU and its Member States.

The UN General Assembly's {{adoption of the}} ILC articles on the International Responsibility of International Organisations was only the catalyst for debate on this topic. In this book, the author examines the legal personality of the EU, how - if at all - its responsibility under international agreements is shared between Member States, and how the international responsibility of the EU relates to its internal responsibilities under EU law. By exploring how in practice such legal regimes as the ILC, UNCLOS, and the WTO have held the EU responsible, this book provides an innovative analysis of a fundamental aspect {{of the relationship between}} the EU and international law.

40|$|A {{requirement}} of many nurses {{in the process}} of licensing for practice each year is a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> continuing <b>competence</b> to practice. In Australia, each state and territory currently has its own regulatory authority for nurses and midwives,whose main role is to protect public safety. Like many other registering authorities in the Asia-Pacific region,Australian regulatory authorities undertake the random auditing of nurses and midwives in order to assess their competence to practice. Professional portfolios commonly are considered to be a tool that nurses can use to demonstrate to regulatory authorities, employers, and others how they meet the required competencies.

An options booklet and accompanying questionnaire were posted to a random sample of 2 % of RNs from all Sates and the Northern Territory in Australia. The sample consisted of 4, 133 RNs and 1005 completed questionnaires were returned representing a 24. 3 % response rate. Data were analysed using SPSSX.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} {{understand}} the nature of the legal relationship between the European Union and its Member States in their external relations regarding the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). It begins with an examination of the problems that the Union (at the time the European Economic Community) and its Member States encountered during the negotiations at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. In light of this, the thesis assesses the underlying reasons for the negotiation outcomes at the Conference. The thesis then considers <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence,</b> which were one of the major concessions that had to be made at the Conference for being allowed to become a member to UNCLOS. In doing so, it will assess the reasons for their introduction and the challenges that have been created as a result of having to declare competences to treaty partners. Having considered the relationship of Member States and the Union in relation to UNCLOS itself, the thesis will move on to examine their relationship in regard to the implementation of the external elements of UNLCOS obligations. First fisheries matters will be examined as an area, in which the Union has exclusive competence. This is followed by a consideration of matters of maritime safety, an area for which competence is shared by the Union and its Member States. In both areas the thesis will assess the elements required for the success of the Union's external relations. The final part of the thesis will further examine the role of the Court for the relationship between the Union and its Member States by examining the MOX Plant case and recent case law. They duty of cooperation will be a particular feature of this analysis. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Este trabajo estudia las cuestiones de competencia {{judicial}} internacional, derecho aplicable y reconocimiento de decisiones que plantean los supuestos de ausencia y declaración de fallecimiento vinculados con varios ordenamientos jurídicos. Como presupuesto, incluye un análisis sobre los diversos modelos de regulación de la ausencia y declaración de fallecimiento en el panorama comparado. [...] The Private International Law {{questions raised}} by the disappearance of persons are diverse and complex. This complexity {{is partly due to}} the different methods used by the various legal orders to regulate these factual situations. Spanish law is a typical representative of the so-called mixed systems, which includes both <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> absence and <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> death. As regards jurisdiction issues, a number of significant legal systems show a trend to admit flexible bases <b>of</b> <b>competence.</b> Such an approach is helpful to guarantee the fulfilment of the protective nature of these proceedings. In Spain the terms of Article 22. 3 LOPJ (which includes only the last domicile of the absent person as basis <b>of</b> <b>competence)</b> make necessary an interpretation providing a widening of the circumstances in what is appropriate for our courts to intervene (as they do in practice). Concerning choice of law the idea of applying the lex causae –the legal order which governs the relationship (marriage, succession…) affected by the disappearance- seems only reasonable in those legal systems based on judicial presumptions of death without generally binding effect (as is typical of the common law countries). In Spanish law, according to article 9. 1 C. c., the basic criterion is that absence and <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> death questions are governed by the law of the nationality of the absentee {{at the time of the}} disappearance. However, the distinction between procedure (governed by the lex fori) and substance raises here special difficulties. As far as recognition of foreign decisions in Spain is concerned, it is generally accepted that exequatur is not required due to the non-contentious nature of these proceedings. However, opinions vary regarding the conditions which these foreign decisions must fulfil. Finally the lack of effect of substantive res judicata which is proper of the non-contentious decisions for protective assistance and the possibility of revoking these decisions bring up special questions for discussion. ...|$|R

OBJECTIVES: Examine relationships between PMHNP perceptions <b>of</b> <b>competence,</b> prior basic-level nursing experience, {{and years of}} PMHNP practice. STUDY DESIGN: Self-ratings <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> were elicited by a questionnaire designed from Benner’s model. The relationship between prior nursing experience and perceptions <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> was examined by chi-square analysis. Changes in PMHNP competence rankings over years of practice were examined with Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney procedures. RESULTS: Self-perceptions <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> increased in seven role dimensions as PMHNPs progressed through years of practice (p <. 000).
