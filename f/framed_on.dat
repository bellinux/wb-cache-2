5|$|The {{historian}} Walter Goffart {{argues that}} Bede based {{the structure of}} the Historia on three works, using them as the framework around which the three main sections of the work were structured. For {{the early part of the}} work, up until the Gregorian mission, Goffart feels that Bede used Gildas's De excidio. The second section, detailing the Gregorian mission of Augustine of Canterbury was <b>framed</b> <b>on</b> the anonymous Life of Gregory the Great written at Whitby. The last section, detailing events after the Gregorian mission, Goffart feels were modelled on Stephen of Ripon's Life of Wilfrid. Most of Bede's informants for information after Augustine's mission came from the eastern part of Britain, leaving significant gaps in the knowledge of the western areas, which were those areas likely to have a native Briton presence.|$|E

25|$|The second-floor balcony is <b>framed</b> <b>on</b> {{either end}} by pilasters {{decorated}} with candelabra.

Pilasters decorated with candelabra are set between the four windows and the doors. A circular escutcheon framed with fruit-and-drapery swags tops each bay and the French doors, while fruit-and-drapery swags link the pilaters over the slit windows.|$|E

25|$|Many of the {{earliest}} churches of Byzantium have a longitudinal plan. At Hagia Sophia, Istanbul, there is a central dome, <b>framed</b> <b>on</b> one axis by two high semi-domes {{and on the other}} by low rectangular transept arms, the overall plan being square. This large church was to influence the building of many later churches, even into the 21st century. A square plan in which the nave, chancel and transept arms are of equal length forming a Greek cross, the crossing generally surmounted by a dome became the common form in the Orthodox Church, with many churches throughout Eastern Europe and Russia being built in this way. Churches of the Greek Cross form often have a narthex or vestibule which stretches across the front of the church. This type of plan was also to later play a part in the development of church architecture in Western Europe, most notably in Bramante's plan for St. Peter's Basilica.|$|E

50|$|The final between Davis and Lawrence {{was played}} from 14 to 17 May in Camkin's Hall in Birmingham. Lawrence and Davis shared the {{afternoon}} session but Davis won all four frames {{in the evening}} to lead 6-2 after the first day. Lawrence won three <b>frames</b> <b>on</b> the second evening but Davis still led 9-7 after two days play. Davis won three <b>frames</b> <b>on</b> the third afternoon and led 14-10 after the third day, needing just two <b>frames</b> <b>on</b> the final day. Lawrence won {{three of the four}} afternoon <b>frames</b> <b>on</b> the final day to reduce Davis's lead to 15-13.

The paparazzo then arrives at the scene and watches as Jackson vanishes under the covers of Billie Jean's bed. Trailed by the police, the paparazzo is then arrested for spying on Billie Jean. Jackson sported a new look for the video; Jackson's clothes, a black leather suit with a pink shirt and a red bow tie, were copied by children around the US.

500|$|At {{the eastern}} end, the communion table is set {{into a small}} apse with its semi-dome adorned with gold mosaic tiles that were added in 1960. The altar is a {{commemorative}} gift from the Lloyd family, whose son was the first server appointed at St James'. It generally has an altar frontal in the colour of the liturgical season or festival. With no structural choir area, the chancel is built out and {{into the body of}} the church as a platform enclosed within gated wrought iron and brass railings and approached by steps. [...] The mosaic floor of the chancel is ornately with designs showing the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit (Wisdom, Understanding, Counsel, Ghostly Strength, Knowledge, Godliness and Holy Fear) along with symbols of St James the Great (the staff, scrip, palm, scallop shell and hat of the pilgrim). The chancel is <b>framed</b> <b>on</b> either side by the organ pipes.|$|E
500|$|Following {{a police}} {{investigation}} that lasted over a year, on 21 August 1984 the trial against Heidemann and Kujau opened in Hamburg. Both men {{were charged with}} defrauding Stern of 9.3million DMs. Despite {{the seriousness of the}} charges facing the two men, Hamilton considers that [...] "it also appeared clear that the trial {{was going to be a}} farce, a real slapstick affair that would enrage the judge and amuse the entire world." [...] The proceedings lasted until July 1985, when both men were sent to prison: four years and eight months for Heidemann, four years and six months for Kujau. In September one of the supporting magistrates overseeing the case was replaced after he fell asleep; three days later the court were [...] "amused" [...] to see pictures of Idi Amin's underpants, which Heidemann had <b>framed</b> <b>on</b> his wall. At times the case [...] "denigrated into a slanging match" [...] between Kujau and Heidemann. In his summing up Judge Hans-Ulrich Schroeder said that [...] "the negligence of Stern has persuaded me to soften the sentences against the two main co-conspirators." [...] Heidemann was found guilty of stealing 1.7million DMs from Stern; Kujau guilty of receiving 1.5million DMs for his role in the forgeries. Despite the lengthy investigation and trial, at least fivemillion DMs remained unaccounted for.|$|E
500|$|The film, however, was {{not without}} its criticisms. Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice was more {{critical}} of the film. While praising Ejiofor's work, she stated: [...] "It's a picture that stays {{more than a few}} safe steps away from anything so dangerous as raw feeling. Even when it depicts inhuman cruelty, as it often does, it never compromises its aesthetic purity." [...] Peter Malamud Smith of Slate criticized the story, saying, [...] "12 Years a Slave is constructed as a story of a man trying to return to his family, offering every viewer a way into empathizing with its protagonist. Maybe we need a story <b>framed</b> <b>on</b> that individual scale in order to understand it. But it has a distorting effect all the same. We're more invested in one hero than in millions of victims; if we're forced to imagine ourselves enslaved, we want to imagine ourselves as Northup, a special person who miraculously escaped the system that attempted to crush him." [...] Describing this as [...] "the hero problem", Malamud Smith concluded his review explaining, [...] "We can handle 12 Years a Slave. But don't expect 60 Years a Slave any time soon. And 200 Years, Millions of Slaves? Forget about it." [...] Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club opined that McQueen is [...] "essentially tone-deaf when it comes to performance, and skirts by on casting". The film [...] "lacks a necessary emotional continuity. I don't think it's something the movie is denying in the way it intentionally denies so many other conventions; it's still structured around an ending that's supposed to function as a release, but because it can’t organize that sense of catharsis it so badly needs, it just feels as though McQueen is scurrying for an exit. Also: The cast is wildly uneven." [...] At The Guardian, black Canadian author Orville Lloyd Douglas said he would not be seeing 12 Years a Slave, explaining: [...] "I'm convinced these black race films are created for a white, liberal film audience to engender white guilt and make them feel bad about themselves. Regardless of your race, these films are unlikely to teach you anything you don't already know." ...|$|E
