500|$|The caption did {{apparently}} help sales: Landsborough subsequently {{commented that}} while Hamilton's other titles were selling perhaps 15,000 copies, Authentic managed to sell 30,000. After the banners were in place, Hamilton proposed launching a monthly sf magazine. Landsborough {{was concerned about}} the workload, and also felt {{it would be difficult to}} find enough good material; Hamilton refused to increase the pay rate, which was not high enough to attract the best stories. A compromise was reached, and Authentic was born as a monthly magazine in paperback format, with a single novel and a short editorial feature in each issue, plus an occasional short story. The eighth issue was the last on the fortnightly schedule. Issues 9–12 were titled [...] "Science Fiction Monthly" [...] in the <b>footer</b> of the cover. In mid-1951, Landsborough left Hamilton, and Campbell replaced him as editor of Authentic with the thirteenth issue, which was also the first one on which the title changed to [...] "Authentic Science Fiction".|$|E

2500|$|Els {{started the}} 2012 season {{in his home}} country at the Volvo Golf Champions where he {{finished}} in a tie for second place after he and Retief Goosen lost out in a playoff to Branden Grace.

[...] Els led the tournament for most of the final round and had the lead outright until the 16th hole.

Ultimately, Els' unsuccessful bids to qualify for the Masters was viewed as the likely end of his competitiveness on the PGA Tour.|$|E
