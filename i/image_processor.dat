5|$|The HTC One is {{equipped}} with a 4.0-megapixel rear-facing camera module that contains a custom image sensor marketed as UltraPixel, which is composed of pixels that are 2.0µm in size. Most high-end smartphones {{at the time of its}} release used 8- or 13-megapixel cameras with pixel sizes ranging from 1.4 to 1.0µm, both of which are considerably smaller in size than the pixels found in the One’s UltraPixel sensor. Although these smaller pixel sizes were typically necessary to ensure that the camera sensor did not compromise the design of the phone, there were concerns that this could result in a loss of dynamic range and sensitivity, and also result in poor performance in low-light environments. As such, HTC stated that its camera design with larger sensor pixels could notably increase overall image quality, especially in low-light environments. The camera also includes optical image stabilization, and is further enhanced by improvements to the Sense camera software and the ImageChip 2 <b>image</b> <b>processor.</b>|$|E

25|$|Compared {{with the}} newer concept of mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras, this mirror/prism {{system is the}} {{characteristic}} difference providing direct, accurate optical preview with separate autofocus and exposure metering sensors. Essential parts of all digital cameras are some electronics like amplifier, analog to digital converter, <b>image</b> <b>processor</b> and other (micro-)processors for processing the digital image, performing data storage and/or driving an electronic display.|$|E
500|$|Although often HD video capable cameras {{include an}} HDMI {{interface}} for playback or even live preview, the <b>image</b> <b>processor</b> and the video processor of cameras usable for uncompressed video {{must be able}} to deliver the full image resolution at the specified frame rate in realtime without any missing frames causing jitter.

500|$|X-Men: Days of Future Past is {{the first}} X-Men film to be filmed in native 3D; it was shot using Arri Alexa-M cameras with Leica Prime lenses and Fujinon Zoom lenses, along with 3ality Technica TS-35 camera rigs and Stereo <b>Image</b> <b>Processor</b> (SIP) {{technology}} systems. Director of photography Newton Thomas Sigel was asked about using Arri Alexa-M cameras; he said, [...] "For Bryan and myself, the Alexa has been almost the gateway to getting the look we like in film". Sigel added that the Arri Alexa-M camera's small size was a big advantage to the film's main unit, which carried three 3D rigs. The film also used the Alexa XTs for the production's 2D work.|$|E
