Loving offenders, I excuse you both thus: you love her, because you <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> her; similarly, she abuses me for my sake, in allowing my friend to have her. If I lose you, my loss is a gain to my love; and losing her, my friend picks up that loss. Both find each other, I lose both, and both lay this cross on me for my sake. But there is one consolation in this thought: my friend and I are one; therefore she loves me alone.|$|E

In 1958 after Tina's mom put her and her infant son Craig out of the house, she moved into Ike's home in East St. Louis. During that period, Ike began musically training Tina. At the beginning, the two had no mutual attraction; Tina felt Ike was not the [...] "ideal-looking man" [...] and felt {{he was like a}} brother. Tina preferred light-skinned guys better than dark-skinned guys. Ike viewed her as a sister and favored [...] "curvaceous women."

Nina explained her thoughts on the simple reinvention, saying [...] "Few <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> to dance and I’ve always wanted to show that side of me." [...] Lyrically, the song talks {{about a woman who}} wants to get back together with her lover after breaking-up with him. While the verses describe her desire for the relationship, the chorus was written in an opposite manner, where she goes to the club and dances her way to forgetting her lover: [...] "In the club I will raise my hands / I just wanna dance, dance, dance / On the thoughts of a new romance / I just wanna dance, dance, dance." [...] According to FORG of PhilCharts.com, the song [...] "has an irresistible beat that makes for a good club banger." ...|$|E
