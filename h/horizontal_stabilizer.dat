5|$|The Embraer jet, despite {{serious damage}} to the left <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer</b> and left winglet, was able to {{continue}} flying, though its autopilot disengaged and it required an unusual amount of force on the yoke to keep the wings level.|$|E
5|$|At 15:16, {{while the}} plane was in a shallow right turn at 37,000 feet, the fan disk of its {{tail-mounted}} General Electric CF6-6 engine explosively disintegrated. Debris penetrated the tail in numerous places, including the <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer,</b> puncturing the lines of all three hydraulic systems.|$|E
5|$|One change {{made during}} {{production}} was augmented pitch control to avoid deep stall conditions at high angles of attack. The stall issue {{had been raised}} during development, but had originally been discounted. Model tests of the YF-16 conducted by the Langley Research Center revealed a potential problem, but no other laboratory was able to duplicate it. YF-16 flight tests were not sufficient to expose the issue; later flight testing on the FSD aircraft demonstrated {{there was a real}} concern. In response, the areas of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer</b> were increased 25% on the Block 15 aircraft in 1981 and later retrofitted to earlier aircraft. In addition, a manual override switch to disable the <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer</b> flight limiter was prominently placed on the control console, allowing the pilot to regain control of the horizontal stabilizers (which the flight limiters otherwise lock in place) and recover. Besides reducing the risk of deep stalls, the larger horizontal tail also improved stability and permitted faster takeoff rotation.|$|E

50|$|The {{main house}} {{comprises}} two separate buildings linked together on three levels and uses two wings and two <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizers</b> from a Boeing 747-100. The lower house is partially open air and has 18 ft ceilings topped {{with the left}} 747 wing. The upper structure creates the main house and uses the right wing as the main roof and two <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizers</b> as the roofs of the master bedroom and bathroom.|$|R
5|$|In the {{meantime}} the <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer</b> {{of the second}} prototype was strengthened and it resumed flying on 20 July. The pilot complained of excess torque pull to the right so the vertical stabilizer was enlarged by , but this {{was just one of}} numerous problems, and it was not ready to pass State acceptance trials without more development work on the powerplant. However, the second prototype continued flight testing until 12 July 1946 when an engine fire forced an emergency landing and it was damaged beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} {{determined that}} a spar on the front left of the wing separated, quickly followed by the lower rear spar and the connections which attached the outer wing to the center section. The loss of the left wing caused the aircraft to roll left, whereupon the fuselage and the right <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer</b> collided with the separated wing. The initial separation was caused either by a wind gust in excess of operating velocity, or a similar lower-velocity gust after the material had become fatigued.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, a Lockheed L-1011, {{operating}} as Eastern Airlines Flight 935, suffered a similar failure of its tail-mounted number two engine. The shrapnel from that engine inflicted damage {{on all four}} of its hydraulic systems, which were also close together in the tail structure. Fluid was lost {{in three of the}} four systems. The fourth hydraulic system was impacted with shrapnel, but not punctured. The hydraulic pressure remaining in that fourth system enabled the captain to land the plane safely with some limited use of the outboard spoilers, the inboard ailerons, and the <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer,</b> plus differential engine power of the remaining two engines. There were no injuries.|$|E
25|$|Common {{applications}} {{occur in}} auto racing, helicopter <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizers,</b> and aircraft where high lift is essential, such as banner-towing airplanes.|$|R
50|$|Improved Control Surfaces: The YC-134's <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizers</b> {{were given}} {{endplates}} to improve directional stability. This gave the aircraft its distinctive three-tail look.|$|R
5000|$|In {{naturally}} unstable aircraft, the canard surfaces {{may be used}} as {{an active}} part of the artificial stability system, and are sometimes named <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizers.</b>|$|R
5|$|The wing profile {{remained}} {{the same as the}} F-5E, but had modified leading edge extensions (LEX), which improved the maximum lift coefficient of the wing by about 12% with an increase in wing area of only 1.6%. The original aircraft was fairly sluggish in pitch, so the <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer</b> was increased in size by 30% and a new dual-channel fly-by-wire control system was added. Destabilizing the aircraft in pitch and modifying the LEX improved the instantaneous turn rate by 7% to 20°/sec. Sustained turn rate at Mach0.8 and 15,000ft (4,572m) rose to 11.5°/sec, which compared well with the F-16's 12.8°/sec. Supersonic turn rates were 47% higher than those of the F-5E.|$|E
5|$|According to {{aviation}} historian Bill Gunston, on 24 April 1946 {{representatives from}} Mikoyan-Gurevich and the Yakovlev OKB tossed a coin {{to determine which}} aircraft {{would be the first}} Soviet jet to fly. (MiG had brought the I-300, and Yakovlev the Yak-(3)-15.) MiG won and the I-300's first flight lasted six minutes. These early flights revealed problems with the stability of the aircraft and vibration problems with the new articulated heatshield. It was stiffened before the twelfth flight, but that only partially cured the problem. The first aircraft crashed, killing the pilot, during a demonstration in front of high-ranking officials on 11 July when the attachment lugs of the wing leading edge fairings failed and they hit the horizontal stabilizers. The remaining two prototypes began flight testing the following month, but preparations for the 7 November parade commemorating the October Revolution delayed the start of the State acceptance trials until 17 December. Meanwhile, the <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer</b> of the second prototype disintegrated during flight, but the pilot was able to land the aircraft safely. Another such incident happened to the third prototype in February 1947 and forced the tail to be reinforced.|$|E
25|$|Only two {{examples}} were constructed. The first {{was built by}} Bowlus and features an all-flying <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer.</b> The second was built by Frank Kelsey and has a fixed <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer</b> and flaps in addition to spoilers.|$|E
25|$|The Batwing was {{designed}} with an unusually broad chord, thick section cantilevered wing with the <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizers</b> set {{very close to}} the rear of the aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The {{first major}} change in the F-16, the Block 15 {{aircraft}} featured larger <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizers,</b> the addition of two hardpoints to the chin inlet, an improved AN/APG-66(V)2 radar, and increased capacity for the underwing hardpoints. The Block 15 also gained the Have Quick II secure UHF radio. To counter the additional weight of the new hardpoints, the <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizers</b> were enlarged by 30%. Block 15 is the most numerous variant of the F-16, with 983 produced. The last one was delivered in 1996 to Thailand.|$|R

25|$|Like the M-130, the M-156/PS-30 was a four-engined, high-wing {{design with}} the wing mounted atop a pylon {{extension}} of the fuselage (hull). While the M-156/PS-30 retained the same length as its predecessor, its wingspan was {{increased by more than}} 27ft (8.2m) with the addition of flaps for increased control. The M-156/PS-30 also differed from the M-130 by having a <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer</b> mounted atop a pylon {{at the rear of the}} hull, with twin vertical stabilizers and twin rudders located atop the <b>horizontal</b> <b>stabilizer.</b>|$|E

25|$|An {{investigation}} by the USAF determined that the crash was likely caused by an improper stabilizer trim setting.
