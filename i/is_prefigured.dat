5|$|I. Allegro. The opening is dramatic, with a fully voiced forte C minor chord. The voice-leading of {{this passage}} {{outlines}} a chromatic ascent to A-flat – {{this will be}} the first instance of a remarkable degree of chromaticism in the sonata as a whole. The most salient feature of the first theme is the sudden modulatory digression to A-flat major, established by a rushing downward scale initiated by the final achievement of this key in the ascending voice of the minor theme. The exposition shifts from the tonic to the relative major (E-flat major), touching midway upon its parallel minor (E-flat minor), all in accordance with Classical practice. This second theme, a hymn-like E-flat major melody in four-part harmony, greatly contrasts with the first, though its melodic contour <b>is</b> <b>prefigured</b> in the sudden A-flat major departure. Both themes progress somewhat in the style of variations, and are structured with irregular phrase lengths. The development section is highly chromatic, and is texturally and melodically distinct from the exposition. The recapitulation is once again traditional, staying in the tonic and stressing subdominant tonalities (D-flat, the lowered second degree – in the first theme). The coda returns to the material of the development section, but with stable tonality, dying out in a dark series of cadences in low register.|$|E
500|$|Women and women's issues {{dominate}} Mary Shelley's drama—no male characters appear, {{with the}} brief exception of Ascalaphus. However, as Romanticist Marjean Purinton argues, {{there is a}} strong masculine presence in the play even without male characters, suggesting [...] "the ubiquitous presence of patriarchal power in the domestic sphere". Although the myth is fundamentally about rape and male tyranny, Shelley transforms it into a story about female solidarity and community—these women are storytellers and mythmakers who determine their own fate. Ceres's love—a mother's love—challenges the power of the gods. Shelley tells the story almost entirely from Ceres's point of view; [...] "her play elegiacally praises female creativity and fecundity as ‘Leaf, and blade, and bud, and blossom.’" [...] Shelley writes active, rather than passive, roles for Proserpine and Ceres. For example, it is Ceres's anger, not her grief, that brings [...] "winter's blight". However, Proserpine's abduction <b>is</b> <b>prefigured</b> in the story of Arethusa and, as literary scholar Julie Carlson points out, the women can only join together after Proserpine has been abducted.|$|E
500|$|In its operatic context the lament {{takes the}} form of an {{extended}} recitative of more than 70 vocal lines, delivered in five sections divided by choral comments. Some of the wording <b>is</b> <b>prefigured</b> in the immediately preceding scene in which the First Envoy describes Arianna's plight to a sympathetic chorus of fishermen. The lament depicts Arianna's various emotional reactions to her abandonment: sorrow, anger, fear, self-pity, desolation and a sense of futility. Cusick draws attention to the manner in which Monteverdi is able to match in music the [...] "rhetorical and syntactical gestures" [...] in Rinuccini's text. The opening repeated words [...] "Lasciatemi morire" [...] (Let me die) are accompanied by a dominant seventh chord which Ringer describes as [...] "an unforgettable chromatic stab of pain"; Monteverdi {{was one of the first}} users of this musical device. What follows, says Ringer, has a range and depth [...] "comparable to Shakespeare's most searching soliloquies". The words [...] "Lasciatemi morire" [...] are followed by [...] "O Teseo, O Teseo mio" [...] (O Theseus, my Theseus"); the two phrases represent Arianna's contrasting emotions of despair and longing. Throughout the lament indignation and anger are punctuated by tenderness, until the final iteration of [...] "O Teseo", after which a descending line brings the lament to a quiet conclusion.|$|E

6000|$|Despite Spenser's instinctive {{tendency}} to idealize, and his habit of distilling {{out of the}} actual an ethereal essence in which {{very little of the}} possible seems left, yet his mind, as is generally true of great poets, was founded on a solid basis of good-sense. I do not know where to look for a more cogent {{and at the same time}} picturesque confutation of Socialism than in the Second Canto of the Fifth Book. If I apprehend rightly his words and images, there is not only subtile but profound thinking here.

50|$|Significantly or not, Vance portrays each of {{his human}} {{criminal}} 'princes' (the humanoid alien Attel Malagate is the exception) as a frustrated artist, each working out his fantasies in a different medium.

50|$|Process {{theories}} come in four common archetypes. Evolutionary process theories explain {{change in}} a population through variation, selection and retention—much like biological evolution. In a dialectic process theory, “stability and change are explained by reference to {{the balance of power}} between opposing entities” (p. 517). In a teleological process theory, an agent “constructs an envisioned end state, takes action to reach it and monitors the progress” (p. 518). In a lifecycle process theory, “the trajectory to the final end state <b>is</b> <b>prefigured</b> and requires a particular historical sequence of events” (p. 515); that is, change always conforms to the same series of activities, stages, phases, like a caterpillar transforming into a butterfly.|$|E
