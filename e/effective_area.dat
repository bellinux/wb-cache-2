25|$|By {{the time}} of Ruairi's death in 1198, King Henry II of England had invaded Ireland and given the part of it he {{controlled}} to his son John as a Lordship when John was just 10 in 1177. When John succeeded to the English throne in 1199, he remained Lord of Ireland thereby bringing the kingdom of England and the lordship of Ireland into personal union. By the mid-13th century, while the island was nominally ruled by the king of England, from c.1260 the <b>effective</b> <b>area</b> of control began to recede. As various Cambro-Norman noble families died out in the male line, the Gaelic nobility began to reclaim lost territory.

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{appropriate}} {{index of}} prosthesis internal orifice size {{and its effect}} on operative mortality after aortic valve replacement are controversial. We examined the association between several relevant indices and patient size on operative mortality. Indices examined included projected in vivo <b>effective</b> orifice <b>area</b> and geometric orifice area, with patient size defined as body surface area. MethodsA review of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons National Cardiac Database (2000 - 2004) yielded 48, 722 patients who had isolated aortic valve replacement. This analysis is based on the cohort of 42, 310 patients with the 8 most prevalent valve types with manufacturer’s labeled sizes 19 mm through 29 mm. Multivariable logistic regression models were employed {{to determine the effects of}} body surface <b>area,</b> <b>effective</b> orifice <b>area,</b> geometric orifice area, and selected derived indices (eg, effective orifice area/body surface area) on risk-adjusted operative mortality. ResultsIn separate multivariable models, <b>effective</b> orifice <b>area</b> and geometric orifice area were both inversely correlated with operative mortality. However, an unanticipated finding was that with either <b>effective</b> orifice <b>area</b> or geometric orifice area held constant, body surface area was significantly and inversely correlated with operative mortality. When patients were stratified by <b>effective</b> orifice <b>area,</b> geometric orifice area, or manufacturer’s labeled valve size and type, elevations in body surface area were associated with a decrease rather than an increase in operative mortality. ConclusionsProstheses with small geometric orifice <b>area</b> or small <b>effective</b> orifice <b>area</b> are associated with increased operative mortality after isolated aortic valve replacement. Even for valves with small <b>effective</b> orifice <b>area,</b> however, mortality decreases as body surface area increases. With respect to operative mortality, therefore, our results do not support using arbitrary cutoff values of effective orifice area/body surface area to determine the valve to utilize in a given patient...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives: We {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the Doppler assessment of <b>effective</b> orifice <b>area</b> in aortic prosthetic valves. The <b>effective</b> orifice <b>area</b> is a less flow-dependent parameter than Doppler gradients {{that is used to}} assess prosthetic valve function. However, in vivo reference values show a pronounced spread of <b>effective</b> orifice <b>area</b> and smaller orifices than expected compared with the geometric area. Methods: Using Doppler echocardiography, we studied patients who received a bileaflet St Jude Medical valve (n = 75; St Jude Medical, Inc, St Paul, Minn) or a tilting disc Omnicarbon valve (n = 46; MedicalCV, Incorporated, Inver Grove Heights, Minn). The prosthetic valves were also investigated in vitro in a steady-flow model with Doppler and catheter measurements in the different orifices. The <b>effective</b> orifice <b>area</b> was calculated according to the continuity equation. Results: In vivo, there was a wide distribution with the coefficient of variation (SD/mean × 100 %) for different valve sizes ranging from 21 % to 39 % in the St Jude Medical valve and from 25 % to 33 % in the Omnicarbon valve. The differences between geometric orifice <b>area</b> and <b>effective</b> orifice <b>area</b> in vitro were 1. 26 ± 0. 41 cm 2 for St Jude Medical and 1. 17 ± 0. 38 cm 2 for Omnicarbon valves. The overall <b>effective</b> orifice <b>areas</b> and peak catheter gradients were similar: 1. 35 ± 0. 37 cm 2 and 25. 9 ± 16. 1 mm Hg for St Jude Medical and 1. 46 ± 0. 49 cm 2 and 24. 6 ± 17. 7 mm Hg for Omnicarbon. However, in St Jude Medical valves, more pressure was recovered downstream, 11. 6 ± 6. 3 mm Hg versus 3. 4 ± 1. 6 mm Hg in Omnicarbon valves (P =. 0001). Conclusions: In the patients, we found a pronounced spread of <b>effective</b> orifice <b>areas,</b> which can be explained by measurement errors or true biologic variations. The in vitro <b>effective</b> orifice <b>area</b> was small compared with the geometric orifice area, and we suspect that nonuniformity in the spatial velocity profile causes underestimation. The St Jude Medical and Omnicarbon valves showed similar peak catheter gradients and <b>effective</b> orifice <b>areas</b> in vitro, but more pressure was recovered in the St Jude Medical valve. The <b>effective</b> orifice <b>area</b> can therefore be misleading in the assessment of prosthetic valve performance when bileaflet and tilting disc valves are compared.
