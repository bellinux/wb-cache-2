40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a method for}} mapping unknown large scale static environments using a hybrid of topological and metric representations. A global map is formed from a set of local maps for sub-regions of the environments. Each local map contains quantitative environment information used to define a local reference frame. These maps {{are referred to as}} <b>islands</b> <b>of</b> <b>reliability</b> because they are associated with the sub-regions whose local structure is best matched to the sensors we are using. The connectivity <b>of</b> these <b>islands</b> is represented topologically. The key mapping problem we consider is where to place the <b>islands</b> <b>of</b> <b>reliability</b> and to what extent they should cover the environment. This is accomplished by defining the placement criteria in terms of the task to be satisfied and the uncertainties of the mapping agent. Islands are distributed about the environment at areas suitable for extracting metric information relevant to a localization task. 0 RÉSUM...|$|R

The identification, determination and assignment of lexical stress are crucial issues because the perception of stressed syllables can provide non-native speaking teachers <b>islands</b> <b>of</b> <b>reliability</b> where the phonetic information is more prominent.

The syllable stress, extracted from the speech signal, was integrated in the recognition process by means of a previously proposed decoding method. Experiments were conducted for several signal-to-noise ratio conditions and the results show that stress information is robust in the presence of medium to low noise. This was found to be true both when syllable boundary information was used for stress detection and when this information was not available. Furthermore, the obtained relative improvement increased with a decrease in signal quality, indicating that the stressed parts of the signal can be considered <b>islands</b> <b>of</b> <b>reliability...</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} ways {{to employ}} a certain mathematical characterization of similarity, kernel functions, and machine learning techniques building on it to abstract from data-oriented models of language. A prominent task in machine learning and in linguistic modeling is the classification of data items, the recognition of grammatical features. A bit more complex is the modeling of surface-to-surface relations, e. g. in inflectional paradigms. These morphological changes reflect the underlying grammatical features. Traditional rule-based approaches to feature recognition and inflection fail to explain local reg-ularities within the so-called exceptions. Many linguistic domains exhibit <b>islands</b> <b>of</b> <b>reliability</b> (Al-bright 2002) both within classes of exceptions and the regular cases. For its best-studied instance, {{the debate on the}} proper treatment of this phenomenon is known as the past tense debate (see Pinker and Ullman 2002).

40|$|The {{uncertainty}} in the methane (CH 4) source strength of rice fields is among the highest of all sources in the global CH 4 budget. Methods to estimate the source strength of rice fields {{can be divided into}} two scaling categories: bottom-up (upscaling) and top-down (downscaling). A brief review of upscaling and downscaling methodologies is presented. The combination of upscaling and downscaling methodologies is proposed as a potential method to reduce the {{uncertainty in}} the regional CH 4 source strength of rice fields. Some preliminary results based on upscaling and downscaling are presented and the limitations of the approaches are discussed. The first case study focuses on upscaling by using a field-scale model in combination with spatial databases to calculate CH 4 emissions for the <b>island</b> <b>of</b> Java. The <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> upscaling results is limited by the uncertainty in model input parameters such as soil properties and organic carbon management. Because controlling variables such as harvested rice area may change on relatively short time scales, a land use change model (CLUE) was used to quantify the potential land use changes on Java in the period 1994 - 2010. The predicted changes were evaluated using the CH 4 emission model. Temporal scaling by coupling land use change models and emission models is necessary to answer policy-related questions on future greenhouse gas emissions. In a downscaling case study, we investigate if inverse modeling can constrain the emissions from rice fields by testing a standard CH 4 from rice scenario and a low CH 4 from ric...|$|R
