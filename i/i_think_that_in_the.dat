University of Pennsylvania Physiology professor Kevin Foskett {{said in the}} article, [...] "Emily and {{her family}} want research focused on her mutation to be as focused and accelerated as possible. At one level, that sounds a little selfish, until you realize that her type of mutation, a 'nonsense' mutation ... is responsible for disease in many other genetically inherited forms of disease... Emily's story is compelling. [...] If you've met Emily... you cant help but become engaged and energized." [...] Emily said in that piece, [...] "Obviously our prayer and dream {{is to have a}} breakthrough. [...] But we also realize that it might not happen, or it might not happen in time for me. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> worst case scenario, even if it never could help me, there is a peace I get from at least knowing I'm doing everything I can, and it's not for lack of trying." ...|$|E

"If I believed," [...] he went on, [...] "that I {{could carry}} with me across that curious {{boundary}} enough of decency, enough of my present feelings, {{to keep us}} wholly apart, I would be happier.

He wants me to join a society for the suppression of British sports as being barbarous and antipathetic to the intellectual pursuits of an educated man. I would immediately shoot, fish, hunt and go out ratting, if I could hope for the least success. I know I should never shoot anything but the dog and the gamekeepers, and that I should catch every weed in the river; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process of seasons I might jump over a hedge." ...|$|E

[...] "You are a brave man, Simon; and although {{you have done}} much harm to the Jews, yet I know that you will defend Jerusalem, to the end, against the Romans. You need feel no jealousy of me. I aspire to no leadership, or power. I am here only to fight, and six hundred such men as mine {{are not to be}} despised in the day of trial. Should the Romans march away, baffled, before the walls, I, too, shall leave; and you, who remain, can resume your mad struggles, if you will.

In an hour I shall mount and ride down the road to Badajos, and I shall there restore your liberty to you, and permit you to recross the frontier. It would be a thousand pities that so young and gallant an officer should waste, perhaps, some years of his life in an English prison, for the number of prisoners taken in Flanders is so great that it is impossible for the French to find officers to exchange for them. You will understand that, dealing with allies so jealous and susceptible as the Portuguese, I can hardly take the step of releasing you, as it would be at once rumoured that I had been in communication with a French officer, doubtless from some sinister motive.|$|E
6000|$|There came {{a silence}} that I was impelled to end. I began a stiff {{dissertation}} from the hearthrug. [...] "I am going over, because I think I may join in an intellectual renascence on the Conservative side. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coming struggle {{there will be}} a partial and altogether confused and demoralising victory for democracy, that will stir the classes which now dominate the Conservative party into an energetic revival. They will set out to win back, and win back. Even if my estimate of contemporary forces is wrong and they win, they will still be forced to reconstruct their outlook. A war abroad will supply the chastening if home politics fail. The effort at renascence is bound to come by either alternative. I believe I can do more in relation to that effort than in any other connexion in the world of politics at the present time. That's my case, Margaret." ...|$|E

60|$|One of the {{new friends}} who went out there with me was a large man, and I had been admiring his size all the way. I was still admiring it as he stood by the {{governor}} on the veranda, talking; then the Fijian butler stepped out there to announce tea, and dwarfed him. Maybe he did not quite dwarf him, but at any rate the contrast was quite striking. Perhaps that dark giant was a king in a condition of political suspension. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> talk there on the veranda {{it was said that}} in Fiji, as in the Sandwich Islands, native kings and chiefs are of much grander size and build than the commoners. This man was clothed in flowing white vestments, and they were just the thing for him; they comported well with his great stature and his kingly port and dignity. European clothes would have degraded him and made him commonplace. I know that, because they do that with everybody that wears them.|$|E
60|$|It is {{the luxurious}} and {{dissipated}} {{who set the}} fashions which the herd so diligently follow. The traveller who stops at the best houses, so called, soon discovers this, for the publicans presume {{him to be a}} Sardanapalus, and if he resigned himself to their tender mercies he would soon be completely emasculated. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> railroad car we are inclined to spend more on luxury than on safety and convenience, and it threatens without attaining these to become no better than a modern drawing-room, with its divans, and ottomans, and sun-shades, and a hundred other oriental things, which we are taking west with us, invented for the ladies of the harem and the effeminate natives of the Celestial Empire, which Jonathan should be ashamed to know the names of. I would rather sit on a pumpkin and have it all to myself than be crowded on a velvet cushion. I would rather ride on earth in an ox cart, with a free circulation, than go to heaven in the fancy car of an excursion train and breathe a malaria all the way.|$|E
60|$|The {{kind of way}} in which, as {{it seems}} to me, time ought not to enter into our theoretic {{philosophical}} thought, may be illustrated by the philosophy which has become associated with the idea of evolution, and which is exemplified by Nietzsche, pragmatism, and Bergson. This philosophy, {{on the basis of the}} development which has led from the lowest forms of life up to man, sees in progress the fundamental law of the universe, and thus admits the difference between earlier and later into the very citadel of its contemplative outlook. With its past and future history of the world, conjectural as it is, I do not wish to quarrel. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intoxication of a quick success, much that is required for a true understanding of the universe has been forgotten. Something of Hellenism, something, too, of Oriental resignation, must be combined with its hurrying Western self-assertion before it can emerge from the ardour of youth into the mature wisdom of manhood. In spite of its appeals to science, the true scientific philosophy, I think, is something more arduous and more aloof, appealing to less mundane hopes, and requiring a severer discipline for its successful practice.|$|E
40|$|Although {{the main}} {{subject of this}} conference is the {{discussion}} about {{the images of the}} printers’ devices, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> our case of the Printers’ Devices database an introduction and explanation are necessary.

"I {{think they}} will do," [...] Terence said; [...] "they have picked up marvellously since they have been here; and though I should not like to trust them in the plain with Franceschi's cavalry {{sweeping}} down upon them, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> mountain work they can be trusted to make a stand." ...|$|R

60|$|Next {{after these}} {{beautiful}} people <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> multitudinously varied crowd of London I saw no men so splendidly, so brilliantly, so lustrously handsome as {{three of those}} imperial British whose lives are safer, but whose social status is scarcely better than that of our negroes. They were three tall young Hindoos, in native dress, and white- turbaned to their swarthy foreheads, who suddenly filed out of the crowd, looking more mystery from their liquid eyes than they could well have corroborated in word or thought, and bringing to the metropolis of the West the gorgeous and foolish magnificence of the sensuous East. What did they make of the metropolis? Were they conscious, with or without rebellion, of their subjection, their absolute inferiority in the imperial scheme? If looks went for what looks rarely do, except in women, {{they should have been}} the lords of those they met; but as it was they were simply the representatives of one of the suppressed races which, if they joined hands, could girdle the globe under British rule. Somehow they brought the sense of this home to the beholder, as none of the monuments or memorials of England's imperial glory had done, and then, having fulfilled their office, lost themselves in the crowd.|$|E
60|$|Summary of Chapter.--We have in {{this chapter}} {{discussed}} some of the difficulties and objections which may be urged against my theory. Many {{of them are very}} serious; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> discussion light has been thrown on several facts, which on the theory of independent acts of creation are utterly obscure. We have seen that species at any one period are not indefinitely variable, and are not linked together by a multitude of intermediate gradations, partly because the process of natural selection will always be very slow, and will act, at any one time, only on a very few forms; and partly because the very process of natural selection almost implies the continual supplanting and extinction of preceding and intermediate gradations. Closely allied species, now living on a continuous area, must often have been formed when the area was not continuous, and when the conditions of life did not insensibly graduate away from one part to another. When two varieties are formed in two districts of a continuous area, an intermediate variety will often be formed, fitted for an intermediate zone; but from reasons assigned, the intermediate variety will usually exist in lesser numbers than {204} the two forms which it connects; consequently the two latter, during the course of further modification, from existing in greater numbers, will have a great advantage over the less numerous intermediate variety, and will thus generally succeed in supplanting and exterminating it.|$|E
60|$|Evolutionism, in {{one form}} or another, is the {{prevailing}} creed of our time. It dominates our politics, our literature, and not least our philosophy. Nietzsche, pragmatism, Bergson, are phases in its philosophic development, and their popularity far beyond the circles of professional philosophers shows its consonance with the spirit of the age. It believes itself firmly based on science, a liberator of hopes, an inspirer of an invigorating faith in human power, a sure antidote to the ratiocinative authority of the Greeks and the dogmatic authority of mediæval systems. Against so fashionable and so agreeable a creed it may seem useless to raise a protest; and with much of its spirit every modern man must be in sympathy. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intoxication of a quick success, much that is important and vital to a true understanding of the universe has been forgotten. Something of Hellenism must be combined with the new spirit before it can emerge from the ardour of youth into the wisdom of manhood. And it is time to remember that biology is neither the only science, nor yet the model to which all other sciences must adapt themselves. Evolutionism, as I shall try to show, is not a truly scientific philosophy, either in its method or in the problems which it considers. The true scientific philosophy is something more arduous and more aloof, appealing to less mundane hopes, and requiring a severer discipline for its successful practice.|$|E
