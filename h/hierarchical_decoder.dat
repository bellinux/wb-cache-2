40|$|This paper {{describes}} a lattice-based decoder for hierarchical phrase-based translation. The decoder is implemented with standard WFST operations {{as an alternative}} to the well-known cube pruning procedure. We find that the use of WFSTs rather than k-best lists requires less pruning in translation search, resulting in fewer search errors, direct generation of translation lattices in the target language, better parameter optimization, and improved translation performance when rescoring with long-span language models and MBR decoding. We report translation experiments for the Arabic-to-English and Chinese-to-English NIST translation tasks and contrast the WFSTbased <b>hierarchical</b> <b>decoder</b> with hierarchical translation under cube pruning. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{the design of a}} 2 -to- 4 <b>hierarchical</b> <b>decoder,</b> {{designed}} {{with the help of a}} static CMOS logic. The decoders are designed using 180 nm technology parameters and are simulated with PSPICE. The 2 -to- 4 decoders designed are compared with the simulated results on the basis of propagation delay with different branching effort and different load capacitances. The designed decoders are also compared in terms of total power dissipation with different VDD applied. It is found that, a decoder designed by using static CMOS based NAND gates has less propagation delay as compared to the one designed by using static CMOS based NOR gates, this can be verified by theoretical and simulated results. Also, the NAND decoder (3 -stage) tends to have low power as compared to a NOR decoder (2 stage) ...|$|E
40|$|Simulcast or {{simultaneous}} broadcasting of {{a program}} at two different quality or resolution levels requires a less complex source coding than scalable or hierarchical source coding, {{where there is a}} link between base and enhancement layer. In this paper, we will investigate the conditions under which a scalable system has a better subjective quality compared to simulcast at equal bit-rates. 1 Introduction Hierarchical coding represents data in two layers : a base layer and an enhancement layer. A <b>hierarchical</b> <b>decoder</b> has to decode both layers and has therefore a higher complexity than a decoder that decodes just one layer. A transmission with no hierarchical coding link between both layers broadcasts simultaneously the same program at two different bit-rates or quality levels, and is therefore called "simulcast". This simulcast scenario does not require a more complex decoder for the enhancement layer. This contribution discusses pros and cons of simulcast and hierarchical source codin [...] ...|$|E

We use multiple segmentations for the Russian input language. We employ the Hadoop framework to extract rules. The decoder is HiFST, a <b>hierarchical</b> phrase-based <b>decoder</b> implemented using weighted finitestate transducers.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new paradigm}} for translation from inflectionally rich languages {{that was used in}} the University of Maryland statistical machine translation system for the WMT 07 Shared Task. The system is based on a <b>hierarchical</b> phrase-based <b>decoder</b> that has been augmented to translate ambiguous input given {{in the form of a}} confusion network (CN), a weighted finite state representation of a set of strings. By treating morphologically derived forms of the input sequence as possible, albeit more “costly ” paths that the decoder may select, we find that significant gains (10 % BLEU relative) can be attained when translating from Czech, a language with considerable inflectional complexity, into English. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the VLSI realization of an MPEG- 2 conformant <b>hierarchical</b> video <b>decoder</b> {{based on the}} spatially scalable profile at the High- 1440 Level (SSP@H- 14 L). The decoder is built at the Heinrich-Hertz-Institut (HHI) {{as part of the}} ongoing joint R&D project "Hierarchical digital television transmission" (HDTVT) and will be demonstrated during the international exhibition IFA 1995 in Berlin. The project proposes a compatible approach to HDTV (TV-HDTV compatibility due to spatial scalability). Terrestrial broadcasting with graceful degradation and portable reception (through spatial and SNR scalability) are supported besides the less demanding cable and satellite scenarios. Two chips are currently under development to achieve an integrated hardware solution for the hierarchical MPEG- 2 video source decoder. The first chip, BISTRO, incorporates all functions from transport stream reception up to the IDCT. The second chip, MOFA, is performs upconversion, motion compensation, global frame store addressing and digital output of the decoded data. The design concept uses logic synthesis from VHDL. The design is verified through automatic comparison with the results from a high-level MPEG- 2 reference program. An on-board DSP supports board self-test and serves for system monitoring during field trials. The complete <b>hierarchical</b> HDTV video <b>decoder</b> fits on one single PCB...|$|R
40|$|A new Viterbi decoder, {{capable of}} {{decoding}} convolutional codes with constraint lengths up to 15, is under {{development for the}} Deep Space Network (DSN). A key feature of this decoder is a two-level partitioning of the Viterbi state diagram into identical subgraphs. The larger subgraphs correspond to circuit boards, while the smaller subgraphs correspond to Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) chips. The full decoder is built from identical boards, which in turn are built from identical chips. The resulting system is modular and <b>hierarchical.</b> The <b>decoder</b> is easy to implement, test, and repair because it uses a single VLSI chip design and a single board design. The partitioning is completely general {{in the sense that}} an appropriate number of boards or chips may be wired together to implement a Viterbi decoder of any size {{greater than or equal to}} the size of the module...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} the use of pushdown automata (PDA) {{in the context of}} statistical machine translation and alignment under a synchronous context-free grammar. We use PDAs to com-pactly represent the space of candidate translations generated by the grammar when applied to an input sentence. General-purpose PDA algorithms for replacement, composition, shortest path, and expansion are presented. We describe HiPDT, a <b>hierarchical</b> phrase-based <b>decoder</b> using the PDA representation and these algorithms. We contrast the complexity of this decoder with a de-coder based on a finite state automata representation, showing that PDAs provide a more suitable framework to achieve exact decoding for larger synchronous context-free grammars and smaller language models. We assess this experimentally on a large-scale Chinese-to-English alignment and translation task. In translation, we propose a two-pass decoding strategy involving a weaker language model in the first-pass to address the results of PDA complexity analysis. We study in depth the experimental conditions and tradeoffs in which HiPDT can achieve state-of-the-art performance for large-scale SMT...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Existing video {{distortion}} models {{used for}} hybrid video codecs {{do not match}} the hierarchical prediction structure employed in SVC. In this paper, we derive a new video distortion model that captures the sensitivity to frame losses of a <b>hierarchical</b> prediction video <b>decoder</b> using the Picture Copy (PC) concealment strategy of SVC. Existing frameworks only cover non-scalable coders, and therefore, fall short of accurately modeling scalable coders due to the additional parameters that come into play. Performance evaluations show that our model closely approximates the loss-distortion of hierarchical coders for video sequences with different levels of motion, with exceptional performance in sequences with homogeneous levels of motion...|$|R
