40|$|The purpose {{with this}} study is to explore how {{teachers}} in Early Childhood Education programs(ECE) in Sweden describe and relate to the <b>first</b> <b>meetings</b> with migrant children and theirfamilies. The research questions are; how do teachers describe the <b>first</b> <b>meetings</b> with themigrant children and their families? and what kind of difficulties can we distinguish from theteachers’ descriptions? Our essay will answer these questions by analyzing data gatheredthrough a focus group of four teachers. This study has a qualitative approach and the teachersdescriptions are interpreted and analyzed with a postmodern and socially constructive view oninteraction and meeting the Other. The results show that the <b>first</b> <b>meetings</b> with the immigrant families contain information andquestions of a practical nature. The results also show difficulties during these <b>first</b> <b>meetings</b> andthe continuous work with the migrant children and their families due to language barriers. Twothemes are also noticeable in our results: the teachers ambition and dedication and the teachersfeelings of being insufficient. In conclusion our results show that it’s not always easy workingwith immigrant families. Some of the contributing factors to this are inadequate resources, thelack of time and the large groups of children in the Swedish ECE programs.

5|$|During 1977 the World Meteorological Organization {{decided to}} form a {{hurricane}} committee, which held its <b>first</b> <b>meeting</b> during May 1978 and {{took control of the}} Atlantic hurricane naming lists. During 1978 the Secretary of Commerce Juanita Kreps ordered NOAA administrator Robert White to cease the sole usage of female names for hurricanes. Robert White subsequently passed the order on to the Director of NHC Neil Frank, who attended the <b>first</b> <b>meeting</b> of the hurricane committee and requested that both men’s and women’s names be used for the Atlantic. The committee subsequently decided to accept the proposal and adopted five new lists of male and female names to be used the following year. The lists also contained several Spanish and French names, so that they could reflect the cultures and languages used within the Atlantic Ocean. After an agreement was reached between Mexico and the United States, six new sets of male/female names were implemented for the Eastern Pacific basin during 1978. A new list was also drawn up during the year for the Western Pacific and was implemented after Typhoon Bess and the 1979 tropical cyclone conference.|$|E
