5|$|There are {{two types}} of geysers: {{fountain}} geysers which erupt from pools of water, typically in a series of intense, even violent, bursts; and cone geysers which erupt from cones or mounds of siliceous sinter (including geyserite), usually in steady jets that last anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes. Old Faithful, perhaps the best-known geyser at Yellowstone National Park, <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cone geyser. Grand Geyser, the tallest predictable geyser on earth, (although Geysir in Iceland is taller, it is not predictable), also at Yellowstone National Park, <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fountain geyser.|$|E
5|$|An old {{qualitative}} {{test for}} the presence of the alkene functional group is that alkenes turn brown aqueous bromine solutions colourless, forming a bromohydrin with some of the dibromoalkane also produced. The reaction passes through a short-lived strongly electrophilic bromonium intermediate. This <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> halogen addition reaction.|$|E

5|$|Trillium grandiflorum is {{most common}} in rich, mixed upland forests. It is easily {{recognised}} by its attractive three-petaled white flowers, opening from late spring to early summer, that rise above a whorl of three, leaf-like bracts. It <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> spring ephemeral, a plant whose life-cycle is synchronised {{with that of the}} deciduous woodland which it favours.|$|E
5|$|A villanelle (also {{known as}} villanesque) is a nineteen-line poetic form {{consisting}} of five tercets {{followed by a}} quatrain. There are two refrains and two repeating rhymes, with {{the first and third}} line of the first tercet repeated alternately until the last stanza, which includes both repeated lines. The villanelle <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fixed verse form. The word derives from Latin, then Italian, and is related to the initial subject of the form being the pastoral.|$|E
5|$|An acid {{dissociation}} constant, Ka, (also {{known as}} acidity constant, or acid-ionization constant) is a quantitative {{measure of the}} strength of an acid in solution. It is the equilibrium constant for a chemical reaction known as dissociation in the context of acid–base reactions. and the constants for dissociation of successive protons as Ka2, etc. Phosphoric acid, H3PO4, <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> polyprotic acid as it can lose three protons.|$|E

The employee pension fund, created by the State of Maryland to provide retirement benefits for its employees, <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fiduciary fund. Financial statements may further distinguish fiduciary funds as either trust or agency funds; a trust fund generally exists {{for a longer period of}} time than an agency fund.|$|E
5|$|In mathematics, the curve-shortening flow is {{a process}} that modifies a smooth curve in the Euclidean plane by moving its points perpendicularly to the curve at a speed {{proportional}} to the curvature. The curve-shortening flow <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> geometric flow, and is the one-dimensional case of the mean curvature flow. Other names for the same process include the Euclidean shortening flow, geometric heat flow, and arc length evolution.|$|E
5|$|Laminar {{boundary}} layers can be loosely classified {{according to}} their structure and {{the circumstances under which}} they are created. The thin shear layer which develops on an oscillating body <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Stokes boundary layer, while the Blasius boundary layer refers to the well-known similarity solution near an attached flat plate held in an oncoming unidirectional flow and Falkner–Skan boundary layer, a generalization of Blasius profile. When a fluid rotates and viscous forces are balanced by the Coriolis effect (rather than convective inertia), an Ekman layer forms. In the theory of heat transfer, a thermal boundary layer occurs. A surface can have multiple types of boundary layer simultaneously.|$|E

50|$|In some plants, {{pollination}} {{or another}} stimulation {{is required for}} parthenocarpy. This is termed stimulative parthenocarpy. Plants {{that do not require}} pollination or other stimulation to produce parthenocarpic fruit have vegetative parthenocarpy. Seedless cucumbers <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> vegetative parthenocarpy, seedfull watermelon <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> stenospermocarpy.|$|R

5|$|The University of Dayton South Student Neighborhood (formerly and colloquially Ghetto) is a {{neighborhood}} in Dayton, Ohio, that {{is home to}} upperclassmen at the University of Dayton (UD). It <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> form of housing called a student ghetto. Houses in the neighborhood are leased to students, an arrangement that resembles both traditional university housing and a landlord/tenant relationship. The neighborhood is also known as the South Student Neighborhood, a term commonly used by the university.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebellum}} modulates {{the outputs}} of other brain systems, whether motor related or thought related, {{to make them}} certain and precise. Removal of the cerebellum does not prevent an animal from doing anything in particular, but it makes actions hesitant and clumsy. This precision is not built-in, but learned by trial and error. The muscle coordination learned while riding a bicycle <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> type of neural plasticity that may take place largely within the cerebellum. 10% of the brain's total volume consists of the cerebellum and 50% of all neurons are held within its structure.|$|E
5|$|The genus Gymnogyps <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> relict distribution. During the Pleistocene epoch, this genus was {{widespread}} across the Americas. From fossils, the Floridan Gymnogyps kofordi from the Early Pleistocene and the Peruvian Gymnogyps howardae from the Late Pleistocene have been described. A condor found in Late Pleistocene deposits on Cuba was initially described as Antillovultur varonai, but {{has since been}} recognized as another member of Gymnogyps, Gymnogyps varonai. It may even have derived from a founder population of California condors.|$|E

5|$|The helmet <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> three-piece Roman {{ceremonial}} cavalry helmet, made of {{sheet iron}} covered with silver sheet and partly decorated with gold leaf. Such helmets were worn by Roman auxiliary cavalrymen in displays known as hippika gymnasia {{and may also}} have been worn in battle, despite their relative thinness and lavish decoration. Horses and riders wore lavishly decorated clothes, armour and plumes while performing feats of horsemanship and re-enacting historical and legendary battles, such as the wars of the Greeks and Trojans.|$|E
5|$|This breed, {{along with}} other brachycephalic dogs (e.g., boxers, bulldogs), are also prone to hemivertebrae. The curled tail of a British bulldog <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hemivertebrae, but when it occurs not in the {{coccygeal}} vertebrae but {{in other areas of}} the spine, it can cause paralysis. The condition occurs when two parts of a spinal vertebra do not fuse properly while a young Pug is still growing, resulting in an irregularly shaped spinal cavity which can put pressure on the spinal cord.|$|E
5|$|Every Deshastha {{family has}} their own family patron deity or the Kuladaivat. This deity is common to a lineage or a clan of several {{families}} who are connected to each other through a common ancestor. The Khandoba of Jejuri <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Kuladaivat of some Maharashtrian Deshastha families; he is a common Kuladaivat to several castes ranging from Brahmins to Dalits. The practice of worshiping local or territorial deities as Kuladaivats began {{in the period of}} the Yadava dynasty. Other family deities of the people of Maharashtra are Bhavani of Tuljapur, Mahalaxmi of Kolhapur, Mahalaxmi of Amravati, Renuka of Mahur, Parashuram in Konkan, Saptashringi on Saptashringa hill at Vani in Nasik district. Despite being the most popular deity amongst Deshastha and other Marathi people, very few families regard Vitthal or other popular Avatars of Vishnu such as Rama or Krishna as their Kuldaivat, with Balaji being an exception.|$|E
