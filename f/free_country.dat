5|$|The {{right to}} vote in Singapore is not {{explicitly}} stated in Singapore's Constitution, but the Government has expressed the view {{that it may be}} inferred from the fact that Singapore is a representative democracy and from specific constitutional provisions, including Articles 65 and 66 which set out requirements for the prorogation and dissolution of Parliament and the holding of general elections. Speaking on the matter in Parliament in 2009, the Minister for Law, K. Shanmugam, said that the {{right to vote}} could not be a mere privilege as this would imply the existence of an institution superior to the body of citizens that is empowered to grant such a privilege, but that no such institution exists in a <b>free</b> <b>country.</b> In 1966 a Constitutional Commission chaired by Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin advocated entrenching the right to vote within the Constitution, but this was not taken up by the Parliament of the day. When this proposal was repeated during the 2009 parliamentary debate, the Government took the view that such entrenchment was unnecessary.|$|E

Even at this time, he emphasised that, in the event of war, India's place was alongside the democracies, though he insisted that India could only fight in support of Great Britain and France as a <b>free</b> <b>country.</b>|$|E

The poorest 10 percent of the {{population}} have an average income of just $728 in the least <b>free</b> <b>countries</b> compared with over $7,000 in the most <b>free</b> <b>countries.</b> The life expectancy of {{people living in}} the most free nations is 20 years longer than for people in the least <b>free</b> <b>countries.</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{extent of}} {{political}} and personal freedom in respondents’ countries of origin was determined based on the country rankings from the Freedom in the World, a survey created by Gastil (1980) and published by the Freedom House. The countries were ranked by political rights and civil liberties as free (Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia), partly free (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Moldova, and Ukraine), or unfree (Belarus and Russia). These rankings were used to create three dummy variables: (1) <b>free</b> <b>countries</b> (<b>free</b> countries[*]=[*] 1, used as a reference category); (2) partly <b>free</b> <b>countries</b> (partly <b>free</b> countries[*]=[*] 1); and (3) unfree countries (unfree countries[*]=[*] 1).|$|R
25|$|His sister Elena Krylenko {{worked for}} Maxim Litvinov in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs (although {{she was never}} {{a member of the}} Party); in 1924 she decided to leave Russia with the American writer Max Eastman (who had been in Russia for almost two years, researching and writing a life of Trotsky). To enable her to leave, Litvinov agreed to pass her off as a member of his {{delegation}} when he travelled to London for an international conference. But she could not leave the delegation and remain in a <b>free</b> <b>country</b> without a passport, which the Bolsheviks would not give her. So, in the hours before their train left, she and Max Eastman got married. They were still married and living in America when she died in 1956. Thus she escaped the purges.|$|E
25|$|The {{short-lived}} Corsican Republic (1755–1769) was {{the first}} country to grant limited universal suffrage to all citizens {{over the age of}} 25. This was followed by other experiments in the Paris Commune of 1871 and the island republic of Franceville (1889). The 1840 constitution of the Kingdom of Hawai'i granted universal suffrage to all male and female adults. In 1893, when the Kingdom of Hawai'i was overthrown in a coup, New Zealand became the only independent country to practice universal (active) suffrage, and the Freedom in the World index lists New Zealand as the only <b>free</b> <b>country</b> in the world in 1893. In 1906, Finland became the second country in the world, and the first in Europe, to grant universal active suffrage to its citizens and the first in the world to grant universal full suffrage (active and passive suffrage) by being the first country in the world to grant women full political rights. So Finland {{was the first}} country in the world to give all (adult) citizens full suffrage, in other words the right to vote and to run for office (in 1906). New Zealand was the first country in the world to grant all (adult) citizens the right to vote (in 1893), but women did not get the right to run for the New Zealand legislature until 1919.|$|E

30|$|This finding refines and {{complicates the}} {{environmental}} justice literature that holds that marginal groups in poor, nondemocratic countries {{are the most}} vulnerable to violent repression (Adeola 2000; Salehyan et al. 2012). Our findings support the vulnerability of marginalized groups in poor and nondemocratic countries—three of the four cases where death tolls exceeded one hundred people occurred in nondemocratic countries; all of them related to extractive industries funded with international funding. However, our findings also suggest that violence against marginal groups engaging in environmental protests {{is a very serious}} problem for all countries, irrespective of political regime type. While only one-third of the cases of violence in nondemocratic countries involved marginalized groups (6 of 18 cases), 63  % of violence in <b>free</b> <b>countries</b> involved marginalized groups (17 of 27 cases), and 76  % of violence in partly <b>free</b> <b>countries</b> involved marginalized groups (Fig.  5).|$|R
40|$|My work {{contributes}} to current {{explanations of the}} variance in financial development across countries by considering the role of political and legal structure in determining the effect of private interests on financial policy and illustrating the political obstacles that policymakers face when reforming the financial system. In Chapter 2, I present a political economy model to study the role of politics in the process of financial development across emerging markets. The model concludes that both special interest groups and political structure affect the level of credit market development chosen in equilibrium. When policymakers are constrained by political institutions that require democratic accountability, {{they are more likely to}} improve the level of creditor rights enforcement in the financial system. Financial reform is also more likely to occur in wealthy and highly productive economies. In contrast, the model shows that openness to international capital inflows impedes financial development. Furthermore elite special interest group members benefit more from financial repression when wealth is unequally distributed; hence, income inequality provides a further obstacle to financial reform in emerging markets. Chapter 3 empirically investigates the role of political institutions in implementing financial reform under three different levels of democratic accountability, <b>Free</b> <b>Countries,</b> Partly <b>Free</b> <b>Countries</b> and Not <b>Free</b> <b>Countries.</b> I find that the institutional details of the political system, as summarized by the number and cohesion of its veto players - individuals whose consent is required for policy change - are weakly associated with credit market development in Partly <b>Free</b> <b>Countries.</b> Chapter 4 (co-authored with A. Knill) investigates the role of security laws on the ability of firms to raise external finance by issuing capital. We find that securities laws have disparate effects on capital issuance between small and large firms in G 10 and emerging market countries. Private enforcement of securities laws that codify existing market arrangements is found to be a deterrent to capital issuance for small firms and firms in emerging markets. Public enforcement of securities laws by government regulation significantly increases the probability of issuance for emerging market firms...|$|R
