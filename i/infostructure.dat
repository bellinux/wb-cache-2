Network-centric operations are postulated to offer information advantages that include significantly improved capabilities for accessing and sharing information. These improved capabilities will be dependent on emergent technologies, new processes, and novel ways of organizing to enable operators to leverage the anticipated information advantage and reap the full benefits afforded by a distributed, networked organization. New variables and metrics to assess these benefits are currently under development.

It appears sufficiently generic an expression to encompass any computer-based warfighting system. It is true {{that there is no}} dictionary definition of the term. This calls for a clarification of the sense it will have in this article: NCW is about leveraging existing information assets using an <b>infostructure.</b> Now, let us dissect this statement: The term <b>infostructure</b> is an amalgamation of the words information and infrastructure – it refers to the infrastructure used for information sharing. This could be anything from a long-wave military radio network to an office Local Area Network (LAN). The next keyphrase is existing information assets. This establishes that NCW is not about creating new information, but rather about using the information that is already in our possession. Finally, the word leveraging is of crucial importance: We are trying to make better use of what we already have. Based on these premises, NCW is about creating battlespace superiority through more efficient use of existing information. The concept of NCW can be further illustrated by an example. Think of a situation where Army tanks, Navy ships carrying short-range missiles, and Air Force ground attack aircraft would be deployed to take out a mobile enemy command unit. Rather than each moving independently toward the target, they would use a common data network to coordinate their efforts. Each unit type has various sensors to track the target, and this data is fed into the data network. The data is processed into one single target reading that is returned to the units, rendering much more accurate positioning. As the units move in closer to the target, they all have the friendly tank positions plotted on their map displays to avoid friendly fire incidents. The Navy ships have real-time information on the location of the attack aircraft as the ships get ready to launch their missiles. Finally, when weapons are launched, all unit...|$|E

With the strength of the electronic industry cluster since the late 1980 s, where a large portion was generated by American, Japanese, and Taiwanese multi-national companies, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) linked with the electronic industry was developed through the Multimedia Super Corridor programme (MSC).

In the Ninth Malaysian Plan (2006 - 2010), better known as the RMK- 9, much effort is being and will be taken by the government in preparing a more secure platform to enable the country to easily shift toward K-economy and K-Malaysia. Since ICT happens to be a main factor in the process of K-economic development and a K-Malaysia, efforts have been and will be increased by the government to streamline the access to ICT services and facilities that is more encompassing in all aspects of daily life. The development of human capital toward K-labour is also a critical aspect under the RMK- 9 for bridging the digital divide through access to ICT services and facilities. Therefore, ICT training programmes and education is currently and will be augmented and broadened to schools, pre-universities, and institutions of higher education.

Usability is the human factor that encompasses the ethical, educational, and evaluative aspects of design.
