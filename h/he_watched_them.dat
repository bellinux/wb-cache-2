5|$|Sources {{indicate}} that executive producer Steve Jobs lacked {{confidence in the}} film during its production, {{and he had been}} talking to various companies, ranging from Hallmark to Microsoft, about selling Pixar. However, as the film progressed, Jobs became ever more excited about it, feeling that he might {{be on the verge of}} transforming the movie industry. As scenes from the movie were finished, <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them</b> repeatedly and had friends come by his home to share his new passion. Jobs decided that the release of Toy Story that November would be the occasion to take Pixar public. A test audience near Anaheim in late July 1995 indicated the need for last-minute tweaks, which added further pressure to the already frenetic final weeks. Response cards from the audience were encouraging, but were not top of the scale, adding further question as to how audiences would respond. The film ended with a shot of Andy's house and the sound of a new puppy. Michael Eisner, who attended the screening, told Lasseter afterward that the film needed to end with a shot of Woody and Buzz together, reacting to the news of the puppy.|$|E
60|$|The {{passengers}} all {{joined in}} the cry for aid. The man smiled malignantly as <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them</b> drive off, {{and then}} took a seat on a baulk of timber till Mike returned.|$|E
60|$|And so <b>he</b> sat <b>watching</b> <b>them</b> {{until they}} had {{disappeared}} in the forest toward the castle of Colfax.|$|R
60|$|Arnold {{glanced over}} his shoulder. Rosario was still {{standing}} in the same place, but <b>he</b> was <b>watching</b> <b>them</b> intently.|$|R
50|$|The locathah and merfolk {{believe their}} deity washes their gills with the Water of Life before {{dropping}} {{them into the}} Current of Existence. Eadro is aloof from other races, caring only about the merfolk and locathah <b>he</b> created. <b>He</b> <b>watches</b> <b>them</b> carefully, knowing the potential for conflict between them. He also keeps {{his eye on the}} races of evil that threaten them from without.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them</b> keenly. Hamel, {{though he}} {{scarcely}} understood, {{was quick to}} appreciate the possible significance of that tentative question.|$|E
6000|$|... "Couldn't we light a {{fire with}} a fire-fly?" [...] asked Rob, hopefully, as <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them</b> flitting to and fro like winged sparks.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them</b> eating, drinking, laughing, talking, [...] Busy with {{finger and}} spoon, [...] While three most cunning Fiddlers, clad in crimson, [...] Played them a supper-tune.|$|E
60|$|Urmston {{crossed the}} room as he was bidden, for which one could {{scarcely}} blame him, and the man sat down where <b>he</b> could <b>watch</b> <b>them</b> both.|$|R
25|$|Parnassus emerges years later, finding Valentina {{is married}} to Anton {{and they have a}} daughter. <b>He</b> <b>watches</b> <b>them</b> from outside a {{restaurant}} window, but when tempted to join them, he is stopped by Percy. Teaming up once more, Parnassus and Percy sell toy theatre replicas of the Imaginarium and the troupe on a street corner. Mr. Nick invites Parnassus over to him, but Percy puts an end to the temptation.|$|R
60|$|Heckewelder {{opened the}} door. Evidently <b>he</b> had <b>watched</b> for <b>them.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Take {{yourself}} to hell, sir!" [...] answered Kenneth, {{turning his back}} upon him. The ghost of an evil smile played round Joseph Ashburn's lips as <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them</b> up {{the road}} and then, with a mysterious grin, turned into the Jack Ashore, and taking {{a seat in the}} bar waited patiently for their return.|$|E
6000|$|... "See," [...] said Tell, as <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them,</b> [...] "in {{years to}} come, when these same {{children}} are gray-haired, they will remember this night as freshly {{as they will}} remember it to-morrow." ...|$|E
50|$|Scene 2: Joan and Todd {{learn more}} about each other {{including}} a discussion about their current hat designs. Todd brings up a hypothesis that the way the company gets contracts is corrupt, claiming {{there is a certain}} person's brother-in-law that is involved. Joan wants to know more, but Todd doesn't {{want to talk about it}} at work. Joan changes the topic to not liking to watch the trials at night. Todd says <b>he</b> <b>watches</b> <b>them</b> every night.|$|R
5000|$|Hazlik is {{described}} as having [...] "no interest {{in the politics of}} his own people, instead concentrating on his magical research." [...] By and large he entrusts the rule of his land to satraps who are left in no doubt whatsoever of the horrible fate that awaits them on experimentation tables should they displease him. It is not clear how carefully <b>he</b> <b>watches</b> <b>them,</b> although <b>he</b> does at least make nominal efforts to appear to be paying attention.|$|R
5000|$|The next day, {{the ladder}} from the {{crawlspace}} descends into view, and the house's previous owner Aldon Webber (Steven Weber) climbs down. He washes up and helps himself to some food, and he retrieves a stuffed unicorn that Kayla had thrown out. Webber's intrusions into the Gates' lives grow more elaborate and sinister as the film progresses. <b>He</b> <b>watches</b> <b>them</b> closely through the air vents, and he even creeps into Kayla's room one night to film her sleeping.|$|R
60|$|A {{horde of}} tiny black dots raced across the sky, coming rapidly closer. Presently they veered {{to the right}} and disappeared. More planes, {{wingless}} metal planes. <b>He</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them</b> go, driving slowly on.|$|E
60|$|Mannering {{turned his}} head. A little {{rustling}} wind had stolen in from seaward. Above their heads flights of sea-gulls were floating out towards the creeks. <b>He</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them</b> idly until they dropped down.|$|E
60|$|No {{one spoke}} till the butler left the room. Alec {{occupied}} himself idly in making smoke rings, and <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them</b> rise into the air. When {{they were alone}} he turned slowly to Boulger.|$|E
50|$|Everyone {{goes inside}} the room only {{to have all the}} doors and windows locked by Nathan, who has {{complete}} control over the house as <b>he</b> <b>watches</b> <b>them</b> from one of many cameras installed in the house. A door near Ami opens and she runs for escape but before Skye and the others could get out, the door locks behind Ami. As she calls the cops, the police think she is making a prank call. She trips and her phone falls underneath a table.|$|R
50|$|On 10 November 2014, Howard Stern said on {{his radio}} {{show that he was}} a fan of the band. <b>He</b> had <b>watched</b> <b>them</b> on a MTV Awards Show and was {{impressed}} at the sound coming from only a two-piece band.|$|R
60|$|Chris made no answer, <b>he</b> was <b>watching</b> <b>them</b> intently. They stopped {{near the}} bank of the river close to the bridge. Then some of them set to work to level a space of ground, while others made holes at the corners.|$|R
6000|$|... "That Shiner's too fond of her," [...] {{the young}} man said to himself as <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them.</b> They came to the top again, Fancy smiling warmly towards her partner, and went to their places.|$|E
60|$|The three {{children}} were standing {{around in a}} circle, operating the inter-system vidsender. <b>He</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them</b> for a few minutes. None of them {{looked up from the}} small box. They were intent, absorbed in what they were doing.|$|E
6000|$|So in the cheery {{blaze of}} the rekindled fire, Bess and Walter broke their long fast, and never saw how eagerly Jamie {{gathered}} up the scattered crumbs, nor heard him murmur softly, as <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them</b> with loving eyes,-- ...|$|E
60|$|Gilligren {{sat down}} upon a stone where <b>he</b> could <b>watch</b> <b>them,</b> and laying the sack {{at his feet}} was soon deeply {{interested}} in the strange sight. Presently a servant in the King's livery saw him and came to his side.|$|R
5000|$|After {{capturing}} {{prisoners of}} war, he ordered his soldiers to march the prisoners {{along the river}}sides and crammed them into cages that were tied along the river banks. When the high tides came in at dusk, <b>he</b> would <b>watch</b> <b>them</b> drown slowly.|$|R
40|$|Photograph is of {{two women}} {{standing}} as they put pins on the shoulder straps of his military uniform as <b>he</b> <b>watches</b> <b>them.</b> Caption: "Joe Bryan Ferrell, son of Mr. and Mrs. Forrest S. Ferrell, 3505 Marilyn Dr. dons his new gold bars {{with the assistance of}} his best girls, Penny Duncan, a WAF from New York stationed at Tinker air force base, and his mother. Ferrell received his commission as a second lieutenant in the air force at mid year military convocation at Oklahoma A&M. Ferrell was commander of the entire cadet division during the 1955 - 56 Autumn term. ...|$|R
60|$|Alton slowly drew a {{strip of}} hide from beneath him, and passed it across. Seaforth and Okanagan bent over it together, their faces showing intent {{in the light of}} the fire, while Alton laughed softly as <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them</b> {{while they}} murmured together. They were active, wiry fellows, obedient as a rule, but liable to passionate outbreaks, {{like most of}} their mixed race. Now they looked drunkenly determined, and he knew the {{strength}} of his fireman, Pepe.|$|E
6000|$|During {{this part}} of the day these loving couples, whose devotion was so patent to the whole world, were by far the most {{absorbing}} to Stephen. <b>He</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them</b> having their fortunes told, the young women blushing and crying, [...] "Say!" [...] and [...] "Ain't he wicked?" [...] and the young men getting their ears boxed for certain remarks. <b>He</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them</b> standing open-mouthed at the booths and side shows with hands still locked, or again they were chewing cream candy in unison. Or he glanced sidewise at them, seated in the open places with the world so far below them that even the insistent sound of the fifes and drums rose but faintly to their ears.|$|E
60|$|And {{all this}} means {{work for the}} men. Taking Mr. Pike's judgment, they are very inadequate, though by this time they know the ropes. He growls and grumbles, and snorts and sneers {{whenever}} <b>he</b> <b>watches</b> <b>them</b> doing anything. To-day, at eleven in the morning, the wind was so violent, continuing in greater gusts after having come in a great gust, that Mr. Pike ordered the mainsail taken off. The great crojack was already off. But the watch could not clew up the mainsail, and, after much vain sing- songing and pull-hauling, the watch below was routed out to bear a hand.|$|R
60|$|In the {{meantime}} the lion had approached with quiet dignity to within ten paces {{of the two}} men, where <b>he</b> stood curiously <b>watching</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 20. And the marsh-meteors, like tame beasts, {{at night}} Came licking with blue tongues his veined feet; And <b>he</b> would <b>watch</b> <b>them,</b> as, like spirits bright, In many {{entangled}} figures quaint and sweet [...] 115 To some enchanted music they would dance-- Until they vanished {{at the first}} moon-glance.|$|R
