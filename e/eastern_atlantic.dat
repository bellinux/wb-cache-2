5|$|Analysis of {{mitochondrial}} DNA {{has also}} revealed two distinct lineages within this species, one occupying the western Atlantic {{and the other}} occupying the <b>eastern</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> Indian, and Pacific Oceans. This suggests that Indo-Pacific blacktip sharks are descended {{from those in the}} <b>eastern</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> while the western Atlantic sharks became isolated by the widening Atlantic Ocean {{on one side and the}} formation of the Isthmus of Panama on the other. Blacktip sharks from these two regions differ in morphology, coloration, and life history characteristics, and the <b>eastern</b> <b>Atlantic</b> lineage may merit species status. Fossil teeth belonging to this species have been found in Early Miocene (2316 Ma) deposits in Delaware and Florida.|$|E

5|$|The {{milk shark}} has the widest {{distribution}} of any Rhizoprionodon species. In the <b>eastern</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean, {{it is found}} from Mauritania to Angola, as well as around Madeira and in the Gulf of Taranto off southern Italy. In the Indian Ocean, it occurs from South Africa and Madagascar northward to the Arabian Peninsula, and eastward to South and Southeast Asia. In the Pacific Ocean, this species occurs from China and southern Japan, through the Philippines and Indonesia, to New Guinea and northern Australia. The milk shark likely once had a contiguous distribution {{by way of the}} Tethys Sea, until during the Miocene epoch, when <b>eastern</b> <b>Atlantic</b> sharks were isolated from Indo-Pacific sharks by the collision of Asia and Africa.|$|E
50|$|Palinurus mauritanicus {{has been}} less the {{preferred}} target of lobster fisheries because of its relative scarcity, due to its deeper distribution. Its main fishing range is in the <b>eastern</b> central <b>Atlantic</b> off Mauritania. Its high unit value has led to depletion in the <b>eastern</b> central <b>Atlantic.</b>|$|R

40|$|Taxonomic {{revision}} and re-evaluation of the <b>eastern</b> North <b>Atlantic</b> deep-sea ostracods {{are conducted}} based on late Quaternary sediments from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Hole 982 A, Rockall Plateau, <b>eastern</b> North <b>Atlantic.</b> Twenty-one genera and 51 species were examined and (re-) illustrated with high-resolution {{scanning electron microscopy}} images. Six new species are described: Polycope lunaris, Argilloecia labri, Bythoceratina nuda, Cytheropteron colesoabyssorum, Cytheropteron colesopunctatum and Cytheropteron paramediotumidum. Excellent fossil ostracod preservation in this sediment core enabled us to provide a robust taxonomic baseline of the <b>eastern</b> North <b>Atlantic</b> deep-sea ostracods for application to palaeoceanographical, palaeoecological and biogeographical studies. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
5|$|Scyllarus latus {{is found}} along {{most of the}} coast of the Mediterranean Sea (one {{exception}} being the northern Adriatic Sea), and in parts of the <b>eastern</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean from near Lisbon in Portugal south to Senegal, including the islands of Madeira, the Azores, the Selvagens Islands and the Cape Verde Islands. In Senegal, it occurs together with a related species Scyllarides herklotsii, which it closely resembles.|$|E
5|$|The {{only other}} species of Scyllarides {{to occur in the}} <b>Eastern</b> <b>Atlantic</b> is Scyllarides herklotsii, which differs from S.latus mostly in the {{ornamentation}} on the carapace; while in S.latus the tubercles (lumps projecting from the surface) are high and pronounced, they are lower and more rounded in S.herklotsii.|$|E
5|$|Handkea utriformis is widespread, and {{frequent}} in northern temperate zones. It {{is found in}} Europe, continental Asia, Japan, <b>eastern</b> <b>atlantic</b> North America, Mexico, and South Africa. It has also been collected in Chile, and New Zealand. Growing alone or in small groups, it favors sandy open pastures, or heaths, and is often found in coastal regions. It typically fruits in summer through late autumn (July - November in the UK).|$|E
40|$|Here {{we present}} {{evidence}} that the Holocene African monsoon system (AMS) varied {{in response to the}} <b>eastern</b> equatorial <b>Atlantic</b> sea-surface temperature (SST). Several short-term episodes of decreased moisture availability as a result of low <b>eastern</b> equatorial <b>Atlantic</b> SST are suggested by planktonic foraminiferal Mg/Ca ratios. These episodes promoted a weakening of the AMS and thus determined the timing and intensity of arid periods. Local sea-surface salinities also reveal regional patterns of precipitation in equatorial western Africa. The high <b>eastern</b> equatorial <b>Atlantic</b> SSTs occur in concert with seasonally increased insolation at low latitudes, suggesting a strong response of African monsoonal precipitation to oceanic conditions at low latitudes...|$|R

5|$|Ships in the <b>eastern</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean {{suggested}} that a tropical storm was present on October28 with peak winds of 50mph (85km/h). It was estimated to have originated the previous day. The small storm moved to the northwest and later west into an area of sparse observations, suggesting a weaker system. The system's track ended on October29 due to uncertainty, but it was estimated to have dissipated soon after.|$|E
5|$|The {{life history}} {{characteristics}} of the silky shark differ across its range (see table). Northwestern Atlantic sharks tend to be larger {{than those in the}} western-central Pacific at all ages, while eastern Pacific sharks tend to be smaller than sharks in other regions. <b>Eastern</b> <b>Atlantic</b> and Indian Ocean sharks seem to match or exceed the size of northwestern Atlantic sharks, but the figures are based on relatively few individuals and more data are needed.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Fausto {{were from a}} {{tropical}} wave that emerged into the <b>eastern</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean from {{the west coast of}} Africa on August11. It crossed the Atlantic and Caribbean uneventfully. The tropical wave ultimately entered the Eastern Pacific Basin on August 17. Rapidly organizing, the system was classified using the Dvorak technique at 1800UTC on August18. Although a broad closed circulation was present on August19, the system became less organized and thus was not immediately classified as a tropical depression.|$|E

In the western Atlantic, it occurs from the Georges Bank off New England southward to Florida, the Bahamas, and the northeastern Gulf of Mexico; there are also scattered reports from Venezuela to Argentina and on the Barrier reef in Belize. In the <b>eastern</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> it occurs from the southern Bay of Biscay to Angola, including the Mediterranean Sea, Madeira, and the Canary Islands.

5|$|Tropical Storm Vince {{was named}} on October 9 {{in the east}} Atlantic near Madeira (east-southeast of the Azores) and was {{upgraded}} to a hurricane later that day though later analysis indicated that it had formed as a subtropical storm the previous day. Although Vince was a very small and short-lived storm that only briefly reached hurricane strength, it was notable for developing in the <b>eastern</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> well away from where hurricanes are usually found. This may be the farthest north and east a tropical cyclone has ever formed in the Atlantic Basin.|$|E
5|$|Troubridge {{and most}} of his crew were removed from their ship and taken aboard Nielly's {{flagship}} Sans Pareil, where they remained {{for the rest of the}} campaign. They were replaced by 200 French sailors taken from Nielly's squadron, as Castor was hastily refitted at sea for service with the French Navy. Command was given to Captain L'Huillier, who operated as a scout for Nielly's squadron until 24 May, when he became detached while chasing the Dutch merchant ship Maria Gertruda, which had been separated from a Dutch convoy that had been attacked by Villaret's fleet on 19 May. Separated from Nielly's ships, L'Huillier turned back towards Europe with the Dutch ship in tow. While the French fleets and squadrons searched the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Atlantic</b> for the convoy, the Royal Navy was equally active with a number of squadrons and independently sailing warships complementing the main fleet under Lord Howe. One such ship was the small 28-gun frigate HMS Carysfort under Captain Francis Laforey. Laforey was cruising the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Atlantic</b> for signs of the French convoy when on 29 May his lookouts sighted two sails ahead.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 29. It tracked slowly westward, and first showed signs of development two days later. On August 31, a second tropical wave exited the coast of Africa at a faster speed than its predecessor. The two waves interacted, and by September 2 combined to form a large area of disturbed weather across the <b>eastern</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean. Convection increased within the system, and it developed a concentrated area of convection in conjunction with a well-defined low pressure area. By late on September 3, the system maintained a broad closed circulation and enough convective organization to be classified Tropical Depression Six while located about midway between the Lesser Antilles and Africa.|$|E
5|$|An upper-level tropospheric trough {{persisted in}} the <b>eastern</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean, {{developing}} a circulation by October 26 which quickly organized. On October 27, it developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen about 860miles (1380kilometers) south-southwest {{of the western}} Azores. Moving westward, the depression was forecast to attain winds of at least 60mph (95km/h), although it failed to reach that intensity. Banding features developed over the storm, and on October 30 it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Lorenzo. By early on October 31, convection had begun to separate from the circulation, {{and later in the}} day Lorenzo became extratropical; shortly thereafter, its remnants merged with a frontal system about 690mi (1,110km) west of the Azores.|$|E
5|$|Between 7 June and 26 August, New Jersey formed part of {{the first}} {{training}} squadron to cruise Northern European waters since the beginning of World War II. Over two thousand United States Naval Academy and NROTC midshipmen received seagoing experience under the command of Admiral Richard L. Connolly, Commander Naval Forces <b>Eastern</b> <b>Atlantic</b> and Mediterranean, who broke his flag in New Jersey at Rosyth, Scotland 23 June. She was the scene of official receptions at Oslo, where King Haakon VII of Norway inspected the crew 2 July, and at Portsmouth, England. The training fleet was westward bound 18 July for exercises in the Caribbean and Western Atlantic.|$|E
50|$|Observed {{variations}} in {{the strength of the}} <b>eastern</b> equatorial <b>Atlantic</b> upwelling zone {{can also be used to}} support a cycle of the North African Monsoon that is regulated by the precession cycle. When insolation in North Africa is at its peak during the precession cycle the easterly trade winds over the equatorial Atlantic are strongly diverted toward the Sahara. This diversion weakens the equatorial upwelling zone in the <b>eastern</b> equatorial <b>Atlantic,</b> resulting in warmer waters in the pelagic. On the other end of the spectrum when insolation in North Africa is at a minimum due to the precession cycle, the diversion of the easterly trade winds is relatively weak. Due to this the region of upwelling in the <b>eastern</b> equatorial <b>Atlantic</b> remains strong and the waters in the pelagic zone are cooler. The proof that this pattern of periodic weakening of the <b>eastern</b> equatorial <b>Atlantic</b> upwelling exists is found in deposits of surface dwelling planktic organisms in ocean sediment cores. Such cores show that the relative abundance of warm and cold water planktic species vary with a consistent beat of 23,000 years, matching the 23,000 year precession insolation cycle.|$|R

5|$|Development of Igor quickly ceased once it {{was named}} as a nearby {{disturbance}} produced moderate wind shear over the storm, displacing convection from its center. Embedded within a monsoon trough over the <b>eastern</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> the system maintained a slow westward track as it weakened to a tropical depression on September9. Intensification resumed the following day once shear lessened and the dominant steering factor shifted to a mid-tropospheric ridge north of Igor; it would remain so throughout {{the remainder of the}} cyclone's existence. Contrary to its earlier movement, the storm's forward motion markedly increased. Following the development of an intermittent eye feature and steady convection around its center, Igor strengthened into a hurricane around 0000UTC on September12.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Danielle was {{the first}} of several Cape Verde-type {{hurricane}}s to form during the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season. Danielle was the fourth named storm and third hurricane of the season. Danielle formed on August13, 2004 in the far <b>eastern</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean and remained over the central Atlantic, peaking as a strong Category 2 hurricane on August16. Reaching cooler waters, Danielle began to weaken, becoming a remnant low on August21 and dissipating on August24. Danielle never approached land, although it briefly threatened the Azores as it made a northerly turn. As a result, there was no impact caused by the storm.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Florence was {{the first}} North Atlantic {{hurricane}} to produce hurricane-force winds {{on the island of}} Bermuda since Hurricane Fabian in September 2003. The seventh tropical storm and second hurricane of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season, Florence developed from a tropical wave in the <b>eastern</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean on September3. Due to unfavorable conditions, the system failed to organize initially, and as a result, the storm grew to an unusually large size. After several days, Florence encountered an area of lesser wind shear and intensified into a hurricane on September10. It passed just west of Bermuda while recurving northeastward, and on September13 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.|$|E
