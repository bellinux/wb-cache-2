25|$|The {{most common}} way of {{recycling}} graphite occurs when synthetic graphite electrodes are either manufactured and pieces are cut off or lathe turnings are discarded, or the electrode (or other) are used {{all the way}} down to the <b>electrode</b> <b>holder.</b> A new electrode replaces the old one, but a sizeable piece of the old electrode remains. This is crushed and sized, and the resulting graphite powder is mostly used to raise the carbon content of molten steel. Graphite-containing refractories are sometimes also recycled, but often not because of their graphite: the largest-volume items, such as carbon-magnesite bricks that contain only 15–25% graphite, usually contain too little graphite. However, some recycled carbon-magnesite brick is used as the basis for furnace-repair materials, and also crushed carbon-magnesite brick is used in slag conditioners. While crucibles have a high graphite content, the volume of crucibles used and then recycled is very small.|$|E

500|$|To {{strike the}} {{electric}} arc, the electrode {{is brought into}} contact with the workpiece by a very light touch with the electrode to the base metal then is pulled back slightly. This initiates the arc and thus the melting of the workpiece and the consumable electrode, and causes droplets of the electrode to be passed from the electrode to the weld pool. Striking an arc, which varies widely based upon electrode and workpiece composition, can be the hardest skill for beginners. The orientation of the electrode to workpiece is where most stumble, if the electrode is held at a perpendicular angle to the workpiece the tip will likely stick to the metal which will fuse the electrode to the workpiece which will cause it to heat up very rapidly. The tip of the electrode needs to be at a lower angle to the workpiece, which allows the weld pool to flow out of the arc. [...] As the electrode melts, the flux covering disintegrates, giving off shielding gases that protect the weld area from oxygen and other atmospheric gases. In addition, the flux provides molten slag which covers the filler metal as it travels from the electrode to the weld pool. Once part of the weld pool, the slag floats to the surface and protects the weld from contamination as it solidifies. Once hardened, it must be chipped away to reveal the finished weld. As welding progresses and the electrode melts, the welder must periodically stop welding to remove the remaining electrode stub and insert a new electrode into the <b>electrode</b> <b>holder.</b> This activity, combined with chipping away the slag, reduces {{the amount of time that}} the welder can spend laying the weld, making SMAW one of the least efficient welding processes.

This analysis yields relatively well-defined values for the homogeneous membrane parameters and estimates for those of the surface layers and hence supports our hypothesis.

Na-montmorillonite suspensions are characterized by an anisotropic surface charge distribution: a permanent high surface charge of their basal planes and a pH and salinity dependent surface charge of their edge planes. Current complex impedance measurements of charged suspensions are limited at low frequencies (typically < 1 kHz) by the electrochemical polarization of the current and potential electrodes and by the phase accuracy of the impedancemeter. A new four <b>electrodes</b> sample <b>holder</b> (separate current injection and potential electrodes, Fig. 1 a) and a very high accuracy impedancemeter 2 are proposed to improve the low-frequency complex impedance measurements of charged Na-montmorillonite suspensions.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is an {{experimental}} and clinical investigation of subcutaneous (sc) tissue Po, monitoring of the fetus with a needle-electrode. The construction and characteristics of this electrode are described in Chapter 2. The oxygen-electrode is a monopolar polarographic cathode, incorporated in a small needle (O. D. 0. 4 mm). The needle is mounted in a holder, containing two spirals for fixation and simultaneous ECG-recording. In Chapters 3 and 4, first experience with the needle-electrode in the fetal lamb is described. Fetal scPo 2 was compared with the continuously recorded carotid Pao 2, while variations in fetal oxygen supply were brought about by altering the Pao 2 of the ewe or by umbilical cord occlusion. A fall in carotid Pao 2 was immediately followed by a fall inSCP 02, but recovery {{after a period of}} hypoxemia was sometimes markedly delayed, probably due to peripheral vasoconstriction. A good correlation was found between SCP 02 and carotid Pao 2, but the relationship was not linear. There appeared to be a more pronounced fall in scPo 2 at lower arterial values. Chapter 5 describes a modification of the original <b>electrode.</b> The <b>holder</b> of the original design had an oblong shape and therefore was susceptible to forces exerted by the birth canal. The modified electrode, provided with a flat holder, secured better fixation of the needle tip in the deeper layers of the subcutaneous tissue of the scalp. This prevented tissue damage caused by movement of the needle. A comparison of the performances of the two designs during labour revealed that the modified electrode measured higher Po 2 values. In Chapter 6 experience with the modified SCP 02 electrode is described in 25 patients during labour. The electrode could be easily applied at a cervical dilatation of 1 - 2 cm. During the first hour of labour, the highest Po 2 values were measured (mean 29. 4 ± 7. 5 mmHg).

40|$|Nearly all Department of Energy (DOE) {{facilities}} have landfills and buried waste areas. Of the various contaminants present at these sites, dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPL) are particularly hard {{to locate and}} remove. There is an increasing need for external or non-invasive sensing techniques to locate DNAPLs in the subsurface and to track their spread and monitor their breakdown or removal by natural or engineered means. G. Olhoeft and colleagues have published several reports based on laboratory studies using the complex resistivity method which indicate that organic solvents, notably toluene, PCE, and TCE, residing in clay-bearing soils have distinctive electrical signatures. These results have suggested to many researchers {{the basis of an}} ideal new measurement technique for geophysical characterization of DNAPL pollution. Encouraged by these results we proposed to bring the field measurement of complex resistivity as a means of pollution characterization from the conceptual stage to practice. We planned to document the detectability of clay-organic solvent interactions with geophysical measurements in the laboratory, develop further understanding of the underlying physical and chemical mechanisms, and then apply these observations to develop field techniques. As with any new research endeavor we note the extreme importance of trying to reproduce the work of previous researchers to ensure that any effects observed are due to the physical phenomena occurring in the specimen and not due to the particular experimental apparatus or method used. To this end, we independently designed and built a laboratory system, including a sample <b>holder,</b> <b>electrodes,</b> electronics, and data analysis software, for the measurement of the complex electrical resistivity properties of soil contaminated with organic solvents. The capabilities and reliability of this technique were documented. Using various standards we performed measurement accuracy, repeatability, and noise immunity tests of this system {{and we were able to}} reproduce some key complex resistivity effects quoted in the literature. We attempted numerous times to reproduce the seminal results of Olhoeft and Sadowski on the complex resistivity response of toluene-contaminated clay-rich samples. While we observe similar responses to theirs for plain clays with brine, the addition of toluene does not produce the effects they claimed. We can only produce effects of similar magnitude if we intentionally introduce a large artificial dielectric heterogeneity in the specimen. We have also performed laboratory studies to test the sensitivity of the complex resistivity method to toluene and methanol contamination in sands, clays, and rocks. Additionally, we performed 4 -wire IP inversion measurements in a two-dimensional laboratory 'ant farm' to test the ability of this technique to image materials with both conductivity and dielectric heterogeneities. This work indicates, at best, a low sensitivity of the complex electrical resistivity method to organic contamination in rocks and soils. This reduces the short-term prospects of using complex resistivity as an effective technique to directly detect organic contamination. However, as noise suppression techniques improve and further understanding of electrical responses in Earth materials is achieved, the potential of the complex resistivity technique should improve. In contrast, we find that certain electrically polarizing materials, some clays for example, have responses large enough compared to sandy and silty soils to be reliably imaged through a detailed field IP survey. Thus, quantifying soil heterogeneity (which may relate to DNAPL distribution and transport) is an immediate potential application of this technique...|$|R

Therefore, a new <b>electrode</b> <b>holder</b> was constructed based on the clinically used DTL-electrode and compared to CLEs. Material and methods: ERGs were recorded with both electrode types in nine healthy Brown-Norway rats under scotopic conditions. For low intensity responses a Naka-Rushton function was fitted and the parameters V(max), k and n were analyzed. The a-wave, b-wave and oscillatory potentials were analyzed for brighter flash intensities (1 - 60 scot cd s/m(2)). Repeatability was assessed for both electrode types in consecutive measurements. Results: The new <b>electrode</b> <b>holder</b> was faster in setting up than the CLE and showed lower standard deviations. No corneal alterations were observed. Slightly higher amplitudes were recorded {{in most of the}} measurements with the new <b>electrode</b> <b>holder</b> (except amplitudes induced by 60 cd s/m(2)). A Bland-Altman test showed good agreement between the DTL holder and the CLE (mean difference 35. 2 mu V (Holder-CLE)). Pearson`s correlation coefficient for test-retest-reliability was r = 0. 783. Conclusions: The DTL holder was superior in handling and caused far less corneal problems than the CLE and produced comparable or better electrophysiological results. The minimal production costs and the possibility of adapting the DTL holder to bigger eyes, such as for dogs or rabbits, offers with broader application prospects. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.
