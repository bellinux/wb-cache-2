40|$|Mass {{balance is}} an {{integral}} part of any comprehensive <b>glaciological</b> <b>investigation.</b> Unfortunately, it is hard to determine at remote locations where there is no fixed reference. The Global Positioning System (GPS) offers a solution. Simultaneous GPS observations at a known location and the remote field site, processed differentially, will accurately position the camp site. From there, a monument planted in the firn atop the ice can also be accurately positioned. Change in the monument's vertical position is a direct indicator of ice thickness change. Because the monument is not connected to the ice, its motion is due to both mass balance change and to the settling of firn as it densifies into ice. Observations of relative position change between the monument and anchors at various depths within the firn are used to remove the settling effect. An experiment to test this method has begun at Byrd Station on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and the first epoch of observations was made. Analysis indicates that positioning errors will be very small. It appears likely that the largest errors involved with this technique will arise from ancillary data needed to determine firn settling...|$|E
40|$|Is {{groundwater}} {{abundant in}} Antarctica {{and does it}} modulate ice flow? Answering this question matters because ice streams flow by gliding over a wet substrate of till. Water fed to ice-stream beds thus influences ice-sheet dynamics and, potentially, sea-level rise. It is recognised that both till and the sedimentary basins from which it originates are porous and could host a reservoir of mobile groundwater that interacts with the subglacial interfacial system. According to recent numerical modelling {{up to half of}} all water available for basal lubrication, and time lags between hydrological forcing and ice-sheet response as long as millennia, may have been overlooked in models of ice flow. Here, we review evidence in support of Antarctic groundwater and propose how it can be measured to ascertain {{the extent to which it}} modulates ice flow. We present new seismoelectric soundings of subglacial till, and magnetotelluric and transient electromagnetic forward models of subglacial groundwater reservoirs. We demonstrate that multi-facetted and integrated geophysical datasets can detect, delineate and quantify the groundwater contents of subglacial sedimentary basins and, potentially, monitor groundwater exchange rates between subglacial till layers.

40|$|Here {{we present}} {{the results of a}} {{comprehensive}} <b>glaciological</b> <b>investigation</b> of Union Glacier (79 ° 46 ' S/ 83 ° 24 ' W) in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), a major outlet glacier within the Ellsworth Mountains. Union Glacier flows into the Ronne Ice Shelf, where recent models have indicated the potential for significant grounding line zone (GLZ) migrations in response to changing climate and ocean conditions. To elaborate a glaciological base line that can help to evaluate the potential impact of this GLZ change scenario, we installed an array of stakes on Union Glacier in 2007. The stake network has been surveyed repeatedly for elevation, velocity, and net surface mass balance. The region of the stake measurements is in near-equilibrium, and ice speeds are 10 to 33 m a − 1. Ground-penetrating radars (GPR) have been used to map the subglacial topography, internal structure, and crevasse frequency and depth along surveyed tracks in the stake site area. The bedrock in this area has a minimum elevation of − 858 m a. s. l., significantly deeper than shown by BEDMAP 2 data. However, between this deeper area and the local GLZ, there is a threshold where the subglacial topography shows a maximum altitude of 190 m. This subglacial condition implies that an upstream migration of the GLZ will not have strong effects on Union Glacier until it passes beyond this shallow ice pinning point...|$|E

A recently founded Junior Researchers Group at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) is studying chang- ing processes in cryosphere and atmosphere above the Antarctic Peninsula. It is the aim of the group to make use of long-term remote sensing data sets of the land and ice surface and the atmosphere in order to characterize changes in this sensitive region. One aspect focuses on the application of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for <b>glaciological</b> <b>investigations</b> on the Antarctic Peninsula. The data had been acquired by the European Remote Sensing (ERS- 1 and ERS- 2) satellites and received at DLR’s Antarctic station GARS O’Higgins. Even though recent <b>glaciological</b> <b>investigations</b> often make use of modern polar-orbiting single-pass SAR-systems like e. g. TanDEM-X, only ERS- 1 (1991 – 2000) and its follow-up mission ERS- 2 (1995 – 2011) provided a 20 years’ time series of continuous measurements, which offers great potential for long-term studies. Interferometric synthetic radar (InSAR) and differential interferometric synthetic radar (DInSAR) methods as well as the intensity tracking technique are applied to create value-added glaciological SAR-products, such as glacier velocity maps, coherence maps, interferograms and differential interferograms with the aim to make them accessible to interested scientific end-users. These products are suitable for glaciological applications, e. g. determinations of glacier extend, and grounding line position, glacier and ice-stream velocities and glacier mass balance calculations with the flux-gate approach.

The 46. 9 m full depth ice core was recovered at a dome of the glacier (1960 m a. s. l.). Then glaciological and geochemical in situ analyses of the cores were made to made to clarify the past climatic change. The cooperative study was with institutions of Norway. Several dirt layers were found in the cores; the dirt layers in the upper part indicate the corresponding maximum values of electrical conductivity, different from layers in the lower part. Infiltrating water of about 1 m thick appeared in the borehole, showing a confined aquifer on the bedrock. The temperature of the borehole was nearly 0 ℃ through the entire depth except at the upper part and the firn transformed abruptly into ice at 29. 5 m; these results implied that the whole glacier has the property of a temperate glacier. The grain size increased one order of magnitude in a short interval just below the firn-ice interface, probably due to immersion of ice body into 0 ℃ water. A significantly large dip of foliation at the middle layer suggested existence of glacier flow at the boring site. The annual layers were not identified from seasonal variations of in situ analyses. However, from accumulation data for the last 20 years, the age bottom ice was estimated to be about 17 years before the present investigation...|$|E
40|$|Merzbacher Lake {{provides}} one of {{the most}} regular glacier outburst floods (GLOF) of known glacier dammed lakes. Almost every year the rising lake level due to increased melt rates in early summer leads to a seepage of lake water underneath the glacier tongue. Subsequent fast erosion of the water channels creates massive GLOFs with outflow rates of more than 1000 qm³/s. During the refilling of the lake in spring large amounts of ice is discharged into the growing lake. In the summer 2005 <b>glaciological</b> <b>investigations</b> focussed on the determination of mass fluxes involved in the dynamic response of the ice dam. For this purpose surface ablation, ice thicknesses and ice velocities were measured along several transects on the ice dam and adjacent areas. In addition weather information recorded at base camp, situated on the lateral moraine, provide the necessary input for spatial and temporal extrapolation of the ablation stake measurements. Despite difficult conditions, due the abundance of melt water and a rather widespread debris cover, ground penetrating radar investigations showed ice thicknesses of more than 300 m {{in the vicinity of the}} ice dam.

In 2014 – 2015, the glaciological polygon named after Leonid Govorukha was established on glaciers Mushketov and Semenov-Tyan-Shanskiy. Two years of observations on the glaciers allowed us to estimate the mass balance of the Mushketov Glacier, which was positive in the 2013 – 2015. By {{the end of the}} melting periods, a superimposed ice was formed on the glacier with thickness of 4  cm in 2014 and 17  cm in 2015, on the average.

40|$|The Montasio Occidentale glacier is a low-{{altitude}}, avalanche-fed glacier {{located at}} the base of the north wall of Mt. Jôf di Montasio (2754 m a. s. l.), in the Julian Alps. Its mean altitude is 1910 m and its current area is 6. 8 ha. Recent geomorphological, geophysical e <b>glaciological</b> <b>investigations</b> on this glacier highlighted its peculiar behaviour, compared to the most part of the glaciers in the European Alps. In particular, the ﬁeld data suggest a higher sensitivity to winter precipitation and a lower sensitivity to summer temperatures, with the important (negative) feedback of the debris cover in regulating its response to climatic changes. The hydrological year 2011 -’ 12 was characterized by scarce winter precipitation and high summer temperatures in the Julian Alps. Thus, we had the opportunity to study the reaction of the glacier when subject to much different climatic conditions compared to the previous years. The glacier was entirely surveyed on 17 May and 5 October 2012, by means of a Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS), which enabled the calculation of two high-resolution (10 x 10 cm) Digital Terrain Models (DTM) of the glacier and of the surrounding slopes. The mass balance of the glacier, calculated by DTM differencing using the so-called geodetic method, was much more negative than in previous years and the snow- and ﬁrn-covered area shrunk signiﬁcantly. The important role of the debris cover in reducing ablation in the lower part of the glacier was conﬁrmed by the new observations, corroborating the previous ﬁeld evidences. Collapse structures due to the breakdown of subglacial cavities were also detected, as well as local reworking of the debris cover by meltwater and/or rainwater. The high-resolution DTMs also enabled the quantiﬁcation of the very low surface velocities (few decimeters per year) which characterize this ice body, and of changes in the surface displacement compared to previous observations...|$|R

Snow accumulation rate and isotope content (δ D, δ 18 O and δ 17 O) were measured along the 2  km profile across the megadune ridge accompanied by precise GPS altitude measurements and ground penetrating radar (GPR) survey. It is shown that the spatial variability of snow accumulation and isotope content covaries with the surface slope. The accumulation rate regularly changes by 1 order of magnitude within the distance <  1  km, with the reduced accumulation at the leeward slope of the dune and increased accumulation in the hollow between the dunes. At the same time, the accumulation rate averaged over the length of a dune wave (22  mm w. e.) corresponds well with the value obtained at Vostok Station, which suggests no additional wind-driven snow sublimation in the megadunes compared to the surrounding plateau. The snow isotopic composition is in negative correlation with the snow accumulation. Analysing dxs ∕  δ D and 17 O-excess ∕  δ D slopes (where dxs [*]=[*]  δ D − 8 [*]⋅[*] δ 18 O and 17 O-excess [*]=[*] ln(δ 17 O  ∕ [*] 1000 [*]+[*][*] 1) − 0. 528 [*]⋅[*]ln (δ 18 O ∕  1000 [*]+[*] 1)), we conclude that the spatial variability of the snow isotopic composition in the megadune area could be explained by post-depositional snow modifications. Using the GPR data, we estimated the apparent dune drift velocity (4. 6  ±  1. 1  m yr − 1). The full cycle of the dune drift is thus about 410  years. Since the spatial anomalies of snow accumulation and isotopic composition are supposed to drift with the dune, a core drilled in the megadune area would exhibit the non-climatic 410 -year cycle of these two parameters. We simulated a vertical profile of snow isotopic composition with such a non-climatic variability, using the data on the dune size and velocity. This artificial profile is then compared with the real vertical profile of snow isotopic composition obtained from a core drilled in the megadune area. We note that the two profiles are very similar. The obtained results are discussed in terms of interpretation of data obtained from ice cores drilled beyond the megadune areas...|$|R

The total investments to construct the laboratory were 28. 8 million rubles, provided by Roshydromet and AARI in frames of implementing the program of International Polar Year. The total area of the laboratory is about 300 m² that includes mass-spectrometric and gas analyses labs, cold chambers and utility rooms. The CERL’s equipment comprises laser stable water isotope analyzer Picarro L 2120 -i, IR mass-spectrometer Delta V Plus, system of gas extraction from ice, facilities for ice petrographic observations, for ice core treatment and storage. Before 2014 CERL was the head unit in the project “Complex studies of Lake Vostok and <b>glaciological</b> <b>investigations</b> of Antarctica” of the sub-program “Antarctica” of the FTP “World Ocean”. Now CERL is the leading organization in International Associated Laboratory “Ice archives of climatic and environmental data” that combines 4 French and 5 Russian scientific research groups.

40|$|Over 80 % of {{the flow}} of the Upper Indus River is derived from less than 20 % of its area: {{essentially}} from zones of heavy snowfall and glacierized basins above 3500 m elevation. The trans-Himalaya n contribution comes largely from an area of some 20000 km 2 of glacierized basins, mostly along the axis of the Greater Karakoram range and especially from 20 - 30 of the largest glacier basins. Very few <b>glaciological</b> <b>investigations</b> have so far been undertaken in this the major glacierized region of Central Asia. Biafo Glacier, one of the largest of the Karakoram glaciers, drains south-eastwards from the central Karakoram crest. Its basin covers a total area of 853 km 2, 628 km 2 of which are permanent snow and ice, with 68 % of the glacier area forming the accumulation zone. This paper describes investigations of snow accumulation, ablation, glacier movement, and glacier depth undertaken in the period 1985 - 87, set against a background of investigations carried out over the last 130 yea rs. Biafo Glacier differs from most of the other Karakoram glaciers in being nourished mainly by direct snowfall rather than by avalanching; this has the advantage of allowing extensive investigation of accumulation over a broad range of altitude. Snow-accumulation studies in the Biafo Glacier basin have indicated that annual accumulation varies from 0. 9 to 1. 9 m of water equivalent between 4650 and 5450 m a [...] s. l. This suggests an annual moisture input above the equilibrium line of approximately 0. 6 km 3. Monopulse radar measurements indicate the presence of ice thickness as great as 1400 m at the equilibrium line, although these results may not be completely reliable. Mean surface velocity during the summer of 0. 8 m d -I has been measured near to the equilibrium line. Calculations of annual ice flux through the vertical cross-profile at the equilibrium line indicate a throughput of 0. 7 km 3 a-I Estimates from stake ablation measurements also suggest that ice loss on Biafo Glacier is about 0. 7 km 3 a-I. The close agreement between these three sets of measurements is reassuring, indicating that the ablation zone of Biafo Glacier, whose area covers 0. 09 % of the whole Upper Indus basin, produces approximately 0. 9 % of the total run-off. However. it should be mentioned that this estimate does not include water originating from seasonal snow melt, e either above or below the equilibrium line, or from rainfall. Net annual ice losses due to wastage of the glacier since 1910 are probably of the order of 0. 4 -{). 5 m a-I; this would represent between 12 and 15 % of annual water yield from melting ice...|$|R

Density measurements, stratigraphie analyses with aid of a throughlight profile and hardness determination are described in more detail. The analyses of the Fi 1 chner snow profile of January 1980 with suplements of January 1981 reveal 7 complete budget years for 370 cm depth or 53 cm snow accumulation/year, With a mean density of 0. 377 g/cm** 2 this value corresponds to a water equivalent of 20 g/cm** 2. At the Atka site 3 budget years were determined within 210 cm depth of the snow pit or 70 cm of mean annual accumulaticn. With the rat her higher mean density of 0. 438 g/cm** 2 for this site the corresponding water equivalent amounts here to 30 g/cm** 2, In addition to the snow pit studies shallow drillings were made at Filchner Station to a depth of 10. 8 m with 128 sampies taken from the core and at Atka to 12. 1 m depth with 114 sampies. At the Institute for Radiohydrometry, Neuherberg, the sarnples were analysed with respect to the stable isotope ratios 2 H/ 1 H and 18 O/ 16 O related to V-SMOW. Also the tritium content was measured. The vartiations of the stable isotope ratios with the depth show quasiperiodic fluctuations which are regarded as annual cycles of the accumulation rate. Counting of the pronounced peaks leads to 20 years for the Filchner core, giving 55 cm annual accumulation or 22 g/cm** 2 water equivalent respectively. At Atka 15 years could be found corresponding to 75 cm annual accumulation or 32 g/cm** 2 of water. The range of varianon and the mean value of the stable isotope ratios are significantly different for both sites, the agreement of the isotopic anal yses with the pit studies is rat her satisfactory. The tritium content shows for the Filchner core two pronounced peaks which can be related to the 1965 and 1966 winter seasons according to former studies at the South Pole station. These time estimates are consistent with the time scale derived fr orn the stable isotopes distribution. At the Atka site no similar effeet in the tritium values was found.

The book is intended to give an overview on all aspects of the scientific utilization of geodetic-geophysical observations in Antarctica, of data analysis and geodynamic interpretation as well as of the various technological aspects in setting up autonomous observatories in Antarctica...|$|R
40|$|Stubacher Sonnblickkees (SSK) {{is located}} in the Hohe Tauern Range (Eastern Alps) in the south of Salzburg Province (Austria) in the region of Oberpinzgau in the upper Stubach Valley. The glacier is {{situated}} at the main Alpine crest and faces east, starting at elevations close to 3050 m and in the 1980 s terminated at 2500 m a. s. l. It had an area of 1. 7 km² at that time, compared with 1 km² in 2013. The glacier type can be classified as a slope glacier, i. e. the relief is covered by a relatively thin ice sheet and there is no regular glacier tongue. The rough subglacial topography makes for a complex shape in the surface topography, with various concave and convex patterns. The main reason for selecting this glacier for mass balance observations (as early as 1963) was to verify on a complex glacier how the mass balance methods and the conclusions - derived during the more or less pioneer phase of <b>glaciological</b> <b>investigations</b> in the 1950 s and 1960 s - could be applied to the SSK glacier. The decision was influenced by the fact that close to the SSK there was the Rudolfshütte, a hostel of the Austrian Alpine Club (OeAV), newly constructed in the 1950 s to replace the old hut dating from 1874. The new Alpenhotel Rudolfshütte, which was run by the Slupetzky family from 1958 to 1970, was the base station for the long-term observation; the cable car to Rudolfshütte, operated by the Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB), was a logistic advantage. Another factor for choosing SSK as a glaciological research site was the availability of discharge records of the catchment area from the Austrian Federal Railways who had turned the nearby lake Weißsee ('White Lake') - a former natural lake - into a reservoir for their hydroelectric power plants. In terms of regional climatic differences between the Central Alps in Tyrol and those of the Hohe Tauern, the latter experienced significantly higher precipitation, so one could expect new insights in the different response of the two glaciers SSK and Hintereisferner (Ötztal Alps) - where a mass balance series went back to 1952. In 1966 another mass balance series with an additional focus on runoff recordings was initiated at Vernagtfener, near Hintereisferner, by the Commission of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences in Munich. The usual and necessary link to climate and climate change was given by a newly founded weather station (by Heinz and Werner Slupetzky) at the Rudolfshütte in 1961, which ran until 1967. Along with an extension and enlargement to the so-called Alpine Center Rudolfshütte of the OeAV, a climate observatory (suggested by Heinz Slupetzky) has been operating without interruption since 1980 under the responsibility of ZAMG and the Hydrological Service of Salzburg, providing long-term met observations. The weather station is supported by the Berghotel Rudolfshütte (in 2004 the OeAV sold the hotel to a private owner) with accommodation and facilities. Direct yearly mass balance measurements were started in 1963, first for 3 years as part of a thesis project. In 1965 the project was incorporated into the Austrian glacier measurement sites within the International Hydrological Decade (IHD) 1965 - 1974 and was afterwards extended via the International Hydrological Program (IHP) 1975 - 1981. During both periods the main financial support came from the Hydrological Survey of Austria. After 1981 funds were provided by the Hydrological Service of the Federal Government of Salzburg. The research was conducted from 1965 onwards by Heinz Slupetzky from the (former) Department of Geography of the University of Salzburg. These activities received better recognition when the High Alpine Research Station of the University of Salzburg was founded in 1982 and brought in additional funding from the University. With recent changes concerning Rudolfshütte, however, it became unfeasible to keep the research station going. Fortunately, at least the weather station at Rudolfshütte is still operating. In the pioneer years of the mass balance recordings at SSK, the main goal was to understand the influence of the complicated topography on the ablation and accumulation processes. With frequent strong southerly winds (foehn) on the one hand, and precipitation coming in with storms from the north to northwest, the snow drift is an important factor on the undulating glacier surface. This results in less snow cover in convex zones and in more or a maximum accumulation in concave or flat areas. As a consequence of the accentuated topography, certain characteristic ablation and accumulation patterns can be observed during the summer season every year, which have been regularly observed for many decades. The process of snow depletion (Ausaperung) runs through a series of stages (described by the AAR) every year. The sequence of stages {{until the end of the}} ablation season depends on the weather conditions in a balance year. One needs a strong negative mass balance year at the beginning of glacier measurements to find out the regularities; 1965, the second year of observation resulted in a very positive mass balance with very little ablation but heavy accumulation. To date it is the year with the absolute maximum positive balance in the entire mass balance series since 1959, probably since 1950. The highly complex ablation patterns required a high number of ablation stakes at the beginning of the research and it took several years to develop a clearer idea of the necessary density of measurement points to ensure high accuracy. A great number of snow pits and probing profiles (and additional measurements at crevasses) were necessary to map the accumulation area/patterns. Mapping the snow depletion, especially at the end of the ablation season, which coincides with the equilibrium line, is one of the main basic data for drawing contour lines of mass balance and to calculate the total mass balance (on a regular-shaped valley glacier there might be an equilibrium line following a contour line of elevation separating the accumulation area and the ablation area, but not at SSK). - An example: in 1969 / 70, 54 ablation stakes and 22 snow pits were used on the 1. 77 km² glacier surface. In the course of the study the consistency of the accumulation and ablation patterns could be used to reduce the number of measurement points. - At the SSK the stratigraphic system, i. e. the natural balance year, is used instead the usual hydrological year. From 1964 to 1981, the yearly mass balance was calculated by direct measurements. Based on these records of 17 years, a regression analysis between the specific net mass balance and the ratio of ablation area to total area (AAR) has been used since then. The basic requirement was mapping the maximum snow depletion at the end of each balance year. There was the advantage of Heinz Slupetzky's detailed local and long-term experience, which ensured homogeneity of the series on individual influences of the mass balance calculations. Verifications took place as often as possible by means of independent geodetic methods, i. e. monoplotting, aerial and terrestrial photogrammetry, more recently also the application of PHOTOMODELLER and laser scans. The semi-direct mass balance determinations used at SSK were tentatively compared with data from periods of mass/volume change, resulting in promising first results on the reliability of the method. In recent years re-analyses of the mass balance series have been conducted by the World Glacier Monitoring Service and will be done at SSK too. - The methods developed at SSK also add to another objective, much discussed in the 1960 s within the community, namely to achieve time- and labour-saving methods to ensure continuation of long-term mass balance series. The regression relations were used to extrapolate the mass balance series back to 1959, the maximum depletion could be reconstructed by means of photographs for those years. R. Günther (1982) calculated the mass balance series of SSK back to 1950 by analysing the correlation between meteorological data and the mass balance; he found a high statistical relation between measured and determined mass balance figures for SSK. In spite of the complex glacier topography, interesting empirical experiences were gained from the mass balance data sets, giving a better understanding of the characteristics of the glacier type, mass balance and mass exchange. It turned out that there are distinct relations between the specific net balance, net accumulation (defined as Bc/S) and net ablation (Ba/S) to the AAR, resulting in characteristic so-called 'turnover curves'. The diagram of SSK represents the type of a glacier without a glacier tongue. Between 1964 and 1966, a basic method was developed, starting from the idea that instead of measuring years to cover the range between extreme positive and extreme negative yearly balances one could record the AAR/snow depletion/Ausaperung during one or two summers. The new method was applied on Cathedral Massif Glacier, a cirque glacier with the same area as the Stubacher Sonnblickkees, in British Columbia, Canada. during the summers of 1977 and 1978. It returned exactly the expected relations, e. g. mass turnover curves, as found on SSK. The SSK was mapped several times on a scale of 1 : 5000 to 1 : 10000. Length variations have been measured since 1960 within the OeAV glacier length measurement programme. Between 1965 and 1981, there was a mass gain of 10 million cubic metres. With a time lag of 10 years, this resulted in an advance until the mid- 1980 s. Since 1982 there has been a distinct mass loss of 35 million cubic metres by 2013. In recent years, the glacier has disintegrated faster, forced by the formation of a periglacial lake at the glacier terminus and also by the outcrops of rocks (typical for the slope glacier type), which have accelerated the meltdown. The formation of this lake is well documented. The glacier has retreated by some 600 m since 1981. - Since August 2002, a runoff gauge installed by the Hydrographical Service of Salzburg has recorded the discharge of the main part of SSK at the outlet of the new Unterer Eisboden See. The annual reports - submitted from 1982 on as a contractual obligation to the Hydrological Service of Salzburg - document the ongoing processes on the one hand, and emphasize the mass balance of SSK and outline the climatological reasons, mainly based on the met-data of the observatory Rudolfshütte, on the other. There is an additional focus on estimating the annual water balance in the catchment area of the lake. There are certain preconditions for the water balance equation in the area. Runoff is recorded by the ÖBB power stations, the mass balance of the now approx. 20 % glaciated area (mainly the Sonnblickkees) is measured andthe change of the snow and firn patches/the water content is estimated as well as possible. (Nowadays laserscanning and ground radar are available to measure the snow pack). There is a net of three precipitation gauges plus the recordings at Rudolfshütte. The evaporation is of minor importance. The long-term annual mean runoff depth in the catchment area is around 3. 000 mm/year. The precipitation gauges have measured deficits between 10 % and 35 %, on average probably 25 % to 30 %. That means that the real precipitation in the catchment area Weißsee (at elevations between 2, 250 and 3, 000 m) is in an order of 3, 200 to 3, 400 mm a year. The mass balance record of SSK was the first one established in the Hohe Tauern region (and now since the Hohe Tauern National Park was founded in 1983 in Salzburg) and is one of the longest measurement series worldwide. Great efforts are under way to continue the series, to safeguard against interruption and to guarantee a long-term monitoring of the mass balance and volume change of SSK (until the glacier is completely gone, which seems to be realistic in the near future as a result of the ongoing global warming).
