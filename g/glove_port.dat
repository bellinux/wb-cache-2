40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to report {{homemade}} <b>glove</b> <b>port</b> technique for single-incision laparoscopic appendectomy (SILA). Materials and Methods: Our homemade <b>glove</b> <b>port</b> was composed of a size 6 latex sterile surgical glove, a sterilized plastic bangle, and three pieces of silicon tube (5 cm in length) that were used as the suction tube. Clinical data were retrospectively collected from those patients who underwent SILA at Bucheon St. Mary's Hospital, Bucheon, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea between February 2014 and June 2014, including patient demographics, and operative and postoperative outcomes. To compare the outcomes, a retrospective review was performed for those patients who underwent conventional laparoscopic appendectomy (CLA) between October 2013 and January 2014. Both SILA and CLA were performed by the same surgical team. Results: The SILA and CLA groups included 37 and 57 patients, respectively. The mean age, weight, body mass index (BMI), operation time, and pathologic diagnosis of gangrenous appendicitis were not significantly different between the two groups. However, the mean hospital stay in the CLA group was significantly (P = 0. 018) longer than that in the SILA group (4. 2 days vs 3. 5 days). There was no conversion to open surgery in both the groups. Of the cases who underwent SILA, 10 (27. 0 %) needed insertion of additional port and drain. There was one (3. 2 %) complication of umbilical surgical site infection. Conclusion: In this study, SILA, with homemade <b>glove</b> <b>port,</b> was technically feasible and safe at low cost...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: A laparoscopic {{appendectomy}} is now commonly performed. The push {{in recent}} years toward reducing the num-ber of ports required to perform this surgery {{has led to the}} development of a single-port laparoscopic appendectomy (SPA). We compared postoperative pain after an SPA using a <b>glove</b> <b>port</b> with a percutaneous organ-holding device (group 1) with that of an SPA using a commercially-available multichannel single-port device (group 2). Methods: Between March 2010 and July 2011, a retrospective study was conducted of a total of 77 patients who underwent an SPA by three surgeons at department of surgery, Kangbuk Samsung Medical Center. Thirty-eight patients received an SPA using a <b>glove</b> <b>port</b> with a percutaneous organ-holding device. The other 39 patients received an SPA using a commer-cially-available multichannel single port (Octo-Port or SILS Port). Operative details and postoperative outcomes were col-lected and evaluated. Results: There were no differences in the mean operative times, times to pass gas, postoperative hospital stays, or cosmetic satisfaction scores between the two groups. The pain score in the first 24 hours after surgery was higher in group 2 than group 1 patients (P < 0. 001). Furthermore, the trocar used in group 2 was more expensive than that used in group 1. Conclusion: An SPA using a <b>glove</b> <b>port</b> with a percutaneous organ-holding device was associated with a lower pain score during the first 24 hours after surgery because of the shorter fascia incision length and a cheaper cost than an SPA using a commercially-available multichannel single-port device...|$|E
40|$|The Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG) is a {{versatile}} research facility designed {{to permit the}} flexibility of crew manipulated investigations on the International Space Station (ISS). The MSG configuration has been planned around {{the concept of an}} experimental workstation where a variety of experiments can be installed and operated in a fashion very similar to their operation in a ground-based laboratory. The approach has been to provide a large working volume with a significant set of power, data and imaging resources, all enclosed, but accessible by the crew through sealed <b>glove</b> <b>ports.</b> This arrangement allows the advantage of interactive experimentation without unduly compromising the experiment design with restrictions imposed by protective and containment challenges that normally arise in manned space-flight laboratories. In addition, the data and imaging resources allow cooperative monitoring of experiment progress between the crew and ground-based scientists.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{apparatus}} for germ-free rearing of animals, the author studied on the methods of germ-free rearing historically and experimentally {{under the direction of}} Professor K. Tanikawa and Associate Professor J. Tanami. In our laboratory, a new compact type of rearing unit HMC- 1 was constructed after Reyniers 2 ̆ 7 system and Gustafsson 2 ̆ 7 s apparatus in 1954. Continuously the rearing unit HMC- 2 was constructed with the useful advice given by Professor M. Miyakawa. A thermo-sterilizing plant and glass-wool filter are used for air sterilization. In order to eliminate humidity in the air a fin-coil type refrigerating desicator is used. The ventilation power of pump on the average is 60 1 per minute, and this quantity of air is sufficient for 2 rearing tanks and 1 operating tank. The rearing tank is constructed of steel 6 mm in thickness, the diameter of the tank is 60 cm and the length is 120 cm. Entire surface of the tank is covered with asbestos in 3 cm thickness. This tank has 4 <b>glove</b> <b>ports</b> and 2 viewing <b>ports,</b> <b>gloves</b> are made of artificial rubber and are fixed on the <b>glove</b> <b>ports</b> of the tank with a special ring. The operating tank is almost equal to the rearing tank in its size and shape. This tank has a chamber for the operating trap provided under it. This trap is used for moving an animal into the tank. The sterilizing food clave is a small steel tank, 25 cm in diameter and 65 cm in length. This is used for removing food, water and the other heat steriliable articles into the rearing tank. The germicidal trap is an apparatus through which all objects placed into the rearing tank, which must not be sterilized with heat, must pass. The double Seitz-filter is an apparatus through which certain kinds of solution can be filtered and sterilized. The entire system can be sterilized at the same time, but in accordance with the demands of the experiment procedures, one part of the system, either the rearing tank or the operating tank, must be separately sterilized. Because of this reason a sterilizing pipe system is constructed for that purpose. The air temperature of the rearing tank is controlled by the air temperature regulator and the hot water tank provided under part of the tank, so there must be two electric regulating system for the rearing tank. All sorts of furnishings in the rearing tanks must be provided so as not to injure the,rubber gloves during manipulation. The HMC- 2 system is arranged to form a compact unit, so the system as a whole can be set in a chamber 3. 6 m× 7. 2 m and can be used coveniently. It will be important to devise a compact system or simplified unit for germ-free rearing of animals so as to make rearing easy to perform in every laboratory wanting to do some experiments with germ-free animal. In the near future, a central system for germ-free animal production will be established in our country. At that time a simplified and compact system of germ-free rearing unit, such as the HMC- 2, will become popular and convenient...|$|R
40|$|A small, lightweight, {{collapsible}} {{glove box}} enables its user to perform small experiments and other tasks. Originally {{intended for use}} aboard a space shuttle or the International Space Station (ISS), this glove box could also be attractive for use on Earth in settings in which work space or storage space is severely limited and, possibly, {{in which it is}} desirable to minimize weight. The development of this glove box was prompted by the findings that in the original space-shuttle or ISS setting, (1) it was necessary to perform small experiments in a large general-purpose work station, so that, in effect, they occupied excessive space; and it took excessive amounts of time to set up small experiments. The design of the glove box reflects the need to minimize the space occupied by experiments and the time needed to set up experiments, plus the requirement to limit the launch weight of the box and the space needed to store the box during transport into orbit. To prepare the glove box for use, the astronaut or other user has merely to insert hands through the two fabric <b>glove</b> <b>ports</b> in the side walls of the box and move two hinges to a locking vertical position (see figure). The user could do this while seated with the glove box on the user fs lap. When stowed, the glove box is flat and has approximately the thickness of two pieces of 8 -in.

40|$|We have {{developed}} {{a new approach to}} glove box monitoring that involves drawing air out of one <b>glove</b> <b>port</b> through a detection grid that collects ions created in the air inside the glove box by ionizing radiation, especially alpha radiation. The charge deposited on the detection grid by the ions is measured with a sensitive electrometer. The air can be circulated back to the glove box through the other <b>glove</b> <b>port,</b> preventing contamination from leaving the glove box and detector system. Initial experiments using a mock-up constructed of sheet metal indicate that this technology provides the measurement technique needed to perform a defensible, non-invasive measurement of alpha contamination inside glove boxes destined for waste disposal. This can result in an enormous cost savings if a given glove box can be shown to fall into the catagory of Low-Level Waste rather than Trans-Uranic Waste. Considering that hundreds of glove boxes contaminated with plutonium will be taken out of service at various nuclear facilities over the next few years, the potential cost savings associated with disposal as LLW rather than TRU waste are substantial...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) is an {{emerging}} technique in gynaecology. The proposed {{advantages of the}} LESS include better cosmesis and reduction in pain. We report our preliminary experience with LESS {{in the treatment of}} adnexal pathology. Materials and Methods: After a preoperative workup, LESS was offered to 37 patients between July 2009 and April 2015. All the procedures were carried out through a 2 – 2. 5 cm transumbilical incision using conventional laparoscopic instruments. A single-incision, multiport (SIMP) approach (utilising one 7 mm and two 5 mm ports) was used in 27 patients and a homemade <b>glove</b> <b>port</b> (HMGP) was utilised in ten patients. All the specimens were extracted after placement in a plastic bag or inside the <b>glove</b> <b>port</b> avoiding contact with the wound. Umbilical fascial incisions were meticulously closed with non-absorbable sutures. Results: Two patients with a history of previous abdominal surgery required omental adhesiolysis. Seventeen patients with breast cancer underwent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, ten had ovarian cystectomy (6 had cystadenoma, 2 had endometriotic cysts and 2 had dermoid cyst), six had excision of paraovarian cysts (one along with partial salpingectomy) and four with ruptured ectopic pregnancy underwent salpingectomy. LESS was completed in all but one patient, who required insertion of an additional 5 mm port. There were no intra- or post-operative complications. Conclusions: Our experience confirms the feasibility and safety of LESS in a variety of benign adnexal pathology. Both the SIMP and HMGP approaches seem comparable. Performing LESS without the use of specialised access ports or instruments makes it cost effective and suitable for wider application...|$|E
40|$|Aim:  Single access {{laparoscopic surgery}} {{is a recent}} vogue {{in the field of}} {{minimally}} invasive colorectal surgery. While selected series have indicated feasibility, we prospectively examined its usefulness for resectional surgery in routine practice. Method:  All patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal resection over a twelve month period were considered for a single access approach by a single surgical team in a university hospital. This utilised a 'Glove' port via a 3 - 5 cm periumbilical or stomal site incision with standard rigid laparoscopic instruments then being used. Results:  Of 74 planned laparoscopic colorectal resections, 35 (47 %) were performed by this single incision laparoscopic modality without disruption of theatre list efficiency or surgical training obligations. The mean (range) age and BMI of these 25 consecutive right sided resections, 8 total colectomies (7 urgent operations) and 2 anterior resections was 58 (22 - 82) years and 23. 9 (18. 6 - 36. 2) kg/m(2) respectively. The modal postoperative day of discharge was 4. For right sided resections, the mean (range) post-op stay in those undergoing surgery for benign disease was 4, while for those undergoing operation for neoplasia (n= 18, mean age 71 years) it was 5. 8 days and the average lymph node harvest was 13. Use of the <b>glove</b> <b>port</b> reduced trocar cost by 58 % (€ 60 /£ 53) by allowing use of trocar sleeves alone without obturators. Conclusion:  Single incision laparoscopic surgery is an effective option for abdominal surgery and seems especially suited for laparoscopic-assisted right sided colonic resections. The <b>Glove</b> <b>port</b> technique facilitates procedural frequency and familiarity and proves economically favourable...|$|E
40|$|Microgravity science {{studies the}} {{influences}} of gravity on phenomena in fluids, materials processes, combustion, and human cell growth in the low acceleration environment of space flight. During the last decade, the accomplishment of the flight {{research in the field}} has evolved into an effective cooperation between the flight crew in the Shuttle and the ground-based investigator using real-time communication via voice and video links. This team structure has led to interactive operations in which the crew performs the experimentation while guided, as necessary, by the science investigator who formulated the investigation and who will subsequently interpret and analyze the data. One of the primary challenges to implementing this interactive research has been the necessity of structuring a means of handling fluids, gases, and hazardous materials in a manned laboratory that exhibits the novelty of weightlessness. Developing clever means of designing experiments in closed vessels is part of the solution- but the space flight requirement for one and two failure-tolerant containment systems leads to serious complications in the physical handling of sample materials. In response to the conflict between the clear advantage of human operation and judgment, versus the necessity to isolate the experiment from the crewmember and the spacecraft environment, the Microgravity Research Program has initiated a series of Gloveboxes in the various manned experiment carriers. These units provide a sealed containment vessel whose interior is under a negative pressure with respect to the ambient environment but is accessible to a crewmember through the <b>glove</b> <b>ports...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{cooperative}} research project was conducted between the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) and Johnson Controls, Inc. (JCI) {{to adapt the}} INEL spray forming process to produce near-net-shape lead alloy strip. The emphasis of the work was to spray form lead strip samples at INEL, {{using a variety of}} spray conditions, for characterization at JCI. An existing glove box apparatus was modified at INEL to spray form lead. The main spray forming components were housed inside the glove box. They included a spray nozzle, tundish (crucible), substrate assembly, gas heater and furnaces to heat the nozzle and tundish. To spray form metal strip, liquid metal was pressure-fed at a controlled rate through a series of circular orifices that span the width of the nozzle. There the metal contacted high velocity, high temperature inert gas (nitrogen) which atomized the molten material into fine droplets, entrained the droplets in a directed flow, and deposited them onto glass plates that were swept through the spray plume to form strip samples. In-flight convection cooling of the droplets followed by conduction and convection cooling at the substrate resulted in rapid solidification of the deposit. During operation, the inside of the glove box was purged with an inert gas to limit the effects of in-flight oxidation of the particles and spray-formed strips, as well as to protect personnel from exposure to airborne lead particulate. Remote controls were used to start/stop the spray and control the speed and position of the substrate. In addition, substrate samples were loaded into the substrate translator manually using the <b>gloved</b> side <b>ports</b> of the box. In this way, the glove box remained closed during a series of spray trials, and was opened only when loading the crucible with a lead charge or when removing lead strip samples for shipment to JCI...|$|R
40|$|Class of 2011 AbstactOBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} if aseptic methods prescribed by the USP 797 {{are effective in}} preventing microbial growth when compounding intravenous medication. Sample size: 60 individual IV preparations, 20 {{for the control group}} and 20 per test group. METHODS: Sixty agar plates were made. The IV preparations for the control group were compounded with aseptic technique: washing hands with soap and water, wearing <b>gloves,</b> cleaning all <b>ports</b> with alcohol, and working in a laminar flow hood. A syringe was used to inject the water from the vial into the IV bag. This procedure was repeated in the same manner for Group A (no use of laminar flow hood) and Group B (no swiping of the injection ports with an alcohol swab), minus the aseptic technique in question. Once all 60 IV preparations were completed, a sterile inoculation tool was used to obtain a sample from the port of the IV bag. The plates were then inoculated. RESULTS: When compared to the control group, microbial growth in Group A was not significant (p= 0. 14). The contamination rate for Group B was also not significant (p= 0. 07). CONCLUSION: Solutions compounded using abbreviated techniques (not swabbing injection ports and not using laminar flow hood) are not more likely to be contaminated than when using all proper aseptic techniques simultaneously...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Emerging {{concepts}} of “reduced port surgery” have gained considerable attention from laparoscopic surgeons, including {{the field of}} liver resection. To date, 86 cases of single-incision laparoscopic hepatectomy (SILH) have been reported, with commercially available access devices being used {{in most of these}} cases. We report herein a use of homemade transumbilical <b>glove</b> <b>port</b> for SILH. Methods: A 39 -year-old woman represented giant hepatic hemangioma (9 -cm in size) located at the left lateral segment (S 2 / 3). Partial hepatectomy was performed by the glove method via single port access with conventional laparoscopic bipolar forceps, grasper and scissors without the need of any single-port specific devices. Results: The operative time was 77 minutes, and intraoperative blood loss was 50 mL. The postoperative course was uneventful. Conclusions: Glove method not only has significant advantages in terms of cost, but also is superior in its versatility, allowing wider range of movements compared to conventional access devices. Taking in consideration its cost effectiveness and versatility, glove method may be a good option for SILH...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: More {{reports of}} single-incision laparoscopic {{appendectomy}} are appearing in literature {{as it is}} an improvement over multiport laparoscopy in further reducing the trauma to abdomen. But, most of techniques require expensive gadgets like commercial ports and manoeuverable instruments, which are not available at many centres. In this context, a feasibility study of our own operative technique of single-incision laparoscopic appendectomy with less expensive conventional instrumentation was conducted at a single centre. Materials and Methods: This prospective study {{was carried out in}} tertiary care teaching institute of a semi-urban area in South India over a period of 1 year from March 2011 to February 2012. Twenty-nine patients of appendicitis were included in this study. Based on the principles of single-incision laparoscopy, we developed a <b>glove</b> <b>port</b> utilizing readily available operation theatre equipment. Results: Mean operative time was 56 ± 12 minutes. Mean age of subjects was 34 ± 15 years. M: F ratio was 2 : 1. There was no significant perioperative morbidity or mortality.

40|$|Single port {{laparoscopy}} is {{a relatively}} new niche in the expanding spectrum of minimal access surgery for colorectal disease. To date the published experience has predominantly focused on planned operations for neoplasia in the elective setting. It seems probable however that the benefits of minimal abdominal wounding will be greatest among those patients with the highest risk of impaired wound healing. Combining this with the impression of improved cosmesis suggests that (the mostly young) patients with inflammatory bowel disease needing urgent operation are the most likely to appreciate and benefit from the extraoperative effort. The extension of single port surgery to the acute setting and for debilitated individuals is therefore a likely next step advance in broadening the category of patients for whom it represents a real benefit and ultimately aid in focusing by selection the subgroups for whom this technique is best suited and most appropriate. We describe here our approach (including routine use of a surgical <b>glove</b> <b>port)</b> to patients presenting for urgent colorectal operation for benign disease. As provision of specialized approaches regardless of timing or mode of presentation is a defining component of any specialty service, this concept will soon be more fully elucidated and established...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Personal {{protective}} clothing and equipment, when used during moderate to heavy workloads, can push individuals {{to the limits}} of physiological regulation. What is less certain is the physiological strain imposed by appropriately protective ensembles when riding a motorcycle, and whether or not one need even consider the impact of that strain. Nevertheless, evidence indicates that thermal discomfort is a key disincentive to the wearing of motorcycle {{protective clothing}} in hot weather. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to quantify thermal and cardiovascular strain during a simulated urban, motorcycle ride, conducted under laboratory conditions. Methods: Twelve males were investigated on four occasions across three thermal environments: 25 oC (water vapour pressure 1. 3 kPa), 30 oC (1. 7 kPa) and 35 oC (2. 25 kPa). Each trial was comprised of three, 30 -min stages: 25 min cycling (30 W) plus 5 min rest. Heart rates, and auditory-canal and mean skin temperatures were measured. Clothing was modified between full accident protection (helmet, jacket, trousers, <b>gloves,</b> boots; ventilation <b>ports</b> closed) and an unprotected state (helmet, gloves, boots, jeans, long-sleeve t-shirt), with both conditions tested at 25 oC, and the full protective ensemble also investigated at 30 o and 35 oC. Results: Increasing rider protection at 25 oC did not modify auditory-canal temperature (P> 0. 05), but mean skin temperatures (2 oC) and steady-state heart rates were displaced vertically (12 beats. min- 1; both P 38. 5 oC) and profound hyperthermia (> 40. 0 oC) were predicted to occur within 105 min (SD 20. 6) and 180 min (SD 33. 0). The latter might eventuate in ~ 10 h at 30 oC, but would not occur at 25 oC. Thermal discomfort increased sequentially in the 35 oC trial, averaging between “uncomfortable” and “very uncomfortable”. Discussion: The principal outcomes from this experiment were that, within air temperatures that approximated deep-body temperature, as may be encountered during an Australian summer, urban motorcyclists would be likely to approach profound hyperthermia and potentially debilitating central cardiovascular strain within 3 h, and earlier in sedentary and overweight riders. However, at air temperatures of 25 o and 30 oC, neither of those outcomes would be likely. What remains uncertain {{is whether or not the}} level of physiological strain encountered at 35 oC would have an adverse impact upon cognitive function, perhaps through reducing cerebral blood flow, which may, in turn, elevate the risk of motorcycle accidents. This possibility forms the basis of ongoing research. Conclusion: This experiment was designed to evaluate the physiological significance of motorcycle impact-protective ensembles under close to worst-case conditions. The outcomes indicate that greater design attention is required to enhance dry and evaporative heat dissipation from clothing intended for summer use in hotter climates, but without compromising injury protection...|$|R

This is an {{open access}} article {{distributed}} under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. Aim. Single-access laparoscopic surgery (SALS) can be effective for benign and malignant diseases of the ileum in both the elective and urgent setting. Methods. Ten consecutive, nonselected patients with ileal disease requiring surgery over a twelve month period were included. All had a preoperative abdominopelvic computerized tomogram. Peritoneal access was achieved via a single transumbilical incision and a “surgical <b>glove</b> <b>port</b> ” utilized as our preferred access device. With the pneumoperitoneum established, the relevant ileal loop was located using standard rigid instruments. For ileal resection, anastomosis, or enterotomy, the site of pathology was delivered and addressed extracorporeally. Result. The median (range) age of the patients was 42. 5 (22 – 78) years, and the median body mass index was 22 (20. 2 – 28) kg/m 2. Procedures included tru-cut biopsy of an ileal mesenteric mass, loop ileostomy and ileotomy for impacted gallstone extraction as well as ileal (n = 3) and ileocaecal resection (n = 4). Mean (range) incision length was 2. 5 (2 – 5) cm. All convalescences were uncomplicated. Conclusions. These preliminary results show that SALS is an efficient and safe modality for the surgical management of ileal disease with all the advantages of minimal access surgery and without requiring {{a significant increase in}} theatre resource or cost or incurring extra patient morbidity. 1...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{report a}} single surgeon's {{experience}} with 109 laparoendoscopic single-site myomectomy (LESS-M) using conventional laparoscopic instruments and a homemade <b>glove</b> <b>port</b> system. Materials and methods: A total of 109 consecutive women who underwent LESS-M between March 2011 and April 2015 were reviewed. Results: The mean age and {{body mass index}} were 38. 3  ±  6. 5 years and 22. 1  ±  3. 0  kg/m 2. The mean diameter of the largest myoma and {{the mean number of}} myomas were 8. 1  ±  2. 4  cm and 1. 6  ±  0. 7. The mean weight of the myomas was 223. 2  ±  159. 7  g. The most common type of myoma was intramural (61 %), followed by subserosal (23 %), submucosal (9 %), and intraligamental (7 %). The most common site of the myomas was anterior (39 %), followed by posterior (38 %), lateral (15 %), and fundal (9 %). The mean operative time and estimated blood loss were 138. 5  ±  43. 8  min and 104. 9  ±  270. 1  mL. Two patients (1. 8 %) required intraoperative transfusion. The mean hospital stay was 2. 5  ±  0. 6 days. There were no conversions to laparotomy, but three patients(2. 8 %) were converted to two-port laparoscopic myomectomy. No patient experienced any major complication, including bowel, ureter, bladder injuries, or incisional hernia. Six women became pregnant after the operation, and five of these patients delivered their babies at full term by cesarean section. One patient delivered her baby at a gestational age at 32 weeks due to idiopathic polyhydramnios by cesarean section. One patient had the second pregnancy and delivery after LESS-M. Fourteen patients (12. 8 %) had small recurrent myomas that did not require treatment. Conclusion: LESS-M is a feasible alternative for patients with symptomatic myomas, and this technique can provide cosmetic advantages compared to conventional laparoscopic surgery...|$|E
40|$|At the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS), the D&D task is enormous. Tons of {{plutonium}} has been processed {{over the years}} in approximately 1, 000 gloveboxes, This represents nearly half of the gloveboxes in the DOE complex. In addition, more than a thousand tanks of various designs, with miles of associated piping, supported the processes. A wide variety of operations were performed at RFETS, including aqueous processing, pyrophoric processing, hydriding and dehydriding, metal casting, and machining {{of plutonium}}. Various materials have been handled at the facility, including plutonium, uranium, americium, tantalum, beryllium, chloride salts, and various acids and solvents. Significant amounts of plutonium residues remain in inaccessible equipment in the facilities, which create criticality safety issues. Some of the plutonium has been at RFETS for many years, and there is significant in-growth of americium, a decay product that emits gamma radiation, which potentially increases exposure to the workers. The size reduction portion of the D&D will be difficult and costly. The gloveboxes and tanks are constructed of stainless steel, frequently with lead shielding or double walls that hold water for neutron shielding. Window mountings, <b>glove</b> <b>port</b> rings, site gages, bolted flanges, and various penetrations reinforce the walls. Tanks may be filled with berated glass rings for criticality control, or double walled to hold the process fluid in the space between walls. The gloveboxes and tanks are generally tall enough to require workers to stand on scaffolding or platforms to perform D&D. Gloveboxes and tanks were individually constructed over a span of many years with evolving design specifications; therefore, most gloveboxes are unique and few tank designs are duplicated in more than pairs. This paper describes the cultural transition and technical approaches taken for D&D at RFETS to achieve 2006 closure. Specific emphasis is placed on critical issues such as, workforce safety and retention, strategies for schedule acceleration, and technological breakthroughs for D&D of nuclear facilities...|$|E
40|$|The United States Department of Energy (DOE) Complexes perform {{numerous}} {{hazardous material}} handling operations {{within the confines}} of a glovebox. The DOE is continuing to seek more efficient and safer means of handling these materials inside gloveboxes rather than the conventional, labor-intensive method through lead lined gloves. The use of glovebox automation technology will also be critical to the DOE in its efforts to comply with its mandated ALARA principles in handling the hazardous materials associated with the cleanup process. Operations associated with materials processing in a glovebox are similar to many industrial tasks, but the unique glovebox environment and Plutonium material properties create a unique set of challenges for conventional automation machinery. Such properties include: Low to moderate levels of ionizing radiation, high abrasiveness, corrosiveness, pyrophoric tendencies, rapid dispersal and permeation of environment, diffuses quickly, and possible incompatible material interaction. The glovebox presents the following challenges: existing gloveboxes may not be readily altered or even modified at all, complex mechanical operations for maintenance and repair are difficult or impossible through gloves, failed equipment may not be removed easily or at all. If a broken piece of equipment cannot be bagged-out through a <b>glove</b> <b>port</b> (approximately 216 mm (8 1 / 2 inch) diameter) it must remain in place. Broken equipment obstructs further operations. If it renders the entire glovebox unusable, a significant volume of waste is generated and an expensive system must be disposed of and replaced. A moderate sized glovebox alone costs between $ 250, 000 and $ 500, 000 and an equipment malfunction, which penetrates the glovebox and exposes the room to Plutonium or other toxic materials, is catastrophic. In addition to the human exposure issues, cleanup can easily run into the millions of dollars. A solution to the issues described above is ARM Automation Inc. 's (ARM) modular robotic manipulator technology developed for DOE EM operations, which addresses many of the issues discussed in the previous section. This manipulator system has the capability of custom configurations, which accommodate common glovebox tasks such as materials repackaging. The modular nature and quick connects of this system simplify installations into ''hot'' boxes and any potential modifications or repair therein. In the field of automation and robotics, a very common element is one used to generate motion for precise positioning of loads. One example of such an automation component would be an individual joint within an industrial robotic manipulator. This component consists of a tightly integrated package containing an electric motor, gear train, output support bearings, position sensors, brake, servo-amplifier and communications controller. Within the context of this paper, this key building block is referred to as an actuator module. With regard {{to the needs of the}} EM, [8] and [9] have shown that while each focus area has unique requirements for robotic automation at a system or manipulator level, their requirements at the actuator level are very similar. Thereby, a modular approach to automation which utilizes a small set of versatile actuator modules can be used to construct a broad range of robotic systems and automation cells suited to EM applications. By providing a pre-engineered, pre-integrated motion system to different robotics users within the DOE, new automation systems can be more quickly created without extensive expertise in motion control or the expense of building custom equipment...|$|E
