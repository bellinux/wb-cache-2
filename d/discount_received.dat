5000|$|The right digit effect {{focuses on}} the right digits of prices when the left digits are the same. [...] In other words, prices like $45 and $42 force {{consumers}} {{to pay more attention}} to the right digits (the 2 and 5) to determine the <b>discount</b> <b>received.</b> This effect also “implies that consumers will perceive larger discounts for prices with small right digit endings, than for large right digit endings. [...] For example, in a $32-to-$31 price reduction, consumers will believe to have received a greater deal than a $39-to-$38 price reduction. As a result, companies may use discounts with smaller right digits to mislead consumers into thinking they are receiving a better deal and increasing profit. However, consumers also are deceived by the infamous 9-ending prices. [...] “The right digit effect also relates to consumers’ tendency to identify 9-ending prices as sale (rather than regular) prices or to associate them with a discount. [...] For example, a regular price of $199 is mistakenly viewed as a sale or discount by consumers. Sales companies most commonly use this approach because the misinterpretation of consumers usually results in an increase of sales and profit.|$|E
40|$|Different {{types of}} {{discounts}} {{for the price}} of a product are quite common in transactions. They are frequently used by industrial enterprises as well: they <b>receive</b> <b>discounts</b> when they purchase production inventories; they offer discounts when they sell the finished product. Industrial enterprise strive to minimize costs when purchasing raw materials necessary for manufacturing and therefore it is interested in acquiring a discount from supplier. Acquiring a discount is a fact of economic life and must be registered in financial accounts of an enterprise, however nowadays the patterns of accounting of such operations are not regulated by any special normative documents and traditionally applied accounting patterns do not contain information on the amounts of <b>received</b> <b>discounts.</b> It is happening because they comply with the current rules of accounting, according to which inventories are accounted only after deduction of the <b>received</b> <b>discount</b> (so the discount is granted in form of verbal agreement). This is a precursor to the lack of data on the <b>received</b> <b>discounts</b> in financial accounting system of an industrial enterprise, to the impossibility of creation the information base for analyzing the effectiveness of the <b>received</b> <b>discounts</b> on its basis, to the violation of the principle of completeness and continuity of registering all the economic life events in accounting. The article offers the already existing variants of financial accounting of the <b>received</b> <b>discounts,</b> analyzes its advantages and disadvantages from the point of view of compliance with the current legislative system and economic contents of discount operation.

40|$|In this work, we {{examined}} the surprising value consumers attach to getting a bargain. Past research has largely understood this phenomenon {{in terms of the}} impact discounts have on perceptions of fairness. However, the evidence for this explanation is inconclusive due to a number of viable alternatives as well as issues relating to construct and external validity. The experiments we report here provide clearer evidence for the basic assertion that discounts increase purchase satisfaction due to the nonfinancial rewards that are associated with perceptions of fairness. Furthermore, current notions of fairness in the promotion literature are extended by showing that social cues such as the relative size of the <b>discount</b> <b>received</b> by another customer and the loyalty status of that customer can also have an important impact on fairness and purchase satisfaction. We suggest an integration of transaction utility theory (Thaler, 1985) and equity theory (Bagozzi, 1975) to account for these findings. Everybody seems to like getting a bargain. From an economic standpoint, the appeal can be understood in terms of the objective monetary benefits. However, simple observation suggests that bargains may be of broader significance t...|$|E
40|$|In this report, I {{assess the}} {{application}} of the 2007 Sentencing Guidelines Council guideline, Reductions for a Guilty Plea, empirically using data collected on the Sentencing Council’s Crown Court Sentencing Survey in the year 2011. I begin by using an exploratory analysis to observe the relationship between the level of discount applied and the stage at which the guilty plea was entered. I then consider the possible impact of other factors taken into account when sentencing on the reduction applied for a guilty plea. For this, I specify different models for discrete data to regress the level of discount on a broad set of explanatory variables. Results point towards a substantial degree of agreement between the recommendations provided in the 2007 guideline and the actual level of <b>discount</b> <b>received</b> by offenders who plead guilty. In particular, the stage based approach recommended in the 2007 guideline was found to be the major factor determining the level of discount applied. However, the results also show there to be a number of departures from the guideline, such as: a) a high proportion of cases where the reduction given was higher than the maximum recommended level of 33 %, with these anomalies concentrated in specific Courts; b) the presence of particular aggravating factors, on average, leading to lower levels of discount after controlling for the stage when the guilty plea was entered; and c) the presence of the mitigating factor remorse, on average, having a positive significant effect on the level of discount...|$|E

The paper offers some clues to the determinants of this stylised fact exploiting the answers of about 1900 manufacturing firms {{on a wide range}} of contractual features, separately for domestic and foreign counterparties. The main finding is that, with the almost totality of commercial transactions made on credit, there is no evidence that trade credit is more expensive than loans. An econometric investigation shows that discounts offered have the expected effect of reducing payment delays only for customers located abroad, where customary credit periods are shorter. The result is consistent with the poor explanatory power of the <b>discounts</b> <b>received</b> for the trade debt period of domestic firms and with the evidence of larger buyers willing to exploit their market power with suppliers.

Results suggest that spatial price <b>discounts</b> <b>received</b> by western ranchers closely match reported shipping costs and, thus, are consistent with free-on-board pricing and competitive procurement. This study also identifies the presence of temporal price premiums, on average, for seller-offered forward contracts at video auctions. With respect to quality attributes, this study provides estimates of the marginal value associated with various quality attributes and management practices, including vaccination protocols, weaning, certified Angus beef candidates, and age and source verification. Finally, we show that the considerable year-to-year variability in estimated valuations for value-added attributes in hedonic regression models of cattle pricing {{can be linked to}} the stage of the cattle cycle, with premiums paid by buyers being attenuated when cattle inventories are high...|$|R
