5|$|Lewis {{argues that}} Applewhite {{effectively}} controlled his followers by packaging his teachings in familiar terms. Richard Hecht of the University of California, Santa Barbara, echoes this sentiment, arguing {{that members of}} the group killed themselves because they believed the narrative that he had constructed, rather than because he psychologically controlled them. In his 2000 study of apocalyptic movements, John R. Hall posits that they were motivated to commit suicide because they saw <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate that they had conquered the fear of death and truly believed Applewhite.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Levesque's {{role as an}} Executive Senior Advisor {{was officially}} formalized as he was given an office at WWE {{headquarters}} in Stamford, Connecticut. Levesque was named Executive Vice President, Talent and Live events in 2011. In this role he oversees the talent relations and talent development departments, training of performers and management of worldwide recruitment. Levesque's role within {{the company has been}} under much criticism since 2003, as many fans and some wrestlers view <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> keep him on top on-screen and to give him more television time. Levesque has spoken against this criticism and has denied all of it. Additionally, Levesque has been credited for losing in high-profile matches that helped elevate the careers of younger wrestlers including John Cena, Randy Orton, Batista, Jeff Hardy, Brock Lesnar, Daniel Bryan and Roman Reigns.|$|E

5|$|In early March 1705 the Russian Field Marshal Boris Sheremetyev set up {{a meeting}} with the Saxon general Otto Arnold von Paykull in order to agree to a common course of action in the ensuing campaign. The basis for the {{strategy}} was a plan developed by Johann Patkul as early as 1703, which envisioned a joint strike which would neutralize the Swedish army. von Paykull, inspired by Patkul's blueprint, advocated <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> lure Charles and the main Swedish army out of Greater Poland eastward towards Brest-Litovsk. This was to be accomplished by having the combined forces of the main Russian army under Ogilvy and von Paykull's troops stationed at Brest, which would force Charles to meet them in battle. At the same time the main Saxon army would attack Charles from the rear by sweeping through Poland out of Saxony, ultimately catching the Swedish army exposed. The plan seemed rather daring to Patkul and he suggested that the allies should first crush Lewenhaupt's army, before Ogilvy's troops approached Charles. Otherwise Ogilvy's rear would be threatened. A compromise was made between the two strategies and it was decided that Sheremetyev should engage Lewenhaupt {{at the same time as}} Ogilvy marched towards the strongly fortified city of Grodno. The belief was that there, behind fortifications, Oglivy would be able to withstand Charles long enough for the main Saxon army to arrive from Kraków. Meanwhile, von Paykull would attack with his combined Saxon–Polish force towards Warsaw in order to interrupt the coronation of Stanisław I.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} massacre, in 1851-1852, four Indian {{reservations}} were opened {{up by the}} United States government in California; the Pomo Indians saw <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> retain certain aspects of their cultural heritage.|$|E
25|$|For Dearborn, who {{recently}} suffered defeat as a Republican gubernatorial candidate, the controversy {{provided an opportunity}} to regain political prominence, while Federalists saw <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> besmirch Dearborn, embrace Putnam, and regain lost political favor for their party.|$|E

25|$|March {{organizers}} themselves disagreed {{over the}} purpose of the march. The NAACP and Urban League saw <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> gesture of support for a civil rights bill that had been introduced by the Kennedy Administration. Randolph, King, and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) saw <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of raising both civil rights and economic issues to national attention beyond the Kennedy bill. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) saw <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of challenging and condemning the Kennedy administration's inaction and lack of support for civil rights for African Americans.|$|R

25|$|Consequently, {{the very}} {{features}} that made Bermuda such a prized {{base for the}} Royal Navy (its headquarters in the North Atlantic and West Indies 'til after the Second World War, also meant it was perpetually threatened by US invasion, as the US {{would have liked to}} both deny the base to an enemy, and use <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> extend its defences hundreds of miles out to sea, which would not happen 'til the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|In June 2008, WWE {{changed its}} TV Parental Guidelines rating from TV-14 to TV-PG.

25|$|Since Buddhist {{practice}} also encompasses practical wisdom, spiritual {{virtues and}} morality, it cannot {{be said to}} be just another form of psychotherapy. It is more accurate to see <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of life or <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of being (Dharma).|$|R

25|$|Across {{town from}} Posey, Gus Greenlee, a reputed gangster and numbers runner, had just {{purchased}} the Pittsburgh Crawfords. Greenlee's main interest in baseball {{was to use}} <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> launder money from his numbers games. But, after learning about Posey's money-making machine in Homestead, he became obsessed with the sport and his Crawfords. On August 6, 1931, Satchel Paige made his first appearance as a Crawford. With Paige on his team, Greenlee took a huge risk by investing $100,000 in a new ballpark to be called Greenlee Field. On opening day, April 30, 1932, the pitcher-catcher battery {{was made up of}} the two most marketable icons in all of blackball: Satchel Paige and Josh Gibson.|$|E
25|$|M'ba did {{not have}} an idealist vision of his job; he saw <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> become wealthy. With his {{colleague}} Ambamamy, he forced labour on the residents of the canton for his personal use, to cover his large expenditures. The colonial administration was aware of the embezzlement, but they chose to overlook it. However, beginning in 1929, the colonial administration started to investigate his activities after they intercepted one of his letters to a Kouyaté, secretary for the Ligue des droits de l'homme, who was accused of being an ally of the Comintern. Despite this suspected Communist alliance, the French authorities did not oppose M'ba's appointment as head chief of the Estuaire Province by his colleagues.|$|E

Traditionalists, however, complained about Poedjangga Baroe modernization of Malay; Marah Sutan, chairman of the Malay-language Teachers Board, stated that it betrayed the [...] "purity of High Malay and its traditional poetic forms". Traditionalists also decried the introduction of loanwords to Malay from regional and foreign languages to increase the Indonesian lexicon and the deviation from traditional pantuns and syairs. Other Malay figures against the publication included Agus Salim, S.M. Latif, and Sutan Mohamad Zain.|$|E

50|$|This ‘twist’ in {{the trial}} was inconsequential. Abdul Majud never testified in court.

500|$|Game {{designer}} Mohammad Alavi {{was heavily}} involved in the level's development, from programming the artificial intelligence to directing the motion capture used for the character animations. Alavi noted that he never intended for [...] "No Russian" [...] to attract controversy or {{be seen as a}} political statement, but instead developed <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> progress the game's narrative. He wanted the level to fulfill three tasks: explain why Russia would invade the United States, have the player make an emotional connection with Makarov, and do it in a [...] "memorable and engaging way". Alavi did not interview victims of real terrorist attacks, but instead drew inspiration from news articles and films.|$|E
500|$|Finally, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) {{learns that}} Sheinhardt Universal—the fictional owner of General Electric—is {{producing}} a biographical film on singer Janis Joplin, and {{she decides to}} audition for <b>it.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> get the role, she goes into Jack's office in character.

Much to her dismay, Jenna learns that actress Julia Roberts and director Martin Scorsese are also making a Janis Joplin movie and that Sheinhardt Universal has yet to secure the song and image rights of Joplin. In order {{for the company to}} avoid legal problems, Jenna is introduced as [...] "Janet Jopler" [...] on TGS—the show she stars in—and sings the song [...] "Piece of My Heart" [...] but with reworded lyrics.|$|E
500|$|This [...] "system" [...] {{is still}} {{controversial}} to many guests. Some view <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> cut lines by paying extra money. Ironically Cedar Point {{did have a}} similar system in the early 2000s(first called Ticket to Ride and then FreeWay), but has in 2004 discontinued it because they were charged with [...] "sanctioning line-jumping". This Fast Pass is the updated version {{which is supposed to}} be less problematic for other guests, even though the general idea is the same. It is a way to make lines shorter only for the people with the Pass. The other guests in line actually get a longer wait time because the Fast Pass individuals may get on the ride a few times in the same duration of one normal wait time.|$|E

Shawn talks with Lacey Maxwell (Christine Chatelain), the sister of the groom, who asks him to get her bouquet from a locked cooler, but he can't. Before the wedding, the bouquets are passed out, and Lacey panics when hers isn't there. Lacey reveals she is a magician when she helps to calm down the flower girl. Shawn realizes who stole the ring and killed Manheim, but his realization occurs in the middle of the ceremony. Shawn interrupts the wedding with a [...] "psychic episode", and exposes Lacey to everyone.|$|E
500|$|Whether {{the move}} to America was Julius's idea or his son's is unknown. A leading Florida {{property}} firm had branches in several English cities including Bradford; in an article on Delius's time in Florida, William Randel conjectures that either Julius Delius visited the Bradford office and conceived the notion of sending his wayward son to grow oranges in Florida, or that Fritz himself saw <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> escape the hated family wool business and suggested the idea to his father. Delius was in Florida from the spring of 1884 to the autumn of 1885, living on a plantation at Solano Grove (...) between Picolata and Tocoi on the Saint Johns River, about 35 miles (55 kilometers) south of Jacksonville. He continued to be engrossed in music, and in Jacksonville he met Thomas Ward, who became his teacher in counterpoint and composition. Delius later said that Ward's teaching was the only useful music instruction he ever had.|$|E
500|$|In 1990, the {{managing}} director of London Weekend Television (LWT), Greg Dyke, met with {{the representatives of the}} [...] "big five" [...] football clubs in England (Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham, Everton and Arsenal) over a dinner. [...] The meeting was {{to pave the way for}} a break away from The Football League. Dyke believed that it would be more lucrative for LWT if only the larger clubs in the country were featured on national television and wanted to establish whether the clubs would be interested in a larger share of television rights money. The five clubs decided it was a good idea and decided to press ahead with it; however, the league would have no credibility without the backing of The Football Association and so David Dein of Arsenal held talks to see whether the FA were receptive to the idea. The FA did not enjoy an amicable relationship with the Football League at the time and considered <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> weaken the Football League's position.|$|E
50|$|Another two {{wings of}} the jail were {{demolished}} after India achieved independence.
