50|$|Alternative {{trading system}} (ATS) is a US and Canadian {{regulatory}} term <b>for</b> <b>a</b> non-exchange <b>trading</b> <b>venue</b> that matches {{buyers and sellers}} to find counterparties for transactions. Alternative trading systems are typically regulated as broker-dealers rather than as exchanges (although <b>an</b> alternative <b>trading</b> system can apply to be regulated as a securities exchange). In general, <b>for</b> regulatory purposes <b>an</b> alternative <b>trading</b> system is <b>an</b> organization or system that provides or maintains a market place or facilities for bringing together purchasers and sellers of securities, but does not set rules for subscribers (other than rules {{for the conduct of}} subscribers trading on the system). An ATS must be approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and is an alternative to a traditional stock exchange. The equivalent term under European legislation is <b>a</b> multilateral <b>trading</b> facility (MTF).|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> {{multilateral}} <b>trading</b> facility (MTF) is a European regulatory term <b>for</b> <b>a</b> self-regulated financial <b>trading</b> <b>venue.</b> These are {{alternatives to}} the traditional stock exchanges where a market is made in securities, typically using electronic systems. The operation of a MTF is considered an investment service. The concept was introduced within the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), a European Directive designed to harmonise retail investors protection and allow investment firms to provide services throughout the EU. Article 4 (15) of MiFID describes MTF as multilateral system, operated by an investment firm or a market operator, which brings together multiple third-party buying and selling interests in financial instruments - {{in the system and}} in accordance with non-discretionary rules - in a way that results in a contract. The term 'non-discretionary rules' means that the investment firm operating an MTF has no discretion as to how interests may interact. Interests are brought together by forming a contract and the execution takes place under the system's rules or by means of the system's protocols or internal operating procedures. The MTF can be operated by a market operator or an investment firm whereas the operation of a regulated market is not considered an investment service and is carried out exclusively by market operators that are authorised to do so. The United States equivalent is <b>an</b> alternative <b>trading</b> system.|$|R

40|$|Dark {{pools of}} {{liquidity}} are receiving increasing {{attention from the}} media and regulators. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>trading</b> <b>venue</b> mainly <b>for</b> large institutional investors, dark pools offer liquidity and protection from front-running and other predatory tactics used by high-speed trading outfits that result in poor trade execution. However, those institutional investors who use dark pools, referred to herein as dark pool subscribers, are now finding themselves the victims of misconduct within and by dark pools. Moreover, this misconduct is matched with almost no viable recourse, either in statutory or common law, for dark pool subscribers. This paper {{is divided into three}} main Parts. Part I provides background on how and why modern dark pools came to exist, how they currently function, and how they are and are not regulated. Part II describes the cases of eBX, LLC and Pipeline Trading Systems LLC as examples of some of the risks that face dark pool subscribers. Part III explains the lack of and need <b>for</b> <b>a</b> remedy <b>for</b> subscribers in cases like those in Part II and proposes that a tailored fiduciary relationship between dark pool managers and subscribers is that remedy...|$|R

5000|$|The order {{protection}} {{rule has}} been controversial {{because it requires}} traders to transact on <b>a</b> <b>trading</b> <b>venue</b> at the lowest price rather than on a venue offering the quickest execution or the most reliability. Thus, some have described it as an improper government intervention into private business affairs. Defenders of the rule argue that it really just requires what brokers should be doing if they are acting in their customer's best interests. [...] Still others {{have argued that the}} rule is too lax because it only protects the quotes {{at the top of the}} book. [...] For example, if the best two quotes in one market are superior to the best quote in another market, a portion of an incoming market order may still trade at the inferior market at the inferior price even though the second best quote on the superior market is still available. If more than just the top of the book (the best quote) were protected by the order rule, the market order would have transacted at a superior price and the limit order offering the superior price would have transacted more quickly.|$|R

40|$|This {{work has}} been {{supported}} by a Leverhulme Trust Research Fellowship (RF- 2016 - 078) This report offers a narrative, ‘historical sociology’ of two markets established in London in 1995 {{in response to a}} series of rule changes at the London Stock Exchange (LSE). The first, the Alternative Investment Market, or AIM, was set up by the LSE. It was established as part of LSE chief executive Michael Lawrence’s ‘seven-point plan’ for the repositioning of the Exchange as <b>an</b> engine <b>for</b> economic growth focused on the UK regions. AIM was also, in part, a reactive move allowing the Exchange to deal with competitive threats in Europe and at home, particularly growing activity under its own Rule 535. It has acted as <b>a</b> proving ground <b>for</b> many smaller companies and {{plays an important role in}} the political positioning of the LSE. The second, OFEX (renamed PLUS in 2004) was privately operated and driven by commercial demand. Originally operated as <b>a</b> <b>trading</b> facility, it achieved legal recognition as a ‘designated market’ in 2001, and then as a Recognized Investment Exchange (RIE) in 2007. As OFEX it coexisted with the LSE and rode the dotcom wave; as PLUS it served as <b>a</b> vehicle <b>for</b> <b>a</b> market rebellion against the LSE. It struggled to maintain a commitment to its original small company constituency and to compete as <b>a</b> <b>trading</b> <b>venue</b> of choice against the Exchange. While AIM has flourished, PLUS faltered after the financial crisis of 2008, and my narrative finishes in 2012 with the sale of the PLUS RIE licence to ICAP, now NEX. Publisher PD...|$|R
