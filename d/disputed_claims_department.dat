40|$|We {{describe}} Dispute Finder, a browser extension that alerts a user when {{information they}} read online is disputed by a source {{that they might}} trust. Dispute Finder examines the text on the page that the user is browsing and highlights any phrases that resemble known <b>disputed</b> <b>claims.</b> If a user clicks on a highlighted phrase then Dispute Finder shows them a list of articles that support other points of view. Dispute Finder builds a database of known <b>disputed</b> <b>claims</b> by crawling web sites that already maintain lists of <b>disputed</b> <b>claims,</b> and by allowing users to enter claims that they believe are disputed. Dispute Finder identifies snippets that make known <b>disputed</b> <b>claims</b> by running a simple textual entailment algorithm inside the browser extension, referring to a cached local copy of the claim database. In this paper, we explain the design of Dispute Finder, and the trade-offs between the various design decisions that we explored.
