2500|$|Levin {{was known}} for his refusal to give {{interviews}}. In one of the few interviews that he gave {{at the beginning of his}} career (to Michael Handelsalz from Israel Defense Forces Radio), he answered the question [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> specifically for the theater?": ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{a lecture}} on {{autobiography}} and fiction, Franzen discussed four perennial questions often asked to him by audiences, all of which annoy him or bother him in some way. These are: (1) Who are your influences? (2) What time of day do you work, and what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> on? (3) I read an interview with an author who says that, {{at a certain point}} in writing a novel, the characters [...] "take over" [...] and tell him what to do. Does this happen to you, too? (4) Is your fiction autobiographical? In the lecture he said of the third question in particular [...] "This one always raises my blood pressure" [...] and quoted Nabokov in response.|$|E
2500|$|Bukowski died {{of leukemia}} on March 9, 1994, in San Pedro, aged 73, shortly after {{completing}} his last novel, Pulp. The funeral rites, orchestrated by his widow, {{were conducted by}} Buddhist monks. He is interred at Green Hills Memorial Park in Rancho Palos Verdes. An account of the proceedings {{can be found in}} Gerald Locklin's book Charles Bukowski: A Sure Bet. His gravestone reads: [...] "Don't Try", a phrase which Bukowski uses in one of his poems, advising aspiring writers and poets about inspiration and creativity. Bukowski explained the phrase in a 1963 letter to John William Corrington: [...] "Somebody at one of these places [...] asked me: 'What do you do? How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>write,</b> create?' You don't, I told them. You don't try. That's very important: not to try, either for Cadillacs, creation or immortality. You wait, and if nothing happens, you wait some more. It's like a bug high on the wall. You wait for it to come to you. When it gets close enough you reach out, slap out and kill it. Or if you like its looks you make a pet out of it." [...] Bukowski was an atheist.|$|E

6000|$|... "When <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> to Colonel Brandon, ma'am?" [...] was {{an inquiry}} which sprung from the impatience {{of her mind}} to have {{something}} going on.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nobody {{has so much}} {{influence}} with Frank as I. Just <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> to me to-morrow, and the next day,--and the day after,--a mere line, you know, {{to tell me how}} the land lies here." ...|$|E
6000|$|DORA. And what harm {{will that}} <b>do</b> <b>you,</b> so that <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not copy his bad manners? Go, child. (Exit MILLY.) But, Eva, why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> 'Seek {{me at the}} bottom of the river'? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But, Edward, what's that, what's that!' she cried, in an {{agony of}} reproach. 'Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> leave me {{to return to}} her? Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> me that cruel, cruel letter that nearly killed me!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{on earth}} <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> to him?" [...] exclaimed Euphemia. [...] "You mustn't go {{on a bit}} further until you have told what was in your letter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> it?" [...] {{the mother}} asked, awkward {{now she was}} touched. Ursula spelled out her name. The man looked at the woman. A bright, {{confused}} flush came over the mother's face, a sort of luminous shyness.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{has that}} to do with it? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> over to Lady Laura and the old lord {{and tell them that}} if she'll {{undertake}} to be at Loughlinter within a month this shall be suppressed. Will you do that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Answer me this, at all events," [...] {{said the}} Angel, with more dignity, if possible: [...] "How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> your books? For {{it must be}} {{wonderful}} to summon around you every day the creatures of your imagination. Do you wait for afflatus?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Henchard {{seemed to}} take the seat offered, {{and in a moment}} he resumed: [...] "Well, first I should ask, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> this?" [...] A {{rustling}} of paper followed.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What? I know, Mary; {{his letters}} kept me in a {{perpetual}} fright {{for the last}} year; and not one <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> to poor little Clara to comfort us.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{shook her}} head with a finer deeper wisdom. [...] "You're not ready. If you're ready why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> to Mrs. Newsome in the sense you've {{mentioned}} to me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean {{it to be}} love, and I'm {{not going}} to be put off by Serjeant Bluestone. We must get to the lady by some other means. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> to that tailor down at Keswick, and say that you want to see him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Women expect such {{a lot of}} letter-writing! But I {{have been}} remiss I know. I got out of my {{business}} {{way of doing things}} when I came down here and have neglected it. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> to her to-morrow, and tell her that she shall hear from me directly I get back to town." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye--I {{dare say}} it is {{different}} from what we would have it; French spelling being no great matter in general. Put it as you please; though Nelson has as great a contempt for their boasted philosophy and learning as I have myself. I fancy you will find all the English spelt right. How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> their confounded gibberish?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> {{to tell me}} that I {{ought to}} come as he was not at all well?" [...] she inquired, with a lifting of her {{delicate}} eyebrows.|$|R
6000|$|When I {{first had}} the privilege—and I count {{it a very}} high one—of meeting Mr. Walter Pater, he said to me, smiling, ‘Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> always <b>write</b> poetry? Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>write</b> prose? Prose {{is so much more}} difficult.’ ...|$|R

6000|$|... "What now? Are you {{a subject}} for the mad hospital?" [...] said the wine-shop keeper, {{crossing}} the road, and obliterating the jest {{with a handful of}} mud, picked up for the purpose, and smeared over it. [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> in the public streets? Is there--tell me thou--is there no other place to write such words in?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; Lord Ongar's {{people want}} to know whether she can be induced to give up the place; that is, to sell her {{interest}} in it. I have promised to see her. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> her a letter first, and tell her that I want to see her; and ask her also to come here as soon as she can leave London." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing of {{any great}} consequence. I didn't {{know whether he}} might have told you. I'll write down by to-night's post, and then he can meet me at Barchester to-morrow. Or <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>write.</b> There's nothing I hate so much as letter-writing; just tell him that I called, and that I shall be much obliged if he can {{meet me at the}} Dragon of Wantly--say at two to-morrow. I will go down by the express." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why," [...] say I, lapsing {{into the}} Italian rhetorical manner, [...] "why {{do you keep}} an inn? Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> the word Ristorante so large, when {{you have nothing to}} offer people, and don't intend to have anything. Why do you have the impudence to take in travellers?

6000|$|Now, I shall {{leave at}} mid-night tonight, alone and on foot {{for a walk}} of 60 or 70 miles through a totally {{uninhabited}} country, and it is barely possible that mail facilities may prove infernally [...] "slow" [...] during the few weeks I expect to spend out there.

60|$|If the counting-house of Chicksey, Veneering, and Stobbles {{had ever}} been shut up by three happier people, glad as most people were to shut it up, {{they must have been}} superlatively happy indeed. But first Bella mounted upon Rumty's Perch, and said, 'Show me what you do here all day long, dear Pa. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> like this?' laying her round cheek upon her plump left arm, and losing sight of her pen in waves of hair, in a highly unbusiness-like manner. Though John Rokesmith seemed to like it.|$|E
6000|$|... "You've a {{right to}} my forbearance, and not only that, but to my--my life; to {{everything}} that I am," [...] cried Dan, in a quiver of tenderness {{at the sight of}} her and the sound of her voice.
