5|$|According to Citizenship and Immigration Canada, {{there are}} three main classifications for immigrants: Family class (persons closely related to Canadian residents), Economic class (admitted {{on the basis of}} a point system that {{accounts}} for age, health and labour-market skills required for cost effectively inducting the immigrants into Canada's labour market) and Refugee class (those seeking protection by applying to remain in the country by way of the Canadian immigration and refugee law). In 2008, there were 65,567 immigrants in the family class, 21,860 refugees, and 149,072 economic immigrants amongst the 247,243 total <b>immigrants</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> country.

5|$|The Upper Peninsula of Michigan. In some areas, pasties are a {{significant}} tourist attraction, including an annual Pasty Fest in Calumet, Michigan in late June.

Many ethnic groups adopted the pasty {{for use in the}} Copper Country copper mines; the Finnish <b>immigrants</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> region mistook it for the traditional piiraat and kuuko pastries. The pasty has become strongly associated with all cultures in this area, and in the similar Iron Range in northern Minnesota.|$|E
5|$|There {{are eight}} circles, or roundabouts, that span and connect west Amman. Successive waves of <b>immigrants</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city {{has led to}} the rapid {{construction}} of new neighborhoods, but Amman's capacity for new or widened roads remains limited despite the influx. This has resulted in increasing traffic jams, particularly during summer when there are large numbers of tourists and Jordanian expatriates visiting. The municipality began construction on a bus rapid transit (BRT) system as a solution in 2015. In 2015, a ring road encompassing the city was constructed, which aims to connect the northern and southern parts of the city in order for traffic to be diverted outside Amman and to improve the environmental conditions in the city.|$|E

In 2011, Serbia was ranked second in the world (after Guinea Bissau) in human capital flight according to USAID.

5|$|Wine {{has been}} {{produced}} in Oregon since the Oregon Territory was {{settled in the}} 1840s; however, winemaking has only been a significant industry in the state since the 1960s. Grapes were first planted in the Oregon Territory in 1847. Valley View,the first recorded winery, was established by Peter Britt in the late 1850s in Jacksonville. Throughout the 19th century, there was experimentation with various varietals by <b>immigrants</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> state. In 1904, an Oregon winemaker won a prize at the St. Louis World's Fair. Wine production stopped in the United States during Prohibition. As in other states, the Oregon wine industry lay dormant for thirty years after Prohibition was repealed.|$|E
5|$|By 2006, the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas {{managed to}} defeat {{the forces of the}} Sinaloa Cartel in Nuevo Laredo. The latter cartel {{concentrated}} its efforts in northeastern Mexico, becoming dominant there. Los Zetas started to expand into other criminal activities beyond drug trafficking. Under Treviño Morales, the organization smuggled <b>immigrants</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States, carried out extortions and kidnappings, sold bootlegged CDs and DVDs, and intimidated and/or killed residents who failed to cooperate with them. Treviño Morales remained in charge of Los Zetas in the state of Nuevo León and in Piedras Negras, Coahuila, until March 2007. He was reassigned to the coastal state of Veracruz, shortly after high-ranking Zetas leader Efraín Teodoro Torres (alias Z-14) was killed in a gun battle at a local horse race. Though Cárdenas Guillén was imprisoned in 2003, he reportedly directed the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas behind bars; when he was extradited to the United States in 2007, Treviño Morales and Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano pushed for Los Zetas' independence from the Gulf Cartel.|$|E

5|$|Stories of Leif's {{journey to}} North America had a {{profound}} effect on the identity and self-perception of later Nordic Americans and Nordic <b>immigrants</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States. The first statue of Leif (by Anne Whitney) was erected in Boston in 1887 at the instigation of Eben Norton Horsford, who was among those who believed that Vinland could have been located on the Charles River or Cape Cod; not long after, another casting of Whitney's statue was erected in Milwaukee. A statue was also erected in Chicago in 1901, having been originally commissioned for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition to coincide with the arrival of the reconstructed Viking ship from Bergen, Norway. Another work of art made for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, the painting Leiv Eiriksson oppdager Amerika by Christian Krohg, was in the possession of a Leif Erikson Memorial Association in Chicago before being given back to the National Gallery of Norway in 1900.|$|E
5|$|While {{the key to}} Albany's {{economic}} prosperity in the 19th century was transportation, industry and business also played a role. Largely thanks to the city's Dutch and German roots, beer was one of its biggest commodities. Beverwyck Brewery, originally known as Quinn and Nolan (Nolan being mayor of Albany 1878–1883), was the last remaining brewer from that time when it closed in 1972. The city's location at {{the east end of}} the Erie Canal gave it unparalleled access to both raw products and a captive customer base in the west. Albany was known for its publishing houses, and to some extent, still is. Albany was second only to Boston in the number of books produced for most of the 19th century. Iron foundries in both the north and south ends of the city brought thousands of <b>immigrants</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city. To this day, one can see many intricate wrought-iron details on older buildings. The iron industry waned by the 1890s due to increased costs associated with a newly unionized workforce and the opening of mines in the Mesabi Range in Minnesota.|$|E
