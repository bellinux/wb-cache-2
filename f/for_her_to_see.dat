I worked up on another idea and brought {{together}} a featured band <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> I did it all in front of me. [...] In retrospect, it feels good, the video we have done much better suited to the track than the first ideas. [...] has an incredible track on everything she is doing. Style, music, business— she has a mental track of every single thing and won't give up until she is completely satisfied. And on music videos there is nothing she does {{with one hand on}} her back— she's engaged to one hundred percent.|$|E
500|$|Built by the Kaiserliche Werft {{at their}} {{shipyard}} in Wilhelmshaven, Hindenburg {{was the third}} and final ship of her class; her sister ships were [...] and [...] Designed as a replacement for the elderly protected cruiser , Hindenburgs keel was laid down on 30June 1913. She was launched on 1August 1915, but due to shifting construction priorities in time of war, she was not completed until 10May 1917, by which time it was too late <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> any significant operations in World War I. At the time, British naval intelligence believed the ship was commissioned so late because she had had parts removed to repair Derfflinger after the battle of Jutland in June 1916. In actuality, construction proceeded slowly because of labor shortages.|$|E
500|$|During the Wyntoon {{residency}} of Hearst and Davies, {{they received}} fewer visitors {{than they had}} at San Simeon, because it was more remote. They spent much time together, and Davies picked up sewing again after years of no practice. She sewed silk fabric into ties for Hearst. He wrote her a poem or a short note every night, which he slipped under her door <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> in the morning. Over the 1943–1944 winter, with snow and ice transforming the outdoor scenery, Wyntoon hosted actor Clark Gable, film directors Louis B. Mayer and Raoul Walsh, columnist Louella Parsons, cartoonist Jimmy Swinnerton and his wife, aviator Charles Lindbergh and his family, the former president's daughter Anna Roosevelt and her husband John Boettiger (who worked for Hearst), and millionaire industrialist Joe Kennedy who brought his 26-year-old son [...] "Jack", the future president. Jack surprised Hearst by swimming in the freezing McCloud.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] she said, [...] "it {{will be just}} as well <b>for</b> <b>her</b> not <b>to</b> <b>see</b> so much of June. She's such {{a decided}} character, dear June!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Sakuya behaves {{very much}} like a modern {{teenager}} and is fashion conscious. She would love <b>for</b> <b>her</b> brother <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> as a woman and not just a sister.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{leave her}} with you," [...] {{he whispered to}} the eldest Miss Evans. [...] "It will be better <b>for</b> <b>her</b> not <b>to</b> <b>see</b> me until she is quite recovered. She has had a shock." ...|$|R
500|$|Mike is {{hurt when}} new love {{interest}} Bronwyn Davies (Rachel Friend) {{chose to be}} with Henry Ramsay (Craig McLachlan). He incorrectly believes he and Jane {{have a chance of}} reconciling because when Jane and Des share a meal to discuss Mike, but Jane believed Des had invited her with romantic intentions in mind. Des does feel drawn to Jane and Jones told Darren Devlyn from the magazine that her character is [...] "really upset" [...] when Des wants to discuss Mike. Jane is nearly hit by a car and this makes Des realise that he is in love with Jane and asks her to marry him. Mike is left feeling worse that both women in his life have chosen other men. Jones told Devlyn that Des' friends still believe he is attached to the memory of his late wife Daphne Clarke (Elaine Smith). She explained that because of Daphne [...] "it's natural that the proposal comes as a big shock." [...] Both characters had been left emotionally damaged from previous relationships but Jones believed the duo had no hesitations once they made the commitment. The actress added [...] "it's great that Des is finally over his mourning." [...] She was also looking forward to her character taking the role of step-mother to Jamie. It was interesting <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how Jane copes with the responsibility of looking after a child. Keane was happy with the storyline because he believed it was time for Des to move on. He was also excited to work more closely alongside Jones on the storyline.|$|E
2500|$|Several Brooklyns {{were seriously}} damaged during the war, {{but all of}} the cruisers survived. [...] was {{severely}} damaged by shell hit in her forward turret magazine during the Battle of Cape Esperance on 11 October 1942, suffering many casualties but luckily the magazine (being partially flooded as a result of shell hits in her hull) did not explode. [...] was hit by a kamikaze attack on 13 December 1944 off Mindoro which killed or wounded 310 crewmen. [...] was torpedoed at the Battle of Kolombangara on July 12–13, 1943, as was her near-sister [...] After being repaired in the United States, Honolulu returned to service only to be torpedoed by a Japanese aircraft on 20 October 1944 during the invasion of Leyte. On 11 September 1943 [...] was hit by a German Fritz X radio guided bomb which penetrated her #3 turret and blew out the bottom of the ship. Skillful damage control by her crew saved her from sinking. While under repair in the United States, Savannah and Honolulu were rebuilt with a bulged hull that increased their beam by nearly 8 feet and their 5-inch guns were reinstalled as four twins, though the repairs to Honolulu were completed too late <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> action again.|$|E
60|$|I sent <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{me in my}} room, {{and showed}} her my letter.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{says she}} cannot come down. You know she means it, Master, {{and it is}} of no use <b>to</b> coax <b>her.</b> And I must say I think she is right. Since she will not marry you it is better <b>for</b> <b>her</b> not <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you." ...|$|R
60|$|At length, when he {{got pretty}} near her, he called out <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> stop and <b>see</b> what she had made him do.|$|R
5000|$|She {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{home and}} was upset at <b>her</b> grandmother <b>for</b> sending <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> this monk. What he really meant was [...] "How can his large teaching fit into your tiny mind" [...] Upon hearing this, the spinster felt ashamed {{that she had}} jumped to a sexual conclusion.|$|R
60|$|She {{flashed a}} sharp glance at him, {{and he felt}} glad {{that it was too}} dark <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his face.|$|E
6000|$|NURSE GUINNESS. Oh, don't {{think of}} such a thing, miss. If Mrs Hushabye has {{forgotten}} all about it, {{it will be a}} pleasant surprise <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you, won't it? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{will be a}} great {{advantage}} to her. You used to say that it would be most desirable <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> more of the world. Away from this place she might marry well.' ...|$|E
50|$|Julia Jordan based her 1999 play Tatjana in Color, {{which was}} {{produced}} off-Broadway at The Culture Project {{during the fall}} of 2003, on a fictionalization {{of the relationship between}} Shiele and the 12-year-old Tatjana von Mossig, the Neulengbach girl whose morals he was ultimately convicted of corrupting <b>for</b> allowing <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his paintings.|$|R
60|$|He was {{prepared}} <b>for</b> <b>her</b> refusal <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him; {{he had imagined}} her wounded and pathetic; he had fancied her insulted and indignant; but she met him eagerly and with a mystifying appeal in her welcome. He began at once, without attempting to bridge the time since they had met with any formalities.|$|R
60|$|The query {{once heard}} {{was not so}} {{embarrassing}} to Jane as she might have imagined. Moreover, it established in her mind a fact that there existed actually other than selfish reasons <b>for</b> <b>her</b> wanting <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him. And {{as she had been}} bold, so she determined to be both honest and brave.|$|R
60|$|EMMY [coaxing] Come now: {{just see}} {{her for a}} minute to please me: theres a good boy. She's given me half-a-crown. She thinks it's life and death to her husband <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you.|$|E
60|$|Colter, {{standing}} at the door, reached a long arm toward the ladder, where he laid his hand on a rung. Taking it away he held it palm outward <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the dark splotch of blood.|$|E
60|$|Columbine {{encountered}} Jim Montana at the corrals, {{and it was}} not {{too dark}} <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his foam-lashed horse. Jim appeared non-committal, almost surly. But Columbine guessed that he had ridden to Kremmling and back in one day, on some order of Jack's.|$|E
5000|$|Finally, her {{abilities}} as regent are debatable. John Julius Norwich speaks of her [...] "total unfitness to govern," [...] but {{the success of}} Stephen during his short tenure is undeniable and she is primarily blamed <b>for</b> <b>her</b> refusal <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the disaffection <b>her</b> relatives caused the local nobility. Jacqueline Alio, her biographer, gives Margaret more credit for competent rule in trying circumstances.|$|R
60|$|Sir Thomas gave <b>her</b> {{more credit}} <b>for</b> {{discretion}} {{on the occasion}} than she deserved; and Fanny could have blessed <b>her</b> <b>for</b> allowing <b>her</b> only <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> displeasure, and not to hear it.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the school}} holidays, Zheng {{and the rest}} of the Homerun cast flew to Malaysia for on-location shoot. Although Zheng was usually able to cry on cue, the cast and crew once had to wait 20 minutes <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> begin. <b>Seeing</b> Zheng crying uncontrollably while {{shooting}} a particularly emotional scene, an impressed Xiang Yun commented [...] "Wah, this little kid is very absorbed in her role".|$|R
60|$|Then {{becoming}} {{aware that she}} had not obscured the windows she came forward to do so, candle in hand. It was too dark <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Jude without, but he could see her face distinctly, and there was an unmistakable tearfulness about the dark, long-lashed eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not Lady Adela. Poor lady, {{she had her}} own {{relations}} with her. She had not by any means recovered the loss of her little boy, and I can quite understand that it must have been too trying <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> me in his place. I understand from Hailes--' ...|$|E
60|$|St. Leonard himself, Ethelbertha thinks charming. We are to {{go again}} on Sunday <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the children. Three or four people we met I fancy {{we shall be}} able to fit in with. We left at half-past six, and took Bute back with us to supper.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've been {{thinking}} of Maggie, and at last I yearned <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> I wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> happy--and it doesn't strike me I find you too shy to tell me I SHALL." ...|$|R
60|$|Our {{search for}} the little Armantine was less prosperous. Cecile could not ride, nor could even walk {{a quarter of a}} mile without nearly dying of fatigue; nay, the jolting of the coach as we drove along the road would have been insupportable <b>to</b> <b>her</b> but <b>for</b> <b>her</b> longing <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> little one. We drove till it was {{impossible}} to get the coach any farther, and still the farm was only just in sight.|$|R
60|$|There was in {{his tone}} a frigid contempt. It was obvious that to him Blanche Stroeve was only a unit {{to be added to}} the {{statistical}} list of attempted suicides in the city of Paris during the current year. He was busy, and could waste no more time on us. He told us that if we came at a certain hour next day, should Blanche be better, it might be possible <b>for</b> <b>her</b> husband <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no, indeed, Annette! She has {{had more}} excuse than almost any one. It makes one grieve <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how the worse nature {{seems to have been}} allowed to grow beyond her power, and how it is like {{something}} rending her, when right and wrong struggle together for the mastery.' ...|$|E
6000|$|With {{the mention}} of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It was {{impossible}} <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner. [...] "But surely," [...] said she, [...] "I may enter his county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lame Katy {{felt as if}} [...] "a truly angel" [...] was {{embracing}} her, {{and could}} only stammer out her thanks, while the other children ran to see the pretty spirit, and touch her soft dress, until she stood in a crowd of blue gowns laughing as they held up their gifts <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> and admire.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, Mr. Bennet," [...] said she, [...] "it is {{very hard}} to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be {{mistress}} of this house, that I should be forced <b>to</b> make way <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> and live <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> take her place in it!" ...|$|R

The opening chapter's of Guy Mankowski's 2017 novel [...] "An Honest Deceit" [...] were cited to be heavily influenced by Schiele's paintings; in particular his portrayals of his sister, Gertrude.|$|R
5000|$|The Jewel of Judgement is {{revealed}} to be the left eye of the Serpent of Chaos, stolen by the Unicorn {{at some point in}} the very distant past.
