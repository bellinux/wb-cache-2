40|$|In {{the latest}} twenty {{years we have}} {{witnessed}} an exponential proliferation <b>of</b> <b>international</b> <b>commissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> mandated to investigate serious violations of international law. However, the inquiry tool has been originally institutionalised {{at the beginning of}} the 20 th century as mean of preventive diplomacy aimed at stating the facts for dispute settlement purposes. Since then inquiries have significantly evolved into mechanisms that denounce and shed light on serious violations of international law in order to provoke a response by the international community. What are the underlying causes of this new role and of the recent surge <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> <b>commissions?</b> Should <b>commissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> be viewed as merely fact-finders or as law-applicable/adjudication bodies? Should their tasks be confined to finding the facts or may they perform more dynamic and political roles such as raising alert and provoking reactions?

These and other questions are the core of this academic contribution which, through a comprehensive analysis of the work and practice <b>of</b> <b>commissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry,</b> aims to shed more light on a topic that has increasingly become the focus of intense debate among academics, practitioners and international decision-makers...|$|R

The commission president Professor Jacob Sundberg subsequently concluded that Tottle was not alone in his enterprise to deny the famine on the basis that material included in his book could not have been available to a private person without official Soviet assistance.|$|E

40|$|This article argues {{first that}} the {{international}} community has elaborated a collective memory of rapes occurred during armed conflicts in the 20 th. Century through the jurisprudence of international criminal tribunals and the activity of UN bodies; secondly, that memory of rapes is “‘gendered”’, since it is through the eyes of women that rapes are mainly seen and remembered”. To support our thesis, the article will borrow the notion of “collective memory” introduced by the French sociologist Maurice Halbwachs and will analyse it from an international law perspective. The article will start with a short legal history of wartime rape, before analysing the main judgments rendered by the following international criminal tribunals: Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals, International Criminal Court for the Former Yugoslavia, International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, Special Court for Sierra Leone, International Criminal Court. regarding episodes of rape occurred during armed conflicts. A paragraph is dedicated to the activity of the UN Special Representatives on sexual violence in conflict and of the UN <b>International</b> Independent <b>Commission</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry</b> for Syria. We will then use the notion of collective memory to comment on the role of international bodies in the preservation of the memory of rapes occurred during armed conflicts...|$|R
40|$|Two major {{developments}} have shaped the international community’s involvement {{in efforts to}} bring justice to situations of armed conflict: the turn to anti-impunity and the global protection reflex. The former focuses in international criminal law and accountability, while the latter has informed both humanitarian intervention {{and the protection of}} fundamental human rights, as advocated by the humanitarian community. The proliferation <b>of</b> <b>international</b> <b>commissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> (CoIs) can also be placed in this context. The mechanism has been increasingly deployed {{in the aftermath of the}} so-called Arab Spring. Also in the case of Syria, the Human Rights Council (HRC) has set up a permanent Independent <b>International</b> Inquiry <b>Commission,</b> in order to monitor the observation of International Human Rights Law (IHRL) by the parties to the conflict. The Syrian CoI’s mandate can be scrutinised from two perspectives: the formal HRC-given mandate, and its self-proclaimed mandate, which it exerts in its reports and public appearances. While the former focuses on ending all alleged violations to protect the population, the latter should, according to the CoI, be interpreted in a manner, which is the most conducive to civilian protection. In my research, I aim to find out, whether the Syrian CoI has respected its formal and its self-proclaimed mandate. Fundamental to both are the development of IHRL in a manner that is more favourable to civilian protection. While CoIs have been considered a fundamental mechanism in the promotion of global justice, they been both praised and criticised for their progressive interpretations of IHRL, among other things. Also at the beginning of its mandate, the Syrian CoI was said to have assigned IHRL protection responsibilities to non-state armed groups (NSAGs), in a manner that is expansive compared to the state-centric, status quo reading of international law. However, despite its mandate, it seems that the CoI quickly abandoned its willingness to engage in rights-based legal analysis, and even less so in the development of IHRL. I make my assessment of the CoI’s human rights analysis based on three fundamental issues, which mark the current discussions on the application of IHRL in armed conflict. In order to see if the CoI is following its rights-based mandate, I evaluate the CoI reports based on three questions: how it applies IHRL next to or independent of International Humanitarian Law (IHL), whether it considers rights catalogues holistically – particularly economic, social and cultural (ESC) rights, and whether it is willing to assign IHRL responsibilities to NSAGs. Based on my analysis of the CoI’s repots through these three questions, I argue that after a progressive beginning, the Syrian CoI no longer follows its formal or self-proclaimed mandate, nor UN guidance on IHRL fact-finding. Facts also have an advocacy function, and rather than engaging in promoting a protection reflex in the international human rights system, the CoI focuses on matters of anti-impunity, claiming that it cannot do anything, until the UN Security Council refers the Syrian case to the International Criminal Court (ICC). Moreover, the CoI has given political statements that fall well beyond the parameters of its mandate. This has a negative bearing on the CoI’s credibility. I argue that the CoI should act as an ally of the humanitarian community by promoting IHRL protection concerns to the parties and more globally, and I propose a number of concrete recommendations in order for the CoI to better balance the two complementary goals of anti-impunity and civilian protection. These recommendations are highly relevant as UN planning for transitional justice is already fully operational, and international actors are once again demonstrating a willingness to insert ‘managerialism’ in a transitional setting. By employing a more holistic conception of rights protection and by truly acting as a voice of the civilians whilst remaining self-critical, the CoI is more likely to lift itself out of irrelevance in the global division of labour. My analysis is based on both critical literature, and the acknowledgement that my own pro-rights view bears its risks...|$|R

Through an analysis of previous 20 th Century <b>Commissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry</b> and then the TRC as a <b>Commission</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry,</b> the report found that the TRC was able to break new ground in both its structural orientation and the openness with which its processes were carried out.

Finally, through a discussion around debates on the justice model employed by the TRC {{in the context of the}} political climate during that period, the report found that the TRC was unable to fulfil its fullest accountability ambitions because it was inherently forced to pursue an agenda which put it on the path of pursuing legitimacy. The ends of accountability and legitimacy were often at odds with each other in the TRC and the report goes on to highlight how this conflict may be playing itself out in two other <b>Commission</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry.</b> Ultimately the report shows the way that the TRC forged a new path for <b>Commissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry</b> but the inherent flaws within the TRC may have been passed on to its successors.
