Distributed prediction of these solute <b>flow</b> <b>paths</b> in typically heterogeneous catchments must inevitably be highly uncertain without some {{identification of a}} spatial structure relating small-scale measurements of soil properties to flow predictions distributed over large catchments. To date, the evidence for profile and catenal structure within soil hydrological properties and resultant solute <b>flow</b> <b>paths</b> is not fully embraced by the hydrologica community.

Second, to outline {{how much of this}} structure has been incorporated into previous hydrological simulations using distributed models, and third, to examine the physical basis of attempts to simply parameter and <b>flow</b> <b>paths</b> dimensions using pedological classifications. The available evidence suggests that a considerable number of world soils show profile-ward structure within their hydrological properties and resultant <b>flow</b> <b>paths.</b> Changes in profile-ward patterns along catenal sequences remain uncertain.

It boosts {{the pressure of the}} liquid hydrogen from 1.9 to 45 MPa (276 to 6,515 psia), and operates at approximately 35,360rpm with a power of 71,140hp. The discharge flow from the turbopump is routed to, and through, the main valve and is then split into three flow paths. One path is through the jacket of the main combustion chamber, where the hydrogen is used to cool the chamber walls.

Furthermore, transient pressure data shows the largest pressure drop between the injection and production wellheads occurs near the production wellbore, so lowering the outlet impedance by increasing the apertures of outlet <b>flow</b> <b>paths</b> will have the greatest effect on reducing the overall reservoir impedance.

40|$|Riparian buffers in {{agricultural}} landscapes {{are designed to}} trap pollutants in overland flow by slowing, filtering, and infiltrating surface runoff entering the buffer via sheet flow. However, observational evidence suggests that concentrated flow is prevalent from agricultural fields. Also, over time sediment can accumulate in riparian buffers forming berms that restrict sheet flow from moving into the buffers; these berms ultimately back up surface runoff, resulting in an eventual breakthrough which concentrates runoff. Breakthrough by concentrated flow can lead to gully formation that may reduce the filtering capacities of buffer systems by providing direct conduits to stream channels. This study explores the frequency of concentrated <b>flow</b> <b>paths</b> in riparian buffers at both the field and watershed scale. At the field scale, intensive topographic surveys were conducted at 10 field sites in southern Illinois to characterize concentrated <b>flow</b> <b>paths,</b> accumulated berm sediments, and field area drained by concentrated flow. Detailed digital elevation models (DEMs) were created for each site and riparian buffer and agriculture field characteristics were analyzed to assess the development and occurrence of concentrated <b>flow</b> <b>paths.</b> At each site, soil samples were analyzed to characterize sediment deposition patterns within the buffer. To assess the prevalence of concentrated <b>flow</b> <b>paths</b> at the watershed scale, three watersheds in southern Illinois were selected for walking stream surveys. Five stream segments, approximately 1000 m long, were randomly selected within each watershed and surveyed for the occurrence and size of concentrated <b>flow</b> <b>paths.</b> These data were analyzed with respect to riparian buffer vegetation, buffer width, and surrounding land cover data. Concentrated <b>flow</b> <b>paths</b> were identified in all topographic surveys and all walking stream surveys indicating a common occurrence {{in agricultural}} watersheds of southern Illinois. Among field scale sites, concentrated flow accounted for 82. 5 - 100 % of the drainage areas contributing to riparian buffers.

Current riparian buffer design principles {{are based on the}} assumption that sheet flow is the primary form of surface runoff entering buffers.

40|$|Rapid flow {{processes}} in connected preferential <b>flow</b> <b>paths</b> are widely accepted {{to play a}} key role for rainfall-runoff response at the hillslope scale, but a quantitative description of these processes is still a major challenge in hydrological research. This paper investigates the approach of incorporating preferential <b>flow</b> <b>paths</b> explicitly in a process-based model for modelling water flows and solute transport at a steep forested hillslope. We conceptualise preferential <b>flow</b> <b>paths</b> as spatially explicit structures with high conductivity and low retention capacity, and evaluate simulations with different combinations of vertical and lateral <b>flow</b> <b>paths</b> against measured discharge and tracer breakthrough. Out of 122 tested realisations, five setups fulfilled our selection criteria for the water flow simulation. These setups successfully simulated infiltration, vertical and lateral subsurface flow in structures, and allowed predicting the magnitude, dynamics and water balance of the hydrological response of the hillslope during subsequent periods of steady-state sprinkling on selected plots and intermittent rainfall on the entire hillslope area. The solute transport simulations with these setups matched spread and shape of the observed breakthrough curve well, indicating that macrodispersion induced by preferential flow was captured well by the topology of the preferential flow network. The model, however, could not match the very fast breakthrough times observed in the tracer experiment. This can readily be attributed to the simplified representation of the spatial dimensions of the implemented distinctive structures in the 2 -D cross-section, which led to an underestimation of effective transport velocities in comparison to the correctly modelled flux densities. The configurations of successful model setups suggest that preferential flow bound to connected vertical and lateral <b>flow</b> <b>paths</b> is a first-order control on the hydrology of the study hillslope, whereas spatial variability of soil depth is secondary. Virtual experiments for investigating hillslope controls on subsurface processes should thus explicitly consider distinctive <b>flow</b> <b>paths</b> as a potential determinant...|$|R

Chapter 2 investigates the controls on stream temperature in salmon-bearing headwater streams in two common hydrogeologic settings: 1) drainage-ways, which are low-gradient streams that flow through broad valleys; and 2) discharge-slopes, which are high gradient streams that flow through narrow valleys. The results from chapter 2 showed significant differences in stream temperatures between the two hydrogeologic settings. Observed stream temperatures were higher in drainage-way sites than in discharge-slope sites, and showed strong correlations as a continuous function with the calculated topographic metric flow-weighted slope. Additionally, modeling {{results indicated that the}} potential for groundwater discharge to moderate stream temperature is not equal between the two hydrogeologic settings, with groundwater having a greater moderating effect on stream temperature at the low gradient drainage-way sites. Chapter 3 examines the influence of groundwater on juvenile coho salmon winter habitat along the Anchor River. Two backwater habitats were selected from the larger set of 25 coho overwintering sites from a previous study for an in-depth hydrologic analysis. The results from chapter 3 showed that the type of groundwater discharge (i. e., focused versus diffuse groundwater discharge) can {{play an important role in}} determining habitat suitability in these backwater sites.

The Ginkgo basalt was examined over its [...] <b>flow</b> <b>path</b> from a Ginkgo flow feeder dike near Kahlotus, Washington to the flow terminus in the Pacific Ocean at Yaquina Head, Oregon. The basalt had an upper melting temperature of 1095 ± 5°C and a lower temperature to 1085 ± 5°C; this indicates that the maximum temperature drop along the Ginkgo flow was 20°C. The lava must have spread quickly to achieve this uniformity. Analyses indicate that the flow must remain laminar, as turbulent flow would cool more quickly. This could be accomplished by sheet flow, which can travel at velocities of [...] without turbulence and minimal cooling, suggesting that the Ginkgo flow occurred in less than a week.
