It concludes that early attempts towards European construction of the Mediterranean were mainly triggered by the EC’s economic interests and necessitated by its recurring <b>enlargement</b> <b>processes.</b> The EC did not perceive the Mediterranean as a coherent region, and a clear distinction was made between its various geographical components. The analysis also shows {{that most of the}} Community’s initiatives for political cooperation with many Mediterranean countries did not succeed.

40|$|This Regional Input is a {{supplement}} to Ezoneplus Working Paper No. 13 on the Social Dimension of the Eastward Enlargement of the Eurozone. Political transition from authoritarian to democratic society has been extensive in all three Baltic States. The Baltic States are often examined together in political studies despite {{of the fact that}} there is much more variation among these countries in the political sphere than in the economic and social spheres. The problems stemming from the political sphere might be even more crucial for EU enlargement because of their relative instability and slow working comparing that to the economic and social concerns. Therefore this study emphasises some major political differences between the Baltic States that should be taken into account when analysing EU eastward <b>enlargement</b> <b>processes.</b> The paper aims to analyze social and political dimensions of eurozone enlargement in the Baltic States emphasizing also negative consequences of transition and integration processes and their possible impact on EU accession.

40|$|Theories {{and good}} practices, {{evolving}} simultaneously with {{the processes of}} deepening the European integration or Europeanization of public administration, {{have been developed for}} the concept of the European Administrative Space (EAS). Although, for the time being, EAS expresses pre-eminently as a dynamic system, revealing the development of own self-adjustment mechanisms, we witness a few preoccupations concerning the systemic substantiation. The self-adjustment mechanisms of EAS are based on legislative harmonization, transfer of good practices, as well as strategies of the administrative reform. The national, infra-national and European administrations represent the organising pillar of EAS. This reality leads to the hypothesis of organising EAS as a multipolar system, with mixed architecture. The relative recent occurrence of EAS justifies its development on principles similar to those of New Public Management. The <b>enlargement</b> <b>processes</b> of EAS, the administrative convergence and dynamics are emergent and express systemic effects, encompassing the robustness of the administrative institutions, national or regional traditions, organisational culture or geo-political aspectsSystemic Analysis,European Administrative Space,Administrative System...|$|R

40|$|The Eastern {{enlargement}} of the European Union and {{the requirements of the}} European Monetary Union call for increased flexibility of labour markets in both the current EU members and candidate countries. If labour markets and institutions are rigid in the monetary union, market disequilibrium is likely to grow. The present paper aims to give a macroeconomic overview of the Baltic States’ labour market in the period 1995 ? 2001, laying emphasis on the issues of labour market flexibility and labour migration in the context of EU eastward enlargement. The Baltic States comprise a particular regional cluster and an interesting case for making generalizations about the processes of transition and EU eastward enlargement, and developing a new field of economics - the economics of transition and integration. In real terms, one has to admit, the influence of the Baltic economies on the EU eastward <b>enlargement</b> <b>processes</b> can hardly be significant, as the very small size of the Baltic markets bears no comparison with either the markets of the current EU member states (EU 15) or the other candidate countries (CC). The Baltic States have dutifully observed the main international standards regulating labour relations in accordance with the EU rules. Comparing the Baltic States’ labour market with those of EU 15 and the other candidate countries, one comes {{to the conclusion that the}} Baltic States’ labour markets are flexible. The most flexible among them is the Estonian labour market followed by that of Latvia. However, predictably, after joining the EU, the labour markets of the new members may become more rigid due to the increasing influence on them of institutions and trade unions, and due to more generous funding of labour market policies. Moreover, a decline of wage flexibility can be predicted. Free movement of labour as a natural consequence of EU enlargement will also exert pressure on the Baltic labour markets due to the possible migration of better-qualified and flexible labour force, and cross-border movement of labour within the Baltic Sea Region countries. Coupled with ageing of the population, it may increase shortage of skilled labour. Consequently, if labour mobility increases and labour market flexibility declines remarkably during the <b>enlargement</b> <b>processes,</b> market disequilibrium is likely to grow in the Baltic States as well. ...|$|R

50|$|After {{the end of}} the Cold War in {{the late}} 1980s, the strict border regimes were {{abandoned}} and the border zones gradually opened, starting with the German reunification in 1990 and continuing with the step-by-step integration of new member states into the Schengen Treaty as part of the <b>enlargement</b> <b>process</b> of the European Union. At the same time, large military facilities such as training grounds and military research establishments in or close to the border zones were closed down.
