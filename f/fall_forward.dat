5|$|Despite their injuries, the SEALs made a {{defensive}} retreat through the steep woods. Dietz begins to lose consciousness and shouts questions to Luttrell, unwittingly revealing the team's position to the Taliban. Murphy and Axelson jump off another ridge to flee from the Taliban fighters. Luttrell tries to carry Dietz down the mountain, but Dietz is {{shot in the}} shoulder; the impact forces Luttrell to lose his grip and <b>fall</b> <b>forward</b> off the cliff. A dying Dietz remains {{at the top of}} the cliff and is killed by the Taliban insurgents. Murphy decides to try climbing back up the cliff to get a phone signal in order to call in support forces via satellite phone. Axelson and Luttrell shoot at the Taliban fighters to provide Murphy with cover. When he finally reaches higher ground, Murphy is able to alert the SEAL base of his team's location and request emergency assistance right before he is shot dead by Taliban fighters.|$|E

2500|$|The Aerodium is a skydiving {{simulator}} {{wind tunnel}} invented in Germany in 1984. [...] In 1987, Action Park built and opened their own Aerodium in the Waterworld {{section of the}} park, becoming the first American amusement park to open an Aerodium. [...] The attraction was operated by Aerodium Inc, who would act as a concessionaire for the park through 1997. Stadium seating encircled {{the perimeter of the}} Aerodium, allowing friends and spectators to watch riders fly. Riders wearing a special skydiving suit, helmet, and earplugs would join the bodyflight instructor one by one on a trampoline-like netting directly over the fan. The instructor would grab each rider's wrists and guide the rider to <b>fall</b> <b>forward,</b> allowing the fan to lift the rider skyward. After a few seconds of flight, the attendant operating the fan would cut the power, causing the rider to fall onto the air cushions surrounding the fan. Park guests' flights were limited to a maximum of 6 or 7 feet (2 m) above the ground, approximately a foot or two over the instructor's head. The Aerodium also caused severe injuries, for example, when a rider instinctively tried to break his fall by extending his arm, which caused shoulder dislocation, severed nerves, and near-permanent paralysis of the arm.|$|E
2500|$|Late in the {{day they}} heard , the Big Giant, approaching. [...] His {{footsteps}} shook the canyon walls. Then they saw him come to the water's edge and stoop down to drink. He drank deeply four times, until most of the water was gone from the lake. Then he saw {{the reflection of the}} twins in the water, and stood and stared at them. [...] he shouted. The twins did not understand, but answered, [...] Then [...] paced back and forth and said, [...] "What are the two beautiful things that I see, and how shall I kill them?" [...] The twins shouted back, [...] "What beautiful Big Thing is walking about? [...] And how shall we kill it?" [...] , the Wind came to them and whispered in their ear that since Big Giant was their elder he should be given right of first strike, as they were destroying the child of the Sun. Then suddenly , the Wind, called [...] "Akóóh! Beware! Jump!" [...] and suddenly the twins found themselves standing {{on the end of a}} rainbow, just as , the Big Giant, hurled his great black knife at them. The rainbow raised up, and the knife passed just below their feet. [...] , the Wind, whispered [...] "Keep low now!" [...] and [...] hurled his great blue knife. [...] It passed over them. [...] The Wind said, [...] "Jump to the right!" [...] and the great yellow knife of [...] passed just to their left. [...] "This is his last weapon," [...] whispered the Wind. [...] "Jump to the left. Now!" [...] The twins leapt to the left, just as the white knife with many points passed to the right of them." [...] The twins were about to use one of their own weapons when a blinding flash of lightning came out of the sky and struck [...] the Giant on the side of the head. [...] The heavens shook with the thunder, and the Giant shook but stayed on his feet. [...] Then the elder of the two brothers shot a chain-lightning arrow at [...] [...] The Giant dropped to his knee, but stood again. [...] The second brother then shot an arrow of sheet lightning which struck the giant in the chest. [...] He fell to both knees and began to <b>fall</b> <b>forward,</b> catching himself with his hands. [...] Then the first brother shot a deadly sunbeam arrow and hit the Giant in the head. [...] fell face down on the ground. [...] Blood flowed in great streams from the Giant's mouth, and , the Wind said, [...] "Stop the blood before it reaches the water! It will become alive!" [...] The twins ran to block the flow of blood and it remains on the ground today near the spring at the foot of , the Blue Bead Mountain.|$|E

60|$|The danger is, observe, {{that the}} midmost stone at f pushes {{out the side}} ones: then if we can give the side ones such a shape as that, left to themselves, they would fall heavily forward, they will resist this push out by their weight, exactly in {{proportion}} to their own particular inclination or desire to tumble in.
