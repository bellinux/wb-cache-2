50|$|The {{proteins}} {{that make up}} the remaining 20% of the fraction of proteins in cream are known as whey proteins. Whey proteins are also widely referred to as serum proteins, which is used when the casein proteins have been precipitated out of solution. The two main components of whey proteins in milk are β-lactoglobulin and α-lactalbumin. The remaining whey proteins in milk are; immunoglobulins, bovine serum albumin, and enzymes such as lysozyme. Whey proteins are much more water-soluble than casein proteins. The main biological function of β-lactoglobulin in milk is to serve as a way to transfer vitamin A, and the main biological function of α-lactalbumin in lactose synthesis. The whey proteins are very resistant against acids and proteolytic enzymes. However whey proteins are heat sensitive proteins, the heating of milk will cause the denaturation of the whey proteins. The denaturation of these proteins happens in two steps. The structures of β-lactoglobulin and α-lactalbumin unfold, and then the second step is the aggregation of the proteins within milk. This {{is one of the main}} factors that allows whey proteins to have such good emulsifying properties. Native whey proteins are also known for their good whupping properties, and in milk products as described above their <b>gelling</b> <b>properties.</b> Upon denaturation of whey proteins, there is an increase in the water holding capacity of the product.|$|E

[...] The high {{water holding capacity}} helps to provide texture, mouthfeel and moistness, extends the yield of certain foods, and may extend shelf-life of some products.

40|$|Background and aims: Texture is an important, yet complex, quality {{attribute}} of food. Food structure and properties {{can be linked}} to texture perception during the first bite. However, the perception of attributes during chew down is more difficult to explain, as food requires to be broken down to be swallowed safely. Food oral processing, which  is a recent discipline connecting food science to the physiology of the eating process, is considered to be the key for understanding dynamic food texture perception. The aim of this thesis is to understand the link between food properties and texture perception by investigating oral food breakdown, in simple model foods. Methods: Gels were used as a model for soft solid foods. Several <b>properties</b> of the <b>gels</b> were controlled by modifying the composition of gels, including fracture stress and fracture strain, oil droplets binding to the gels matrix, melting, serum release and mechanical contrast. The texture perception of the gels was measured using several sensory methods. Qualitative descriptive analysis (QDA), progressive profiling and temporal dominance of sensations (TDS) were compared in the assessment of dynamic texture perception. In order to link <b>gel</b> <b>properties</b> to texture perception, the oral processing of gels was measured through analyses on the gel bolus and measurements of chewing behaviour. Gel boli were expectorated at various stages of oral processing and were analysed for gel fragments size and number, mechanical properties and saliva incorporation. These analyses were used to quantify the degree of breakdown of gels and to relate bolus properties to changes in texture perception. Chewing behaviour was measured using Electromyography (EMG) to understand the role of oral processing behaviour in bolus formation and dynamic texture perception. Results: Dynamic texture perception of gels could be measured by QDA, progressive profiling and TDS which were complementary methods. Fracture <b>properties</b> of <b>gels</b> could predict the perception of first bite texture attributes. Fracture stress and fracture strain were correlated to first bite firmness and brittleness respectively. During chew down, the link between <b>gel</b> <b>properties</b> and texture perception became less clear. Nonetheless, fracture <b>properties</b> and other <b>gels</b> <b>properties,</b> such as melting and serum release, related to chew down perception. Bolus <b>properties</b> depended on <b>gel</b> <b>properties,</b> but related better to chew down texture perception than <b>gel</b> <b>properties.</b> Mainly changes in mechanical properties and fragmentation of the bolus could explained the perception of complex texture attributes, such as creaminess and graininess respectively. Chewing behaviour depended on products properties. In addition, chewing behaviour impacted the formation of the bolus and could result in differences in dynamic texture perception between groups of individuals. Conclusions: The oral breakdown of food is a valuable input to understand the perception of complex chew down texture attributes. Such an input could be used to design foods with a desired texture sensory profile for reformulation of foods fitting in a healthier diet or foods for target consumer groups...|$|R

The gelation and <b>gel</b> <b>properties</b> were investigated by rheometry, scanning electron microscopy, di erential scanning calorimetry, UV-Vis and uorescence spectroscopy. The pyrene based LMOGs form complexes with 2, 4, 7 -trinitro uorenone (TNF) and self-assemble non-covalently through - stacking, donor-acceptor and van der Waals interactions to form thermoreversible gels, which remain stable at least for two years. The strongest gels were obtained in primary alcohols whereas the poor solubility of TNF restricted gelation in nonpolar hydrocarbons. It was observed that the gelation behavior of the two-component gelator system can be estimated in both nonpolar and polar solvents by using the Hansen solubility parameters and distance. The unknown solubility parameters of the gelators were estimated by a group contribution method. The gelation ability of the two-component system was found to correlate with the hydrogen bonding solubility parameter of the solvent. Electron microscopy showed that the gelation occurs due to self-assembly of the gelators into long gel bers that form an entangled gel network. The solvent and the structure of the pyrene based LMOG have a large e ect on the gel structure and; consequently, the <b>properties.</b> The <b>gels</b> with less ber bundles and denser gel network were more elastic and had higher stability and viscosity.
