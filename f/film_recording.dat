25|$|Electric {{traction}} {{was introduced}} in 1905 with electric multiple units operating between Uxbridge, Harrow-on-the-Hill and Baker Street. To remove steam and smoke from the tunnels in central London, the railway purchased electric locomotives, exchanged for steam locomotives at Harrow from 1908. In 1910, a seventeen-minute silent <b>film</b> <b>recording</b> was made showing large portions of the journey from Baker Street to Aylesbury and Uxbridge, seen from the cab of a train. The film survives and is publicly available.|$|E
500|$|Dylan {{made his}} first trip to the United Kingdom from December 1962 to January 1963. He had been invited by TV {{director}} Philip Saville to appear in a drama, Madhouse on Castle Street, which Saville was directing for BBC Television. At the end of the play, Dylan performed [...] "Blowin' in the Wind", one of its first public performances. The <b>film</b> <b>recording</b> of Madhouse on Castle Street was destroyed by the BBC in 1968. While in London, Dylan performed at London folk clubs, including the Troubadour, Les Cousins, and Bunjies. He also learned material from UK performers, including Martin Carthy.|$|E
500|$|As David Bordwell describes, {{technological}} improvements {{continued at}} a swift pace: [...] "Between 1932 and 1935, [...] created directional microphones, increased the frequency range of <b>film</b> <b>recording,</b> reduced ground noise... and extended the volume range." [...] These technical advances often meant new aesthetic opportunities: [...] "Increasing the fidelity of recording... heightened the dramatic possibilities of vocal timbre, pitch, and loudness." [...] Another basic problem—famously spoofed in the 1952 film Singin' in the Rain—was that some silent-era actors {{simply did not}} have attractive voices; though this issue was frequently overstated, there were related concerns about general vocal quality and the casting of performers for their dramatic skills in roles also requiring singing talent beyond their own. By 1935, rerecording of vocals by the original or different actors in postproduction, {{a process known as}} [...] "looping", had become practical. The ultraviolet recording system introduced by RCA in 1936 improved the reproduction of sibilants and high notes.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the release}} of the 1976 album, a film {{adaptation}} of the musical became mired in development hell for more than fifteen years, as the rights were passed on to several major studios, and various directors and actors considered. In 1993, producer Robert Stigwood sold the rights to Andrew G. Vajna, who agreed to finance the film through his production company Cinergi Pictures, with the Walt Disney Studios distributing the film through Hollywood Pictures. After Stone stepped down from the project in 1994, Parker agreed to write and direct the <b>film.</b> <b>Recording</b> sessions for the songs and soundtrack took place at CTS Studios in London, England, roughly four months before filming. Parker worked with Rice and Lloyd Webber to compose the soundtrack, reworking the original songs by creating the music first and then the lyrics. They also wrote a new song, [...] "You Must Love Me", for the film. Principal photography commenced in February 1996 with a budget of $55 million, and concluded in May of that year. Filming took place on locations in Buenos Aires and Budapest, and on soundstages at Shepperton Studios. The film's production in Argentina was met with controversy, as the cast and crew faced protests over fears that the project would tarnish Eva's image.|$|E
2500|$|The Academy Award-winning song [...] "We May Never Love Like This Again" [...] was {{composed}} by Al Kasha and Joel Hirschhorn and performed by Maureen McGovern, who {{appears in a}} cameo as a lounge singer and on the score's soundtrack album, which features the <b>film</b> <b>recording</b> plus the commercially released single version. [...] Additionally, the theme tune is interpolated into the film's underscore by Williams. The song's writers collaborated on [...] "The Morning After" [...] from The Poseidon Adventure, an Academy Award-winning song which was also recorded by McGovern, although hers was not the vocal used in that film.|$|E
2500|$|Shore {{began his}} work on the music early during the {{production}} of [...] in late 2000 and recorded the first pieces of music (the Moria sequence) in spring of 2001 to a 40-minute teaser of the film, as the film was still being shot. The scored section also included a version of the Breaking of the Fellowship sequence, with an extended tin whistle solo, and a montage of footage from the following two films. The rest of the score was recorded in London during the editing of the film in post production. Shore would later return to the finished <b>film,</b> <b>recording</b> additional music and revised takes for the extended DVD version in March 2002.|$|E

In 1993, the episodes with {{restored}} colour (see [...] "Broadcast and reception", above) were released on VHS. A DVD of the serial was released on 19 March 2012, featuring improved sound and picture restoration. The DVD included an audio commentary, on-screen text notes, a retrospective documentary [...] "The Devil Rides Out" [...] in which cast & crew looked back on the making of the serial, and an obituary documentary [...] "Remembering Barry Letts" [...] in which family and colleagues looked back over the life and work of the noted writer/producer/director. The documentary included extensive contributions from Letts himself, from a long interview he conducted with producer Ed Stradling in 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Alex Heffes, who {{provided}} the music for Macdonald's One Day in September, Touching the Void, and The Last King of Scotland, scored the film. It was recorded in the United Kingdom. Heffes indicated {{that he had a}} preference for scoring around the dialogue rather than through it. As with the recording of his previous works, Heffes will be conducting the orchestra himself to enable re-scoring as the recording session proceeds. Macdonald prefers to involve Heffes early on in production, and in an unusual move for a studio film, he had Heffes write some of the music to State of Play in advance of principal photography, based purely upon the script. Heffes said this was to provide a hint to the direction the film was going to take. He said that he and Macdonald had decided to take the score down an unusual path, [...] "off the beaten track", and that the prospect was a [...] "liberating" [...] one. Grammy Award-winning record producer [...] "Flood" [...] (aka Mark Ellis) is working with Heffes on the score. Heffes said that working with Ellis [...] "opened his mind" [...] and that they attempted to push boundaries. He said that in producing the score, Flood brought an aesthetic to recording the instruments that was atypical for <b>film</b> <b>recording</b> sessions.|$|E
2500|$|By August 2014, Gunn had [...] "some ideas listed, {{but nothing}} for sure" [...] {{in terms of}} songs to include in Quill's Awesome Mix Vol. 2 mixtape, for which he felt [...] "a little {{pressure}} for the soundtrack {{because so many people}} loved [...] and we went platinum and all that other stuff. But I feel like the soundtrack in the second one is better." [...] By June 2015, Gunn had chosen all of the songs and built them into the script, calling Awesome Mix Vol. 2 [...] "more diverse" [...] than the first one, with [...] "some really incredibly famous songs and then some songs that people have never heard." [...] Tyler Bates had returned to score the film by August 2015. As with Guardians of the Galaxy, Bates wrote some of the score first so Gunn could film to the music, as opposed to Bates scoring to the <b>film.</b> <b>Recording</b> for the score began in January 2017 at Abbey Road Studios. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2: Awesome Mix Volume 2, along with the film score album composed by Bates, were released on April 21, 2017. A cassette version of Awesome Mix Volume 2 was released on June 23, 2017, while a deluxe edition vinyl LP featuring both Awesome Mix Volume 2 and Bates' score was released on August 11, 2017.|$|E
