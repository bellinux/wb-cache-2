25|$|As {{with most}} European standards, {{compliance}} by the member {{countries of the}} European Union is purely voluntary, and to be determined {{at the level of}} the member country, usually by means of legislation, or by its own standards organization. To illustrate, this standard, which has been accepted by the United Kingdom, is known locally as BS EN 1789:2007, with the 'BS' referring to British Standards. As a result, the adoption of this standard has varied considerably from one country to another. Most countries, for example, have adopted the sections dealing with vehicle design and performance, while only a few (the UK, Ireland, and Sweden at this writing), have fully adopted the colour, warning system, and livery schemes for such vehicles. To further complicate matters, some countries have adopted some portion of the visual identity standards, but not all. In the Netherlands, Belgium, and some parts of Germany, the conversion to the basic identifying colour (yellow) is occurring, but the balance of visual identity provisions are not. In addition, some countries which are not currently members of the European Union, such as Norway are adopting some portions of the standards, primarily because few other good standards exist for this purpose, particularly those that reflect European realities. The rate and <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> with the standard is a conscious choice by individual countries, while in others, compliance is a matter of the priorities for the changing of older, country specific, legislation. As previously stated, compliance with the standard is purely voluntary. There are no untoward financial implications to compliance, since only ambulances purchased after ratification of the standard by each country are required to be compliant. There is no mandatory provision for the retrofitting of existing ambulances.|$|E

Briefly and generally, in the first person, a mere intention is indicated by shall, as, I shall go; whereas will denotes some <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> or determination, as, I will go--as if my going had been requested or forbidden. In the second and the third person, will merely forecasts, as, You (or he) will go; but shall implies something of promise, permission or compulsion by the speaker, as, You (or he) shall go. Another and less obvious compulsion--that of circumstance--speaks in shall, as sometimes used with good effect: In Germany you shall not turn over a chip without uncovering a philosopher.

We introduce the notion of optimization norms which constrain agent behaviour {{in a manner that}} is significantly distinct from norms in the traditional sense. We argue that optimization norms underpin most other norms, and offer a richer representation of these. We outline a methodology for identifying the optimization norms that underpin other norms. We then define a notion <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> for optimization norms, as well as a notion of consistency and inconsistency resolution. We offer an algebraic formalization of valued optimization norms which allows us to explicitly reason about <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> and graded sanctions.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the use and management of hazardous chemical substances (HCS) at a chemistry department in a selected Higher Education Institution in Gauteng province. Method: A quantitative, baseline descriptive study was conducted using a structured survey checklist. The population consisted of the chemistry department. Other than purposive observation by the researcher, employees present during data collection were approached for further clarifying comment to survey questions. Results: It emerged that physical-, health- and environmental hazard classes of HCS were present; and that hazard types included flammable liquids, HCS with acute toxicity and carcinogenicity. Selected exposure control measures were lacking which created risks of fire and explosion. Conclusion: The study reflected the use and management of HCS, the actual and potential human exposure and the exposure control measures.
