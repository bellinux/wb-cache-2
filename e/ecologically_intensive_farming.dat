For a given production target, Green et al. (2005) conclude in favor of land sparing if the relation between biodiversity and yield is decreasing and convex. Indeed, with a shift to extensive farming, biodiversity then increases little on already cultivated land, while it decreases strongly on newly cultivated land. According to these authors and to Phalan et al. (2011 a), available empirical data are in favor of a land sparing strategy. We extend the model of Green et al. (2005) by adding the reaction of supply and demand to prices. We show that extensive farming is more interesting than intensive farming for biodiversity if the relation between biodiversity and yield does not have a very high degree of convexity, if demand reacts to prices and if the profitability of extensive farming is lower. Therefore, we do not obtain the result of Green et al. (2005) when production results from market equilibrium. Besides, extensive farming is detrimental to consumers when their surplus is evaluated in a restrictive way as increasing in quantities consumed and decreasing in prices. Its effect on agricultural producers is indeterminate. Distinguishing food demand in vegetal and animal products, we show that extensive farming reduces mostly the size of the animal product market, which demand is more price elastic. Integrating demand for animal products increases the advantage of extensive farming towards biodiversity by increasing the price elasticity of demand. The opposite result is obtained when we consider the introduction of policies for the mandatory incorporation of biofuels in fuel. Indeed, the demand for biofuels varies little with prices, to the detriment of extensive farming as far as biodiversity conservation is concerned. We discuss the implications of this model on the social pressure on protected areas, on the relations between different outlets and on welfare and food security. We also discuss its contribution to the analyses notably of Perfecto and Vandermeer (2010) and Tscharntke et al. (2012) on this topic. Finally, we discuss how to take into account innovations like <b>ecologically</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>farming...</b>|$|E

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of scientists have recently raised concerns about {{the threat posed by}} human intervention on the evolution of parasites and disease agents. New parasites (including pathogens) keep emerging and parasites which previously were considered to be ‘under control’ are re-emerging, sometimes in highly virulent forms. This re-emergence may be parasite evolution, driven by human activity, including ecological changes related to modern agricultural practices. <b>Intensive</b> <b>farming</b> creates conditions for parasite growth and transmission drastically different from what parasites experience in wild host populations and may therefore alter selection on various traits, such as life-history traits and virulence. Although recent epidemic outbreaks highlight the risks associated with <b>intensive</b> <b>farming</b> practices, most work has focused on reducing the short-term economic losses imposed by parasites, such as application of chemotherapy. Most of the research on parasite evolution has been conducted using laboratory model systems, often unrelated to economically important systems. Here, we review the possible evolutionary consequences of <b>intensive</b> <b>farming</b> by relating current knowledge of the evolution of parasite life-history and virulence with specific conditions experienced by parasites on farms. We show that <b>intensive</b> <b>farming</b> practices are likely to select for fast-growing, early-transmitted, and hence probably more virulent parasites. As an illustration, we consider the case of the fish farming industry, a branch of <b>intensive</b> <b>farming</b> which has dramatically expanded recently and present evidence that supports the idea that <b>intensive</b> <b>farming</b> conditions increase parasite virulence. We suggest that more studies should focus on the impact of <b>intensive</b> <b>farming</b> on parasite evolution in order to build currently lacking, but necessary bridges between academia and decision-makers...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we {{model the}} {{supply and demand}} for {{agricultural}} goods and assess and compare how welfare, land use, and biodiversity are affected under <b>intensive</b> and extensive <b>farming</b> systems at market equilibrium instead of at exogenous production levels. As long as demand is responsive to price, and <b>intensive</b> <b>farming</b> has lower production costs, there exists a rebound effect (larger market size) of <b>intensive</b> <b>farming.</b> <b>Intensive</b> <b>farming</b> is then less beneficial to biodiversity than extensive farming is, except {{when there is a}} high degree of convexity between biodiversity and yield. On the other hand, extensive farming leads to higher prices and smaller quantities for consumers. Depending on parameter values, it may increase or decrease agricultural producer profits. Implementing “active” land sparing by zoning some land for agriculture and other land for conservation could overcome the rebound effect of <b>intensive</b> <b>farming,</b> but we show that farmers have then incentives to encroach on land zoned for conservation, with higher incentives under <b>intensive</b> <b>farming.</b> We also show that the primary effect of the higher prices associated with extensive farming is a reduction of animal feed production, which has a higher price elasticity of demand, whereas less of an effect is observed on plant-based food production and almost no effect is observed on biofuel production if there are mandatory blending policies...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Population growth, {{increasing}} food demands, {{and economic}} efficiency have been major driving forces behind farming intensification over recent decades. However, biological emissions (bioaerosols) from intensified livestock farming {{may have the}} potential to impact human health. Bioaerosols from <b>intensive</b> livestock <b>farming</b> have been reported to cause symptoms and/or illnesses in occupational-settings and there is concern about the potential health effects on people who live near the <b>intensive</b> <b>farms.</b> As well as adverse health effects, some potential beneficial effects have been attributed to farm exposures in early life. The aim {{of the study was to}} undertake a systematic review to evaluate potential for adverse health outcomes in populations living near <b>intensive</b> livestock <b>farms.</b> MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two electronic databases (PubMed and Scopus) and bibliographies were searched for studies reporting associations between health outcomes and bioaerosol emissions related to <b>intensive</b> <b>farming</b> published between January 1960 and April 2017, including both occupational and community studies. Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. Risk of bias was assessed using a customized score. RESULTS: 38 health studies met the inclusion criteria (21 occupational and 1 community study measured bioaerosol concentrations, 16 community studies using a proxy measure for exposure). The majority of occupational studies found a negative impact on respiratory health outcomes and increases in inflammatory biomarkers among farm workers exposed to bioaerosols. Studies investigating the health of communities living near <b>intensive</b> <b>farms</b> had mixed findings. All four studies of asthma in children found increased reported asthma prevalence among children living or attending schools near an <b>intensive</b> <b>farm.</b> Papers principally investigated respiratory and immune system outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The review indicated a potential impact of <b>intensive</b> <b>farming</b> on childhood respiratory health, based on a small number of studies using self-reported outcomes, but supported by findings from occupational studies. Further research is needed to measure and monitor exposure in community settings and relate this to objectively measured health outcomes...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe paper {{analyses}} {{impacts of}} certification schemes on workforce recruitment and working relations in <b>intensive</b> <b>farming.</b> It discusses how migrants’ competence {{may be an}} argument to the recruitment of a foreign group, whereas foreign migrants are rather usually seen as odd-job men in <b>intensive</b> <b>farming.</b> In {{the context of a}} quality policy applied to French Corsican clementine farming, Moroccan labour migrations’ patterns were partly reshaped: farmers managed to obtain a dispensation for Moroccans recruitment, putting forward as a pretext their skills, acquired within long-lasting labour relations. Moroccan migrations participated to Corsican Eastern Plain’s agrarian development, by linking the quality of a labelled commodity into the context of its production, i. e. in relying on Moroccans’ skills, be these so-called or not, hard or soft. This case has thus compelling implications for further research on labour relations studies in <b>intensive</b> <b>farming</b> contexts. It suggests that forms of labour domination could be found and / or explained by a ‘quality turn’ within labelling policies applied to the <b>intensive</b> <b>farming</b> production of a commodity, rather than by productivist logics, as often stated in dominant literature. This research is based on different evidences from a fieldwork carried out in Corsica, France, from 2008 to 2010...|$|R
