5|$|Another way of {{estimating}} {{the age of}} the cluster is by looking at the lowest-mass objects. In normal main-sequence stars, lithium is rapidly destroyed in nuclear fusion reactions. Brown dwarfs can retain their lithium, however. Due to lithium's very low <b>ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> of 2.5 × 106 K, the highest-mass brown dwarfs will burn it eventually, and so determining the highest mass of brown dwarfs still containing lithium in the cluster can give an idea of its age. Applying this technique to the Pleiades gives an age of about 115 million years.|$|E
5|$|By September 1943, {{the values}} of the D-D and T-D had been revised upwards, raising hopes that a fusion {{reaction}} could be started at lower temperatures. Teller was sufficiently optimistic about the Super, and sufficiently concerned about reports that the Germans were interested in deuterium, to ask the Governing Board to raise its priority. The board agreed to some extent, but ruled that only one person could be spared to work on it full-time. Oppenheimer designated Konopinski, who would {{spend the rest of the}} war working on it. Nonetheless, in February 1944, Teller added Stanislaw Ulam, Jane Roberg, Geoffrey Chew, and Harold and Mary Argo to his T-1 Group. Ulam calculated the inverse Compton cooling, while Roberg worked out the <b>ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> of T-D mixtures. Maria Goeppert joined the group in February 1945.|$|E

Experimental results are compared with the predictions of a simple model developed for the description of high temperature combustion of single char particles.

25|$|Pyridine has a {{flash point}} (the lowest {{temperature}} {{at which it}} can vaporize to form an ignitable mixture in air) of only 17°C and is, therefore, highly flammable. Its <b>ignition</b> <b>temperature</b> is 550°C, and mixtures of 1.7–10.6vol% of pyridine with air are explosive. The thermal modification of pyridine starts above 490°C, resulting in bipyridine (mainly 2,2′-bipyridine {{and to a lesser}} extent 2,3′-bipyridine and 2,4′-bipyridine), nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide. Pyridine easily dissolves in water and harms both animals and plants in aquatic systems. The permitted maximum allowable concentration of pyridine was 15–30 parts per million (ppm, or 15–30mg·m−3 in air) in most countries in the 1990s, but was reduced to 5ppm in the 2000s.

40|$|Bridge-mixing' of igniting fuel vapors gasified from {{different}} combustibles by thermal radiation during flashover {{is presented in}} this article.

Sample cubes of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polycarbonate (PC), and wood are tested in a cone calorimeter at high thermal radiative heat fluxes of 50 and 70 kW m 2. Two samples are tested each time. Different arrangements of the fuel tray are made to give different mixing of fuel vapors. It is observed that fuel vapors gasified from combustibles with different <b>ignition</b> <b>temperatures</b> are ignited simultaneously under some mixing conditions, depending on the geometry of the fuel tray under the cone. Mixing of gasified fuel vapors by the fire-induced airflow in rooms of different geometry is a key factor in igniting each combustible item.

40|$|Hot surface oxidations are {{commonly}} thought to involve initial free radical hydrogen atom abstraction. Our evidence implicates initial Lewis base deprotonation by O•- atomic oxygen radical anions to form negatively charged carbanions. Subsequent rate determining electron transfers generate free radicals which only then {{give rise to}} combustion. Correlations regarding <b>ignition</b> <b>temperatures</b> and hydrocarbon oxidation product identity are consistent with carbanionic but not free radical effects. Highly polarized surfaces (e. g., quartz and corroded surfaces), and addition of polar compounds to fuel/air mixtures facilitate ignitions. EFM confirms increased electrostatic intensities at microscopic surface defects. For seemingly uniformly hot surfaces there are transient widely disparate high temperature incandescent “red spot ” zones due to flameless oxidations induced by concentrated electrostatic negative charges at surface defects. Isotope, <b>ignition</b> <b>temperatures</b> and combustion trends are consistent with Seebeck effects (ease of electron migration in unevenly heated areas).

40|$|Tests {{in which}} metals were rubbed against {{themselves}} in oxygen {{have revealed that}} increasing oxygen pressure does not always increase the potential for ignition. It is believed that there exists a specific pressure above which convective heat loss due to higher oxygen density will overcome the potential increase in the oxidation rate afforded by the increase in oxygen pressure. Test results have shown that, once a specific oxygen pressure is exceeded, greater rates of frictional energy were required for ignition of metals as pressure is increased. Other test results have indicated that as oxygen pressure is increased during the rubbing process, the bulk sample equilibrium temperatures decrease. These results support the belief that increases in convective heat loss as pressure is increased can raise the energy requirements for ignition of metals or lower their ignition potentials. Testing has also indicated that, when metals were exposed to a rubbing process and oxygen pressure was increased, metals such as carbon steel exhibited a decrease in their bulk <b>ignition</b> <b>temperatures,</b> whereas metals such as Monel showed bulk <b>ignition</b> <b>temperatures</b> independent of pressure...|$|R

40|$|Bridge-mixing was {{proposed}} earlier {{to explain why}} different combustibles might be ignited simultaneously during flashover.
