25|$|The new Republic, {{created in}} the {{territory}} of the Audencia of Charcas, faced profound problems. The wars of independence had disrupted the economy. The entire mining industry was in decline because of <b>destruction,</b> flooding, <b>and</b> <b>abandonment</b> of mines. Lack of investment and scarcity of labor contributed to a sharp drop in silver production. Agricultural production was low, and Bolivia had to import food, even the basic staples consumed by the Indian population. The government had serious financial difficulties because of the huge military expenditures and debt payments to Peru as compensation for the army of liberation. All these problems were aggravated by the isolation of the new republic from the outside world and the difficulties of securing its borders.|$|R

50|$|Although {{the site}} {{has a long history}} of use—occupied in the Final Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Early Iron Age—the most visible remains are the houses and {{communal}} buildings of Archaic date (600-500 BC). The public buildings of Archaic date cluster close to the peak on the west and south sides of the South Acropolis and cover a total area of over 0.60 hectares. Each produced evidence of <b>destruction</b> <b>and</b> <b>abandonment</b> in the early 5th century BC. This destruction marks the end of the city's life and a long period of occupation. The Archaic rebuilding expanded the settlement to its maximum size (c. 15 hectares), created a zone of communal buildings on the upper west slope of the South Acropolis, and formalized what can be called civic architecture—generally supra-household communal spaces accommodating a variety of possible activities and configurations of groups.|$|E

This ancient Roman site was affected by two earthquakes in the years AD 40 - 60 and AD 260 - 290 which promoted important urban and architectural changes <b>and</b> eventually the <b>destruction</b> <b>and</b> further <b>abandonment</b> of the city in AD 365 - 390. Earthquake Archaeoseismological Effects (EAEs) are catalogued, described and mapped in the entire monumental sector of the city mainly witnessing the last earthquake which occurred in AD 260 - 290. Mapping of oriented EAEs illustrate damage distribution all over the lower sector of the city, as well as the occurrence of suspect coseismic landslide and tsunami events. The structural analysis of oriented EAEs throughout the entire mapped sector suggests that the intervening ground motion was preferentially oriented in a SW to NE direction. The geoarchaeological analysis and some relevant archaeological anomalies, strongly suggest the occurrence of coeval tsunami events during both ancient earthquakes, pointing to the occurrence of an offshore seismic source SSW of the city. Several N-S normal faults have been identified around the Bolonia Bay area and some of them continue offshore SSW of Baelo Claudia. These faults with clear Quaternary activity can be considered as the more probable seismic sources for the events affecting the ancient Roman site and they are consistent with the mapped damage orientation displayed by the structural analysis of EAEs within the old Roman cityEste trabajo ha sido financiado por sucesivos proyectos de investigación en la zona desde el año 2001 y en la actualidad por los Proyectos de Investigación CGL 2015 - 67169 -P (USAL: QTECTSPAIN), CGL 2012 - 37281 -C 02. 01 (USAL: QTECTBÉTICA) y CGL 2012 - 33430 (MNCN, CSIC).

50|$|One room yielded 20 spherical loom weights in the Aegean tradition. This {{building}} {{also produced}} three miniature bronze wheels from a cultic stand {{of a type}} known from Cyprus and reminiscent of the biblical description of the mechonot (laver stands) and a bronze Janus-faced linchpin from a chariot wheel.

In Strata VI and V, the building complex contained a large stone bath, a monolith, two stone pillar bases, and several hearths. In Stratum IV the plan of the building complex was reused and its cultic function continued, as attested by the finds, including a cache of ivory, faience, and stone objects, among them decorated earplugs and a ring depicting the Egyptian goddess Sekhmet.

50|$|Divljana monastery {{survived the}} fall of the Roman Empire, and around it there was a {{permanent}} settlement of pagan Slavs in the Ponišavlje district around 614. But soon after that, Christian life on that location disappeared for the next two centuries, clearly confirming the renewal and reaffirmation of worship in 870 when re-Christianization began. The re-opening of dioceses and parishes was undertaken by the Greek hierarchy of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. All shrines that were in evidence as Christian churches were restored. Since Remesiana had been destroyed, Divljana monastery became a center of this region for an extended period, as can be seen from a charter by Emperor Basil II from 1019. The temple has survived much rebuilding. In one reconstruction, elements in the Byzantine style were taken. This region was the center of Christianity in Ponišavlje until the Turks arrived, leading to its <b>destruction</b> <b>and</b> <b>abandonment.</b> Before the devastation, the monastery owned 1200 ha of land as well as Prnjavor (an earlier name for the village of Divljana) which covered another 800 ha.|$|E

5000|$|Free Dacians are {{reported}} to have invaded and ravaged the Roman province in 214 and 218. Several emperors after Trajan, as late as AD 336, assumed the victory title of Dacicus Maximus (" [...] Grand Dacian [...] "): Antoninus Pius (157), Maximinus I (238), Decius (250) Gallienus (257), Aurelian (272) and Constantine I the Great (336). Since such victory-titles always indicated peoples defeated, not geographical regions, the repeated use of Dacicus Maximus implies the existence of ethnic Dacians outside the Roman province in sufficient numbers to warrant major military operations into the early 4th century. The permanent deployment of a massive Roman military garrison, normally of 2 legions and over 40 auxiliary regiments (totaling ca. 35,000 troops, or about 10% of the imperial army's total regular effectives), also implies a grave threat to Roman Dacia throughout its history, between 106 and 275. There is substantial archaeological evidence of major and devastating incursions into Roman Dacia: clusters of coin-hoards and evidence of the <b>destruction</b> <b>and</b> <b>abandonment</b> of Roman forts. Since these episodes coincide with occasions when emperors assumed the title Dacicus Maximus, {{it is reasonable to}} suppose that the Free Dacians were primarily responsible for these raids.|$|E
