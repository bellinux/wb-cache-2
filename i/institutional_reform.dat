A safer proportion aimed at reducing the overall ratio among Indochina's colonial troops of 1:1 ethnic Vietnamese to European and indigenous ethnic minorities (Montagnards) was implemented. This demonstrated French distrust of Vietnamese troops and the apparent belief that the fidelity of Vietnamese soldiers was maximised by creating a racial balance within the army that was tilted towards showing all Vietnamese soldiers – and thereby the Vietnamese population at large – the futility of attempting insurrection and mutiny.|$|E

In 1925 he became involved with the Muhammadiyah, rising quickly through the leadership until he became the head of the Surabaya branch in 1938. He was also active in local politics. When a group of Islamic organisations formed the Indonesian Islamic Assembly in 1937, Fakih became treasurer. He continued to be involved in politics and Islamic groups during the Japanese occupation and ensuing national revolution. While serving as minister of religious affairs, he oversaw educational and <b>institutional</b> <b>reform,</b> growing in prominence within the Muhammadiyah. He served as deputy chairman of the organisation under several different leaders before being chosen as its chairman in late 1968, several days before his death.|$|E

40|$|Following their {{political}} and economic independence in 1989, a group of ten Central and Eastern European countries (CEEs) embarked on major <b>institutional</b> <b>reforms</b> to modernise their economies {{in order to become}} an integral part of the global economy. This chapter provides an overview of the main <b>institutional</b> <b>reforms</b> undertaken in the CEEs and their effects on export competitiveness. The chapter focuses on selected meso and macro <b>institutional</b> <b>reforms,</b> namely price liberalisation, competition policy, trade and foreign exchange, privatisation, and corporate governance. The results show that <b>institutional</b> <b>reforms</b> in the CEEs were rapid and generally successful. All CEEs became members of the European Union (EU) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). <b>Institutional</b> <b>reforms</b> contributed significantly to improved efficiency and growth in the export sector. The results also suggest that further reforms are needed to improve competition policy and corporate governance, both of which are still below the standards found in Western industrialised countries...|$|R

40|$|The {{policy changes}} and {{structural}} reforms in transition economies {{over the past}} two decades have created exogenous variations in institutional development, which offers us an ideal natural experiment to analyse the causal effects of institutions on bank risk-taking behaviour. This paper examines a wide array of <b>institutional</b> <b>reforms</b> in respect of law and legal institutions, banking liberalization, and enterprise restructuring in privatization and corporate governance. Using a difference-in-difference approach, we find that banks’ financial stability has increased substantially subsequent to the <b>institutional</b> <b>reforms.</b> Further analysis suggests that the enhancement of financial stability mostly comes from the reduction of asset risk. Moreover, the effects of <b>institutional</b> <b>reforms</b> on bank risk are more pronounced for domestic banks than foreign banks. From the policy consideration, our study sheds light on the risk implications of different <b>institutional</b> <b>reforms</b> that have been characterizing transition countries. institutional development; bank risk; transition banking; foreign ownership...|$|R

25|$|The {{party was}} {{the brainchild of}} a group of discontented Western {{interest}} groups who were upset with the PC government and the lack of a voice for Western concerns at the national level. Leading figures in this movement included Ted Byfield, Stan Roberts, Francis Winspear, and Preston Manning. A major intellectual impetus at the time was provided by Peter Brimelow's 1986 book, The Patriot Game. They believed the West needed its own party if it was to be heard. Their main complaints against the Mulroney government were its alleged favouritism towards Quebec, lack of fiscal responsibility, and a failure to support a program of <b>institutional</b> <b>reform</b> (for example, of the Senate). The roots of this discontent lay mainly in their belief that a package of proposed constitutional amendments, called the Meech Lake Accord, failed {{to meet the needs of}} Westerners and Canadian unity overall.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{argue that}} even the US is still {{struggling}} to attain the income level necessary to prioritize certain environmental pollutants such as carbon emissions, which have yet to follow the EKC. With other pollutants however, like sulfur dioxide, production seems to coincide with a country's economic development and at a certain threshold level of income a mitigation of environmental damage occurs. This could be related rather than causal, because economic growth without <b>institutional</b> <b>reform</b> does not accomplish this environmental improvement. It appears that with GDP growth, government policies are strengthened and populations experience a rise in their demand for improved environmental quality. It may be the case, however, that regulation in relatively wealthy countries simply shifts the production and pollution to less-regulated, poorer countries; if this were true, the total size of the negative externalities of production remains the same or is larger, though in the wealthier country an EKC {{appears to have been}} obtained.|$|E

This safer proportion aimed at an overall ratio among Indochina's colonial troops of 1:1 ethnic Vietnamese to European and indigenous ethnic minorities (Montagnards). The measures demonstrated the French distrust of Vietnamese troops and the apparent belief that the fidelity of Vietnamese soldiers was maximised by creating a racial balance within the army that was tilted towards showing all Vietnamese soldiers – and thereby the Vietnamese population at large – the futility of attempting insurrection and mutiny.|$|E

40|$|The {{positive}} effects of trade liberalisation on several dimensions of poverty have initiated studies of the trade-poverty relationship. Trade liberalisation accompanies <b>institutional</b> <b>reforms</b> that help to reduce institutional barriers against the poor. This study examines the impacts of trade openness and <b>institutional</b> <b>reforms</b> on rural household welfare at the provincial level through {{the analysis of the}} determinants of welfare of rural households in Vietnam. The study employs a model of micro-determinants of growth and tests it on the data from the Vietnam Household Living Standards Surveys (VHLSSs) of 2006 and 2010. What makes the study different from some other studies of the same vein is that it attempts to directly capture the institutional effect on welfare. The study finds that, in the provinces with high <b>institutional</b> <b>reforms</b> and trade openness, the welfare of rural households improved. <b>Institutional</b> <b>reforms</b> in Vietnam appeared to be sluggish in the late 2000 s. In particular, both access to land and lower informal charges were the important determinants of welfare improvement over time. These findings suggest that Vietnam should maintain its development by accelerating the process of <b>institutional</b> <b>reforms,</b> thereby helping poor households to improve standards of living.

25|$|Some {{attempts}} at reforming {{the structure of}} the science curriculum were made during the 18th century and {{the first decades of the}} 19th century. Beginning around 1745, the Hats party in Sweden made propositions to reform the university system by separating natural philosophy into two separate faculties of physics and mathematics. The propositions were never put into action, but they represent the growing calls for <b>institutional</b> <b>reform</b> in the later part of the 18th century. In 1777, the study of arts at Cracow and Vilna in Poland was divided into the two new faculties of moral philosophy and physics. However, the reform did not survive beyond 1795 and the Third Partition. During the French Revolution, all colleges and universities in France were abolished and reformed in 1808 under the single institution of the Université imperiale. The Université divided the arts and sciences into separate faculties, something that had never before been done before in Europe. The United Kingdom of the Netherlands employed the same system in 1815. However, the other countries of Europe did not adopt a similar division of the faculties until the mid-19th century.|$|E

Tourism, agriculture and trade are not enough to create sustainable, growing wealth for the whole country. If Greece is to make growth progress within the group of Euro-zone countries, it must move beyond <b>institutional</b> <b>reforms.</b> As we argue, it needs to focus on policy measures that support an innovation driven economy in combination with the necessary <b>institutional</b> <b>reforms.</b> As we will show, there exists a base for such a model.|$|R
