After the opening of Danville's Community Arts Center in 2004, Ernst Crown-Weber, a local businessman, renamed the event Constitution Square 5K Run for the Arts and began {{organizing}} <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> {{to raise money for}} the center. A local artist, Alison Craig, designs original awards to be presented to the winners.|$|E
5|$|Lewis {{argues that}} Applewhite {{effectively}} controlled his followers by packaging his teachings in familiar terms. Richard Hecht of the University of California, Santa Barbara, echoes this sentiment, arguing {{that members of}} the group killed themselves because they believed the narrative that he had constructed, rather than because he psychologically controlled them. In his 2000 study of apocalyptic movements, John R. Hall posits that they were motivated to commit suicide because they saw <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to demonstrate that they had conquered the fear of death and truly believed Applewhite.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Levesque's {{role as an}} Executive Senior Advisor {{was officially}} formalized as he was given an office at WWE {{headquarters}} in Stamford, Connecticut. Levesque was named Executive Vice President, Talent and Live events in 2011. In this role he oversees the talent relations and talent development departments, training of performers and management of worldwide recruitment. Levesque's role within {{the company has been}} under much criticism since 2003, as many fans and some wrestlers view <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to keep him on top on-screen and to give him more television time. Levesque has spoken against this criticism and has denied all of it. Additionally, Levesque has been credited for losing in high-profile matches that helped elevate the careers of younger wrestlers including John Cena, Randy Orton, Batista, Jeff Hardy, Brock Lesnar, Daniel Bryan and Roman Reigns.|$|E

5|$|Several {{terrestrial}} starlings, {{including those}} in the genus Sturnus, have adaptations of the skull and muscles that help with feeding by probing. This adaptation is most strongly developed in the common starling (along with the spotless and white-cheeked starlings), where the protractor muscles responsible for opening the jaw are enlarged and the skull is narrow, allowing the eye to be moved forward to peer {{down the length of}} the bill. This technique involves inserting the bill into the ground and opening <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of searching for hidden food items. Common starlings have the physical traits that enable them to use this feeding technique, which has undoubtedly helped the species spread far and wide.|$|E
5|$|In early March 1705 the Russian Field Marshal Boris Sheremetyev set up {{a meeting}} with the Saxon general Otto Arnold von Paykull in order to agree to a common course of action in the ensuing campaign. The basis for the {{strategy}} was a plan developed by Johann Patkul as early as 1703, which envisioned a joint strike which would neutralize the Swedish army. von Paykull, inspired by Patkul's blueprint, advocated <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to lure Charles and the main Swedish army out of Greater Poland eastward towards Brest-Litovsk. This was to be accomplished by having the combined forces of the main Russian army under Ogilvy and von Paykull's troops stationed at Brest, which would force Charles to meet them in battle. At the same time the main Saxon army would attack Charles from the rear by sweeping through Poland out of Saxony, ultimately catching the Swedish army exposed. The plan seemed rather daring to Patkul and he suggested that the allies should first crush Lewenhaupt's army, before Ogilvy's troops approached Charles. Otherwise Ogilvy's rear would be threatened. A compromise was made between the two strategies and it was decided that Sheremetyev should engage Lewenhaupt {{at the same time as}} Ogilvy marched towards the strongly fortified city of Grodno. The belief was that there, behind fortifications, Oglivy would be able to withstand Charles long enough for the main Saxon army to arrive from Kraków. Meanwhile, von Paykull would attack with his combined Saxon–Polish force towards Warsaw in order to interrupt the coronation of Stanisław I.|$|E
25|$|March {{organizers}} themselves disagreed {{over the}} purpose of the march. The NAACP and Urban League saw it as a gesture of support for a civil rights bill that had been introduced by the Kennedy Administration. Randolph, King, and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) saw <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of raising both civil rights and economic issues to national attention beyond the Kennedy bill. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) saw <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of challenging and condemning the Kennedy administration's inaction and lack of support for civil rights for African Americans.|$|E

25|$|Since Buddhist {{practice}} also encompasses practical wisdom, spiritual {{virtues and}} morality, it cannot {{be said to}} be just another form of psychotherapy. It is more accurate to see <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of life or a way of being (Dharma).|$|E

25|$|Another two {{wings of}} the jail were {{demolished}} after India achieved independence.

At a meeting on 16 April 1938 between Sir Nevile Henderson, the British Ambassador to Germany, and Hermann Göring, the latter stated {{it had never been}} valued in England, and he bitterly regretted that Herr Hitler had ever consented to it at the time without getting anything in exchange. It had been a mistake, but Germany was nevertheless not going to remain in a state of inferiority in this respect vis-à-vis a hostile Britain, and would build up to a 100 per cent. basis.|$|E

25|$|Across {{town from}} Posey, Gus Greenlee, a reputed gangster and numbers runner, had just {{purchased}} the Pittsburgh Crawfords. Greenlee's main interest in baseball {{was to use}} <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to launder money from his numbers games. But, after learning about Posey's money-making machine in Homestead, he became obsessed with the sport and his Crawfords. On August 6, 1931, Satchel Paige made his first appearance as a Crawford. With Paige on his team, Greenlee took a huge risk by investing $100,000 in a new ballpark to be called Greenlee Field.

25|$|M'ba did {{not have}} an idealist vision of his job; he saw <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to become wealthy. With his {{colleague}} Ambamamy, he forced labour on the residents of the canton for his personal use, to cover his large expenditures. The colonial administration was aware of the embezzlement, but they chose to overlook it. However, beginning in 1929, the colonial administration started to investigate his activities after they intercepted one of his letters to a Kouyaté, secretary for the Ligue des droits de l'homme, who was accused of being an ally of the Comintern. Despite this suspected Communist alliance, the French authorities did not oppose M'ba's appointment as head chief of the Estuaire Province by his colleagues.|$|E
25|$|The West's {{exposure}} to Annam and Annamese {{exposure to}} Westerners dated back to 166 AD {{with the arrival}} of merchants from the Roman Empire, to 1292 with the visit of Marco Polo, and the early 16th century {{with the arrival of}} Portuguese in 1516 and other European traders and missionaries. Alexandre de Rhodes, a French Jesuit priest, improved on earlier work by Portuguese missionaries and developed the Vietnamese romanized alphabet Quốc Ngữ in Dictionarium Annamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum in 1651. Various European efforts to establish trading posts in Vietnam failed, but missionaries were allowed to operate for some time until the mandarins began concluding that Christianity (which had succeeded in converting up to a tenth of the population by 1700) was a threat to the Confucian social order since it condemned ancestor worship as idolatry. Vietnamese attitudes to Europeans and Christianity hardened as they began to increasingly see <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of undermining society.|$|E
