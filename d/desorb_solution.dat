40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the potential regeneration of natural zeolite which had been contaminated with lead and zinc contained in aqueous solutions, treated secondary effluent and primary treated wastewater. Several <b>desorbing</b> <b>solutions</b> were examined for the removal of Pb(II) and Zn(II) from zeolite and the highest desorption efficiency was obtained for 3 M KCl and 1 M KCl, respectively. The desorption process depended on the type and concentration of the <b>desorbing</b> <b>solution,</b> the metal being desorbed, the mineral selectivity towards the metal and the composition of the liquid medium where the adsorption process had taken place. Successive regeneration cycles resulted in the reduction of desorption efficiency by more than 50 % after 9 and 4 cycles for lead and zinc, respectively. Kinetics examination showed that desorption was slower than adsorption, while metal ions which had been easily adsorbed were difficult to be desorbed. Adsorption was characterized by a three-stage diffusion process, while desorption followed a two-stage diffusion process. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe term “wrong-way-round ionization” {{has been}} used in studies of {{electrospray}} ionization to describe the observation of protonated or deprotonated ions when sampling strongly basic or acidic solutions (respectively) where such ions are not expected to exist in appreciable concentrations in solution. Study of the dependence of ionization of the weak base caffeine on the electrospray capillary potential reveals three distinct contributors to wrong-way-round ionization. At near-neutral pH in solutions of low ionic strength, protonation of caffeine results from the surface enrichment of electrolytically produced protons in the surface layer of the droplets from which ions are <b>desorbed.</b> For <b>solutions</b> made strongly basic with ammonia, gas-phase proton transfer from ammonium ions can create protonated caffeine. These two mechanisms have been discussed previously elsewhere. For solutions of high ionic strength at neutral or high pH, the data suggest that discharge-induced ionization is responsible for the production of protonated caffeine. This mechanism probably accounts for some of the wrong-way-round ionization reported elsewhere...|$|R

40|$|Hydrogen {{storage is}} a {{significant}} challenge for the development and viability of hydrogen-powered vehicles. Storage of molecular hydrogen in nitrogen-substituted polyunsaturated aromatic organic molecules through reversible catalytic hydrogenation and dehydrogenation is a promising approach. The success of developing a catalytic hydrogen storage concept is highly dependent on finding an efficient catalyst; however, understanding how molecules interact with metal catalytic sites is, at present, rather limited. In this work, a combined experimental and theoretical study is conducted to identify efficient catalytic sites on metallic surfaces and to understand the reaction mechanism for the forward hydrogenation reaction. It is clearly revealed from experimentation that hydrogenation of N-ethylcarbazole, a typical nitrogen-substituted polyunsaturated aromatic organic molecule, {{is taking place in}} a stepwise manner over metal catalysts. Because of steric constraints at terrace sites, the kinetically stable pyrrole intermediate, formed by partial hydrogenation of N-ethylcarbazole, cannot be readsorbed once <b>desorbed</b> into <b>solution.</b> Therefore further hydrogenation occurs at the low coordinated sites where no similar steric hindrance is encountered. Thus, the mechanism for hydrogenation involves an unusual shuttling of partially hydrogenated intermediates from terrace sites to higher indexed sites via solution. First-principles calculations confirm that the pyrrole intermediate can strongly adsorb to various low coordination sites, typically steps on the vicinal (109) surface, while the adsorption is extremely weak on flat (001) terraces. This work is the first example of catalytic site analysis to account for observed activity, selectivity and recyclability of a typical metal catalyst for catalytic hydrogen storage, which could lead to rational design of superior materials. © 2010 American Chemical Society...|$|R
40|$|Metal {{contamination}} {{in the environment}} {{is one of the}} persisting global issues since it not only disturbs the environmental quality, but also the environment and human health. The major contribution to this problem arises mainly from anthropogenic activities such as industries. Metal scarcity has become more severe lately where some elements have been predicted to be eradicated from the earth crust in several decades. Recently, researchers have focused their attention to recover these metals from the waste stream and reuse it in industrial production processes. The use of agricultural wastes as a potential low cost adsorbent for heavy metal removal from wastewater {{is one of the most}} versatile technologies. In this study among the different adsorbents tested, groundnut shell gave high removal efficiencies with fewer requirements for further post treatment for Cu, Pb and Zn removal. Furthermore, the batch experiments on the main effects of process parameters (pH, adsorbent dosage, contact time and initial metal concentration) showed a major effect on the metal uptake and removal efficiency. For material regeneration, 0. 2 M HCl was the most effective <b>desorbing</b> <b>solution</b> that did not alter the efficiency, up to three adsorption and desorption cycles. The use of sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) in bioreactors is another technology that can be applied for the treatment of metal contaminated wastewater. The SRB reduce sulfate into sulfide which further reacts with metals to form metal sulfide precipitates. The inverse fluidized bed (IFB) bioreactor is a configuration which shows prominence in utilizing SRB technology for metal contaminated wastewater treatment. Two IFB bioreactors were operated at different pH (7. 0 and 5. 0). The sulfate reducing activity (SRA) at pH 7. 0 was higher than at pH 5. 0, illustrating that pH is the main factor that affects SRA. However, thiosulfate showed a higher efficiency than sulfate as an alternate electron acceptor. The sulfide produced using thiosulfate as the electron acceptor was 157. 0 mg/L, while only 150. 2 mg/L was produced using sulfate and it required an adaptation period at pH 5. 0 prior to successful operation. Moreover, the IFB showed a high efficiency for Cu, Ni and Zn removal from synthetic wastewater. The removal of Cu and Zn was more than 90 % at pH 7. 0 and 5. 0 at an initial metal concentration of 25 mg/L. On the other hand, Ni was not removed at an initial concentration of 25 mg/L, as it exerted toxic effects towards SRB. There are various types of metal contaminated waste streams which pose as a good candidate for metal recovery include electronics waste (e-waste). This e-waste has a high potential as secondary source of metal to recover especially base metals such as Cu, Ni and Zn. Printed circuit boards (PCBs) of personal computers were evaluated as the potential secondary source of Cu, Ni and Zn using hydrometallurgical and sulfide precipitation methods. The optimal conditions for metal leaching were 0. 1 M HNO 3 with a liquid to solid ratio of 20 using PCBs of 0. 5 - 1. 0 mm particle size at 60 °C, which resulted in 400 mg Cu/g PCBs. With sulfide precipitation at a stochiometric ratio of 1 : 1 (Cu:S 2 -), the recovery of Cu was very effective up to 90 % from the leachate which accounted to approximately 0. 41 g Cu/g PCBs, while Ni and Zn recovery were, respectively, 40 % (0. 005 g Ni/g PCBs) and 50 % (0. 006 g Zn/g PCBs) from the leachate in an upflow leaching column...|$|R

The utilized composite was treated with 0.01  N H 2 SO 4 which brought about to 93.6 % stripping of Pb 2 +. The adsorption capacity was totally continued after the recovery of acid-treated sorbent. In the second cycle, the material could now remove 95.4 % Pb 2 + that could be desorbed up to 94 %. In the third cycle, 96.4 % adsorption and 92.6 % desorption were conceivable (Fig.  7 d).

Investigations of the surfactants were carried out with regard to pH, ionic strength, temperature, the addition of short chain aliphatic alcohols, the addition of sacrificial complexing agents and various ion-exchanged forms of kaolin. The various forms of kaolin were synthesised to simulate the effect of clay contact with sea water and/or formation water. To try and understand the surfactant solution more fully {{an attempt was made}} to determine the number of bound Ca 2 + ions and A 13 + ions using an ion-selective electrode and atomic adsorption spectroscopy techniques. The results of the adsorption experiments show that monolayer coverage of the kaolin takes place, and the minimum adsorption is favoured by the following conditions: high pH, low ionic strength and elevated temperatures. The presence of butan-l-ol and sodiwn citrate are also beneficial. In the presence of high ionic strength solutions, the anionic surfactant may also be lost due to salt formation with the metal ion present and hence be precipitated from solution. In the absence of the short chain alcohols the adsorption isotherms of the anionic surfactants can be said! at low concentrations « 10 - 3 mol dm- 3), to be due to electrostatic interactions between the edge of the clay particles and the charged surfactant.

The results imply that biomolecule desorption at our conditions is a single step process involving laser heating of the solvent above its supercritical temperature, a rapid expansion, ion recombination and finally isolation and desorption of only a small fraction of preformed ions and charged aggregates. In addition, we report an investigation of the aqueous solution concentration and pH-dependence of the laser induced desorption of protonated species (monomers and dimers). The experimental findings suggest that the desorption process depends critically upon the proton affinity of the molecules, the concentration of other ions, and of the pH value of the solution. Therefore the ion concentrations measured in the gas phase very likely reflect solution properties (equilibrium concentrations). Arginine self-assembles large non-covalent singly protonated multimers (n = 1 [...] . 8) when sampled by IR laser induced water beam desorption mass spectrometry. The structures of these aggregates may resemble those of the solid state and may be preformed in solution prior to desorption.

Heat was added to the ammonia-water through a thin wall, above which flowed heat transfer oil in a separate branching fractal-like microchannel array. Such arrays have been shown to utilize the increased heat transfer coefficients seen in parallel channel arrays; however, they do so with a lower pressure drop. An experimental flow loop consisting of ammonia-water and heat transfer oil sub-loops was instrumented along with a test manifold for global measurements to be taken. Temperature, pressure, density and mass flow rate measurements permitted calculation of desorption and heat transfer characteristics. Parameters included oil mass flow rate, oil inlet temperature, and strong solution flow rate, while strong solution concentration, temperature, and weak solution pressure were kept constant. The desorber was assumed to achieve equilibrium conditions between the vapor and weak solution in the separation chamber. The exit plenum was large and acted as a flash chamber, making the assumption reasonable. The vapor mass fraction was determined from knowledge of the weak solution saturation temperature. Heat exchanger analyses (LMTD and ε-NTU) were done to determine the heat transfer characteristics of the desorber.

We also characterized the adsorption of polymerase at the oil-water interfaces of droplets and identified a surfactant to prevent the loss of polymerase in solution. The pendant drop technique was used to observe the change in interfacial tension due to adsorption of Taq Pol and/or surfactants to the interface. PCR performance of two surfactants, Brij L 4 and ABIL EM 90, were predicted from equilibrium interfacial tension measurements. Brij L 4, a surfactant that had never been used with PCR, prevented polymerase adsorption and enabled more efficient PCR than ABIL EM 90, a popular PCR surfactant. Lastly, we ambitiously designed a system to conduct droplet PCR without oil or surfactants. Droplets were generated on-chip by adapting a co-flow droplet generating device previously developed in our group. Then droplets were immobilized on-chip in hydrodynamic traps. Two different modes of trapping were demonstrated, indirect and direct. Also, all aspects of an air continuous phase droplet PCR device were considered such as protein adsorption to channel walls and droplet evaporation during thermal cycling...|$|R
30|$|Previous {{studies have}} found long, lower copper {{concentration}} {{to be more effective}} than short pulse exposures (Knauer et al. 1997; Campbell et al. 2002; Angel et al. 2015). Much of this work has been done with ionic copper exposures such as from copper sulfate. Copper bound from copper sulfate can readily <b>desorb</b> back into <b>solution</b> and thereby not become internalized to elicit a response (Angel et al. 2015). Copper sulfate is subject to active transport mechanisms (Sunda and Huntsman 1998) and thereby is predicted to take a longer duration to pass the algal cell surface and require longer exposure durations to increase performance. It is predicted the reversible binding nature of adsorbed copper would be accentuated by short exposure durations (<[*] 3  h) in canal treatments as this provides less contact time with the algal surface and rapid decrease in external aqueous concentrations. Angel et al. (2015) found rapid desorption or release of copper sulfate back into solution following a pulse exposure and overall less copper internalization. However, data comparing formulations showed that chelated copper with surfactant continued to drive internalization even after copper exposure ceased (Bishop et al. 2018). This would support findings from the current study and also reports of less efficacy observed in field canal systems following copper sulfate use. Conversely, chelated copper can have an enhanced ability to pass through the algal cell wall and membrane due to the charge properties (Stauber and Florence 1987), and this internalized copper is less likely to be released into solution (Kuyucak and Volesky 1989; Yan and Pan 2002). Surfactants and adjuvants further can increase this interaction with the algal cell and assist in internal transfer (Closson and Paul 2014; Ullah et al. 2015). Bishop et al. (2017) found pulsed exposures (1 – 4  h) of Captain XTR can be effective at controlling a nuisance mat-forming algae, although require a proportional increase in concentration at lower durations (i.e., exposure factor). Chelated copper provides more rapid copper internalization than copper sulfate and should be highly considered in short duration exposures such as through canal systems (Bishop 2016). The measured efficacy of short pulse (less than 3  h) exposures of Captain XTR as found in this research would not be expected when compared to results from other another study with copper sulfate (Angel et al. 2015). This finding further confirms that formulations of copper algaecides substantially differ in behavior and effectiveness.|$|R
40|$|Using four New Zealand soils, it {{was found}} that pH, {{extractable}} Al, citrate-dithionite-bicarbonate-Al, oxalate Fe, and crystalline Fe appeared to be important soil properties in both P and Mo sorption. Allophane appeared less important in the sorption of Mo than in the sorption of P. For the sorption of Mo, the initial, rapid removal of Mo was followed by a slow, continuing removal of Mo from solution. An estimate of equilibrium Mo concentration was obtained by extrapolation of the relationship between solution Mo and 1 /t to 1 /t = 0, i. e. t = ∞. The effect of ionic strength on Mo sorption appeared to be kinetically controlled at low final Mo concentrations (10 µmol l- 1). Isotherms for the sorption of Mo by both topsoils and subsoils, at equilibrium and 40 hr, and by synthetic hydrous ferric oxide gel (Fe gel) and allophane at 40 hr, could be described by three Langmuir equations. Values for the free energies of sorption for each region of sorption, which were remarkably similar for the different sorbents, indicated that sorption in regions I and II corresponded to chemisorption reactions, whereas sorption in region III involved a more-physical type of sorption. Fe gel appeared to be a satisfactory model for Mo sorption by soils. Isotherms for the sorption of P by the four soils, Fe gel, and allophane during 40 hr were described by three Langmuir equations. Because the free energies of sorption for each region, for both Mo and P, were very similar, the sites for sorption and types of sorption reaction for both anions are probably similar. Synthetic allophane chemisorbed much less Mo than P, relative to Fe gel, and this was attributed to kinetic charge effects. Sorption of Mo by Fe gel in each region was affected differently by changes in pH and ionic strength, and the charge relationships for each region were also different. These data, along with the three distinct free energies of sorption obtained for Mo, suggested that three distinct sorption reactions were involved. The data suggested that sorption of Mo in regions I and II involved ligand-exchange chemisorption of MoO 42 - for -OH 2 + and -OH, respectively, resulting in the formation of a bidentate complex. Sorption in region III was considered to involve sorption at a plane distant from the sorbing surface. The Langmuir equation developed to describe competitive sorption was not obeyed for Mo and P, but the sorption of Mo, in the presence of P, could be described by three simple Langmuir equations. It appeared that Mo and P competed for similar surface sites. Solution P increased the amounts of sorbed Mo that could be desorbed, relative to Cl. The amounts of Mo desorbed by both Cl and P decreased with time after addition of Mo to soils. This was attributed Mo suggested that the absorption of adsorbed Mo was also occurring. For several soils to which Mo had been added in the field, no Mo was <b>desorbed</b> by P <b>solutions.</b> Solution:soil ratio affected only the rate at which P was removed from solution, not the final equilibrium concentrations. Incubating soil with P prior to the addition of Mo reduced both chemisorption and more-physical sorption of Mo. For a soil that had received annual additions of phosphate and lime for 22 yr, the chemisorption of added Mo was reduced by both fertilizer P and lime, whereas the more-physical sorption maxima were only reduced by lime additions. The results were discussed in terms of both the persistence and plant-availability of Mo added in the field situation...|$|R
40|$|In New Zealand, {{phosphate}} fertiliser use {{has resulted}} in an accumulation of cadmium (Cd) in some pasture soils, and {{has led to an}} elevation in Cd concentrations in pasture species growing on these soils. While there is an abundance of literature on the soil chemistry of Cd, there is shortage of data dealing with low soil Cd concentrations that are relevant to New Zealand soils, typically < 1. 5 µg Cd g⁻¹ soil. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine some of the factors that affect the phytoavailability of Cd in soils at the low Cd concentrations relevant to New Zealand conditions, and to ultimately identify management strategies to minimise Cd uptake into plants. In a study using six soils to investigate the effect of soil pH on sorption/desorption of both native and added Cd, it was revealed that with increasing pH (between pH 4. 9 - pH 6. 2) there was a substantial reduction in the concentration of both native and added Cd desorbed from soils using 0. 01 M Ca(NO₃) ₂. Conversely it was found that there was an increase in the amount of added Cd sorbed as pH increased from 4. 9 to 6. 2. Soil organic carbon was also identified as playing an important role in controlling sorption and desorption of Cd. Regression analysis using a larger set of soils (29), indicated that soil pH, organic carbon and total soil Cd were the most dominant soil variables controlling Cd solubility. In addition, the same three soil parameters were important for governing desorption of native Cd into soil solution. Soil pH and organic carbon were important in the sorption Cd, while CEC along with soil pH were important in controlling added Cd desorption. In addition, increasing soil pH was shown in a glasshouse study to significantly decrease plant Cd concentrations, in five different plant species. There was evidence of immobilisation of Cd in soils as a result of increased contact time between the soil and added Cd. Results from an incubation study, where Cd was added to the soil as Cd(NO₃) ₂, revealed that for four very different soils, there was a decrease in the concentration of Cd <b>desorbed</b> into <b>solution</b> using 0. 01 M Ca(N 0 ₃) ₂with an increasing contact period of up to 70 days prior to desorption. Additional evidence of Cd immobilisation with contact time was derived from a long-term superphosphate trial, where Cd had been added to soil, fertiliser application ceased and the same soil re-sampled 21 years later. Results from the trial indicated that during this 21 year hiatus, the proportion of Cd in soluble forms, as determined by a chemical fractionation, decreased, while there was an increase in Cd in residual fractions. A study of the same soil which had received annual superphosphate fertiliser application for 44 years, revealed through chemical fractionation, that there was an increase in Cd associated with the exchangeable and organic fractions with time, however there was still a substantial proportion of Cd in non-available residual forms. Similarly, for 12 topsoil samples in a separate study, while there was a wide range in the concentrations of Cd associated with individual soil fractions, the greatest concentration of Cd was associated with the organic and residual fractions, with substantial proportions of Cd added as a result of fertiliser application present in the residual, and presumably non-phytoavailable, fraction. In a glasshouse study, the concentrations of Cd in a number of vegetable, pasture, and cereal species was investigated. Plant Cd concentrations varied greatly between different plant species and soil types. All plants were within the maximum residue limit (MRL) for the Cd content of all foodstuffs intended for human consumption. In an evaluation of soil extractants that are commonly used to predict plant Cd concentrations, it was found that a unbuffered or neutral extractant such as CaCl₂, NH₄OAc, or Ca(N 0 ₃) ₂ which was sensitive to soil pH was a suitable predictor of plant Cd concentrations. An investigation into the rate of Cd accumulation in soil from a long-term (44 yr) superphosphate fertiliser trial was carried out. Results indicated that there had been a significant accumulation of Cd in soil that has been subject to long term superphosphate fertiliser application relative to the control plot. On the high fertiliser treatment (376 kg superphosphate ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹), Cd was estimated to have accumulated at a rate of 7. 8 g ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹. There was also evidence of movement of Cd down the soil profile in this irrigated soil. This study has identified several management options available for the control of Cd phytoavailability in soils. The maintenance of a soil pH within a target range of 5. 8 - 6. 0 will not only increase sorption of Cd but will decrease desorption of Cd and reduce Cd solubility. The adoption of farming practices which maintain adequate organic matter levels in the soil should be encouraged. The selection of P fertilisers with low Cd concentrations is to be promoted to reduce soil Cd concentrations. Finally, as a management strategy, a 'hands off' approach may be suitable given that there seems to be fixation of Cd in soil with increased residence time...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{tropical}} peat {{soils are}} unsuitable for cultivation of commercial crops {{because of their}} innate high acidity, high organic matter contents and low concentrations of essential nutrients. Lime is commonly applied to increase the soil pH prior to planting but this practice may affect the availability of nutrients. Deficiency of micronutrients, in particular copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn), has been reported, {{but there is still}} a lack of information on the behaviour and bioavailability of these micronutrients in tropical peat soils. The aims of this thesis were therefore to study the adsorption and desorption reactions of Cu and Zn in tropical peat soils of Sarawak, Malaysia and evaluate the effects of added Cu and Zn to correct the micronutrient deficiency problems in the soils. The adsorption and desorption of Cu and Zn in three untreated (control) and limed soils were studied. The soils were sampled from three locations in Sarawak and were all characterised by low pH, low bulk density, high organic matter content and low concentrations of available macro- and micronutrients. For the limed soils, calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) was used to increase the soil pH to 5. 5. Both Cu and Zn adsorption followed a curvilinear (Freundlich) trend with binding affinity decreasing with concentrations of added Cu and Zn in all soils. At the same initial spiked concentrations, the adsorption of Cu and Zn were 50 and 67 times higher, respectively, in limed soils compared to that of controls. The three soils behaved similarly in relation to sorption of both Cu and Zn. The Freundlich coefficients (KF values) for Cu in control and limed soils were higher than those of Zn, indicating stronger solid phase sorption of Cu than Zn. The KF values for Cu and Zn were higher than those reported for mineral soils, but were similar to those reported for other tropical peat soils, suggesting that the efficiency of micronutrient Cu and Zn fertilisers would be low, and therefore fertiliser requirements for optimal crop production would be high. Desorption of adsorbed Cu and Zn was assessed using 10 mM calcium nitrate (Ca(NO₃) ₂) and 5 mM diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA). DTPA <b>solution</b> <b>desorbed</b> about 60 % more Cu and Zn than Ca(NO₃) ₂ solution. Copper was more effectively desorbed by DTPA than Zn, as Cu has a higher critical stability constant with DTPA. The percentage of adsorbed Cu desorbed by DTPA was lower in limed soils than in control soils, indicating that added Cu in limed soils will be less labile and bioavailable. By contrast, the percentage of adsorbed Zn desorbed by DTPA was higher in limed soils than in control soils. This is likely due to the possible changes in Zn speciation with increasing soil pH. The response of a tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) var. Tiny Tom to application of Cu and Zn as basal fertilisers was also assessed. Using the Mitscherlich model, yield responses were found to correlate well with the rates of added Cu and Zn. The shoot growth of tomato plants in fertilised soils was significantly (P ≤ 0. 05) enhanced by the application of Cu and Zn fertilisers in all three soils. Leaf Cu and Zn concentrations were also significantly (P ≤ 0. 05) increased. Responses to applied Zn were greater than those to applied Cu, and addition of Cu also increased Zn concentrations in tomato leaves and vice versa. This suggests a Zn ‘hidden’ response may exist when Cu fertiliser is added to these soils, since the addition of Cu probably displaces native Zn adsorbed to soil surfaces in these peat soils. As the rate of added micronutrients increased, concentrations of Cu in plant shoot material were much more regulated than those of Zn. Critical Cu and Zn concentrations in plant shoot to achieve 90 % maximum yield were 16 - 21 mg/kg and 90 - 96 mg/kg, respectively, greater than those reported for tomato grown in other soil types. Critical concentrations for DTPA-extractable Cu and Zn in soil to achieve 90 % maximum yield in the three soils were 1. 6 - 2. 9 and 3. 5 - 3. 6 mg/kg, respectively. The values for DTPA extractable Cu were within the range of the published critical values in other soil types. However, the critical concentrations of DTPA-extractable Zn were higher than the published critical values. These values {{can be used as a}} guide for fertiliser Cu and Zn recommendations on tropical peat soils in Sarawak. Thesis (M. Ag. Sc.)
