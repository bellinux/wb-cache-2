40|$|BACKGROUND <b>Intravenous</b> {{regional}} <b>anaesthesia</b> (IVRA, Bier’s block). is {{a simple}} regional anaesthesia technique in which analgesia and muscle relaxation are produced by the injection of an adequate volume of local anaesthetic solution or a mixture of solution containing local anaesthetic and additive drugs like muscle relaxants, opioids, NSAIDS or an intravenous anaesthetic into a vein of an extremity(to be operated on) with inflow and outflow of blood prevented by a proximally applied tourniquet. <b>Intravenous</b> regional <b>anaesthesia</b> is an effective and simple method of producing extremity block. The technique was introduced by August Bier in 1908 and is known as Bier’s block.

40|$|<b>Intravenous</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> is {{gradually}} becoming popular in veterinary practice. Traditionally, general anaesthesia is induced with intravenous drugs and then maintained with inhalation agents. Inhalation anaesthetic agents cause more significant dose-dependent cardiorespiratory depression than intravenous anaesthetic drugs, creating {{a need to}} use less of the inhalation anaesthetic agents for maintenance of general anaesthesia by supplementing with <b>intravenous</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> drugs. Better still, if anaesthesia is maintained completely with intravenous anaesthetic drugs, autonomic functions remain more stable intra-operatively. Patient recovery from anaesthesia is smoother and there is less pollution of the working environment than happens with inhalation anaesthetic agents. Recently, a number of drugs with profiles (pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic) suitable for prolonged <b>intravenous</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> have been studied, mostly in humans and, to a certain extent, in dogs and horses. There is currently very little scientific information on total <b>intravenous</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> in goats, although, {{in the past few}} years, some scholarly scientific articles on drugs suitable for partial <b>intravenous</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> in goats have been published. This review article explored the information available on drugs that have been assessed for partial <b>intravenous</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> in goats, with the aim of promoting incorporation of these drugs into total <b>intravenous</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> protocols in clinical practice. That way, balanced anaesthesia, a technique in which drugs are included in anaesthetic protocols for specific desired effects (hypnosis, analgesia, muscle relaxation, autonomic stabilisation) may be utilised in improving the welfare of goats undergoing general anaesthesia.

The following parameters were monitored before administration of anaesthesia (T 0), then after 15 (T 1), and 30 minutes (T 2) : systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure; heart rate; concentration of tele-exhaled carbon dioxide (PetCO 2) and percentage of peripheral saturation of haemoglobin (SPO 2); bleeding according to the Fromme-Boezaart scale at T 2. Mean arterial pressure values were maintained between 60 - 70 mmHg throughout surgery. At T 0, systolic arterial pressure, diastolic arterial pressure and mean arterial pressure values were seen to overlap in the two groups. Both types of anaesthesia were effective in reducing the pressure values of T 0 -T 1 and T 1 -T 2 trends (p< 0. 0001). Systolic arterial pressure at T 1 is lower with total <b>intravenous</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> compared to isoflurane and fentanyl (p= 0. 02).

A total of twelve patients scheduled to undergo short procedures of upper limb were taken for this study. After exsanguination and tourniquet application on the arm 1. 5 mg/kg of preservative free lignocaine as 0. 5 % solution was injected into the cannulated radial artery. The onset of analgesia was 89. 92 ± 17. 54 seconds.

40|$|Background the {{technique}} called one-lung ventilation can confine bleeding or infection to one lung, prevent rupture of a lung cyst or, more commonly, facilitate surgical {{exposure of the}} unventilated lung. During one- lung ventilation, anaesthesia is maintained either by delivering a volatile anaesthetic to the ventilated lung or by infusing an intravenous anaesthetic. It {{is possible that the}} method chosen to maintain anaesthesia may affect patient outcomes. Objectives the objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of <b>intravenous</b> versus inhalation <b>anaesthesia</b> for one- lung ventilation. Search strategy We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 3), MEDLINE, LILACS, EMBASE (from inception to June 2006), ISI web of Science (1945 to June 2006), reference lists of identified trials, and bibliographies of published reviews. We also contacted researchers in the field. There were no language restrictions. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials and quasi- randomized controlled trials of <b>intravenous</b> versus inhalation <b>anaesthesia</b> for one-lung ventilation. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. Main results We included nine studies that enrolled 291 participants. We could not perform meta-analyses as the included studies did not report the outcomes listed in the protocol for this review.

40|$|Introduction Elderly {{patients}} who have solid organ cancer often receive surgery. Some of them may develop delirium after surgery and delirium development is associated with worse outcomes. Furthermore, despite all of the advances in medical care, the long-term survival in cancer patients is far from optimal. Evidences suggest that choice of anaesthetics during surgery, that is, either inhalational or intravenous anaesthetics, may influence outcomes. However, the impact of general anaesthesia type on the occurrence of postoperative delirium is inconclusive. Although retrospective studies suggest that propofol-based <b>intravenous</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> was associated with longer survival after cancer surgery when compared with inhalational anaesthesia, prospective studies as such are still lacking. The purposes of this randomised controlled trial are to test the hypotheses that when compared with sevoflurane-based inhalational anaesthesia, propofol-based <b>intravenous</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> may {{reduce the incidence of}} early delirium and prolong long-term survival in elderly patients after major cancer surgery. Methods and analysis This is a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial with two parallel arms. 1200 elderly patients (≥ 65 years but < 90 years) who are scheduled to undergo major cancer surgery (with predicted duration ≥ 2 [*]hours) are randomised to receive either sevoflurane-based inhalational anaesthesia or propofol-based <b>intravenous</b> <b>anaesthesia.</b> Other anaesthetics and supplemental drugs including sedatives, opioids and muscle relaxants are administered in both arms according to routine practice. The primary early outcome is the incidence of 7 -day delirium after surgery and the primary long-term outcome is the duration of 3 -year survival after surgery. Ethics and dissemination The study protocol has been approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committees of Peking University First Hospital (2015 [869]) and all participating centres.

40|$|Propofol and methohexitone were {{evaluated}} as hypnotics {{in a total}} <b>intravenous</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> technique without nitrous oxide in 50 patients of ASA grade 1 or 2. Analgesia was provided by a constant alfentanil infusion {{and the depth of}} anaesthesia was controlled by varying the infusion rate of propofol or methohexitone. Induction and intubation responses were smooth and moderate in the propofol group and side effects were few. Control of depth of anaesthesia, blood pressure and pulse rate was relatively easy in this group but more difficult and sometimes inadequate in the methohexitone group, in which side effects were more frequent. The mean infusion rate for propofol was 0. 12 mg/kg/minute, similar to those found in studies using nitrous oxide without an opioid. Recovery times were short in both groups but those in the propofol group tended to be shorter. Postoperatively 96 % of the propofol patients were clear-headed within 20 minutes, in contrast to only 48 % in the methohexitone group.

40|$|The {{induction}} {{and maintenance}} of anaesthesia with ether using a combined intravenous infusion and a constant low inspired concentration are described.

Ether {{is still the most}} commonly used anaesthetic agent in many countries in spite of the disadvantages of the explosion risk, a slow and difficult induction, and the stimulation of secretions, vomiting and laryngeal spasm. Artusio (1954) reported that complete analgesia and amnesia may be obtained at ether concentrations below the explosion limit. One of us (R. G. -M.) has confirmed the report by Artusio (1954) that surgical anaesthesia may be obtained at an expired concen-tration of 1. 8 vol % using air-ether mixtures or 1. 0 vol % using oxygen-nitrous oxide-ether mixtures. By administering ether i. v., and avoiding the risk of explosion, it was possible to reach this concentration rapidly. <b>Intravenous</b> ether <b>anaesthesia</b> was first described by Burkhardt (1909 a, b).
