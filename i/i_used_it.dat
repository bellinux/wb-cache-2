500|$|Neuromancer {{was written}} on a [...] "clockwork typewriter," [...] the very one you may recall glimpsing in Julie Deane's office in Chiba City. This machine, a Hermes 2000 manual portable, dates {{from somewhere in the}} 1930's. It's a very tough and elegant piece of work, from the factory of E. PAILLARD & Cie S.A. YVERDON (SUISSE). Cased, it weighs {{slightly}} less than the Macintosh SE/30 I now write on, and is finished in a curious green- and-black [...] "crackle" [...] paint-job, perhaps meant to suggest the covers of an accountant's ledger. Its keys are green as well, of celluloid, and the letters and symbols on them are canary yellow. (I once happened to brush the shift-key with the tip of a lit cigarette, dramatically confirming the extreme flammability of this early plastic.) In its day, the Hermes 2000 {{was one of the best}} portable writing-machines in the world, and one of the most expensive. This one belonged to my wife's step-grandfather, who had been a journalist of sorts and had used it to compose laudatory essays on the poetry of Robert Burns. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>it</b> first to write undergraduate Eng. lit. papers, then my early attempts at short stories, then Neuromancer, all without so much as ever having touched an actual computer.|$|E
500|$|When {{he retired}} from the NHL, Vanbiesbrouck took over as the head coach and {{director}} of hockey operations for the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds. In February 2003, the team had a record of 18-24-4-3. A month later on March 7, the Greyhounds lost 6–1 to the Guelph Storm. After the game Vanbiesbrouck used a racial slur in expressing his anger with Trevor Daley (now with the Detroit Red Wings), a black player and Greyhounds' team captain, to two of Daley's white teammates. Daley was told of the remarks by his teammates and was advised to leave the team by his agent Bobby Orr. Daley returned home to Toronto and informed the commissioner of the OHL about the remarks. The day after Daley left the team, Vanbiesbrouck resigned his positions as coach and general manager, and sold his ownership stake in the team. In his apology Vanbiesbrouck stated [...] "I used the 'N' word instead of calling him Trevor, <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>it</b> just not thinking. It's a mistake and consequences have to be paid by me, I've embarrassed everybody and my family by this one comment. It's not what they represent and it's not what the Sault Greyhounds organization represents." [...] He added [...] "I told Trev this is an old wound with me, I grew up with it. I'm as sorry as anybody that it's stuck with me." [...] Daley returned to the team three days after leaving, but Vanbiesbrouck never returned to a coaching position.|$|E
500|$|De Fratus is {{a devout}} Roman Catholic who, {{though he was}} raised in a large Catholic family, {{struggled}} with his faith after an injury early in his career, but ultimately determined the injury was a gift from God to help him better understand his faith: [...] "I really feel that the setback was God telling me, ‘Hey you are not done. [...] You are not done yet figuring out what you need to figure out, and I am {{going to give you a}} little more time.’ [...] There is a big reason why that injury happened and I feel that <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>it</b> as best as I could have." [...] He noted that he would like to take classes at a seminary to help proselytize to others. Early in his professional career, he struggled to find fellow Catholics, and noted that most of his teammates were either Protestants or not religious. Moreover, in many small towns that house minor league teams, there are no Catholic churches, so De Fratus found it easy to slide away from leading a Catholic lifestyle. However, upon realizing that there is more to life than material success, he discovered a need for God, and has thus developed his faith. Aside from his faith, he enjoys writing and recording music, and playing the guitar. He has two brothers, the older of whom, Steve, played in the minor leagues, and the younger of whom, Chris, caught a foul ball during De Fratus's major league debut.|$|E

[...] Munsell goes on to state, after encountering a series of unintelligible images that despite refreshing [...] "Again, and again, and again. The captchas were not only difficult for a computer to read, but impossible for a human." [...] Munsell then provided numerous examples.|$|E

But <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>it</b> {{for lack of a better}} word. Since then, I've been schooled by thousands of incest survivors all across the world that there really is no such thing as consensual incest due to the inherent power a parent has over a child.

2500|$|His soundtracks for the Streets of Rage series (known as Bare Knuckle in Japan) from 1991 to 1994 were {{composed}} using then outdated PC-8801 hardware alongside his own original audio programming language. According to Koshiro: [...] "For Bare Knuckle I used the PC88 and an original programming language I developed myself. The original was called MML, Music Macro Language. It {{is based on}} NEC's BASIC program, but I modified it heavily. It was more a BASIC-style language at first, but I modified it to be something more like Assembly. I called it ‘Music Love'. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>it</b> for all the Bare Knuckle games." ...|$|E
2500|$|Every {{morning before}} {{beginning}} work, I visited the animals. One of the elephants, Candy, loved to be scratched on the belly behind her foreleg. I'd scratch {{her and she}} would lean farther and farther toward me until there was some danger of her toppling over on me. One time I started {{to walk away from}} her, and she reached out and took my wrist with her trunk and pulled me back to her side. It was a command: [...] "Don't stop!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>it</b> in the picture. Noah scratches the elephant's belly and walks away, and the elephant pulls him back to her time after time.|$|E
2500|$|He {{has used}} Fender Stratocaster guitars almost exclusively. His black 1957/63 (the body {{is from a}} '63; the neck from a '57) Stratocaster, {{previously}} owned by late Free guitarist Paul Kossoff, was used circa 1978–1990. It {{was used as a}} template by Fender to manufacture an Artist Signature model in 2009. The original now resides at his mother's home. [...] "I bought it in 1976," [...] he said. [...] "I saw it advertised in Melody Maker… I got the serial number to check it was [...] guitar. It cost quite a bit of money but I didn't care. I just sold everything I had so I could get it, and <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>it</b> from then on. It just felt like I was holding a piece of magic because he had used this guitar." ...|$|E

2500|$|On December 28, 2001, he was {{prosecuted for}} the {{violation}} of Stimulant Drugs Control Law. He testified that, [...] "I used drugs {{to get rid of}} stress and tension before appearing on a TV program" [...] for the investigation by Tokyo District Prosecution Office. He also said, [...] "I lived confined to the house and I began to worry. From about this April, <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>it</b> once every few days". According to an indictment, he warmed amphetamine over a fire and absorbed it in his home's video room. [...] His first trial for drug use and other crimes was in Tokyo District Court on February 1, 2002. Judgement was given on the case in the same court on February 8, 2002, where he was found guilty. However, he was given 3 years suspended sentence of 2 years imprisonment.|$|E
2500|$|I {{was curious}} why a {{high-ranking}} official in President Bill Clinton's National Security Council (NSC) was given this assignment. Wilson {{had become a}} vocal opponent of President Bush's policies in Iraq after contributing to Al Gore {{in the last election}} cycle and John Kerry in this one. During a long conversation with a senior administration official, I asked why Wilson was assigned the mission to Niger. He said Wilson had been sent by the CIA's counter-proliferation section at the suggestion of one of its employees, his wife. It was an offhand revelation from this official, who is no partisan gunslinger. When I called another official for confirmation, he said: [...] "Oh, you know about it." [...] The published report that somebody in the White House failed to plant this story with six reporters and finally found me as a willing pawn is simply untrue. At the CIA, the official designated to talk to me denied that Wilson's wife had inspired his selection but said she was delegated to request his help. He asked me not to use her name, saying she probably never again will be given a foreign assignment but that exposure of her name might cause [...] "difficulties" [...] if she travels abroad. He never suggested to me that Wilson's wife or anybody else would be endangered. If he had, I would not have used her name. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>it</b> in the sixth paragraph of my column because it looked like the missing explanation of an otherwise incredible choice by the CIA for its mission.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{spent the}} Fall quarter (of 1950) at RAND. My first {{task was to}} find a name for {{multistage}} decision processes. An interesting question is, Where did the name, dynamic programming, come from? The 1950s were not good years for mathematical research. We had a very interesting gentleman in Washington named Wilson. He was Secretary of Defense, and he actually had a pathological fear and hatred of the word research. I’m not using the term lightly; I’m using it precisely. His face would suffuse, he would turn red, and he would get violent if people used the term research in his presence. You can imagine how he felt, then, about the term mathematical. The RAND Corporation was employed by the Air Force, and the Air Force had Wilson as its boss, essentially. Hence, I felt I had to do something to shield Wilson and the Air Force from the fact that I was really doing mathematics inside the RAND Corporation. What title, what name, could I choose? In the first place I was interested in planning, in decision making, in thinking. But planning, is not a good word for various reasons. I decided therefore to use the word “programming”. I wanted to get across the idea that this was dynamic, this was multistage, this was time-varying. I thought, let's kill two birds with one stone. Let's take a word that has an absolutely precise meaning, namely dynamic, in the classical physical sense. It also has a very interesting property as an adjective, and that it's impossible to use the word dynamic in a pejorative sense. Try thinking of some combination that will possibly give it a pejorative meaning. It's impossible. Thus, I thought dynamic programming was a good name. It was something not even a Congressman could object to. So <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>it</b> as an umbrella for my activities." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked whether}} the series would feel as [...] "adult" [...] as Jessica Jones, Colter replied, [...] "if you think Jessica is adult then we’re still keeping up with that pace ... we’ll {{continue}} along those lines of PG-16+". On whether Luke Cage would address current race issues, including Black Lives Matter, given the character's past (a wrongfully imprisoned black man), Colter said, [...] "this {{is not necessarily the}} platform to hit it head on" [...] but [...] "the things that he's going through will ring true {{for a lot of people}} in law enforcement" [...] and on the street. Loeb said on the issue, [...] "Luke Cage, when he came on the scene in the early 70s was for all intents and purposes the first black superhero. Given what’s going on present day, it just resonates." [...] Coker stated that Cage is [...] "someone that the community can touch and go to", adding, [...] "There’s never been a time in history where having a bulletproof black man" [...] has been so important. Luke Cage was also the first MCU property to use the word [...] "nigger" [...] or [...] "nigga", with Marvel having complete trust in Coker's use of it: the word is used casually in the series, though some characters, including Cage, prefer not to use it. Coker said the intent was never to use it [...] "in a way where it's flippant. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>it</b> from the standpoint of, if we were going to eavesdrop on a conversation with African American people, with nobody else around, when would this word be used and how would it get used." [...] Coker also likened the use in the series to [...] "the way music used to treat it," [...] not having it be [...] "every other word of every other chorus, because at that point, it just gets silly." ...|$|E
