5|$|Nevertheless, other historians like Masahiro Yamamoto {{have argued}} that the death {{sentence}} was too severe a penalty for Matsui's crime of mere negligence in failing to stop the massacre. The journalist Richard Minear also points out that Matsui's penalty was disproportionately severe compared to the other convicted defendants. Kuniaki Koiso was found guilty on four counts and Mamoru Shigemitsu was found guilty on five counts, in both cases including one count of negligence, and both were given prison sentences. Matsui, by contrast, was found guilty of only one count of negligence but was sentenced to death. The historian Tokushi Kasahara argues that the prosecution at the IMTFE did not attempt seriously to investigate all those {{who were involved in the}} Nanking Massacre, and instead <b>just</b> <b>decided</b> to make Matsui the sole scapegoat for the whole atrocity.|$|E

The season concluded with four friendly games at Kaufbeuren, Eichstätt, 1. FC Magdeburg, and Fortuna Sittard, all won by Munich.|$|E

Colbert was frequently pitted against knowledgeable interview subjects, or against Stewart in scripted exchanges, with the resultant dialogue demonstrating the character's lack of knowledge of whatever subject he is discussing. Colbert also made generous use of humorous fallacies of logic in explaining his point of view on any topic. Other Daily Show correspondents have adopted a similar style; former correspondent Rob Corddry recalls that when he and Ed Helms first joined the show's cast in 2002, they [...] "just imitated Stephen Colbert for a year or two".

The events it focused on were how both Swift and Anderson fell in love for the first time, but both suffered of heartbreaks. Aside from reminiscing on the events she and Anderson experienced, Swift wrote cautionary lyrics, intended to target teenage girls entering or already in their freshman year of high school. She described it as incorporating things she wished someone would have told her in a song when she was younger. [...] "The thing about high school, you don't know anything.

[...] "Ferris Bueller is about the week before you leave school, it's about the end of school—in some way, it doesn't have a sequel. It's a little moment and it's a lightning flash in your life.

Ruffalo also backed up his director's methods when he said, [...] "The way I see it is, you enter into someone else's world as an actor.
