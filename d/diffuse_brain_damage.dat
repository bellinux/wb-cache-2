50|$|Epileptic encephalopathies are a {{group of}} {{conditions}} that result in deterioration of sensory, cognitive, and motor functions due to consistent epileptic activity. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a childhood epileptic encephalopathy characterized with generalized seizures and slow spike-wave activity while awake. LGS {{is a combination of}} atonic absences, tonic seizures, cognitive deterioration, and slow spike-wave activity in the EEG. This syndrome usually results from focal, multifocal, or <b>diffuse</b> <b>brain</b> <b>damage</b> and can be divided into symptomatic and cryptogenic types. Cognitive deterioration with high-frequency spike-wave activity affects most patients 2-9 years old with generalized seizures. The age of onset for LGS is between 1 and 10 years, between 2 and 6 years for symptomatic cases and 5 and 8 years for cryptogenic cases. Episodes can be triggered by modifications of treatment, which usually involves benzodiazepines, or changes in the conditions of life.|$|E

Magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) {{has proved to be}} a sensitive tool for detecting <b>diffuse</b> microscopic <b>brain</b> <b>damage</b> in NPSLE patients. In this study we examined the correlation between grey and white matter magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) parameters and the presence of IgM and IgG aCLs and lupus anticoagulant in 18 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and a history of NPSLE but without cerebral infarcts on conventional magnetic resonance imaging. Lower grey matter mean MTR (P < 0. 05), white matter mean MTR (P < 0. 05), white matter peak location (P < 0. 05) and grey matter peak location (trend toward statistical significance) were observed in IgM aCL-positive patients than in IgM aCL-negative patients. No significant differences were found in MTR histogram parameters with respect to IgG aCL and lupus anticoagulant status, nor with respect to anti-dsDNA or anti-ENA (extractable nuclear antigen) status. This is the first report of an association between the presence of aCLs and cerebral damage in grey and white matter in NPSLE.

40|$|International audienceOBJECT: While {{occurrence}} of motor cortical reorganization has been clearly demonstrated {{in patients with}} multiple sclerosis (MS), {{it is not yet}} clear whether this cortical reorganization constitutes a response to cortico-spinal lesions or to more diffuse damage affecting the neuronal network involved in motor act preparation, or both. We proposed to investigate the changes in the activation pattern during a simple motor task devoid of cortico-spinal dysfunction occurring in patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) suggestive of MS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among 15 right-handed CIS patients, we selected eight patients with a preserved central motor pathway established by motor evoked potentials. Ten healthy right-handed gender- and age-matched volunteers were also included. After morphological MRI, subjects performed calibrated conjugated finger flexion and extension movements during fMRI acquisition. RESULTS: In CIS patients, simple movements of the non-dominant hand induced recruitment of the anterior cingulate cortex (BA 32) usually involved in complex motor movements. This reorganization was correlated with the <b>diffuse</b> <b>brain</b> tissue <b>damage</b> (<b>brain</b> T lesion load). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that {{at least part of the}} cortical reorganization observed during very simple tasks in the earliest stage of MS occurs whether or not the efferent pathways are intact...|$|R

40|$|Blast-associated shock wave-induced {{traumatic}} brain injury (bTBI) remains a persistent risk for armed forces worldwide, yet its detailed pathophysiology remains to be fully investigat-ed. In this study, we have designed and characterized a laboratory-scale shock tube to de-velop a rodent model of bTBI.

40|$|Callosal agenesics and callosotomized epileptics {{manifest}} markedly increasing simple visual {{reaction time}} (SVRT) from conditions of ipsilateral to contralateral stimulus-response relation (SRR). In the contralateral SRR, a response is presumed {{possible because of}} presence of other commissures (anterior, intercollicular). The SRR effect is prolonged presumably because the remaining commissures are less efficient than the corpus callosum in relaying necessary visual or motor information. Consequently, the SRR effect is believed to correspond to callosal relay time (CRT) in the normal subject. However, both callosal agenesics and callosotomy patients manifest general slowing of SVRT {{in addition to a}} prolonged SRR effect. These patients have massive extra-callosal damage which could plausibly cause both the SVRT and the CUD prolongation. If such were the case, the CRT inference would be in jeopardy. A test of the CRT inference is therefore required where patients with massive <b>diffuse</b> extra-callosal <b>brain</b> <b>damage</b> and normal callosi would show marked general SVRT prolongation and a normal SRR effect.

The following research questions are addressed: (a) Does the neuropsychological key classify brain damaged and non-brain damaged subjects at a level significantly above chance? (b) Among the brain damaged subjects, does the neuropsychological key identify right brain damage, left brain damage and <b>diffuse</b> <b>brain</b> <b>damage</b> at an accuracy level significantly above chance? (c) Is the neuropsychological key approach superior to the empirical model derived from discriminant function analysis in predictive accuracy? The neuropsychological key correctly classifies 90 % of the cases as brain damaged and 90 % of the cases as non-brain damaged, {{for a total of}} 89. 9 % predictive accuracy. The obtained Kappa coefficient of. 74 is statistically significant.

Anesthetized rabbits were exposed once to a sagittal rotational acceleration head and neck injury at either a high or a low load level, using either flexion or extension. A high-load extension trauma induced scattered meningeal petechial hemorrhages and no deaths, {{in contrast to a}} flexion trauma of the same level, which resulted in extensive parenchymal and meningeal hemorrhages, and all animals succumbed immediately. A low-level flexion trauma induced scattered meningeal petechiae, but no gross damage, while extension at the same force generated no macroscopically visible acute brain injury. Immunohistochemical investigations carried out at 7 days disclosed that a low-level flexion trauma, as well as both low- and high-level extension exposures, all induced <b>diffuse</b> <b>brain</b> injuries in the cerebral cortex and white matter, corpus callosum, hippocampus, brainstem, and cerebellum, as revealed by abnormal distribution of neurofilaments, a prevalence of b-amyloid precursor protein, and astrogliosis.

Materials and Forty-six infants with neonatal HI {{were enrolled in}} this Methods: prospective study, after approval by the local ethical committee and informed consent of the parents. Neonatal MR imaging ranged from 1 to 45 days after birth. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was measured in 14 brain regions. DW and conventional images were qualitatively scored for abnormalities, resulting in cumulative scores and patterns of damage. Surviving infants were scored for motor outcome {{at the age of}} 2 years, and outcome was classified as poor if the motor score was less than 70 or in case of death. Analyses were performed for the whole group, with additional analyses for the early (0 - 4 days after birth) and late (> 4 days after birth) imaging groups. Results: Twenty-five infants had a good outcome and 21 had a poor outcome. Only in the early imaging group, the infants with poor outcome had significantly lowered ADC values in several brain areas, with the posterior limb of the internal capsule being the most predictive (Wald score = 5. 7; P =. 017). Cumulative scores of DW imaging were the best predictor of poor motor outcome at the age of 2 years (Wald score = 7. 2, P <. 01).

We present a case-control study of 36 patients with post-traumatic pleiosomnia, defined by an increased sleep need of at least 2 h per 24 h after traumatic brain injury, compared to 36 controls. We assessed detailed history, sleep-activity patterns with sleep logs and actigraphy, nocturnal sleep with polysomnography and daytime sleep propensity with multiple sleep latency tests. Actigraphy recordings revealed that traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients had longer estimated sleep durations than controls (10. 8 h per 24 h, compared to 7. 3 h). When using sleep logs, TBI patients underestimated their sleep need. During nocturnal sleep, patients had higher amounts of slow-wave sleep than controls (20 versus 13. 8 %).
