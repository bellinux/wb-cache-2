40|$|Cotton wool spots (CWSs) {{comprise}} localised accumulations of axoplasmic debris within adjacent {{bundles of}} unmyelinated ganglion cell axons. Their formation is widely held to reflect focal ischaemia from terminal arteriolar occlusion, but credible evidence supporting {{this view is}} lacking. CWSs are here purported {{to be nothing more}} than sentinels of retinal nerve fibre layer pathology, hence their recommended redesignation “cotton wool sentinels. ” After branch arteriolar occlusion, CWSs evolve as boundary sentinels of infarction, their uniform width suggesting a glial constraint to axonal expansion. In pre-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, CWSs form a C-shaped chain nasal to the disc and around the macula where they constitute sentinels of ischaemia affecting the entire retinal mid-periphery. The polymorphous CWSs evolving during acute panretinal hypoperfusion represent sentinels of an ischaemic penumbra. Those surrounding the disc in Purtscher’s traumatic angiopathy are sentinels of neuronal damage from transient venous hyperdistension that overwhelms the protection afforded by peripapillary axonal <b>decompartmentalisation...</b>|$|E
40|$|Acute lung injury (ALI) is {{a severe}} {{inflammatory}} lung disease with high mortality. Previous studies revealed several important concepts in ALI, including cellular interaction between lung-marginated leukocytes and pulmonary endothelium, and <b>decompartmentalisation</b> of soluble mediators. However, there are inherent limitations within both in vivo and in vitro models {{to identify the}} detailed mechanism underlying these concepts. In this PhD project, we attempted to address these unanswered questions, using an in situ isolated perfused mouse lung (IPL). Specifically, we aimed to 1) develop, characterise, and optimise the mouse IPL model; 2) investigate soluble and cellular aspects of two models of ALI that are particularly amenable to study using the IPL, namely ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and ischaemia-reperfusion injury. From a physiological viewpoint, VILI consists of 2 primary components, high-stretch and atelectasis. Modelling atelectasis-related injury in vivo is difficult due to negative pleural pressure. We {{took advantage of the}} zero pleural pressure of open-chest IPL system to develop an atelectasis-related VILI model. Comparison of this ‘atelectrauma’ and a high-stretch ‘volutrauma’ model demonstrated that both cause lung oedema and pulmonary inflammation, but the inflammatory impact was different between them. Volutrauma, but not atelectrauma, facilitated systemic cytokine release, in which lung-marginated monocytes seem to play an important role. This finding in the VILI model drove us to further investigate the role of these monocytes in an ischaemia-reperfusion model, which is clinically highly relevant and simulates a lung transplantation setting. Our results suggested that lung-marginated monocytes may also contribute to develop ischaemia-reperfusion injury, potentially involving TNF upregulation. Through this PhD project, we have successfully developed a technically very challenging mouse IPL model. We utilised the unique features of the IPL to develop experimental models that we believe will be strong tools to fill the gap between in vivo physiological significance and in vitro mechanistic understanding.

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the effects of}} controlled atmosphere (CA) and temperature on glucosinolate (GLS) levels in broccoli. Gas exchange rates were measured in three climate rooms with twelve containers each holding 20 randomly selected broccoli (cv ` 1997 ¿) taken from one large batch of broccoli during a three-week period. Broccoli heads were stored at three temperatures and subjected to four levels of O 2 and three levels of CO 2. GLS were measured on individual broccoli heads using a HPLC-based protocol. Information about the GLS development over time was extracted by analysing `replicate¿ broccoli containers (containers stored at the same temperature and gas conditions) that were removed periodically during the storage period. The most striking feature was the large variation in GLS concentrations at harvest with the propagation of variation over time clearly affected by CA and temperature. Decay of the four most important GLS over time was described by a sigmoid model based on the <b>decompartmentalisation</b> of the enzyme myrosinase that hydrolyses GLS. Gas exchange parameters were estimated using the standard gas exchange model; {{the parameters of the}} GLS decay were estimated using a batch model that {{describes the}} propagation of the GLS variation as function of O 2, CO 2, time, temperature, the average biological age and biological variation (88 %). This approach was used to study the effect of regular and modified atmosphere conditions on GLS keeping quality. Storage under regular atmosphere during chain simulation showed that the keeping quality for all four GLS is between four and seven days, while storage under 1. 5 kPa O 2 and 15 kPa CO 2 showed a keeping quality of at least 14 d, indicating that to preserve the nutritional quality of broccoli, MA packaging is a viable optio...|$|E
