5|$|Ben Ammi Ben-Israel {{established}} the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem in Chicago, Illinois, in 1966, {{at a time}} when black nationalism was on the rise {{as a response to the}} Civil Rights Movement. In 1969, after a sojourn in Liberia, Ben Ammi and about 30 Hebrew Israelites moved to Israel. Over the next 20 years, nearly 600 more members left the United States <b>for</b> <b>Israel.</b> As of 2006, about 2,500 Hebrew Israelites live in Dimona and two other towns in the Negev region of Israel, where they are widely referred to as Black Hebrews. In addition, there are Hebrew Israelite communities in several major American cities, including Chicago, St. Louis, and Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, the {{regional}} master franchise <b>for</b> <b>Israel,</b> Orgad Holdings, decided {{to close its}} operations in that country and merge all operations with its own local chain, Burgeranch. It was claimed by Ograd owners Eli and Yuval Orgad that Israelis preferred {{the taste of the}} local brand over the American chain. One blogger, a former manager of a Burger King in the United States, claimed that both chains were basically the same in product and preparations, it was Burger King's failure to fully adapt to the local market tastes that doomed them in that country. By 6 September 2010 all 55 locations in the country were closed down and converted to Burgeranches.|$|E

5|$|Lilly became {{interested}} in chemicals as a teen. In 1854, while {{on a trip to}} visit his aunt and uncle in Lafayette, Indiana, the sixteen-year-old Lilly visited Henry Lawrence's Good Samaritan Drug Store, a local apothecary shop, where he watched Lawrence prepare pharmaceutical drugs. Lilly completed a four-year apprenticeship with Lawrence to become a chemist and pharmacist. In addition to learning to mix chemicals, Lawrence taught Lilly how to manage funds and operate a business. In 1858, after earning a certificate of proficiency from his apprenticeship, Lilly left the Good Samaritan to work <b>for</b> <b>Israel</b> Spencer and Sons, a wholesale and retail druggist in Lafayette, before moving to Indianapolis to take a position at the Perkins and Coons Pharmacy.|$|E
5|$|The {{motion was}} {{rejected}} by 5 votes to 7 after discussions. According to Benny Morris, the arguments that were advanced not to launch the attack were: the negative international repercussions <b>for</b> <b>Israel</b> already accentuated by the recent assassination of Count Bernadotte; the consequences of an attack on an agreement with Abdallah; the fact that defeating the Arab Legion could provoke a British military intervention because of Britain and Jordan's common defense pact and lastly because conquering this area would add {{hundreds of thousands of}} Arab citizens to Israel.|$|E
5|$|Then, late in 1983, the U.S. {{government}} made a financial commitment to help Israel develop its own new fighter, the IAI Lavi. Northrop objected to this, as the Lavi {{would be a}} potential competitor to the F-20 in the export market; while Northrop had to privately fund the F-5G, the government was directly subsidizing a foreign competitor. Congressional support <b>for</b> <b>Israel</b> overruled Northrop's complaints along with complaints from other branches of the government.|$|E

5|$|While interned in Quebec {{he joined}} a {{communist}} discussion group led by Hans Kahle. Kahle was a KPD member who had fought in the Spanish Civil War. After fleeing to Britain with his family, Kahle had helped Jurgen Kuczynski organise the KPD in Britain. Kristel arranged <b>for</b> <b>Israel</b> Halperin, the brother-in-law {{of a friend of}} hers, Wendell Furry, to bring Fuchs some magazines. Max Born lobbied for his release. On Christmas Day 1940, Fuchs and Kahle were among the first group of internees to board a ship to return to Britain.|$|E
5|$|Dissident {{success was}} mixed. Jews wanting to emigrate from the Soviet Union in the 1970s formed the most successful, and most organised, {{dissident}} movement. Their {{success can be}} attributed to the movement's support abroad, most notably from the Jewish community in the United States. In addition, as a group they were not advocating a transformation of Soviet society; the Jewish dissident movement was simply interested in leaving the Soviet Union <b>for</b> <b>Israel.</b> The Soviet Government subsequently sought to improve diplomatic ties with the First World by allowing the Jews to emigrate. The emigration flow was reduced dramatically as Soviet–American tension increased in the later half of the 1970s, though it was revived somewhat in 1979, peaking at 50,000. In the early 1980s, however, the Soviet leadership decided to block emigration completely. Despite official claims that anti-Semitism was a bourgeois ideology incompatible with socialism, the truth was that Jews who openly practiced their religion or identified as Jewish from a cultural standpoint faced widespread discrimination from the Soviet system.|$|E
5|$|Israel entered six athletes {{into the}} sailing {{competition}} at the Olympics. For the RS:X class, Maayan Davidovich won the bronze medal at the women's event in the 2014 ISAF Sailing World Championships while Nimrod Mashiah finished eleventh place at the Men's event. Both of them secured a place <b>for</b> <b>Israel</b> in the Olympics. In April 2016, Davidovich and Shahar Tzuberi, Beijing 2008 bronze medalist, secured their spots on Israel’s Olympic delegation. Tzuberi defeated Mashiah {{in the battle for}} representing Israel at the Olympics. This was the third time Tzuberi participated at the Olympic Games and the second time for Davidovich. Davidovich finished ninth in the final race, taking 24 minutes and 46 seconds to complete her sail. Her overall ranking was seventh with 78 net points. Before the final race, she was ranked fifth with 60 net points. Tzuberi failed to qualify for the finals and finished seventeenth with 160 net points.|$|E

5|$|Near {{midnight on}} 20 May, Eichmann was sedated by an Israeli doctor on the Mossad team and {{dressed as a}} flight attendant. He was smuggled out of Argentina aboard the same El Al Bristol Britannia {{aircraft}} that had {{a few days earlier}} carried Israel's delegation to the official 150th anniversary celebration of Argentina's independence from Spain. After a tense delay at the airport getting the flight plan approved, the plane took off <b>for</b> <b>Israel,</b> stopping over in Dakar, Senegal, to refuel. They arrived in Israel on 22 May, and Ben-Gurion announced Eichmann's capture to the Knesset—Israel's parliament—the following afternoon. In Argentina, the abduction was met with a violent wave of antisemitism carried out by far-right elements, including the Tacuara Nationalist Movement.|$|E
5|$|On July 15, 1948, with {{fighting}} {{raging in}} Israel and Tel Aviv suffering from Royal Egyptian Air Force (REAF) raids, the three B-17s departed Žatec <b>for</b> <b>Israel.</b> Still ill-equipped, the bombers were nevertheless tasked with bombing Egyptian targets en route. Flying {{south along the}} Adriatic, near Crete the bombers separated with Bill Katz and Ray Kurtz taking the only Fortress with an oxygen system and a proper sight to bomb the royal palace in Cairo, {{and the other two}} B-17s heading towards the REAF base at El-Arish. While Katz and Kurtz successfully bombed the Abdeen Palace, the other two failed to locate their target and bombed Rafah instead, and all landed that evening at Tel Nof. The three aircraft were back in action at 06:30 on the very next day, hitting the REAF base at El-Arish they had missed the previous night. As Tel-Nof was deemed vulnerable to Egyptian attacks, the aircraft then landed at Ramat David, which was to house the squadron {{for the remainder of the}} war. In following days, until a UN-brokered ceasefire came into effect on July 18, the Fortresses struck across three fronts, attacking Majdal, Damascus and Tulkarm. Raising the average bomb load of an IAF sortie from 100kg per sortie to 743kg per sortie, the B-17s are credited with propelling the Israeli Air Force into the realm of modern aerial warfare.|$|E
