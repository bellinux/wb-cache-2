40|$|We have {{measured}} the uranium L 3 absorption and resonant emission spectra in the localized magnetic compound UPd 3 and heavy fermion UPd 2 Al 3 {{as a function}} of pressure. The spectral line shape of the absorption edge is found to vary rapidly <b>in</b> <b>UPd</b> 2 Al 3 with a notable broadening of the white line above the structural transition around 25 GPa while it shows a more gradual variation <b>in</b> <b>UPd</b> 3 over the considered pressure range 0 – 40 GPa, indicating different responses of the f-d electrons to the compressed lattice in the two compounds. The U L 3 absorption spectra <b>in</b> both <b>UPd</b> 3 and UPd 2 Al 3 and their pressure dependence were further simulated via first-principles band calculations within the linear muffin-tin orbital approach. The calculations reproduce the main features of the experimental absorption edges. The calculated pressure dependence of the f charge reveals a stronger localization of the f electrons <b>in</b> <b>UPd</b> 3 which shows a remarkably stable valency under pressure, close the nominal value of 4. On the contrary, our results point to a mixed valent U 4 − ground state <b>in</b> <b>UPd</b> 2 Al 3 at ambient conditions, evolving into a U 4 + or possibly U 4 + configuration at high pressure.

5|$|After {{military}} service, Jarrell {{moved to}} Chicago where his sister Nellie attended Northwestern University. It was in Chicago where Jarrell {{would have his}} first museum experiences. Growing <b>in</b> <b>up</b> Georgia, African Americans {{were not allowed to}} visit museums until the Civil Rights Act of 1964, therefore these early museum visits made a major impression on him. A year later he enrolled at the Art Institute of Chicago for advertising art and graphic design, where he attended night classes. His days were spent working at the International Paint company where he mixed paint. He also took classes at the Ray Vogue School for Commercial Arts. He began attending the Art Institute full-time in 1954. Jarrell eventually lost interest in commercial art and focused on classes about painting and drawing, gaining inspiration from instructor Laura McKinnon and her ideas about spatial relationship theory. In 1958, he graduated with his original major(s), retaining a strong desire to pursue the life of a fine artist. At this time he also met artist Jeff Donaldson, who became a friend who influenced his career. In 1959, the year of his first marriage, he became an advertising photographer, taking photos of type and lettering styles. The couple would divorce shortly after the marriage.|$|E

5|$|Around 06:00UTC, Bopha passed 100km (65mi) {{south of}} Babeldaob island in Palau while at its initial peak. Shortly {{thereafter}} {{it made its}} closest approach the nation, tracking roughly 55km (35mi) south of Angaur island. After clearing Palau, Bopha ultimately intensified further before making a devastating landfall on Mindanao in the Philippines. The JTWC estimated its peak intensity at 280km/h (175mph), a Category5 on the SSHWS. The storm resulted <b>in</b> <b>up</b> to 1,901fatalities {{in the country and}} tremendous infrastructural damage. Land interaction substantially weakened the system by the time it emerged over the Sulu Sea. Turning north, Bopha briefly weakened to a tropical storm on December6 before undergoing another period of rapid intensification. After reaching its tertiary peak on December7, hostile wind shear caused dramatic weakening. In a 24‑hour span, the typhoon's central pressure rose by 55mbar (hPa; 1.62inHg) while its winds fell from 170km/h (105mph) to 75km/h (45mph). Bopha soon degraded to a tropical depression and dissipated off the northwestern coast of Luzon early on December9.|$|E

5|$|Auricularia auricula-judae grows {{upon the}} wood of {{deciduous}} trees and shrubs, favouring elder. <b>In</b> <b>up</b> to 90% of cases, the mushroom is found on elder, but it is often incorrectly assumed to grow exclusively on elder. It has also been recorded on Acer pseudoplatanus (known in the United Kingdom as sycamore), beech, ash, spindle, and in one particular case, the sycamore draining board of an old sink in Hatton Garden. Recently, A. auricula-judae has been recorded from semi-evergreen to evergreen and wet evergreen shola forests in the Western Ghats, India. This species occurs scattered and in clusters on dead or dying branches of trees, on main trunk, decaying logs, etc. This species occurs during the monsoon period in large imbricate clusters and under high humid conditions produces exceptionally large sized basidiomes. A. auricula-judae growing in wet evergreen and shola forests shows remarkable variation in size, shape and colour. In Australia, it is found in Eucalyptus woodland and rainforests; in the rainforests, it can grow in very large colonies on fallen logs. It favours older branches, where it feeds as a saprophyte (on dead wood) or a weak parasite (on living wood), and it causes white rot.|$|E

5|$|Damage to the airways {{can cause}} {{subcutaneous}} emphysema (air {{trapped in the}} subcutaneous tissue of the skin) in the abdomen, chest, neck, and head. Subcutaneous emphysema, present <b>in</b> <b>up</b> to 85% of people with TBI, is particularly indicative of the injury when {{it is only in}} the neck. Air is trapped in the chest cavity outside the lungs (pneumothorax) in about 70% of TBI. Especially strong evidence that TBI has occurred is failure of a pneumothorax to resolve even when a chest tube is placed to rid the chest cavity of the air; it shows that air is continually leaking into the chest cavity from the site of the tear. Air can also be trapped in the mediastinum, the center of the chest cavity (pneumomediastinum). If air escapes from a penetrating injury to the neck, a definite diagnosis of TBI can be made. Hamman's sign, a sound of crackling that occurs in time with the heartbeat, may also accompany TBI.|$|E

In October 2008, Downey signed a new four-picture deal, that retroactively included the first film, to reprise his role and Don Cheadle was hired to replace Terrence Howard as James Rhodes. Jackson signed on to reprise his role as Nick Fury from the Iron Man post-credits sequence <b>in</b> <b>up</b> to nine films, and Scarlett Johansson was cast as the Black Widow, as part of a multi-film commitment. Principal photography began April 6, 2009, at the Pasadena Masonic Temple in Pasadena, California. The majority of filming took place at Raleigh Studios in Manhattan Beach, California. Other locations included Edwards Air Force Base, Monaco, and the Sepulveda Dam. Iron Man 2 premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles, California on April 26, 2010, and was released internationally between April 28 and May 7 before releasing in North America on May 7.|$|E

5|$|In 1943, {{development}} efforts {{were directed to}} a gun-type fission weapon with plutonium called Thin Man. Initial research on the properties of plutonium was done using cyclotron-generated plutonium-239, which was extremely pure, but could only be created in very small amounts. Los Alamos received the first sample of plutonium from the Clinton X-10 reactor in April 1944 and within days Emilio Segrè discovered a problem: the reactor-bred plutonium had a higher concentration of plutonium-240, resulting <b>in</b> <b>up</b> to five times the spontaneous fission rate of cyclotron plutonium.

On other liners, the steerage passengers would have been expected to bring their own food. Rather than dormitory-style sleeping areas, third class passengers had their own cabins. The single men and women were separated, women in the stern in two to six berth cabins, men in the bow <b>in</b> <b>up</b> to ten berth cabins, often shared with strangers. Each stateroom was fitted with wood panelling and beds with mattresses, blankets, pillows, electric lights, heat and a washbasin with running water, except for the bow cabins which did not have a private washbasin.
