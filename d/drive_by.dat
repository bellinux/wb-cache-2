40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{response}} of nonlinear systems <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> parametric Poissonian white noise is examined. As is well known, the response sample function or the response statistics of a system <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> external white noise processes is completely defined. Starting from the system <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> external white noise processes, when an invertible nonlinear transformation is applied, the transformed system in the new state variable is <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> a parametric type excitation. So this latter artificial system {{may be used as}} a tool to find out the proper solution to solve systems <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> parametric white noises. In fact, solving this new system, being the nonlinear transformation invertible, we must pass from the solution of the artificial system (<b>driven</b> <b>by</b> parametric noise) to that of the original one (<b>driven</b> <b>by</b> external noise, that is known). Moreover, introducing this invertible nonlinear transformation into the Itˆo’s rule for the original system <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> external input, one can derive the Itˆo’s rule for systems <b>driven</b> <b>by</b> a parametric type excitation, directly. In this latter case one can see how natural is the presence of the Wong–Zakai correction term or the presence of the hierarchy of correction terms in the case of normal and Poissonian white noise, respectively. Direct transformation on the Fokker–Planck and on the Kolmogorov–Feller equation for the case of parametric input are found...|$|R

5|$|By {{the turn}} of the century, the West Park Commission was riddled with {{political}} graft, and the three parks became dilapidated. As part of a reform effort in 1905, Jens Jensen was appointed as General Superintendent and Chief Landscape Architect for the entire West Park System. Jensen, now recognized as dean of the prairie style of landscape architecture, improved deteriorating sections of the parks and added new features. Among Jensen's improvements were a semi-circular entryway at Marshall Boulevard, and a formal garden at the corner of Ogden Avenue and Sacramento <b>Drive.</b> <b>By</b> the time Jensen designed the garden, Ogden Avenue, a diagonal roadway with a major streetcar thoroughfare that would later become part of Route 66, had already been constructed. The road divided the park into two separate landscapes, creating a busy intersection at the junction of Ogden and Sacramento Avenues. Jensen's solution was a long axial garden on the southeast side of the intersection, providing a buffer between Ogden Avenue and playing fields to the south. Jensen demolished the conservatories in each of the West Park System parks in favor of one grand conservatory at Garfield Park.|$|E
