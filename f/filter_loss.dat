50|$|Crystals grow anisotropically; {{the growth}} along the Z axis {{is up to}} 3 times faster than along the X axis. The growth {{direction}} and rate also influences the rate of uptake of impurities. Y-bar crystals, or Z-plate crystals with long Y axis, have four growth regions usually called +X, −X, Z, and S. The distribution of impurities during growth is uneven; different growth areas contain different levels of contaminants. The Z regions are the purest, the small occasionally present S regions are less pure, the +X region is yet less pure, and the -X region has {{the highest level of}} impurities. The impurities {{have a negative impact on}} radiation hardness, susceptibility to twinning, <b>filter</b> <b>loss,</b> and long and short term stability of the crystals. Different-cut seeds in different orientations may provide other kinds of growth regions. The growth speed of the −X direction is slowest due to the effect of adsorption of water molecules on the crystal surface; aluminium impurities suppress growth in two other directions. The content of aluminium is lowest in Z region, higher in +X, yet higher in −X, and highest in S; the size of S regions also grows with increased amount of aluminium present. The content of hydrogen is lowest in Z region, higher in +X region, yet higher in S region, and highest in −X. Aluminium inclusions transform into color centers with gamma-ray irradiation, causing a darkening of the crystal proportional to the dose and level of impurities; the presence of regions with different darkness reveals the different growth regions.|$|E

Borehole instability and reservoir damage had become the international technical problems of petroleum exploration and development of complicated area, and the water of drilling fluid invading borehole wall and petroleum reservoir was {{the main cause of}} borehole instability and reservoir damage. In order to prevent the water of drilling fluid invading borehole wall and petroleum reservoir, domestic and foreign scholars recently put forward the technology of ultra-low permeable drilling fluid.

Stringed musical instruments produce decaying sounds due to physical losses, which need to be modeled.

30|$|There is no deep {{understanding}} of the application of nanoparticles in water-based muds (WBM). Therefore, such study that helps to enhance the knowledge {{in the field of}} well stability using modern methods in an unforgiving industry is very much needed. The nanoparticles accumulate on the wellbore wall and due to their very small sizes, they seal the pores in the mud cake, which plasters the wellbore. This paper focuses on empirical aspects of using nano-bentonite for <b>filter</b> <b>loss</b> control. The current work was applied on a nano-drilling fluid to improve filtration characteristics of drilling fluid in the wellbore. Therefore, nano-bentonite WBM (size between 90 and 100  nm) was introduced as the smart drilling fluid with abilities to overcome the tight spot problem in wellbores, which has been investigated in the paper. Three different drilling fluids were prepared using nano-bentonite clay with the main focus of enhancing those rheological features of the fluid expected to improve the mud characteristics, especially the plastering properties. Low pressure low temperature (LPLT) filter press test has been utilized to calculate the <b>filter</b> <b>loss</b> volume and the viscosity, yield point and gel strength of the understudy samples and the results have been compared.

40|$|Abstract—For {{the first}} time, the {{new class of}} filter {{transfer}} functions, called chained-function filters, is described in theoret-ical detail. The chained-function concept can give a variety of transfer functions, having the same order, but different frequency domain, time domain, and implementation characteristics. As a result, a filter can be selected to have the required reduction in sensitivity to manufacturing errors, resonator unloaded-, and filter losses. This can be achieved while maintaining a given return-loss level and a predetermined out-of-band rejection per-formance that is comparable with conventional Chebyshev filters. The transfer-function formulations are given in detail, {{as well as the}} analysis of frequency- and time-domain responses, resonator unloaded- requirements, and <b>filter</b> <b>loss</b> responses.

Filtering, the most important process in water treatment plant, acts as a physical barrier to pathogenic organisms, including resistant microorganisms. The assessment was carried out on the current problem of <b>filter</b> media <b>loss</b> and the repeated occurrence of particle breakthrough followed by turbidity value > 0. 2 NTU. The filter run often terminated due to particle breakthrough which arises usually during an increase in hydraulic loading rate. The assessment was performed from January 2010 to June 2010 and started from the confirmation of <b>filter</b> media <b>loss,</b> searching the cause {{and the extent of}} the loss.

40|$|Abstract—Identities {{yielding}} optimal estimation interpretations {{for mutual}} information and relative entropy- paralleling those known for minimum mean squared estimation under additive Gaussian noise- were recently discovered for the Poisson channel by Atar and Weissman. We express these identities as equalities between {{expectations of the}} associated estimation and informa-tion theoretic random variables such as the actual estimation loss and the information density. By explicitly characterizing the relations between these random variables we {{show that they are}} related in much stronger pointwise senses that directly imply the known expectation identities while deepening our understanding of them. As an example for the nature of our results, consider the equality between the mutual information and the mean cumulative <b>filtering</b> <b>loss</b> of the optimal filter in continuous-time estimation. We show that the difference between the informa-tion density and the cumulative <b>filtering</b> <b>loss</b> is a martingale expressible as a stochastic integral. This explicit characterization not only directly recovers the previously known expectation relation, but allows to characterize other distributional properties of the random variables involved where some of the original objects of interest emerge in new and surprising roles. For example, we find that the increasing predictable part of the Doob-Meyer decomposition of the information density (which is a sub-martinagle) is nothing but the cumulative loss of the optimal filter.

30|$|The optimal anticoagulation regimen during MARS {{has also}} been discussed. This is an {{important}} issue considering the difficult haemostasis balance in patients suffering from hepatic failure, who are at high risk of haemorrhagic and thrombotic phenomena. The best-known and most used method is unfractionated heparin, but there are some concerns regarding haemorrhagic risk and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Some studies have explored the use of continuous extracorporeal systems without anticoagulation and have found a comparable circuit lifespan [23]. In this sense, the anticoagulant-free approach may be a valid option in patients at high risk of bleeding. Local anticoagulation with citrate may also become a good option if close metabolic monitoring is exercised, and some studies have shown that it is safe and that it guarantees a longer treatment time, preventing <b>filter</b> <b>loss</b> [24, 25]. However, its widespread use cannot be recommended at this stage. In most clinical trials, unfractionated heparin was the anticoagulant of choice, but some studies have used local citrate anticoagulation, especially trials with FPSA [26, 27], with no reported adverse effects. The use of prostacyclin can be found anecdotally in the literature.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis {{is a continuation}} of the design and development of a three-dimensional 2. 4 GHz digital phased array radar antenna. A commercial off-the-shelf quadrature modulator and demodulator were used as phase shifters in the digital transmit and receive arrays. The phase response characteristic of the demodulator was measured and the results show that the phase difference between the received phase and transmit phase is small. In order to increase the bandwidth of the phased array, a method of time-varying phase weights for linear frequency modulated signal was investigated. Using time-varying phase weights on transmit and receive give the best performance, but require the range information of the target. It is more practical to use time-varying phase weights on only one side (transmit or receive but not both), and constant phase weights on the other side. The simulation results showed that by using time-varying phase weights, the matched <b>filter</b> <b>loss</b> is not as severe as it is when using the conventional fixed weights technique.
