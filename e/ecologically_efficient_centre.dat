40|$|This study {{examines}} how consumers select <b>ecologically</b> <b>efficient</b> water heaters in Japan. Energy conservation in household water heating is increasingly important for reducing {{an amount of}} CO 2 emission, because the share of water heating in household energy consumption is approximately 30 %. Recently, Japanese households have widely used <b>ecologically</b> <b>efficient</b> electric heat pump water heaters (Eco Cute) or gas-fired water heaters (Eco Jozu). The total number of such efficient water heaters sold in Japan was more than 2. 5  million {{at the end of}} 2008. This study investigates various factors and impacts of marketing strategy for promoting the appliances in Japan. We apply mixed and nested logit models to a disaggregated choice data on water heaters from 2004 to 2008. This study considers retail energy prices, a government financial support and marketing activities as important factors for appliance selection. In addition, we consider consumers' housing attributes such as floor space and age of building. This empirical study finds two business implications. One of the two implications is that an increase in an energy price may enhance a choice probability of Eco Cute and Eco Jozu because a price increase invites consumer's consciousness on energy conservation so that a cost reduction on energy consumption becomes essential in a use of the efficient appliances. The other implication is that marketing activities, especially by recommendations from sales representatives and/or housing suppliers, are important for consumer behaviors. The other important findings are discussed in this study. This business experience in Japan is useful to the other countries where <b>ecologically</b> <b>efficient</b> water heaters are not popular at the current moment. <b>Ecologically</b> <b>efficient</b> water heater Heat pump Marketing Logit model...|$|R

Where does language fit into this emerging picture of the embodied, <b>ecologically</b> <b>efficient</b> agent? One useful way to approach this question is to consider language itself as a cognition-enhancing animal-built structure. To take this perspective is to view language as a kind of self-constructed cognitive niche: a persisting though never stationary material scaffolding whose critical role in promoting thought and reason remains surprisingly ill-understood. It is the very materiality of this linguistic scaffolding, I suggest, that is responsible for some key benefits.

The present commons dilemma study seeks to extend these findings with two inherently relevant concepts: First, the ecological efficiency of the group norm, and second, the physical distance between the actors involved. Physical distance was manipulated by administering a web-based commons dilemma task to participants in the laboratory versus participants in the Internet. Ecological efficiency was manipulated by giving participants feedback about an overusing or a conserving group norm while the pool was either big or small. Conformity effects were strongest when the perceived group norm was <b>ecologically</b> <b>efficient</b> and participants were physically closer. Moreover, the effect of physical distance was mediated by the importance a person attached to the group’s behavior.

40|$|Thus far, {{there has}} been a {{reluctance}} to instigate a dialogue and engage with the tensions between two literatures with significant insights for each other. The first is the literature on the fiscal sustainability of welfare states, which is invariably predicated upon future growth primarily to manage demographic changes. The second is the post-growth literature, which has enjoyed a renaissance in recent years due to an environmental critique of economic growth. Both literatures contain implications for the analysis of welfare state sustainability. The primary contribution of this paper will be to explore the intractability of the tensions between these discourses and the difficulty of mapping out a progressive policy direction in the twenty-first century which meets both our environmental and social sensibilities. It is claimed that in the post-industrial world the fiscal sustainability of welfare capitalism is dependent upon public expenditure financed indirectly an environmentally unsustainable growth dynamic, but that ironically any conflagration of public welfare programmes is likely to be counter-productive as the welfare state is able to promote de-carbonisation strategies and notions of the public good as well as promoting monetarily and <b>ecologically</b> <b>efficient</b> public welfare services...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} project focused on developing a general energetic balance model that evaluates an industrial fishery. It was constructed by incorporating methodologies developed by Tyedmers (2000) and other energetic principles to give both a energetic {{return for a}} fishery and an evaluation of ecological efficiency for that fishery. The energetic measurement is a comparison of all energy inputs that are derived from net primary production (NPP), whether recent or ancient {{in the form of}} fossil fuels, and the energy received in the form of food from the fishery. The ecological efficiency in this study uses the metric of an Ecological Footprint (EF). This model was used then to compare the different fishery vessel length classes of the cod fishery for the period of 1982 - 1986 found in what is defined by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization as 3 K and 3 L. This region lies mainly off of the coast of Newfoundland, Canada. [...] The model {{can be used as a}} comparative tool to compare different fisheries or different fishery methods for ecological efficiency. The utility of knowing which fishery method is more <b>ecologically</b> <b>efficient</b> could allow those in managerial roles within the fishery to select those fisheries with optimal return and reduced ecological impact. This would be beneficial as fisheries are often an important food resource. [...] The case study results indicated that the energetically and <b>ecologically</b> most <b>efficient</b> cod fisheries by vessel class ranked in the following order: twenty-five to thirty four feet, thirty-five to forty-four feet, forty-five to sixty-four feet and finally less than twenty-five feet class. The trend observed in three of the four vessel classes saw the efficiencies diminishing with time, probably reflecting a decreasing cod stock. Industrial fisheries methods have effectively increased human reliance on ancient NPP to perform these fisheries. In the past energy from wind and currents was used. The energy is now derived from the combustion of fossil fuels, ancient NPP...|$|R

In major cities the most intensive creation and accumulation of SMW is happening in the sources of their creation (residential and public buildings of various public services and amenities and purpose, enterprises, cities, yard territories), which in case of unduly disposal and deactivation could substantially pollute the environment (E). With the purpose of improvement of the activity on handling of SMW and improvement of ecological state of urban territories public utility services enterprises are functioning.

An intrusion of Brazil Current Tropical Water (22 ºC; 36. 5) separates warm, less-saline water (22 ºC; 35. 2) from cooler, more-saline water (15 ºC; 36. 4). Prevailing northeasterly winds led to upwelling of South Atlantic Central Water over the shelf, promoting high Chl a concentrations. Three species constituted 99 % of the 628 cephalopods collected: Illex argentinus (n = 540; 4 – 40 mm mantle length, ML), Argonauta nodosa (n = 46; 2 – 19 mm ML), and Loligo sanpaulensis (n = 42, 2 – 21 mm ML).
