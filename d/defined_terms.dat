25|$|Āstika and nāstika are {{variously}} <b>defined</b> <b>terms</b> {{sometimes used}} to categorise Indian religions. The traditional definition, followed by Adi Shankara, classifies religions and persons as āstika and nāstika {{according to whether}} they accept {{the authority of the}} main Hindu texts, the Vedas, as supreme revealed scriptures, or not. By this definition, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Samkhya, Yoga, Purva Mimamsa and Vedanta are classified as āstika schools, while Charvaka is classified as a nāstika school. Buddhism and Jainism are also thus classified as nāstika religions since they do not accept the authority of the Vedas.|$|E
500|$|The {{bill passed}} the Senate by an {{overwhelming}} 52–1 vote {{and passed the}} House without dissent. President Harrison signed the bill into law on July 2, 1890. Sherman was the prime mover in getting the bill passed and became [...] "by far the most articulate spokesman for antitrust in Congress". The Act was later criticized for its simple language and lack of <b>defined</b> <b>terms,</b> but Sherman defended it, saying that it drew on common-law language and precedents. He also denied that the Act was anti-business at all, saying that it only opposed unfair business practices. Sherman emphasized that the Act aimed not at lawful competition, but at illegal combination. The later analysis was more generous: [...] "The Sherman Act was as good an antitrust law as the Congress of 1890 could have devised." ...|$|E

500|$|Investigators {{asserted}} that the performances by the traffic controllers were proper and that the misunderstandings that were made were reasonable. None of the controllers involved considered the word [...] "priority" [...] or the assertions by the flight crew that they were running out of fuel to be indicative of an emergency. The report provided various examples of the flight crew failing to convey the danger of their situation, even moments before the engines flamed out. Although the investigators felt that the communications from the ATC personnel were [...] "proper," [...] the NTSB voiced concern over the controllers not placing significance on the word [...] "priority." [...] At a public hearing, it was revealed by an unrelated pilot that {{the emphasis on the}} word [...] "priority" [...] by the Avianca crew might have come from training and bulletins from Boeing that used the word in relation to fuel emergencies. [...] Avianca also used the word [...] "priority" [...] in its publications on low-fuel status procedures. ATC controllers testified that [...] "Mayday", [...] "pan-pan", and [...] "emergency" [...] were the three phrases that they would respond to immediately. [...] The report also stated that [...] "priority" [...] was defined in the ATC Handbook as [...] "precedence, established by order of urgency or importance." [...] As a result of this linguistic confusion, the NTSB recommended that the FAA work with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to develop a standard glossary of clearly <b>defined</b> <b>terms</b> as well as notify foreign carriers that they must be knowledgeable of ATC rules and procedures.|$|E

2500|$|A law is unconstitutionally vague if it {{does not}} have clarity enough to create [...] "legal debate".

Although the wording was undeniably open-ended and uncertain, the concept of undue interference with competition was deemed sufficient to enable legal debate on the subject.|$|E
2500|$|Operational {{definitions}} are {{at their}} most controversial {{in the fields of}} psychology and psychiatry, where intuitive concepts, such as intelligence need to be operationally defined before they become amenable to scientific investigation, for example, through processes such as IQ tests. Such definitions are used as a follow up to a theoretical definition, in which the specific concept is defined as a measurable occurrence. John Stuart Mill pointed out the dangers of believing that anything that could be given a name must refer to a thing and Stephen Jay Gould and others have criticized psychologists for doing just that [...] A committed operationalist would respond that speculation about the thing in itself, or noumenon, should be resisted as meaningless, and would comment only on phenomena using operationally <b>defined</b> <b>terms</b> and tables of operationally defined measurements [...]|$|E
