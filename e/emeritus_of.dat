5|$|A {{new site}} for the cathedral was {{selected}} above Caine Road by the Glenealy Ravine and {{the cornerstone of the}} new church was laid on 8 December 1883.

The ceremony was officiated by the Vicar Apostolic of Hong Kong Enrico Valtorta, the Bishop of Macau José da Costa Nunes and the Bishop <b>Emeritus</b> <b>of</b> Canton; three of the cathedral's altars were also consecrated.|$|E
