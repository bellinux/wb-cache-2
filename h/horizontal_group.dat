One of {{the most}} {{singular}} proofs of the vanity of all hope that conditions of art may be combined with the occupations of such a city, has been given lately {{in the design of}} the new iron bridge over the Thames at Blackfriars. Distinct attempt has been there made to obtain architectural effect on a grand scale. Nor was there anything in the nature of the work to prevent such an effort being successful. It is not edifices, being of iron, or of glass, or thrown into new forms, demanded by new purposes, which need hinder its being beautiful. But it is the absence of all desire of beauty, of all joy in fancy, and of all freedom in thought. If a Greek, or Egyptian, or Gothic architect had been required to design such a bridge, he would have looked instantly at the main conditions of its structure, and dwelt on them with the delight of imagination. He would have seen that the main thing to be done was to hold a <b>horizontal</b> <b>group</b> of iron rods steadily and straight over stone piers. Then he would have said to himself (or felt without saying), [...] "It is this holding,--this grasp,--this securing tenor of a thing which might be shaken, so that it cannot be shaken, on which I have to insist." [...] And he would have put some life into those iron tenons. As a Greek put human life into his pillars and produced the caryatid; and an Egyptian lotus life into his pillars and produced the lily capital: so here, either of them would have put some gigantic or some angelic life into those colossal sockets. He would perhaps have put vast winged statues of bronze, folding their wings, and grasping the iron rails with their hands; or monstrous eagles, or serpents holding with claw or coil, or strong four-footed animals couchant, holding with the paw, or in fierce action, holding with teeth. Thousands of grotesque or of lovely thoughts would have risen before him, and the bronze forms, animal or human, would have signified, either in symbol or in legend, whatever might be gracefully told respecting the purposes of the work and the districts to which it conducted. Whereas, now, the entire invention of the designer seems to have exhausted itself in exaggerating to an enormous size a weak form of iron nut, and in conveying the information upon it, in large letters, that it belongs to the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway Company. I believe then, gentlemen, that if there were any life in the national mind in such respects, it would be shown in these its most energetic and costly works. But that there is no such life, nothing but a galvanic restlessness and covetousness, with which it is for the present vain to strive; and in the midst of which, tormented at once by its activities and its apathies, having their work continually thrust aside and dishonored, always seen to disadvantage, and overtopped by huge masses, discordant and destructive, even the best architects must be unable to do justice to their own powers.|$|E

The data of waves with downward phase velocity and the data of waves with upward phase velocity were independently treated. First, the vertical phase velocity and vertical group velocity {{as well as the}} characteristic wave period for each wave packet were obtained by phase and group velocity tracing technique. Then its horizontal wavelength, intrinsic wave period and <b>horizontal</b> <b>group</b> velocity were obtained by the dispersion relation. The intrinsic frequency and azimuth of wave vector of each wave packet were checked by Stokes parameters analysis. The results showed that the waves with intrinsic periods in the range 30 min– 4. 5 h had horizontal wavelength ranging from 25 to 240 km, vertical wavelength from 2. 5 to 12 km, and <b>horizontal</b> <b>group</b> velocities from 15 to 60 m s − 1. Both upward moving wave packets and downward moving wave packets had <b>horizontal</b> <b>group</b> velocities mostly directed in the sector between directions NNE (north-north-east) and SEE in the month of November, and mostly in the sector between directions NW and SWS in the month of July. Comparing with mean wind directions, the gravity waves appeared to be more likely to propagate along with mean wind than against it. This apparent prevalence for downstream wave packets was found to be caused by a systematic filtering effect existing in the process of phase and group velocity tracing analysis: A significant portion of upstream wave packets might have been Doppler shifted out of the vertical range in phase and group velocity tracing analysis...|$|E

The data were divided by double Fourier transformation into a data set of upward moving waves and a data set of downward moving waves for independent analysis. The phase and group velocity tracing technique was applied to measure the vertical group and phase velocity {{as well as the}} characteristic period of the gravity wave packet. Then the dispersion equation of the linear theory of AGW was solved to obtain its intrinsic wave period – horizontal wavelength and <b>horizontal</b> <b>group</b> velocity – and the vertical flux of horizontal momentum associated with each wave packet was estimated to help determine the direction of the characteristic horizontal wave vector. The results showed that the waves with periods in the range of 30 min 6 h had horizontal scales ranging from 20 km to 1500 km, vertical scales from 4 km to 15 km, and horizontal phase velocities from 15 m/s to 60 m/s.

40|$|We discuss {{various aspects}} of the early petite {{unification}} (PUT) of quarks and leptons based on the gauge group G_PUT=SU(4) _PS x SU(2) _L x SU(2) _R x SU(2) _H. This unification takes place at the scale M= O(1 - 2 TeV) and gives the correct value of sin^ 2 theta_W(M_Z^ 2) without the violation of the upper bound on the K_L -> mu e rate and the limits on FCNC processes. These properties require the existence of three new generations of unconventional quarks and leptons with charges up to 4 / 3 (for quarks) and 2 (for leptons) and masses O(250 GeV) in addition to the standard three generations of quarks and leptons.

The mixing matrix is {{expressed in terms of}} one parameter, which is determined either by discussing that it is identical to that of the quark mixing matrix or by assuming that the observed solar neutrino flux results from neutrino oscillations. The problem of generations of quarks and leptons may be viewed as indicative of a new symmetry group (the <b>horizontal</b> <b>group),</b> or of a composite model [1]. Despite some difficulties in the models, which are characteristic for an infant stage of research, in particular the question of the mass spectrum, both directions have been pursued vigorously in the last few years. In a composite model of quarks and leptons, the generations are considered to be radial excited states with zero angular momentum. Assuming that it is a bound-state problem of two-body systems, several authors [2 - 4] propos-ed a method to calculate the mixing matrix (thereafter called the U-matrix).
