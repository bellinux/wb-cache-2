5|$|Colonies {{are usually}} {{situated}} on islands, cliffs or headlands, which land mammals have difficulty accessing. This {{is thought to}} provide protection to seabirds, which are often very clumsy on land. Coloniality often arises in types of bird that do not defend feeding territories (such as swifts, which have a very variable prey source); {{this may be a}} reason why it arises more frequently in seabirds. There are other possible advantages: colonies may act as information centres, where seabirds returning to the sea to forage can <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>where</b> prey is by studying returning individuals of the same species. There are disadvantages to colonial life, particularly the spread of disease. Colonies also attract the attention of predators, principally other birds, and many species attend their colonies nocturnally to avoid predation.|$|E
5|$|The {{full extent}} of {{casualties}} on that first day are not known. Birdwood, who did not come ashore {{until late in the}} day, estimated between three and four hundred dead on the beaches. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage claims one in five of the three thousand New Zealanders involved became a casualty. The Australian War Memorial has 860 Australian dead between 25–30 April, and the Australian Government estimates 2,000 wounded left Anzac Cove on 25 April, but more wounded were still waiting on the battlefields to be evacuated. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission documents that 754 Australian and 147 New Zealand soldiers died on 25 April 1915. A higher than normal proportion of the ANZAC casualties were from the officer ranks. One theory was that they kept exposing themselves to fire, trying to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>where</b> they were or to locate their troops. Four men were taken prisoner by the Turks.|$|E

25|$|Almost {{immediately}} after taking off at 11:47AM, Boyle became disoriented and started flying South when {{he followed the}} wrong set of railroad tracks out of the city.

Unfortunately, however, he broke the prop on his airplane when he made a hard landing, so the 140 pounds of mail he was carrying had to be trucked back to Washington.|$|E
25|$|After being separated, Miles tells Torque to {{meet him}} at the harbor, where they will {{interrogate}} Jordan and <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>where</b> Blackmore is. Torque returns to the warehouse, and encounters an imprisoned Consuela Alverez (Meg Savlov), wife of Ernesto, a CO from Carnate Island.

25|$|Besides the singing, the koledari also chased away demons {{from the}} household. First they searched {{the house to}} <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>where</b> the demons hide. They looked everywhere, {{at the same time}} shouting, dancing, jumping, {{knocking}} on the floor and walls with sticks, and teasing Bride. When they found the demons, they drove them out of the hiding place, and fought with them swinging their sabers and clubs. After the demons were chased away, the koledari briefly danced the kolo, and then blessed the household. As a reward, they received a loaf of bread which the family prepared specially for them, and other food gifts.|$|E
25|$|Meat {{often comes}} from hunting. Conservation groups are {{concerned}} that, {{with the rise}} in the human population, many animal species are in danger of extinction because of the trade in bushmeat. Chimpanzee, bonobo, wild boar, monkey, antelope, and other wild animals are often sold in the market or at impromptu stalls around the town. In 1998, Jeff Dupain and others catalogued the types of bushmeat available in the two main Basankusu markets; they interviewed the stallholders to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>where</b> the animals were hunted. Many people keep livestock around the family home. Chickens, pigs, and, less frequently, sheep and goats provide fresh food and a source of income.|$|E
25|$|Since surfing {{was central}} to the first movie, the filmmakers wanted to include it again, but at a higher level. Core and his team looked {{all over the world}} to try to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>where</b> waves were going to hit, and when, before finally {{settling}} on Teahupo'o in Tahiti. However, shooting the scene proved to be challenging since enormous, surfable waves are rare and unpredictable. A set of crew first went to Jaws, a surf break in Maui, months before principal photography began on the film. The team had to wait several days in Teahupo'o for the waves to swell. Luckily, enormous swells arrived. The crew ran nine cameras in the water, on cliffs and on helicopters to capture the action in January 2014. Laird Hamilton, a pioneering big-wave surfer, who also played a minor role in the film, contributed his skills to the shoot. Additionally, Ian Walsh, a surfer from Maui, Billy Kemper, Makua Rothman, and Ahani Tsondru, served as stunt doubles.|$|E

25|$|Earlier in the story, Piro {{had seen}} Nanasawa Kimiko at an Anna Miller's restaurant, {{where she is}} a waitress, after Tsubasa brought him and Largo there. Later on, Piro {{encounters}} Kimiko outside a train station, where she is worrying aloud that she will miss an audition because she has forgotten her money and railcard. Piro hands her his own railcard and walks off before she can refuse his offer. This event causes Kimiko to develop an idealized vision of her benefactor, an image which is shattered {{the next time they}} meet. Despite this, she gradually develops feelings for Piro, though she is too shy to admit them. Later on in the story, Kimiko's outburst on a radio talk show causes her to suddenly rise to idol status. Angered by the hosts' derisive comments about fanboys, she comes to the defense of her audience, immediately and unintentionally securing their obsessive adoration. Later, her new horde of fanboys <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>where</b> she works and flock to the restaurant, obsessively trying to get pictures up her skirt. Piro works undercover as a busboy {{to get rid of all}} cameras. The scene eventually builds to a climax, in which Kimiko shouts at the fanboys and lifts her skirt in defiance, and they take photographs. Piro, provoked by her outburst into actively defending her, threatens the fanboy crowd, and collects all of their memory cards with the photos. On the way back from the restaurant, Kimiko is suffering from the aftermath of the scene and lashes out at Piro on the subway, which causes him to walk off.|$|E
