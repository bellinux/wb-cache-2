They had this dark past and this intense hatred of witches. So as I thought about it, it made sense to me that of course they would be fated to become great witch hunters. We wanted it to feel like this could be happening 300 years ago but at the same time, there is a modern spin on all the action, characters and weaponry. It was a fun way to make a classical world feel fresh." [...] Wirkola said that he originally came with that idea in 2007 while studying film and television at Bond University in Australia, when he wanted to make it as just a short film, and that the film school director Simon Hunter advised him: [...] "Tom, don't ever speak of the idea again until you are in front of a Hollywood producer and I guarantee you will sell it." ...|$|E

The first release with a movie quote was [...] "Immortal", where Cudi sampled Adam Sandler in his 1995 film Billy Madison: [...] "That’s {{one of my}} favorite movies, man. <b>From</b> <b>my</b> <b>childhood,</b> straight up. I love Adam Sandler. Throughout the album I wanted to include clips from some of my favorite movies to kind of narrate the album a bit and liven it up and give it some personality." [...] He declared that throughout the album, people will hear scenes from several different movies: [...] "Yeah, different actors will pop up periodically. That’s how I felt when I finished the song. 'Oh my God. It's so good!' [...] So {{there had to be a}} way that I could express myself. So I had to find some of my favorite quotes from my favorite movies. I put on Billy Madison and just watched that. There were so many lines that I picked that were great. But “I’m the smartest man alive!” resonated with me. And Adam Sandler is like a god to me. He’s so amazing. I just wanted to pay homage through song and let him know, like, 'You’re the shit!'" ...|$|E

Possibly my inchoate thought was: Better to reign among booze-fighters a prince than to toil twelve hours a day at a machine for ten cents an hour. There are no purple passages in machine toil.

2500|$|Oberman {{described}} {{her work as}} [...] "A kind of Three Sisters via Woody Allen", reflecting the humour she saw in Chekhov's story. She expanded upon this personal connection in an article for The Guardian: [...] "Chekhov wrote about a world I recognised <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>childhood</b> – where intense pain is covered by bravura and humour, and where intense longing is masked by self-deprecation and wit. There was the same obsession with death, the same fierce familial loyalty, the same tendency toward melodrama – {{as well as a}} great passion for food." [...] After returning from Moscow, Oberman continued to work on her reinterpretation for the next 15 years, but lacked the confidence to take her project further. However, after her success in EastEnders she was offered [...] "a lot of work" [...] and was [...] "in a position where I could green-light stuff for myself", determining that [...] "this was the moment when I was going to make this dream happen".|$|E

[...] On his upbringing in Middlesbrough, Clough claimed that it was not the most well-appointed place in the world, [...] "But to me it was heaven". [...] "Everything I have done, everything I've achieved, everything that I can think of that has directed and affected my life – apart from the drink – stemmed <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>childhood.</b> Maybe it was the constant sight of Mam, with eight children to look after, working from morning until night, working harder than you or I have ever worked." ...|$|E

40|$|This study uses autobiographical {{reflection}} {{to investigate}} {{the negative impact of}} essentialist masculine gender socialization on men's lives. In particular, I use personal recollective accounts both <b>from</b> <b>my</b> early <b>childhood</b> socialization—in the traditional Greek-Cypriot culture of the 1970 s and 80 s—and <b>from</b> <b>my</b> own introspections and analytical conceptualizations concerning intimate relationships in general. I analyze these accounts by using a feminist postmodern ideology of gender deconstruction and reconstruction. Men oftentimes fall victims of patriarchal masculine scripting by suppressing their needs for intimacy, connectedness, and self-disclosure, qualities traditionally devalued as feminine traits. Suppressing such needs exacerbates inadequacies in male intimacy with possible manifestations in the form of generalized non-clinical male sexual anxiety. Implications are also discussed in terms of the by-products of male sexual anxiety, such as non-clinical sexual addiction and male victimization...|$|R

This method is essential in helping to answer the research question; {{engaging in}} art production using personal visual and material culture artifacts (children's pictorial encyclopedias) helps me connect with these objects in a way different <b>from</b> <b>my</b> initial <b>childhood</b> interactions and <b>from</b> <b>my</b> adult viewing and allows me to recognize recurring themes, which are utilized in the analytic process...|$|R
