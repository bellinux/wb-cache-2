5|$|Other {{important}} contributions are the Jain basadis' whose towers have gradually receding stories (talas) ornamented with small models of temples. These tiny shrines have in them engravings of tirthankars (Jain saints). Semicircular windows connect the shrines and decorative Kirtimukha (demon faces) are {{used at the}} top. The Chavundaraya basadi built in the 10th or 11th century, Chandragupta basadi built in the 6th century and the monolithic of Gomateshwara of 982 {{are the most important}} monuments at Shravanabelagola. Some features were added to the Chandragupta basadi by famous Hoysala sculptor Dasoja in the 12th century. The decorative doorjambs and perforated screen windows which depict scenes from the life of King Chandragupta Maurya are known to be his creation. The Panchakuta Basadi at Kambadahalli (five towered Jan temple) of about 900 with a Brahmadeva pillar <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>example</b> of Dravidian art. The wall niches here are surmounted by torana (lintel) with carvings of floral motifs, flying divine creatures (gandharva) and imaginary monsters (makara) ridden by Yaksas (attendants of saints) while the niches are occupied by images of tirthankars themselves.|$|E

50|$|Jason Wellwood of Canadian webzine Hellbound.ca {{praised the}} recording's high sound {{quality and the}} band's no-nonsense performance. He {{suggested}} that it <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>example</b> of the band's intense live performances.|$|R
50|$|Invasive species <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>example</b> of {{successful}} ecological release because {{low levels of}} biodiversity, an abundance of resources, and particular life history traits allow their numbers to increase dramatically. Additionally, there are few predators for these species.|$|R
50|$|The EMMA-project {{received}} in October 2008 the EMS (European Meteorological Society) Outreach & Communication Award for the website www.meteoalarm.eu. The panel {{thought that this}} project <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>example</b> of putting <b>a</b> bridge between weather services, science and society.|$|R
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>example</b> of {{automatic}} cueing of one sensor by another. Depending on the application, the sensitive but less selective sensor is either acoustic or non-imaging electro-optical. The selective sensor is forward looking infrared (FLIR).|$|E
25|$|The Tubbataha Reef Marine Park covers 332km2, {{including}} the North and South Reefs. It {{is a unique}} example of an atoll reef with a very high density of marine species; the North Islet serving as a nesting site for birds and marine turtles. The site <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>example</b> of a pristine coral reef with a spectacular 100 m perpendicular wall, extensive lagoons and two coral islands.|$|E
25|$|Currently, Mono Lake is in a geologically {{active area}} {{at the north end}} of the Mono–Inyo Craters {{volcanic}} chain and is close to Long Valley Caldera. Volcanic activity continues in the Mono Lake vicinity: the most recent eruption occurred 350 years ago, resulting in the formation of Paoha Island. Panum Crater (on the south shore of the lake) <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>example</b> of a combined rhyolite dome and cinder cone.|$|E
50|$|Secondary red beds {{formed in}} this way <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>example</b> of telodiagenesis. They {{are linked to the}} uplift, erosion and surface {{weathering}} of previously deposited sediments and require conditions similar to primary and diagenetic red beds for their formation.|$|R
50|$|Silliman Memorial Presbyterian Church, Ontario and Mohawk streets. Facing {{city hall}} {{and built the}} same year, this Romanesque Revival {{sandstone}} structure <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>example</b> of the style. It was listed on the National Register in 1971 but was demolished in 1998.|$|R
50|$|In {{the center}} of the village there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> wooden (originally Greek-Catholic) church of the Transfiguration of Our Lord dating to 1742 which now serves as the Roman Catholic Church. It was renovated in 1877 and 1924. It <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>examples</b> of Boyko architecture.|$|R
25|$|The castle <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>example</b> {{of social}} control {{manifested}} in architectural space. Low-ranking visitors were received in the outer regions of the Ninomaru, whereas high-ranking visitors were shown the more subtle inner chambers. Rather than attempt to conceal the entrances to the rooms for bodyguards (as was done in many castles), the Tokugawas chose to display them prominently. Thus, the construction lent itself to expressing intimidation and power to Edo-period visitors.|$|E
25|$|If {{the long}} poem is {{considered}} an epic or invokes an epic in its length as many critics and readers aver then breaching its traditional exclusivity by using the epic {{to tell the story}} of marginalized peoples such as women rather than the victors is essentially an opportunity for the poet to rewrite history. Walcott’s Omeros <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>example</b> of a long poem recording the untold history of a marginalized people.|$|E
25|$|The castle was {{originally}} {{built in the}} 11th century as a projection of the Norman power in Northern England, as the population of England in the north remained rebellious following the disruption of the Norman Conquest in 1066. It <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>example</b> of the early motte and bailey castles favoured by the Normans. The holder {{of the office of}} Bishop of Durham was appointed by the King to exercise royal authority on his behalf and the castle was the centre of his command.|$|E
50|$|Social insect colonies <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>example</b> of <b>a</b> {{decentralized}} system, {{because no}} individual {{is in charge}} of directing or making decisions for the colony. Several groups of social insects have been shown to use quorum sensing in a process that resembles collective decision-making.|$|R
50|$|The {{church of}} Saint Léon {{was built in}} the 15th century of Bécherel granite. It <b>was</b> {{classified}} as <b>a</b> historic monument in 1926. Although they are damaged, the stained-glass windows <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>example</b> of 16th-century art. Two of the panels can be attributed to Guyon Collin.|$|R
5000|$|Architectural historians {{consider}} {{the house to}} <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>example</b> of early 20th centurydomestic Tudor Revival architecture and among {{the best examples of}} the style in the Black Belt region of Alabama. [...] It was added to National Register of Historic Places on August 27, 1987.|$|R
25|$|In 1912 the Basilica del Santisimo Sacramento {{was opened}} to the public. Totally built by the generous {{donation}} of Mrs. Mercedes Castellanos de Anchorena, Argentina's most prominent family, the church <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>example</b> of French neo-classicism. With extremely high-grade decorations in its interior, the magnificent Mutin-Cavaillé coll organ (the biggest ever installed in an Argentine church with more than four-thousand tubes and four manuals) presided the nave. The altar is full of marble, and was the biggest ever built in South America at that time.|$|E
25|$|The Old City {{is home to}} Switzerland's tallest cathedral as well {{as other}} churches, bridges and a large {{collection}} of Renaissance fountains. In addition to many historical buildings, the seats of the federal, cantonal and municipal government are also situated in the Old City. It is a UNESCO Cultural World Heritage Site since 1983 due to the compact and generally intact medieval core and <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>example</b> of incorporating the modern world into a medieval city. Numerous buildings in the Old City have been designated as Swiss Cultural Properties of National Significance, as well as the entire Old City.|$|E
25|$|The {{religious}} {{architecture of}} Christian {{churches in the}} Middle Ages featured the Latin cross plan, which takes the Roman Basilica as its primary model with subsequent developments. It consists of a nave, transepts, and the altar stands at the east end (see Cathedral diagram). Also, cathedrals influenced or commissioned by Justinian employed the Byzantine style of domes and a Greek cross (resembling a plus sign), centering attention on the altar {{at the center of}} the church. The Church of the Intercession on the Nerl <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>example</b> of Russian orthodox architecture in the Middle Ages. The Urnes stave church (Urnes stavkyrkje) in Norway is a superb example of a medieval stave church.|$|E
50|$|The {{boundaries}} of the reserve <b>are</b> <b>a</b> dry-stone wall on the east and fencing on the other sides. The reserve is considered to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>example</b> of unimproved grassland flora and fauna. The site has <b>been</b> managed as <b>a</b> traditional hay meadow {{for a long period}} of time.|$|R
50|$|Sprezzatura <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{major feature}} of Mannerist art and sculpture, particularly, the bella maniera school {{in which the}} artist {{synthesized}} the best attributes from various sources into a new design. Sprezzatura emphasized virtuosic effects that were displayed with apparent ease and facility. Cellini's Perseus would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>example.</b>|$|R
25|$|St Paul’s Church on {{the corner}} of Canberra Avenue and Captain Cook Crescent, which the Heritage Council {{considers}} to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>example</b> of <b>an</b> Inter-War Gothic church with Art Deco influences. The church was designed by Sydney Architects Burcham Clamp and Son and dedicated on 6 August 1939.|$|R
25|$|Another unique {{building}} is the Voorhees Computing Center (VCC). Originally the St.Joseph's Seminary chapel, built in 1933, {{the building was}} acquired by Rensselaer in 1958, and after renovation served as the institute's library from 1960 until {{the completion of the}} new Folsom Library, in 1976. The Folsom Library, located adjacent to the computing center, has a concrete exterior that was designed to harmonize with the light gray brick of the chapel; architecturally, it <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>example</b> of the modern brutalist style. Subsequently, the university was unsure {{of what to do with}} the chapel, or whether to keep it at all, but in 1979 decided to preserve it and renovate it to house computer labs and facilities to support the institute's computing initiatives. Today the VCC serves as the backbone for the institute's data and telephony infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|Currently it {{is unknown}} which {{mechanism}} {{gave rise to the}} initial duplication of the amylase gene, and it can imply that the insertion of the retroviral sequences was due to non-homologous end joining, which caused the duplication of the AMY1 gene. However, there is currently no evidence to support this theory and therefore this hypothesis remains conjecture. The recent origin of the multi-copy AMY1 gene implies that depending on the environment, the AMY1 gene copy number can increase and decrease very rapidly relative to genes that do not interact as directly with the environment. The AMY1 gene <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>example</b> of how gene dosage affects the survival of an organism in a given environment. The multiple copies of the AMY1 gene gives those who rely more heavily on high starch diets an evolutionary advantage, therefore the high gene copy number persists in the population.|$|E
25|$|The {{glow of a}} flame is complex. Black-body {{radiation}} is emitted from soot, gas, and fuel particles, though the soot particles {{are too small to}} behave like perfect blackbodies. There is also photon emission by de-excited atoms and molecules in the gases. Much of the {{radiation is}} emitted in the visible and infrared bands. The color depends on temperature for the black-body radiation, and on chemical makeup for the emission spectra. The dominant color in a flame changes with temperature. The photo of the forest fire in Canada <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>example</b> of this variation. Near the ground, where most burning is occurring, the fire is white, the hottest color possible for organic material in general, or yellow. Above the yellow region, the color changes to orange, which is cooler, then red, which is cooler still. Above the red region, combustion no longer occurs, and the uncombusted carbon particles are visible as black smoke.|$|E
50|$|The Squash Courts {{were once}} lit by natural light, but the former roof has now <b>been</b> {{replaced}} by <b>a</b> mezzanine ceiling. The courts <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>example</b> of early squash courts. The balcony is particularly noteworthy as the courts were designed in {{back to back}} format which is quite rare.|$|R
50|$|Exceptional {{works of}} Gothic {{architecture}} {{can also be}} found on the islands of Sicily and Cyprus, in the walled cities of Nicosia and Famagusta. Also, the roofs of the Old Town Hall in Prague and Znojmo Town Hall Tower in the Czech Republic <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>example</b> of late Gothic craftsmanship.|$|R
50|$|De Zeeuw is {{considered}} by many to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> <b>example</b> of professionalism in the modern game. He refused to retaliate after El Hadji Diouf spat in his face during a match at the Reebok Stadium in November 2004. His response was to score the winning goal in Portsmouth's 1-0 victory.|$|R
