Against Division I FCS James Madison, Smith caught eight passes for 80yards, rushed twice for 22yards and a touchdown, and returned four kickoffs 127yards, including one 81-yard touchdown return. Despite the strong statistical performance, head coach Ralph Friedgen said, [...] "To be honest with you, I was kind of expecting more out of Torrey. I've {{got a lot of}} faith in him. I'm not surprised at all about the return yards. But I think if you asked Torrey, he has high expectations for himself, too." [...] Smith agreed with the criticism, and acknowledged that in his second season as a wide receiver, he had room for improvement. He recorded five catches for 165yards and two touchdowns in the Middle Tennessee game, and caught four passes for 112yards against Rutgers. He led the team with three receptions for 64yards and a 29-yard touchdown against Clemson, and became the first player in the nation to reach 1,000all-purpose yards on the season. Against Wake Forest, Smith returned six kickoffs 194yards and caught a career-high ten passes for 70yards and a touchdown. For his performance, he was named the Atlantic Coast Conference Specialist of the Week. Wake Forest head coach Jim Grobe said, [...] "This kid is probably a better receiver [...] He catches the ball better, he's got great foot speed. He can hurt you running the ball or catching it. <b>Everywhere</b> <b>you</b> <b>look,</b> he's a problem." ...|$|E

6000|$|Too {{long have}} I owed you {{a letter and}} too many times have your generosities made me blush for my silence. I have {{received}} beautiful books from you and they have given me almost more pleasure as signs of your remembrance than as symbols of your wisdom and worth. The Purgatorio reached me just before I came abroad--or a short time--and I was delighted {{to know that you}} continue to find time and strength for labours so various and so arduous. Great glory is yours--for making something else come out of America than railway-smashes and young ladies for lords. During a singularly charming month that I have been spending in this most loveable old city I have often thought of you and wished I had a small fraction of your power to put the soul of history into Italian things. But I believe I shouldn't love Siena any better even if I knew it better. I am very happy indeed to feel that--as I grow older--many things come and go, but Italy remains. I have been here many times--regularly every year or almost, for many years now, but the spell, the charm, the magic is still in the air. I always try, between May and August, to give London a wide berth, and I find these parts far and away most pleasant when the summer has begun and the barbarians have fled. As one stays and stays on here--I mean on this spot--one feels how untouched Siena really is by the modern hand. Yesterday was the Palio of the ten contrade, and though I believe it is not so intense a festival as the second one--of Aug. 15th (you have probably--or certainly--seen them both)--it was a most curious and characteristic (of an uninterrupted tradition) spectacle. The Marchese Chigi asked me and a couple of friends--or rather asked them, and me with them--to see it from the balcony of his extraordinarily fine old palace, where by the way he has a large collection of Etruscan and Tarentine treasures--a collection to break the heart of envy. My friends were Paul Bourget, the French essayist and novelist (some of whose work you probably know,) and his very remarkably charming, cultivated and interesting young wife. They have been living in Italy these two years--ever since their marriage, and I have been living much with them here. Bourget is a very interesting mind--and figure altogether--and the first--easily, to my sense--of all the talkers I have ever encountered. But it would take me much too far to begin to give you a portrait of such a complicated cosmopolitan Frenchman as he! But they departed, alas, this morning, for the Piedmontese Alps, and I take my way, in a couple of hours, to Venice, where I spend but a few days--with perhaps a few more at Asolo--before joining my brother William and his wife for a month in Switzerland. After that I expect to return to London for the last of the summer and the early autumn--the season I prefer there above all others. But before I do this I wish I could talk to you more about this sweet old Siena. I have been talking for a month about it with Bourget--but how much better it would have been for both of us if you could have broken in and taken up the tale! But you did, sometimes, very happily--for Mme. Paul knows you by heart (she is the Madonna of cosmopolitan culture) and cites you with great effect. Have you read P. B.'s Sensations d'Italie? If you haven't, do--it {{is one of the most}} exquisite of books. Have you read any of his novels? If you haven't, don't, though they have remarkable parts. Make an exception, however, for Terre Promise, which is to appear a few months hence, and which I have been reading in proof, here--if on trial, indeed, you find you can stand so suffocating an analysis. It is perhaps [...] "psychology" [...] gone mad--but it is an extraordinary production. A fortnight ago, on a singularly lovely Sunday, we drove to San Gimignano and back. I had never been there before, and the whole day was a delight. There are of course four Americans living at San G.--one of whom proved afterwards to have been an American [...] "lady-newspaper-correspondent" [...] furious at having missed two such birds as Bourget and me--whom a single stone from that rugged old quarry would have brought down. But she didn't know us until we had departed and we fortunately didn't suspect her till a suppliant card reached us two days later at Siena. We were in the hands of the good old Canonico--the proposito, as they call him--and he put us gently through. You remember well enough of course--though to such a far-away world your Siena summer must seem to belong--the rich loveliness, at this moment, of this exquisite old Tuscany. One can't say enough about it, and the way the great sea of growing things--the corn and the vines and the olives--breaks in green surges at the very foot of the old golden-brown ramparts, is one of the most enchanting features of Siena. There is still never a suburb to speak of save in the quarter of the railway-station, and <b>everywhere</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> out of back-windows and back-doors and off terraces and over parapets straight down into the golden grain and the tangled poderi. Every evening we have gone to walk in the Lizza and hang over the bastions of the Castello; where the near views and the far, and the late afternoons and the sunsets and the mountains have made us say again and again that we could never, never go away. But we are coming back, and I greatly wish you were. We went the other day to the archivio, which I had never seen before, and where I was amazed and fascinated. (It is a great luxury to be in Italy with a French celebrity--he is so tremendously known and well treated, as the [...] "likes" [...] of us can never be, and one comes in for some of his privileges.) You of course probably know, however, what the fullness, detail, continuity and curiosity of the records of this place are--filling with their visible, palpable medievalism the great upper chamber of Pal. Piccolomini.|$|E

There were mechanical bulls, mechanical horses, mechanical calves. The mattresses that supported the fall from the bull were supplied by Cryer. He would ride around Pasadena with various tips for mattresses that were being thrown out. Gilley's had staged everything from Dolly Parton look-alike contests to tricycle races. The cowboys looked so funny trying to ride the tricycles but they would fall off and make everyone laugh. It was the mechanical bull that made the cowboys come in every night. Crystal Gale was a featured entertainer at the club with hundreds other country singers. Cryer and Gilley thought there would be a lot of lawsuits but there were none. With a sign bearing [...] "Ride At Your Own Risk" [...] they did just that. Men would come down and get on to impress their girls. But when it finally threw them they would get back on and yell,"Turn it up"!. The bull has since then been popularized because of Cryer.|$|R
