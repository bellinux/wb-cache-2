40|$|The oft-neglected {{issue of}} the causal {{structure}} in the flat spacetime approach to Einstein's theory of gravity is considered. Consistency requires that the <b>flat</b> metric's null <b>cone</b> be respected, {{but this does not}} automatically happen. After reviewing the history of this problem, we introduce a generalized eigenvector formalism to give a kinematic description of the relation between the two null cones, based on the Segre' classification of symmetric rank 2 tensors with respect to a Lorentzian metric. Then we propose a method to enforce special relativistic causality by using the gauge freedom to restrict the configuration space suitably. A set of new variables just covers this smaller configuration space and respects the <b>flat</b> metric's null <b>cone</b> automatically. Respecting the <b>flat</b> metric's null <b>cone</b> ensures that the spacetime is globally hyperbolic, indicating that the Hawking black hole information loss paradox does not arise in the special relativistic approach to Einstein's theory...|$|R

The relevance of long strings to one-loop black hole thermodynamics is em-phasized. We then provide an argument in favor of the absence of α′-corrections for the (quadratic) heterotic thermal scalar action in Rindler space. We also compute the large k limit of the cigar orbifold partition functions (for both bosonic and type II superstrings) which allows a better comparison between the <b>flat</b> <b>cones</b> and the cigar cones. A discussion is made on the general McClain-Roth-O’Brien-Tan theorem and on the fact that different torus embeddings lead to different aspects of string thermodynamics. The black hole/string correspondence principle for the 2 d black hole is discussed in terms of the thermal scalar.

Supplementary, techniques have been applied to investigate the quality of the layer on the substrate itself. It could be shown, that the mean droplet diameters obtained in the spray cone of a water borne paint spray are a strong function of the distance from the target, indicating the loss of small droplets following the radially directed air flow near the target, as expected. These small droplets form the so-called overspray, i. e. the fraction of paint which does not reach the substrate. The experimental results have been used as input data for a numerical program for the calculation of two-phase flows based on the time-averaged Navier-Stokes equations in connection with the k-E turbulence model and the Lagrangian particle tracking method.

Designing {{rotational}} symmetries on surfaces is an important task {{for a wide range}} of graphics applications. This work introduces a rigorous and practical algorithm for automatic N-RoSy design on arbitrary surfaces with user defined field topologies. The user has full control of the number, positions and indices of the singulari-ties, the turning numbers of the loops, and is able to edit the field interactively. We formulate N-RoSy field construction as designing a Riemannian metric, such that the global symmetry of the metric is compatible with the local symmetry of N-RoSy. We prove the compatibility condition using discrete parallel transportation. The complexity of N-RoSy field design is caused by curvatures. In our work, we propose to simplify the Riemannian metric to make it flat almost everywhere. This approach greatly simplifies the process and improves the flexibility, such that, it can design N-RoSy fields with single singularity, and mixed-RoSy. This approach can also be generalized to construct regular remeshing on surfaces. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply our design system to pen-and-ink sktetching and geometry remeshing. Furthermore, based on our remeshing results with high global sym-metry, we generate Celtic knots on surfaces directly...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{renormalization}} group flows of two-dimensional metrics in sigma models and {{demonstrate that they}} provide a continual analogue of the Toda field equations based on the infinite dimensional algebra G(d/dt; 1). The resulting Toda field equation is a non-linear generalization of the heat equation, which is integrable in target space and shares the same dissipative properties in time. We provide the general solution of the renormalization group flows in terms of free fields, via Backlund transformations, and present some simple examples that illustrate the validity of their formal power series expansion in terms of algebraic data. We study in detail the sausage model that arises as geometric deformation of the O(3) sigma model, and give a new interpretation to its ultra-violet limit by gluing together two copies of Witten's two-dimensional black hole in the asymptotic region. We also provide some new solutions that describe the renormalization group flow of negatively curved spaces in different patches, which look like a cane in the infra-red region.
