The iron sulfide can react with water and oxygen to form iron sulfates and sulfuric acid, which then can produce Bynesian decay.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{histories of}} British and Irish castles were recorded, albeit <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>somewhat</b> fragmented fashion, by John Leland in the 16th century and, by the 19th century, historical analysis of castles had become popular. Victorian historians such as George Clark and John Parker concluded that British castles {{had been built}} {{for the purposes of}} military defence, but believed that their history was pre-Conquest – concluding that the mottes across the countryside had been built by either the Romans or Celts.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{independent}} {{existence of the}} Commonwealth ended with the partitions of Poland in 1795, {{the institution of the}} sejmik continued, albeit <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>somewhat</b> restricted fashion. In the Duchy of Warsaw, sejmiks elected deputies to the Sejm of the Duchy of Warsaw. Similarly, sejmiks of Congress Poland elected deputies to the Sejm of Congress Poland until its abolishment in 1831. Even in the Lithuanian territories incorporated into the Russian Empire, some judicial sejmiks were allowed to elect lower court judges; it was the only elective representative institution to survive in the Lithuanian territories after the partition. In the Prussian partition there were provincial sejmiks (Provinziallandtag) and powiat sejmiks (Kreistag). Near the turn of the century, some limited local representative institutions existed in the Russian partition and Austrian partition, but they did not bear the name of sejmiks.|$|E

5|$|Nosanchuk then {{considered}} {{whether or}} not to call Lamb to the stand on his own behalf at the trial. He already had a strong defence, with five psychiatrists firmly behind him as well as George Scott of Kingston Penitentiary, who had agreed to testify on his behalf. The lawyer considered the boy's probable reaction to a cross-examination by the prosecution in court. Lamb appeared calm and collected on the surface, and had so far answered questions about right and wrong <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>somewhat</b> rational way. Although the doctors had been able to see Lamb's answers for what they really were, Nosanchuk feared that Lamb's appearance could actually lead the jury to believe that he was sane, which might lead to a guilty verdict and the gallows. He therefore did not call Lamb to the stand.|$|E
5|$|The clergy {{was divided}} into two types: the secular clergy, who lived out in the world, and the regular clergy, who lived under a {{religious}} rule and were usually monks. Throughout the period monks remained a very small proportion of the population, usually less than one per cent. Most of the regular clergy were drawn from the nobility, the same social class {{that served as the}} recruiting ground for the upper levels of the secular clergy. The local parish priests were often drawn from the peasant class. Townsmen were <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>somewhat</b> unusual position, as they did not fit into the traditional three-fold division of society into nobles, clergy, and peasants. During the 12th and 13th centuries, the ranks of the townsmen expanded greatly as existing towns grew and new population centres were founded. But throughout the Middle Ages the population of the towns probably never exceeded 10 per cent of the total population.|$|E
5|$|The young Ueshiba {{was raised}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>somewhat</b> privileged setting. His father Yoroku was a wealthy gentleman farmer and minor politician, being an elected {{member of the}} Nishinotani village council for 22 {{consecutive}} years. His mother Yuki was from the Itokawa clan, a prominent local family who could trace their lineage back to the Heian period. Ueshiba was a rather weak, sickly child and bookish in his inclinations. At a young age his father encouraged him to take up sumo wrestling and swimming and entertained him with stories of his great-grandfather Kichiemon, who was considered a very strong samurai in his era. The need for such strength was further emphasized when the young Ueshiba witnessed his father being attacked by followers of a competing politician.|$|E

He also served the Prince <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>somewhat</b> unofficial capacity, assisting the Prince's work and observing the ministry's various goings-on. Under the Prince's directions, ML Pin became an instructor in mathematics, Thai, and English at Chulalongkorn University, {{in addition to the}} various duties he performed for the ministry. In 1934, he became head of the university's teacher-preparation programme and headmaster of the Horwang Secondary School of Chulalongkorn University, which served as the country's first demonstration (teacher training) school. He began developing projects for the school, although few of them were realised at the time. One such project was the creation of the country's first school workshop.|$|E
5|$|Varney the Vampire was a {{landmark}} popular mid-Victorian era gothic horror story by James Malcolm Rymer and Thomas Peckett Prest, which first appeared from 1845 to 1847 {{in a series}} of pamphlets generally referred to as penny dreadfuls because of their inexpensive price and typically gruesome contents. The story was published in book form in 1847 and runs to 868 double-columned pages. It has a distinctly suspenseful style, using vivid imagery to describe the horrifying exploits of Varney. Another important addition to the genre was Sheridan Le Fanu's lesbian vampire story Carmilla (1871). Like Varney before her, the vampire Carmilla is portrayed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>somewhat</b> sympathetic light as the compulsion of her condition is highlighted.|$|E
5|$|Redevelopment of the {{disturbance}} {{was a possibility}} following its degeneration, and on August19, convection once again increased, prompting the JTWC to resume monitoring {{the system as a}} tropical depression at 0900UTC, with the JMA following suit nine hours later. Due to slight wind shear, the depression's circulation center remained slightly displaced from the stronger convection. At 0600UTC on August20, the JTWC determined that {{the disturbance}} had intensified to reach tropical storm status. Upon the 1200UTC upgrade to such an intensity by the JMA, the tropical cyclone was assigned the name Krovanh. Subsequently, following reclassification, Krovanh began to quickly intensify as it tracked <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>somewhat</b> southwest bearing. By August21, the tropical storm had begun to develop a banding eye feature. At 0600UTC that day, the JMA upgraded Krovanh to severe tropical storm intensity, whilst the JTWC indicated that the storm intensified into a typhoon. On August22, the JMA reassessed Krovanh as a typhoon and determined that the storm had reached its peak intensity with winds of 120km/h (75mph). Meanwhile, the JTWC analyzed the storm to have peaked with one-minute sustained winds of 165km/h (105mph); this was followed by the storm making landfall on Luzon, just north of Palanan, Isabela, at 1115UTC later that day.|$|E

5|$|The first Allied {{landings}} on {{the beach}} occurred on 9 September, with two regiments of Middleton's 45th Infantry Division, the 157th and 179th Infantry, landing the following day. The other regiment of the division, the 180th, would land at a different point and be held in reserve by Clark. Middleton was responsible for ten miles of beachhead between the British X Corps and the U.S. 36th Infantry Division. The German defensive positions pounded the Allies, who gained little ground {{in the first few}} days of the operation. Lieutenant General Clark, the Fifth Army commander, faltered and sent around a confidential memo indicating that he was contemplating taking the troops back off the beaches. Middleton, telling his staff that they were not leaving, spread around the word to his troops that it was a good time to do some hard fighting. On the morning of 14 September units of the Forty-fifth did some particularly hard fighting at a large tobacco factory, consisting of five imposing stone buildings <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>somewhat</b> circular pattern. The Germans were dug in here, and repulsed the Americans initially, but with the aid of some naval gun fire, the Germans were eventually pushed back. Clark visited the front later that day, and was convinced that his army was going to stay.|$|E
