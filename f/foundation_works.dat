500|$|Work on {{the section}} north of Wellington Street, {{known as the}} Hamilton Interchange, began in October 1969. It was {{partially}} opened on 17 November 1971, but was not completed until 4 October 1972. The final {{part of the project}} to be completed was the Narrows Interchange. Construction began in 1970 with the installation of thirteen caissons, which would house foundation columns. Placement of the caissons was difficult; as well as sinking vertically as intended, they also tilted and slid horizontally. Corrections were made by selective excavation, blasting bedrock, and applying tension via guy-wires. Following the <b>foundation</b> <b>works,</b> construction proceeded swiftly; most of the work was completed by 1972. Premier John Tonkin opened the interchange on 30 November 1973. This initial section functioned only as a distributor for Narrows Bridge traffic accessing Perth's central business district or adjacent areas to the north-west.
