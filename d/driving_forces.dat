Under the Constitution of Australia, defence responsibility was now vested in the new federal government. The co-ordination of Australia-wide defensive efforts in the face of Imperial German interest in the Pacific Ocean was one of <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> behind federalism, and the Department of Defence immediately came into being as a result, while the Commonwealth Military Forces (early forerunner of the Australian Army) and Commonwealth Naval Force were also soon established.|$|E
5|$|Thomas is also speculated to {{have been}} one of the <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> behind the Battle of the Neva, a disputed Swedish-Novgorodian {{conflict}} that took place in 1240. The speculation is based on the 14th-century Russian Primary Chronicle mention of Finns and Tavastians fighting on the Swedish side, which according to some historians would have been organized by the bishop. However, as the Chronicle also lists the very unlikely Norwegians as allies, the information is often regarded as mid-14th century propaganda, depicting Sweden as being in control of Norway, Finland and Tavastia.|$|E
5|$|Just {{like the}} player's pilot, {{most of the}} other {{characters}} are low-key. The non-player character Admiral Aken Bosch, however, plays a crucial part in moving the story. As a prominent antagonist from the start, he sparks off a rebellion which escalates the scale of action, and brings in the other antagonist force, the Shivans, into the story. The storytelling took on a character-driven approach with expositions taking the form of cutscenes in which Bosch gives out monologues, revealing the purpose and <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> behind his actions. A few established voice actors were brought in to give a polished touch to the voices in the game. Academy Award nominee Robert Loggia voiced the player's commanding officer, Admiral Petrarch, and Admiral Bosch was voiced by Ronny Cox. Kurtwood Smith and Stephen Baldwin participated in bit roles as well.|$|E

The next day two public ceremonies were also held at the New Orleans Civic Auditorium, where 14,000 seats were sold for each. After Williams' death, a judge ruled that the wedding was not legal because Jones Eshlimar's divorce had not become final until eleven days after she married Williams. Williams' first wife, Audrey, and his mother, Lillie Williams, were the <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> behind having the marriage declared invalid and pursued the matter for years.

5|$|Negro {{became one}} of the <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> in LLL's feud with AAA owner Antonio Peña and his AAA loyalists. Over the years, Negro feuded with the top técnicos of AAA such as La Parka, Jr., Octagón and Latin Lover. Negro's {{position}} as one of AAA's top workers was cemented on March 5, 2000, when he competed in AAA's annual Rey de Reyes tournament. In the opening round, he defeated Dos Caras, Killer and Psicosis II and in the finals, he defeated El Alebrije, Charly Manson and Cibernético to win the 2000 Rey de Reyes tournament. Negro's status as a main eventer caused storyline problems between LLL's leader Cibernético and Abismo Negro, leading to a series of matches between the two to see who should lead Los Vipers. On September 29, 2000, Negro defeated Cibernético in a one on one match at Verano de Escandalo (2000). When the two faced off in a steel cage match at Guerra de Titanes (2000), the match ended without a winner, after which the rivalry between the leader and the deputy leader was put on the back burner. In 2001, Negro almost won Rey de Reyes again, but La Parka, Jr. defeated him in the finals. His string of losses continued at Triplemanía IX, where the LLL team of Abismo Negro, Cibernético, Electroshock and Mascara Maligna lost to Mascara Sagrada, El Alebrije, Octagón and La Parka, Jr. when Negro was forced to submit.|$|E

40|$|It is {{becoming}} increasingly apparent that the strength of GABAergic synaptic transmission is dynamic. One parameter that can establish differences in the actions of GABAergic synapses is the ionic <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> for the chloride-permeable GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A) R). Here we review some of the sophisticated ways in which this ionic <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> can vary within neuronal circuits. This <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> for GABA(A) Rs is subject to tight spatial control, with the distribution of Cl⁻ transporter proteins and channels generating regional variation in the strength of GABA(A) R signalling across a single neuron. GABA(A) R dynamics can result from short-term changes in their <b>driving</b> <b>force,</b> which involve the temporary accumulation or depletion of intracellular Cl⁻. In addition, activity-dependent changes in the expression and function of Cl⁻ regulating proteins can result in long-term shifts in the <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> for GABA(A) Rs. The multifaceted regulation of the ionic <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> for GABA(A) Rs has wide ranging implications for mature brain function, neural circuit development, and disease...|$|R

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} correlations discovered to date is that lithospheric plates attached to downgoing (subducting) plates move much faster than plates not attached to subducting plates. The Pacific plate, for instance, is essentially surrounded by zones of subduction (the so-called Ring of Fire) and moves much faster than the plates of the Atlantic basin, which are attached (perhaps one could say 'welded') to adjacent continents instead of subducting plates. It is thus thought that forces associated with the downgoing plate (slab pull and slab suction) are the <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> which determine the motion of plates, except for those plates which are not being subducted. This view however has been contradicted by a recent study which found that the actual motions of the Pacific Plate and other plates associated with the East Pacific Rise do not correlate mainly with either slab pull or slab push, but rather with a mantle convection upwelling whose horizontal spreading along the bases of the various plates drives them along via viscosity-related traction forces. The <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> of plate motion continue to be active subjects of on-going research within geophysics and tectonophysics.|$|E
