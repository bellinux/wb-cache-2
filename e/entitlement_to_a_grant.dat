5000|$|The {{citizenship}} issue {{continued to}} drag {{out over the}} following year. In early June 2010, the JLP made a motion in parliament to unseat Hay-Webster, soon after JLP Shahine Robinson {{had been removed from}} her own seat following a challenge by PNP member Manley Bowen, leaving the JLP with just a 31-28 majority in parliament. Later that month, she announced that she would not be seeking a fourth term in office, though she denied that the citizenship issue {{had anything to do with}} her decision. A Jamaica Gleaner editorial in September 2010 decried her behaviour as [...] "shameless". In December 2010, the JLP made <b>an</b> application <b>to</b> the Supreme Court of Jamaica challenging Hay-Webster's eligibility to sit in parliament due to the fact of her having been a U.S. citizen at the time of the 2007 elections. Hay-Webster declined to comment on the issue. It is possible that the court may retroactively disqualifies her candidacy all the way back to her original election in 1997, meaning that she might lose her <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> parliamentary pension, <b>granted</b> <b>to</b> members of parliament who serve for more than two terms. In response to the challenge, the PNP stated that it would uphold the constitution, but also expressed concern that the challenge had been filed so late in Hay-Webster's term, possibly contravening the Election Petitions Act. The court papers were finally served on 13 January 2011, with the hearing date set for 17 February. The issue seemed to be going nowhere; in March 2011, Golding admitted he had been dragging out the resolution of the citizenship issue in order to avoid undermining his party's majority in parliament.|$|R
