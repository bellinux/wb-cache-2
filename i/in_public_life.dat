5|$|An {{example of}} Como's {{popularity}} came in 1956, when Life conducted {{a poll of}} young women, asking them which man <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>life</b> most fit the concept of their ideal husband: it was Perry Como. A 1958 nationwide poll of U.S. teenagers found Perry Como {{to be the most}} popular male singer, beating Elvis Presley, who was the winner of the previous year's poll. At one point, his television show was broadcast in at least 12 other countries.|$|E
5|$|Four {{years later}} public attitudes had changed little. When Ian Harvey, a junior Foreign Office {{minister}} in Harold Macmillan's government, {{was found guilty}} of indecent behaviour with a Coldstream Guardsman in November 1958, he lost both his ministerial job and his parliamentary seat at Harrow East. He was ostracised by the Conservative Party and by most of his former friends, and never again held a position <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>life.</b> Thus, anyone entering politics at that time knew that revelations of homosexual activity would likely bring such a career to a swift end.|$|E

5|$|Having {{successfully}} {{dealt with}} the major challenges and issues involved in forming a new state government, Shelby left the state safe and financially sound. Kentucky's constitution prevented a governor from serving consecutive terms, so Shelby retired to Traveler's Rest, his Lincoln County estate, {{at the conclusion of}} his term in 1796. For the next 15 years he tended to affairs on his farm. He was selected as a presidential elector in six consecutive elections, but these were his only appearances <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>life</b> during this period.|$|E
5|$|In May 1916, Minton {{returned}} to New Albany, where {{he opened a}} law practice and renewed his relationship with Gurtz. He took several cases and gained experience working pro bono to assist the local county prosecutor. He joined the Chautauqua lecture circuit, and traveled to several cities to give speeches. During one lecture circuit, he met William Jennings Bryan. The three-time Presidential candidate advised the young Hoosier about politics, inspiring him to consider a career <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E

William died after 1179 and was succeeded by his son, William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber, who gained the favour of both King Richard I and King John and became a dominant force in the Welsh Marches during their reigns.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year Ingres sought to capitalise {{on the success}} of his Bertin portrait. He showed his ambitious history painting The Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian at the 1834 Salon, but it was harshly criticised; even Ingres' admirers offered only faint praise. Offended and frustrated, Ingres declared he would disown the Salon, abandon his residence in Paris for Rome, and relinquish all current positions, ending his role <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>life.</b> This petulance was not to last.|$|E
5|$|In 318 BCE, Cassander {{appointed}} Demetrius Phalereus {{to govern}} the city-state of Athens. Demetrius issued a set of laws that are known from later literary works. Although knowledge of these laws is fragmentary, {{it does not appear}} that Demetrius legislated anything on the subject of epikleroi. This is in striking contrast to Solon's legislation, which was concerned with the internal affairs of the family and its external manifestations <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>life.</b> By the 4th century BCE, the practice of the epiklerate was falling into disuse, and it disappeared during the Hellenistic Period, although it continued to appear in New Comedy and scattered inscriptions from the 3rd century BCE, if dated correctly, refer to occasional epikleroi. One method that developed to avoid the epiklerate was through the adoption of a son by the father of a possible epikleros.|$|E
5|$|In September 1918, Eleanor was {{unpacking}} one of Franklin's suitcases {{when she}} discovered a bundle of love letters to him from her social secretary, Lucy Mercer. He had been contemplating leaving Eleanor for Lucy. However, following pressure from his political advisor, Louis Howe, and from his mother, who threatened to disinherit Franklin if he followed through with a divorce, the couple remained married. Their union {{from that point on}} was more of a political partnership. Disillusioned, Eleanor again became active <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>life,</b> and focused increasingly on her social work rather than her role as a wife, as she had for the previous decade.|$|E

40|$|Historians {{have argued}} that {{religion}} has {{lost much of its}} social impact as a result of increasing secularization during the 20 th century.

By looking at the attention that Williams received in the media during his time as Archbishop the dissertation shows how active a public figure he was <b>in</b> British <b>public</b> <b>life.</b> <b>In</b> doing so the dissertation opens up new channels for future historical research on the impact of religion <b>in</b> British <b>public</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> the 21 st century</p...|$|R

5|$|Khánh {{selected}} a cabinet of thirteen ministers and two Secretaries of State at ministerial level, and chose new provincial and district chiefs. He originally tried to include {{members of a}} variety of political and religious groups including representatives of the Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo sects, who still had remnants of their private armies intact after their defeat by Diệm in 1955. Although Khánh insisted that he had no party affiliation, the orientation of his government was toward the Đại Việt, who held many of the key posts in the government. This provoked bitterness from other anti-communist nationalists and groups that were banned under Diệm and were seeking a greater role <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>life,</b> as well as from a younger generation who felt that the established nationalist parties were responsible for dividing the people.|$|E
5|$|Pick had {{a strong}} {{interest}} in design and its use <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>life.</b> He steered the development of the London Underground's corporate identity by commissioning eye-catching commercial art, graphic design and modern architecture, establishing a highly recognisable brand, including the first versions of the roundel and typeface still used today. Under his direction, the UERL's Underground network and associated bus services expanded considerably reaching out into new areas and stimulating the growth of London's suburbs. His impact on the growth of London between the world wars led to him being likened to Baron Haussmann and Robert Moses.|$|E
5|$|Reitz had an {{extremely}} varied political and judicial career {{that lasted for}} over forty-five years and spanned four separate political entities: the Cape Colony, the Orange Free State, the South African Republic, and the Union of South Africa. Trained as a lawyer in Cape Town and London, Reitz started off in law practice and diamond prospecting before being appointed Chief Justice of the Orange Free State. In the Orange Free State Reitz {{played an important role}} in the modernisation of the legal system and the state's administrative organisation. At the same time he was also prominent <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>life,</b> getting involved in the Afrikaner language and culture movement, and cultural life in general.|$|E

5|$|At the {{university}} Goldstone {{became involved in}} the international effort to end South Africa's apartheid system. He had been brought up in an anti-apartheid atmosphere; although his parents were not activists, they were opposed to racial discrimination and this was to have a profound influence on his later career. Like many other South African Jews, he chose to become conspicuously active <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>life</b> in an effort to oppose or alleviate the worst aspects of apartheid. While he was chairman of {{the university}}'s Students' Representative Council, he campaigned against the exclusion of black students. He also attracted attention from the state security police by having contact with anti-apartheid groups within South Africa, including the African National Congress, which was a banned organisation at the time. On one occasion he secretly tape-recorded a spy sent by the police to infiltrate the anti-apartheid student movement at the university. The recording was later used as evidence in the firing of the national police commissioner.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Ann Romney {{learned that}} she had {{multiple}} sclerosis; Mitt described watching her fail a series of neurological tests as {{the worst day of}} his life. After experiencing two years of severe difficulties with the disease, she found– while living in Park City, Utah, where the couple had built a vacation home– a combination of mainstream, alternative, and equestrian therapies that enabled her to lead a lifestyle mostly without limitations. When her husband received a job offer to take over the troubled organization responsible for the 2002 Winter Olympics and Paralympics, to be held in Salt Lake City in Utah, she urged him to accept it; eager for a new challenge, as well as another chance to prove himself <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>life,</b> he did. On February 11, 1999, the Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games of 2002 hired Romney as its president and CEO.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1998 Act, whistleblowers in the United Kingdom had no {{protection}} against being dismissed by their employer. Although they could avoid being sued for {{breach of confidence}} thanks to a public interest defence, this did not prevent subtle or open victimisation in the workplace, including disciplinary action, dismissal, failure to gain promotion or a pay rise. During the early to mid-1990s, interest in whistleblower protection grew, partially because {{of a series of}} financial scandals and health and safety accidents, which investigations into showed could have been prevented if employees had been permitted to voice their concerns, and partially because of the work of the Committee on Standards <b>in</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Life.</b> In 1995 and 1996, two private member's bills dealing with whistleblowers were introduced to Parliament, by Tony Wright and Don Touhig respectively, but both efforts fell through. When Richard Shepherd proposed a similar bill, however, he got government support for it on the condition that it be an amendment to the Employment Rights Act 1996 rather than a new area of law in its own right. Public Concern at Work, a UK-based whistleblowers charity, was involved in the drafting and consultation stages of the bill. The case of Graham Pink added to the pressure to introduce whistleblower protection legislation.|$|E

5|$|The Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 (c.23) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{that protects}} whistleblowers from {{detrimental}} treatment by their employer. Influenced by various financial scandals and accidents, {{along with the}} report of the Committee on Standards <b>in</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Life,</b> the bill was introduced to Parliament by Richard Shepherd and given government support, on the condition that it become an amendment to the Employment Rights Act 1996. After receiving the Royal Assent on 2 July 1998, the Act came into force on 2 July 1999. It protects employees who make disclosures of certain types of information, including evidence of illegal activity or damage to the environment, from retribution from their employers, such as dismissal or being passed over for promotion. In cases where such retribution takes place the employee may bring a case before an employment tribunal, which can award compensation.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} {{determine}} if and when to become pregnant, is vital to a woman's autonomy and well being, and contraception can protect girls and young women from the risks of early pregnancy and older women from the increased risks of unintended pregnancy. Adequate access to contraception can limit multiple pregnancies, {{reduce the need for}} potentially unsafe abortion and reduce maternal and infant mortality and morbidity. Some barrier forms of contraception such as condoms, also reduce the risk of STIs and HIV infection. Access to contraception allows women to make informed choices about their reproductive and sexual health, increases empowerment, and enhances choices in education, careers and participation <b>in</b> <b>public</b> <b>life.</b> At the societal level, access to contraception is a key factor in controlling population growth, with resultant impact on the economy, the environment and regional development. Consequently, the United Nations considers access to contraception a human right that is central to gender equality and women's empowerment that saves lives and reduces poverty, and birth control has been considered amongst the 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.|$|E
