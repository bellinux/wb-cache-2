5|$|Ryu has {{the ability}} to jump on and off ladders and walls, and by using the <b>directional</b> pad, he can climb up or down ladders. Ryu can spring off walls by holding the <b>directional</b> pad in the {{opposite}} direction he is facing and pressing the jump button. He cannot attack while on walls or ladders. Players can use this technique to get Ryu to climb up spaces between walls and columns by holding down the jump button and alternating between left and right on the <b>directional</b> pad. Ryu can also vertically climb a single wall by springing off it and then quickly pressing the <b>directional</b> pad back towards the wall.|$|E
5|$|<b>Directional</b> {{anisotropy}} {{refers to}} a difference in diffusion mechanism or rate in a particular direction on a given crystallographic plane. These differences may {{be a result of}} either anisotropy in the surface lattice (e.g. a rectangular lattice) or the presence of steps on a surface. One of the more dramatic examples of <b>directional</b> anisotropy is the diffusion of adatoms on channeled surfaces such as fcc (110), where diffusion along the channel is much faster than diffusion across the channel.|$|E
5|$|Generally, blue signage {{is used to}} list {{services}} and attractions at upcoming exits, known as Tourism-Oriented <b>Directional</b> Signing.|$|E
5|$|Cheyenne {{prototype}} #6 (s/n 66-8831) began conducting weapons {{testing at}} Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona, demonstrating {{the ability for}} the gunner and pilot to accurately fire on separate targets on each side on the helicopter. Towards the end of 1970, the Army funded work on TOW missile guidance and night sighting systems. Prototypes #6 and #9 were also tested and evaluated at Yuma Proving Ground from 30 January to 23 December 1971, to determine if stability and control systems were sufficient. Deficiencies were identified in lateral <b>directional</b> stability, uncommanded motion during maneuvering, high vibration, and poor <b>directional</b> control during sidewards flying.|$|E
5|$|Studies by Wehner in the Sahara desert ant (Cataglyphis bicolor) {{demonstrate}} effective path integration {{to determine}} <b>directional</b> heading (by polarized light or sun position) and to compute distance (by monitoring leg movement or optical flow).|$|E
5|$|The coupled {{output from}} the <b>directional</b> coupler {{can be used}} to monitor {{frequency}} and power level on the signal without interrupting the main power flow in the system (except for a power reduction – see figure 3).|$|E
5|$|The game is {{a simple}} forward-scrolling rail shooter, similar to the Star Fox series. Only the Game Boy Advance's <b>directional</b> pad, A, and Start buttons are used during gameplay. The ship remains locked at a set speed and cannot brake or speed up.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnitude}} of winds offshore are {{nearly double the}} wind speed observed onshore. This is attributed to the differences in friction between land masses and offshore waters. Sometimes, there are even <b>directional</b> differences, particularly if local sea breezes change the wind on shore during daylight hours.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} minor {{problems}} surfaced, but were readily fixed. The yaw damper of the XF-104 {{was found to}} be ineffective and the rudder did not positively center, these problems were corrected by revising the rudder control system. The unpowered rudder did not provide adequate <b>directional</b> control at high air speeds (remedied by using hydraulic power on all subsequent versions of the F-104) and some concern was expressed over poor subsonic maneuverability at higher altitudes.|$|E
5|$|A planned {{modification}} of the existing route encompasses construction of a <b>directional</b> T interchange to replace the existing trumpet interchange built at Žuta Lokva. The new interchange is only planned to be built once the A7 motorway is completed between the Rijeka bypass and Žuta Lokva. It shall not feature any weaving, similar to the Bosiljevo2 interchange of the A1 and A6 motorways.|$|E
5|$|A {{recently}} completed project added two new <b>directional</b> ramps for traffic {{directed to the}} airport and to southbound SR 143 destined for I-10 and reconstructed an existing loop ramp from northbound SR 143 to westbound Sky Harbor Boulevard. There are no additional plans to upgrade or reconstruct any portions of the nearly four-mile expressway.|$|E
5|$|A second {{method of}} rear delay array {{combines}} end-fire topology with polarity reversal, using two subwoofers positioned front to back, the drivers spaced one-quarter wavelength apart, the rear enclosure inverted in polarity and delayed {{by a few}} milliseconds for maximum cancellation on stage of the target frequency. This method has the least output power directed toward the audience, compared to other <b>directional</b> methods.|$|E
5|$|Acurad was a {{die casting}} process {{developed}} by General Motors {{in the late}} 1950s and 1960s. The name is an acronym for accurate, reliable, and dense. It was developed to combine a stable fill and <b>directional</b> solidification with the fast cycle times of the traditional die casting process. The process pioneered four breakthrough technologies for die casting: thermal analysis, flow and fill modeling, heat treatable and high integrity die castings, and indirect squeeze casting (explained below).|$|E
5|$|All {{actinides}} are pyrophoric, {{especially when}} finely divided, that is, they spontaneously ignite upon reaction with air. The melting point of actinides {{does not have}} a clear dependence on the number of f-electrons. The unusually low melting point of neptunium and plutonium (~640°C) is explained by hybridization of 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of <b>directional</b> bonds in these metals.|$|E
5|$|Although {{many people}} believe this owl has {{exceptional}} night vision, its retina is no more sensitive than a human's and its asymmetrically placed ears are key to its hunting by giving it excellent <b>directional</b> hearing. Its nocturnal habits and eerie, easily imitated call, {{have led to a}} mythical association of the tawny owl with bad luck and death.|$|E
5|$|Assigned {{the serial}} number 1440, the XSO2U-1 flew for the first time, as a landplane, in July 1939; its first flight as a {{seaplane}} took place that December. Flight testing of the SO2U showed that the aircraft lacked <b>directional</b> stability; {{the addition of a}} large ventral fin, connecting the rear of the float to the tail, helped to cure the problem.|$|E
5|$|Downbursts. When an outflow {{boundary}} forms due to {{a shallow}} layer of rain-cooled air spreading out near ground level from the parent thunderstorm, both speed and <b>directional</b> wind shear can result {{at the leading edge}} of the three dimensional boundary. The stronger the outflow boundary is, the stronger the resultant vertical wind shear will become.|$|E
5|$|ECTunes is {{developing}} a system that utilizes <b>directional</b> sound equipment to emit noise when {{and where it is}} needed. According to the company, its technology sends audible signals only in the direction of travel, thus allowing the vehicle to be heard by those who may be in the car's path, without disturbing others with unwelcome noise. Insero Horsens, a Danish venture company, has provided a significant investment to help ECTunes fully develop its technology.|$|E
5|$|East of Montrose Road, {{the highway}} is a four lane roadway divided by a raised paved median, and passes north {{of a forest}} as it {{approaches}} an interchange with the QEW. As well as a partial cloverleaf interchange that provides almost all <b>directional</b> movements, this four-level stack interchange features two flyovers that arc from south to east {{as well as a}} four lane mainline that curves from north to east, directing most westbound Highway420 traffic onto the Toronto-bound QEW.|$|E
5|$|Enhanced {{geothermal}} systems (EGS) actively inject {{water into}} wells {{to be heated}} and pumped back out. The water is injected under high pressure to expand existing rock fissures to enable the water to freely flow in and out. The technique was adapted from oil and gas extraction techniques. However, the geologic formations are deeper and no toxic chemicals are used, reducing the possibility of environmental damage. Drillers can employ <b>directional</b> drilling to expand {{the size of the}} reservoir.|$|E
5|$|I-695 turns south past MD 43 and {{interchanges}} with US 1 (Belair Road) {{south of}} White Marsh. The road continues southeast to an interchange with I-95 (John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway) {{a short distance}} after US 1 in Rossville. This interchange with I-95 (to east of Baltimore city) is a fully <b>directional</b> interchange where the carriageways of both routes crossed over each other onto the opposite side, then crossed over each other again; {{at the site of}} each crossover, left-hand entrance and exit ramps were provided to eliminate the need for <b>directional</b> flyovers. In 2008, interchange reconstruction at the I-95 interchange removed the left-hand entrance from northbound I-95 to westbound I-695 with the remaining left-hand entrances to be removed by August 2009 as part of the construction of the I-95 Express Toll Lane Project; all exits and entrances were now on the right, and I-95's opposing roadways no longer crossed each other (but I-695's still did).|$|E
5|$|In 1947, {{before the}} flight {{testing of the}} prototypes was completed, 30 {{production}} aircraft were ordered. They incorporated an ejection seat and a redesigned vertical stabilizer {{as well as two}} auxiliary fins, one towards the tip {{on each side of the}} tailplane in an attempt to improve the <b>directional</b> stability of the aircraft. The fuselage was lengthened to fit additional equipment and the wing had fillets added at the rear junction with the fuselage.|$|E
5|$|It {{has long}} been {{believed}} that a male black-throated blue warbler achieves reproductive maturation well into its first breeding season. A yearling participates in extra-pair mating and cuckoldry as much as or even more than older males. However, research by Graves has found opposing evidence in terms of testicular size and sperm production. <b>Directional</b> asymmetry is present in many passerine birds. The left testicle is often larger in size than the right one, and this holds true for both yearling and older male warblers. However, the testicle to body mass ratio nonetheless is much lower in yearlings than in older males. Moreover, older males have {{a greater degree of}} <b>directional</b> asymmetry than do yearlings. Because the size of testes in birds is correlated to the ejaculate quality, it is likely that females employ age-dependent choice in favor of older males who can be distinguished by their definitive age-specific plumage.|$|E
5|$|It {{has some}} {{properties}} that are {{unusual for a}} metal; taken together, these are sometimes used as a basis to classify aluminium as a metalloid. Its crystalline structure shows some evidence of <b>directional</b> bonding. Aluminium bonds covalently in most compounds. The oxide Al2O3 is amphoteric, and a conditional glass-former. Aluminium can form anionic aluminates, such behaviour being considered nonmetallic in character.|$|E
5|$|Laplace's Demon is a {{humanoid}} with a rabbit's head who dwells in the N-field. He is {{the referee}} to the Alice Game and often assists the protagonists through riddles or as a <b>directional</b> guide. He is voiced in Träumend and Ouvertüre by Kyousei Tsukui with English dubbing by Keith Silverstein. In Zurückspulen, he is voiced by Satoshi Mikami and English dubbed by David Wald.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} can act on any heritable phenotypic trait, {{and selective}} pressure {{can be produced}} by any aspect of the environment, including sexual selection and competition {{with members of the}} same or other species. However, this does not imply that natural selection is always <b>directional</b> and results in adaptive evolution; natural selection often results in the maintenance of the status quo by eliminating less fit variants.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium is {{an element}} in which the 5f {{electrons}} are the transition border between delocalized and localized; it is therefore {{considered one of the}} most complex elements. The anomalous behavior of plutonium is caused by its electronic structure. The energy difference between the 6d and 5f subshells is very low. The size of the 5f shell is just enough to allow the electrons to form bonds within the lattice, on the very boundary between localized and bonding behavior. The proximity of energy levels leads to multiple low-energy electron configurations with near equal energy levels. This leads to competing 5fn7s2 and 5fn−16d17s2 configurations, which causes the complexity of its chemical behavior. The highly <b>directional</b> nature of 5f orbitals is responsible for <b>directional</b> covalent bonds in molecules and complexes of plutonium.|$|E
5|$|RNA {{interference}} genes, as {{components of}} the antiviral innate immune system in many eukaryotes, are involved in an evolutionary arms race with viral genes. Some viruses have evolved mechanisms for suppressing the RNAi response in their host cells, particularly for plant viruses. Studies of evolutionary rates in Drosophila have shown that genes in the RNAi pathway are subject to strong <b>directional</b> selection and are among the fastest-evolving genes in the Drosophila genome.|$|E
5|$|Stacking or rigging the subwoofers in a {{vertical}} array focuses the low frequencies {{forward to a}} greater or lesser extent depending on the physical length of the array. Longer arrays have a more <b>directional</b> effect at lower frequencies. The directionality is more pronounced in the vertical dimension, yielding a radiation pattern that is wide but not tall. This helps reduce the amount of low frequency sound bouncing off the ceiling indoors and assists in mitigating external noise complaints outdoors.|$|E
5|$|Superficial or surface anatomy is {{important}} as the study of anatomical landmarks that can be readily seen from the exterior contours of the body. It enables physicians or veterinary surgeons to gauge the position and anatomy of the associated deeper structures. Superficial is a <b>directional</b> term that indicates that structures are located relatively {{close to the surface}} of the body.|$|E
5|$|The episode's teleplay {{was written}} by co-executive {{producer}} David H. Goodman based on a story by executive story editors and scientists Glen Whitman and Robert Chiappetta. It was Goodman's fifth contribution to the series and Whitman and Chiappetta's first. The episode was directed by Norberto Barba, his only <b>directional</b> credit with the series.|$|E
5|$|When some {{component}} of a trait is heritable, selection alters the frequencies of the different alleles, or variants of the gene that produces the variants of the trait. Selection {{can be divided into}} three classes, {{on the basis of its}} effect on allele frequencies: <b>directional,</b> stabilizing, and purifying selection. <b>Directional</b> selection occurs when an allele has a greater fitness than others, so that it increases in frequency, gaining an increasing share in the population. This process can continue until the allele is fixed and the entire population shares the fitter phenotype. Far more common is stabilizing selection, which lowers the frequency of alleles that have a deleterious effect on the phenotype – that is, produce organisms of lower fitness. This process can continue until the allele is eliminated from the population. Purifying selection conserves functional genetic features, such as protein-coding genes or regulatory sequences, over time by selective pressure against deleterious variants.|$|E
25|$|Instead of a D-pad, {{which is}} used for <b>directional</b> {{movement}} in nearly every other console then on the market, the PlayStation controller uses four <b>directional</b> buttons.|$|E
25|$|Many {{hearing aids}} now have both an {{omnidirectional}} and a <b>directional</b> microphone mode. This {{is because the}} wearer may not need or desire the noise-reducing properties of the <b>directional</b> microphone in a given situation. Typically, the omnidirectional microphone mode is used in quiet listening situations (e.g. living room) whereas the <b>directional</b> microphone is used in noisy listening situations (e.g. restaurant). The microphone mode is typically selected manually by the wearer. Some hearing aids automatically switch the microphone mode.|$|E
25|$|They have no <b>directional</b> characteristic.|$|E
25|$|Several {{concepts}} of a derivative {{may be defined}} on a Banach space. See the articles on the Fréchet derivative and the Gâteaux derivative for details. The Fréchet derivative allows for {{an extension of the}} concept of a <b>directional</b> derivative to Banach spaces. The Gâteaux derivative allows for an extension of a <b>directional</b> derivative to locally convex topological vector spaces. Fréchet differentiability is a stronger condition than Gâteaux differentiability. The quasi-derivative is another generalization of <b>directional</b> derivative that implies a stronger condition than Gâteaux differentiability, but a weaker condition than Fréchet differentiability.|$|E
