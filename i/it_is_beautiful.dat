Writing for Variety, Peter Debruge found major flaws {{with the}} film, writing, [...] "Though undeniably gorgeous, it is punishingly long, frequently boring, and woefully unengaging {{at some of}} its most critical moments. It is too subdued for Scorsese-philes, too violent for the most devout, and too abstruse for the great many moviegoers who such an expensive undertaking hopes to attract." [...] John Patterson of The Guardian stated in his review, [...] "I fear that Silence expired in the womb during that long gestation period. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>beautiful</b> to look at, but feels inert, humourless and overly devout (to say nothing of over-long; Masahiro Shinoda's 1971 adaptation got Shūsako Endō's 1966 novel on to film using 30 fewer minutes than Scorsese). Perhaps that leap toward the devout is needed to savour it fully–and I found I couldn't make it." ...|$|E
500|$|Poulenc's {{major works}} for choir and {{orchestra}} are the Stabat Mater (1950), the Gloria (1959–60), and Sept répons des ténèbres (Seven responsories for Tenebrae, 1961–62). All {{these works are}} based on liturgical texts, originally set to Gregorian chant. In the Gloria, Poulenc's faith expresses itself in an exuberant, joyful way, with intervals of prayerful calm and mystic feeling, and an ending of serene tranquillity. Poulenc wrote to Bernac in 1962, [...] "I have finished Les Ténèbres. I think <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>beautiful.</b> With the Gloria and the Stabat Mater, I think I have three good religious works. May they spare me {{a few days in}} Purgatory, if I narrowly avoid going to hell." [...] Sept répons des ténèbres, which Poulenc did not live to hear performed, uses a large orchestra, but in Nichols's view it displays a new concentration of thought. To the critic Ralph Thibodeau, the work may be considered as Poulenc's own requiem and is [...] "the most avant-garde of his sacred compositions, the most emotionally demanding, and the most interesting musically, comparable only with his magnum opus sacrum, the opera, Dialogues des Carmélites." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1998, he {{directed}} the film Those Who Love Me Can Take the Train, a [...] "melodramatic, sentimental and emptily wordy... about {{the interplay of}} assorted characters {{on their way to}} the funeral of a misanthropic, bisexual minor painter (Jean-Louis Trintignant)." [...] The final scene reflects the cemetery of Limoges to the music of Mahler's Tenth Symphony. Chéreau's only English-language film, Intimacy (2001), based on short stories by Hanif Kureishi (who also wrote a novel of the same title in 1998), was played by English actors, including Timothy Spall and Marianne Faithfull, and deals with [...] "the possessiveness of a musician from London who regularly meets a woman for sexual encounters". It [...] "was a tale of sexual obsession which sparked a debate about unsimulated sex on screen. But, Chéreau said, 'It is not like a porno film, not at all erotic sometimes, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>beautiful</b> because it is life." [...] In 2003, {{he directed}} His Brother (Son frère), centred [...] "on the relationship between two estranged brothers, one gay, the other straight. They come together when the latter suffers from a potentially fatal blood disease. The hospital processes are shot unflinchingly, without sentimentality, which makes this meditation on mortality even more moving." [...] Koch notes the similarity of a scene when the moribund is shaved for a last futile surgery he lies on a table similar to Mantegna's Dead Christ. In 2003 Chéreau served at Cannes as president of the jury.|$|E

He begins by showing that [...] "if there is {{anything}} beautiful other than absolute beauty <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>beautiful</b> only insofar as it partakes of absolute beauty". Consequently, as absolute beauty is a Form, and so is the soul, then anything which has the property of being infused with a soul is so infused with the Form of soul. As an example he says, [...] "will not the number three endure annihilation or anything sooner than be converted into an even number, while remaining three?". Forms, then, will never become their opposite. As the soul is that which renders the body living, and that the opposite of life is death, it so follows that, [...] "...the soul will never admit the opposite of what she always brings." [...] That which does not admit death is said to be immortal.|$|E

2500|$|I am {{told that}} the more you rehearse, the better you play. This is wrong.

Allmusic critics [...] Jason Ankenny and Thom Jurek called the album [...] "brilliant" [...] and commented that [...] "With its elegiac tone and deeply autobiographical lyrics, this was a Morrison who didn't so readily associate himself with the feel-good, peace, love, and rhythm & blues sound American audiences were used to." [...] John Kennedy from PopMatters felt <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>beautiful</b> in the sense defined by French poet Charles Baudelaire, [...] "a poet's album, a jazz lover's album, a masterpiece of soul-singing, a blue and green journey into the places of the heart that were first opened up for dowsing [...] with Astral Weeks." [...] Derek Miller of Stylus Magazine believed it is astonishing, [...] "so frothy and thick, that requires silence when it's over ... To me that's the better explanation for Morrison's three-year absence. He'd just finished Veedon Fleece." [...] Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic and said it is Morrison's most shamelessly cathartic work since Astral Weeks, [...] "soothing, evocative late-night music", but suffers from his long-windedness and a second side highlighted only by [...] "Bulbs".|$|E

But when the danger is over and the calamity has had its day, then there is all too quickly a relapse into the old ways of life, and the reconciliation coerced by the need sometimes carries within itself the seed of a deeper separation than the one that was eliminated.

Her linguistic grasp was secure, and her intonation likewise... Miss Blackwell's personality on the stage is warm and likable, and in one of Roland Hayes's spiritual arrangements she showed an unexpected comic gift." [...] In 1994, the New York Times said, [...] "Her performances at the Met since her 1987 debut as Pousette in [...] "Manon" [...] have won consistent praise, both for the purity and suppleness of her voice and for her poised, persuasive acting." [...] A 2000 article in the Seattle Post Intelligencer in review of her performance of the title role in Lucia di Lammermoor said, [...] "Vocally and dramatically, this is a role that is perfectly suited to Blackwell; the voice is the right size, the right timbre and has the right flexibility for this coloratura challenge. Agile and clear, her soprano soars and floats like an eagle on an updraft. The two big E-flats in the Mad Scene were right on target." [...] In 2001 Opera News said, [...] "Harolyn Blackwell sang beautifully, with crisp, unfussy diction... She sang with a satisfying lyricism, and her [...] "Summertime" [...] was mesmerizing."

He noted that a plague or other disaster would bring people together in a common concern.
