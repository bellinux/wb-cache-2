2500|$|Ideally, the {{underground}} {{part of the}} assembly should reside {{in an area of}} high ground conductivity. If {{the underground}} cable is able to resist corrosion well, it can be covered in salt to improve its electrical connection with the ground. While the electrical resistance of the lightning conductor between the air terminal and the Earth is of significant concern, the inductive reactance of the conductor could be more important. For this reason, the down conductor route is kept short, and any curves have a large radius. If these measures are not taken, lightning current may arc over a resistive or reactive obstruction that it encounters in the conductor. At the very least, the arc current will damage the lightning conductor and can easily find another conductive path, such as building wiring or plumbing, and cause fires or other disasters. Grounding systems without low resistivity to the ground can still be effective in protecting a structure from lightning damage. When ground soil has poor conductivity, is very shallow, or non-existent, a grounding system can be augmented by adding ground rods, counterpoise (<b>ground</b> <b>ring)</b> conductor, cable radials projecting away from the building, or a concrete building's reinforcing bars can be used for a ground conductor (Ufer ground).

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an experimental and numerical {{study of the}} dynamics and structure of an atmospheric-pressure helium discharge with nitrogen admixture propagating through a thin dielectric tube surrounded by two ring electrodes. The experimental unfiltered optical emission of the discharge {{has been compared to}} the computed emission of the second positive system of nitrogen and shows very good agreement. In all studied cases, the discharge ignition occurs inside the tube at the outer edges of the high-voltage electrode ring, and the discharge propagates outward of both sides of the high-voltage ring with a rather homogeneous discharge front structure. When the discharge ap- proaches the <b>grounded</b> <b>ring,</b> the emission is enhanced and moves from the symmetry axis to the tube surface. In both simulation and experiment, an initial front propagation velocity of about 3 × 106 cm/s is observed as the plasma traverses {{the first part of the}} electrode gap. This velocity increases in the later part of the electrode gap as the plasma approaches the <b>grounded</b> <b>ring,</b> and the observed velocity in the experiment is slightly higher than that in the simulation. In experiments, when the admixture is decreased, the discharge constricts close to the tube axis during its propaga- tion between the electrode rings before moving to the tube surface close to the <b>grounded</b> <b>ring.</b> In simulations, as a first step, we have considered that, in reducing the amount of nitrogen admixture, the efficiency of photoionization decreases significantly.
