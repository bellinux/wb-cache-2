25|$|Photomultipliers are {{typically}} constructed with an evacuated glass housing (using an extremely tight and durable glass-to-metal seal like other vacuum tubes), containing a photocathode, several dynodes, and an anode. Incident photons strike the photocathode material, {{which is usually}} a thin vapor-deposited conducting layer {{on the inside of}} the entry window of the device. Electrons are ejected from the surface as a consequence of the photoelectric effect. These electrons are directed by the focusing electrode toward the <b>electron</b> <b>multiplier,</b> where electrons are multiplied by the process of secondary emission.|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{some type}} of <b>electron</b> <b>multiplier</b> is used, though other {{detectors}} including Faraday cups and ion-to-photon detectors are also used. Because the number of ions leaving the mass analyzer at a particular instant is typically quite small, considerable amplification is often necessary to get a signal. Microchannel plate detectors are commonly used in modern commercial instruments. In FTMS and Orbitraps, the detector consists {{of a pair of}} metal surfaces within the mass analyzer/ion trap region which the ions only pass near as they oscillate. No direct current is produced, only a weak AC image current is produced in a circuit between the electrodes. Other inductive detectors have also been used.|$|E
25|$|In {{a typical}} MS procedure, a sample, {{which may be}} solid, liquid, or gas, is ionized, for example by bombarding it with electrons. This may cause some of the sample's {{molecules}} to break into charged fragments. These ions are then separated according to their mass-to-charge ratio, typically by accelerating them and subjecting them to an electric or magnetic field: ions of the same mass-to-charge ratio will undergo {{the same amount of}} deflection. The ions are detected by a mechanism capable of detecting charged particles, such as an <b>electron</b> <b>multiplier.</b> Results are displayed as spectra of the relative abundance of detected ions {{as a function of the}} mass-to-charge ratio. The atoms or molecules in the sample can be identified by correlating known masses to the identified masses or through a characteristic fragmentation pattern.|$|E

40|$|An <b>{{electron}}</b> <b>multiplying</b> CMOS images sensor (emCMOS) enables electron multiplication {{inside the}} pixel {{by the use}} of high voltage (hv) phase(s) under gate(s). Different possible implementations of hv gates dedicated to impact ionization require specific multiplication patterns and therefore new excess noise formulation. This paper presents a rigorous mathematical approach to the calculation of the excess noise factor for all <b>electron</b> <b>multiplying</b> CMOS pixel structures in the framework of the branching processes and the compounding theorem of the probability generating function. Validation of the model is performed by computing the variance formula for one pixel structure and its corresponding Monte Carlo simulation of the stochastic processes.

25|$|FTICR-MS differs {{significantly}} from other mass spectrometry techniques {{in that the}} ions are not detected by hitting a detector such as an <b>electron</b> <b>multiplier</b> but only by passing near detection plates. Additionally the masses are not resolved in space or time as with other techniques but only by the ion cyclotron resonance (rotational) frequency that each ion produces as it rotates in a magnetic field. Thus, the different ions are not detected in different places as with sector instruments or at different times as with time-of-flight instruments, but all ions are detected simultaneously during the detection interval. This provides {{an increase in the}} observed signal-to-noise ratio owing to the principles of Fellgett's advantage. In FTICR-MS, resolution can be improved either by increasing the strength of the magnet (in teslas) or by increasing the detection duration.|$|E

2500|$|Fourier {{transform}} {{mass spectrometry}} (FTMS), {{or more precisely}} Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance MS, measures mass by detecting the image current produced by ions cyclotroning {{in the presence of}} a magnetic field. Instead of measuring the deflection of ions with a detector such as an <b>electron</b> <b>multiplier,</b> the ions are injected into a Penning trap (a static electric/magnetic ion trap) where they effectively form part of a circuit. Detectors at fixed positions in space measure the electrical signal of ions which pass near them over time, producing a periodic signal. Since the frequency of an ion's cycling is determined by its mass-to-charge ratio, this can be deconvoluted by performing a Fourier transform on the signal. FTMS has the advantage of high sensitivity (since each ion is [...] "counted" [...] more than once) and much higher resolution and thus precision.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>electron</b> <b>multiplier</b> {{consists}} {{of a number of}} electrodes called dynodes. Each dynode is held at a more positive potential, by ≈100 Volts, than the preceding one. A primary electron leaves the photocathode with the energy of the incoming photon, or about 3eV for [...] "blue" [...] photons, minus the work function of the photocathode. A small group of primary electrons is created by the arrival of a group of initial photons. (In Fig. 1, the number of primary electrons in the initial group is proportional to the energy of the incident high energy gamma ray.) [...] The primary electrons move toward the first dynode because they are accelerated by the electric field. They each arrive with ≈100eV kinetic energy imparted by the potential difference. Upon striking the first dynode, more low energy electrons are emitted, and these electrons are in turn accelerated toward the second dynode. The geometry of the dynode chain is such that a cascade occurs with an exponentially-increasing number of electrons being produced at each stage. For example, if at each stage an average of 5 new electrons are produced for each incoming electron, and if there are 12 dynode stages, then at the last stage one expects for each primary electron about 512 ≈ 108 electrons. [...] This last stage is called the anode. This large number of electrons reaching the anode results in a sharp current pulse that is easily detectable, for example on an oscilloscope, signaling the arrival of the photon(s) at the photocathode ≈50 nanoseconds earlier.|$|E

40|$|Low {{light level}} and {{high-speed}} image sensors as required for space applications can {{suffer from a}} decrease in the signal to noise ratio (SNR) due to the photon-starved environment and limitations of the sensor’s readout noise. The SNR can be increased by the implementation of Time Delay Integration (TDI) as it allows photoelectrons from multiple exposures to be summed in the charge domain with no added noise. Electron Multiplication (EM) can further improve the SNR and lead to an increase in device performance. However, both techniques have traditionally been confined to Charge Coupled Devices (CCD) due to the efficient charge transfer required. With the increase in demand for CMOS sensors with equivalent or superior functionality and performance, this paper presents findings from the characterisation of a low voltage EMCCD in a CMOS process using advanced design features to increase the <b>electron</b> <b>multiplying</b> gain.
