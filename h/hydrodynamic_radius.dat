5000|$|Dynamic light {{scattering}} (DLS), {{also known as}} quasielastic {{light scattering}} (QELS), or photon correlation spectroscopy, processes the time-dependent fluctuations in scattered light intensity to yield the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>radius</b> of particles in solution. The <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>radius</b> is the radius of a solid sphere with the same translational diffusion coefficient as that measured for the sample particle. As proteins associate, the average <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>radius</b> of the solution increases. Application of the Method of Continuous Variation, otherwise known as the Job plot, with the solution <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>radius</b> as the observable, enables in vitro determination of Kd, complex stoichiometry, complex <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>radius,</b> and the ΔH° and ΔS° of protein-protein interactions. This technique does not entail immobilization or labeling. Transient and weak interactions can be characterized. Relative to static light scattering, which {{is based upon the}} absolute intensity of scattered light, DLS is insensitive to background light from the walls of containing structures. This insensitivity permits DLS measurements from 1 µL volumes in 1536 well plates, and lowers sample requirements into the femtomole range. This technique is also suitable for screening of buffer components and/or small molecule inhibitors/effectors.|$|E

50|$|Some of {{the most}} {{interesting}} characteristics exhibited by star-shaped polymers are their unique rheological and dynamic properties compared to linear analogues of identical molecular weight and monomer composition. Generally, they have smaller <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>radii,</b> radii of gyration and lower internal viscosities than linear analogues of the same molecular weight. Internal viscosity increases with increased functionality and molecular weight of branches with the effects of functionality eventually saturating, leaving viscosity dependent only on molecular weight of the arms. Miktoarm stars have observed viscosities and <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>radii</b> higher than homostars. This is due to the increased repulsive interactions that occur {{as a result of a}} greater number of heterocontacts between the different arms.

The self-diffusion coefficient of disaccharide (D) and the apparent diffusion coefficient D-app have been obtained {{as a function of}} disaccharide weight fraction c and temperature (20 - 60 degreesC). <b>Hydrodynamic</b> <b>radii</b> at infinite dilution have been evaluated. In case of trehalose and sucrose a model of monodisperse hard spheres has been used to interpret the concentration dependence of D and D-app in the dilute region (c {{less than or equal to}} 0. 1), thus obtaining the values of the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>radii</b> together with the diffusing particles volume fractions as a function of c and T. The invariance of the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>radii</b> and the agreement with the model suggest that T and c neither induce self-aggregation of the sugars nor affect sensitively their structure and hydration. The self-diffusion coefficient of D 2 O (D-s) at 20 degreesC has also been measured for the DO solutions of the three sugars. By following an interpretation commonly used to rationalize the self-diffusion coefficient of small molecules in colloidal systems, obstruction and hydration of disaccharide have been invoked to explain the decrease of D, as a function of c.

The apparent molecular weights, distribution functions of radii, and diffusion coefficients were determined from the autocorrelation function of the scattered light. In the heptane-AOT-water system it was found that at constant temperature and constant AOT concentration the total interfacial area was independent of the water volume over a fairly large range. The polydispersity and the average <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>radii</b> increased with temperature and disperse-phase volume for the W/O microemulsions. The average droplet radius ranged from 60 to 3000 A. The behavior of the O/W microemulsions was found to be more complex. In most of the 11 systems studied the distribution functions were bimodal, indicating the presence of surfactant micelles in equilibrium with microemulsion droplets. The apparent molecular weights determined from intensity measurements and from the average <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>radii</b> agree well for the heptane-AOT-water systems but the agreement is not good for the other systems...|$|R
40|$|Microscopic semiflexible {{filaments}} {{suspended in}} a viscous fluid are widely encountered in biophysical problems. The classic {{example is the}} flagella used by microorganisms to generate propulsion. Simulating the dynamics of these filaments numerically is complicated because of the coupling between {{the motion of the}} filament and that of the surrounding fluid. An attractive idea is to simplify this coupling by modeling the fluid motion by using Stokeslets distributed at equal intervals along the model filament. We show that, with an appropriate choice of the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>radii,</b> one can recover accurate hydrodynamic behavior of a filament with a finite cross section without requiring an explicit surface. This is true, however, only if the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>radii</b> take specific values and that they differ in the parallel and perpendicular directions leading to a caterpillarlike hydrodynamic shape.

40|$|A {{transition}} from micelles to vesicles is reported when salts {{are added to}} a catanionic micellar soln. composed of Na dodecylcarboxylate (SL) and dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB), with an excess of SL. The counterion binding and increase in aggregate size was monitored by mass spectrometry, rheol. and dynamic light scattering measurements, whereas the vesicles were characterized by freeze-fracture and cryo-transmission microscopy expts. The effect of counterions on the formation of vesicles was studied and compared to a previously studied catanionic system with a sulfate head group, SDS/DTAB.

40|$|Thermal {{treatment}} of protein–polysaccharide complexes will form nanogel particles, wherein the polysaccharide controls nanogel formation by limiting protein aggregation. To determine {{the impact of}} the chitosan molecular weight and non-interactive chains on the formation of nanogels, mixtures of α-lactalbumin were prepared with selectively-hydrolyzed chitosan containing covalently-attached polyethylene glycol chains (PEG) and heated near the protein’s isoelectric point to induce formation of nanogels. Turbidity of heated mixtures indicated the formation of suspended aggregates, with greater values observed at higher pH, without attached PEG, and among samples with 8. 9 kDa chitosan. Mixtures containing 113 kDa chitosan-PEG formed precipitating aggregates above pH 5, coinciding with a low-magnitude colloidal charge and average <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>radii</b> > 400 nm. All other tested mixtures were stable to precipitation and possessed average <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>radii</b> ~ 100 nm, with atomic force microscopy showing homogeneous distributions of spherical nanogel aggregates. Over all of the tested conditions, attached PEG led to no additional significant changes in the size or morphology of nanogels formed from the protein and chitosan.

40|$|Observing {{the optical}} {{cross-section}} and electron micrographs of mechanically skinned fibres of frog skeletal muscle, {{we found that}} ethylene glycols (EGs) of small (mono-, di-, tri- and tetra-EGs; Mr 62 – 194) and medium (poly-EGs; Mr 900 and 3350) molecular weights efficiently dehydrate the fibres to shrink them radially without microscopic inhomogeneity. The medium-sized poly-EGs at 30 % weight/ weight concentration absorbed almost all the evaporable water from the fibre. Passive tension measurement at near slack sarcomere spacing indicated that this dehydration by EGs did not accompany longitudinal fibre shrinkage. Chemically relevant fully hydric alcohols (glycerol, threitol, ribitol and mannitol; Mr 92 – 182) showed no appreciable dehydrating ability on fibres. An intimate correlation was found between fibre dehydration and CH 2 -concentration of the solutions. Viscosity measurements indicated that the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>radii</b> of the alcohols were compa-rable {{to those of the}} small EGs. Therefore, <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>radii</b> are not a primary determinant of the dehydrating ability. Additionally, CH 2 -concentration of EGs but not alcohols was found to correlate intimately with the measured viscosity of the bulk solution of EGs. These results suggested that the interaction between water molecules and CH 2 -units in crowded cytoplasm of skeletal muscle affects cytoplasm as a whole to realize anisotropic fibre shrinkage...|$|R
