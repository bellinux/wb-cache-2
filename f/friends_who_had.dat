5|$|Emigration {{of young}} people {{continued}} apace with 400,000 Scots, ten per cent of the population, estimated to have left the country between 1921 and 1931. The economic stagnation was only one factor; other push factors included a zest for travel and adventure, and the pull factors of better job opportunities abroad, personal networks to link into, and the basic cultural similarity of the United States, Canada, and Australia. Government subsidies for travel and relocation facilitated the decision to emigrate. Personal networks of family and <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> gone ahead and wrote back, or sent money, prompted emigrants to follow.|$|E
5|$|In 1787, 1789, and 1790, Dissenters again {{tried to}} repeal the Test and Corporation Acts. Although {{initially}} {{it looked as if}} they might succeed, by 1790, with the fears of revolution looming in Parliament, few were swayed by appeals to equal rights. Political cartoons, {{one of the most effective}} and popular media of the time, skewered the Dissenters and Priestley. In Parliament, William Pitt and Edmund Burke argued against the repeal, a betrayal that angered Priestley and his <b>friends,</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> expected the two men's support. Priestley wrote a series of Letters to William Pitt and Letters to Burke in an attempt to persuade them otherwise, but these publications only further inflamed the populace against him.|$|E
5|$|Similar to Tangled, Frozen {{employed}} a unique artistic style by blending together features of both computer-generated imagery (CGI) and traditional hand-drawn animation. From the beginning, Buck knew Giaimo {{was the best}} candidate to develop the style he had in mind– which would draw from the best Disney hand-drawn classics of the 1950s, the Disney Little Golden Books, and mid-century modern design– and persuaded {{him to come back}} to Disney to serve as the art director for Frozen. Buck, Lasseter, and Giaimo were all old <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> first met at the California Institute of the Arts, and Giaimo had previously served as the art director for Disney's Pocahontas (1995), which Buck had worked on as a supervising animator.|$|E

5|$|At 2pm {{on the day}} of announcement, a {{crowd of}} about 100 journalists, supporters, and <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> {{gathered}} outside the main entrance to the Beijing housing estate where the Lius resided were denied entry. The South China Morning Post reported that policemen stationed inside their apartment {{at the time of the}} announcement prevented Liu Xia from meeting with journalists and other well-wishers. It was not immediately clear whether Liu Xiaobo was aware of the award. By that time, Liu Xia said she had been told she would be taken to Liaoning to see her husband in prison. Meetings and gatherings to celebrate in several cities were prevented or abruptly broken up by police; one such celebration dinner in Beijing, attended by 20 people, was broken up by police, and the attendees were detained.|$|E
5|$|During this visit, Parry and his <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> {{accompanied}} him to Wales travelled the country giving concerts of Parry's own works. They were well received throughout the land. Parry {{was offered the}} opportunity to study for a year under Dr Davies of Swansea, followed by a one-year scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music. He had to refuse both offers since he had a wife and child in the United States dependent on him for support. By 1865, Parry's musical ability had become well known in Wales and in the United States. A fund was established to support Parry and his family while he studied music; donations were received from both countries. Parry aided his own cause by giving concerts in Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Having {{resolved}} {{to explore the}} island of Rasay, which could be done only on foot, I last night obtained my fellow-traveller’s permission to leave him for a day, he being unable to take so hardy a walk. Old Mr Malcolm M’Cleod, who had obligingly promised to accompany me, was at my bedside between five and six. I sprang up immediately, and he and I, attended by two other gentlemen, traversed the country during the whole of this day. Though we had passed over not less than four-and-twenty miles of very rugged ground, and had a Highland dance {{on the top of}} Dùn Can, the highest mountain in the island, we returned in the evening not at all fatigued, and piqued ourselves at not being outdone at the nightly ball by our less active <b>friends,</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> remained at home.|$|E

25|$|Located 401 East Ninth Street in Winfield, Kansas.

The project quickly grew from honoring only Cowley County servicemen to representing all 777 servicemen and nurses from Kansas who lost their lives or are missing in action from the Vietnam War.|$|E

25|$|Aiken's {{continuing}} bitterness towards Blythe was {{in contrast}} with the cross-party friendship which had developed between their colleagues Seán MacEntee (anti-treaty) and Desmond FitzGerald (pro-treaty) who, after the divide, re-established relationships and ensured their children held no civil war bitterness. The great rivals Éamon de Valera and W. T. Cosgrave, after years of enmity, also became reconciled in the 1960s. However Aiken refused to reconcile with former <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> taken sides in the Civil War.|$|E
25|$|In June 2015, Jurvetson's older sister, Anne, was {{contacted}} by <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been searching through the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, {{and who had}} noticed a similarity between a contemporary morgue photograph of the then-unidentified woman and Anne Jurvetson's estranged sister. In response to the notification, Anne submitted a DNA sample for comparison to a sample retrieved from a bloodstained bra belonging to the deceased which had been retained and stored, and from which the DNA had been obtained.|$|E
25|$|There is no single, undisputed {{official}} {{version of}} Truth's speech. Robinson and Truth were <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> worked together concerning both abolition {{of slavery and}} women's rights, and his report is strictly his recollection with no added commentary. Since Robinson's version {{was published in the}} Anti-Slavery Bugle, the audience is largely concerned with the rights of African Americans rather than women; it is possible Robinson's version is framed for his audience. Although Truth collaborated with Robinson on the transcription of her speech, Truth did not dictate his writing word for word.|$|E

25|$|The {{race was}} {{initially}} {{planned to be}} a cruise by Peter Luke and some <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> formed a club for those who enjoyed cruising as opposed to racing, however when a visiting British Royal Navy Officer, Captain John Illingworth, suggested it be made a race, the event was born. The Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race has grown over the decades, since the inaugural race in 1945, {{to become one of}} the top three offshore yacht races in the world, and it now attracts maxi yachts from all around the globe. The 2004 race marked the 60th running of the event.|$|E
25|$|On August 20, 1928, Wedge, who was despondent due to {{the death}} of Prudence in May, his unemployment, and {{financial}} problems, was prevented from committing suicide in his apartment at 2261 Shattuck Avenue, Berkeley, by <b>friends</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> received his farewell letters. Wedge wrote a letter of resignation from the Presbyterian church where he held his minister's credentials so that he would not die as a clergyman. Wedge was committed to the psychiatric ward of the Highlands Hospital for several days of observation after a petition by his friend, Rev. Miles B. Davis, pastor of the First Congregational Church in Berkeley.|$|E
25|$|The Apparition did {{not speak}} until the third appearance, and {{therefore}} its identity {{was a matter of}} considerable speculation. Pious villagers Jeanne-Marie Milhet and Antoinette Peyret, on hearing Soubirous' description of the apparition, thought it was the returning spirit of one of their <b>friends,</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> died a few months before. Although not part of Catholic doctrine, the concept of the revenant was deeply rooted in Pyrenean superstition. According to tradition, revenants rarely spoke, but communicated their messages in writing, and so Milhet and Peyret furnished Soubirous with paper, a pen, and an inkpot to take with her, in case the apparition should make use of them.|$|E
