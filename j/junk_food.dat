5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) {{predicts that}} {{overweight}} and obesity may soon replace more traditional public health concerns such as undernutrition {{and infectious diseases}} as the most significant cause of poor health. Obesity is a public health and policy problem because of its prevalence, costs, and health effects. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for all adults followed by behavioral interventions in those who are obese. Public health efforts seek to understand and correct the environmental factors responsible for the increasing prevalence of obesity in the population. Solutions look at changing the factors that cause excess food energy consumption and inhibit physical activity. Efforts include federally reimbursed meal programs in schools, limiting direct <b>junk</b> <b>food</b> marketing to children, and decreasing access to sugar-sweetened beverages in schools. The World Health Organization recommends the taxing of sugary drinks. When constructing urban environments, efforts {{have been made to}} increase access to parks and to develop pedestrian routes.|$|E
40|$|Background: Low {{attention}} to dairy product consumptions and high intake of <b>junk</b> <b>foods</b> and bakery products might {{be related to}} high prevalence of chronic diseases because of their fat content and fatty acid composition. Objective: In this study we investigated the kind and amount of fatty acid content in Iranian <b>junk</b> <b>foods,</b> dairy, and bakery products Materials and Methods: Some common brands of Iranian′s <b>junk</b> <b>foods,</b> dairy, and bakery products were chosen randomly from different supermarkets in Iran. The amount of 10 g sample was considered for fatty acid analysis by gas chromatography equipment with flam ionization detector. Results: In this study stearic acid (C 18 : 0) and palmitic (C 16 : 0) acid have the highest amount among other saturated fatty acids in all groups. In <b>junk</b> <b>foods</b> and bakery products, the most common trans-fatty acid (TFA) is elaidic acid (C 18 : 1 9 t) with ranging from 2. 4 % to 18. 5 % and in dairy products vaccinic acid (C 18 : 1 11 t) has the high level of TFAs among others (2. 1 % to 11. 5 %).

Factor analysis was used to identify major dietary patterns in this Turkish population. Results: We identified 6 major dietary patterns: (1) Western pattern high in pizza, meats and fruit juice; (2) Sweat <b>junk</b> <b>foods</b> pattern high in dried fruits, jams, honey and sugar; (3) Asian pattern high in legumes, potato and other vegetables; (4) Salty <b>junk</b> <b>foods</b> pattern high in carrot, puffs and potato chips and (6) Iranian traditional dietary pattern high in hydrogenated fats, garlic and broth.

25|$|This {{mismatch}} {{also shows}} up in the phenomena of the supernormal stimulus, a stimulus that elicits a response more strongly than the stimulus for which the response evolved. The term was coined by Niko Tinbergen to refer to non-human animal behavior, but psychologist Deirdre Barrett said that supernormal stimulation governs the behavior of humans as powerfully as that of other animals. She explained <b>junk</b> <b>food</b> as an exaggerated stimulus to cravings for salt, sugar, and fats, and she says that television is an exaggeration of social cues of laughter, smiling faces and attention-grabbing action. Magazine centerfolds and double cheeseburgers pull instincts intended for an EEA where breast development was a sign of health, youth and fertility in a prospective mate, and fat was a rare and vital nutrient. The psychologist Mark van Vugt recently argued that modern organizational leadership is a mismatch. His argument is that humans are not adapted to work in large, anonymous bureaucratic structures with formal hierarchies. The human mind still responds to personalized, charismatic leadership primarily in the context of informal, egalitarian settings. Hence the dissatisfaction and alienation that many employees experience. Salaries, bonuses and other privileges exploit instincts for relative status, which attract particularly males to senior executive positions.|$|E
