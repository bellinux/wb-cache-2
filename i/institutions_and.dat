30|$|The above studies {{reveal a}} picture of how <b>institution</b> <b>and</b> culture work {{together}} to influence social behaviors. However, {{in the context of}} social changes, <b>institution</b> <b>and</b> culture are constantly changing as well, and therefore, studying the impact of <b>institution</b> <b>and</b> culture on social behavior based only on a time cross section is not sufficient to understand the constitutive relationship of culture <b>and</b> <b>institution</b> <b>and</b> the richness and diversity of their mutual effect. This paper will examine the impact on female fertility decision-making as a result of constantly adjusting the birth control <b>institution</b> <b>and</b> changing culture since the implementation of China’s family planning policy in 1978 and following a timeline of nearly 40  years. This paper also chooses to examine the fertility decision because two norms create a conflict, that is, the traditional son preference fertility cultural norms and the family planning policy that aim to control the population. Studying which norm has a more profound and lasting effect for different communities’ contexts will contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the interaction between culture <b>and</b> <b>institution</b> <b>and</b> how they affect individual behavior during times of social change.|$|R
