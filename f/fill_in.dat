5|$|The Killers {{released}} a statement on August 28, 2017 confirming that both Mark Stoermer and Dave Keuning would not be touring with the band during their upcoming Wonderful Wonderful World Tour, while reiterating that both are still members of the band. Jake Blanton will continue to <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> for Stoermer while touring guitarist Ted Sablay will <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> for Keuning.|$|E
5|$|The {{band has}} also seen musicians such as Keith Morris and Chuck Biscuits briefly <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> {{for a show}} or two. Morris, who was {{fronting}} the Circle Jerks at the time, filled in for Kiedis for a show in 1986. Kiedis was off scoring drugs and missed the band's performance so they asked Morris to <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> however Morris didn't {{know any of the}} lyrics to the songs so he screamed and yelled his way through the show. Drummer Chuck Biscuits also briefly filled in on drums back in 1986.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} twentieth century {{scientists}} had come to believe that cells are surrounded by a thin oil-like barrier, but the structural nature of this membrane was not known. Two experiments in 1925 laid the groundwork to <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> this gap. By measuring the capacitance of erythrocyte solutions, Hugo Fricke determined that the cell membrane was 3.3nm thick.|$|E

5|$|Georgie Henley as Lucy Pevensie. Henley {{acknowledged}} Lucy represents {{faith in}} the story, being the youngest and therefore most open-minded of the Pevensies. During filming, Henley's baby teeth were falling out, so she wore fake teeth to <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> the gaps.|$|E
5|$|In {{the gold}} rush of 1893, miners in Kalgoorlie {{discarded}} a pyritic material as they searched for pure gold, and {{it was used to}} <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> potholes and build sidewalks. In 1896, that tailing was discovered to be calaverite, a telluride of gold, and it sparked a second gold rush that included mining the streets.|$|E
5|$|Vegetation {{clearing}} and cattle trampling river banks create severe siltation, which <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> pools, degrade river ecosystems and make {{rivers and streams}} uninhabitable for Murray cod. This is exacerbated by removal of riparian (riverbank) vegetation which causes siltation and degrades river ecosystems in many ways.|$|E

5|$|A railway from Grantham to Sleaford {{opened in}} 1857. This was {{extended}} to Boston in 1859, and so offered direct competition to the navigation. The decline was rapid. Income fell from £981 in 1858 to £168 in 1868, and the share price dropped from £40 to £10 between 1860 and 1863. The company was trading at a loss by 1871, and although an Act of Abandonment was obtained on 17 June 1878, the navigation did not actually close until 14 May 1881, which was also {{the date of the}} final meeting of the proprietors. The Act required the company to <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> the three locks nearest to Sleaford, but there were special provisions for the remaining structures. The next three were on a stretch of river bordered by land belonging to Haverholme Priory, and were to be put into good order and handed over to Murray Finch Hatton, earl of Winchilsea & Nottingham, who owned the Priory. He could then maintain or abandon them, but was required to construct sluices if he chose to abandon them. The final lock was to be handed over to the commissioners of the River Witham, once it was in good order, and they could remove the gates and <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> the lock if they chose to do so.|$|E
5|$|A roadway {{was present}} along parts of today's H-58 {{by the late}} 1920s; initially, this county road was gravel or earth between Munising and Kingston Corners and {{connected}} with other roads to Grand Marais. In the 1930s, another segment was built to connect to Deer Park and to <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> the gap between Kingston Corners and Grand Marais. The southwestern segment between Munising and Van Meer formed part of M-94 from 1929 until it was transferred back to county control in the early 1960s.|$|E

When Exodus also toured in the summer of 2012, guitarist Rick Hunolt (who left Exodus <b>in</b> 2005) <b>filled</b> <b>in</b> for Holt. Cannibal Corpse guitarist Pat O'Brien also <b>filled</b> <b>in</b> for Holt during this time.|$|R
40|$|The term ‘filling in’ was {{developed}} in the context of research into UK devolution in order to move beyond the literature on the ‘hollowing out’ of the national state. We critically unpack the concept of <b>filling</b> <b>in</b> and assess its value, identifying three main ambiguities. First, we emphasise the need to distinguish between what we term structural and relational forms of <b>filling</b> <b>in,</b> ensuring a clear analytical separation between structure and agency. Second, we examine the associated scalar politics of devolution, arguing that <b>filling</b> <b>in</b> and hollowing out are not scale-specific processes. Third, we distinguish between <b>filling</b> <b>in</b> as originally advanced, which is time-specific in relation to the process of devolution, and ‘pure’ forms of <b>filling</b> <b>in</b> which can be seen as time-neutral. <b>In</b> abstracting <b>filling</b> <b>in</b> from the context of devolution in this way, our purpose is to render it capable of wider application to the study of other processes of state restructuring...|$|R
5|$|According to {{his book}} Doctor Who: The Companions (published {{at about the}} time The Trial of a Time Lord was broadcast), series {{producer}} John Nathan-Turner intended to chronicle the Doctor's first meeting with Melanie Bush in a later episode. The subsequent dismissal of Colin Baker from {{the role of the}} Doctor rendered this potential storyline moot, although the later novel Business Unusual by Gary Russell, that was published in September 1997, would attempt to <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> this gap in the show's continuity.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, for an implant to look esthetic, {{a band of}} full, plump gingiva {{is needed}} to <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> the space {{on either side of}} implant. The most common soft tissue {{complication}} is called a black-triangle, where the papilla (the small triangular piece of tissue between two teeth) shrinks back and leaves a triangular void between the implant and the adjacent teeth. Dentists can only expect 2–4mm of papilla height over the underlying bone. A black triangle can be expected if the distance between where the teeth touch and bone is any greater.|$|E
5|$|At the park's visitor center, {{the group}} learns that the cloning was {{accomplished}} by extracting dinosaur DNA from mosquitoes that had been preserved in amber. DNA from frogs was used to <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> gaps in the dinosaur genomes. To prevent breeding, all the dinosaurs were made female. Malcolm scoffs {{at the idea of}} such controlled breeding, declaring it will inevitably break down. The crew witness the birth of a baby raptor and visit the raptor enclosure. During a luncheon, the group debates the ethics of cloning and the creation of the park, with Dr. Malcolm giving a harsh warning about the implications of genetic engineering as a whole.|$|E

50|$|Tile Paint {{is another}} type of picture logic puzzle by Nikoli. It works like regular nonograms except that it only {{specifies}} {{the total number of}} squares in each row or column that will be <b>filled</b> <b>in</b> and irregular sections within the grid have borders around them that indicate that, if one of the squares within it is <b>filled</b> <b>in,</b> all of them must be <b>filled</b> <b>in.</b>|$|R
5|$|Between 1631 and 1890, {{the city}} tripled its area through land {{reclamation}} by filling in marshes, mud flats, and gaps between wharves along the waterfront. The largest reclamation efforts {{took place during}} the 19th century; beginning in 1807, the crown of Beacon Hill was used to <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> a 50-acre (20ha) mill pond that later became the Haymarket Square area. The present-day State House sits atop this lowered Beacon Hill. Reclamation projects {{in the middle of the}} century created significant parts of the South End, the West End, the Financial District, and Chinatown.|$|E
5|$|Contested by twelve {{national}} teams, {{the tournament}} had Zambia invited {{as a guest}} nation to <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> for Djibouti, who failed to participate for a second consecutive year.

5|$|Cope's and Marsh's discoveries were {{accompanied}} by sensational accusations of spying, stealing workers and fossils, and bribery. The two men were so protective of their digging sites that they would destroy smaller or damaged fossils {{to prevent them from}} falling into their rival's hands, or <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> their excavations with dirt and rock; while surveying his Como quarries in 1879, Marsh examined recent finds and marked several for destruction. On one occasion the scientists' rival teams fought each other by throwing stones.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the smaller}} south end docks were closed in 1971 with Brunswick Dock {{remaining}} until closure in 1975. Many docks have been <b>filled</b> <b>in</b> to create land for buildings: at the Pier Head, an arena at Kings Dock, commercial estates at Toxteth and Harrington Docks and housing at Herculaneum Dock. In the north, some branch docks have been <b>filled</b> <b>in</b> to create land. Sandon and Wellington Docks have been <b>filled</b> <b>in</b> and are now {{the location of a}} sewage works.

5|$|During the 1960–61 season, Crozier {{spent the}} {{majority}} of his time in the OHA-Jr. Due to his small frame and size, Crozier was not a favourite with either scouts or critics. Despite this, the Buffalo Bisons of the American Hockey League (AHL) recruited Crozier to <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> for their injured starting goaltender, Denis DeJordy that same season. Appearing in three games, Crozier recorded two wins and a 2.31 goals against average (GAA). Crozier returned as the starting goaltender for the Teepees for the 1961–62 season. He also had short stints with the Sault Ste. Marie Thunderbirds of the Eastern Professional Hockey League (EPHL), and the Bisons.|$|E
5|$|Etty {{generally}} finished life studies {{during three}} evenings sittings. On the first evening he would sketch {{the model in}} charcoal or chalk, and then ink in the outline. On the second he used oil paints to <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> the figures. On the third he layered glaze and the final coverings of paint. He usually painted on millboard, re-using the reverse for fresh paintings. His female models were typically shop-girls, prostitutes, actresses or poses plastiques models, while his male models tended to be Life Guards recruited from the nearby barracks, who he thought to have an appropriate muscular physique, or occasionally men Etty met in public bath houses.|$|E
