5000|$|A {{hole saw}} (also styled <b>holesaw),</b> {{also known as}} a hole cutter, is a saw blade of [...] (ring) shape, whose annular [...] creates a hole in the {{workpiece}} without having to cut up the core material. It is used in a drill. Hole saws typically have a pilot drill bit at their center to keep the saw teeth from walking. The fact that a hole saw creates the hole without needing to cut up the core often makes it preferable to twist drills or spade drills for relatively large holes (especially those larger than 25 mm). The same hole can be made faster and using less power.|$|E

However, {{the same is}} not true for multi-point cutting tools. The paper examines the progress made in low-value high-volume (bandsaws, <b>holesaws)</b> and high-value low-volume (circular saws, broach tools) products. Whilst some successes are reported there are some continuing disappointments in tool life improvement and performance owing {{to the lack of}} systems approach. The author gives examples of products and has identified parameters and processes which tool manufacturers and coaters should jointly address to fully exploit the advantages of surface engineering technologies. The paper should prove useful and be of interest to material suppliers, tool manufacturers and surface coaters...|$|R

The {{benefits}} of applying advanced coatings on both single point and multipoint cutting {{tools such as}} improvement of productivity, tool life, machined surface quality etc. have been realised by the surface engineering researchers [1], commercial coaters [2 - 4] and end users [5]. The demand for advanced coatings in cutting tool industries is continually growing {{to meet the challenges}} of high speed machining, dry machining, near net-shape machining, machining of hard-to-cut materials etc [...] Advanced coatings with excellent properties on flat coupon in a laboratory deposited by modern deposition technologies should not be taken for granted in improving the performance of complex shaped cutting tools [6] in aggressive cutting environments. This is because the end performance of coated cutting tools is not only dependant on the coating itself but also on the tool substrate material, geometry, surface finish and cutting edge conditions prior to coating deposition. The paper presents case studies with examples of successes and failures of advanced coatings on different multipoint cutting tools (e. g., milling cutters, bandsaws, circular saws, <b>holesaws</b> etc.). The future strategy for developing successful coating technology for cutting tools should be directed towards adopting a systems approach to bridge the communication gap amongst the cutting tool manufactures, tool coaters and end users...|$|R
