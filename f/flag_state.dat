5|$|International law {{requires}} that every merchant ship be registered in a country. The country in which a ship is registered is its <b>flag</b> <b>state,</b> and the <b>flag</b> <b>state</b> gives the ship the right to fly its civil ensign. A ship's <b>flag</b> <b>state</b> exercises regulatory control over the vessel and is required to inspect it regularly, certify the ship's equipment and crew, and issue safety and pollution prevention documents. A ship operates under the laws of its <b>flag</b> <b>state,</b> and these laws are used if the ship is involved in an admiralty case. The organization which actually registers the ship is known as its registry. Registries may be governmental or private agencies.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of common threads found in criticisms of the flag of {{convenience}} system. One is that these flag states have insufficient regulations and that those regulations they do have are poorly enforced. Another is that, in many cases, the <b>flag</b> <b>state</b> cannot identify a shipowner, much less hold the owner civilly or criminally responsible for a ship's actions. As a result of this lack of <b>flag</b> <b>state</b> control, flags of convenience are criticized on grounds of providing an environment for conducting criminal activities, supporting terrorism, providing poor working conditions for seafarers, and having an adverse effect on the environment.|$|E
5|$|The rules {{regarding}} the correct methods {{to display the}} <b>flag</b> <b>state</b> that when two flags are fully spread out horizontally on a wall behind a podium, their hoists should be towards each other with the saffron stripes uppermost. If the flag is displayed on a short flagpole, this should be mounted {{at an angle to}} the wall with the flag draped tastefully from it. If two national flags are displayed on crossed staffs, the hoists must be towards each other and the flags must be fully spread out. The flag should never be used as a cloth to cover tables, lecterns, podiums or buildings, or be draped from railings.|$|E

Six Annexes of the Convention cover the various sources of pollution from ships and provide an overarching framework for international objectives. In the U.S., the Convention is implemented through the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships. Under the provisions of the Convention, the United States can take direct enforcement action under U.S. laws against foreign-flagged ships when pollution discharge incidents occur within U.S. jurisdiction. When incidents occur outside U.S. jurisdiction or jurisdiction cannot be determined, the United States refers cases to <b>flag</b> <b>states,</b> in accordance with MARPOL. These procedures require substantial coordination between the Coast Guard, the State Department, and other <b>flag</b> <b>states,</b> and the response rate from <b>flag</b> <b>states</b> has been poor.|$|R

Using frequent periodic communications among the fisheries enforcement agencies of its members, ENFO coordinates information on patrol schedules and joint ship patrols, personnel exchanges, <b>flag</b> <b>State</b> enforcement and port State inspection actions, and on unauthorized fishing activities conducted by vessels without nationality operating in the Convention Area.|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "flag of convenience" [...] {{has been}} in use since the 1950s, and {{it refers to the}} civil ensign a ship flies in order to {{indicate}} its country of registration or <b>flag</b> <b>state.</b> A ship operates under the laws of its <b>flag</b> <b>state,</b> and these laws are used if the ship is involved in a case under admiralty law.|$|E

As of 2007, the United States Central Intelligence Agency statistics count 4,295oil tankers of [...] or greater worldwide. Panama was the world's largest <b>flag</b> <b>state</b> for oil tankers, with 528 of the vessels in its registry. Six other flag states had more than 200 registered oil tankers: Liberia (464), Singapore (355), China (252), Russia (250), the Marshall Islands (234) and the Bahamas (209). The Panamanian, Liberian, Marshallese and Bahamian flags are open registries and considered by the International Transport Workers' Federation to be flags of convenience. By comparison, the United States and the United Kingdom only had 59 and 27 registered oil tankers, respectively.|$|E

500|$|The {{principle}} {{that there be}} a genuine link between a ship's owners and its <b>flag</b> <b>state</b> dates back to 1958, when Article 5(1) of the Geneva Convention on the High Seas also required that [...] "the state must effectively exercise its jurisdiction and control in administrative, technical and social matters over ships flying its flag." [...] The principle was repeated in Article 91 of the 1982 treaty called the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and often referred to as UNCLOS. In 1986, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development attempted to solidify the genuine link concept in the United Nations Convention for Registration of Ships. The Convention for Registration of Ships would require that a <b>flag</b> <b>state</b> be linked to its ships either by having an economic stake in the ownership of its ships or by providing mariners to crew the ships. To come into force, the 1986 treaty requires 40 signatories whose combined tonnage exceeds 25% of the world total. , only 14 countries have signed the treaty.|$|E

Of these, all 34 flag of convenience countries listed by ITF have ratified the STCW Convention, concerning standards of training, certification and watchkeeping for seafarers, and 25 of them have now ratified all six. However, nine listed countries have not ratified all the remaining five conventions. To put this in context, 64 flag states have not ratified all six conventions, including China and United States of America.|$|E

[...] the list includes Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bermuda, Bolivia, Burma, Cambodia, the Cayman Island, Comoros, Cyprus, Equatorial Guinea, Georgia, Gibraltar, Honduras, Jamaica, Lebanon, Liberia, Malta, the Marshall Islands, Mauritius, Mongolia, Netherlands Antilles, North Korea, Panama, Sao Tome and Príncipe, St Vincent, Sri Lanka, Tonga, Vanuatu, and the French and German International Ship Registers.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{difficulties}} in implementing MARPOL arises from the very international nature of maritime shipping. The country that the ship visits can conduct its own examination to verify a ship's compliance with international standards and can detain the ship if it finds significant noncompliance. When incidents occur outside such country's jurisdiction or jurisdiction cannot be determined, the country refers cases to <b>flag</b> <b>states,</b> in accordance with MARPOL. A 2000 US GAO report documented that even when referrals have been made, the response rate from <b>flag</b> <b>states</b> has been poor.|$|R

500|$|Actual owners may {{establish}} shell {{corporations to}} be the legal owners of their ships, making it difficult, if not impossible, to track who is the beneficial owner of the ship. The 2004 Report of the UN Secretary General’s Consultative Group on <b>Flag</b> <b>State</b> Implementation reported that [...] "It is very easy, and comparatively inexpensive, to establish a complex web of corporate entities to provide very effective cover to the identities of beneficial owners {{who do not want}} to be known." [...] According to a 2003 report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development report entitled [...] "Ownership and Control of Ships", these corporate structures are often multi-layered, spread across numerous jurisdictions, and make the beneficial owner [...] "almost impenetrable" [...] to law enforcement officials and taxation. The report concludes that [...] "regardless of the reasons why the cloak of anonymity is made available, if it is provided it will also assist those who may wish to remain hidden because they engage in illegal or criminal activities, including terrorists." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ships that {{comply with}} the Convention will receive and are duly {{required}} to carry an international ballast water management certificate.
