40|$|In 1999, Li and Reeves {{presented}} the so-called MCDEA (Multiple Criteria Data Envelopment Analysis) model. This model {{is in fact}} a three objective linear model. It may be used to improve the discriminatory power of the DEA models, as well as generate a more reasonable distribution of the inputs and outputs weights. Besides the classical optimization of the efficiency index, Li and Reeves introduced two other objective functions, called minisum and minimax. Despite of being an important approach, it does not provide benchmarks or targets for inefficient DMUs. Benchmarks and targets {{are one of the most}} important DEA features and in standard DEA are determined using the <b>dual</b> (<b>envelope)</b> model. In this paper, we introduce an approach of the MCDEA dual formulation taking into account only two objective functions at each time. Combining both partial models we suggest benchmarks for each inefficient DMU...|$|E
40|$|A summary is {{presented}} {{of the work}} conducted to quantify the construction cost differences for two types of commercial buildings, heated with either electric resistance or gas and constructed {{in accordance with the}} ASHRAE Standard 90. 1 - 1989 and its proposed revision of March 1996. This first public review draft of the ""Energy Code for Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings"" contained separate envelope criteria for electric-resistance-heated-buildings and buildings heated by other means (<b>dual</b> <b>envelope</b> criteria). The more stringent criteria for the former were justified by the cognizant ASHRAE committee on the basis of rigorous life cycle cost analyses based on national average costs for electricity and natural gas. The two types of buildings analyzed were a two-story office and a one-story retail distribution center. The series of analyses investigated a total of 32 alternatives represented by the combinations of the two building types, two design standards, two types of heating systems, and four climates (Minneapolis, Chicago, New York City, and Oklahoma City). The results showed that the total initial construction cost change is not very large (in the range of - 1 % to + 2 %) when compared to the total cost of construction. The brief report is accompanied by five appendixes (called ""enclosures"") containing the analytical data. "...|$|E

40|$|Plants {{have evolved}} complex and {{sophisticated}} molecular mechanisms to regulate their development and adapt to their surrounding environment. Particularly {{the development of}} their specific organelles, chloroplasts and other plastid-types, is finely tuned in accordance with the metabolic needs of the cell. The normal development and functioning of plastids require import of particular subsets of nuclear encoded proteins. Most preproteins contain a cleavable sequence at their N terminal (transit peptide) serving as a signal for targeting to the organelle and recognition by the translocation machinery TOC-TIC (Translocon of Outer membrane Complex, Translocon of Inner membrane Complex) spanning the <b>dual</b> membrane <b>envelope.</b> The plastid proteome needs constant remodeling in response to developmental and environmental factors. Therefore selective regulation of preprotein import plays a crucial role in plant development.

40|$|C 1 - Journal Articles RefereedThe <b>dual</b> {{membrane}} <b>envelopes</b> of Gram-negative bacteria provide two {{barriers of}} unlike nature that regulate {{the transport of}} molecules {{into and out of}} organisms. Organisms have developed several systems for transport across the inner and outer membranes. The Gram-negative periodontopathogenic bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis produces proteinase and adhesin complexes, gingipains/adhesins, on the cell surface and in the extracellular milieu as one of the major virulence factors. Gingipains and/or adhesins are encoded by kgp, rgpA, rgpB, and hagA on the chromosome. In this study, we isolated a P. gingivalis mutant (porT), which showed very weak activities of gingipains in the cell lysates and culture supernatants. Subcellular fractionation and immunoblot analysis demonstrated that precursor forms of gingipains and adhesins were accumulated in the periplasmic space of the porT mutant cells. Peptide mass fingerprinting and N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the precursor proteins and the kgp'-'rgpB chimera gene product in the porT mutant indicated that these proteins lacked the signal peptide regions, consistent with their accumulation in the periplasm. The PorT protein seemed to be membrane-associated and exposed to the periplasmic space, as revealed by subcellular fractionation and immunoblot analysis using anti-PorT antiserum. These results suggest that the membrane-associated protein PorT is essential for transport of the kgp, rgpA, rgpB, and hagA gene products across the outer membrane from the periplasm to the cell surface, where they are processed and matured.

Human listeners take advantage of differences between the sounds arriving at the two ears to determine the location of sound sources. For high-frequency components, interaural time differences (ITDs) carried in the envelopes together with inter aural level differences (ILDs) are primary cues for sound localization. These binaural cues are initially extracted in the superior olivary complex (SOC) of the brainstem, which consists of two major nuclei: the medial superior olive (MSO) and the lateral superior olive (LSO). Olivary neurons, like all neurons in the ascending auditory pathway, project to the inferior colliculus (IC), where binaural information is integrated and reorganized before reaching higher nuclei for further processing. In the present study, physiologically explicit models of high-frequency neurons in the MSO, the LSO, and the IC were developed to investigate underlying mechanisms behind several empirical observations of neural responses in these nuclei. These models were applied to reproduce neural responses to sinusoidally amplitude-modulated (SAM) stimuli. Specifically, this thesis examined the following empirical observations: 1) many LSO neurons exhibit substantial decrease in discharge rate with increasing modulation frequency (fm) of monaural SAM tone stimuli; 2) some high-frequency IC neurons show <b>dual</b> types of <b>envelope</b> ITD sensitivity in response to binaural SAM tones, with peak-type responses for some modulation frequencies (fm) and trough-type responses for other frequencies; 3) some high-frequency IC neurons show <b>dual</b> types of <b>envelope</b> ITD sensitivity in response to binaural SAM noises. In this third case, the neurons exhibit one type of ITD sensitivity (either peak-type or trough-type) to cochlear-generated (CG) envelopes and the other type of ITD sensitivity to amplitude modulation (AM) envelopes. Results from the model developed in the present study show the following: 1) low threshold potassium channels, and in some cases background inhibition, may play the major role in the firing rate decrease with increasing modulation frequency in the LSO; 2) convergent inputs from the MSO and the LSO can account for the dual types of ITD sensitivity observed in some high-frequency IC neurons in response to binaural SAM tones, as long as the firing rates in the inputs from the MSO and the LSO are tuned to different fm; 3) the same neural connections (convergent inputs from MSO and LSO) can also explain the combination of peak-type and trough-type responses observed in the IC in response to SAM noises with correlated fine structures, in which case both CG and AM envelope ITDs are present. In addition to the simulation of empirical data, these models provide quantitative predictions which can be tested with future empirical experiments to further enrich our understanding of the neural basis of envelope processing...|$|R
40|$|Since {{they were}} first defined in the 1950 's, {{projective}} covers (the <b>dual</b> of injective <b>envelopes)</b> {{have proved to be}} an important tool in module theory, and indeed in many other areas of abstract algebra. An attempt to generalise the concept led to the introduction of covers with respect to other classes of modules, for example, injective covers, torsion-free covers and at covers. The at cover conjecture (now a Theorem) is of particular importance, it says that every module over every ring has a at cover. This has led to surprising results in cohomological studies of certain categories. Given a general class of objects X, an X-cover of an object A can be thought of a the 'best approximation' of A by an object from X. In a certain sense, it behaves like an adjoint to the inclusion functor. In this thesis we attempt to initiate the study of different types of covers for the category of acts over a monoid. We give some necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of X covers for a general class X of acts, and apply these results to specific classes. Some results include, every S act has a strongly at cover if S satisfies Condition (A), every S-act has a torsion free cover if S is cancellative, and every S-act has a divisible cover if and only if S has a divisible ideal. We also consider the important concept of purity for the category of acts. Giving some new characterisations and results for pure monomorphisms and pure epimorphisms...|$|R
40|$|Well {{integrity}} is defined as:” {{the application of}} technical, operational and organizational solutions to reduce risk of uncontrolled release of formation fluids, throughout {{the life cycle of}} a well” (1). An uncontrolled release of hydrocarbons to the surroundings may have devastating consequences involving loss of lives, environmental damage and huge economic impact. Therefore it is extremely important that the {{integrity is}} assured at all times. A two barrier criterion is required for all the wells on the Norwegian Continental Shelf in contact with an over pressured reservoir. The <b>dual</b> barrier <b>envelopes</b> shall reduce the risk of a hydrocarbon leak to the surroundings. The highest risk for a major accident is experienced and considered to be during drilling and well operations, and not in the production / injection phase. However, history clearly shows the risk for a blowout / well release from wells that have been in production with the Bravo and Snorre A blowouts as serious examples. With today’s extended well lifetime, the integrity in the operational phase needs increased focus as the failure rate in old wells may become more frequent. To have overview and control of the wells in operation a categorization system for well integrity was developed in Norwegian Oil and Gas Recommended Guidelines 117, chapter 4. This system is based on the condition and number of barriers in a well, thus it is in direct association with the probability of a leak to the surroundings. Operators on the Norwegian Continental Shelf have used this system as a basis when developing their own risk status codes, but there is a common interest for a categorization system that captures the total risk picture in a better way. By only looking into the physical barrier status of the wells, {{an important part of the}} overall risk is left out. The leak is not quantified (above the acceptance criteria), if it is serious or insignificant, and the potential consequences of the leak are not taken into consideration. Statoil is one of the operators realizing the need for a risk status code that includes these aspects. They have experienced difficulties when ranking and prioritizing wells outside the dual barrier criterion, and are interested in a system for further differentiation of the most critical wells. In this way the most risky wells can be prioritized first and evaluated in a more detailed risk assessment. The main scope of this thesis is suggesting a categorization system describing the overall risk in a better way than the existing. This is done by implementing the potential consequences as a second dimension in addition to the barrier status. Risk can be defined as the combination of the probability of an event and the associated consequences, and a status including both these elements will give a better description of the overall risk. As the main task is producing a new classification system for the consequences, this will be the part emphasized in the suggested models. In combination with the existing barrier status codes (based on the color codes in Norwegian Oil and Gas Recommended Guidelines 117 for Well Integrity) this gives a status which represents a more complete risk picture. This thesis suggests several systems for consequence categorization, and the one most representative is presented as model 3. By testing it on 5 field cases, the results clearly show why the new system gives a better description of the overall risk contra the existing. ...|$|R
