2500|$|When Norwich sacked manager Nigel Worthington, Roberts {{applied for}} the manager's job. [...] "I tried to go for it... knowing I wasn't {{going to get it}} but I'd never really been for an {{interview}} and I thought if I did it would stand me in good stead. But I never got a response from the club and that really disappointed me. A week after Peter Grant got the job <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> through the post saying 'We won't be considering you this time'. And I thought 'I've known that for the past seven days'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed; <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> {{from the}} archdeacon only this morning, {{which made it}} {{absolutely}} necessary that I should come." ...|$|E
60|$|One day <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> from my sister. It {{was long}} and newsy, and the eighth page was most interesting.|$|E
60|$|LUCY Yes, but <b>I</b> have--I've <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> {{for you in}} my pocket.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was <b>a</b> mistake. <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> from my old aunt in Hampshire, {{written to}} my mother when I was born, which proves the mistake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Women do," [...] said Lord Chiltern. [...] "Lady Glencora will {{be delighted}} to reign,--though I can hardly fancy her by any other name. By the bye, Adelaide, <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Three {{days ago}} <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> from Italy, {{forwarded}} from P'kipsee, saying that Fernando {{had been killed}} in a gondola accident." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know {{anything}} about that," [...] returned the money-lender's son. [...] "But I know Link Merwell is alive. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> from him yesterday." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's at Framley now, I know. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> only {{yesterday}} from his wife, with a commission. He was there, and Lord Lufton had just left." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Almiry bid me good-by {{with all}} the grim look gone out of her face, many thanks, and a hearty promise to write soon. That was in April. <b>A</b> week ago <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> short <b>letter</b> saying,-- ...|$|R
5000|$|I hadn’t {{even thought}} about it for a couple of years, and he goes, [...] "Well yes, as a matter of fact, <b>I</b> just <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> from him. Do you feel like helping a down-on-his-luck folk singer?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And wouldn't I be {{very glad}} to? but she wouldn't come among strangers at once; and so <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter,</b> which she wrote for me, {{to put in}} the post, in case they are glad to see me, and then she will come on.' ...|$|R
60|$|And then, one evening, which {{happened}} to be my evening off, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter,</b> and for ten minutes after I read it I was knocked flat.|$|E
6000|$|Then one day <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> from [...] "Kipper" [...] {{to say he}} {{was over}} for a holiday and was {{stopping}} at Morley's, and asking me to look him up.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, Dick. I don't think I should go, anyhow, until I saw you again--not even if <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> {{saying that}} I was to sail {{by the next}} ship." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, my dear, as you {{generally}} {{have your own}} way, I suppose we shall finally settle on that, whether we agree now or three days hence. By the way, <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> in my pocket for you from him. The Cape mail touched at Plymouth yesterday." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{consult the}} police!" [...] exclaimed Mr. Troy in amazement. [...] "Surely, I {{have not made}} myself understood? I am going to the Head Office; and <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> of {{introduction}} to the chief inspector in the detective department. I am afraid I omitted to mention that?" ...|$|R
60|$|Direct to care of Major Hapgood as before, {{and write}} soon. Mother, <b>I</b> suppose you <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>I</b> wrote from down here last Monday.|$|R
6000|$|... "What?" [...] flashed Pan, {{noting the}} other's sudden change to gravity. [...] "It's {{two years and}} more since <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> from Mother. I wrote a couple of times, but she never answered." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They are {{at their}} city home just now; <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> day before yesterday," [...] {{answered}} the former major of the school battalion. He did not deem it necessary to say the letter was from Laura Ford.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, not much. All I {{know about}} it is that {{a year or so ago}} <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> from Mackenzie, the Scotch missionary, whose station, [...] "The Highlands", is placed at the highest navigable point of the Tana River, in which he said {{something}} about it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] said Tom calmly. [...] "I was a chump {{to remain}} behind--only I {{wanted to find}} you. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> hold of <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> by accident." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{had been}} gone a {{fortnight}} when the telegram was put into my hands. <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> from my sister, a few hours before, saying that all was well at home. The telegram said in five words that she had died suddenly the previous night. There {{was no mention of}} my mother, and I was three days’ journey from home.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I shall {{tell you}} the truth, Fred. <b>I</b> think mother <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter,</b> {{but she did not}} shew it me. She said just a word, but nothing more. Father Marty will {{certainly}} know if she knows." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, of course, we {{gave you}} up again, {{when we heard}} of the {{massacre}} of the mission; {{and it seemed like}} a resurrection from the dead when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> from Roberts, saying you were found again, and that he was recommending you for a commission.|$|E
60|$|Dear mother, I {{have not}} heard from George himself; but <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> from Fred McReady, a young Brooklyn man in 51st--he is {{intimate}} with George, said he was well and hearty. I got the letter about five days ago. I wrote to George four days since, directed to Winchester, Kentucky. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> from a friend in Nashville, Tenn., yesterday--he told me the 9th Army Corps was ordered to move to Murfreesboro, Tenn. I don't know whether this is so or not. I send papers to George almost every day. So far I think it was fortunate the 51st was moved West, and I hope it will continue so. Mother, it is all a lottery, this war; {{no one knows what}} will come up next.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} in Victoria a few days," [...] he explained. [...] "There was a machine I had to buy, {{and one or two}} other matters had to be {{attended}} to.

6000|$|... "Yes, {{that is his}} name; {{although}} he is always called Straight Harry. Yes, <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> for you. Come along with me." [...] He led the way into a small room behind the saloon, that served at once as his bed-room and office, and motioned to Tom to {{sit down on the}} only chair; then going to a cupboard he took out a tin canister, and opening it shook out half <b>a</b> dozen <b>letters</b> on to the table.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Willie, I--I {{know him}} a--at least I {{have met with}} him often. You see I was better off once, and used to mingle with--but I need not trouble you with that. On the {{strength}} of our former acquaintance, I thought I would write and ask him to get you a situation in an office, and <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> from him, just before you came down to breakfast, saying that he will do what he can, and bidding me send you to him between eleven and twelve to-morrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Last Monday week {{he went up}} to Birmingham, and {{he promised}} to be back on Thursday, and he never came, and he didn't come on the Friday, so I wrote to ask what was the matter, and he never {{answered}} the letter. And I wrote and said that if I didn't hear from him by return I'd go up to Birmingham, and this morning <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> solicitor's <b>letter</b> to say I had no claim on him, and if I molested him he'd seek the protection of the law." ...|$|R
6000|$|I mailed {{my letter}} to Mr. Smythe February 6th, {{and three days}} later <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> from the selfsame Smythe, dated Melbourne, December 17th. I would as soon have {{expected}} to get {{a letter from the}} late George Washington. The letter began somewhat as mine to him had begun--with a self-introduction: ...|$|E
60|$|A year passed away, {{and at last}} <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> {{from one}} of my friends, dated from the Arctic regions, {{near the mouth of}} Mackenzie River; the other wrote to me from among the snow-clad caps of the Rocky Mountains; while I {{addressed}} them from the swampy, ice-begirt shores of Hudson Bay.|$|E
6000|$|Alton laughed softly. [...] "That's where you're wrong. I {{wrote them}} {{wanting to know}} if they thought it my duty to open up the country for them, and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> that the affair is {{receiving}} consideration. If the bush country members can get the new appropriation through, the surveyor's going up to look at what we've done." ...|$|E
60|$|Pretty {{soon after}} that I was sick, and used up, and had {{to go off to}} the Hot Springs. When there, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> good many <b>letters</b> from commanders saying they wanted me to come back. I declined, because I wasn't well enough or strong enough; but I kept still, and kept the {{reputation}} I had made.|$|R
6000|$|Next {{morning by}} the second post <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> long <b>letter</b> from the Professor, which {{completely}} relieved me from all immediate anxiety as to his interpretation of my conduct. He rose to the fly with a charming simplicity which showed how delighted he was at this personal confirmation of all his own most cherished superstitions. [...] "My dear Mansfield," [...] his letter began, [...] "now hear what, at the very self-same hour and minute, {{happened to me in}} Piccadilly." [...] In fact, he had swallowed the whole thing entire, without a single moment's scepticism or hesitation.|$|R
40|$|Hi Light of My Life – You {{know how}} {{you get the feeling}} of how high you really are when you fly over certain things—like a radio tower or something. Well <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> feeling the other night—sort of a {{realization}} that it had actually been ten months practically since I had seen you—and it didn’t feel a bit good, in fact I felt rather panicky. Usually it just doesn’t seem that long, which is <b>a</b> blessing <b>I</b> guess. <b>Got</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> from Mom tonight, she’s fine, and said she had read in the paper that they were giving leave 2 ̆ 6 would you get any. Sort of a coincidence because I hadn’t mentioned that you might [...] ...|$|R
