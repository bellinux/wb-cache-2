The influence of different factors such as temperature, solvent polarity, mim concentration, and water content on Kmim by using 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride {[C 4 C 1 im]Cl} as a model compound was comprehensively studied. The calculated thermodynamic functions of transfer (∆trG 0, ∆trH 0, ∆trS 0) showed that the mim migration (IL→organic phase) is a thermodynamically unfavorable and enthalpy-determined process in the temperature range of 298. 15 to 328. 15 K; however, the results suggested that mim partition toward the organic phase can be enhanced by the rational manipulation of the extraction conditions. Experiments conducted with other 1 -alkyl- 3 -methylimidazolim chlorides (CnC 1 im]Cl (n = 6, 8, 10) revealed that mim possesses similar behavior and can be successfully washed out from the ILs by extraction with organic solvents.
