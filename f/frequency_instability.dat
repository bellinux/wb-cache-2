40|$|This thesis {{details the}} first {{measurements}} of Rydberg dipole blockade {{in a cold}} ensemble of divalent atoms. Strontium atoms are cooled and trapped in a magneto-optical trap and coherently excited to Rydberg states in a two-photon, three-level ladder scheme. Owing to the divalent nature of strontium, one electron can be excited to the Rydberg state, whilst the other lower-lying electron is available to undergo resonant optical excitation to autoionising states, which ionise in sub-nanosecond timescales. The remaining ions that are recorded on a micro-channel plate are proportional {{to the number of}} Rydberg atoms. The development of a narrow linewidth laser system necessary for an additional stage of cooling is explained and characterised.

During the expansion phase, the PSD of the substorm auroral arc is enhanced significantly in the low azimuthal mode number range as shown in Fig.  4. Thus, we suggest the observations can be {{explained in terms of}} the scenario that when the kinetic ballooning instability (Pi 2 disturbance) grows to large amplitude and saturates around the substorm onset, the ion velocity distribution forms bump-on-tail velocity distribution which provides the free energy for exciting higher <b>frequency</b> <b>instabilities</b> such as the cross-tail current instability.
