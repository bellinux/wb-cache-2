50|$|The {{supporting}} {{evidence of the}} cooking hypothesis argues that compared to the nutrients in the raw food, nutrients in cooked food are much easier to digest for hominids {{as shown in the}} research of protein ingestion from raw vs. cooked egg. Such a feature is essential for brain evolution: through studying the metabolic activities between primate species, scientists had found that there is a limitation of energy harvesting through food sources due to limited feeding time. Besides the brain, other organs in the human body also demand a high level of metabolism. At the same time, the body mass portion of different organs was changing throughout the process of evolution as a means for brain expansion. Homo genus was able to break through the limit by cooking food to lower their feeding time and be able to absorb more nutrients to accommodate the increasing need for energy. In addition, scientists argue that the Homo species was also able to obtain nutrients like <b>DHA</b> (<b>Docosahexaenoic</b> <b>acid)</b> from algae that were especially beneficial and critical for brain evolution and, as mentioned in the previous sections, the detoxification of the cooking process enabled early humans to access these resources.|$|E

Aspirin-triggered-PD1 (AT-PD1 or AP-NPD1) is the 17R-hydroxyl diastereomer of PD1 formed by the initial metabolism of DHA by aspirin-treated COX-2 or possibly a cytochrome P450 enzyme to 17R-hydroxy-DHA and its subsequent metabolism possibly in manner similar to that which forms PD1. 10-Epi-PD1 (ent-AT-NPD1), the 10S-hydroxy diastereomer of PD1, has been detected in small amounts in human neutrophils. While its in vivo synthetic pathway has not been defined, 10-epi-PD1 has anti-inflammatory activity.

40|$|This {{study was}} to {{investigate}} the efficient method for the extraction of astaxanthin from krill. To apply supercritical fluid extraction technique in order to recover astaxanthin from krill, it is essential to know the solubility of astaxanthin in supercritical carbon dioxide(S-CO 2) with varying pressure and temperature. In this work, pure and modified S-CO 2 was used as solvent. Experiments were carried out under different conditions. The effects of different parameters, such as pressure (80 to 280 bar), temperature (35 to 45 °C), modifier volume and extraction time (1 - 4 h), on the SCO 2 extraction for oil including astaxanthin from krill were investigated in order to evaluate their influence on the yield and composition of the krill oil. Organic solvent extraction with the same sample was performed and used as a comparative method. The chemical composition of each supercritical fluid extraction sample has been analyzed by HPLC and GC and the global composition were compared with that obtained by organic solvent extraction. The main fatty acids from krill were Tridecanoic acid,heptadecanoic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, palmitoleic acid, EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid), and <b>DHA</b> (<b>docosahexaenoic</b> <b>acid)</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Mass {{spectrometry}} {{with chemical}} cross-linking {{was used to}} probe the conformational changes of HSA (human serum albumin) in solution on interaction with monounsaturated OA (oleic acid) or polyunsaturated AA (arachidonic acid) or <b>DHA</b> (<b>docosahexaenoic</b> <b>acid).</b> Fatty acid-free or -bound HSA was modified with lysine-specific cross-linkers and digested with trypsin. Cross-linked peptides were analysed by nano-electrospray ionization MS to localize the sites of cross-linking. Our data indicated that a local conformational change involving movement of the side chains of Lys- 402 of subdomain IIIA or Lys- 541 of subdomain IIIB occurred upon binding of all three fatty acids. Our data also indicated that the side chains of Lys- 205 (IIA) and Lys- 466 (IIIA) moved closer towards each other upon binding AA or DHA, but not OA, suggesting that the conformations of HSA when bound to mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acids are distinctively different. While these observations agreed with previous X-ray crystallographic studies, the distances between ε-amino groups of most cross-linked lysine pairs were shorter than the crystal structure predicted, possibly reflecting a discrepancy between the solution and crystal structures. This method {{can serve as a}} useful complement to X-ray crystallography, particularly in probing the structure of a protein in solution...|$|E
40|$|Purpose Blood lipids are {{frequently}} {{used as a}} surrogate of lipid composition of peripheral tissues. Even if it is well accepted, such a relationship has never been clearly demonstrated for the eye. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine in human samples whether a lipidomic approach based on red blood cells could reveal associations between circulating and ocular lipid profiles. Methods Red blood cells, retinas and optic nerves were collected from 9 human donors. The lipidomic analyses on these tissues were done by both, gas chromatography and liquid chromatography coupled to an electrospray ionization source-mass spectrometer (LC-ESI-MS/MS). Results Gas chromatographic approach did not show any relevant association between circulating and ocular lipids except for arachidonic acid whose circulating amounts were positively associated with its retinal and optic nerve levels. However, significant associations emerged from LC-ESI-MS/MS analyses. Indeed, phospholipid species in red blood cells were positively or negatively associated with representative pools of retinal <b>DHA</b> (<b>docosahexaenoic</b> <b>acid),</b> retinal VLC-PUFA (very-long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids) or optic nerve plasmalogens. Conclusions First, our results show that LC-ESI-MS/MS methodology is more appropriate than gas chromatography for lipidomics on red blood cells, and further extrapolation to ocular lipids. Second, this study has identified several individual lipid species that can be good candidates to represent circulating biomarkers of ocular lipids...|$|E

MAG and DAG containing eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and <b>docosahexaenoic</b> (<b>DHA)</b> <b>acids</b> were produced in a solvent-free system via glycerolysis of menhaden oil catalyzed by Novozym 435. The {{effect of the}} molar ratio of glycerol to oil, enzyme concentration, and reaction temperature on MAG and DAG production was assessed. The optimal temperature was {{in the range of}} 55 - 70 _C for production of both acylglycerols. The increase in the substrates molar ratio led to a decrease in MAG and DAG content. The enzyme concentration was fixed at the lowest level evaluated (5 %, by weight of substrates). High content of MAG (25 % by weight) and DAG (41 % by weight) containing, respectively, 12. 46 % EPA and 11. 16 % DHA, and 14. 57 % EPA and 13. 70 % DHA, were produced after 24 h at 70 _C, with 5 % of lipase (by weight of substrate) and a glycerol-to-oil molar ratio of 1 : 1. For this reaction, a molar triacylglycerol (TAG) conversion of about 60 % was achieved at equilibrium (10 h). (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOmega- 3 {{polyunsaturated}} {{fatty acids}} (n- 3 PUFA), enriched in fish oils, are increasingly recognized to have potential benefits for treating many human afflictions. Despite {{the importance of}} PUFA, their molecular mechanism of action remains unclear. One emerging hypothesis is that phospholipids containing n- 3 PUFA acyl chains modify the structure and composition of membrane rafts, thus affecting cell signaling. In this study the two major n- 3 PUFA found in fish oils, eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and <b>docosahexaenoic</b> (<b>DHA)</b> <b>acids,</b> are compared. Using solid-state 2 H NMR spectroscopy we explored the molecular organization of 1 -[2 H 31]palmitoyl- 2 -eicosapentaenoylphosphatidylcholine (PEPC-d 31) and 1 -[2 H 31]palmitoyl- 2 -docosahexaenoylphosphatidylcholine (PDPC-d 31) in mixtures with sphingomyelin (SM) and cholesterol (chol). Our results indicate that whereas both PEPC-d 31 and PDPC-d 31 can accumulate into SM-rich/chol-rich raftlike domains, the tendency for DHA to incorporate into rafts {{is more than twice}} as great as for EPA. We propose that DHA may be the more bioactive component of fish oil that serves to disrupt lipid raft domain organization. This mechanism represents an evolution in the view of how PUFA remodel membrane architecture...|$|R
40|$|Obesity is tightly {{connected}} with metabolic diseases including insulin resistance, {{type 2 diabetes}} or dyslipidemia. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) -α is a key transcription factor involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism, while its activity is stimulated {{by a variety of}} hypolipidemic drugs. n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), including eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and <b>docosahexaenoic</b> (<b>DHA)</b> <b>acid,</b> are endogenous ligands of PPARα, and they are used in the form of fish oil as dietary supplements in order to lower blood lipid levels and to prevent cardiovascular disease. Wax esters represent a novel lipid form of EPA and DHA, and according to recent studies they could exert more potent effects than the classical fish oil (i. e. triacylglycerols). Mice of the 129 S 1 /SvImJ inbred strain were used in the present experiment, and included wild-type (WT) mice, as well as transgenic mice either with the exclusive expression of the human form of PPARα (hPPARα) or mice completely lacking PPARα (PPARα-KO). Mice were fed for 8 weeks the following diets: (i) a control low-fat diet, (ii) obesogenic high-fat diet (cHF), and (iii) the cHF diet supplemented with the n- 3 PUFA concentrate in the form of wax esters isolated from marine zooplankton Calanus finmarchicus (ω 3 Cal).
