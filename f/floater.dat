5|$|Before the {{construction}} of the causeway, the Petitcodiac River was home to many aquatic species. Fish originally included hundreds of thousands of Atlantic tomcod and rainbow smelt, tens of thousands of gaspereau and American shad, thousands of American eel, Atlantic salmon, brook trout, lamprey, and striped bass and hundreds of Atlantic sturgeon. Other fish include the blueback herring, the brown bullhead, the chain pickerel, the smallmouth bass, the white perch, and the white sucker. Marine mammals were uncommon, but normally consisted of pilot whales, Atlantic white-sided dolphins, harbour porpoise, harbour seals, and porbeagles. Freshwater mollusc species included the brook <b>floater,</b> the dwarf wedgemussel, the eastern ellipto, the eastern <b>floater,</b> the eastern pearlshell, and the triangle <b>floater.</b> Many other aquatic organisms are thought to have once entered the watershed due to the low salinity of the water.|$|E

40|$|In many {{territorial}} species, {{a fraction}} of all mature individuals are classified as <b>floaters,</b> and {{little is known about}} how these animals eventually acquire a breeding territory of their own. We observed intrusion behavior of <b>floaters,</b> subsequently removed breeding birds, and then observed <b>floaters</b> as they were filling these vacancies in an oystercatcher, Haematopus ostralegus, population. Birds familiar with the area and its inhabitants filled 80 % of the experimentally created vacancies. These could be either neighbors or <b>floaters</b> with a former breeding history nearby, but they were mainly <b>floaters</b> with an intrusion record nearby. <b>Floaters</b> obtaining experimentally vacated territories intruded significantly nearer to this territory before removal compared with <b>floaters</b> not obtaining the vacancy. In general, vacancies that were not occupied by intruding <b>floaters</b> tended to be located in areas where less intruding <b>floaters</b> were seen prior to removal. We show quantitatively that only birds familiar with a site succeed in establishing a territory at that site, suggesting that local information is essential for territory acquisition. We propose that the main aim of intrusion behavior may be the collection of such information.

25|$|Laser vitreolysis is a {{possible}} treatment option {{for the removal of}} vitreous strands and opacities (floaters). In this procedure an ophthalmic laser (usually a yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG) laser) applies a series of nanosecond pulses of low-energy laser light to evaporate the vitreous opacities and to sever the vitreous strands. During this process, the laser energy evaporates the collagen and hyaluronin molecules to form a gas. (It {{is important to note that}} the laser energy applied during vitreolysis treatment does not simply break the <b>floater</b> into smaller pieces. Instead, the laser energy converts the <b>floater</b> material to a gas, which is then absorbed into the eye.) The end result is that the <b>floater</b> is removed and/or reduced to a size that no longer impedes vision.|$|E

We used a series of removals to estimate the population of non-breeding after-second-year male red-winged blackbirds in two townships in the northern Great Plains. The number of <b>floaters</b> determines the level of competition for vacant territories.

40|$|Inverse <b>floaters</b> are {{generally}} {{thought to be}} volatile securities. And, standing alone, they {{may in fact be}} volatile. If they are used properly in a portfolio context, how-ever, they can serve as hedging vehicles for a buy-to-hold investor concerned with rein-vestment income and thereby reduce the income volatility of a debt securities portfolio. This result occurs because, during periods of low interest rates, high coupon payments from inverse <b>floaters</b> offset the lower reinvestment rate, and vice versa. The presence of inverse <b>floaters</b> thereby creates a natural hedge against reinvestment risk. Using a two-factor interest rate model and Monte Carlo simulations, this study compares the expected income and volatility of seven different investment portfolios: 3 -month T-bills, 5 -year T-notes, 5 -year zero-coupon bonds, 5 -year inverse <b>floaters,</b> T-notes plus inverse <b>floaters,</b> and T-notes plus inverse <b>floaters</b> plus repurchase agreements in varying amounts.

25|$|The {{number of}} {{floaters}} treated during a treatment session {{depends on the}} type of floater(s) and the laser energy required to treat the floater(s) (that is, to convert the <b>floater</b> material into a gas). During treatment, the ophthalmologist will monitor the level of laser energy used for each shot, as well as the total amount of energy delivered to the eye. In order to ensure safe, effective treatment with minimal patient discomfort, if these energy levels fall outside a predetermined range then any remaining floaters will need to be treated in a subsequent treatment session.|$|E

25|$|Floaters {{are able}} to catch and refract light in ways that {{somewhat}} blur vision temporarily until the <b>floater</b> moves to a different area.

Most persons come to terms with the problem, after a time, and learn to ignore their floaters. For persons with severe floaters it is nearly impossible to completely ignore the large masses that constantly stay within almost direct view.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{its status}} as a college town, Eugene has been home to many music genres, musicians and bands, ranging from {{electronic}} dance music such as dubstep and drum and bass to garage rock, hip hop, folk and heavy metal.

Key examination features include the nature of the flashes and <b>floaters,</b> whether one or both eyes are affected and changes in visual acuity or visual field.
