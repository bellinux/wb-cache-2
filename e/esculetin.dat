40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effect and its mechanism of <b>esculetin</b> on human gastric carcinoma SGC- 7901 cells, the effect of <b>esculetin</b> on human gastric carcinoma SGC- 7901 cells were investigated by MTT method in vitro studies. Then the morphological feature changes of apoptosis cells with <b>esculetin</b> of different concentration by transmission electron microscope were observed and the levels of Cty-c in SGC- 7901 cells line using FCM method were analyzed. The results revealed that the <b>Esculetin</b> significantly inhibited the growth of human gastric carcinoma SGC- 7901 cells and greatly decreased its growth rate with the <b>esculetin</b> concentration increased, and then the morphological feature changes of apoptosis cells had been observed. After 24 h, <b>esculetin</b> could make that the concentration of Cty-c in endochylema and Caspase- 3 were all increased. Thus the study showed that <b>esculetin</b> remarkably inhibited the growth of human gastric carcinoma SGC- 7901 cells and induce its apoptosis...|$|E

40|$|Background: Although <b>esculetin,</b> a {{coumarin}} compound, {{is known}} to induce apoptosis in human cancer cells, the effects and molecular mechanisms on the apoptosis in human malignant melanoma (HMM) cells are not well understood yet. In this study, we investigated the anti-proliferative effects of <b>esculetin</b> on the G 361 HMM cells. Methods: We analyzed the anti-proliferative effects and molecular mechanisms of <b>esculetin</b> on G 361 cells by a 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 5 -(3 -carboxymethoxy phenyl) - 2 -(4 -sulfophenyl) - 2 H-tetrazolium assay, 4 ', 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole staining and Western blotting. Results: <b>Esculetin</b> exhibited significant anti-proliferative effects on the HMM cells in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, we found that <b>esculetin</b> induced nuclear shrinkage and fragmentation, typical apoptosis markers, by suppression of Sp 1 transcription factor (Sp 1). Notably, <b>esculetin</b> modulated Sp 1 downstream target genes including p 27, p 21 and cyclin D 1, resulted in activation of apoptosis signaling molecules such as caspase- 3 and PARP in G 361 HMM cells. Conclusions: Our results clearly demonstrated that <b>esculetin</b> induced apoptosis in the HMM cells by downregulating Sp 1 protein levels. Thus, we suggest that <b>esculetin</b> may be a potential anti-proliferative agent that induces apoptotic cell death in G 361 HMM cells...|$|E
40|$|Recently, an {{interesting}} debate arose {{about the nature}} (substrate versus inhibitor) of <b>esculetin,</b> a coumarin derivative, for mushroom polyphenol oxidase (PPO). The present study examined the behavior of PPOs preparations from fungal and plant origin towards <b>esculetin</b> as a substrate. Both enzymes were able to oxidize <b>esculetin</b> though at a slow rate. A higher sensitivity was reached when the assay was performed {{in the presence of}} 3 -methyl- 2 -benzothiazolinone hydrazone (MBTH) even with a lower amount of PPO. These observations unambiguously confirmed that <b>esculetin</b> has to be considered a substrate for mushroom polyphenol oxidase. The oxidation of <b>esculetin</b> was also demonstrated for the first time by a fungal laccase. This should be taken into account because some mushroom PPO preparations could exert contaminant laccase activity. In addition, a PPO preparation from Ferula communis was demonstrated to use <b>esculetin</b> as a substrate. Umbelliferone, the monophenolic precursor of <b>esculetin</b> along the phenylpropanoid pathway, behaved as a competitive inhibitor for the monophenolase activity of mushroom PPO with a K(i) value = 0. 014 mM. This is worth a mention because only a few couples of mono- and corresponding o-diphenol show such opposite behavior towards PPO.

The drug showed a concentration-dependent relaxant effect, with an EC 50 of 60 microM. Pretreatment with <b>esculetin</b> (30 - 60 microM) {{was not able}} to reduce the contractile response induced by either carbachol (0. 1 microM), histamine (10 microM), BaCl 2 (10 mM) or K+ (80 mM). <b>Esculetin</b> increased the contraction evoked by PGF 2 alpha and by histamine, but reduced A 23187 -induced contraction. Mepacrine (10 microM), a phospholipase A 2 inhibitor, reduced the relaxant effect of the lower <b>esculetin</b> concentrations (3 - 60 microM). Indomethacin (0. 1 microM) increased the relaxation induced by <b>esculetin</b> (3 - 10 microM). In tracheal chains from ovalbumin-sensitized guinea-pigs, <b>esculetin</b> (60 microM) significantly reduced the duration of the recovery phase after antigen challenge contraction.

40|$|The {{coumarin}} <b>esculetin</b> shows antioxidant {{action on}} some cell types, both by scavenging ROS and by decreasing ROS production. We have previously demonstrated the induction of apoptosis by <b>esculetin</b> on NB 4 human leukaemia cells by an ill-defined mechanism related to ROS levels. In this work, we analyze {{the effect of}} the simultaneous treatment with <b>esculetin</b> and two oxidants to observe the early events in the mechanism of esculetin-induced apoptosis. Our results show that, from the early time of 15 [*]min, <b>esculetin</b> acts synergistically with H 2 O 2 to decrease cell viability and metabolic activity and to increase apoptosis in NB 4 cells. In contrast, the early oxidative effects of t-BHP are neutralised by <b>esculetin,</b> protecting human leukaemia NB 4 cells from apoptosis. <b>Esculetin</b> seems to restrict the increase in peroxides caused by H 2 O 2 or t-BHP in the time interval analyzed. These results contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the cytotoxic effect caused by <b>esculetin</b> on NB 4 cells.

40|$|Recently, loss of {{endogenous}} glutathione during N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated excitotoxic injury, and {{the resultant}} overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through an arachidonic acid cascade process in brain, have been implicated in neuronal damage in various neurodegenerative diseases. Glutathione depletion induced by L-buthionine-(S,R) -sulfoximine (BSO), an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis, is known to cause arachidonic acid-mediated excitotoxicity in primary mixed cortical cultures. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether <b>esculetin</b> (6, 7 -dihydroxycoumarin), an inhibitor of lipoxygenase, protects against neurotoxicity induced by NMDA or BSO. We observed that neurotoxicity induced by NMDA but not kainic acid was attenuated by <b>esculetin.</b> At the same concentration (100 µM), <b>esculetin</b> attenuated the 45 Ca 2 + uptake elevation induced by NMDA. Free radical-mediated neuronal injury induced by H 2 O 2 and xanthine/xanthine oxidase was concentration-dependently blocked by <b>esculetin.</b> <b>Esculetin</b> (1 - 30 µM) dose-dependently inhibited BSO-induced neuronal injury. In addition, arachidonate-induced neurotoxicity was completely blocked by <b>esculetin.</b> BSO also reduced glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, but did not change glutathione reductase (GR) activity 24 h after treatment. <b>Esculetin</b> dose-dependently increased GR activity, but did not alter GPx activity. These findings suggest that <b>esculetin</b> can contribute to the rescue of neuronal cells from NMDA neurotoxicity and that this protective effect occurs partly through NMDA receptor modulation and the sparing of glutathione depletion...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the mechanism of protection of <b>esculetin</b> in human hepatoma HepG 2 cells against reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by hydrogen peroxide. Cell viability, cell integrity, intracellular glutathione levels, generation of reactive oxygen species and expression of antioxidant enzymes were used as markers to measure cellular oxidative stress and response to ROS. The protective effect of <b>esculetin</b> was compared to a well-characterized chemoprotective compound quercetin. Pre-treatment of HepG 2 cells with sub-lethal (10 - 25 μM) <b>esculetin</b> for 8 h prevented cell death and maintained cell integrity following exposure to 0. 9 mM hydrogen peroxide. An increase in the generation of ROS following hydrogen peroxide treatment was significantly attenuated by 8 h pre-treatment with <b>esculetin.</b> In addition, <b>esculetin</b> ameliorated the decrease in intracellular glutathione caused by hydrogen peroxide exposure. Moreover, treatment with 25 μM <b>esculetin</b> for 8 h increased the expression of NAD(P) H: quinone oxidoreductase (NQO 1) at both protein and mRNA levels significantly, by 12 -fold and 15 -fold, respectively. <b>Esculetin</b> treatment also increased nuclear accumulation of Nrf 2 by 8 -fold indicating that increased NQO 1 expression is Nrf 2 -mediated.

MethodsUmbelliferone, umbelliferone 6 -carboxylic acid, scopoletin, isoscopoletin, 7 -methoxy coumarin, scoparone, scopolin, and <b>esculetin</b> have been previously isolated; however 2 ′-isopropyl psoralene was isolated from Angelica decursiva {{for the first time}} to evaluate their inhibitory effects against acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE 1) enzyme activity. We scrutinized the potentials of coumarins as cholinesterase and BACE 1 inhibitors via enzyme kinetics and molecular docking simulation. ResultsAmong the test compounds, umbelliferone 6 -carboxylic acid, <b>esculetin</b> and daphnetin exhibited potent inhibitory activity against AChE, BChE and BACE 1. Both <b>esculetin</b> and daphnetin have a catechol group and exhibit significant anti-AD activity against AChE and BChE. In contrast, presence of a sugar moiety and methoxylation markedly reduced the anti-AD activity of the coumarins investigated in this study. With respect to BACE 1 inhibition, umbelliferone 6 -carboxylic acid, <b>esculetin</b> and daphnetin contained carboxyl or catechol groups, which significantly contributed to their anti-AD activities. To further investigate these results, we generated a 3 D structure of BACE 1 using Autodock 4. 2 and simulated binding of umbelliferone 6 -carboxylic acid, <b>esculetin</b> and daphnetin.

Warfarin was reproducibly detected in PBS and urine utilising both the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique and BIAcore, a biosensing instrument. Cross reactivity studies illustrated that accnocoumarin exhibited the highest degree of cross reactivity with the anti-warfarin mAb, as expected, due to its high degree of structural similarity to warfarin. Coumarin displayed negligible cross reactivity due to its low degree of structural similarity to warfarin. Kinetic studies of mAb preparations yielded both dissociation constant (Kd) and association constant (Ka) values for warfarin and three structurally similar analogues. The mAb was successfully characterised. Toxicological effects of four benzopyrone compounds were investigated on two carcinoma cell-lines (A 549 and MCF- 7).

Methods. In vitro studies were performed using rabbit articular cartilage explants. <b>Esculetin</b> 10 - 100 μM was added to cartilage explants in {{the presence or absence}} of interleukin 1 α (IL- 1 α). Effects of <b>esculetin</b> on cartilage metabolism were assessed. Proteoglycan release into medium was determined by dye precipitation with 1, 9 -dimethylmethylene blue, synthesis of proMMP- 1 (interstitial procollagenase) and proMMP- 3 (prostromelysin 1) by Western blotting, and collagen degradation activity using FITC labeled collagen. In vivo experimental OA was induced in the knee joints of 15 Japanese adult white rabbits by partial lateral meniscectomy. Ten rabbits were orally administered 200 or 400 mg/kg/day of CPA- 926 from the day of surgery for 14 days. The size of the macroscopic erosive area on the femoral condyle and tibial plateau was measured, and cartilage destruction was histologically evaluated. Collagenolytic activities in synovial fluid were measured using FITC labeled collagen as a substrate. Results. In vitro, <b>esculetin</b> inhibited the IL- 1 α induced release of proteoglycan into the medium in a dose dependent manner. The collagenolytic activities in cartilage explant medium induced by IL- 1 α were also suppressed with the addition of 33 - 100 μM <b>esculetin</b> (p = 0. 0209 at 33 and 100 μM, p = 0. 0202 at 66 μM). Western blotting of cartilage explant medium showed a decrease in the levels of proMMP- 1 and proMMP- 3 in the medium by treatment with <b>esculetin.</b> In vivo: At 14 days after surgery, the femoral condyle and tibial plateau in the control group showed macroscopic erosions of cartilage. Compared with the control group, the rabbits treated with CPA- 926 at the dose of 400 mg/kg exhibited reduction of the size of the erosive area on the tibial plateau (p = 0. 009). Histological evaluation indicated protection against the development of destructive changes in the tibial plateau cartilage at a dose of 200 mg/kg (p = 0. 0442) and 400 mg/kg (p = 0. 0446) of CPA- 926. Conclusion. These results indicate that <b>esculetin</b> inhibits matrix degradation in rabbit joint cartilage explants through the suppression of MMP synthesis, secretion, or activity.

The results show that dietary administration of umbelliferone and <b>esculetin</b> significantly attenuated MPTP-induced neurotoxicity in the substantia nigra pars compacta but not striatum, as measured by tyrosine hydroxylase staining. Both coumarins also prevented an MPTP-induced increase in nitrosative stress as measured by 3 -nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity and also maintained glutathione levels in MPTP-exposed mice as well as in cell lines exposed to the metabolite 1 -methyl- 4 -phenylpyridinium. Umbelliferone and <b>esculetin</b> also prevented MPTP-dependent caspase 3 activation, an indicator of apoptosis, but did not inhibit monoamine oxidase activity. This {{is the first time that}} the neuroprotective capabilities of these coumarins have been demonstrated, and the results indicate that umbelliferone and <b>esculetin</b> can protect against MPTP-induced neurotoxicity in the mouse. These compounds can cross the blood-brain barrier, so their effectiveness indicates that they have the potential to protect in neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinson's disease. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E
40|$|Objectives : <b>Esculetin</b> (6, 7 -dihydroxy{{coumarin}}) is {{a natural}} coumarin with anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive activity. It acts as a potent inhibitor of lipoxygenases (5 -LOX and 12 -LOX) and decreases the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP- 1, MMP- 3 and MMP- 9). Because both inhibition of lipoxygenases and inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases are effective strategies {{in the treatment of}} rheumatoid arthritis, we investigated whether <b>esculetin</b> may be effective in adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats. Material and methods : The study was performed on male Lewis rats, in the adjuvant-induced arthritis model. Rats were divided into two groups: control (treated with 1 % methylcellulose) and experimental (treated with <b>esculetin</b> – 10 mg/kg ip.). The tested compound was administered for 5 consecutive days starting on the 21 st day after induction of arthritis. Each group consisted of 7 animals. After 5 days of treatment, rats were anesthetized. The concentration of leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4) in plasma was determined by a competitive enzyme immunoassay. Results : The LTB 4 level in plasma of rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis is increased in comparison to rats without inflammation (362 ± 34 vs. 274 ± 15 pg/ml, p < 0. 01, respectively). Five-day treatment with <b>esculetin</b> in adjuvant-induced arthritis rats decreases the LTB 4 level to a level comparable with rats without inflammation (284 ± 23 pg/ml, p < 0. 01). Conclusions : LTB 4 is the most potent chemotactic agent influencing neutrophil migration into the joint. It is known that its level in serum of patients with active rheumatoid arthritis is increased and correlates with disease severity. Some other lipoxygenase inhibitors have already been tested as potential drug candidates in clinical and preclinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis (Zileuton, PF- 4191834). Because <b>esculetin</b> decreases the LTB 4 level in plasma of rats in adjuvant-induced arthritis, it may also be considered as an attractive drug candidate for patients with rheumatoid arthritis...|$|E
40|$|<b>Esculetin</b> (6, 7 -dihydroxy{{coumarin}}), one of coumarin analogous, {{has been}} found to exhibit broaden biological effects, such as anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-arrhythmic, and scavenging activities against reactive oxygen species. <b>Esculetin</b> is also a dominant component of Ash bark (qinpi), one famous traditional Chinese medicine widely used in Asian countries. In this study, a rapid profiling method by using ultra-fast liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry was developed for characterization of trace metabolites of <b>esculetin</b> in rat plasma after oral administration at dose of 50 mg/kg bw. Fifteen minutes after administration, nine metabolites including glucuronidated, methoxylated and sulfated derivatives of escultin were detected from rat plasma, but the parent drug can not be measured, indicating that escultin can be metabolized rapidly in rat. All metabolites were identified by UFLC-ESI-MS/MS, based on the product ions and typical fragmentation patterns of phase II metabolites. The major metabolite (M 1) was prepared by using rat liver microsomes and was fully characterized as 7 -O monoglucuronide <b>esculetin</b> by NMR. Two methoxylated metabolites (M 2, M 3) were assigned as scopoletin (6 -methoxylated escultin) and isoscopoletin (7 -methoxylated escultin) compared with authentic standards, and these two metabolites can be metabolized rapidly to glucuronidated derivatives (M 4, M 5) both in vitro and in vivo. M 4 and M 5 can be rapidly assigned as monoglucuronides of methoxylated escultin according to their typical product ions including m/z 367, m/z 191 and m/z 176. In addition, two monosulfated derivatives of escultin (M 6, M 7) and two monosulfated metabolites of methoxylated escultin (M 8, M 9) were also identified based on their informative product ions which are m/z 257 and m/z 177 for monosulfated escultin, as well as m/z 271, m/z 191 and m/z 176 for monosulfated metabolites of methoxylated escultin. In summary, this study revealed three biotransformation pathways of <b>esculetin</b> in rat including glucuronidation, methoxylation and sulfation, while the selective 7 -O-glucuronidation is its major metabolic pathway which quite different from its analogous daphenetin. These results are very helpful for understanding the in vivo metabolism and efficacy of escultin, as well as for improving the metabolic stability of this compound.

40|$|Superficial mycoses are {{fungal infections}} {{of the outer}} layers of the skin, hair and nails that affect 20 – 25 % of the world’s population, with {{increasing}} incidence. Treatment of superficial mycoses, predominantly caused by dermatophytes, is by topical and/or oral regimens. New therapeutic options with improved efficacy and/or safety profiles are desirable. There is renewed interest in natural product-based antimicrobials as alternatives to conventional treatments, including the treatment of superficial mycoses. We investigated the potential of coumarins as dermatophyte-specific antifungal agents and describe {{for the first time}} their potential utility as topical antifungals for superficial mycoses using a prodrug approach. Here we demonstrate that an inactive coumarin glycone, esculin, is hydrolysed to the antifungal coumarin aglycone, <b>esculetin</b> by dermatophytes. Esculin is hydrolysed to <b>esculetin</b> b-glucosidases. We demonstrate that b-glucosidases are produced by dermatophytes as well as members of the dermal microbiota, and that this activity is sufficient to hydrolyse esculin to <b>esculetin</b> with concomitant antifungal activity. A b-glucosidase inhibitor (conduritol B epoxide), inhibited antifungal activity by preventing esculin hydrolysis. Esculin demonstrates good aqueous solubility (, 6 g/l) and could be readily formulated and delivered topically as an inactive prodrug in a water-based gel or cream. This work demonstrates proof-of-principle for a therapeutic application of glycosylated coumarins as inactive prodrugs that could be converted t...|$|E

40|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} assumed to be caused by {{mitochondrial}} dysfunction in the affected dopaminergic neurons in the brain. We have recently created small chemicals, KUSs (Kyoto University Substances), which can reduce cellular ATP consumption. By contrast, agonistic ligands of ERRs (estrogen receptor-related receptors) are expected to raise cellular ATP levels via enhancing ATP production. Here, we show that <b>esculetin</b> functions as an ERR agonist, and its addition to culture media enhances glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration, leading to elevated cellular ATP levels. Subsequently, we show the neuroprotective efficacies of KUSs, <b>esculetin,</b> and GSK 4716 (an ERRγ agonist) against cell death in Parkinson's disease models. In the surviving neurons, ATP levels and expression levels of α-synuclein and CHOP (an ER stress-mediated cell death executor) were all rectified. We propose that maintenance of ATP levels, by inhibiting ATP consumption or enhancing ATP production, or both, would be a promising therapeutic strategy for Parkinson's disease...|$|E

The use of the fungal pathogen Beauveria bassiana as a nodulation elicitor, with inhibition of phospholipase A 2 by dexamethasone, extends the principle to fungi. This study also provides the first evidence of involvement of the lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway rather than the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway in synthesis of the nodulation mediating eicosanoid(s). The LOX product, 5 (S) - hydroperoxyeicosa- 6 E, 8 Z, 11 Z, 14 Z-tetraenoic acid (5 -HPETE), substantially reversed nodulation inhibition caused by dexamethasone and the LOX inhibitors, caffeic acid and <b>esculetin.</b> The COX product, prostaglandin H 2 (PGH 2), did not reverse the nodulation inhibition by dexamethasone or the COX inhibitor, ibuprofen.
