The Queen of the Wilis would enter, lay her cold hand on Giselle's heart and the girl would <b>drop</b> <b>dead.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{terms of}} {{differences}} {{from the original}} scene, there was a shift to a more post-punk sound {{as a result of}} the influence of the European bands of the 1980s.

The <b>Drop</b> <b>Dead</b> Festival, similar to psychobilly's Hootenanny, gave bands with smaller fan bases an opportunity to play before larger crowds.|$|E
