5|$|Initially, the {{governing}} power within Israel remained silent. However, on May 27, the Israeli daily Maariv printed a sceptical coverage of Arab accounts, which {{spoke of a}} great victory by the Arab Legion, involving some 800 Israeli dead. In response, the Israeli press stressed that {{the aim of the}} operation was not to take Latrun, but to strike the Legion and, on June 1, it published casualty figures of 250 deaths <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> side and 10 deaths, with 20 badly wounded, and another 20 lightly wounded on the Israeli side.|$|E
5|$|Manning is a trans woman who, in a {{statement}} the day after sentencing, {{said she had a}} female gender identity since childhood, wanted to be known as Chelsea, and desired to begin hormone replacement therapy. Reaction to Manning's disclosures, arrest, and sentence was mixed. Her biographer, Denver Nicks, writes that the leaked diplomatic cables were seen by some (but disputed by others) as a catalyst <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> Spring that began in December 2010, and that she was viewed by some as a 21st-century Tiananmen Square Tank Man and by others as an embittered traitor.|$|E
5|$|Writing for RT, Afshin Rattansi {{speculated that}} if 14 August protests are met with state violence, then {{it could be}} one of the last times Bahraini activists use {{peaceful}} means to seek democratic change and that other methods could include an armed struggle in the same way the anti-apartheid movement led by Nelson Mandela deployed armed tactics after peaceful protests failed to bring about change. Jean Shaoul wrote in the World Socialist Web Site that the concurrent timing of crackdown in Bahrain and Egypt was not a coincidence and that evidence showed it was coordinated by the Cooperation Council <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> States of the Gulf.|$|E

5|$|Although Sir Flinders {{himself did}} not join the {{expedition}} in 1929, he sent Olga {{with a group of}} other archaeologists to Qau, where they spent two months recording the reliefs from the tombs of the ancient rulers. She and a few colleagues, including Gerald Lankester Harding, then joined the season's primary expedition, which was being led by James Leslie Starkey at the Tell Far'a tomb group in Palestine. During the time she would not only supervise the work of a team, but also ran an evening clinic <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> workers and families, as well as other local people. In all, she would help up to forty people per day with minor injuries or upset stomachs. Sir Flinders joined the group in 1930 and after reviewing Olga's work, allowed her to publish it under her own name. In 1931, during the Petrie expedition to Tell el-'Ajjul, Olga discovered a Hyksos tomb which included a horse burial.|$|E
5|$|Asad's {{resolution}} in confronting the khagan, and the wise strategic choice of making Balkh his residence, paid off, and {{allowed him to}} salvage a situation that, {{in the wake of}} several defeats {{at the hands of the}} Turgesh, appeared seemingly hopeless—indeed, Caliph Hisham is said to have been incredulous at the first news of Asad's victory. The victory at Kharistan consolidated the Arab position in Khurasan, and particularly in Tokharistan, where the local rulers would certainly have gone over to the Turgesh if the latter had won or remained unopposed. Conversely the defeat diminished the prestige of Suluk, and may possibly have played a role in his assassination early in 738, although rivalries between the Turgesh, fanned by the Chinese court, were more directly responsible for it. The Turgesh khaganate then collapsed into infighting, and stopped being a serious threat to Arab interests in the area. As a result, the Battle of Kharistan is considered a turning point <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> fortunes in Central Asia.|$|E
5|$|On 8 March 1920, the Syrian National Congress {{proclaimed the}} {{establishment}} of the Kingdom of Syria, with Faisal as king. This unilateral action was immediately rejected by the British and French. In the San Remo Conference, which was called by the Allied Powers in April 1920, the allocation of mandates in the Arab territories was finalized, with France given a mandate over Syria. France's allocation of Syria was, in turn, repudiated by Faisal and the Syrian National Congress. After months of instability and failure to make good on the promises Faisal had made to the French, General Gouraud gave an ultimatum to Faisal on 14 July 1920 demanding that he disband the Arab Army and submit to French authority by 20 July or face a French military invasion. On 18 July, Faisal and the entire cabinet, with the exception of War Minister Yusuf al-'Azma, agreed to the ultimatum and issued disbandment orders <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> Army units at Anjar, the Beirut–Damascus road and the hills of the Anti-Lebanon Mountains overlooking the Beqaa Valley. Two days later, Faisal informed the French liaison in Damascus of his acceptance of the ultimatum, but for unclear reasons, Faisal's notification did not reach Gouraud until 21 July. Sources suspicious of French intentions accused the French of intentionally delaying delivery of the notice to give Gouraud an official excuse for advancing on Damascus. However, there has been no evidence or indication of French sabotage. News of the disbandment and Faisal's submission led to riots in Damascus on 20 July and their suppression by Emir Zeid, which led to around 200 deaths. Al-'Azma, who staunchly opposed surrender, implored Faisal to allow him and the remnants of his army to confront the French.|$|E
