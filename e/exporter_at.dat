25|$|Between 1709 and 1754, over £46,000 {{was spent}} to extend Lowther {{holdings}} {{of land and}} coal royalties in West Cumberland. The intention was to destroy his local competitors and establish a local monopoly; he failed to offer others high enough purchase prices to secure the properties needed for a monopoly, but by the 1740s Lowther was the dominant <b>exporter</b> <b>at</b> every harbour in the coalfield. Loans were made to local landowners {{in the hope that}} interest payments would not be met and Lowther would be able to foreclose on the property. Mine-owners at Moresby and Distington were bought out. Repeated attempts were made (through John Spedding and other third parties) to lease the pits at Workington owned by the Curwen family, but came to nothing. However, a lease (in conjunction with a junior partner) was secured (1731) of Seaton colliery, which Spedding regarded as the greatest obstacle to Lowther domination of the coalfield, and in 1734, the lessees of Clifton colliery agreed to limit their export sales to 7000 tons a year, to be sold to the lessees of Seaton colliery; an agreement which - Spedding assured Lowther - must put the coal trade through Workington harbour entirely in his hands. The junior partner in the Seaton lease later fell out with Lowther and Spedding, and alleged that Seaton was deliberately being run inefficiently to stifle competition with the Whitehaven pits.|$|E

50|$|The main {{benefit is}} that the {{enhanced}} price is paid not to a producers' co-operative, which normally comprises {{only a small percentage}} of the whole village, but to a village level co-operative that must have 90% membership. The products are bought by the village co-operatives from the local farmers at the normal market rates but are then sold onto the <b>exporter</b> <b>at</b> the enhanced WCP rates, which can produce a village level premium of up to 70% over the farm gate price. Coffee from the villages around the Lambusango and Cusuco sites run by Operation Wallacea were initially marketed under the Wicked Jungle Coffee brand. By cutting out middlemen and dealing directly with the farmer co-operatives, the prices paid for the products to the villages can be considerably higher than the Fair Trade rates but the final sale price in the western market can be comparable with Fair Trade. This scheme has great potential to substantially increase incomes in communities that are committed to protecting their adjacent forests and provides a market driven way of conserving forests.|$|E

40|$|Brazil has {{dramatically}} increased its agricultural area under cultivation, {{in the process}} becoming a major food <b>exporter</b> <b>at</b> the cost of natural forests. A new challenge is to meet the food demands of an expanding world population {{in the face of}} pessimistic climate change scenarios and the increasing scarcity of land. Can Brazil help meet rising world food demand while conserving its tropical rainforests? To address this question we simulate outcomes using a large dynamic multiregional computable general equilibrium model of Brazil to model land use over 20 years in 90 zones and 14 agricultural sectors. The model features a land-use change module based on a transition matrix obtained from satellite imagery. We analyze two scenarios of deforestation reduction, both linked to actual policy proposals. Model results indicate several mechanisms that allow food output to increase without expanding land supply. In particular, we stress the role of Brazil’s vast, low-yield pasture area as a source of future cropland. Thus, we find that controlling deforestation leads to rather small decreases in food output—which could be neutralized by tiny exogenous productivity improvements. We conclude that the decrease in deforestation will not significantly compromise Brazilian agricultural supply capacity in the foreseeable future...|$|E

40|$|Denmark {{possesses}} {{only a small}} {{share of}} the exploitation rights to North Sea oil and is a minor producer when compared to Norway and the UK. However, Denmark is still an oil exporter and a very important supplier of oil for certain countries, in particular Sweden. A field-by-field analysis of the Danish oil and gas fields, combined with estimated production contribution from new field developments, enhanced oil recovery and undiscovered fields, provides a future production outlook. The conclusion from this analysis is that by 2030 Denmark {{will no longer be}} an oil or gas <b>exporter</b> <b>at</b> all. Our results are also in agreement with the Danish Energy Authority’s own forecast, and may be seen as an independent confirmation of their general statements. Decreasing Danish oil production, coupled with a rapid decline in Norway’s oil output, will force Sweden to import oil from more distant markets in the future, dramatically reducing Swedish energy security. If no new gas suppliers are introduced to the Swedish grid, then Swedish gas consumption is clearly predestined to crumble alongside declining Danish production. Future hydrocarbon production from Denmark displays a clear link to Sweden’s future energy security...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the composition of exporters' currency pricing portfolio - number and value of product sales in different currencies at a destination - and their success in trade as measured by continuing to their exporting activity. Detailed investigation of currency choice data of Russian exporters between 2005 - 2009 shows that many exporters use only one currency pricing per destination. Among those who use more than one currency pricing, higher diversification is indeed associated with up to 18 % higher odds of survival as an <b>exporter</b> <b>at</b> the product-destination. Nevertheless, many exporters still use only one currency pricing per destination. This puzzle is explained in this paper by incorporating the concept of "exchange rate hedging costs" into the existent literature on currency choice.

It {{is a completely}} different genre from the merengue of the Dominican Republic {{in the way of}} its tempo, rhythm, instruments, culture and historical development. Merengue venezolano is also known by two other names: merengue caraqueño, relating its origin to the capital city Caracas, and merengue rucaneao, in which a reference to Rúcano, a mix for a popular jelly dessert, is used as a simile for the sensual pelvic movements of its dance. The merengue came into fashion in Venezuela during the period from the 1920 s until the 1940 s, the final years of a rural, backward country dominated by the dictator Juan Vicente Gómez, who died in 1935. The country’s economics had changed gradually from an agricultural-based industry to those of a modern nation, becoming in this time the world’s second largest oil <b>exporter.</b> <b>At</b> first, the music of merengue was closely associated with the mabiles, popular drinking and dancing places in Caracas, and with the capital’s Carnival celebrations in street parades and plazas.

It focuses {{on the impact of}} PRC 2 ̆ 019 s rise as a major exporter of manufactures, but it also considers bilateral trade between LAC and PRC. In response to falling trade costs and greater international capital mobility, PRC has emerged as a major <b>exporter</b> <b>at</b> both the labor-intensive low technology and increasingly at the knowledge-intensive higher technology end of the product spectrum. Latin America is still somewhat distant from this process. Some countries are benefiting from growing imports of primary and resource-based products by PRC, although in general PRC remains a relatively small market for LAC, although as an import supplier PRC overtook Japan in 2003. The trade structure of most of LAC is generally more complementary than competitive with that of PRC. The exceptions are principally Mexico and Costa Rica, which, similar to PRC, are closely integrated into production networks of MNCs. With a differing export structure the likelihood of damaging trade diversion effects is weakened. Our analysis of bilateral trade between LAC and PRC reveals a striking tendency towards a pattern of specialization with LAC a net exporter of primary products and a net importer of manufactures. The patterns of the two regions are almost a classic textbook illustration of trade between developing and industrialized regions, where the former (i. e. LAC) strengthens its specialization in primary products and processes resources while the latter (i. e. PRC) does the reverse. What is surprising is that LAC is the richer region, with a longer history of modern industrialization, higher human resources, more FDI per capita and with more liberal trade and investment regimes.
