40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Pickup</b> and Delivery Problem (DPDP), a dynamic multi-stage {{vehicle routing problem}} in which each demand requires two spatially separated services: pickup service at its source location and then delivery service at its destination location. The <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Pickup</b> and Delivery Problem arises in many practical applications, including taxi and courier services, manufacturing and inventory routing, emergency services, mobile sensor networks, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) routing, and delay tolerant wireless networks. The main contribution of this thesis is the quantification of the delay performance of the <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Pickup</b> and Delivery Problem {{as a function of}} the number of vehicles, the total arrival rate of messages, the required message service times, the vehicle velocity, and the network area. Two lower bounds are derived. First, the Universal Lower Bound quantifies the impact of spatially separated service locations and system loading on average delay. The second lower bound is derived by reducing the two-stage <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Pickup</b> and Delivery Problem to the single-stage Dynamic Traveling Repairperson Problem (DTRP). Policies are then presented for which these lower bounds are tight {{as a function of the}} system scaling parameters (up to a constant). The impact of information and inter-vehicle relays is also studied. The last part of this thesis examines the application of the <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Pickup</b> and Delivery Problem to mobile multi-agent wireless networks from a physical layer perspective, seeking insights for the control of the network to achieve trade-offs between throughput and delay. by Holly A.

Although the company was based at Tonbridge in Kent, Crystalate made many of its recordings at the acoustically excellent town hall of West Hampstead in north west London. At first the company rented the hall, and was later able to buy the freehold for £1,250. During the 1930s Haddy gradually developed improved cutting heads and <b>dynamic</b> <b>pickups,</b> {{with the aim of}} widening the usable frequency range of his records. At that time, recordings were cut directly on wax, and the existing cutting heads were restricted to a bandwidth of about 50-8,000Hz. After experimenting with other techniques, Haddy opted for the moving-coil principle which Paul Voigt of Edison Bell and Alan Blumlein of EMI had separately advocated back in the 1920s. His first efforts were restricted to a 7,500Hz upper limit but the sound quality was nonetheless much improved. The repertoire recorded by Haddy for Crystalate was mainly light music and comedy records, with artists such as Sandy Powell, Charles Penrose, and Leslie Sarony.|$|R

Besides their computational hardness, such systems need {{to cope with}} the dynamic and distributed nature of the problems. This article describes an agent-based approach to the <b>dynamic</b> <b>pickup</b> and delivery problem (PDP). We investigate the feasibility of using the neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT) algorithm to create and optimize a multi-agent system (MAS) for dynamic PDPs. A thorough feasibility study requires a significant effort since a platform is required that facilitates a comparison of MAS and centralized algorithms. We implemented an existing benchmark dataset for the <b>dynamic</b> <b>pickup</b> and delivery problem with time windows (PDPTW) in the RinSim multi-agent simulator.

40|$|In the {{stochastic}} {{and dynamic}} multi-stage vehicle routing problem, {{a set of}} vehicles collectively transports and services demands which require service at multiple spatially separated locations. Arrival times and service locations of individual demands are not known until the demand’s arrival, and vehicles are assumed to have infinite capacity and to travel with bounded velocity. The objective is to define real-time control policies for the vehicles to service the demands such that average demand time-in-system is minimized. Such problems arise in numerous applications, including courier services, inventory routing, and mobile sensor networks. In this paper, we provide a general lower bound on the delay performance of a class of batching policies for the dynamic multi-stage vehicle routing problem. This requires us to overcome nontrivial technical difficulties presented by the non-work-conserving nature {{of the system and}} the service of multiple (possibly infinitely many) jobs simultaneously.

As a result the methodology and the plant for the investigation of the light scattering of aerosol systems, induced by an electric field, and for the calculation of density spectrums of the light scattering signal power have been developed and created as well as the equipment for the measurement of aerodisperse particle charges. The mechanism, explaining the spectrum features of the electrooptical light scattering signal power with the account of the variation of adsorption and ionic-electrostatic components of disjoining pressure, that leads to the electrostabilization and coagulation of particles, has been suggested. The asymmetry effect of field dependences of the electrooptical light scattering signal for different-polar charged aerosol particles has been estableshed experimentally for the first time.

40|$|Amazon {{is one of}} the world's largest {{retailers}} with {{revenues of}} $ 74. 5 billion in 2013 and 22 % growth over 2012. As Amazon continues to grow and offer greater selection, more products are flowing through an expanding inbound network. While this growth has added complexity for the inbound transportation organization, it has also created opportunities to reduce transportation cost and improve performance. Inbound transportation managed by Amazon currently represents 60 % of the company's inbound freight. For this freight, Amazon uses automated shipment-planning systems to select a carrier for all shipments. The systems run once per day, selecting carriers for a set of shipment requests where each vendor has specified a freight ready date of tomorrow. Several inputs are included to achieve a low transportation cost for the network, but the systems are constrained by the vendor's freight ready date. By introducing <b>dynamic</b> <b>pickup</b> windows based on when the freight is needed in the fulfillment centers (FCs), Amazon has the opportunity to reduce transportation cost and mitigate out-of-stock occurrences. A current state analysis revealed that approximately 70 % of Amazon's freight was shipped through expensive less-than-truckload and small-parcel methods. While truckload shipments are ideal in transportation, ordering smaller lots more frequently is preferable to maintain high in-stock levels in the FCs while keeping inventory holding costs low. Therefore, Amazon's shipment-planning systems minimize transportation cost by building multi-stop routes to pick up smaller shipments from several vendors before delivering to the FC. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>pickup</b> window solution changes the planning process by relaxing the constraint of tendering a shipment today to a high cost transportation mode if that freight does not need to ship today. If shipment requests are not tendered today and instead sent to tomorrow's pool of requests, two types of consolidation can occur: (1) a single-vendor consolidation and (2) a multi-vendor consolidation. A model was developed to simulate shipment planning on the entire network for one week, resulting in a 2 % transportation cost reduction and 4 % fewer shipments while protecting in-stock levels. Amazon piloted in late 2013 with success and plans to implement throughout the network in early 2014. While the <b>dynamic</b> <b>pickup</b> window solution is presented with Amazon as the case study, the solution is applicable to any business with stochastic demand and lead time, a large vendor base, and control of managing its inbound transportation. by Charles R Cummings, III.

40|$|Abstract. In the <b>dynamic</b> <b>Pickup</b> and Delivery Problem with Transfers (dPDPT), {{a set of}} {{transportation}} requests that arrive at arbitrary times must be assigned to a fleet of vehicles. We use two cost metrics that cap-ture both the company’s and the customer’s viewpoints regarding the quality of an assignment. In most related problems, {{the rule of thumb}} is to apply a two-phase local search algorithm to heuristically determine a good requests-to-vehicles assignment. This work proposes a novel solu-tion based on a graph-based formulation of the problem that treats each request independently. Briefly, in this conceptual graph, the goal is to find a shortest path from a node representing the pickup location to that of the delivery location. However, we show that efficient Bellman-Ford or Dijkstra-like algorithms cannot be applied. Still, our method is able to find dPDPT solutions significantly faster than a conventional two-phase local search algorithm, while the cost of the solution is only marginally increased. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a hybrid adaptive predictive control approach to incorporate future information regarding unknown demand and expected traffic conditions, {{in the context}} of a <b>dynamic</b> <b>pickup</b> and delivery problem with fixed fleet size. As the routing problem is dynamic, several stochastic effects have to be considered within the analytical expression of the dispatcher assignment decision objective function. This paper is focused on two issues: one is the extra cost associated with potential rerouting arising from unknown requests in the future, and the other is the potential uncertainty in travel time coming from non-recurrent traffic congestion from unexpected incidents. These effects are incorporated explicitly in the objective function of the hybrid predictive controller. In fact, the proposed predictive control strategy is based on a multivariable model that includes both discrete/integer and continuous variables. The vehicle load and the sequence of stops correspond to the discrete/integer variable, adding the vehicle position as an indicator of the traffic congestion conditions. The strategy is analyzed under two scenarios. The first one considers a predictable congestion obtained using historical data (off-line method) requiring a predictive model of velocities distributed over zones. The second scenario that accepts unpredictable congestion events generates a more complex problem that is managed by using both fault detection and isolation and fuzzy fault-tolerant control approaches. Results validating these approaches are presented through a simulated numerical example...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{transport}} requirements in modern society {{are becoming more}} and more important. Thus, offered transport services need to be more and more ad-vanced and better designed to meet users demands. Important cost factors of many goods are transport costs. Therefore, a reduction of costs, a better adjustment of strategies to the demand as well as a better planning and scheduling of avail-able resources are important for the transport companies. This paper is aimed at modelling and simulation of transport systems, involving a <b>dynamic</b> <b>Pickup</b> and De-livery problem with Time Windows and capacity constraints (PDPTW). PDPTW is defined by a set of transport requests which should be performed while mini-mising costs expressed by the number of vehicles, total distance and total travel time. Each request is described by two locations: pickup and delivery, periods of time when the operations of pickup or delivery can be performed and a load to be transported. The nature of this problem, its distribution and the possibility of using a lot of autonomous planning modules, lead us to use a multi-agent approach. Our approach allows the modeling of entities which do not appear in the classical PDPTW such as company organisation, communication among vehicles, interac-tions between vehicles and company dispatcher or different strategies of requests 278 J.

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} a network {{in which a}} set of n vehicles, each traveling with velocity ≤ v, is responsible for picking up and delivering messages that arrive according to Poisson process with rate λ(n). Message pickup and delivery locations are distributed in a convex region A uniformly at random. The vehicles are required to pickup and deliver the messages so that the average delay is minimized. In this paper, the vehicle that picks up a message must {{be the one to}} deliver it. We call this problem the <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Pickup</b> and Delivery Problem (DPDP). In this paper, we consider control policies that are separable into two parts: πA, an assignment policy used by a centralized controller to assign arriving messages to the vehicles for service, and πS, a service policy used by each vehicle to determine the service routes through its assigned messages. We provide lower bounds on the delay achievable by separable control policies π = (πA, πS) that depend on the information constraint in place. We prove that the optimal average delay scaling can be reduced when message destination information is available to the centralized controller in addition to the message source information. Finally we provide policies that achieve these scaling bounds, proving that these bounds are tight. This control problem is strongly related to previous work in dynamic vehicle routing and has important applications in the context of autonomous vehicles and wireless ad hoc networks. I...|$|E
40|$|<b>Dynamic</b> <b>pickup</b> and {{delivery}} problems (PDPs) require online algorithms for managing {{a fleet of}} vehicles. Generally, vehicles can be managed either centrally or decentrally. A common way to coordinate agents decentrally {{is to use the}} contract-net protocol (CNET) that uses auctions to allocate tasks among agents. To participate in an auction, agents require a method that estimates the value of a task. Typically this method is an optimization algorithm. Recently, hyper-heuristics has been proposed for automated design of heuristics. Two properties of automatically designed heuristics are particularly promising: 1) a generated heuristic computes quickly, it is expected therefore that hyper-heuristics heuristics perform especially well for urgent problems, and 2) by using simulationbased evaluation, hyper-heuristics can learn from the past and can therefore create a ‘rule of thumb’ that anticipates situations in the future. In the present paper we empirically evaluate whether hyper-heuristics, more specifically genetic programming (GP), can be used to improve agents decentrally coordinated via CNET. We compare several GP settings and compare the resulting heuristic with existing centralized and decentralized algorithms on a dynamic PDP dataset with varying levels of dynamism, urgency, and scale. The results indicate that the evolved heuristic always outperforms the optimization algorithm in the decentralized MAS and often outperforms the centralized optimization algorithm. Our paper shows that designing MASs using genetic programming is an effective way to obtain competitive performance compared to traditional operational research approaches. These results strengthen the relevance of decentralized agent based approaches in dynamic logistics...|$|E

Access to transportation-related features—mobile payment systems, Global Positioning System connections, real-time public transit timetables or traffic congestion information, and so on—is easy.

The dynamic model represents the behavior of the ridesharing system and computes the relevant performance; the optimization problem finds the best match and path in the considered transportation network to minimize the difference between the desired departure and arrival times. In this paper, after the introduction of the ridesharing model, the discussion of the solution to the optimal matching problem, a simulation model is described. A real world case study is then presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis concerns the problem of dynamic vehicle routing. The motivation {{for this is the}} increasing demands on transportation services to deliver fast, efficient and reliable service. Systems are now needed for dispatching transportation requests that arrive dynamically throughout the scheduling horizon. Therefore the focus of this research is the <b>dynamic</b> <b>pickup</b> and delivery problem with time windows, where requests are not completely known in advance but become available during the scheduling horizon. All requests have to be satisfied by a given fleet of vehicles and each request has a pickup and delivery location, along with a time window at which services can take place. To solve the DPDPTW, our algorithm is embedded in a rolling horizon framework, thus allowing the problem to be viewed as a series of static sub-problems. This research begins by considering the static variant of the problem. Both heuristic and metaheuristic methods are applied and an analysis is performed across a range of well-known instances. Results competitive with {{the state of the art}} are obtained. For the dynamic problem, investigations are performed to identify how requests arriving dynamically should be incorporated into the solution. Varying degrees of urgency and proportions of dynamic requests have been examined. Further investigations look at improving the solutions over time and identifying appropriate improvement heuristics. Again competitive results are achieved across a range of instances from the literature. This continually increasing area of research covers many real-life problems such as a health courier service. Here, the problem consists of the pickup and delivery of mail, specimens and equipment between hospitals, GP surgeries and health centres. Final research applies our findings to a real-life example of this problem, both for static schedules and a real-time 24 / 7 service...|$|E
