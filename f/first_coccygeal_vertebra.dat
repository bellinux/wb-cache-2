40|$|There are 27 verebrae {{between the}} head and the sacrum. With the {{exception}} of the first two, these vertebrae are separated from each other by intervertebral discs which are very closely connected to the vertebral bodies. Immediately dorsal to the vertebral bodies is the vertebral canal which houses the spinal cord and its investing membranes. Between the outermost of these membranes (dura mater) and the vertebral bodies, is the dorsal longitudinal ligament which starts at the odontoid process of the second cervical vertebrae and ends at the body of the <b>first</b> <b>coccygeal</b> <b>vertebrae.</b> As it passes over each intervertebral disc it expands laterally and blends with the disc tissue.

40|$|Rabbit bulbourethral glands are {{a compact}} structure, {{surrounded}} by the skeletal M. bulboglandularis and a fibrous capsule. The glands have a cubic shape and are located on the dorsal urethral wall in craniocaudal direction. It is connected with prostate and paraprostate by a connective tissue. Ten sexually mature healthy male white New Zealand rabbits, 12 months old weighed 2. 8 - 3. 2 kg were investigated. The animals were anesthetized with 15 mg kg - 1 Zoletil ® 50. Scans were done at 2 mm intervals and the image reconstruction was three-dimensional. The cuts were cranially limited between {{the body of the}} ischium behind the acetabulum (laterally) {{and the end of the}} ischial part of pubic symphysis (ventrally) and the <b>first</b> <b>coccygeal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> (cg 1) (dorsally) and caudally-from the body of ischium, cranially to tuber ischiadicum (laterally), the ischial arch (ventrally) and the edge of the second <b>coccygeal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> (cg 2). Rabbit bulbourethral glands were observed as a transversely oval homogeneous, relatively hyperdense structure against the surrounding soft tissues. They are visualized in the transverse cut of the pelvic outlet in the plane through the cranial part of cg 2 (dorsally), the body of ischium, cranially to tuber ischiadicum (laterally) and dorsally to the caudal part of symphysis pubis-sciatic arch. The glandular margins are adequately distinguished from the adjacent soft tissue structures. The density of the rabbit bulbourethral glands was similar to this of the soft tissues (34 ± 0. 53 HU in native scan and up to 60 ± 91 HU in contrast-enhanced scan). The width of the glands (lateral dimension) was 6. 1 ± 0. 29 mm, its height (dorsoventral dimension) was 5. 4 ± 0. 22 mm and the length (craniocaudal dimension) was 7. 8 ± 0. 38 mm. The data obtained by the computed tomographic imaging of the rabbit bulbourethral glands could be used as an anatomical reference in the diagnosis and interpretation of imaging findings of various pathological states of the gland in this species, as well as in utilization of the rabbit as an animal model for studying diseases of this organ in humans, particularly diverticula, stenosis, lithiasis and valves...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was the imaging and {{determination}} of some anatomical features of pelvic urethra in male cats using computed axial tomography (CAT). The study was performed on 7 sexually mature European shorthair male cats under anaesthesia and aged between 1 and 2 years and weighing 2. 8 − 4 kg. The positive contrast (Ultravist 300) was applied intravenously and transurethrally to 5 of these animals whilst the other 2 had no contrast applied. The study was performed on a computed tomograph TOMOSCAN – CX/Q. The pelvis was scanned transversally from the transverse plane between the <b>first</b> and second <b>coccygeal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> to the plane between the third and fourth <b>coccygeal</b> <b>vertebrae.</b> The thickness of cuts and the distance between them was 2 mm. The pelvic urethra of the male cat was depicted during the scan of the pelvis from the cranial part of 2 nd to the caudal part of the 3 rd <b>coccygeal</b> <b>vertebrae.</b> The urethra was depicted as a tubular, heterogeneous, relatively hyperdense finding with a soft tissue density and hyper- or hypodense lumen during both contrast and native investigation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In male cattle, rupture of the {{urinary bladder}} is usually {{associated}} with urethral obstruction by uroliths. Less common causes include urethral compression or stricture. This case report describes the findings in a young Limousion breeding bull with rupture of the urinary bladder because of urethral compression by a haematoma after coccygeal fracture. CASE PRESENTATION: The bull had been introduced into a 40 -head Red-Holstein herd one week before being injured. One week after introduction to the herd, the bull had an acute onset of anorexia and he was referred to the clinic. There was marked abdominal distension, reduced skin turgor and enophthalmus. The serum concentration of urea and creatinine was increased. Ultrasonographic examination revealed severe ascites and abdominocentesis yielded clear yellow fluid with high urea and creatinine concentrations, which supported a diagnosis of uroperitoneum. The bull was euthanatized because of a poor prognosis. Postmortem examination revealed a comminuted fracture of the <b>first</b> two <b>coccygeal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> associated with a massive haematoma that obstructed entire pelvic cavity. The haematoma compressed the urethra thereby preventing outflow of urine, {{which resulted in a}} 5 -cm tear ventrally at the neck of the bladder. It was assumed that the newly-introduced bull had sustained the vertebral fractures when he was mounted by a cow. CONCLUSIONS: The present case study serves to expand the differential diagnosis of urinary bladder rupture. Therefore, in addition to obstructive urolithiasis, compression and stricture of the urethra might be considered in male cattle with uroperitoneum...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} osteogenic {{potential}} of cancellous bone of conventional graft sites {{with that of}} one nonconventional site (fourth <b>coccygeal</b> <b>vertebra)</b> and to investigate the tibial periosteum as a donor site with respect to osteogenic potential. STUDY DESIGN: In vitro osteogenic cell culture system. SAMPLE POPULATION: Eight adult horses. METHODS: Cancellous bone or tibial periosteum was aseptically collected and cut into bone chips or periosteal strips of 1 to 2 mm(3) for primary explant cultures. After 2 weeks, primary tissue cultures that yielded a population of osteogenic cells were counted and subcultured at 1 x 10 (5) cells/ 35 -mm dish in osteogenic media. After 7 to 10 days, subcultures were stained with Von Kossa (VK) to assess mineralized bone nodule formation. VK-positive bone nodules were counted as osteoprogenitors and compared among 3 donor sites, which provided consistent primary osteogenic cells (tuber coxae, fourth <b>coccygeal</b> <b>vertebra,</b> periosteum) using ANOVA (P <. 05). RESULTS: Sternal and tibial bone yielded viable osteogenic cells from 25 % and 50 % of horses, respectively, whereas yields from tuber coxae, <b>coccygeal</b> <b>vertebra,</b> and periosteum were 75 %, 100 %, and 100 %, respectively. Tuber coxae and periosteum had significantly greater numbers of osteoprogenitors compared with fourth <b>coccygeal</b> <b>vertebra.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Among the conventional donor sites, tuber coxae most consistently yielded viable osteogenic cells with an acceptable percentage of osteoprogenitors. Sternal and tibial sites were unreliable in providing osteogenic cells.

40|$|The {{specific}} gravities (SG) of bone {{samples taken}} from {{various parts of}} the skeleton of cattle and sheep were determined gravimetrically in an effort to establish which sites give the most reproducible and uniform results, so that between animals, or sequential within animals, comparisons may be made with maximum sensitivity. Samples obtained from the mandible of sheep and the rib of cattle and sheep were found to be too variable to be useful for most purposes. Best results were obtained using whole bones which are easily prepared, such as the tibial tarsal bones of cattle and sheep and the fibular tarsal bone of cattle. These bones gave within animal deviations of 0. 012 - 0. 024 SG units, when comparing left bone with right bone. Slightly higher values were obtained for <b>coccygeal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> from cattle and distal metacarpal condyles from sheep. SG was related to ash, calcium and phosphorus contents of <b>coccygeal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> of cattle and it is considered that, for survey work on the mineral status of the bones of cattle and sheep, the correlations are sufficiently high to make their determination unnecessary.

40|$|The sacral and <b>coccygeal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> at 8 postovulatory weeks (the {{end of the}} {{embryonic}} period proper) {{have been}} studied by means of graphic reconstructions. The cartilaginous sacrum is now a definitive unit composed of five separable vertebrae, each of which consists of a future centrum and bilateral neural processes. The base of each neural process consists of an anterolateral or alar element, not present in the lumbar region, and a posterolateral part, which includes costal and transverse elements. The usual illustrations, in which the costal component {{is placed in the}} alar element, are incorrect. The future dorsal foramina (containing dorsal rami) face laterally in the embryo and are in line with the thoracicolumbar intervertebral foramina. Considerable differential growth is required to change the dorsal openings from a lateral to a dorsal positions. The intervertebral foramina transmit ventral rami, but pelvic foramina are not yet present. The lumbosacral plexus is completed by S. N. 1 - 3; S. N. 4, 5 and Co. N. 1 form the pelvic plexus. The inferior hypogastric plexus and the hypogastric nerves are present. The sacrum takes part in the spina bifida occulta that characterises {{the entire length of the}} embryonic vertebral column. The <b>coccygeal</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> which are variable, were 4 - 6 in number in the present series. The first is the best developed. The ventriculus terminalis ends usually at the level of Co.

50|$|The lateral {{borders are}} thin and exhibit {{a series of}} small eminences, which {{represent}} the transverse processes of the <b>coccygeal</b> <b>vertebrae.</b> Of these, the first is the largest; it is flattened from before backward, and often ascends to join {{the lower part of the}} thin lateral edge of the sacrum, thus completing the foramen for the transmission of the anterior division of the fifth sacral nerve; the others diminish in size from above downward, and are often wanting. The borders of the coccyx are narrow, and give attachment on either side to the sacrotuberous and sacrospinous ligaments, to the coccygeus in front of the ligaments, and to the gluteus maximus behind them.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: This study {{aimed to}} {{describe}} the dorsal origin of the cutaneus trunci muscle (CTM) especially focusing on the attachment manner to the tail. METHODS: The CTM consisted of the humeroabdominalis muscle (HAM) and humerodorsalis muscle (HDM). The dorsal origin of the HDM was divided into three parts: scapular, intermediate, and caudal. The muscle fibers which attached to the tail were derived from the caudal part. They attached to the spinous process and transverse process of the <b>coccygeal</b> <b>vertebra,</b> dorsal <b>coccygeal</b> fascia, and intervertebral ligament at the Co 3 -Co 4 level.
