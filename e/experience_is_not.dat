5|$|Even {{people with}} {{complete}} SCI, in whom {{the spinal cord}} cannot transmit any messages past {{the level of the}} lesion, can achieve orgasm. In 1960, in one of the earliest studies to look at orgasm and SCI, the term phantom orgasm was coined to describe women's perception of orgasmic sensations despite SCI—but subsequent studies have suggested the <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> merely psychological. Men with complete SCI report sexual sensations at the time of ejaculation, accompanied by physical signs normally found at orgasm, such as increased blood pressure. Women can experience orgasm with vibration to the cervix regardless of level or completeness of injury; the sensation is the same as uninjured women experience.|$|E

25|$|Stories tend to {{be based}} on experiential {{learning}}, but learning from an <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> automatic. Often a person needs to attempt {{to tell the story of}} that experience before realizing its value. In this case, it is not only the listener who learns, but the teller who also becomes aware of his or her own unique experiences and background. This process of storytelling is empowering as the teller effectively conveys ideas and, with practice, is able to demonstrate the potential of human accomplishment. Storytelling taps into existing knowledge and creates bridges both culturally and motivationally toward a solution.|$|E
25|$|Mystical <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{simply a}} matter between the mystic and God, but is often shaped by {{cultural}} issues. For instance, Caroline Bynum has shown how, in the late Middle Ages, miracles attending the taking of the Eucharist were not simply symbolic of the Passion story, but served as vindication of the mystic's theological orthodoxy by proving that the mystic had not fallen prey to heretical ideas, such as the Cathar rejection of the material world as evil, contrary to orthodox teaching that God took on human flesh and remained sinless. Thus, the nature of mystical experience could be tailored to the particular cultural and theological issues of the time.|$|E
25|$|Aristotle also {{includes}} in {{his theory of}} dreams what constitutes a dream and what does not. He claimed that a dream is first established {{by the fact that}} the person is asleep when they experience it. If a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred. Secondly, any sensory experience that actually occurs while a person is asleep and is perceived by the person while asleep does not qualify as part of a dream. For example, if, while a person is sleeping, a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut, Aristotle argues that this sensory <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> part of the dream. The actual sensory experience is perceived by the senses, the fact that it occurred while the person was asleep does not make it part of the dream. Lastly, the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of sensory experiences had when awake.|$|E

2500|$|According to Timo Eskola, early Christian {{theology}} and discourse {{was influenced by}} the Jewish Merkabah tradition. [...] Similarly, Alan Segal and Daniel Boyarin regard Paul the Apostle's accounts of his conversion experience and his ascent to the heavens as the earliest first person accounts we have of a Merkabah mystic in Jewish or Christian literature. Timothy Churchill has argued that Paul's Damascus road encounter does not fit the pattern of Merkabah, but this <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> described in Paul's letters, and Acts does not claim to be a first-person account.|$|E

Cave diving is normally taught in stages, each successive stage focusing on more complex aspects of cave diving.

Accident analysis of cave diving fatalities has shown [...] that academic training without sufficient real world <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> always enough {{in the event of an}} underwater emergency. By systematically building experience the diver can develop the confidence, motor skills and reflexes to remain calm and apply the appropriate procedures in an emergency.

[...] <b>Experience</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a source but a medium through which the sources speak.

2500|$|Implicit {{memories}} of stimuli {{do not require}} conscious recollection of the initial encounter of the stimulus. In regards to olfactory memory, deliberate recollection of an odor <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> necessary in order for implicit {{memories of}} odors to form in the brain. [...] Techniques used to study implicit olfactory memory {{are considered to be}} applicable to both humans and animals. [...] In tests of implicit memory, memory of a stimulus is shown to be aided by previous exposure to that same stimulus. [...] Evidence of the formation of implicit memory is found in tests of habituation, sensitization, perceptual learning and classical conditioning. [...] In olfaction there exists a strong tendency for habituation, which is discussed further in the following paragraph. [...] By evaluating memory performance of tasks involving one of these ‘subsets’ of implicit memory, the effect of previous odor stimulus experience not involving conscious recollection can be measured. Further knowledge can be gained about implicit memory of odor through the study of the implications of cognitive deficits. The effects of brain injury on odor memory can be investigated through the use of these implicit memory measures leading to further overall understanding of the brain.|$|E
