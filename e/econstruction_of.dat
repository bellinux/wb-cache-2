40|$|The {{following}} two duties are expected of us: (1) {{to assist in}} interpretation of diagnostic images, and (2) to provide detailed explanations of radiological examinations. As professionals, {{we owe it to}} our clients to maintain our competence in perceiving the reality of each person’s condition during radiological examinations; we must neither nderestimate their radiation exposure risks nor overestimate the benefits they may receive from the examination. When assisting in interpretation of diagnostic images, we must understand the characteristics of images that can affect our assessment. Moreover, turning to the topic of reconstructed images, much information can be gathered from images utilizing the full capability <b>of</b> <b>econstruction</b> algorithms. Image quality is highly dependent upon the method of reconstruction (calculation of tomographic images). Reconstruction can be broadly classified into the {{following two}} types: filtered back projection and iterative reconstruction. 「久保直樹著：フィルタ補正逆投影法・逐次近似法について、START, 48, p. 13 - 15 (2012) 」の英訳...|$|R

40|$|Reconstruction from {{projections}} has revolutionized radiology and as {{now become}} one of the most important tools of medical diagnosi- he E. M. I. Scanner is one example. In this text, some fundamental heoretical and practical questions are resolved. Despite recent research activity in the area, the crucial subject ·f the uniqueness of the reconstruction and the effect of noise in the ata posed some unsettled fundamental questions. In particular, Kennan mith proved that if we describe an object by a C~ function, i. e., nfinitely differentiable with compact support, then there are other bjects with the same shape, i. e., support, which can differ almost rhitrarily and still have the same projections in finitely many direc­ ions. On the other hand, he proved that objects in finite dimensional unction spaces are uniquely determined by a single projection for almost 11 angles, i. e., except on a set of measure zero. Along these lines, erman and Rowland in [41) showed that reconstructions obtained from he commonly used algorithms can grossly misrepresent the object and hat the algorithm which produced the best reconstruction when using oiseless data gave unsatisfactory results with noisy data. Equally mportant are reports in Science, [67, 68) and personal communications y radiologists indicating that in medical practice failure rates <b>of</b> <b>econstruction</b> vary from four to twenty percent. within this work, the mathematical dilemma posed by Kennan Smith's esult is discussed and clarified...|$|R
40|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging method, {{which allows}} the <b>econstruction</b> <b>of</b> three dimensional depth-resolved images with microscale resolution. Originally developed for biomedical diagnostics, nowadays it also shows a high potential for applications {{in the field of}} non-destructive testing (NDT). This work demonstrates how OCT could help to investigate the delamination growth in fiber composites. A customized OCT system was built with a near-infrared light source with center wavelength at 1550 nm. It was used as an inline NDT tool to monitor the crack tips and image the crack surfaces within a glass fiber composite under static loading. For carbon fiber composites, although it is difficult to acquire the internal structures due to their opaque property, OCT can still work as a surface profilometer to reconstruct 3 D crack surface profiles, providing substantial information for the study of crack growth in the composites.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we introduce, define and quantitatively assess the {{stability}} of the algorithms for the <b>econstruction</b> <b>of</b> networks. We will focus on theory, development and implementation of operative procedures and algorithms for the assessment of stability in complex networks for biological systems, with gene regulatory networks as the key example. A major issue affecting network inference is indeed the high variability of network reconstruction and network topology inferred after data perturbation, different parameter choices and alternative methods. Network stability will thus be used to measure reliability of inferred topology, also obtaining confidence intervals for the outcomes. The methods will be employed to introduce a new approach to reproducibility in the study of complex networks. It will also be coupled with statistical machine learning models, in order to integrate feature selection and network inference within a pathway profiling approach. The evaluation of similarity between networks will be the first and central operative procedure of the developed pipelines, the key point being the identification of distances that can compare network structures improving over classical measures based on the confusion matrix, too coarse for this task. A combination of spectral and edit distances especially tailored for biological networks will be investigated and applied to several high-throughput biological datasets of different nature and with different tasks in oncogenomics, neurogenomics and exposomics...|$|E
40|$|Increasingly. {{psychoanalysis}} has {{confronted the}} issue of recovered memories of childhood trauma. Based on trauma research, the con-cept of a special traumatic memory has evolved. Overwhelming psy-chic experience is thought to generate a defensively {{altered state of consciousness}} (specifically dissociation), which encodes memory in unassimilated visual, somatic, and behavioral. rather than linguistic modes. Analytic reevocation and interpretation of the original af-tered states of consciousness then permits the transformation of “early ” traumatic memory into “later ” explicit memory. Examined {{from the vantage point of}} contemporary cognitive research and the-ory, underlying flaws may be found in these propositions when they are extended to patients without explicit memory of trauma: first, dissociation is a chameleonlike process, perhaps as closely associated with suggestibility as with trauma; second, state-dependent learning does not adequately account for the absence of explicit memory; and third, implicit memory does not map onto explicit memory in any direct or simple fashion. Consequently, the clinical application of current propositions about traumatic memory to patients without explicit memory of trauma may warrant considerable caution. Provi-sional guidelines are offered for estimating the validity of retrieved memories of trauma. <b>econstruction</b> <b>of</b> earlier events, circumstances, and experi- R ences has always been an integral facet of psychoanalytic practice. Over time, the nature of what has been reconstructed has shifted from suspected early sexual trauma (Freud, 1896) to more atmospheric afllective and ego states (Wetzler, 1985) and, most recently, back to suspected sexual trauma. Subtle trends are also visible within these shifts. For example, recon-structions relating to sexual events now appear to lean towar...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{evaluate}} the intriguing and relevant relationship between UI and FSD in urological practice. This relationship is addressed from anatomical, clinical and health care points of view. The initial question was whether urologists should {{play a role in}} sexual health care of women with urinary incontinence. In chapter 2, three-dimensional anatomical <b>econstructions</b> and results <b>of</b> dissection in cadavers are described. The reconstructions illustrate the clitoral innervation in order to deduce its anatomical relationship to other pelvic structures. This is important to preserve clitoral nerves during pelvic surgery. Furthermore, this chapter evaluates the possible effects of incontinence surgery from an anatomical point of view, especially with regards to the nerves important for sexual function. In chapter 3, sexual function is evaluated among women after a sling procedure. This study attempts to clarify the impact of surgery for stress urinary incontinence on female sexual function. In addition, the relevance of the presence of preoperative coital incontinence is discussed extensively. Chapter 4 discusses the impact of female urinary incontinence on the sexual relationship with male partners. The chapters 5 and 6 overview practices, attitudes and believes of Dutch urologists towards FSD and sexual abuse. Chapter 7 analyses how Dutch incontinence nurses deal with sexuality and sexual abuse in their daily practice. Finally, chapter 8 provides a ‘helicopter view’ on data of this of this thesis followed by a discussion on future prospects. Promotores: A. A. B. Lycklama à Nijeholt, R. C. M. Pelger, Co-promotor: H.

40|$|Compared {{with other}} {{locations}} on the face, skin {{cancer of the}} midface has {{a higher risk of}} recurrence owing, in part, to the mode of spread and the high frequency of subclinical extension. Skin cancers occurring in the re-gion of the melolabial crease, nasal columella and medial canthus should be resected by Mohs surgery. Because tumors of the midface are sometimes re-calcitrant, there are times when surgical ablation re-sults in extensive defects. Reconstruction may be difi-cult owing to lack of available donor tissue, or because of previous surgery {{in the area of the}} proposed donor region. In these circumstances, tissue expansion in the form of controlled prolonged expansion or rapid intra-operative expansion, may, on occasion, provide the op-timal reconstruction of form and function. J Dermatol Surg Oncol 1994; 20 : 133 - 140. <b>econstruction</b> <b>of</b> the midface is a challenging problem because of complex topographical anatomy, as well as the vital functions per- R formed by the facial structures within this re-gion. The midface includes the upper lip, entire nose, central forehead and medial canthal region. Most defects of the midface that require reconstruction result from the need to excise skin cancers. Skin cancer is the most com-mon form of malignancy in man, and the midface is the most common location. ' Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the predominant histological type. Fortunately, the mortality rate from BCC is negligible, but its morbidity can be sig-nificant when such tumors involve midface structures and are not treated early and properly. In the case of BCC, tumor histology is correlated with the frequency of recur...|$|E
40|$|We {{present results}} from an ongoing {{research}} programme in the Sneeuberg and Coetzeesberg ranges of the Eastern Cape, South Africa. The programme {{has focused on}} the <b>econstruction</b> <b>of</b> sediment yields from Cs- 137 and Pb- 210 dated deposits accumulating in small farm reservoirs. A number of tracers were used to determine whether changes in sediment yield were associated with changes in catchment connectivity and / or sediment sources in two of these small (< 60 km- 2) catchments. The analysis presented here compares the response of a steep upland catchment (Ganora; in the Sneeuberg) that has extensive badland development with that of a lower altitude catchment (Cranemere; located on a gently sloping plain south of the Coetzeesberg) that has limited badland development and significant internal sediment storage (alluvial fans and flood-outs). Results show that average sediment yields were higher by almost an order of magnitude in the Ganora catchment but increased significantly {{in the latter half of}} the 20 th Century in both catchments. The exact timing of these increases was different in each of the two catchments as were the factors controlling sediment delivery to the reservoirs. At Ganora, a change in sediment source and small increases in sediment yield appear to have been initially driven by the development of badlands in the 1930 s. More significant increases in sediment yield and a sustained change in sediment source was maintained by improved connectivity between the badlands and the main channel network in the 1960 s. At Cranemere, increased connectivity between the two contributing sub-catchments and the reservoir occurred as a result of the construction of a causeway to carry a main road and by the construction of culverts beneath the road in the early 1950 s, permanently improving the connectivity between the contributing catchments and the dam. Occasional changes in sediment source have also been identified in the sedimentary record at Cranemere but these are not linked directly to road construction but to sediment that is most likely derived from the much smaller eastern tributary 40 catchment. Our analysis has also explored the possible impacts of land use change (especially stocking density) and changes in the magnitude and frequency of daily rainfall in order to help explain some of the trends observed. Research to date shows the complexity of sediment delivery in these semi-arid catchment systems and emphasises the need to combine sediment yield reconstruction with sediment source tracing in order to better understand the dynamics of these systems...|$|E
40|$|This thesis essays a compar ative {{study of}} William Pl omer's Turbott Wolfe (1925) and Sol Plaatje's Mhudi (1930). Although writing from very {{different}} subject positions wit hi n the socia l {{order of the}} time, Plomer and Plaatje embody in their novels a striki ngly s i mil ar visi on of a South Africa free of racial barriers. Plaatje's version of South African history in Mhudi deconstructs colonial bi narism by dramati z ing not only conflic t and difference but a l so co-operation and commonality. Holding the past up as a mirror to the pr esent, it protests agai nst racial injustice while implying the continuing possibilit y of reconciliation. Plomer reacts angrily to white hypocrisy and i nsists on the rights and humanity of his African characters, {{in the name of}} imperatives both moral and political. He seeks addi tional sanction for t hese by s i tuating the South Af rican race question i n the cont ext of a Western world s l owl y awake ni ng t o t he consequences of modernity. During a time of poli t ical t urbulence, both writer s speak out boldly and confidently against the r isi ng dominance of segregationist ideology. The imminent inception of full democracy in Sout h Afri ca has r eanimated the relevance of these writers' vision of a ' non- racial social order. If one of t he chall e nges facing the Sout h African l i t erary hi storian 'today i s t he r <b>econstruction</b> <b>of</b> a truly national l iterary tradi t ion, then Mhudi and Turbott Wolfe would appear to be key works in such an enterprise. As di fferent as iii Plaatje's epic myth-maki ng is from Plomer's modernist irony, both novels contrive to speak with a new voice: a national voice which expresses the aspirations of all South Africa ' s people. They are, moreover, novels whose survival seems guaranteed as much by their aesthetic qualities as by their ideological orientation. The novels are examined against the backgrounds of South African society and colonial literary production. They are seen as milestones i n the development of a liberal South African l iterary t r adition. By breaking with the dominant opposit ional mode, whether that of "white writi ng" or an emergent "writing black", Plomer and Pl aatje exemplify a literature at once socially relevant and possessed of a prophe'tic vision that remains of significance in South Africa today...|$|E
