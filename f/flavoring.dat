5|$|That hops {{could be}} used for <b>flavoring</b> beer had been known at least since Carolingian times, but was adopted {{gradually}} due to difficulties in establishing the appropriate proportions. Before the widespread use of hops, gruit, a mix of various herbs, had been used. Gruit had the same preserving properties as hops, though less reliable depending on what herbs were in it, and the end result was much more variable. Another <b>flavoring</b> method was to increase the alcohol content, but this was more expensive and lent the beer the undesired characteristic of being a quick and heavy intoxicant. Hops may have been widely used in England in the tenth century; they were grown in Austria by 1208 and in Finland by 1249, and possibly much earlier.|$|E
30|$|The {{sweet and}} salty <b>flavor</b> was {{compared}} with the original non-flavor to understand if Chinese consumers prefer original pistachio to the <b>flavored</b> alternatives. The original <b>flavor</b> is significantly preferred to the sweet <b>flavor,</b> {{as suggested by the}} negative coefficient of the Sweet <b>Flavor</b> variable. Though the salty <b>flavor</b> is not significantly preferred to the original <b>flavor,</b> both salty- and original- <b>flavored</b> are more attractive than the sweet <b>flavored</b> pistachios.|$|R
50|$|<b>Flavors</b> (and its {{successor}} New <b>Flavors)</b> was {{the object}} {{system on the}} MIT Lisp Machine. Large parts of the Lisp Machine operating systems and many applications for it use <b>Flavors</b> or New <b>Flavors.</b> <b>Flavors</b> introduced multiple inheritance and mixins, amongst other features. <b>Flavors</b> is mostly obsolete, though implementations for Common Lisp do exist. <b>Flavors</b> was using the message passing paradigm. New <b>Flavors</b> introduced generic functions.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Flavor</b> enhancers : <b>Flavor</b> enhancers enhance a food's {{existing}} <b>flavors.</b> A popular {{example is}} monosodium glutamate. Some <b>flavor</b> enhancers {{have their own}} <b>flavors</b> that are independent of the food.|$|R
5|$|Schneider {{left the}} St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 2005, {{arriving}} at the Baltimore Sun. While at the Sun, he began an investigative series into the use of diacetyl as a food <b>flavoring</b> for consumer products like microwave popcorn. The chemical {{was found to have}} been causing lung-related diseases in workers at plants, including Bronchiolitis obliterans ("popcorn lung"), and, according to Schneider, put professional cooks at risk. The investigation resulted in greater recognition of diacetyl's hazards by the public, resulting in a reduction or elimination in its use by manufacturers like ConAgra.|$|E
5|$|Salt {{is present}} in most foods, but in {{naturally}} occurring foodstuffs such as meats, vegetables and fruit, it {{is present in}} very small quantities. It is often added to processed foods (such as canned foods and especially salted foods, pickled foods, and snack foods or other convenience foods), where it functions as both a preservative and a <b>flavoring.</b> Dairy salt {{is used in the}} preparation of butter and cheese products. Before the advent of electrically powered refrigeration, salting {{was one of the main}} methods of food preservation. Thus, herring contains 67mg sodium per 100g, while kipper, its preserved form, contains 990mg. Similarly, pork typically contains 63mg while bacon contains 1,480mg, and potatoes contain 7mg but potato crisps 800mg per 100 g. The main sources of salt in the diet, apart from direct use of sodium chloride, are bread and cereal products, meat products and milk and dairy products.|$|E
25|$|Vanilla was {{cultivated}} as a <b>flavoring</b> by pre-Columbian Mesoamerican people; at {{the time}} of their conquest by Hernán Cortés, the Aztecs used it as a <b>flavoring</b> for chocolate. Europeans became aware of both chocolate and vanilla around 1520.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most popular}} <b>flavors</b> are [...] "Grill" [...] and [...] "Barbecue". Other <b>flavors</b> include onion, smoky, pizza, falafel, taco and hamburger. Each <b>flavor</b> is shaped differently: the pizza <b>flavored</b> snacks are shaped like squares, the onion <b>flavor</b> like small hoops, and the smoky <b>flavor</b> like small hollow tubes.|$|R
50|$|Since its {{acquisition}} of Chipsy, Lay's chips (marketed as Chipsy) in Egypt inherited the Chipsy range of <b>flavors</b> {{as well as}} the pre-merger Lay's <b>flavors.</b> These <b>flavors</b> include salt and vinegar, cheese (most likely based on Roumy cheese and the most popular <b>flavor),</b> seasoned cheese, tomato (a ketchup-based <b>flavor),</b> kebab on charcoal, and chili & lime, and Peri peri <b>flavor.</b> In 2010, a shrimp <b>flavor</b> was added after a national contest.|$|R
40|$|Five <b>flavor</b> {{compounds}} of terpenoid, i. e α-pinene, myrcene, limonene, linalool, and α-terpineol were encapsulated with starch hydrolyzates, namely starch stearate and starch propionate by {{spray drying}} at <b>flavor</b> compounds/modified starch ratio 20 : 80. The encapsulated <b>flavor</b> products were stored in plastic bag at 45 oC for 9 weeks. The encapsulated <b>flavor</b> products {{were analyzed by}} scanning electron microscopy and <b>flavor</b> retention using gas chromatography. Results in- dicated that the surfaces of particles of encapsulated <b>flavor</b> were rough, hollow in the middle, with a concave radius of curvature. The <b>flavor</b> compounds were entrapped within the encapsulant wall. The retention of <b>flavor</b> compounds during storage decreased. After collapsed, retention of <b>flavor</b> compounds was stable and finally decreased. The highest decrease in retention of encapsulated <b>flavor</b> compounds was myrcene, followed by limonene, α-pinene, linalool, and α-terpineol. Lima komponen <b>flavor</b> golongan terpenoid, yaitu α-pinene, myrcene, limonene, linalool, dan α-terpineol dienkapsulasi dengan hidrolisat pati stearat dan hidrolisat pati propionat dengan menggunakan pengering semprot pada nisbah komponen flavor/pati termodifikasi adalah 20 : 80. Produk <b>flavor</b> terenkapsulasi dikemas dalam kantong plastik dan disimpan pada suhu 45 oC selama 9 minggu. Produk <b>flavor</b> terenkapsulasi dianalisis dengan scanning electron micros- copy dan retensi <b>flavor</b> dengan gas kromatografi. Hasilnya menunjukkan bahwa permukaan partikel-partikel <b>flavor</b> terenkapsulasi adalah kasar, berlubang pada bagian tengahnya dengan lekukan cekung. Komponen-komponen <b>flavor</b> menempel pada dinding enkapsulan. Retensi komponen <b>flavor</b> selama penyimpanan menurun. Setelah collaps, retensi komponen <b>flavor</b> stabil dan akhirnya menurun. Retensi komponen <b>flavor</b> yang paling cepat penurunannya adalah myrcene, diikuti dengan limonene, α-pinene, linalool, dan α-terpineo...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{important}} goals for future neutrino telescopes is to identify the <b>flavors</b> of astrophysical neutrinos and therefore determine the <b>flavor</b> ratio. The <b>flavor</b> ratio of astrophysical neutrinos observed on the Earth depends on both the initial <b>flavor</b> ratio at the source and <b>flavor</b> transitions taking place during propagations of these neutrinos. We propose a model independent parametrization for describing the above <b>flavor</b> transitions. A few <b>flavor</b> transition models are employed to test our parametrization. The observational test for <b>flavor</b> transition mechanisms through our parametrization is discussed. Comment: Matches the published versio...|$|R

50|$|Second, smell liquor. Korean {{traditional}} {{spirits are}} divided into two <b>flavors.</b> One is the <b>flavor</b> unique to yeast. It is delicate and it has fruit <b>flavor.</b> Even if fruit juice is not used, well fermented traditional liquor gives fruit <b>flavor</b> such as apple or watermelon <b>flavor.</b> This scent is created by fermenting the wheat bran of yeast. Yakju, rice wine, ripened at low temperature has this <b>flavor.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Additional {{work may}} also {{be done by the}} <b>flavor</b> company. For example, the <b>flavor</b> company may conduct sensory taste tests to test {{consumer}} acceptance of a <b>flavor</b> before it is sent to the client or to further investigate the [...] "sensory space". The <b>flavor</b> company may also employ application specialists who work to ensure the <b>flavor</b> will work in the application for which it is intended. This may require special <b>flavor</b> delivery technologies that are used to protect the <b>flavor</b> during processing or cooking so that the <b>flavor</b> is only released when eaten by the end consumer.|$|R
25|$|Pandan waffles {{originate}} from Vietnam and {{are characterized by}} the use of pandan <b>flavoring</b> and coconut milk in the batter. The pandan <b>flavoring</b> results in the batter's distinctive spring green color. When cooked, the waffle browns and crisps on the outside and stays green and chewy on the inside. Unlike most waffles, pandan waffles are typically eaten plain. In Vietnam they are relatively cheap and so are popular among children. They are a popular street food made in either cast iron molds heated with charcoal or in electric waffle irons.|$|E
