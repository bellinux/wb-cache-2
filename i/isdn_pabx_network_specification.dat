40|$|Fast {{advances}} in communication engineering {{especially in the}} office environment, require an integration of different services and the easy accessibility of these services via smaller and more compact equipment. The integration of voice and data has been the goal of ISDN technology. There is also a high demand for the transfer of high speed data (1. 536 Mbps e. g. for computer graphics) across different floors and buildings in a typical office environment. One efficient solution for this is to attempt to integrate LAN within an <b>ISDN</b> <b>PABX</b> system.

40|$|This paper compares {{alternative}} methods for approximating and solving the stochastic growth model with parameterized expectations. We compare polynomial and neural netowork specifications for expectations, and we employ both genetic algorithm and gradient-descent methods for solving the alternative models of parameterized expectations. Many of the statistics {{generated by the}} neural <b>network</b> <b>specification</b> {{in combination with the}} genetic algorithm and gradient descent optimization methods approach the statistics generated by the exact solution with risk aversion coefficients close to unity and full depreciation of the capital stock. For the alternative specification, with no depreciation of capital, the neural network results approach those generated by computationally-intense methods. Our results suggest that the neural <b>network</b> <b>specification</b> and genetic algorithm solution methods should at least complement parameterized expectation solutions based on polynomial approximation and pure gradient-descent optimization. ...|$|R

40|$|A new {{methodology}} for {{the generation of}} efficient parallel programs from high-level neural <b>network</b> <b>specifications</b> is presented.

Introduction Many neural network learning algorithms require a large number of iterations to converge towards good results. Often also a lot of critical parameters that are not known in advance (e. g. learning rate, number of neurons, initializations) must be selected experimentally. So all together an enourmous computation time is used and fast implementations on universal parallel computers (especially SIMD architectures like MasPar [1]) or neurocomputers (like CNAPS [2]) are required. Unfortunately, the programming o [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{suggests}} {{a new approach}} to solving the one-sector stochastic growth model using the method of parameterized expectations. The approach is to employ a "global " genetic algorithm search for the parameters of the expectation function followed by a "local " gradient-descent optimization method to ensure fine-tuning of the approximated solution. We use this search procedure in combination with either polynomial or neural <b>network</b> <b>specifications</b> for the expectation function. We find that our approach yields highly accurate solutions in the case where an exact analytic solution exists as well as in cases where no closed-form solution exists. Our results further suggest that neural <b>network</b> <b>specifications</b> for the expectation function may be preferred to the more commonly used polynomial specification.

40|$|Abstract There is a {{need for}} tools that {{facilitate}} the systematic exploration of novel theoretical neural network models. Existing neural network simulation environments, neural <b>network</b> <b>specification</b> languages, and genetic encoding of neural networks fall short of providing the tools needed for this task. We suggest that a useful approach to the design of such tools may be the use of a grammar to capture neural design principles as well as structural and behavioral elements, and mechanisms to automatically translate the parse trees of the grammar into complete neural <b>network</b> <b>specifications</b> in a generic format. We present the Attribute Grammar Encoding (AGE) as a specific example of our approach that uses attribute grammars to create descriptions of neural network solutions in an XML-based format termed the Generic Neural Markup Language (GNML). Lessons learned from the development of this system are presented to identify and address the issues of a broader application of this approach to other specification formats and other grammar encoding approaches.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{an extended}} definition of service networks. The service network definition, {{which can be}} used for classifying service networks, comprises two parts: the service network declaration and the service <b>network</b> <b>specification.</b> The service <b>network</b> <b>specification</b> consists of the <b>specification</b> of the <b>network</b> characteristics, the node characteristics, and the link characteristics. Each of these three characteristics comprises a set of criteria. One fraction of the criteria has been identified through literature research on services, networked organizations, and service network concepts. The remaining fraction of criteria {{is the result of a}} case study analysis. The service network case study has been taken from the information technology sector (i. e., the network of Cloud computing services).

To solve this problem, we propose {{a theoretical framework}} derived from the Platform Based Design (PBD) methodology [19]. According to the PBD principles, we first map control <b>specifications</b> to communication <b>network</b> <b>specifications</b> involving a set of values of the communication parameters such as quantization noise, coding, modulation scheme, and power level. Then, a communication scheme is chosen according to the communications specifications so that the control specifications are satisfied. To do so, we use a hybrid system formalism that models the dynamical behavior of the communication scheme to capture the mixed continuousdiscrete characteristics of the configuration parameters.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we compare three {{different}} specifications of gravity models for inter regional freight flow prediction. The most used specification with OLS estimation is {{compared with a}} model where data {{are assumed to be}} Poisson distributed. We also compare these with a Feed Forward Back Propagation Neural Network. Data consists of freight flows between Norwegian counties. The attribute describing the nodes is population and distance in kilometers gives the friction on transport links. Since we here only are interested in inter regional flows all intra regional flows are excluded. Results are also compared with an earlier study by Bergkvist and Westin (1997) were all data were used. Estimations indicate that OLS compared to Poisson and Neural <b>Network</b> <b>specifications</b> will produce worse predictions. However, the question on how to compare performance is not undisputable and of great importance since different measures can produce quite different results, not just in scale but also in ranking. When non-linear models are used the lack of a simple interpretable R-square measure as in linear regression is evident. We therefore use different measures of performance and discuss their pros and cons. Bergkvist E. and Westin L.
