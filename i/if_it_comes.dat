5|$|Evolution {{also does}} not require that organisms become more complex. Although the history of life shows an {{apparent}} trend towards the evolution of biological complexity; {{there is a question}} if this appearance of increased complexity is real, or <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from neglecting the fact that the majority of life on Earth has always consisted of prokaryotes. In this view, complexity is not a necessary consequence of evolution, but that specific circumstances of evolution on Earth frequently made greater complexity advantageous and thus naturally selected for. Depending on the situation, organisms' complexity can either increase, decrease, or stay the same, and all three of these trends have been observed in evolution.|$|E

If the parents stay together during the incubation period, they will take turns standing guard over the eggs while the other drinks and feeds within earshot.

5|$|The chiral pitch, p, {{refers to}} the {{distance}} over which the LC molecules undergo a full 360° twist (but note that {{the structure of the}} chiral nematic phase repeats itself every half-pitch, since in this phase directors at 0° and ±180° are equivalent). The pitch, p, typically changes when the temperature is altered or when other molecules are added to the LC host (an achiral LC host material will form a chiral phase if doped with a chiral material), allowing the pitch of a given material to be tuned accordingly. In some liquid crystal systems, the pitch is of the same order as the wavelength of visible light. This causes these systems to exhibit unique optical properties, such as Bragg reflection and low-threshold laser emission, and these properties are exploited in a number of optical applications. For the case of Bragg reflection only the lowest-order reflection is allowed if the light is incident along the helical axis, whereas for oblique incidence higher-order reflections become permitted. Cholesteric liquid crystals also exhibit the unique property that they reflect circularly polarized light when it is incident along the helical axis and elliptically polarized <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> in obliquely.|$|E

25|$|Some {{classes of}} matroid have been defined from {{well-known}} families of graphs, by phrasing a characterization of these graphs {{in terms that}} make sense more generally for matroids. These include the bipartite matroids, in which every circuit is even, and the Eulerian matroids, which can be partitioned into disjoint circuits. A graphic matroid is bipartite if and only <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from a bipartite graph and a graphic matroid is Eulerian if and only <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from an Eulerian graph. Within the graphic matroids (and more generally within the binary matroids) these two classes are dual: a graphic matroid is bipartite {{if and only if}} its dual matroid is Eulerian, and a graphic matroid is Eulerian if and only if its dual matroid is bipartite.|$|E

500|$|Each {{level is}} split up into four [...] "Mares" [...] set in Nightopia and a boss fight {{which takes place}} in Nightmare. In each level, players {{initially}} control Claris or Elliot, who immediately have their Ideyas (spherical objects that contain emotions) of hope, wisdom, intelligence and purity stolen from them by Wizeman's minions, leaving behind only their Ideya of courage. The goal of each Mare is to recover one of the stolen Ideya by collecting 20 blue chips and delivering them to the cage holding the Ideyas, which will overload and release the orb it holds. If the player walks around the landscape for too long, they will be pursued by a sentient alarm clock which will awaken the character and end the level <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> {{into contact with the}} player.

Rolling Stone magazine was generally impressed with the effort, writing that the album [...] "sound as <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from the heart". It resulted in three singles making it to number-one on the Billboard Hot 100: [...] "Live to Tell", [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] and [...] "Open Your Heart", and two more top-five singles: [...] "True Blue" [...] and [...] "La Isla Bonita". The album topped the charts in over 28 countries worldwide, an unprecedented achievement at the time, and became her best-selling studio album of her career with sales of 25 million. In the same year, Madonna starred in the critically panned film Shanghai Surprise, for which she received her first Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress. She made her theatrical debut in a production of David Rabe's Goose and Tom-Tom; the film and play both co-starred Penn. The next year, Madonna was featured in the film Who's That Girl.

500|$|In 2005, good-girl Cassie {{becomes a}} rebellious teenager; Nick and Sharon have a {{difficult}} time dealing with her. Cassie has a crush on bad-boy Daniel Romalotti (Michael Graziadei), who is dating Lily Winters (Christel Khalil). One night, against her parents' wishes she sneaks out to a party. In a ploy to impress a drunken Daniel she attempts to drive him home, despite being underage. The car crashes, leaving them with no memory of the accident. Daniel is thought to have been driving, and is blamed for the accident. Cassie becomes hospitalized and escapes to find Daniel to tell him she was driving, but is soon re-admitted. During the May 24 episode, Cassie dies with Nick and Sharon at her side. Grimes said she did not think Cassie would die, but if it was [...] "meant to happen, it's meant to happen". The actress found filming her last scenes with Case and Morrow [...] "ridiculously hard". Case also found taping the scenes devastating: [...] "It was too real for Joshua and me to even go through it. We did it in one take. [...] The scene is still devastating in my mind and Joshua’s. [...] It’s almost not watchable. [...] <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> on, I can’t get through it". Daniel is cleared of all charges and Nick and Sharon begin Cassie's Foundation, a movement to prevent teenage drinking and driving. According to Case, when Sharon loses something in her life it [...] "reminds her and reactivates Cassie’s death for her". After Nick cheats on Sharon following Cassie's death, Case said it [...] "makes you so fearful {{that you are going to}} be alone for the rest of your life; that no matter what you go out in life to create, it’s going to be ruined anyway". The actress also believed that Sharon lost her identity after Cassie's death. In 2012, during a court battle over Newman Enterprises (the family company), Nick stated that Sharon's mental problems date to Cassie's death.|$|E
500|$|The {{community}} of Stockton opposed filming in the area, as memories of Leigh's murder were still fresh {{and the details}} of the script were [...] "too close for comfort". When filmmakers arrived in Stockton in late August 1996, locations that had previously been reserved were suddenly no longer available. The local media treated them with hostility. Former Newcastle deputy mayor and Stockton resident Frank Rigby criticised the film during production, saying [...] "I would just love it to go away and so would everybody else." [...] Brian Joyce was also critical of the decision to film in the area, saying the filmmakers had to acknowledge the choice they had made in doing so. The situation was exacerbated by the filmmakers' denial that the film was specifically about Leigh, despite their choice of Stockton for filming. During production [...] in September 1996, Elfick told The Newcastle Herald that he was [...] "getting a bit bored" [...] of people mentioning Leigh's murder. While acknowledging that the comments were understandable, Elfick concluded, [...] "Unfortunately, that event happens all over Australia. We wanted to take the events of that murder and many other murders". He was also quoted in The Sydney Morning Herald as saying, [...] "The movie is bigger than the Leigh Leigh thing". Elfick hoped that people viewing the film would see it as a positive {{way of looking at the}} circumstances that led to Leigh's death, and that it would make people think and maybe stop something like that happening to someone in the future. Leigh's family were vehemently opposed to the film, saying that the filmmakers were [...] "feasting on an unfortunate situation", insensitively trivialising and exploiting her death, and portraying her negatively while doing so. One of Leigh's aunts wrote to The Newcastle Herald later that month, saying [...] "David Elfick doesn't seem to mind [...] free publicity even <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from the tragic and brutal assault, rape, and murder of a fourteen-year-old virgin, not as he called it: 'the Leigh Leigh thing which happens all over Australia.'" [...] Enright said that while Leigh's murder served as the inspiration, the completed film is about the way a small town reacts when one of its own members murders another.|$|E
