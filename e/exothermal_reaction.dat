The existence of moisture can absorb the heat and prohibit the chemical reactions as well. Consequently, the oxidation reaction proceeds slowly {{and so does the}} endothermal process.

40|$|When {{mineral wool}} is heated to fire temperatures, heat is {{developed}} inside the material. Experiments {{have shown that}} although the mineral wool is externally heated, the temperatures inside the material rises well above the temperatures registered {{on the surface of}} the material. This phenomenon is a result of two <b>exothermal</b> <b>reactions</b> taking place in the material. The first one is combustion of binder and oil, the other one is recrystallization of the amorphous fibers in the material. SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden is developing methods to couple fire simulations to heat transfer calculations and structural mechanical calculations. A part of this work is to evaluate a new tool – Gpyro – that can be coupled to e. g. FDS and be used as a boundary condition in FDS simulations. This work aims to evaluate if Gpyro can be used to simulate the <b>exothermal</b> <b>reactions</b> that takes place in the mineral wool. Thermal transfer both in general and in mineral wool, as well as the <b>exothermal</b> <b>reactions</b> taking place in the mineral wool was studied. The Gpyro software has been studied and simulations have been performed, to analyze if Gpyro is an appropriate tool for simulations of the phenomenon. Analyses have been made of how changes in the parameters used in the program affect the simulated reactions. Conclusions have been made that problems describing the basic thermal transport from the experiment with Gpyro, does not lie in its equations or how they are solved, since relevant equations are used in Gpyro and simulations in Comsol verify the simulated data. Rather are the temperature differences between experiment and simulation considered to be a result of the simplifications made when simulating the experiment. So there is nothing wrong with the heat transfer calculations in Gpyro. The material can be simulated to a relatively good level. This is done by specifying temperature dependent material parameters such as conductivity, specific heat capacity and density. A possibility to specify these parameters with greater detail would have been appreciated, though. With the approach used in this work, the conductivity of the material is dependent of the density of the material. That way, the conductivity has to be specified separately for different densities of the material. But there is a possibility to solve a separate equation for porosity, which makes the conductivity density independent. This approach was not possible to use due to the conductivity data used as a base for this work, but should be considered for future studies. Gpyro has the capabilities to simulate the exothermal effects from one of the experiments to satisfaction, but with the timeframe of this work, there is no possibility to simulate the reactions in a general way. The reaction parameters derived in this work fit one of the experiments only, and further work will be needed to derive the general parameters for the equations. The property estimation part of Gpyro which was not to be used in this work, can probably be a usable tool in the work of deriving the correct parameters for the reactions.
