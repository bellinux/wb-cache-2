Benzoylecgonine is the metabolite which is normally used to identify the presence of cocaine in urine (5). The determination of ecgonine methyl ester in urine, however, can provide valuable and important forensic information about he source of BE {{and the time of}} cocaine ingestion (4 - 7). Laboratories should therefore be able to provide information on EME in addition to BE when requested. In a previous communication we presented a sensitive and selective qualitative procedure for EME analysis in urine (8). We now present arapid and sensitive procedure for the identification and quantitation of EME in urine. Ecgonine methyl ester hydrochloride was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.
