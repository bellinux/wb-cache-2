5|$|A {{coalition}} Government of National Union {{was installed}} {{in the capital of}} Vientiane, but it soon ran into difficulties. By the 2 October 1962 deadline for the removal of foreign troops, the North Vietnamese had pulled out only 40 personnel, leaving approximately 6,000 troops in the eastern <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> Meanwhile, rightist elements (in control of the army) opposed the new government. The U.S. played its part by increasing its assistance to the right by covertly supplying the army through Thailand. Despite another international accord, Laos remained ensnared by the political and territorial ambitions of communist neighbors, the security concerns of Thailand and the United States, and geographic fate.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, few {{professional}} football games took longer than {{two and a}} half hours to play, and the Jets–Raiders' three-hour time slot was thought to be adequate. A high-scoring contest, together with a number of injuries and penalties for the two bitter AFL rivals, caused the game to run long. NBC executives had originally ordered that Heidi begin at 7:00p.m. ET, but decided to allow the game to air to its conclusion. However, as 7p.m. approached, NBC's switchboards were jammed by viewers phoning to inquire about the night's schedule, preventing the planned change from being communicated. Heidi began as scheduled, preempting the final moments of the game and the two Oakland touchdowns in the eastern <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> to the outrage of viewers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, {{agriculture}} {{was the biggest}} industry in Ireland. In 1876, {{the government of the}} United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland commissioned a survey to find who owned the land in Ireland. The survey found that almost all land was the property of just 10,000 people, or 0.2% of the population. The majority were small landlords, but the 750 richest landlords owned <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> between them. Many of the richest were absentee landlords who lived in Britain or elsewhere in Ireland, and paid agents like Charles Boycott to manage their estates.|$|E
5|$|The May Revolution was {{a direct}} {{reaction}} to Spain's Peninsular War. In 1808, King FerdinandVII of Spain abdicated in favor of Napoleon, who granted the throne to his brother, Joseph Bonaparte. A Supreme Central Junta led resistance to Joseph's government and the French occupation of Spain, but eventually suffered a series of reversals {{that resulted in the}} Spanish loss of the northern <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> On February1, 1810, French troops took Seville and gained control of most of Andalusia. The Supreme Junta retreated to Cadiz and dissolved itself, and the Council of Regency of Spain and the Indies replaced it.

5|$|The first {{turnover}} of Squadron One cutters occurred on 16 May with {{the transfer of}} Point League and Point Garnet to the South Vietnamese Navy under the Vietnamization plan. An elaborate ceremony {{was held at the}} RVN Base in Saigon with dignitaries from many area naval activities witnessing the {{turnover of}} the two cutters. On 5 June, Division 11 was disestablished and its cutters were transferred to Division 13. The need for Squadron One cutters had been supplanted by the shallower draft PCFs and PBRs that were being concentrated in the Delta region for use in Operation Sealords. With better foul weather stationkeeping abilities than the U.S. Navy craft, the Point-class cutters of the Squadron were shifted for use during the northeast monsoon season in the northern <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b>|$|E
5|$|When the Geneva Conference in July 1954 {{ended the}} First Indochina War, it handed North Vietnam to Hồ Chí Minh's Việt Minh, {{and the south}} to the State of Vietnam. To reunify the country, {{national}} elections were scheduled for 1956, following which the French would withdraw from Indochina. The partition of Vietnam angered Ba Cụt and he vowed not to cut his hair until the nation was reunified. Having fought against the Việt Minh since 1947, Ba Cụt's principal criticism of Prime Minister Ngô Đình Diệm's State of Vietnam government stemmed from his belief that Diệm had been too passive in rejecting the partition, and that <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> {{should not have been}} yielded to the communists.|$|E
5|$|Between 31 May and 9 June 2008, {{representatives of}} Somalia's federal {{government}} and the moderate Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia (ARS) group of Islamist rebels participated in peace talks in Djibouti brokered by the UN. The conference ended with a signed agreement calling for the withdrawal of Ethiopian troops in exchange for the cessation of armed confrontation. Parliament was subsequently expanded to 550 seats to accommodate ARS members, which then elected a new president. With the help of a small team of African Union troops, the coalition government also began a counteroffensive in February 2009 to retake control of the southern <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> To solidify its control of southern Somalia, the TFG formed an alliance with the Islamic Courts Union, other members of the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia, and Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a, a moderate Sufi militia.|$|E

5|$|The Transitional Federal Government was internationally {{recognized}} as the government of Somalia until August 2012, when it {{was replaced by the}} Federal Government of Somalia. It was established in 2004 as a successor to the now defunct Transitional National Government, and currently occupies Somalia's seat in the United Nations. The TFG is allied with the Islamic Courts Union and the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia, and is backed by the United States, the United Nations and the African Union. Its forces are fighting to quell the ongoing insurgency in Somalia and are attempting to gain control of the southern <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> as the northern regions are both autonomous and comparatively stable. As a truce, in March 2009, Somalia's newly established coalition government announced that it would implement shari'a as the nation's official judicial system.|$|E
5|$|The fall of Constantinople on 29 May 1453 {{had great}} repercussions in the Morea. The two despots, the {{brothers}} Demetrios and Thomas, heartily detested {{each other and}} were unpopular among their own subjects. A rebellion broke out against them in autumn, supported both by the local Albanian immigrants and the native Greeks, and spread quickly. As the Sultan's vassals, the despots called upon Turkish aid, and Turahan's son Ömer arrived in December. After a few successes, he departed after securing the release of his brother from captivity. The revolt did not subside, and in October 1454 Turahan himself was forced to intervene. After sacking a few fortresses, the rebellious populace capitulated. Turahan advised the two Palaiologoi to compose their differences and rule well, and then departed the peninsula. The two brothers were however unable to reconcile themselves, and soon reverted to quarrelling and conspiring with Western powers against the Sultan. In retaliation, Mehmed II campaigned in the Morea in 1458 and seized the northwestern <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> which became an Ottoman province under Ömer. The rest of the despotate followed in 1460.|$|E
5|$|The marsh {{rice rat}} is {{classified}} as one of eight species in the genus Oryzomys, which is distributed from the eastern United States (marsh rice rat) into northwestern South America (O.gorgasi). Oryzomys previously included many other species, which were reclassified in various studies culminating in contributions by Marcelo Weksler and coworkers in 2006 that removed more than 40 species from the genus. All are placed in the tribe Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), a diverse assemblage of over 100 species, and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of the family Cricetidae, along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents, most of which occur in South and Central America. In the United States, the marsh rice rat is the only oryzomyine rodent except for Oryzomys couesi in a small area of southern Texas; the only other sigmodontines present are several species of cotton rats (Sigmodon) in the southern <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether temporary {{fluctuations in}} output around potential {{in developing countries}} are induced primarily by aggregate demand shocks or temporary aggregate supply shocks. Structural vector autoregression methodology using long-run restrictions is used to identify temporary output shocks for a large sample of developing countries. Impulse response functions are used to examine whether the temporary shocks behave like demand or supply shocks. The permanent/transitory decomposition appears to split the shocks into permanent supply shocks, and temporary demand or supply shocks depending on which influence dominates in a particular country. In a little over <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>countries,</b> temporary shocks behave like temporary aggregate supply shocks; in a little under <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>the</b> temporary shocks behave like aggregate demand shocks. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{referendum}} was {{the last}} phase in the power struggle between Bảo Đại and his prime minister. Bảo Đại disliked Diệm and had frequently attempted to undermine him, having appointed him only {{because he was a}} conduit to American aid. At the time, the country was going through a period of insecurity, as Vietnam had been temporarily partitioned {{as a result of the}} 1954 Geneva Accords that ended the First Indochina War. The State of Vietnam controlled the southern <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> pending national elections that were intended to reunify the country under a common government. Still, the Vietnamese National Army was not in full control of southern Vietnam; the Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo religious sects ran their own administrations in the countryside supported by private armies, while the Bình Xuyên organised crime syndicate controlled the streets of Saigon. Despite interference from these groups, Bảo Đại, and even French officials, Diệm managed to subdue the private armies and consolidate government control over the country by mid-1955.|$|E
5|$|Although McGregor envisaged the League as a {{friendly}} union, within which clubs would share ticket revenues {{and work together}} in their mutual best interests, the immediate effect of its creation was that football came {{to be treated as}} a business for the first time, as opposed to something that players and officials simply regarded as a pastime. All the clubs involved experienced significant increases in their turnover, which at Aston Villa, McGregor's own club, increased more than sixfold between 1889 and 1899. The wages paid to players, however, remained low due to restrictions imposed by the FA, so clubs were able to use their increased profitability to build larger stadiums and accommodate ever larger crowds of spectators. Although the League initially contained a small number of clubs, all of which were based in the northern <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> by {{the early years of the}} twentieth century it included clubs from all parts of England. At its peak nearly 100 clubs played in the Football League, and it remained the pre-eminent competition in English football until the 1990s, when the top clubs broke away to form the Premier League. In keeping with McGregor's views on mutual support and co-operation, gate receipts were shared amongst the clubs until the 1980s, which helped to ensure that a select few wealthy clubs were not able to dominate the competition. McGregor himself had little interest in the business aspect of football, and was adamant that the Football League should not challenge the longstanding authority of the FA. The success of the Football League directly inspired the creation of similar competitions in other countries, beginning with Scotland, where the Scottish Football League was formed in 1890.|$|E
5|$|The 1923 {{constitution}} was drawn up in non-racial terms, and the electoral system it devised was similarly open, {{at least in}} theory. Voting qualifications regarding personal income, education and property, {{similar to those of}} the Cape Qualified Franchise, were applied equally to all, but since most blacks did not meet the set standards, both the electoral roll and the colonial parliament were overwhelmingly from the white minority of about 5%. The result was that black interests were sparsely represented if at all, something that most of the colony's whites showed little interest in changing; they claimed that most blacks were uninterested in Western-style political process and that they would not govern properly if they took over. Bills such as the Land Apportionment Act of 1930, which earmarked about <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> for white ownership and residence while dividing the rest into black purchase, tribal trust and national areas, were variously biased towards the white minority. White settlers and their offspring provided most of the colony's administrative, industrial, scientific and farming skills, and built a relatively balanced, partially industrialised market economy, boasting strong agricultural and manufacturing sectors, iron and steel industries and modern mining enterprises. Everyday life was marked by discrimination ranging from job reservation for whites to petty segregation of trains, post office queues and the like. Whites owned most of the best farmland, and had far superior education, wages and homes, but the schooling, healthcare, infrastructure and salaries available to black Rhodesians were nevertheless very good by African standards.|$|E
