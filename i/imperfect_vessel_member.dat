40|$|The {{relationship}} between DNA synthesis and wound xylem differentiation {{was investigated in}} cultured stem segments of Coleus blumei. The addition of 50 micrograms of indoleacetic acid per liter to the culture medium resulted in a 400 to 500 % {{increase in the number}} of wound <b>vessel</b> <b>members</b> formed in 7 days. However, the time course of wound <b>vessel</b> <b>member</b> formation was similar in segments cultured in the presence and absence of auxin. In either case, no wound <b>vessel</b> <b>members</b> appeared before the 3 rd day of culture, while the majority of wound <b>vessel</b> <b>members</b> appeared on the 4 th and 5 th days of culture. 3 H-Thymidine incorporation into DNA was used to measure changes in the DNA synthetic activity of the tissues during the culture period. Comparatively little 3 H-thymidine incorporation occurred during the 1 st day of culture. Maximum 3 H-thymidine incorporation was observed on the 2 nd day of culture, 2 days before the peak period of xylem differentiation. The rate of incorporation of 3 H-thymidine into DNA decreased with increasing time in culture after the 2 nd day. Auxin at 50 micrograms per liter had no effect on the time course of 3 H-thymidine incorporation, although somewhat more 3 H-thymidine was incorporated into DNA throughout the culture period in the presence of auxin. The magnitude of this effect was small when compared to the effect of auxin on xylem differentiation. The antimetabolite 5 -fluorodeoxyuridine was shown to block DNA synthesis in the cultured stem segments. When the tissues were isolated on media containing 10 − 6 m 5 -fluorodeoxyuridine, wound <b>vessel</b> <b>member</b> differentiation was inhibited by approximately 80 %, in both the presence and absence of auxin. Thymidine at 10 − 5 m completely overcame the 5 -fluorodeoxyuridine inhibition of wound <b>vessel</b> <b>member</b> formation. 5 -Fluorodeoxyuridine was effective in blocking xylogenesis only when this substance was supplied to the tissues during the early part of the culture period. 5 -Fluorodeoxyuridine had no effect on xylem differentiation when it was applied after the 3 rd day of culture...|$|R

5000|$|Xylem {{serves as}} a chief {{conducting}} tissue of vascular plants. It {{is responsible for the}} conduction of water and mineral ions/salt. Xylem tissue is organized in a tube-like fashion along the main axes of stems and roots. It consists of a combination of parenchyma cells, fibers, vessels, tracheids, and ray cells. Longer tubes made up of individual cells are vessels (tracheae), while <b>vessel</b> <b>members</b> are open at each end. Internally, there may be bars of wall material extending across the open space. These cells are joined end to end to form long tubes. <b>Vessel</b> <b>members</b> and tracheids are dead at maturity.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} of functionally adaptive diversification of wood {{structure in the}} course of evolution as advanced by Carlquist is critically tested for <b>vessel</b> <b>member</b> length and type of perforation plate. The functional significance of within-tree variation in <b>vessel</b> <b>member</b> morphology is discussed first, and a criticism of Philipson & Butterfield’s theory for explaining classical length-on-age curves for fusiform initial length is given. At the genus and family level examples are cited which contradict the hypothesis that specialization of the perforation plate has a strong selective advantage for the occupation of more xeric environments or for high conductive rates. Other examples, however, seem to support this. The functional interpretation of correlations between <b>vessel</b> <b>member</b> length and ecological conditions is criticised. A comparison is made between whole woody floras or vegetation types with respect to the proportion of genera with scalariform perforation plates (Tables 1 and 2, Fig. 2). In tropical lowland rain forests the percentage of genera with scalariform plates is rather low. It strongly increases for tropical montane forests and for temperate to arctic floras. It is lowest in seasonally dry to arid regions. These trends support Carlquist’s idea that scalariform plates are, in general, only successful for conditions which require low rates of water conduction. In addition, the role of temperature is stressed. The total evidence presented in this paper is discussed in terms of random ‘patio ludens’ evolution which has to a considerable extent been canalized through selective pressures by environmental factors...|$|R

Additional data from the literature are added. The structural variation of the vestured pits is described and classified. There are two main types, of which the distribution follows the subfamily classification. Considering the overall wood anatomy, the recognition of two subfamilies: Strephonematoideae (Strephonema only) and Combretoideae (all remaining genera) can be supported. Strephonema stands out on account of its fibre-tracheids, type of vesturing and parenchyma distribution pattern. Within Combretoideae, one group of genera (subtribe Combretinae sensu Exell & Stace) stands out markedly on account of their radial vessels, a unique feature not known to occur in any other plant group, and two distinct size classes of vessel elements. The remaining genera, belonging to the tribe Laguncularieae and subtribes Terminaliinae and Pteleopsidinae of tribe Combreteae show a wide overlap in wood anatomical features. The Laguncularieae differ in the ratio of <b>vessel</b> <b>member</b> to fibre length, Terminaliinae and Pteleopsidinae cannot be separated wood anatomically. Although difficult to interpret phylogenetically, arguments are brought forward to consider Strephonema as having the most primitive wood structure and the Combretinae to have the most derived wood. Variation in some quantitative characters such as <b>vessel</b> <b>member</b> length is shown to be at least partly correlated with ecological conditions of the taxa involved.

40|$|The wood {{anatomy of}} 81 species of Ilex is {{described}} in detail. The wood anatomical range encountered is presented in a generic description (p. 196). Data on ontogenetic changes in <b>vessel</b> <b>member</b> length and number of bars per perforation are given for three species. The great amount of variation in mainly quantitative but also in some qualitative features is hardly or not related with subgeneric classification but with latitudinal and altitudinal distribution. In both {{the northern and southern}} hemisphere and in both the Old and New World, temperate and subtropical species are characterized by conspicuous growth rings, numerous narrow vessels, relatively short <b>vessel</b> <b>members</b> and few bars per perforation plate, conspicuous spiral thickenings on both vessel and fibre walls, and the fibretracheids are frequently provided with rather numerous conspicuously bordered tangential wall pits. In tropical lowland species growth rings are absent or less marked, the vessels are scanty and wide, the <b>vessel</b> <b>members</b> are long and the number of bars per perforation plate is high. Spirals are lacking or faint, or occur only in a minor part of the axial elements. The fibre-tracheids have usually few pits with more reduced borders on the tangential walls. Tropical montane species resemble the temperate ones to a great extent, but this does not apply to growth rings, spiral thickenings, and frequency and size of fibre-tracheid pits. The only wood sample of a climbing Ilex species from the tropics studied deviates from the general trend in having few bars per perforation plate. The two temperate species I. serrata and I. verticillata are exceptional in lacking spiral thickenings. In all wood characters they resemble the genus Nemopanthus (also Aquifoliaceae) very closely. Comparisons with data from literature and original observations on Prunus, Symplocos, Vaccinium. Viburnum, and to some extent also on Hydrangea, support the view that the gradual differences between temperate and tropical Ilex species conform to a general trend also present in other taxa. Therefore a major climatic influence on wood structure is indicated. This is discussed with reference to the major trends of phylogenetic wood specialization. The fact that within Ilex and Symplocos the tropical lowland species have perforations with the most numerous bars cannot be brought in agreement with the general phenomenon of a rare occurrence of scalariform perforations in tropical lowland floras. Other items such as the parallel between the absence of spiral thickenings and the presence of entire leaf margins, the lack of a clear taxonomic pattern in the wood anatomical variation in Ilex, and observations by former students of Ilex wood anatomy are also discussed...|$|R

The epidermis is single layered consisting of small and large cells. The epidermis bears multicellular hair and glandular trichomes. Beneath the epidermis there are 5 - 6 layers of cortical cells in the stem. The primary vascular tissue appears after the elongation of the first internode of the stem of lignosus bean. The internode between cotyledonary node and first leaf is considered as the first internode of the stem. The vascular bundles are collateral and arranged in a ring. The secretory cells devoid of tanniniferous contents have been observed in the phloem region of the younger stem but not in older ones. The cambium initiates in the primary vascular bundle between xylem and phloem at the basal part of the stem of 7 days old plant. The cambium is at first confined to the fascicular region. Subsequently it extends into the interfascicular region forming a complete cambial ring. After the formation of fascicular cambium it gives rise to secondary xylem adaxially and secondary phloem abaxially. Some <b>vessel</b> <b>members</b> are paired while the others are solitary.

40|$|The wood {{anatomy of}} the palaeotropical Melastomataceae is {{described}} in detail {{on the basis of}} 134 samples of 107 species from 36 genera. On the wood anatomy, three subfamilies are recognized, Memecyloideae, Melastomatoideae, and Crypteronioideae. The Memecyloideae stand out through their fibre-tracheids, the deviating fibre length/vessel member length ratio, and the scanty paratracheal to aliform parenchyma. The Melastomatoideae are characterised by libriform fibres showing fibre dimorphism and rays composed of erect, square, and weakly procumbent cells (also in Memecyloideae p. p.). The subfamily Astronioideae is abolished; Pternandra is transferred to Memecyloideae, the Astronieae fit perfectly in the Melastomatoideae. Within Melastomatoideae the tribes are not easy to separate. The subtribe Dissochaetineae (all climbers) of the Dissochaeteae stands out because of its multiseriate rays, subtribe Medinillineae has scalariform inter-vessel pits; Astronieae have longest <b>vessel</b> <b>members</b> of the palaeotropical Melastomataceae, uniseriate rays, and bands of deviating fibres in which axial parenchyma is scarcely present: in the Osbeckieae apotracheal parenchyma bands (probably originated through fibre dimorphism) characterise the wood of Dichaetanthera; it is proposed to combine Oxysporeae and Sonerileae to one tribe Sonerileae; {{on the basis of the}} inter-vessel pitting two subtribes are recognized, different in delimitation from the two original tribes.

The scalariform inter-vessel pits, present in palaeotropical Melastomataceae only, must be interpreted as a specialization from the alternate pattern. Raphides are present in one species of Bredia, B. tuberculata. Clustered crystals are observed in the axial parenchyma and rays of Dichaetanthera. Large elongate crystals are present in the parenchyma of the strands of axially included phloem of the Memecyloideae.

Xylem cells are specialised for conduction of water, and first appeared in plants during their transition to land in the Silurian period more than 425 million years ago (see Cooksonia).

Xylem tracheids are pointed, elongated xylem cells, the simplest of which have continuous primary cell walls and lignified secondary wall thickenings {{in the form of}} rings, hoops, or reticulate networks.

50|$|Phloem is {{an equally}} {{important}} plant tissue as {{it also is}} part of the 'plumbing system' of a plant. Primarily, phloem carries dissolved food substances throughout the plant. This conduction system is composed of sieve-tube member and companion cells, that are without secondary walls. The parent cells of the vascular cambium produce both xylem and phloem. This usually also includes fibers, parenchyma and ray cells. Sieve tubes are formed from sieve-tube members laid end to end. The end walls, unlike <b>vessel</b> <b>members</b> in xylem, do not have openings. The end walls, however, are full of small pores where cytoplasm extends from cell to cell.

It is the companion cells that are nestled between sieve-tube members that function in some manner bringing about the conduction of food. Sieve-tube members that are alive contain a polymer called callose, a carbohydrate polymer, forming the callus pad/callus, the colourless substance that covers the sieve plate. Callose stays in solution as long as the cell contents are under pressure. Phloem transports food and materials in plants upwards and downwards as required.|$|R
