500|$|How the García Girls Lost Their Accents is {{rife with}} the {{constant}} presence of fear which manifests itself in a seemingly endless variety of outlets.

This initial fear of Carlos' punishment {{for his role in the}} attempted assassination of Trujillo is what originally prompted the García family’s flight from the island and spawned the myriad other fears that would later plague their lives. The conflicted life the daughters would come to lead in the sexually liberated United States would be haunted by the fear of pregnancy and eternal damnation should they allow themselves to be seduced.|$|E

[...] When Barrett asked Brown if he would lead the attack, Brown responded that he would rather not.

[...] Several slight variations of Davis's response have been recorded. [...] His response is most often given as, [...] "I have not a man that <b>is</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> go." [...] Following Barrett's orders, Davis then moved his company to the right of the line. [...] Around 10:30, the provincials faced to the right and advanced on the Old North Bridge in a column of two men abreast. [...] At the head of the column was Davis, Major John Buttrick of Concord, and Lt. Col. John Robinson of Westford.

500|$|Following {{the events}} of [...] "The Bells of Saint John", in which he {{encountered}} a third version of Clara, the Doctor decides {{to learn more about}} his new companion and travels into her past to observe her. He finds that her parents met by a chance encounter caused by a gust of wind blowing a leaf into her father's face and discovers that her mother died while Clara was a teenager. The Doctor goes back to the present and collects Clara, then takes her to the Rings of Akhaten, where they observe a series of planetoids orbiting a planet, with a shining pyramid on one of them. The Doctor takes Clara to a giant alien marketplace and introduces her to several aliens, including a merchant named Dor'een who attempts to rent them a space bike. The market does not use hard currency but rather trades in items of sentimental value; this appalls Clara, who believes sentimental items should be cherished and not given away. She becomes separated from the Doctor and encounters a little girl (Emilia Jones) who appears to be running and hiding. Clara catches up to her and she explains that her name is Merry Galel, the Queen of Years. Merry tells Clara that she is hiding because she is supposed to sing a song at a ceremony and she <b>is</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> get it wrong. Clara reassures her by telling her what her mother once said, and Merry heads to the ceremony.|$|E

They cannot send up, I believe, more than five hundred men; but with two hundred such as now stand around me, I do not fear a thousand [...] nor fifteen hundred of them. The pikemen standing firm, we will give them such a volley of musketry as they will be little prepared for; and when they are thrown into confusion, we will sally out, chase them into the water, and ten to one but we secure their vessels. let every man be on the alert, and should these barbarians this night attempt our hill, I trust we shall convince them they are dealing with Britons.|$|E

Rachel tells Finn that she still cares about Jesse and that he needs to move on, prompting Finn to sing [...] "Jessie's Girl" [...] as his solo assignment. To put her fear into perspective, Finn introduces her to his friend Sean (Zack Weinstein), who was paralyzed from the upper chest down during a football game.

500|$|Other teams, however, {{had more}} serious {{interest}} in signing a black ballplayer. In the mid-1940s, Branch Rickey, club {{president and general}} manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, began to scout the Negro leagues for a possible addition to the Dodgers' roster. Rickey selected Robinson from a list of promising black players and interviewed him for possible assignment to Brooklyn's International League farm club, the Montreal Royals. Rickey was especially interested in making sure his eventual signee could withstand the inevitable racial abuse that would be directed at him. In a famous three-hour exchange on August 28, 1945, Rickey asked Robinson if he could face the racial animus without taking the bait and reacting angrily—a concern given Robinson's prior arguments with law enforcement officials at PJC and in the military. Robinson was aghast: [...] "Are you looking for a Negro who <b>is</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> fight back?" [...] Rickey replied that he needed a Negro player [...] "with guts enough not to fight back." [...] After obtaining a commitment from Robinson to [...] "turn the other cheek" [...] to racial antagonism, Rickey agreed to sign him to a contract for $600 a month, equal to $ today. Rickey did not offer compensation to the Monarchs, instead believing all Negro league players were free agents due to the contracts' not containing a reserve clause. Among those Rickey discussed prospects with was Wendell Smith, writer for the black weekly Pittsburgh Courier, who according to Cleveland Indians owner and team president Bill Veeck [...] "influenced Rickey to take Jack Robinson, for which he's never completely gotten credit." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} summary {{synopsis of}} the film was published in The Moving Picture World. It states, [...] "A poor widow who supports her two children, one a baby and the other girl of six, by scrubbing, weakens under her hard work, and finally dies. Marie, the 'little mother,' anxious that her home may not be broken up, calls {{on one of her}} mother's employers and requests that she be given a chance to take the dead woman's place. The artist, a wealthy, good-hearted man, pleased with the child's pluck, laughingly employs her, and makes her believe that she is really doing all the 'chores.' The artist's kindness, much to his surprise, brings him recompense one [...] One of his models plots to fleece him. She calls at his studio, faints in his arms, and when her confederate rushes in with a policeman, she makes charges that lead to the arrest of the innocent artist. Just as the policeman is leading her benefactor away, the little scrub woman sees what is happening. She follows the party to the police station, but <b>is</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> enter. When the complainant and her husband come out, the child is impressed with the fact that they seem to be on the best of terms. Her suspicions are aroused, and she shadows them like a regular detective. What crook would ever imagine that a little girl, wheeling a baby carriage, was a sleuth? This pair certainly did not, for when they meet a new friend in the park, they stop to tell him how they successfully arranged to trim a rich artist, never doubting that he would pay liberally to have the case dropped. The little girl, from her place in hiding, heard the story. So the little girl found a policeman, and told him about it. And the policeman went with her to the hiding place, and heard enough to warrant him in making what he afterward described as a 'two handed collar.' The adventurous and her confederate were hailed to the police station and locked up, while the artist was set free in a hurry. The result is that there is now a 'scrub woman' whose duties are a sinecure although the wages are high, {{and the future of the}} 'little mother' and her baby are assured." ...|$|E
