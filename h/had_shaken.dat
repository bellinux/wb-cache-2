25|$|After {{his release}} from prison in June 1994, Fay {{returned}} to the United States {{to live with his}} biological father. He gave several television interviews, including one with his American lawyer on CNN with Larry King on June 29, 1994, in which he admitted taking road signs but denied vandalizing cars. He also claimed that he was ill-treated during questioning, but <b>had</b> <b>shaken</b> hands with the caning operative after his four strokes had been administered.|$|E
25|$|Cumann na nGaedheal, {{the party}} which backed the {{incumbent}} government, {{decided not to}} formally support any candidates {{as a result of}} internal divisions. There was tension between ministers, backbenchers, and grassroots members, and between factions of Kevin O'Higgins and W. T. Cosgrave. The 1924 Army Mutiny <b>had</b> <b>shaken</b> the year-old party, and the appointment of public servants to lead the new state's institutions created resentment among those passed over. The parliamentary party held two selection conventions, on 2 and 6 July 1925, and when the leadership's candidates did badly a free vote was offered in the Dáil with all candidates nominally endorsed by the party.|$|E
25|$|Once he <b>had</b> <b>shaken</b> off his pursuers, Bey turned {{northeast}} in {{an attempt}} to circle round them. Burnett, instead of giving chase in sea conditions that were limiting his cruisers' speed to , positioned Force 1 so as to protect the convoy. It was a decision that he had some personal doubts about and which was criticised in some quarters but supported by Fraser, but to Burnett's relief, shortly after noon Scharnhorst approached the cruisers once more. As fire was again exchanged, Scharnhorst scored hits on Norfolk, disabling a turret and her radar. Following this exchange, Bey decided to return to port, while he ordered the destroyers to attack the convoy at a position reported by a U-boat. The reported position was out of date and the destroyers missed the convoy.|$|E

25|$|Several {{economists and}} historians have {{analyzed}} {{some of the}} events and policy mistakes that precipitated the crisis of December 1994. In keeping with the PRI election-year practices, Salinas launched a spending spree to finance popular projects, which translated into a historically high deficit. This budget deficit was coupled with a current account deficit, fueled by excessive consumer spending as allowed by the overvalued peso. In order to finance this deficit, the Salinas administration issued tesobonos, an attractive debt instrument that insured payment in dollars instead of pesos. This {{may have been a}} response to three important events that <b>had</b> <b>shaken</b> investor confidence in the stability of the country: the Zapatista uprising, the assassination of PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, and the assassination of José Francisco Ruiz Massieu, Salinas' former brother-in-law, who was also the Secretary General of the PRI and whose murder was never solved during Salinas' presidency, even when Mario Ruiz Massieu (Francisco's brother) was the attorney general and in charge of the investigation.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{rebellion}} <b>had</b> <b>shaken</b> the British enterprise in India, {{it had not}} derailed it. After the war, the British became more circumspect. Much thought was devoted to the causes of {{the rebellion}}, and from it three main lessons were drawn. At a more practical level, it was felt that there needed to be more communication and camaraderie between the British and Indians—not just between British army officers and their Indian staff but in civilian life as well. The Indian army was completely reorganised: units composed of the Muslims and Brahmins of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, who had formed the core of the rebellion, were disbanded. New regiments, like the Sikhs and Baluchis, composed of Indians who, in British estimation, had demonstrated steadfastness, were formed. From then on, the Indian army was to remain unchanged in its organisation until 1947. The 1861 Census had revealed that the English population in India was 125,945. Of these only about 41,862 were civilians as compared with about 84,083 European officers and men of the Army. In 1880, the standing Indian Army consisted of 66,000 British soldiers, 130,000 Natives, and 350,000 soldiers in the princely armies.|$|E
25|$|A low-scoring {{first day}} of cricket at Lord's {{included}} two batting collapses, first from Australia and then from England who got their go at batting just before tea. Ricky Ponting won the toss and chose to bat, and after Steve Harmison <b>had</b> <b>shaken</b> up the opening batsmen early on, hitting Australia's batsmen with bouncers, in particular one that had Justin Langer on the elbow, a procession of wickets began. Matthew Hoggard was inaccurate, but the early swing under the cloud suited him, and the ball that he did get on line swung between bat and pad to smash into Matthew Hayden's off stump. Australia still scored quickly, helped by aggressive field placings from England, but Harmison got the reward for short and pacy bowling when Ricky Ponting edged him to Andrew Strauss at third slip for 9. Langer, who had looked immaculate all morning and taken on the bowlers, was next to depart, Michael Vaughan getting reward with his bowling changes as Andrew Flintoff lured Langer into an expansive pull to Harmison at square leg. And when Simon Jones was brought on in the 16th over, he got an immediate reward, with Damien Martyn gone for 2. Another man came and went before lunch, Michael Clarke, and Australia were five down after the first session of play.|$|E

An unofficial Aruban-affiliated spokesperson and commentator on the case said that the uncut videotape showed that Kalpoe <b>had</b> <b>shaken</b> {{his head and said}} [...] "No, she didn't.", thereby denying that Holloway had sex with him and the other two men. According to an MSNBC report, the crucial words are inaudible, and presenter Rita Cosby questioned if it could be substantiated that Kalpoe had ever made the statements attributed to him in the Dr. Phil version of the recording.|$|E
500|$|The {{effects of}} the Third Servile War on Roman attitudes towards slavery, and on the {{institution}} of slavery in Rome, are harder to determine. Certainly the revolt <b>had</b> <b>shaken</b> the Roman people, who [...] "out of sheer fear seem to have begun to treat their slaves less harshly than before." [...] The wealthy owners of the latifundia began {{to reduce the number}} of agricultural slaves, opting to employ the large pool of formerly dispossessed freemen in sharecropping arrangements. With the end of Augustus' reign (27 BC - 14 AD), the major Roman wars of conquest ceased until the reign of Emperor Trajan (reigned 98–117 AD), and with them ended the supply of plentiful and inexpensive slaves through military conquest. This era of peace further promoted the use of freedmen as laborers in agricultural estates.|$|E

Evans felt that his posturing <b>had</b> <b>shaken</b> Goodhew. Tonelli, the eldest swimmer in the quartet at the age of 23, convened the team as its de facto leader. He asked his teammates to commit to swimming their legs in a certain time; Kerry vowed to swim the backstroke in 57s, Evans the breaststroke in 63s flat, Tonelli the butterfly in 54s and Brooks promised to anchor the team in 49.8s, even though he had never gone faster than 51s. Tonelli named the foursome as the Quietly Confident Quartet, and they exhibited a quiet confidence as they lined up for the race.|$|E

500|$|Murphy has {{clashed with}} Stephen Maguire, {{another of the}} 2000 Young Players of Distinction, on several occasions. At the start of their 2004 Grand Prix match, there was an {{incident}} that resulted in Maguire being docked the opening frame. After they <b>had</b> <b>shaken</b> hands {{at the outset of}} the first frame, Maguire asked referee Johan Oomen for permission to leave the arena and retrieve his chalk, which he had forgotten. While Maguire was away, the referee and Murphy spoke before tournament director Mike Ganley arrived on the scene and docked Maguire a frame for technically not being ready to start at the scheduled time, which angered and surprised Maguire. Murphy refutes that the docking of the frame was down to him speaking to the referee. Maguire won the match 5–2 and later commented: [...] "Rules are rules but I've never heard of anything like that happening before".|$|E
500|$|The Royal Navy search became frantic, {{as many of}} the British {{ships were}} low on fuel. Victorious and her escorting cruisers were sent west, Wake-Walker's ships {{continued}} to the south and west, and Tovey continued to steam toward the mid-Atlantic. Force H, with the aircraft carrier [...] and steaming up from Gibraltar, was still at least a day away. Unaware that he <b>had</b> <b>shaken</b> off Wake-Walker, Lütjens sent long radio messages to Naval Group West headquarters in Paris. The signals were intercepted by the British, from which bearings were determined. They were wrongly plotted on board King George V, leading Tovey to believe that Bismarck was heading back to Germany through the Iceland-Faeroe gap, which kept his fleet on the wrong course for seven hours. By the time the mistake had been discovered, Bismarck had put a sizeable gap between herself and the British ships.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the Test series, {{the party}} played matches against State sides and {{selected}} Australian elevens. The intended fast leg theory attack was not revealed until the fifth of these games, against [...] "An Australian XI" [...] (including Bradman), which began at Melbourne on 18 November. Larwood dismissed Bradman for low scores {{in each of}} the Australian innings, writing later: [...] "It was a refreshing sight to see [...] clumsily waving his bat in the air". Hobbs, who having retired from Test cricket was reporting the tour for London's The Star newspaper, thought that the bowling <b>had</b> <b>shaken</b> Bradman's confidence: [...] "He was drawing away, sure proof that he didn't like the bumpers". [...] The English tactics in the game offended the crowds and so upset H.V. Evatt (later leader of the Australian Labor Party, then a High Court judge) that he lost all desire to watch any of that year's Tests.|$|E

500|$|By 1989, the Peace Candle {{had become}} so {{dilapidated}} that it was hardly able to sustain the winter weather. Strong winds in November <b>had</b> <b>shaken</b> the structure {{so much that the}} wax dripping fixtures atop the candle had fallen off. On November 16, 1989, Mayor Sal Panto Jr. announced on WEST's Voice of the People show that the Peace Candle would not go up another year because the support structure was too weak and the Easton Area Christmas Committee was not receiving enough donations to pay for repairs. The committee was now receiving an average of $3,000 a year in donations, which was used to maintain the existing candle. Panto said, [...] "The sad reality is, this is the last year." [...] However, new fundraising efforts were started to raise $20,000 to build a new Peace Candle. Local businesses and unions volunteered their time and materials to work on it, with the Lehigh Valley Carpenters Union working up to 100 hours a week for about five weeks to have the candle ready for the 1990 holiday season.|$|E
500|$|Despite his {{activity}} being much reduced, {{he still}} kept himself {{informed about the}} polemics agitating Romania's cultural and political scene. He was also occasionally hosting Eminescu, witnessing his friend's struggle with mental disorder. The two failed to reconnect, and their relationship ended. After one of the meetings, he recorded that the delusional poet was carrying around a revolver with which to fend off unknown attackers—among {{the first in a}} series of episodes which ended with Eminescu's psychiatric confinement and death during June 1889. Around that time, Creangă, like other Junimists, was involved in a clash of ideas with the emerging Romanian socialist and atheistic group, rallied around Contemporanul magazine. This occurred after Contemporanul founder Ioan Nădejde publicly ridiculed Învățătoriul copiilor over its take on creationism, quoting its claim that [...] "the invisible hand of God" [...] was what made seeds grow into plants. Creangă replied with a measure of irony, stating that [...] "had God not pierced the skin over our eyes, we would be unable to see each other's mistakes". Nevertheless, Călinescu argued, Nădejde's comments <b>had</b> <b>shaken</b> his adversary's religious sentiment, leading Creangă to question the immortality of the soul in a letter he addressed to one of his relatives in the clergy. According to other assessments, he was himself an atheist, albeit intimately so.|$|E
2500|$|As {{an energy}} {{lobbyist}} in 1975, Shell fought the attempt of Governor Jerry Brown {{to repeal the}} [...] "depletion allowance," [...] a tax break for the state's oil industry. Brown aimed his fire at [...] "big oil" [...] {{in an era of}} popular environmental activism on the West Coast. The decisive vote against the allowance was cast in the California Senate by the usually pro-business Republican Senator Robert S. Stevens. Shell claimed that Stevens had promised him that he would support keeping the allowance: [...] "He <b>had</b> <b>shaken</b> my hand and told me he was with me." [...] recalled Shell, who considered a handshake a bond of honor. Brown later rewarded Stevens with a judicial appointment, but Stevens was driven from the bench for making salacious telephone calls.|$|E

Training for SOG's South Vietnamese agents, naval action teams, and indigenous mercenaries (usually Nùng or Montagnards of various tribes) was conducted at the ARVN Airborne training center (Camp Quyet Thang) located at Long Thành, southeast of Saigon.

2500|$|There is an {{interesting}} anecdote narrated about the 'one and quarter flag', which is the insignia flag of the Maharajas of Jaipur.

On this occasion, Jai Singh made an irreverent remark to the Emperor stating that the way he <b>had</b> <b>shaken</b> hands with him made it incumbent on the Emperor to protect him (Jai Singh) and his kingdom. Aurangzeb, instead of responding in indignation at the quip, felt pleased and conferred on the young Jai Singh the title of 'Sawai', which means [...] "one and a quarter".
