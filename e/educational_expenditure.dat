40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} whether or not the public sees local and national school systems in terms of efficiency. Both measures of confidence in education (national and local) were taken from national survey data between the years 1973 - 1996. Measures of educational efficiency were broken down into educational inputs, and educational outputs. Educational inputs were operationalized as per pupil expenditures from 1973 - 1996, and education outputs were operationalized as recentered Scholastic Assessment Scores (SAT) scores from 1973 - 1996. Two Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions were used to measure the effect of <b>educational</b> <b>expenditures</b> and SAT scores on confidence in both the national education system and local schools. Granger Causality Tests were done to test whether or not <b>educational</b> <b>expenditures</b> and SAT scores were causally related. The results of this study show that confidence in the national educational system is correlated with educational efficiency. As SAT scores increase and <b>educational</b> <b>expenditures</b> decrease, confidence in the national education system increases. Confidence in local schools was only indirectly tied to measures of educational efficiency. It increased as both SAT scores and <b>educational</b> <b>expenditures</b> increased. The implication of this finding is that efficiency is an important correlate of support for education at the national level, but not at the local level. The Granger Causality Tests showed no relationship between <b>educational</b> <b>expenditures</b> and SAT scores, verifying that these two efficiency measures are causally unrelated.

40|$|We {{construct}} a model, via <b>educational</b> <b>expenditure,</b> linking female labor supply to fertility and economic growth. Our paper includes three main themes.

Both home education and school education are inputs of the human capital production function. Second, the rising opportunity cost of having children discourages parental demand for children and encourages married women¡¯s participation. Finally, more investments in children¡¯s human capital result in a higher growth rate. Our model closely follows the process of demographic transition. In the developed stage, an economy with a high rate of <b>educational</b> <b>expenditure</b> has a low fertility rate, high female participation rate and perpetual growth.

40|$|Three essays {{focus on}} the various {{measurements}} of school quality and its importance in motivating people 2 ̆ 7 s location choices, their interest in school improvement, {{and their ability to}} fund additional school expenditures. The first essay examines hedonic housing price studies to dissect the mixed evidence on whether school quality affects housing prices. The chapter employs meta-regression analysis on 48 studies and finds that studies which measured school quality using any of eight measures, including <b>educational</b> <b>expenditures,</b> tend to find a positive correlation with housing prices. Additionally, published studies tend to find a higher correlation than unpublished studies. The second essay aims to remove the endogeneity bias between <b>educational</b> <b>expenditures</b> and inmigration with generalized propensity score methods. We restrict the study period to 2006 – 2010 and our focus to the population aged 25 – 49 years. We find that increases in <b>educational</b> <b>expenditures</b> {{have a positive effect on}} inmigration to U. S. counties up to 7, 000 but a generally flat effect beyond that. The third essay examines education tax referenda, which school districts propose to taxpayers to attain funding additional to their state-allocated funds. The chapter examines educational finance using sample selection methods to correct for school district decisions to enter the referenda proposal process and finds that few school districts take advantage of educational tax referenda, with rural school districts being more likely to do so than urban school districts. Additionally, the results suggest that racial diversity, competition from private schools and school district size significantly affect proposal and approval of referenda across rural and urban school districts. ...|$|R

"Female Policymakers and Educational Expenditures: Cross-Country Evidence" This paper investigates the influence of women in politics on decision-making using public <b>educational</b> <b>expenditures</b> as the outcome of interest. The results suggest that {{an increase in the}} share of female legislators by one percentage point increases the ratio of <b>educational</b> <b>expenditures</b> to GDP by 0. 028 percentage points. The effect of female legislators on educational policies is strengthened accounting for forms of government, but not influenced by left-wing government, electoral rules, parliamentary system and non-marriage. Moreover, this study supports the hypothesis that the identity of the legislator matters for policy. "Women in Politics: A New Instrument for Studying the Impact of Education on Growth" This paper tests the growth model of distance to the technological frontier, which states that an economy closer to the technological frontier should invest more in skilled labor since innovation is a skill-intensive activity. In contrast to Vandenbussche, Aghion, and Meghir (henceforth VAM) (2006), I use the proportion of female legislators as an instrument for skilled labor, instead of lagged <b>educational</b> <b>expenditures.</b> The results with the new instrument are consistent with the theoretical prediction and the previous results of VAM (2006). "Do Gender Quotas Influence Women's Representation and Policies?" This paper investigates the effect of applying gender quotas on policy decisions.
