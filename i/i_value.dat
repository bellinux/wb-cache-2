500|$|Darwin {{published}} On the Origin of Species on November24, 1859. The first printing was 1,250 copies, {{with some}} having {{been sent to}} America via ship; one of those was for Gray. Gray's copy arrived just before Christmas, and he read it between Christmas and New Year's. Since there was no international copyright law at the time, Gray worked to protect the book from publishing piracy. According to American law at the time, a copyright could only be secured by an American edition being published by an American citizen, and royalties {{were not required to}} be paid to the author. Gray arranged the first American edition of On the Origin of Species and was able to negotiate royalties on Darwin's behalf. Gray took a 5%royalty from the publisher, and Darwin was so grateful for Gray's efforts that he offered Gray some of his royalties. Darwin held Gray in high esteem: he dedicated his book Forms of Flowers (1877) to Gray, and he wrote in 1881, [...] "there is hardly any one in the world whose approbation <b>I</b> <b>value</b> more highly than I do yours." [...] Seeing the [...] "unity we perceive in nature" [...] and law in the universe, regarding all species he felt [...] "that they not only had a Creator but have a Governor." [...] Gray and Agassiz strongly disagreed; Agassiz was adamantly opposed to the idea of evolution, whereas Gray was a staunch supporter, believing in theistic evolution. As the debate raged over Darwin's theories, the rift between Gray and Agassiz grew deeper, and they were estranged by December 1863, when Gray was elected president of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, which also marked Agassiz' increasing isolation within the scientific community. Gray showed little interest in scientific politics and resigned from the National Academy of Sciences in 1867. In late 1866 Agassiz apologized to Gray and the two were at least civil to one another again.|$|E

40|$|Quantitative {{autoradiography}} of [3 H]MK- 801 binding {{was used}} to characterize regional differences in N -methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor pharmacology in rat CNS. Regionally distinct populations of NMDA receptors were distinguished {{on the basis of}} regulation of [3 H]MK- 801 binding by the NMDA antagonist 3 -(2 -carboxypiperazin- 4 -yl) -propyl- 1 -phosphonic acid (CPP). CPP inhibited [3 H]MK- 801 binding in outer cortex (OC) and medial cortex (MC) with apparent K <b>i</b> <b>values</b> of 0. 32 - 0. 48 Μ M, whereas in the medial striatum (MS), lateral striatum (LS), CA 1, and dentate gyrus (DG) of hippocampus, apparent K <b>i</b> <b>values</b> were 1. 1 - 1. 6 Μ M. In medial thalamus (MT) and lateral thalamus (LT) the apparent K <b>i</b> <b>values</b> were 0. 78 Μ M. In the presence of added glutamate (3 Μ M), the relative differences in apparent K <b>i</b> <b>values</b> between regions maintained a similar relationship {{with the exception of the}} OC. Inhibition of [3 H]MK- 801 binding by the glycine site antagonist 7 -chlorokynurenic acid (7 -ClKyn) distinguished at least two populations of NMDA receptors that differed from populations defined by CPP displacement. 7 -ClKyn inhibited [3 H]MK- 801 binding in OC, MC, MS, and LS with apparent K <b>i</b> <b>values</b> of 6. 3 - 8. 6 Μ M, whereas in CA 1, DG, LT, and MT, K <b>i</b> <b>values</b> were 11. 4 - 13. 6 Μ M. In the presence of added glycine (1 Μ M), the relative differences in apparent K <b>i</b> <b>values</b> were maintained. Under conditions of differential receptor activation, regional differences in NMDA receptor pharmacology can be detected using [3 H]MK- 801 binding...|$|R

2500|$|People with anxious-preoccupied {{attachment}} type tend {{to agree}} with the following statements: [...] "I want to be completely emotionally intimate with others, but I often find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would like", and [...] "I am uncomfortable being without close relationships, but I sometimes worry that others don't value me as much as <b>I</b> <b>value</b> them." [...] People with this style of attachment seek high levels of intimacy, approval, and responsiveness from their attachment figure. They sometimes value intimacy {{to such an extent that}} they become overly dependent on the attachment figure. Compared to securely attached people, people who are anxious or preoccupied with attachment tend to have less positive views about themselves. They may feel a sense of anxiousness that only recedes when in contact with the attachment figure. They often doubt their worth as a person and blame themselves for the attachment figure's lack of responsiveness. People who are anxious or preoccupied with attachment may exhibit high levels of emotional expressiveness, emotional dysregulation (ED), worry, and impulsiveness in their relationships.|$|E
2500|$|Hall {{joined the}} cast of Saturday Night Live (SNL) during its 1985–86 season {{at the age of}} 17. He was, and remains, the {{youngest}} cast member in the show's history. His recurring characters on the show were Craig Sundberg, Idiot Savant, an intelligent, talented teenager with a vacant expression and stilted speech, and Fed Jones, half of the habitually high, hustling pitchmen known as The Jones Brothers. (The other Jones Brother was played by short-lived featured player Damon Wayans). Art Garfunkel, Edd Byrnes, Robert F. Kennedy, and Daryl Hall were among Hall's celebrity impersonations. Hall had admired the show and its stars as a child, but he found the SNL environment to be far more competitive than he had imagined. [...] "My year there, I didn't have any breakout characters and I didn't really do the things I dreamed I would do," [...] he said, [...] "but I still learned a lot, and <b>I</b> <b>value</b> that.
