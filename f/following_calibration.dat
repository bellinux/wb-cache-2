30|$|Polynomial {{calibration}} methods [13 – 16] {{build the}} relationship of phase and depth by fitting a polynomial through N pairs of known phases and depths for every pixel. Usually, a plate with discrete markers with known separations is positioned successively at different positions from the camera. A marked point on the first calibration plate is used as {{the origin of the}} world reference system; then the <b>following</b> <b>calibration</b> plates are chosen parallel to the first one. In this method, their displacements with respect to the first plane must be known. To obtain high accuracy, more plate positions are used to cover the measurement volumes and the order of the polynomial should be more than five, which means that there are too many coefficients to calculate. The main drawback of this calibration method comes from its practical limitations, such as its plate position restriction, the difficulty of calibrating a large measurement volume, and the long running time of processing and capturing the fringe pattern image data.|$|E
