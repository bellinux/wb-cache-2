40|$|Background: Migrant farmworkers {{are prone}} to several psychosocial stressors. Objective: To {{investigate}} the effect of perceived psychosocial factors on pesticide exposure among seasonal migrant Hispanic farmworkers in North Carolina, USA. Methods: A cross-sectional interview survey of 187 seasonal migrant farmworkers of Mexican descent, identified from labor camps located in rural counties in North Carolina, was conducted using nonprobability purposive sampling approach. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression {{analysis was used to}} determine the relationship between perceived control over the <b>harmful</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> exposure, lack of social support, and the impact of anxiety on perception of pesticide exposure. Results: More than 20 % (n= 39) of farmworkers reported frequent or constant contact with pesticides while working in the fields. More than 68 % of farmworkers reported they believe they have control over avoiding <b>harmful</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> exposure; the odds of pesticide exposure were 55 % lower in this group (adjusted OR: 0. 45; 95 % CI: 0. 22 – 0. 91). No significant relationship was observed between farmworkers perception of lack of social support and presence of anxiety with odds of on-field pesticide exposure. Conclusion: The study results suggest that perception of control is an important predictor of reduced pesticide exposure among seasonal migrant farmworkers...|$|E

40|$|PROBLEM: Irrigated {{agriculture}} exposes rural {{people to}} health {{risks associated with}} vector-borne diseases and pesticides used in agriculture and for public health protection. Most developing countries lack collaboration between the agricultural and health sectors to jointly address these problems. APPROACH: We present an evaluation of a project that uses the "farmer field school" method to teach farmers how to manage vector-borne diseases and how to improve rice yields. Teaching farmers about these two concepts together is known as "integrated pest and vector management". LOCAL SETTING: An intersectoral project targeting rice irrigation systems in Sri Lanka. RELEVANT CHANGES: Project partners developed a new curriculum for the field school that included a component on vector-borne diseases. Rice farmers in intervention villages who graduated from the field school took vector-control actions as well as improving environmental sanitation and their personal protection measures against disease transmission. They also reduced their use <b>of</b> agricultural <b>pesticides,</b> especially insecticides.

A differential two-level diagnostic test system was established under controlled conditions usingpeas (Pisum sativum L.) as test plants. Soils from 22 organically managed sites with unexplained moderate to high pea yield losses were tested in level 1 diagnostics (y-irradiation to eliminate potentiallyharmful organisms, nutrient additions to compensate for potential nutrient deficiencies or activated charcoal amendment to bind and thereby to immobilize potentially phytotoxic compounds). Results showedthat organisms harmful to the test plant were the primary cause of limited germination and growth inmost of the sampled soils, whereas a positive <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> nutrient addition was rarely found and toxinswere not involved. Level 2 diagnostics (pesticides targeting ascomycetes, oomycetes, Rhizoctonia spp.,nematodes) further narrowed down the organisms involved in yield depressions. Oomycetes were identified as the primary reason for limited germination rates, and, in some soils, also for limited growth ofestablished seedlings.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the in-situ precipitation of polyelectrolytes during droplet impacts and its applications in enhancing the retention efficiency of sprays. Large amounts of agricultural sprays are wasted worldwide, due to the poor retention on hydrophobic plants. As the <b>harmful</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> in particular are more and more pointed out, there is an increasing pressure to reduce their use and make their spraying more efficient. Current solutions, mainly based on surfactants, all have limitations. Here, we present a novel idea based on the modification of the surface of the plant. By precipitating opposite polyelectrolytes, in-situ, we create sparse pinning sites that pin the contact lines of the impacting droplets from the spray and prevent them from bouncing off. We first study the behavior of the impact of two droplets containing oppositely charged polyelectrolytes on a hydrophobic surface. We then study the precipitation process of two polyelectrolytes and develop a model that predicts the outcome of a double drop impact. Finally, we show the macroscopic applications of this study, by using simultaneous spraying. Simultaneously spraying dilute opposite polyelectrolytes on a superhydrophobic surface leads to a large increase in the liquid retention and the coverage of the surface. The behavior has been shown to hold for different polyelectrolytes and surfaces, making this method suitable for a range of applications. by Maher Damak. Thesis: S.

Various methods have been discussed in order to solve this problem. One of these meth-ods is using chemicals against harmful organisms in plants. The use <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> in agricultural areas increases the plant yield; however, some chemical substances may result in pollution in nature and health problems. The <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> used in high concen-trations in the world have been dealt with and investigated by various researchers from differ-ent aspects.

Detrimental <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> fungicide sprays on fruit set and yield in crops such as cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) were reported (Özgen and Palta 2001). Furthermore, it was stated that pesticides had often prevented cell division (Yoshida et al. 1983). A lot of work was done to study the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> fungicides on pollen germination and pollen tube growth (He et al. 1995). <b>Harmful</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> fungicides on pollen germination (Watters and Sturgeon 1990) and pollen tube growth (Marcucci et al. 1983) were demonstrated for commercially important plants. Although many studies have been conducted on the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> fungicides on pollen germination and pollen tube growth, very few studies have been carried out handling the impact of fungicides on the pollen morphology and viability.

40|$|Organisms are {{frequently}} exposed to mixtures of chemical contaminants in the environment, causing a potential "cocktail effect", or combined effect.

A number of recent publications by the European Commission and the authorities in charge prove the increasing interest that is spreading in the European community towards the topic of the assessment of chemical mixtures. The current EU regulation for Plant Protection Products authorization (Reg. 1107 / 2009 EC) explicitly requires the evaluation of the potential combined <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> active substances. We reviewed current methods and limitations of mixture assessment <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> (7 fungicides and 4 herbicides) through the analysis of the approaches adopted to investigate possible risks for different non-target organisms. The Concentration Addition (CA) approach was the most used approach to predict multiple toxicity to non-target organisms. The guidance for birds and mammals first introduced standard procedures to assess the multiple toxicity based on on CA concept. The recent aquatic EFSA guidance introduced some requirements to evaluate potential mixture toxicity, while the current guidance requirements for terrestrial organisms still lack clear indications on how to conduct the assessment. Moreover, new indications come from the draft guidance for the assessment of terrestrial plants and in-soil organisms. However, the approval and implementation of these new guidelines are still at a developmental stage.

The data were obtained from farmworkers using a combination of an open-ended and a close-ended structured questionnaire in July 2006. Of the nine farms serviced by the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security of Lesotho, Agricultural Research Division, six farms were randomly chosen and 27 farmworkers from these farms were interviewed. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics such as frequency tables. The results showed that farmworkers are relatively poorly educated and that a greater health risk is present when a lack of training and education on the use <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> also exists. That is, the majority (85 %) of farmworkers did not have secondary education and most (93 %) had no training on the use <b>of</b> <b>pesticides,</b> which poses a great health threat to the farmworkers. A lack of education makes it difficult for farmworkers to read and understand the information labels on pesticides and hence it is difficult for them to understand the health hazards <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> and the need for personal safety measures. When using and handling <b>pesticides,</b> 52 % <b>of</b> farmworkers did not use rubber gloves and 93 % did not use goggles or other forms of face cover. This lack of protection puts them at serious risk of skin exposure to pesticides. The farmworkers were quite aware <b>of</b> the <b>harmful</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides,</b> but were sometimes unable to translate this awareness into their own safety practices because of a lack of knowledge about the adverse effects.

The approval process for agricultural pesticides {{that can be used in}} agriculture is a continuous one and we can expect additional important a. i. to be withdrawn, as has been seen with the EC decision in April 2013, to ban three neonicotinoid insecticides (NNIs) for two years. The EU Pesticide Reduction Strategy responds to public concern and medical evidence about the <b>harmful</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> on human health. While most people would agree that we should try to minimise the use <b>of</b> conventional <b>pesticides</b> in our environment, there is considerable controversy over where the balance should be struck, between risk and benefit. The debate is highly polarised, between those who think the risk <b>of</b> harm from <b>pesticides</b> is already being managed by strict regulation of their use and, those who think that a precautionary approach should be adopted and that potential hazard is a reasonable criterion for removal. The agricultural industry, including most farmers, argue that further pesticide removals will result in significant decreases in European food production and, therefore, higher food prices. Environmental and other campaigning organizations such as Friends of the Earth, the Soil Association and The Pesticide Action Network, believe that the rate of removal of the most 'hazardous' pesticides should be increased and that there should be much less use of 'derogations'...|$|R
40|$|Among the chemicals, {{pesticides}} {{which are}} mainly used in agriculture pose major health problems to human beings. Indiscriminate use <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> {{belonging to the}} class organophosphate, organochlorine, carbomate, and pyrethroid leads to various health problems affecting the nervous, endocrine, reproductive and immune systems. The toxicity <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> in human beings is influenced by {{various factors such as}} age, gender and health status of the individual in addition to the intensity and frequency <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> used. Comparatively, children are at greater risk than the adults. The human detoxification system plays a vital role in reducing the <b>harmful</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pesticides.</b> However, when the toxic level is increased beyond the capacity of the detoxification system, health condition deteriorates. Human diet plays a crucial role in maintaining the overall health of a person. Vitamins such as Vitamin C and E are effective in preventing DNA damage because of their antioxidant properties. Intake of fruits and vegetables improves the antioxidants level in the blood. Phenolic substances present in certain spices possess potent anticarcinogenic activities. Organic farming may be a viable solution to reduce the toxic <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> chemicals...|$|R
40|$|Epidemiological studies {{report that}} {{exposure}} to pesticides like chlordecone and lindane increases risk of cancer. They may act as endocrine disruptors via the activation of estrogen receptor α (ERα). Carcinogenesis involved angiogenesis and no available data regarding these organochlorines have been reported. The present study aimed at investigating the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> lindane and chlordecone on cellular processes leading to angiogenesis through an involvement of ERα. Angiogenesis has been analyzed both in vitro, on human endothelial cells, and in vivo by quantifying neovascularization {{with the use of}} ECMgel® plug in mice. Both pesticides increased endothelial cell proliferation, migration and MMP 2 activity. These toxics potentiated cell adhesion by enhancing FAK phosphorylation and stress fibers. The two organochlorines increased nitric oxide production via an enhancement of eNOS activity without modification of oxidative stress. Evidence has been provided that the two toxins increased in vivo neovascularization. Most interestingly, all the above processes were either partially or completely prevented after silencing of ERα. Altogether, these data highlight that organochlorines modulate cellular angiogenic processes through activation of ERα. This study further reinforces the <b>harmful</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> these <b>pesticides</b> in carcinogenesis, particularly in the modulation of angiogenesis, a critical step in tumor promotion, through ERα...|$|R
40|$|This study {{assessed}} the <b>harmful</b> and beneficial <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> use in maize production. It also {{assessed the}} knowledge, attitude {{and practice of}} farmers about the use <b>of</b> <b>pesticides.</b> Data for the study were collected from 120 randomly sampled maize farmers across nine (9) local government areas of Oyo state. Majority (65 %) found pesticides to be harmful while 39 per cent {{found it to be}} beneficial. Results further shows diverse attitude <b>of</b> farmers to <b>pesticide</b> use. About 95 per cent make use of hygienic practices while large numbers (66 %) neglect safety rules due to poor education and awareness. Overall, there is evidence of excessive use <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> by farmers which consequently affects their health negatively. The use <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> is also found to contaminate water body. Major policy thrusts for devising pesticide regulation and effective implementation, increasing farmers’ awareness <b>of</b> the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> use, and increase provision safety materials are suggested to safeguard maize farmers in their pursuit of agricultural livelihoods...|$|R
30|$|It was however {{interesting}} to note that some cocoa farmers who benefited and used the approved and recommended Ghana COCOBOD pesticides indicated that pesticides in the open market (unapproved pesticides) were more effective than the approved ones. Although cocoa farmers claim unapproved pesticides are more effective compared to the approved and recommended Ghana COCOBOD pesticides, research by the Ghana COCOBOD reveals that approved and recommended pesticides are not harmful to pollinator insects of cocoa, for example, midges (Forcipomyia spp.) (COCOBOD 2014). Also, unapproved pesticides used in the cocoa industry are not screened at the Cocoa Research Institute of Ghana, to ensure that they comply with EU, Japanese and other markets requirements for food safety, maximum residual level (MRL) limits and sanitary and phyto-sanitary standards before they are used on cocoa, which could lead to the rejection of cocoa beans exported to these markets when traces/residues of these chemicals are found in the beans (Ghana News 2013). There is therefore, the need to educate cocoa farmers on the <b>harmful</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> these unapproved <b>pesticides</b> on cocoa production.|$|R
40|$|Worldwide, {{growing concern}} about the <b>harmful</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> on humans and non-target organisms has {{resulted}} in an increasing demand from international markets for fruit that is produced using sustainable management systems. This study measured the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> fungicides on population density and species richness of phylloplane microorganisms in apple orchards under different management systems. A secondary objective was to identify {{one or a few}} microorganisms that could be easily recognised by colony morphology and be used as bioindicators of sustainable orchard management. During the 1998 / 1999 season, a sampling, isolation and enumeration method was developed that determined the amount of natural variation in microorganism populations among trees, among locations within trees and between spring and autumn, in an unsprayed orchard. The results showed that during spring, the variation among trees, locations within trees, and dilution plates were responsible for 49, 39 and 12 percent, respectively, of the total variation. During autumn, the variation among trees, locations within trees, shoots, and dilution plates were responsible for 34, 0, 49 and 17 percent, respectively of the total variation. The information gained from the first study was used to modify the methods, which were used in a second study in 1999 / 2000, to compare microorganism populations from apple orchards under different management systems, at four times during the season. Three orchards followed ENZA-IFP (Integrated Fruit Production) requirements for export, three produced for the local market (IFP-local market) and two produced apples organically, complying with BIO-GRO standards. An unsprayed orchard was also included in the study. The results showed that populations increased during the season, by factors of 11, 47, 774 and 80 for bacteria, 'smooth yeasts', Aureobasidium spp. and filamentous fungi, respectively. Throughout the season, population densities of bacteria and 'smooth yeasts' were similar in all orchards (1 x 10 ⁵ to 1 X 10 ⁶ colony forming units per leaf [CFU/leaf]), whereas those of Aureobasidium spp. and filamentous fungi were lower in IFP orchards (about 1 x 10 ³ and 1 x 10 ⁴ CFU/leaf respectively) than in BIO-GRO and unsprayed orchards (3 x 10 ⁴ and 1 x 10 ⁵ CFU/leaf respectively). The mean species richness (number of recognisable taxonomic units per sample [RTU/sample]) varied from 5. 3 in IFP orchards to 6. 6 in the BIO-GRO and unsprayed orchards, but species richness was lower in IFP orchards (5) than in BIO-GRO and unsprayed orchards (13) during spring, and it increased during the season and became similar to that of BIO-GRO orchards in autumn. In a third study, the direct <b>effects</b> were determined <b>of</b> the fungicides, captan, copper hydroxide, myclobutanil, dodine, inorganic sulphur and a fish-based foliar fertiliser, on phylloplane microorganism populations. Products were sprayed four times during the 1999 / 2000 season, and the microorganism populations assessed immediately before treatment and at 1, 3 and 7 days after treatment. With all microorganisms combined there were significant differences (P≤ 0. 05) in the level of increase or decrease in microorganism populations among the four treatment dates, but differences among products were only significant at P≤ 0. l. 'Smooth yeasts', filamentous fungi and species richness, showed significant (P≤ 0. 05) changes in population densities due to foliar treatments. Although this trend was observed only in a few (3 / 60) cases, this indicates that a single isolated foliar application of a chemical product can affect microbial population densities and species richness. The <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> repetitive fungicide applications, different products and product combinations and insecticide use on non-target microorganism as applied in commercial situations requires further investigation. During the second and third study, Cladosporium spp. were identified as having potential to be suitable indicators of sustainable orchard management, because they were present in most orchards, during most of the growing season, and most often showed a significant response to orchard management systems and fungicide treatments...|$|R
40|$|Many {{insects are}} {{important}} agricultural pests, and active control {{is necessary to}} keep them at abeyance. The naturally occurring entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium is a promising tool to control pest insects, and its use avoids the well-known <b>harmful</b> side <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> chemical <b>pesticides.</b> Thousands <b>of</b> unique isolates of Metarhizium exist throughout the world. These isolates vary widely {{in their ability to}} cause infection and to tolerate stressful habitats. The research reported here tests the THESIS: A laboratory-based system can be devised that identifies, from among many Metarhizium isolates, those isolates with the greatest potential for successful biological control of pest insects in the field. The study was built on the testing of four hypotheses: (1) Laboratory bioassays using target pest insects will distinguish highly virulent strains of Metarhizium from less virulent strains, (2) Quantity and quality of mass-produced pathogenic fungi will vary among species and strains of Metarhizium, (3) The tolerance to ultraviolet radiation will vary among species and strains of Metarhizium, (4) The <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> temperature on growth rates and survival of both Metarhizium spores and hyphae will vary among isolates and species. These hypotheses test four field-relevant traits using a panel of ten isolates of Metarhizium isolates. 	Seven sets of laboratory experiments were devised to define the range of responses within the traits covered by the hypotheses. This series of general laboratory tests was developed to assist in identifying fungal isolates with high potential for field use. These tests included evaluation of each isolate 2 ̆ 7 s (a) insect pathogenicity, (b) mass–production capabilities, (c) tolerance to high temperatures, (d) tolerance to UV-B radiation, (e) rate of vegetative growth, (f) rate of spore germination, and (g) an evaluation of presence or absence of a post–stress growth inhibition. The application of this protocol to the isolates used in this study indicates that four isolates have high field potential, i. e., DWR 203, DWR 346, DWR 356 and ARSEF 324, and three of these were tested in a field trial. By following the procedures outlined in this thesis, selection of “good” isolates can be accomplished in the laboratory, and a successful isolate can be identified from the abundance of isolates present in nature...|$|R
