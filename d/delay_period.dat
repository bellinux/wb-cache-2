25|$|Increment, {{invented by}} Bobby Fischer. When {{it becomes a}} player's turn to move, the delay {{is added to the}} player's {{remaining}} time. For example, if the delay is five seconds and the player has ten minutes remaining on his clock, when his clock is activated, he now has ten minutes and five seconds remaining. Time can be accumulated, so if the player moves within the <b>delay</b> <b>period,</b> his remaining time actually increases. This style of time control is common on internet chess servers.|$|E
25|$|One {{study found}} that during {{atomization}} biodiesel and its blends produced droplets were greater in diameter than the droplets produced by traditional petrodiesel. The smaller droplets were attributed to the lower viscosity and surface tension of traditional petrol. It was found that droplets at {{the periphery of the}} spray pattern were larger in diameter than the droplets at the center this was attributed to the faster pressure drop {{at the edge of the}} spray pattern; there was a proportional relationship between the droplet size and the distance from the injector tip. It was found that B100 had the greatest spray penetration, this was attributed to the greater density of B100. Having a greater droplet size can lead to; inefficiencies in the combustion, increased emissions, and decreased horse power. In another study it was found that there is a short injection delay when injecting biodiesel. This injection delay was attributed to the greater viscosity of Biodiesel. It was noted that the higher viscosity and the greater cetane rating of biodiesel over traditional petrodiesel lead to poor atomization, as well as mixture penetration with air during the ignition <b>delay</b> <b>period.</b> Another study noted that this ignition delay may aid in a decrease of NOx emission.|$|E

2500|$|Simple delay (also {{known as}} {{countdown}} delay and US delay). When {{it becomes a}} player's turn to move, the clock waits for the <b>delay</b> <b>period</b> before starting to subtract from the player's remaining time. For example, if the delay is five seconds, the clock waits for five seconds before counting down. The time is not accumulated. If the player moves within the <b>delay</b> <b>period,</b> no time is added or subtracted from his remaining time. There is also Bronstein delay which handles how the delay is shown on the screen differently but is mathematically equivalent to simple delay.|$|E
2500|$|EF-Tu {{contributes}} to translational accuracy in three ways. [...] In translation, a fundamental {{problem is that}} near-cognate anticodons have similar binding affinity to a codon as cognate anticodons, such that anticodon-codon binding in the ribosome alone {{is not sufficient to}} maintain high translational fidelity. [...] This is addressed by the ribosome not activating the GTPase activity of EF-Tu if the tRNA in the ribosome's A-site does not match the mRNA codon, thus preferentially increasing the likelihood for the incorrect tRNA to leave the ribosome. [...] Additionally, regardless of tRNA matching, EF-Tu also induces a delay after freeing itself from the aa-tRNA, before the aa-tRNA fully enters the A-site (a process called accommodation). [...] This <b>delay</b> <b>period</b> is a second opportunity for incorrectly charged aa-tRNAs {{to move out of the}} A-site before the incorrect amino acid is irreversibly added to the polypeptide chain. [...] A third mechanism is the less well understood function of EF-Tu to crudely check aa-tRNA associations and reject complexes where the amino acid is not bound to the correct tRNA coding for it.|$|E
2500|$|Odor {{recognition}} {{is the most}} common and direct means used to measure odor memory. In an odor recognition test participants are asked whether or not they recognize an odor. [...] More specifically, a participant is subjected to a certain olfactory-related stimulus, and after a <b>delay</b> <b>period</b> is asked to decide if a probe (a stimulus that could or could not be the same as the initial stimulus) {{is the same as the}} one he/she initially encountered. Memory accuracy is assessed by the amount of correct recognition decisions that are made. A potential problem with this measure involves the generation of verbal labels that may enhance memory for olfactory stimuli. [...] There are various ways of measuring the effect of verbal labeling, which include comparison of odors and odor names, as well as the speed and accuracy with which lexical decisions are made regarding odor names. It has been suggested that odor recognition testing should be considered as a measure that involves both memory for perceptual information as well as potentially confounding memory due to the generation of verbal labels.|$|E

5000|$|According to {{hyperbolic}} discounting, valuations fall relatively rapidly for earlier <b>delay</b> <b>periods</b> (as in, {{from now}} to one week), but then fall more slowly for longer <b>delay</b> <b>periods</b> (for instance, {{more than a}} few days). For example, in an early study subjects said they would be indifferent between receiving $15 immediately or $30 after 3 months, $60 after 1 year, or $100 after 3 years.

2500|$|Dota 2 is a {{multiplayer}} online battle arena {{video game}} (MOBA) {{developed by the}} Valve Corporation. In it, two teams of five players compete by selecting pre-designed in-game hero characters, each {{with a variety of}} innate skills and deploy-able powers, and cooperating together to destroy the base of the other team before their own base is destroyed as to win the round. The game is played from a top-down perspective, and the player sees a segment of the game's map near their character as well as mini-map that shows their allies as well as any enemies revealed outside the fog of war. The game's map has three symmetric [...] "lanes" [...] between each base, with a number of automated defense turrets protecting each side. Periodically, the team's base will spawn an army of weak non-playable minions that will march down one lane towards the opponents' base, fighting any enemy hero, minion, or structure they encounter. If a hero character is killed, that character will respawn back at their base after a <b>delay</b> <b>period,</b> which gets progressively longer the farther into the match. The game is a free-to-play, but financially supported by Valve with a variety of microtransactions such as cosmetic items for its heroes. As with previous years of the tournament, a corresponding digital compendium for Dota 2 was released before the event, allowing the prize pool to be crowdfunded. Known as the [...] "Battle Pass", 25% of revenue made by it was sent directly towards the tournament's prize pool.|$|E
5000|$|Bronstein delay, {{invented by}} David Bronstein. This time method {{results in the}} same usage of time as the simple delay.

Under this model, valuations fall very rapidly for small <b>delay</b> <b>periods,</b> but then fall slowly for longer <b>delay</b> <b>periods.</b> This better explains why most people who would choose 1 candy bar now over 2 candy bars tomorrow, would, in fact, choose 2 candy bars received after 101 days rather than the 1 candy bar received after 100 days which EU assumes.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to reveal possible common and specific neuroendocrine mechanisms of depressionand anxiety-like states in rodents. Animal models of depression and anxiety (in particular, posttraumatic stress disorder, PTSD) were applied including the learned helplessness and the stress-restress paradigms, respectively. Immunocytochemical staining revealed that depressive- and anxiety-like states in animals were accompanied by the rise in corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) immunoreactivity in the parvocellular division of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Decrease in vasopressin-immunoreactivity in early period of depressive-like state development was followed by the normalization of vasopressin content in the hypothalamic PVN in <b>delayed</b> <b>period.</b> Increased CRH and vasopressin immunoreactivity in the magnocellular part of the PVN in <b>delayed</b> <b>period</b> of anxiety-like state development was detected only in the stress-restress paradigm.

Neurosci. 9 : 166. doi: 10. 3389 /fnsys. 2015. 00166 Working {{memory is}} a type of {{short-term}} memory which has a crucial cognitive function that supports ongoing and upcoming behaviors, allowing storage of information across <b>delay</b> <b>periods.</b> The content of this memory may typically include tangible information about features such as the shape, color or texture of an object, and its location and motion relative to the body, as well as phonological information.

In particular, neuronal activity in prefrontal areas encodes task-related information corresponding to working memory across <b>delay</b> <b>periods,</b> and lesions in the prefrontal cortex severely affect the ability to retain this type of memory.

50|$|Accelerated curing {{techniques}} invariably involve high temperatures. This {{may induce}} thermal stresses in the concrete. Further, {{the water in}} the pores starts to exert pressure at higher temperatures. The combined effect of the pore pressure and thermal stresses causes a tensile stress within the body of the concrete. If the accelerated curing process is begun immediately after the concrete has been poured, then the concrete {{will not be able to}} withstand the tensile stresses as it requires time to gain some strength. Moreover, these microcracks formed may then lead to the delayed formation of ettringite, which is formed by the transformation of metastable monosulfate. Delayed ettringite formation (DEF) induces expansion in the concrete thereby weakening it. DEF is promoted by the formation of the cracks which enables the easy entry of water. Therefore, a <b>delay</b> <b>period</b> is allowed to elapse before the commencement of the curing process to allow the concrete to gain a certain minimum tensile strength. The setting time of the concrete is an important criterion to determine the <b>delay</b> <b>period.</b> Generally, the <b>delay</b> <b>period</b> is equal to the initial setting time which has been found to give satisfactory results.

50|$|The first {{insights}} into the neuronal and neurotransmitter basis of working memory came from animal research. The work of Jacobsen and Fulton in the 1930s first showed that lesions to the PFC impaired spatial working memory performance in monkeys. The later work of Joaquin Fuster recorded the electrical activity of neurons in the PFC of monkeys while they were doing a delayed matching task. In that task, the monkey sees how the experimenter places a bit of food under one of two identical-looking cups. A shutter is then lowered for a variable <b>delay</b> <b>period,</b> screening off the cups from the monkey's view. After the delay, the shutter opens and the monkey is allowed to retrieve the food from under the cups. Successful retrieval in the first attempt - something the animal can achieve after some training on the task - requires holding {{the location of the}} food in memory over the <b>delay</b> <b>period.</b> Fuster found neurons in the PFC that fired mostly during the <b>delay</b> <b>period,</b> suggesting that they were involved in representing the food location while it was invisible. Later research has shown similar delay-active neurons also in the posterior parietal cortex, the thalamus, the caudate, and the globus pallidus. The work of Goldman-Rakic and others showed that principal sulcal, dorsolateral PFC interconnects with all of these brain regions, and that neuronal microcircuits within PFC are able to maintain information in working memory through recurrent excitatory glutamate networks of pyramidal cells that continue to fire throughout the <b>delay</b> <b>period.</b> These circuits are tuned by lateral inhibition from GABAergic interneurons. The neuromodulatory arousal systems markedly alter PFC working memory function; for example, either too little or too much dopamine or norepinephrine impairs PFC network firing and working memory performance.|$|E
