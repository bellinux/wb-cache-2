25|$|The {{momentum}} {{to create a}} new honour typically originates at either the Chancellery of Honours or the Department of National Defence, though private organisations or individuals may also make proposals. The chancellery will investigate whether or not the suggested honour is necessary and if it will conform within the national honours structure. Should it meet these criteria, the notion is put before the <b>Honours</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee—a group of senior public servants, formed in 1980 within the Privy Council Office—and then, if approved, is moved before the Cabinet for an Order in Council to be drawn up. On the prime minister's advice, via the governor general, the documents and drawings for the new honour are presented to the Queen for her consideration; only with her signature on the relevant letters patent and the design sketches does the new honour officially become extant. Any future amendments to the honour's appearance or award criteria do not need the monarch's approval; the governor general will perform such tasks instead.|$|R

The introduction of a plan for dealing with the land was not very popular even among ministers, but it was pressed by Lord Spencer and the Irish secretary, on the double ground that the land was too burning a question to be left where it then stood, and next that it was unfair to a new and untried legislature in Ireland to find itself confronted by such a question on the very threshold.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines duelling {{crimes in}} Sweden {{during the first}} half of the 18 th century. During this period such crimes could involve verbal insults concerning honour as well as duelling, resulting in death. Inspired by the methods and perspectives of New Cultural History and by theories of masculinity the study argues that masculine violence is a cultural category that is historically developed. The focus is on the discourses that defined the legitimacy of masculine violence and honour in its cultural and historical context as well as elucidating perceptions of masculinity related to these. Based on texts such as legal Acts, judicial records, verdicts, defence and prosecution Acts, letters of remission, Royal Council protocols and forensic reports this thesis highlights how the judicial discourse involving crimes of duelling included discourses and values of the time and how these expressed an understanding of violence and masculinity. In their argumentation in court the various actors employed discourses of their time such as religion, an advanced jurisprudence, perceptions of virtue and <b>honour,</b> <b>policies</b> involving penalty, and to a certain extent their knowledge of medicine, health, and the human body. This study has shown that the judicial argumentation on justified and unjustified violence in crimes of duelling above all had its origin in a Christian, hegemonic cultural perception where binary oppositions of good and bad are combined with jurisprudence. Contemporary research has maintained that much discourse concerning violence has defined the borders of masculinity in contrast of what is regarded as feminine and emasculated. This study argues how in the early 18 th centuries the discourse of peace and non-violence, based on the jurisprudence of the time as well as on the narratives of the New Testament that preached a Christian lifestyle and love, constituted the argumentation in court and also the image of the masculine ideal. However, duels and breaches of honour need to be understood as expressions of an masculine culture of honour rather than a religious practice, which elucidates how early modern conceptions of masculinity spanned over a wide range from the most peaceful, meek and forgiving to the militant and violent. This specific honour consisted of components derived from the prevailing cultural perceptions of morality, notions of gender, combined with an aristocratic ideology. Possible reasons for a duellist to make use of insults, challenges to duel and violence were disrespectful treatment in the public arena, calling in question a military person's role, and accusations of lying and spreading of rumours...|$|R

The findings indicate that software such as Turnitin. com may assist in the quest to detect text-matching, and perhaps reduce plagiarism. It should not, however, be considered the panacea for plagiarism. Plagiarism policies should also reflect cognisance of the existence of a 2 ̆ 7 plagiarism continuum 2 ̆ 7 (Sutherland-Smith, 2003) through the use of technology.

40|$|On 26 May 1997 {{the report}} of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families, {{entitled}} Bringing Them Home, was tabled in parliament. It received widespread publicity the following day at the Australian Reconciliation Convention in Melbourne and led to continuing public and parliamentary debate about the implementation of its recommendations. A key recommendation in the report was that reparation be made to Indigenous people affected by policies of forced removal. That reparation should include an acknowledgement of responsibility and apology from all Australian parliaments and other agencies which implemented policies of forcible removal as well as monetary compensation. State and territory parliaments have apologised specifically to those affected by the policies of separation. Under the Howard government the Commonwealth parliament did not agree to a full apology but expressed ‘deep and sincere regret’ for unspecified past injustices as part of a Motion of Reconciliation on 26 August 1999. Since elected to government in 2007 the Australian Labor Party has announced that it will <b>honour</b> its <b>policy</b> of an unreserved apology to the stolen generations but has rejected any suggestions to compensate victims. These two components of reparation, an apology and compensation, remain as the major unfinished business of the Bringing Them Home report.

Other than the reviewed Self-determination theory, a new factors model has developed to hypothesized the factors positioning and compared with the research result model in four directions, which are the positive cognitive effect, negative cognitive effect, positive behavioral effect and negative behavioral effect; while, the effect of government support being the most controversial factor. The perception and determination shows that the image of academic achievement and the support from parents are being the most common significant effects. The relationships between factors have also being discussed in the research with the community acceptance being the central component. Whereas, synchronize swimming is being a team sport and having a lower popularity in Hong Kong, it shows enormous constraint in sports career engagement compare to swimming. At last, practical suggestions are offered for eliminating the constraints and burden of sport career engagement.

50|$|Sir Guy {{noted that}} nothing could be changed in any Articles that were {{inconsistent}} with prior <b>policies</b> or National <b>Honour.</b> He added that the only mode was {{to pay for the}} Negroes, in which case justice was done to all, the former slaves and the owners.

To provide for such a contingency, he had a register kept of all Negroes who left, called the Book of Negroes, entering their names, ages, occupations, and names of their former masters. The Americans agreed to this, but as far as can be determined, the Crown never paid compensation. The British transported about 3,000 freedmen and other Loyalists to Nova Scotia for resettlement. As the colony struggled, some of the freedmen later chose in the early 1790s to go to Freetown, Sierra Leone, where the British set up a new colony, which included the Black Poor from London.|$|R

Australian governments have often made use of public inquiries or reviews {{to assist them in}} these respects. The results, however, have been mixed. Based on theory and evidence, including insights gained at first hand, Professor Gary Banks addressed two key questions: Why might public inquiries contribute to better policy outcomes?

40|$|This {{research}} aims at (1) {{comparing the}} relations of walkability attributes and elderly’s Sense of Community (SofC) between two constituencies in Hong Kong, and (2) comparing the impacts of objective walkability and perceived walkability attributes on elderly’s SofC in two constituencies. In the constituency with higher perceived walkability, Accessibility and Walking Facilities were positively correlated with SofC at significant level. Walking Barriers were also positively correlated with elderly’s SofC, which suggested that hillsides and stairs increased elderly’s SofC, though {{it was out of}} significant level. In the constituency with higher Objective Walkability, Land-use mix, Commercial land use ratio and Connectivity were negatively correlated with SofC. Congestion was also higher in this constituency, which was consistent with the result of Objective Walkability. Comparing the impacts of socio-demographic data, perceived walkability and objective walkability attributes on SofC, objective walkability attributes were not important in explaining SofC in both constituencies. Socio-demographic data had limited influence on SofC, that elderly who were not born in Hong Kong and not living alone had a higher SofC level. The research can help provide officials and urban planners with some insights {{to pay more attention to}} the perception of the elderly, instead of simply following the objective standard of a so called “walkable environment”.

40|$|Standard form {{contracts}} are drafted in advance by the supplier of {{goods or services}} and presented to the consumer on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. The consumer’s only choice is to adhere to, or refuse to adhere to, {{the terms of the}} standard form contracts. They have various advantages for both contracting parties such as cost saving and uniformity. They also have some disadvantages as they are one-sided against consumers and impose unfair terms to the contracting party. Once a contract is signed, it must be <b>honoured.</b> However, public <b>policy</b> can be used to rescue the person from greatly unfair obligations that arise from the contracts. Public policy derives from the Constitution and the fundamental values it enshrines. Consequently, a contractual term that violates the Constitution is contrary to public policy and unenforceable. The Consumer Protection Act (CPA) has a significant impact on standard form contracts. It imposes a duty on the supplier to draw the attention of the customer to the exemption clauses or other contractual terms that oust common law protection. However, the CPA applies only to transactions between suppliers and consumers. The prohibition of unfair, unreasonable or unjust contract terms should apply to every contract. Parliament should intervene and enact legislation to prevent the abuse of freedom of contract by the strong party, to the detriment of other contracting party...|$|R
40|$|In 1801, at the {{beginning}} of his career as a political agent, Mountstuart Elphinstone and a friend were approached by an Indian fakir at the great Hindu shrine of the Juggernaut; the fakir asked “'When will you take this country?' We answered 'Never!' He said 'Yes; you will certainly take it. '" The incident illustrates the basic reluctance of the British to "take" India, a reluctance which in retrospect seems rather surprising. For the expansion of the highly organised power of the British at the expense of their weaker and less stable neighbours appears now as an almost inevitable process, which, having gathered momentum, continued irresistibly, impelled by its own dynamics. By 1818 the fakir's prophecy had come true; the British had conquered India “in spite of the most peremptory injunctions of forebearance from home”. Official policy, laid down in Pitt's 1784 India Act, abjured expansionist ambitions as "repugnant to the wish, the <b>honour</b> and <b>policy</b> of this nation. ” The Court of Directors of the East India Company, wishing to avoid the expenses of war and the responsibilities of rule, issued repeated instructions against the acquisition of territory, which it regarded as incompatible with its role as a trading company. The Company had, of course, originally established factories and settlements in India for commercial reasons yet the causes of its expansion into the subcontinent between 1796, when Elphinstone arrived in India, and 1818, when the last independent indigenous power was defeated, were not primarily economic. 'The most important motives were political and diplomatic and were related to general strategy and the defence of existing possessions. The Company had to decide whether it was to be a merchant or a ruler. Lord Wellesley, believing trade depended on security, opted for the latter. The problem of Britain's security in India was related both to the nation's role as a European and world power and to its position as an Indian power. The emphasis placed upon European rivalries in directing British expansion in Africa can also be applied to the Indian scene in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. In both cases the acquisition of areas, valuable for neither trade nor settlement, can be explained in terms of global strategy, international politics and the irrational fears by which they are sometimes governed...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The reasons why employers simultaneously demand different work groups with varying patterns of activity, conditions of service and earnings is inadequately understood. The demand for twilight workers and homeworkers is an under-researched area, while {{the appropriateness of the}} segmented labour market model is open to questioning. Therefore, a detailed comparison, from the viewpoint of demand, is made of the workforce groups discovered within an occupational local labour market. Data collected by employer interviews focus on worker characteristics, their different working conditions, and employer responses to change. Part A states the objectives and hypotheses, surveys the theoretical and legal contexts and reviews workgroup literature. The empirical programme is described, and brief accounts of preliminary empirical work undertaken in pre-pilot and pilot studies are reported. In Part B, organisational structures are outlined before an analysis of local labour market and workforce characteristics. An interplay is found between group characteristics and levels of supply, the latter being important to group formation and to employers' ability to exercise preference. Levels of knowledge are examined and options for mobility are assessed. The structure of the occupational local labour market is addressed by examining: firstly, the different forms of mobility; secondly, influences on the wage structure; and thirdly, the net advantages accruing to the various workgroups. Conclusions are drawn regarding the relevance of neo-classical and segmented labour market theories. It is found that segmentation exists, firstly between the male and female employees, and secondly within the female segment. This latter segmentation is brought under closer scrutiny to reveal homeworkers as an extreme example of secondary labour when pay and employment conditions are compared with those 6 f full-time and part-time day workers. Preference is examined from three different standpoints; a costing analysis is undertaken to determine the importance of cost-minimisation to labour demand, and employers' stated and implied preferences judged by their actions on key conditions of service are examined for differential treatment. Employer perceptions are reviewed, as are the effects of orientations to work on performance levels which further illuminates employer preferences. The power structure emanating· from supply, collective bargaining and legislation is assessed. Part C, draws together the conclusions and uses findings to identify factors influencing employer choice. It outlines demand criteria and shows that those for twilight workers and homeworkers are similar, although reasons for using the latter group are more numerous. Many adjustment instruments are shown to be available for adapting labour input to business fluctuations so obviating the need for wage adjustment. An adjustment sequence is calculated to illustrate its implications for workgroup employment and income levels and its universal applicability is considered. A labour market paradigm is suggested in which demands and supplies are conceptualized as having two components; initial intentions and effective outcomes. It illustrates seven conflict areas which can incorporate numerous theories of labour market operation. The appropriateness of much labour market theory is discussed, and it is concluded that twilight workers and homeworkers are utilised as a mechanism for <b>honouring</b> implicit contracts. <b>Policy</b> prescriptions and further research are considered...|$|R
