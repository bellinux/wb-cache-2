40|$|Esophageal and <b>gastric</b> <b>cancers</b> {{are both}} common and deadly. Patients present most often after disease {{progression}} and survival is therefore poor. Due to demographic variability and {{recent changes in}} disease incidence, much emphasis {{has been placed on}} studying risk factors for both esophageal and <b>gastric</b> <b>cancers.</b> However, with increasing understanding of these diseases, low survival rates persist and continued intensive studies are necessary to optimize treatment plans. This review article discusses updates in the evolving epidemiology, clinical presentation, risk factors, and diagnostic and treatment modalities of esophageal and <b>gastric</b> <b>cancers...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{prolonged}} administration of transforming growth factor (34 - 43) -alpha, an antagonist of TGF-alpha, on gastric carcinogenesis induced by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) {{and on the}} labelling and apoptotic indices and TGF-alpha immunoreactivity of gastric mucosa and <b>gastric</b> <b>cancers</b> was examined in Wistar rats. The rats received intraperitoneal injections of 10 or 20 microg kg(- 1) body weight of TGF(34 - 43) -alpha every other day after oral treatment with MNNG for 25 weeks. Long-term administration of TGF(34 - 43) -alpha at both doses significantly reduced the incidence of <b>gastric</b> <b>cancers</b> {{at the end of}} the experiment in week 52. However, TGF(34 - 43) -alpha had no significant effect on the number, histological type or depth of involvement of <b>gastric</b> <b>cancers.</b> Administration of TGF(34 - 43) -alpha also significantly decreased the bromodeoxyuridine labelling index and TGF-alpha immunoreactivity, and significantly increased the apoptotic index of antral mucosa and <b>gastric</b> <b>cancers.</b> These findings indicate that TGF(34 - 43) -alpha inhibits gastric carcinogenesis, and that its effects are mediated through decreased cell proliferation and TGF-alpha immunoreactivity and increased apoptosis induction in the <b>gastric</b> <b>cancers...</b>|$|R
40|$|The affects of L-thyroxine (T 4) on the {{incidence}} and histology of <b>gastric</b> <b>cancers</b> induced by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), {{and on the}} labelling index of gastric mucosal epithelial cells were investigated in Wistar rats. After oral treatment with MNNG for 25 weeks, the rats received s. c. injections of T 4 (0. 2 microgram kg- 1) in depot form every other day {{until the end of}} the experiment in Week 52. This long-term treatment with T 4 significantly increased {{the incidence}} of <b>gastric</b> <b>cancers</b> in Week 52. However, it did not influence the histological type of the <b>gastric</b> <b>cancers.</b> It also caused significant increases in the labelling indices of the fundic and antral epithelial cells. These findings indicate that T 4 enhances the development of <b>gastric</b> <b>cancers,</b> and that its effect may be related to its effect in increasing proliferation of gastric epithelial cells...|$|R
5|$|Colonization with H. pylori is not {{a disease}} in and of itself, but a {{condition}} associated {{with a number of}} disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Testing for H. pylori is recommended if peptic ulcer disease or low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma is present, after endoscopic resection of early <b>gastric</b> <b>cancer,</b> first-degree relatives with <b>gastric</b> <b>cancer,</b> and in certain cases of dyspepsia, not routinely. Several ways of testing exist. One can test noninvasively for H. pylori infection with a blood antibody test, stool antigen test, or with the carbon urea breath test (in which the patient drinks 14C—or 13C-labelled urea, which the bacterium metabolizes, producing labelled carbon dioxide that can be detected in the breath). Also, a urine ELISA test with a 96% sensitivity and 79% specificity is available. None of the test methods is completely failsafe. Even biopsy is dependent on the location of the biopsy. Blood antibody tests, for example, range from 76% to 84% sensitivity. Some drugs can affect H. pylori urease activity and give false negatives with the urea-based tests. The most accurate method for detecting H. pylori infection is with a histological examination from two sites after endoscopic biopsy, combined with either a rapid urease test or microbial culture.|$|E
5|$|The {{strain of}} H. pylori {{a person is}} exposed to may {{influence}} {{the risk of developing}} <b>gastric</b> <b>cancer.</b> Strains of H. pylori that produce high levels of two proteins, vacuolating toxin A (VacA) and the cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA), appear to cause greater tissue damage than those that produce lower levels or that lack those genes completely. These proteins are directly toxic to cells lining the stomach and signal strongly to the immune system that an invasion is under way. As a result of the bacterial presence, neutrophils and macrophages set up residence in the tissue to fight the bacteria assault.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} modern {{studies that have}} {{supported}} the original autopsy finding. In a 2008 study, researchers analysed samples of Napoleon's hair from throughout his life, as well as samples from his family and other contemporaries. All samples had high levels of arsenic, approximately 100 {{times higher than the}} current average. According to these researchers, Napoleon's body was already heavily contaminated with arsenic as a boy, and the high arsenic concentration in his hair was not caused by intentional poisoning; people were constantly exposed to arsenic from glues and dyes throughout their lives. Studies published in 2007 and 2008 dismissed evidence of arsenic poisoning, and confirmed evidence of peptic ulcer and <b>gastric</b> <b>cancer</b> as the cause of death.|$|E

50|$|In {{advanced}} <b>gastric</b> <b>cancers,</b> {{the prognosis}} {{for patients with}} the SRCCs was significantly worse than for the other histological types, which {{can be explained by}} the finding that advanced SRCC <b>gastric</b> <b>cancers</b> have a larger tumor size, more lymph node metastasis, a deeper invasive depth and more Borrmann type 4 lesions than other types.|$|R
5|$|Individuals {{infected}} with H. pylori have a 10 to 20% lifetime {{risk of developing}} peptic ulcers and a 1 to 2% risk of acquiring stomach cancer. Inflammation of the pyloric antrum {{is more likely to}} lead to duodenal ulcers, while inflammation of the corpus (body of the stomach) is more likely to lead to gastric ulcers and gastric carcinoma. However, H. pylori possibly plays a role only in the first stage that leads to common chronic inflammation, but not in further stages leading to carcinogenesis. A meta-analysis conducted in 2009 concluded the eradication of H. pylori reduces <b>gastric</b> <b>cancer</b> risk in previously infected individuals, suggesting the continued presence of H. pylori constitutes a relative risk factor of 65% for gastric cancers; in terms of absolute risk, the increase was from 1.1% to 1.7%.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{prolonged}} administration of all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) on sodium chloride-enhanced gastric carcinogenesis induced by N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, and the labelling and apoptotic indices and immunoreactivity of transforming growth factor (TGF) α in the <b>gastric</b> <b>cancers</b> {{was investigated in}} Wistar rats. After 25 weeks of carcinogen treatment, the rats were given chow pellets containing 10 % sodium chloride and subcutaneous injections of RA at doses of 0. 75 or 1. 5 mg kg− 1 body weight every other day. In week 52, oral supplementation with sodium chloride significantly increased the incidence of <b>gastric</b> <b>cancers</b> compared with the untreated controls. Long-term administration of RA at both doses significantly reduced the incidence of <b>gastric</b> <b>cancers,</b> which was enhanced by oral administration of sodium chloride. RA at both doses significantly decreased the labelling index and TGF-α immunoreactivity of <b>gastric</b> <b>cancers,</b> which were enhanced by administration of sodium chloride, and significantly increased the apoptotic index of cancers, which was lowered by administration of sodium chloride. These findings suggest that RA attenuates gastric carcinogenesis, enhanced by sodium chloride, by increasing apoptosis, decreasing DNA synthesis, and reducing TGF-α expression in <b>gastric</b> <b>cancers.</b> © 1999 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|R

After oral treatment with MNNG for 25 weeks, rats received s. c. injections of amiloride (0. 25 mg kg- 1 or 5. 0 mg kg- 1 body weight) in depot form every other day {{until the end of}} the experiment. Prolonged administration of 5. 0 mg kg- 1, but not 2. 5 mg kg- 1 of amiloride significantly decreased the incidence of <b>gastric</b> <b>cancers</b> in Week 52.

These findings indicate that amiloride inhibits the development of <b>gastric</b> <b>cancers,</b> and that its effect may be related to its effect in decreasing cell proliferation of the antral mucosa...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Aim In {{recent years}} {{several studies have}} shown {{increasing}} rate of upper <b>gastric</b> <b>cancers</b> regarding to decrease in distal <b>gastric</b> <b>cancers.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the trend of <b>gastric</b> <b>cancers</b> by location in Iran, which is one of the countries with high prevalence of <b>gastric</b> <b>cancers.</b> Methods All registered cases of gasterectomy in Tehran Cancer Institute from 1969 through 2004 were re-evaluated clinicopathologically. The stomach was anatomically divided into the upper, middle, and lower third. The prevalence of <b>gastric</b> <b>cancers</b> in 5 year periods estimated by location and the changes trough the time was evaluated independently and in aspect of age and sex. Results Over 36 years, the prevalence of cancers in the upper and middle third of the stomach have increased and that of the lower third has decreased. These changes were seen in both sexes and age groups under and over 50 and it was more significant in younger. Conclusion The results are the same as most previous reports in other countries. This can indicate different risk factors as well as confrontation with them. However in regard to few numbers of cases in this study, a population-based study is recommended for confirmation. </p...|$|R

25|$|Stomach cancer, {{also known}} as <b>gastric</b> <b>cancer,</b> is cancer {{developing}} from {{the lining of the}} stomach. Early symptoms may include heartburn, upper abdominal pain, nausea and loss of appetite. Later signs and symptoms may include weight loss, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, and blood in the stool among others. The cancer may spread from the stomach {{to other parts of the}} body, particularly the liver, lungs, bones, lining of the abdomen and lymph nodes.|$|E
25|$|Gastric ulcers {{are most}} often {{localized}} on the lesser curvature of the stomach. The ulcer is a round to oval parietal defect ("hole"), 2 to 4cm diameter, with a smooth base and perpendicular borders. These borders are not elevated or irregular in the acute form of peptic ulcer, regular but with elevated borders and inflammatory surrounding in the chronic form. In the ulcerative form of <b>gastric</b> <b>cancer</b> the borders are irregular. Surrounding mucosa may present radial folds, {{as a consequence of}} the parietal scarring.|$|E
25|$|Upper {{gastrointestinal}} bleeding is {{gastrointestinal bleeding}} {{in the upper}} gastrointestinal tract, commonly defined as bleeding arising from the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum.

As a result, upper gastrointestinal bleeding is considered a medical emergency and typically requires hospital care for urgent diagnosis and treatment. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding can be caused by peptic ulcers, gastric erosions, esophageal varices, and some rarer causes such as <b>gastric</b> <b>cancer.</b>|$|E

40|$|Summary The {{effects of}} ethanol (EtOH) on the {{incidence}} and histology of <b>gastric</b> <b>cancers</b> induced by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) were investigated in Wistar rats. The animals received alternateday i. p. injections of 2. 5 mlkg- 1 body weight of 20 % EtOH in 0. 9 % NaCl solution after 20 weeks of oral treatment with MNNG.

However, it had no influence on the caused {{a significant increase in}} the labelling index of histological types of the <b>gastric</b> <b>cancers.</b> Furthermore, it the epithelial cells of the antrum in week 52. These findings indicate that EtOH promotes gastric carcinogenesis, and that this effect may be related to its effect in increasing proliferation of the antral epithelial cells. There is epidemiological evidence of an association between excessive alcohol drinking and cancers of the mouth, larynx, oesophagus and liver (World Health Organization, 1964). However, only a weak association between alcohol and <b>gastric</b> <b>cancers</b> has been found (Williams and Horm, 1977) ...|$|R

25|$|People {{were not}} only {{consuming}} these perishables because it became easier for they themselves to store them, but because the innovations in refrigerated transportation and storage led to less spoilage and waste, thereby driving the prices of these products down. Refrigeration accounts for at least 5.1% {{of the increase in}} adult stature (in the US) through improved nutrition, and when the indirect effects associated with improvements in the quality of nutrients and the reduction in illness is additionally factored in, the overall impact becomes considerably larger. Recent studies have also shown a negative relationship between the number of refrigerators in a household and the rate of <b>gastric</b> <b>cancer</b> mortality.|$|E
25|$|Helicobacter pylori {{infection}} (a {{common occurrence}} {{thought to have}} affected {{over half of the}} world's population) is not a risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma and actually appears to be protective. Despite being a cause of GERD and a risk factor for <b>gastric</b> <b>cancer,</b> the infection seems to be associated with a reduced risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma of as much as 50%. The biological explanation for a protective effect is somewhat unclear. One explanation is that some strains of H. pylori reduce stomach acid, thereby reducing damage by GERD. Decreasing rates of H. pylori infection in Western populations over recent decades, which have been linked to better hygiene and increased refrigeration of food, could be a factor in the concurrent increase in esophageal adenocarcinoma.|$|E

40|$|AbstractGastric {{cancer is}} a common disease with limited {{treatment}} options and a poor prognosis. Many <b>gastric</b> <b>cancers</b> harbour potentially actionable targets, including over-expression and mutations in tyrosine kinase pathways. Agents have been developed against these targets with varying success- in particular, the use of trastuzumab in HER 2 -overexpressing <b>gastric</b> <b>cancers</b> has resulted in overall survival benefits. <b>Gastric</b> <b>cancers</b> also {{have high levels of}} somatic mutations, making them candidates for immunotherapy; early work in this field has been promising. Recent advances in whole genome and multi-platform sequencing have driven the development of molecular classification systems, which may in turn guide the selection of patients for targeted treatment. Moving forward, challenges will include the development of appropriate biomarkers to predict responses to targeted therapy, and the application of new molecular classifications into trial development and clinical practice...|$|R
