40|$|Based on the 1994 curriculum, {{there are}} three <b>package</b> <b>programs</b> for senior high school {{students}} in Indonesia, namely: language <b>package</b> <b>program,</b> mathematical and natural science <b>package</b> <b>program,</b> and social studies <b>package</b> <b>program.</b> This thesis deals with the second <b>package</b> <b>program,</b> mathematical and natural science, especially with its English subject. Through observation and interviews, it is known that there is no English teaching materials for the mathematical and natural science <b>package</b> <b>program</b> that really meets the students' needs. Even if there is, the materials are more suitable for the social studies <b>package</b> <b>program,</b> especially the reading passages. Knowing how important reading materials for English teaching and learning activities, the principal aim of the English teaching in Indonesia is to make students able to read books in English. The writer would like to suggest reading materials that are considered more suitable for the mathematical and natural science <b>package</b> <b>program.</b> The suggested reading materials include the reading passages and reading exercises. Books and articles related to the present study have been the first aid used by the writer in conducting this study. After gathering, summarizing and expressing the relevant facts and opinions from these sources, she suggests her own opinion concerning materials to develop the reading skill of SMU IPA. Then the writer collects materials and designs the exercises related to the passages...|$|R
