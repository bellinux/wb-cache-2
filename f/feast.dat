50|$|There {{were two}} main types of <b>feasts,</b> as {{discussed}} by Lisa J. LeCount and suggested by Dietler, diacritical exclusionary events and inclusionary events. Diacritical <b>feasts</b> were {{hosted by the}} wealthy and powerful, with only a strict list of other elite guests. These <b>feasts</b> were to demonstrate differences in social status and ensure that other members of society knew who had the power. This is evident with royals, politicians and the elite gaining loyalty through hosting <b>feasts</b> or performing rituals. Inclusionary <b>feasts</b> were held to promote solidarity and equality among the entire community. The invitation list for these <b>feasts</b> was broader and the event was larger and in a public setting. Inclusionary <b>feasts</b> were celebrations by {{the community as a}} whole. The cuisine for inclusionary <b>feasts</b> was similar to that of daily meals, whereas for diacritical <b>feasts</b> the cuisine was higher end and meant to impress the guests. <b>Feasts</b> differed slightly throughout eras and various societies in Mesoamerica.|$|R
50|$|<b>Feasting</b> {{occurred}} {{on a wide}} variety of social scales and contexts in Aztec society. They were held as celebrations of births, deaths, marriages or other events. The <b>feasts</b> included activities such as gift exchanges, human sacrifices, incense burning, speeches, plays, and of course eating and drinking. Royal and noble houses entertained and hosted <b>feasts</b> at scheduled times such as to distribute foods and money to the kingdom’s staff and administrative workers. Both kingdoms and common households held <b>feasts</b> to celebrate religious events and life events of their family (Smith 2003). Aztec Codices show depictions of public-religious <b>feasts,</b> elite <b>feasts</b> hosted by the ruler, and home celebrations. Most <b>feasts</b> included some type of ritual activity, but there were some <b>feasts</b> that were more religious and ritual than others. At these ritual <b>feasts</b> the foods are not just offered to the gods, but are consumed at a particular time throughout the ceremony. When worshiping death gods, such as Mictlantecuhtli, human flesh is consumed around the temple of the ritual.|$|R
