5|$|Around 1636 the Sejm (Polish parliament) {{opposed the}} {{marriage}} of King Władysław IV Waza to Wiśniowiecki's sister, Anna. Following this, Jeremi distanced <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> royal court, although he periodically returned to Warsaw, usually {{as one of the}} deputies to the Sejm from the Ruthenian Voivodeship. Soon afterward, Jeremi himself married Gryzelda Zamoyska, daughter of Chancellor Tomasz Zamoyski, on 27 February 1639, on Gryzelda's 16th birthday.|$|E
5|$|As a {{composer}} and pianist, Sorabji was largely self-taught, and he distanced <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> main currents of contemporary musical life {{early in his}} career. He developed a highly idiosyncratic musical language, with roots in composers as diverse as Busoni, Debussy and Szymanowski, and he dismissed large portions of the established and contemporary repertoire.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, Charles tried to release <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> oath he swore {{to protect the}} Muslims. He wrote to Pope Clement VII in 1523 and again in 1524 for this dispensation. Clement {{initially}} resisted the request, but issued in May 1524 a papal brief releasing Charles from the oath and absolving him from all perjuries that might arise from breaking it. The Pope also authorized the Inquisition to suppress oppositions to the upcoming conversions.|$|E
5|$|Community Trolls, who {{may have}} at times {{included}} additional band members, performed in public at least twice. By sometime in 1984, however, Sweet began distancing <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Athens music scene, and in 1985 he got a record deal and moved to New York. While some people accused him of using his Athens music connections to get ahead and then desert the scene, R.E.M. did not hold any hard feelings towards him.|$|E
5|$|From the start, Habré {{isolated}} <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{other members}} of the GUNT, which he treated with disdain. Habré's hostility for Libya's influence in Chad united itself with his ambition and ruthlessness: observers concluded that the warlord would never be content with anything short of the highest office. It was thought that sooner or later an armed confrontation between Habré and the pro-Libyan factions would take place, and more importantly, between Habré and Goukouni.|$|E

5|$|His {{performance}} at the Olympic trials was in vain as Mr. Justice Mackay upheld the BOA ban in the High Court of Justice and stated that a right to work was not sufficient reason to remove it. The BOA chairman, Lord Moynihan, was satisfied with the outcome, stating that those abusing drugs did not deserve to represent Great Britain at the Olympics. However, he lamented that a sprinter of Chambers' calibre had in effect excluded <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> competition.|$|E
5|$|In {{the earlier}} {{part of his}} life, Yeats {{was a member of}} the Irish Republican Brotherhood. Due to the {{escalating}} tension of the political scene, Yeats distanced <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> core political activism in the midst of the Easter Rising, even holding back his poetry inspired by the events until 1920.|$|E
5|$|The {{identity}} {{of the old man}} remains unclear, though context implies that he may be Pattern Recognition's protagonist Cayce Pollard's father, having removed <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> channels of normal life to focus on disrupting what he sees as criminal elements operating in the United States Government.|$|E

5000|$|In August 2013 the Court of Appeal {{held that}} Smith should have recused <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> hearing an {{application}} for wasted costs against a firm of solicitors. Smith had made strong criticisms {{of the quality of}} the evidence of an expert witness called to give evidence of Ethiopian law, and had attributed the cause of the expert's failings to solicitors who, according to Smith, had failed to prepare the expert appropriately for the trial. Smith declined to recuse <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> hearing <b>the</b> subsequent wasted costs application against the solicitors, but an appeal against this decision was allowed by the Court of Appeal. Lady Justice Arden observed in her judgment (at paragraph 59) that there was [...] "apparent bias stemming <b>from</b> <b>the</b> facts of the case which meant that the judge should have recused <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> hearing <b>the</b> wasted costs application" [...] and (at paragraph 62) that [...] "the judge should certainly have recused <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> hearing <b>the</b> wasted costs application".|$|R
5|$|The robbery {{also made}} the Bolshevik Centre unpopular more widely among European social democrat groups. Lenin's desire to {{distance}} <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> legacy of the robbery {{may have been one}} of the sources of the rift between him and Bogdanov and Krasin. Stalin distanced himself from Kamo's gang and never publicized his role in the robbery.|$|E
5|$|When Naguib began {{showing signs}} of {{independence}} from Nasser by distancing <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> RCC's land reform decrees and drawing closer to Egypt's established political forces, namely the Wafd and the Brotherhood, Nasser resolved to depose him. In June, Nasser {{took control of the}} interior ministry post from Naguib loyalist Sulayman Hafez, and pressured Naguib to conclude the abolition of the monarchy.|$|E
5|$|With {{the failure}} of his attempt to conquer Naxos, Aristagoras found himself in dire straits; {{he was unable to}} repay Artaphernes, and had, moreover, alienated <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Persian royal family.

In a desperate attempt to save himself, Aristagoras chose to incite his own subjects, the Milesians, to revolt against their Persian masters, thereby beginning the Ionian Revolt.|$|E

5|$|Yeats was an Irish Nationalist, {{who sought}} {{a kind of}} {{traditional}} lifestyle articulated through poems such as 'The Fisherman'.

5|$|According to flashbacks {{during the}} game, Squall {{grew up in}} an orphanage with the other playable {{characters}} (except Rinoa). The orphans were cared for by Edea; although Squall remembers little about his past, he becomes an emotionally detached, cynical and introverted boy whose original goal is to go through life without any emotional ties or dependence. He gradually warms, and it is later revealed that his detachment from his companions is a defensive mechanism to protect <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> emotional pain he suffered when he and his older sister were separated.|$|E
5|$|After the film's mainly {{negative}} reviews Akshay Kumar {{lashed out}} at critics, accusing them of lacking {{an understanding of the}} audience and the basic ideas of filmmaking. There were rumours about a feud between Kumar and Ekta Kapoor about the former's distancing <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> project and not promoting it enough. The three leads attended the inaugural 2013 Indian Premier League match between Kolkata Knight Riders and Delhi Daredevils to promote the film, but the match organisers asked their cameramen not to focus on the actors. After this, a disappointed Kumar asked Kapoor to re-arrange the film's marketing schedule.|$|E

Ken reverses his ultimatum after a conversation with a dismayed Finn and cancels the extra practice, allowing the football players to again do both activities.

Will decides to remove <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> equation and later tells Emma and Ken that he {{will not be able to}} create their mash-up.|$|E
5|$|An {{incident}} {{during a}} game against Leicester City in the league saw Shearer charged with misconduct by the FA, with media sources claiming that video footage showed him intentionally kicking Neil Lennon in the head following a challenge. The referee of the game took no action against Shearer, and he was then cleared of all charges by the FA, with Lennon giving evidence in the player's defence. Former Football Association chief Graham Kelly, who brought the charges against the player, later claimed in his autobiography that Shearer had threatened to withdraw <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1998 World Cup squad if the charges were upheld; a claim strenuously denied by Shearer.|$|E
5|$|As {{the case}} {{expanded}} beyond his jurisdiction, Curto recused <b>himself</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> trial {{and was replaced}} by Javier Beltramone, who released García from prison. Litoral Gas demanded Beltramone's recusal for expressing an opinion about the case to the press. The appeal court agreed in a 2–1 vote to remove Beltramone, and the case was transferred to Patricia Bilotta. García had claimed that he was following instructions received {{in the days before the}} explosion, so Bilotta summoned the technical officers of Litoral Gas to clarify that point. Litoral Gas said that García had not received any instructions prior to the explosion.|$|E
