500|$|Dürer's father wears a dark shirt, russet {{coat and}} a black <b>hat</b> <b>lined</b> with fur. His skin is slack at the mouth and chin, and he has small, {{intelligent}} eyes, which Von Fircks describes as [...] "dark and serious". Their curves echo those of the heavy lids beneath. His eyes are lined with crow's feet and shadowed with brown hatched paint. His facial features are built from brush strokes more typical of drawing than painting—at this young age Dürer was a far more skilled draughtsman than painter. Technical analysis carried out in 2013 by Dagmar Hirschfelder revealed a detailed background which was over-painted by the artist. The abandoned interior space consisted of a corner of a room with an arched window looking out to a countryside view. This type of interior {{can be traced to}} the Netherlandish tradition, and is rare in German portraiture of the period.|$|R

5000|$|The Order of St. Patrick was {{established}} in 1783 as the senior order of chivalry in the Kingdom of Ireland. The colour of its honours needed to {{differ from those of}} the Order of the Garter (dark blue) and the Order of the Thistle (green). Orange was considered, but the association with orangeism felt to be too sectarian, so the lighter blue of the arms of Ireland was chosen. [...] Knights and officers of the order wore a [...] "sky blue" [...] mantle and riband, a <b>hat</b> <b>lined</b> with [...] "blue", and a badge ringed with [...] "blue" [...] enamel.
