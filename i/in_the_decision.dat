Clinical observations, including a total lack of responsiveness, a known diagnosis, and neural imaging evidence, may all play a role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> to pronounce brain death.|$|E

5|$|After briefly {{stopping}} in Albany, where its convoy was delayed due to {{concerns over the}} presence of German warships en route, the 10th Battalion departed Australian waters in November and proceeded towards Egypt. Initially, the plan had been for the battalion to continue on the United Kingdom from where it would subsequently move to the Western Front. Poor conditions and overcrowding in training camps in the United Kingdom resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> to disembark the Australians in Alexandria instead. Arriving there on 4 December 1914, the battalion was sent into camp at Mena, near Cairo.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{insufficient}} clearance {{between the}} locomotives and the 25kV overhead electric wires south of Crewe, {{the whole class}} was banned from operating under them with effect from 1 September 1964. To highlight this prohibition a yellow diagonal stripe was painted on the cab sides.

5|$|Declassified wartime {{documents}} show that Simonds, {{along with several}} others in the Allied high command, had likely been notified on July 23 of a massive German buildup on the ridge.

5|$|During the Great Depression, the Works Progress Administration {{chose to}} make Clark State Forest a {{training}} {{center for the}} Civilian Conservation Corps, and also made it Indiana's largest CCC cantonment in November1933.

The state forest's proximity to the Jeffersonville Quartermaster Depot was key <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> to focus so much attention on it.|$|E

5|$|Implicit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> {{to develop}} atomic bombs {{was the need}} to test them. Lacking open, thinly-populated areas, British {{officials}} considered locations overseas.

An official statement from DePaul strongly defended the decision to deny Finkelstein tenure, stated that outside influence played no role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision.</b> In 2008, he was banned from entering Israel for 10 years.|$|E
