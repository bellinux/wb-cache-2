5|$|Critics {{have offered}} many {{explanations}} for the characters' longevity, suggesting variously that the Hardy Boys embody simple wish <b>fulfillment,</b> American ideals of boyhood and masculinity, a well-respected father paradoxically argued to be inept, {{and the possibility of}} the triumph of good over evil.|$|E

5|$|Mormons {{believe that}} the Star of Bethlehem was an actual astronomical event visible the world over. In the Book of Mormon, which they believe {{contains}} writings of ancient prophets, Samuel the Lamanite prophesies that a new star will appear {{as a sign that}} Jesus has been born, and Nephi later writes about the <b>fulfillment</b> of this prophecy.|$|E

5|$|The album Adios {{was written}} and {{performed}} almost exclusively by Konietzko and Skold. Ogre again provided vocals, as did German musician Nina Hagen. Originally the <b>fulfillment</b> of the band's ten record contract with Wax Trax!/TVT, Adios later signaled {{the breakup of}} the band itself, which Esch's and Schulz's limited participation foreshadowed.|$|E
5|$|A {{cultural}} icon, Nancy Drew {{is cited}} as a formative influence {{by a number of}} women, from Supreme Court Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Sonia Sotomayor to former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and former First Lady Laura Bush. Feminist literary critics have analyzed the character's enduring appeal, arguing variously that Nancy Drew is a mythic hero, an expression of wish <b>fulfillment,</b> or an embodiment of contradictory ideas about femininity.|$|E
5|$|Besides meditation, Luang Pu Sodh {{promoted}} {{the study of}} Buddhism as well. In this combination {{he was one of}} the pioneers in Thai Buddhism. In 1939, Luang Pu Sodh set up a Pali Institute at Wat Paknam, which is said to have cost 2.5 million baht. Luang Pu Sodh financed the building through the production of amulets, which is common in Thai Buddhism. The kitchen which he built was the <b>fulfillment</b> of an intention which he had since his first years at Wat Pho, when he experienced difficulty in finding food. It also resulted in monks having more time to study the Dhamma.|$|E

5|$|His mysticism is {{informed}} by the influences of Böhme and Franckenberg {{as well as of}} prominent writers Meister Eckhart (1260–1327), Johannes Tauler (–1361), Heinrich Suso (–1366), and Jan van Ruysbroeck (1293/4–1381). Critic and literary theorist Georg Ellinger surmised in his study of Silesius that his poetry was influenced by loneliness (especially due to the death of his parents and becoming an orphan early in life), ungoverned impulsivity, and lack of personal <b>fulfillment,</b> rendering much of his poetry confessional and exhibiting internal psychological conflict.|$|E
5|$|In February 2007, the Liberal {{opposition}} {{brought forward}} a non-binding motion for Canada to renew {{its commitment to}} the Kyoto Protocol. All Conservative MPs who {{were present in the}} House, including Baird, voted against the motion, which passed {{with the support of the}} three opposition parties. The following month, opposition members on a special Commons committee used their majority to bring forward sweeping changes to the government's Clean Air Act. Among other things, the revised act called for participation in international carbon markets and the <b>fulfillment</b> of Kyoto targets.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all of the}} hospital's doctors, House is {{required}} to treat patients in the facility's walk-in clinic. His grudging <b>fulfillment</b> of this duty, or his creative methods of avoiding it, constitute a recurring subplot, which often serves as the series' comic relief. During clinic duty, House confounds patients with unwelcome observations into their personal lives, eccentric prescriptions, and unorthodox treatments. However, after seeming to be inattentive to their complaints, he regularly impresses them with rapid and accurate diagnoses. Analogies {{with some of the}} simple cases in the clinic occasionally inspire insights that help solve the team's case.|$|E
5000|$|A fill or kill (FOK) {{order is}} [...] "an {{order to buy}} or sell a stock that must be {{executed}} immediately"—a few seconds, customarily—in its entirety; otherwise, the entire order is cancelled; no partial <b>fulfillments</b> are allowed.|$|R
50|$|Many {{scholarly}} and popular interpreters {{have argued that}} a prophecy may have a dual fulfillment; others have argued {{for the possibility of}} multiple <b>fulfillments.</b> In some senses this has been occasionally referred to as an apotelesmatic interpretation of specific prophecies.|$|R
50|$|Other {{religious}} {{groups that have}} been seen as <b>fulfillments</b> of the prophecy include the Ratana church, founded by Tahupotiki Wiremu Ratana; the Ringatu church, founded by Te Kooti; and the Church of the Seven Rules of Jehovah, founded by Simon Patete.|$|R
5|$|Matthew and Luke each {{describe}} Jesus' nativity (or birth), {{especially that}} Jesus was born by a virgin Mary in Bethlehem in <b>fulfillment</b> of prophecy. Luke's account emphasizes events {{before the birth}} of Jesus and centers on Mary, while Matthew's mostly covers those after the birth and centers on Joseph. Both accounts state that Jesus was born to Joseph and Mary, his betrothed, in Bethlehem, and both support {{the doctrine of the}} virgin birth of Jesus, according to which Jesus was miraculously conceived by the Holy Spirit in Mary's womb when she was still a virgin.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{after the}} victory the festival of the Agroteras Thysia ("{{sacrifice}} to the Agrotéra") {{was held at}} Agrae near Athens, in honor of Artemis Agrotera ("Artemis the Huntress"). This was in <b>fulfillment</b> of a vow made by the city before the battle, to offer in sacrifice a number of goats {{equal to that of}} the Persians slain in the conflict. The number was so great, it was decided to offer 500 goats yearly until the number was filled. Xenophon notes that at his time, 90 years after the battle, goats were still offered yearly.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman–Russian {{occupation}} prolonged itself until 1851, {{while the}} 1849 Convention of Balta Liman awarded the Wallachian crown to Barbu Dimitrie Știrbei. In {{contrast to the}} 18481849 setbacks, the period inaugurated by the Crimean War disestablished both Russian domination and the Regulamentul Organic regime, and, within the space of one generation, brought about the <b>fulfillment</b> of virtually all revolutionary projects. The common actions of Moldavians and Wallachians, in pace {{with the presence of}} Wallachian activists in Transylvania, helped circulate the ideal of national unity, with the ultimate goal of reuniting all majority-Romanian territories within one state.|$|E
25|$|Judaism {{has never}} {{accepted}} {{any of the}} claimed <b>fulfillments</b> of prophecy that Christianity attributes to Jesus. Judaism also forbids the worship of a person {{as a form of}} idolatry, since the central belief of Judaism is the absolute unity and singularity of God.|$|R

5|$|The Overlords {{are eager}} to escape from their own {{evolutionary}} dead end by studying the Overmind, so Rodricks's information is potentially of great value to them. By radio, Rodricks describes a vast burning column ascending from the planet. As the column disappears, Rodricks experiences {{a profound sense of}} emptiness when the children have gone. Then material objects and the Earth itself begin to dissolve into transparency. Jan reports no fear, but a powerful sense of <b>fulfillment.</b> The Earth evaporates in a flash of light. Karellen looks back at the receding Solar System and gives a final salute to the human species.|$|E
5|$|Virginia {{converted}} to Catholicism in <b>fulfillment</b> of a promise {{which she had}} made to herself while observing Patrick Breen pray in his cabin. The Murphy survivors lived in Marysville. The Breens {{made their way to}} San Juan Bautista where they operated an inn and became the anonymous subjects of J. Ross Browne's story about his severe discomfort upon learning that he was staying with alleged cannibals, printed in Harper's Magazine in 1862. Many of the survivors encountered similar reactions.|$|E
5|$|A prophecy {{states that}} a female {{child with a}} special {{birthmark}} will herald {{the downfall of the}} evil sorceress Queen Bavmorda. Bavmorda imprisons all pregnant women in her realm to prevent <b>fulfillment</b> of the prophecy. When the prophesied child Elora Danan is born, the mother begs the midwife to hide the infant and smuggle her to safety. The midwife reluctantly accepts and leaves Nockmaar castle unnoticed. The mother is executed, the midwife is hunted down and eventually found. Knowing she cannot escape, she sets the baby on a makeshift raft of grass and sends her down the river hoping for fate to run its course. The midwife is killed by Nockmaar hounds. Bavmorda, furious about the escape, summons her daughter Sorsha and her army's commander, General Kael, to find the baby.|$|E

The DIagnostic and DEcision-theoretic framework for DEontic reasoning DIO(DE) 2 formalizes reasoning about viola-tions and <b>fulfillments,</b> and is used to characterize the distinction between normative diagnosis theory and (qualitative) decision theory.

5|$|Although Muhammad had {{delivered}} Quranic verses commanding the Hajj, the Muslims had not performed it due to Quraysh enmity. In {{the month of}} Shawwal 628, Muhammad ordered his followers to obtain sacrificial animals and {{to prepare for a}} pilgrimage (umrah) to Mecca, saying that God had promised him the <b>fulfillment</b> of this goal in a vision when he was shaving his head after completion of the Hajj. Upon hearing of the approaching 1,400 Muslims, the Quraysh dispatched 200 cavalry to halt them. Muhammad evaded them by taking a more difficult route, enabling his followers to reach al-Hudaybiyya just outside Mecca. According to Watt, although Muhammad's decision to make the pilgrimage was based on his dream, he was also demonstrating to the pagan Meccans that Islam did not threaten the prestige of the sanctuaries, that Islam was an Arabian religion.|$|E

Noting that she had recently become secretary of her parent-teacher association, she said that she was beginning to feel more confident in herself. A member of the Legion of Mary, Garza took her Catholic faith seriously. In her letter, she indicated that was finding comfort in attending Mass and Communion every day.|$|E
5|$|By 1961, workers' basic wages {{had risen}} {{to an average of}} about 73 percent of their total {{earnings}}; piece-rate workers saw an average of 71 percent and time workers 76 percent of their earnings as their basic wage.

The proportion of workers who achieved 100 percent or less of their quota varied from as low as 5.1 percent in iron and steel industries, to 31.4 percent in coal mining. Across Soviet industry, the average level of quota <b>fulfillment</b> fell from 169 percent before the reform, to 120 percent in October 1963.|$|E
