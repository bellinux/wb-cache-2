The existing traditional means of communication and information sharing among the BDF units and bases do not meet the present requirements and may negatively impact productivity and mission readiness in the BDF. The thesis begins with a background discussion of the communication problems in the BDF and examines the problem in the context of designing and implementing an <b>Enterprise</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Portal</b> (EIP). This would facilitate the collaboration and the flow of information within and among units throughout different regions in Botswana. The approach to the problem involves defining an EIP, evaluating the benefits of an EIP and assessing technologies critical to implementing an EIP. After defining an EIP, a business plan is presented to provide a guideline for implementing the Botswana Defence Force <b>Enterprise</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Portal</b> (BDF-EIP). The thesis further discusses organizational challenges that may affect implementing the BDF-EIP. These organizational issues include a discussion on change, change management and champion.

However, e-Government {{is not a simple}} on-line information provision. It requires a flexible and comprehensive architecture that supports development of complete requirements when planning, designing, and building major systems. This is essential to avoid unnecessary duplication of infrastructure and major components, to have no risk of incompatibility, and to integrate disparate processes, services and activities located outside enterprises or administrations. In this context, the present contribution aims at studying some e-government architectures and solutions.

40|$|Libraries have {{traditionally}} {{played a key}} role in enterprises by facilitating access to relevant internal and external information sources. They have absorbed several enabling information technologies over the past several decades, in an attempt to improve the quality and timeliness of their information services. Digital information processing was however limited to bibliographic and catalogue data. Advent of the Internet significantly intensified the pace of change since the mid 1990 's. Rapid maturing of Internet and intranet technologies have witnessed all round developments in publishing, communication, delivery and access to a multitude of digital information, both in commercial and academic domains. Web technology has emerged to be the converging point for all related processes, media, tools and techniques. This has in turn given impetus for the development of digital libraries and knowledge management solutions. Changes these developments have brought about pose interesting challenges for effective management of digital <b>information</b> in <b>enterprises.</b> What <b>information</b> infrastructures are required in enterprises that can take advantage of these developments? We argue that libraries, given their traditional strength in organising information and the lead they have exhibited in managing access to web-based information, are well placed to play a significant role in managing both internal and external digital information resources. This requires that the libraries enhance library websites to full-fledged intranet <b>information</b> <b>portals</b> (or <b>enterprise</b> <b>information</b> <b>portals),</b> by incorporating knowledge organisation principles of traditional libraries, standards, tools and techniques of DLs; and exploit internal information assets, knowledge resources and promote learning and collaboration using appropriate KM solutions.

In parallel the source of these information can be provided within or outside of the enterprise. By now, most approaches concentrate on {{the integration of the}} user interface. But the diversity of the information type and sources requires integration beyond this level. Therefore new architectures for information systems to support management decision are needed. Starting form the analysis of the state-of-the-art a new metadata based concept for system integration is presented and developed in three steps. A short description of an imaginary EIP shows the intended opportunities the systems will provide. Metadata management is used to integrate operational systems to a single source of information and consolidates metadata of data warehouse systems and content management systems within a new metadata integration model. Using the resulting integrated source of information, new information system architectures are developed to build <b>Enterprise</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Portals</b> for data warehouse systems and content management systems...|$|R
40|$|An <b>enterprise</b> <b>information</b> <b>portal</b> (EIP) {{is viewed}} as a {{knowledge}} community. Activity theory provides a framework to study such a community: members of an EIP conduct specific tasks that are assigned through a division of labor. Each member of an <b>enterprise</b> <b>information</b> <b>portal</b> can undergo three distinct types of learning processes: learning-by-investment, learning-by-doing, and learning-from-others. Through these three types of learning processes, each member achieves specialized knowledge that is related to his or her own task. Cumulative knowledge resulting from the learning processes is considered in terms of two distinct attributes: depth and breadth of knowledge. This paper formulates a mathematical model and defines the goal of an EIP member as maximizing the net benefits of knowledge resulting from individual investment and effort. Numerical examples are provided to analyze patterns of optimal investment and effort plans as well as the resulting accumulated knowledge. The results provide useful managerial implications. In business conditions characterized by high interest rates or high internal rate of returns, it is preferable for members to delay spending their resources for learning. Intensive investment and efforts to obtain knowledge are preferable when the discount rate of costs is high, when knowledge is durable, when the value of knowledge is high, when the initial level of knowledge is high, when the productivity of the learning process is high, and when sufficient knowledge is transferred from other members. On the other hand, the size of the EIP has a positive or negative effect depending on the attribute of knowledge and the productivity of teaming processes. Further properties of the optimal decisions and learning processes are analyzed and discussed...|$|E

40|$|Addressing the {{diversity}} in information requirements across the enterprise {{is a central}} challenge in enterprise content management. <b>Enterprise</b> <b>information</b> <b>portals</b> (EIPs) hold promise in this regard, offering each user a gateway to customized and personalized content. However, in large organizations EIP implementers face the complexity of tailoring portals for potentially thousands of users. A conceptual framework based on marketing fundamentals is developed to inform EIP implementation in this respect. It is argued that EIP implementers should view their user community {{as a number of}} distinct segments in order to address divergent needs more specifically (as opposed to a ‘one size fits all’ approach). For each identified segment, a ‘mix’ of content (product), distribution (place), promotion and price (cost) should be considered. The framework is applied to two cases of EIP implementation in large organizations. It is proposed that segmentation enables better planning of the overall EIP implementation effort. Considerations such as the number of user segments, customization, and personalization of content, and the funding of EIP development in large organizations are also discussed. The concepts elaborated here also hold theoretical relevance for other IS implementation contexts that involve very large usercommunities with diverse information<br /...|$|R

Not {{only that it}} costs the company to develop it, it requires significant business process change in order to leverage it for business benefits. It is also required to support business strategy.

Every parent must now feel the obligation to ensure that their child has access to the Internet as part of their overall education. Similarly, no advertising campaign is now complete without reference to a Web site {{and if you want to}} know something about an unknown organisation (whether company, University or law firm), the first thing you do is look up their Web site. Over the past few years, most Internet users have ceased worrying about what the Internet is and how it works and have begun to treat it more like the telephone – a convenient appliance for certain tasks. But at the same time, the Internet is becoming an increasingly complex place.

40|$|<b>Enterprise</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Portals</b> (EIPs) {{have become}} crucial {{components}} in contemporary organisations, including universities. Campus portals (CPs) {{have found their}} way into the academic environment and universities are increasingly implementing these technologies. While there are many studies concerning EIPs in organisations, there are few studies that touch this issue in the academic environment. This study investigates factors affecting the adoption, implementation and utilisation of CPs from the implementers’ and users’ perspectives. It adopts a comparative approach based on multiple case studies in some Saudi and UK universities. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews and documentation, which was analysed using hermeneutics and other qualitative data analysis techniques. Findings show that adoption and implementation of CPs are affected by factors including: technological, organisational, environmental, financial, innovation and user-related factors. Results from the users perspective reveal that although CPs are perceived to be useful in terms of accessing information and services, there are many concerns related to system, content and service quality. Moreover, the study has identified two main gaps between users and the implementers: a communication gap and an expectations gap. Consequently, users complained about a lack of user involvement and poor communication. Findings are interpreted using elements from institutional theory. Development of CPs is affected by many institutional factors such as coercive, mimetic, normative and competitive pressures. Furthermore, the introduction of CPs could lead to a clash of institutional logics among various stakeholders. Institutional arguments are likely to arise between portal teams and other campus constituents such as service providers and users. This study has three major contributions. First, it used institutional theory to investigate CPs adoption and implementation. As a result, it extends the line of research on the use of this theory to study IS in organisations. Second, it responds to calls from other IS researchers to study portals by conducting in-depth field investigation using qualitative research. Third, it addresses issues related to the development of bilingual portals in universities. Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabi...|$|R
40|$|Model {{management}} is a generic approach to solving problems of data programmability where precisely engineered mappings are required.

Much has been learned about model management since it was proposed seven years ago. This leads us to a revised vision that differs from the original in two main respects: the operations must handle more expressive mappings, and the runtime that executes mappings should be added as an important model management component.

40|$|It is {{fortunate}} that the <b>Enterprise</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Portal</b> (EIP) concept {{was introduced by}} two analysts with a concern for definition. Else, given the sudden popularity of EIPs, {{there would be no}} restraint on the tendency of vendors to try to exploit the label by attaching it to their products. Even so, since the area {{is in a state of}} very rapid growth and differentiation, vendors and analysts with an interest in it are adding their own orientations and nuances to the EIP idea every day. Some do this by addressing the term EIP directly, others by defining related terms such as business portal or corporate portal. Inevitably, the process of definition is a "political " business-an attempt to persuade the Investment/IT and ultimately the user community to define EIP in a manner favoring one’s own vendor or analytical interests. If a vendor gets their favored definition accepted, it gets to say that a competing vendor is not really an EIP vendor, or lacks this or that required EIP characteristic. If an analyst or consultant gets its definition accepted, it gets a boost for its mind share and all the rewards that accompany such a competitive advantage over other consultants or analysts. But if the process of EIP definition is political, it is politics constrained by the reality that any successful EIP definition must offer strategic advantage to the community. It must provide an image of the scope of the EIP area that the community will accept as both providing a clear idea of what an EIP is, and also a vision of wha...|$|E

In late 1998, the institutions' application development group undertook an ambitious program to re-architecture more than 10 years of legacy application development (30 + core applications) into a unified World Wide Web (WWW) environment. The primary project objectives were to construct an environment that would support the rapid development of n-tier, web-based applications while providing standard methods for user authentication/validation, security/access control and definition of a user's organizational context. The project's efforts resulted in Loyola's <b>Enterprise</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Portal</b> (EIP), which meets the aforementioned objectives. This environment: 1) allows access to other vertical Intranet portals (e. g., electronic medical record, patient satisfaction information and faculty effort); 2) supports end-user desktop customization; and 3) provides a means for standardized application “look and feel. ” The portal was constructed utilizing readily available hardware and software. Server hardware consists of multiprocessor (Intel Pentium 500 Mhz) Compaq 6500 servers with one gigabyte of random access memory and 75 gigabytes of hard disk storage. Microsoft SQL Server was selected to house the portal's internal or security data structures. Netscape Enterprise Server was selected for the web server component of the environment and Allaire's ColdFusion was chosen for access and application tiers.
