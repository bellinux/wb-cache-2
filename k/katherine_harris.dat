25|$|Childhood on the American {{frontier}} is contested territory. One {{group of}} scholars, {{following the lead}} of novelists Willa Cather and Laura Ingalls Wilder, argue the rural environment was beneficial to the child's upbringing. Historians <b>Katherine</b> <b>Harris</b> and Elliott West write that rural upbringing allowed children to break loose from urban hierarchies of age and gender, promoted family interdependence, and in the end produced children who were more self-reliant, mobile, adaptable, responsible, independent and more in touch with nature than their urban or eastern counterparts. On the other hand, historians Elizabeth Hampsten and Lillian Schlissel offer a grim portrait of loneliness, privation, abuse, and demanding physical labor from an early age.

With this device, Alvin Liberman, Cooper, and Pierre Delattre (and later joined by <b>Katherine</b> Safford <b>Harris,</b> Leigh Lisker, Arthur Abramson, and others), discovered the acoustic cues for the perception of phonetic segments (consonants and vowels). Liberman and colleagues proposed a motor theory of speech perception to resolve the acoustic complexity: they hypothesized that we perceive speech by tapping into a biological specialization, a speech module, that contains knowledge of the acoustic consequences of articulation. Liberman, aided by Frances Ingemann http://linguistlist.org/people/personal/get-personal-page2.cfm?PersonID=4996 and others, organized {{the results of the}} work on speech cues into a groundbreaking set of rules for speech synthesis by the Pattern Playback http://www.haskins.yale.edu/featured/patplay.html.|$|R
50|$|The pattern {{playback}} is {{an early}} talking device that was built by Dr. Franklin S. Cooper and his colleagues, including John M. Borst and Caryl Haskins, at Haskins Laboratories in the late 1940s and completed in 1950. There were several different versions of this hardware device. Only one currently survives. The machine converts pictures of the acoustic patterns of speech {{in the form of}} a spectrogram back into sound. Using this device, Alvin Liberman, Frank Cooper, and Pierre Delattre (later joined by <b>Katherine</b> Safford <b>Harris,</b> Leigh Lisker, and others) were able to discover acoustic cues for the perception of phonetic segments (consonants and vowels). This research was fundamental to the development of modern techniques of speech synthesis, reading machines for the blind, the study of speech perception and speech recognition, and the development of the motor theory of speech perception.|$|R

Philip Rubin, Louis Goldstein and Mark Tiede http://www.haskins.yale.edu/staff/tiede.html designed a radical revision of the articulatory synthesis model, known as CASY http://www.haskins.yale.edu/facilities/casy.html, the configurable articulatory synthesizer. This 3-dimensional model of the vocal tract permits researchers to replicate MRI images of actual speakers. Douglas Whalen, Goldstein, Rubin and colleagues extended this work to study the relation between speech production and perception. http://www.haskins.yale.edu/newsrelease/A93-2006.html Donald Shankweiler, Susan Brady, Anne Fowler http://www.haskins.yale.edu/staff/fowlera.html, and others explored whether weak memory and perception in poor readers are tied specifically to phonological deficits.

40|$|The module was {{developed}} as an elective to give motivated senior dental students {{an opportunity to}} expand their horizons in planning oral rehabilitation. It comprised one tutor and 12 students, from five universities world-wide, communicating on the World Wide Web (WWW), to develop oral rehabilitation plans for simulated patients. Trigger material came from one of two Case Profiles and consisted of diagnostic casts and details of the clinical and radiographic examination in WWW/CD-ROM form. No background material was supplied as to the "patient’s" age, sex, history or main concern(s). Students worked in groups of three, each student from a different location. Individual students were given a role within the group: "Patient", who developed a "personal background" belonging to the trigger examination material, "Academic" who identified state-of-the-art treatment options available for the dental treatment needs identified by the group and "General Practitioner" who tailored these options to the "patient’s" needs and wants. Student feedback focused on their perception of their experience with the program {{in response to a}} questionnaire comprising 11 structured and four "open" questions. All students felt that the program increased their confidence in planning oral rehabilitation. Ten students felt that the "best thing about the program" was the interaction with students from other universities and the exposure to different philosophies from the different schools. Eight students mentioned their increased awareness of the importance of patient input into holistic planning. Under the heading "What was the worst thing", students cited some technical hitches and the snowball effect of two sluggish students who were not identified early enough and thus impacted negatively on the working of their groups. Student feedback showed that the module succeeded in its aims but needed modification to improve the logistics of working with an extended campus.

5000|$|Franklin S. Cooper and <b>Katherine</b> Safford <b>Harris,</b> {{working with}} Peter MacNeilage, {{were the first}} {{researchers}} in the U.S. to use electromyographic techniques, pioneered at the University of Tokyo, to study the neuromuscular organization of speech. Leigh Lisker and Arthur Abramson looked for simplification {{at the level of}} articulatory action in the voicing of certain contrasting consonants. They showed that many acoustic properties of voicing contrasts arise from variations in voice onset time, the relative phasing of the onset of vocal cord vibration and the end of a consonant. Their work has been widely replicated and elaborated, here and abroad, over the following decades. Donald Shankweiler and Michael Studdert-Kennedy used a dichotic listening technique (presenting different nonsense syllables simultaneously to opposite ears) to demonstrate the dissociation of phonetic (speech) and auditory (nonspeech) perception by finding that phonetic structure devoid of meaning {{is an integral part of}} language, typically processed in the left cerebral hemisphere. Liberman, Cooper, Shankweiler, and Studdert-Kennedy summarized and interpreted fifteen years of research in [...] "Perception of the Speech Code," [...] still among the most cited papers in the speech literature. It set the agenda for many years of research at Haskins and elsewhere by describing speech as a code in which speakers overlap (or coarticulate) segments to form syllables. Researchers at Haskins connected their first computer to a speech synthesizer designed by the Laboratories' engineers. Ignatius Mattingly, with British collaborators, John N. Holmes http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0748408576 and J.N. Shearme http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&id=JASMAN000035000011001911000004&idtype=cvips&gifs=yes, adapted the Pattern playback rules to write the first computer program for synthesizing continuous speech from a phonetically spelled input. A further step toward a reading machine for the blind combined Mattingly's program with an automatic look-up procedure for converting alphabetic text into strings of phonetic symbols.|$|R

Harris was in A Company, 1st Battalion, 4th Marines and was captured by Japanese forces during the Battle of Corregidor in May 1942. He escaped with Edgar Whitcomb, future Governor of Indiana, and on 22 May 1942 swam 8 1/2 hours across Manila Bay to Bataan where he joined Filipino guerrillas fighting Japan just after the Battle of Bataan. In the summer of 1942, Harris and two others left Whitcomb and attempted to sail to China in a motorboat, but the engine failed and the boat drifted for 29 days with little food or water. The monsoon blew them back to an island {{in the southern part of}} the Philippines where they split up and he joined another resistance group. Harris headed towards Australia hoping to rejoin American forces he heard were fighting in Guadalcanal, but he was recaptured in June or September 1943 by Japan on Morotai island, Indonesia, around 1000 mile km from Bataan.|$|R
