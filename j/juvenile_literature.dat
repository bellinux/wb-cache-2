Ellenor Fenn wrote and designed a series of readers and games for middle-class children, including the best-selling Cobwebs to Catch Flies (1784). Richard Lovell Edgeworth began one of the first systematic studies of childhood development which would culminate not only in an educational treatise co-authored with Maria Edgeworth entitled Practical Education (1798), but also in a large body of children's stories by Maria, beginning with The Parent's Assistant (1798).

Poisson regression models indicated that juvenile confinement— measured both dimensionally and categorically—predicted murder arrests despite controls for juvenile homicide offending, juvenile violent delinquency, juvenile felony adjudications, juvenile non-compliance violations, juvenile arrest charges, onset, age, three racial/ethnic classifications, career arrests, career violent index arrests, and career property index arrests.

40|$|Reputation {{enhancement}} {{theory is}} a dominant {{theory in the}} <b>juvenile</b> delinquency <b>literature.</b> It has clearly established that a delinquent identity requires public proof of a deviant disposition and that deviant acts are committed not alone, but {{in the company of}} others.

40|$|In {{this essay}} Adrienne Scullion explores the {{representation}} of war – and in particular of the Second World War – in contemporary theatre for children, considering how the narrative and performative conventions of drama communicate ideas about the conflict to young audiences. She argues that a taxonomy identified in relation to <b>juvenile</b> war <b>literature</b> – discourses of testimony and documentary, propaganda and escapism, myth and metaphor – resonates just as significantly in drama. This proposition is investigated in readings of three recent plays – Stephen Greenhorn's King Matt (TAG, 2001), David Greig's Dr Korczak's Example (TAG, 2001), and Nicola McCartney's Lifeboat (Catherine Wheels, 2002). She proposes that all three plays make different use of the conventions of telling war stories and those of theatrical performance to represent and describe war and, thereby, to explore contemporary values and expressions of citizenship – a declared goal of public policy-making in the UK.

40|$|This {{analysis}} of male peer hierarchies in schools argues that battles for cultural capital {{are a significant}} causal factor in the spate of school shootings across the United States between 1996 and 2002. The hallmarks of normalized masculinity—hypermasculine identification, athletics, fighting, distance from homosexuality, dominant relationships with girls, socioeconomic status, and disdain for academics—do not include alternative ways to build cultural capital when young men do not fit into rigid traditional social structures. Lacking such cultural capital, the perpetrators attempted to prove their mas-culinity through overwhelming violence—responses that in Michel Foucault’s theoreti-cal framework, reinforced the very power structures they {{seemed to want to}} destroy. The analysis concludes with positive directions for change including pedagogical strategies.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review was to detail the human or social service needs and service use {{patterns}} (i. e., healthcare, education, social services, child welfare, mental health, and substance abuse) that influence youth's entry and prolonged involvement with the juvenile justice system.

Extralegal factors, such as individual characteristics (e. g., race/ethnicity, gender, and mental health and trauma histories) and social/environmental characteristics (e. g., family conflict, unmet service needs, and prior social service use) influenced how youth traveled across the sectors of care.

Some suggest that girls are becoming increasingly more delinquent and violent, while others argue that changes in policing and processing account for {{the growing number of}} female offenders. This study explores the idea that girls' arrest rates may be increasing because gendered contextual differences are obscured in broad offense categories, meaning that girls and boys may engage in very different behaviors that lead to similar charges. This study explores the relationships between gender, race, and age and the contextual details of offenses, as discussed in police reports. Using a matched pairs design, bivariate analyses revealed very few statistically significant relationships between these variables. Significant relationships between contextual differences and gender did not exist, and few relationships existed between race and age and contextual details. Understanding the differences, or lack thereof, between boys' and girls' behaviors within similar charges contributes to the greater <b>juvenile</b> justice <b>literature</b> regarding gender.
