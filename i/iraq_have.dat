50|$|For example, two tested {{hypotheses}} {{could be}} that <b>Iraq</b> <b>has</b> WMD or <b>Iraq</b> does not <b>have</b> WMD. If the evidence showed {{that it is more}} likely there are WMDs in Iraq then two new hypotheses could be formulated: WMD are in Baghdad or WMD are in Mosul. Or perhaps, the analyst may need to know what type of WMD Iraq has; the new hypotheses {{could be that}} <b>Iraq</b> <b>has</b> biological WMD, <b>Iraq</b> <b>has</b> chemical WMD and <b>Iraq</b> <b>has</b> nuclear WMD. By giving the ACH structure, the analyst is able to give a nuanced estimate.|$|R

Fifty-six percent assume that most experts believe <b>Iraq</b> <b>had</b> actual WMD and 57 % also assume, incorrectly, that Duelfer concluded <b>Iraq</b> <b>had</b> at least a major WMD program. Kerry supporters hold opposite beliefs on all these points...|$|R

25|$|Although {{there were}} no air strikes against Iran by the United States in June 2005, there were bomb blasts in the {{southern}} west Iranian city of Ahwaz on June 12, 2005.

Scott Ritter as well as other sources have claimed that the United States, after the invasion of <b>Iraq,</b> <b>have</b> been working with Mojahedin-e-Khalq to continue covert operations in Iran.|$|E
25|$|Both Brunei and <b>Iraq</b> <b>have</b> {{expressed}} recent {{interest in}} purchasing SS2s for their militaries.

Jan Pieter Ate of the Indonesian Defense Ministry expressed his concerns that SS2 rifles can be used to threaten other countries and on civilians while University of Indonesia security analyst Andi Widjajanto said that selling the rifles to the country can help improve relations while allowing the black market to lose its presence there.|$|E
25|$|Since 2009, several {{projects}} in Kurdistan, <b>Iraq</b> <b>have</b> been realized. In 2010, the first autogyro was {{handed over to}} the Kurdish Minister of Interiors, Mr. Karim Sinjari. The project for the interior ministry was to train pilots to control and monitor the approach and takeoff paths of the airports in Erbil, Sulaymaniyah, and Dohuk to prevent terrorist encroachments. The gyroplane pilots also form the backbone of the pilot crew of the Kurdish police, who are trained to pilot on Eurocopter EC 120 B helicopters.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the late}} 20th century, an {{increasing}} number of Muslim immigrants from Somalia and <b>Iraq</b> <b>have</b> settled in the city, and international students have increased. By 2009, the ICM's growth made the existing mosque and community center in central Murfreesboro inadequate for the number of worshippers using those facilities. The ICM bought a vacant lot {{on the outskirts of the}} city and submitted plans to build a new community center and mosque on the site. Although the plans were approved unanimously by the local county planning commission, some local residents and anti-Islamic activists opposed the project. Rival demonstrations were held in the town to express support for and opposition to the mosque project.|$|E
25|$|The Persian Journal {{reports that}} the 1975 Algiers {{agreement}} that defines the current Iran-Iraq boundary does not delimit the border beyond the shoreline into the territorial seas in the Persian Gulf, where Iran and <b>Iraq</b> <b>have</b> different approaches to the method that should be used. Iran wishes to divide its maritime boundaries {{on the basis of}} the equidistance principle, whereas Iraq believes the entrance of the Persian Gulf requires special criteria. This incident may have happened in an area that both sides consider as their own territory. Military units may have the right of innocent passage in each other's waters, but this incident involved boarding and compliance inspection and was not simple innocent passage under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.|$|E
25|$|Assyrian {{exodus from}} Iraq from 2003 until present is often {{described}} as ethnic cleansing. Although Iraqi Christians represent less than 5% of the total Iraqi population, they make up 40% of the refugees now living in nearby countries, according to UNHCR. In the 16th century, Christians constituted half of Iraq's population. In 1987, the last Iraqi census counted 1.4 million Christians. Following the 2003 invasion and the reusltant growth of militant Islamism, Christians' total numbers slumped to about 500,000, of whom 250,000 live in Baghdad. Furthermore, the Mandaean and Yazidi communities are at the risk of elimination due to the ongoing atrocities by Islamic extremists. A 25 May 2007 article notes that in the past 7 months only 69 people from <b>Iraq</b> <b>have</b> been granted refugee status in the United States.|$|E

According to the Congressional Research Service, [...] "The U.S. {{government}} holds Hezbollah {{responsible for}} a number of attacks and hostage takings targeting Americans in Lebanon during the 1980s, including the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut in April 1983 and the bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in October 1983, which together killed 258 Americans. Hezbollah’s operations outside of Lebanon, including its participation in bombings of Israeli and Jewish targets in Argentina during the 1990s and more recent training and liaison activities with Shiite insurgents in <b>Iraq,</b> <b>have</b> cemented the organization’s reputation among U.S. policy makers as a capable and deadly adversary with potential global reach." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{large number}} of {{patients}} with minor symptoms recovered completely; those with more serious symptoms improved. This was in contrast to expected outcomes, largely based on analysis of Minamata disease in Japan. In boys with mercury levels below clinical poisoning, a reduction in school performance was noted, although this correlation could not be confirmed. In infants, the mercury poisoning caused central nervous system damage. Relatively low doses caused slower development in children, and abnormal reflexes. Different treatments for mercury poisoning have since been developed, and [...] "quiet baby syndrome", characterised by a baby who never cries, is now a recognised symptom of methylmercury-induced brain damage. Ongoing recommendations of the food regulation authorities have focused on consumption by pregnant women and infant children, noting the particular susceptibility of fetuses and infants to methylmercury poisoning. Data from <b>Iraq</b> <b>have</b> confirmed that methylmercury can pass to a child in utero, and mercury levels were equal to or higher in the newborn child than in the mother.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, {{one year}} after the start of the Shia-led 1990s {{uprising}} in Bahrain, Khalid bin Ahmed publicly distributed a [...] "politically charged poem" [...] that contained [...] "racist and hateful views" [...] of the Shia. One verse of the poem called for [...] "spill their bloods until they all die", another called for [...] "remov them from every sensitive position". Khalaf said the poem was [...] "part of the tribal-cum-ethnic-cum-political mobilization and counter mobilization". According to Michael Field, Khalid [...] "as reputation for being very hard on the Shias". Freedom House mentioned that the Khawalid brothers [...] "espouse a decidedly anti-Shiite agenda, conceiving of the community as a veritable fifth column to be dealt with in the framework of security, rather than through political bargaining". The sectarian violence and rise of Shia powers in <b>Iraq</b> <b>have</b> only strengthened this belief. This view of Shia as a security problem led the Khawalid brothers to consider any economic and political reforms as invalid. Instead they thought that these reforms would only lead the Shia to demand even more.|$|E
