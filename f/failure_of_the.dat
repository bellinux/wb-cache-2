With the founding of Sanctuary Records, an independent record label Idol felt positive about, {{and the formation of}} a new band with Steve Stevens, Idol decided to produce Devil's Playground. Idol's later album featured a more power pop and classic rock sound similar to Idol's 80s style, and received middling reviews.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we study}} state transitions, induced by low-density parity-check codes, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gallager B {{algorithm}} {{in order to}} characterize <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decoder. <b>The</b> <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decoder depend on <b>the</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underlying graph <b>of</b> <b>the</b> code. Two classes of sets, namely trapping sets and propagating sets, <b>of</b> variables <b>of</b> <b>the</b> code are defined to categorize <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decoder. Such a categorization helps to establish a connection between size and population of these sets in the code and the frame error rate performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decoder. This connection is explored to develop a semi-analytical method to estimate the frame error rate of a class of codes from balanced incomplete block designs. I...|$|R

5|$|Media {{attention}} {{centred on}} sabotage, while other speculation ranged from clear-air turbulence to {{an explosion of}} vapour in an empty fuel tank. The Abell Committee focused on six potential aerodynamic and mechanical causes: control flutter (which had led {{to the loss of}} DH 108 prototypes), structural failure due to high loads or metal fatigue of the wing structure, <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> powered flight controls, <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> window panels leading to explosive decompression, or fire and other engine problems. The committee concluded that fire was the most likely cause of the problem, and a number of changes were made to the aircraft to protect the engines and wings from damage that might lead to another fire.|$|E
