40|$|Highlights • Gas hydrate {{reported}} from the Andaman Sea, India after coring and drilling. • <b>Geothermal</b> <b>modeling</b> of base of gas hydrate stability zone. • Gas hydrate stability thickness map of Andaman Sea. • Gas hydrate saturation using rock physics modeling. • Seismic attributes (i. e. reflection strength and instantaneous frequency etc.). Abstract Wide-spread bottom simulating reflectors (BSRs) are observed along available multichannel seismic profiles covering {{an area of}} about 290 km 2 in the Andaman Sea. The seismic data shows that the BSR occurs at places where water depth exceeds 1000 m, and is identified by cross-cutting relationships with the dipping reflectors. The BSR that represents the base of gas hydrate stability field {{can be used to}} infer the gas hydrate stability thickness, which ranges between ∼ 518 m to ∼ 861 m depending on water depths. In situ measurement at site 17 during the Indian National Gas Hydrate Program (NGHP) Expedition- 01 shows very low geothermal gradient 19 ± 2 °C/km. A conductive model was used to determine geothermal gradients from BSRs, which is calculated and varying between 10 °C/km to 40 °C/km. The low geothermal gradient is responsible for the deepest BSR or gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) in the Andaman region and in the world.

Furthermore, transient simulations indicate that leakage into the reservoir is significant; that is, the Wairakei reservoir is not a closed system.

All depth estimates {{must be carefully}} performed and assessed using tectonic framework, geological and shallow as well as deep geophysical evidence, and heat flow modeling, especially in the cases where high values of heat flow are inferred based on magnetic bottoms lying within the upper and middle crust (Ravat et al.

They also added that their depth {{to the bottom of}} magnetic earth's crust was assumed CPD, placing our results within acceptable norms in magnetic depth study (e.g., Trifonova et al. [2009]). In many cases, the approximation of the bottom depth of magnetic earth's crust, generally accepted to concur with the CPD, causes ambiguity, because it is unclear which particular value should be accepted as Curie point. Because of this uncertainty, Trifonova et al.

The seismic data reveal that gas hydrate occurs in the Krishna Godavari Basin at places where water depths exceed 850 m. The thickness of the gas hydrate stability zone inferred from the BSR ranges up to 250 m. A conductive model {{was used to determine}} geothermal gradients and heat flow. Ground truth for the assessment and constraints on the model were provided by downhole measurements obtained during the National Gas Hydrate Program Expedition 01 of India at various sites in the Krishna Godavari Basin. Measured downhole temperature gradients and seafloor-temperatures, sediment thermal conductivities, and seismic velocity are utilized to generate regression functions for these parameters as function of overall water depth. In the first approach the base of gas hydrate stability is predicted from seafloor bathymetry using these regression functions and heat flow and geothermal gradient are calculated. In a second approach the observed BSR depth from the seismic profiles (measured in two-way travel time) is converted into heat flow and geothermal gradient using the same ground-truth data. The geothermal gradient estimated from the BSR varies from 27 to 67 °C/km. Corresponding heat flow values range from 24 to 60 mW/m 2.

The present dissertation focuses on the uncertainties of calculated temperature and heat flow density results and on how they depend on the uncertainties of thermal properties of rocks, {{as well as on}} the relevant boundary conditions. Due to the high number of involved variables of typical models, the random simulation technique was chosen as the applied tool in the analysis. Further, the random simulation technique was applied in inverse Monte Carlo solutions of <b>geothermal</b> <b>models.</b> In addition to modelling technique development, new measurements on thermal conductivity and diffusivity of middle and lower crustal rocks in elevated pressure and temperature were carried out. In the uncertainty analysis it was found that a temperature uncertainty of 50 K at the Moho level, which is at a 50 km's depth in the layered model, is produced by an uncertainty of only 0. 5 W m- 1 K- 1 in thermal conductivity values or 0. 2 orders of magnitude uncertainty in heat production rate (mW m- 3). Similar uncertainties are obtained in Moho temperature, given that the lower boundary condition varies by ± 115 K in temperature (nominal value 1373 K) or ± 1. 7 mW m- 2 in mantle heat-flow density (nominal value 13. 2 mW m- 2). Temperature and pressure dependencies of thermal conductivity are minor in comparison to the previous effects. The inversion results indicated that the Monte Carlo technique is a powerful tool in <b>geothermal</b> <b>modelling.</b> When only surface heat-flow density data are used as a fitting object, temperatures at the depth of 200 km can be inverted with an uncertainty of 120 - 170 K. When petrological temperature-depth (pressure) data on kimberlite-hosted mantle xenoliths were used also as a fitting object, the uncertainty was reduced to 60 - 130 K. The inversion does not remove the ambiguity of the models completely, but it reduces significantly the uncertainty of the temperature results...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{methodology}} to obtain crustal models {{in areas where}} data is sparse and data spreading is heterogeneous. This new method involves both interpolating the depth to the Moho discontinuity between observations and estimating a velocity–depth curve for the crust at each interpolation location. The Moho observations are interpolated using a remove–compute–restore technique, used in for instance geodesy. Observations are corrected first for Airy type isostasy. The residual observations show less variation than the original observations, making interpolation more reliable. After interpolation, the applied correction is restored to the solution, leading to the final estimate of Moho depth. The crustal velocities have been estimated by fitting a velocity–depth curve through available data at each interpolation location. Uncertainty of the model is assessed, both for the Moho and the velocity model. The method has been applied successfully to Asia.

All Archaean plate tectonic models, whether invoking faster spreading rates, similar to today's spreading rates, or longer ridge lengths, essentially propose that continental crust has grown by island arc accretion due to the subduction of oceanic crust. The petrological differences that characterize the Archaean from later terrains result from the subduction of hotter oceanic crust into a hotter mantle. If the oceanic crust was appreciably thicker in the Archaean, as <b>geothermal</b> <b>models</b> would indicate, this thicker crust is surely going to have an effect on tectonic processes. A more valid approach is to compare the possible styles of convergence of thick oceanic crust with modern convergence zones. The best modern analog occurs where thick continental crust is colliding with thick continental crust. Oceanic crustal collision on the scale of the present-day Himalayan continental collision zone may have been a frequent occurrence in the Archaean, resulting in extensive partial melting of the hydrous underthrust oceanic crust to produce voluminous tonalite melts, leaving a depleted stabilized basic residuum.

Development of theory since 1935 from the classic paper of Theis, has provided analysis procedures for different pressure tests in wells. The solutions to respective partial differential equations for dual porosity or fractured systems also found wide application in estimating reservoir properties in geothermal reservoirs. When we analyze the response of a reservoir to pressure disturbances, we assume a model to simulate the system, and properties are estimated from the best fit to this model.
