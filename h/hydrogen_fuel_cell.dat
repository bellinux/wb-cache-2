25|$|The {{four-stroke}} petrol (gasoline) {{internal combustion}} engine that still constitutes the most prevalent form of modern automotive propulsion was patented by Nikolaus Otto. The similar four-stroke diesel engine was invented by Rudolf Diesel. The <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell,</b> one of the technologies hailed {{as a replacement for}} gasoline as an energy source for cars, was discovered in principle by Christian Friedrich Schönbein in 1838. The battery electric car owes its beginnings to Ányos Jedlik, one of the inventors of the electric motor, and Gaston Planté, who invented the lead-acid battery in 1859.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, the Roadster's battery-to-wheel motor {{efficiency}} was reported as 88% to 90% on average and 80% at peak power. For comparison, internal combustion engines have a tank-to-wheel efficiency of about 15%. Taking {{a more complete}} picture including the cost of energy drawn from its source, Tesla reports that their technology, assuming electricity generated from natural gas-burning power plants, has a high well-to-wheel efficiency of 1.14 kilometers per megajoule, compared to 0.202km/MJ for gasoline-powered sports cars, 0.478km/MJ for gasoline-powered commuter cars, 0.556km/MJ for hybrid cars, and 0.348km/MJ for <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> vehicles.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to this pure hydrogen type, there are hydrocarbon fuels for fuel cells, including diesel, methanol (see: direct-methanol fuel cells and indirect methanol fuel cells) and chemical hydrides. The waste products with these types of fuel are carbon dioxide and water. When hydrogen is used, the CO2 is released when methane from natural gas is combined with steam, in a process called steam methane reforming, to produce the hydrogen. This can {{take place in a}} different location to the fuel cell, potentially allowing the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> to be used indoors—for example, in fork lifts.|$|E

40|$|Hydrogen {{has been}} widely touted as a {{solution}} to the looming crisis of energy security and climate change. <b>Hydrogen</b> in <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> can be used to power vehicles with the emission of only water. Providing hydrogen on a national scale in the United States, however, will be difficult. Hydrogen for transportation would require an enormous change in America's infrastructure, with a need to build a sprawling <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fueling</b> system throughout the country. Recently, Tellus Institute, in a long-term scenario study of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> for transportation, has made clear that <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> for car transportation could only be a viable option with massive investments in infrastructure along with large-scale carbon sequestration.
