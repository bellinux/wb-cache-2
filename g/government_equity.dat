50|$|Greater {{autonomy}} {{was proposed}} for the public sector banks {{in order for them}} to function with equivalent professionalism as their international counterparts. For this the panel recommended that recruitment procedures, training and remuneration policies of public sector banks be brought in line with the best-market-practices of professional bank management. Secondly, the committee recommended GOI equity in nationalized banks be reduced to 33% for increased autonomy. It also recommended the RBI relinquish its seats on the board of directors of these banks. The committee further added that given that the government nominees to the board of banks are often members of parliament, politicians, bureaucrats, etc., they often interfere in the day-to-day operations of the bank in the form of the behest-lending. As such the committee recommended a review of functions of banks boards with a view to make them responsible for enhancing shareholder value through formulation of corporate strategy and reduction of the <b>government</b> <b>equity.</b>|$|E
5000|$|THE MORAUTA GOVERNMENT The Morauta {{government}} {{was in office}} from 14 July 1999 till 5th of August 2002 and deployed far reaching initiatives. The most urgent task when coming to power was macro economic stabilization [...] Morauta looked back with satisfaction in his last budget speech before the election in 2002 on lower interest rates, lower inflation and a more stable currency. This had been achieved {{with the support of}} the International Financial Institutions and the Australian government. [...] Second, the financial structure of PNG was reformed. The independence of the Central Bank was restored and reinforced. The government withdrew from the banking sector. Government used to be a major player in the banking sector through the Papua New Guinea Banking Corporation (PNGBC). This bank was privatised. The state owned enterprises were brought together under a holding company called the Independent Public Business Corporation (IPBC). This was supposed to be a shell company that refrained as much as possible from direct management of the businesses under its control. Its core function was to stimulate the privatisation of SOES and managing the dividends that came from those enterprises. [...] Thirdly there were major political reforms aimed at strengthening party formation. MPs used to shift allegiances easily and created therefore political instability. The Organic Law on the Integrity of Political Parties and Candidates (OLIPPAC) had as its main provision that MPS had to remain loyal to the Prime Minister they had chosen whether they had supported on a party platform or as independents. It proscribed crossing the floor on virtual all issues. It also laid down a framework for the organisation and registration of political parties. Similarly the electoral system was changed from a First Past the Post system to a system of Limited Preferential Voting. The idea was that candidates under such a system would approach other candidates searching for support in voters casting second or more preferences. This would stimulate cooperation between candidates and encourage stable party formation. [...] Fourthly, government involvement in the natural resources sector was reorganised. Previous governments had involved themselves more and more with managing such resources through equity participation. Oregon Minerals Ltd was the major vehicle to bring government and private investment together in natural resources projects. The Morauta government sold the government’s 51% controlling interest in Oregon to Oil Search Ltd. Government withdrew therefore from direct management and was merely drawing dividends from Oil Search. A different vehicle was created for the big Ok Tedi mine in Western Province. BHP was the controlling interest and manager of this mine. A tailings dam broke and BHP was faced with big claims of environmental damages. BHP wanted to avoid these and these were settled by transferring their shares to an entity representing the people of Western Province : the Papua New Guinea Sustainable Development Fund. Income from these shares was used for development projects in Western province and Papua New Guinea as a whole. However one third of that income was paid in a trust account in Singapore as a reserve for the people in Western Province when the mine would be exhausted. The Mineral Resources Development Corporation (MRDC) remained in existence. It was originally also a vehicle for <b>government</b> <b>equity</b> participation. However, its mission was limited ehen Orogen was established. Its task was to administer the equity interest of landowner groups and provincial governments in natural resources projects.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} the standard neoclassical model (SNM) {{of the impact}} of immigration on the incomes of the resident (pre-immigration) population. We augment the SNM to allow for foreign ownership of and <b>government</b> <b>equity</b> in the capital stock. Using the expanded model, four back-of-the-envelope (BOTE) calculations are made. The calculations reveal that the size of the Berry-Soligo welfare triangle is small and is dominated by the effects of foreign ownership of capital and <b>government</b> <b>equity</b> in capital. In our preferred scenario, the BOTE calculation indicates that the 1991 - 92 Australian immigrant intake reduced residents' income. We believe the results of the BOTE calculations justify a more comprehensive study incorporating a range of other influential factors determining the impact of immigration on residents' income. We suggest a list of such factors and report on work done in these specific areas. Essential to a comprehensive study are the integration of results from studies in specific areas, and the devotion of resources to the tasks of further data collection and model development. immigration, residents' income, capital mobility, <b>government</b> <b>equity,</b> Berry-Soligo effect...|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to explain}} how internationally {{accepted}} accounting standards are currently applied in the budget statement treatment of the national broadband network (NBN) and how future NBN related transactions {{are likely to be}} treated under those standards. Recent media commentary and political debate has concerned the validity of the current accounting treatment of the NBN in the federal government budget statements. This background note (BN) also aims to clarify some of the terms and arguments commonly used during commentary on this topic. For example, the terms on-budget and off-budget, and the notion that the accounting treatment of the NBN is dependent on the rate of return realised by the NBN, are discussed in the section below. The body of the note then examines the accounting treatment of past and potential future NBN related transactions, given three assumed stages of NBN activity. Finally, this BN looks at whether the NBN can be accounted for as an expense item in the budget operating statement and then presents the methodology used to value the <b>government’s</b> <b>equity</b> investment in NBN Company (NBN Co) ...|$|R
