500|$|As the German {{ground forces}} {{advanced}} across the Ukraine in August and September, the air units of JG52 kept pace – constantly {{moving on to}} forward airbases. The Gruppe was involved in providing cover for the southern crossings over the Dneiper, the capture of Poltava, the First Battle of Kharkov and then crossing the Perekop isthmus into the Crimea. They often flew three or four missions a day when weather permitted. [...] By the end of October Graf was mastering his flying technique, becoming adept at low-level flying, and had achieved 20 victories. The rains arrived in November, turning the airfields to mud and limiting air operations {{and the number of}} serviceable aircraft. Graf’s unit was moved forward to Taganrog to support the battle for Rostov. Once the snow arrived, freezing the ground, operations picked up again. In heavy combat over and around the see-saw battle, Graf had doubled his score to 42 by the end of 1941, making him one of the Gruppe’s leading pilots. On New Year’s Day 1942, III./JG52 was transferred to the relative comfort of the large Kharkov-Rogan airfield, with its closed hangars. The blizzard conditions (often <b>getting</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> −20°C overnight) made flying virtually impossible. On 24 January, Graf was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for his victories to date. Soon after, he was sent on rotation back home on leave. Within a month, his regular wingman, Steinbatz, was also awarded the Knight’s Cross for a similar score.|$|E
2500|$|At {{some point}} in the early twentieth century, the eagle had been painted brown and white to mimic the natural colors of a bald eagle, and this was how the piece looked when it arrived at The Mariners' Museum in 1934. [...] In 1960, museum workers scraped off all of the brown and white paint, <b>getting</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the bare wood. [...] A base coat was then applied, after which the eagle was gold leafed to return it to its {{original}} look.|$|E

2500|$|... "By {{the second}} Test at Eden Park, Auckland, we had {{improved}} a lot. It was a Test match {{we could have}} won, rather than should have won. Had our wing from Randwick, John Flett, touched the ball down {{when he reached the}} New Zealand line, we could have made 20-17 with the kick to come – considering we had come back from the dead, we were on a roll. But John lost the ball over the line and our hopes disappeared with that lost, bouncing ball. The Blacks, typically, made good their fortune by <b>getting</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the other end and scoring the points which made such they clinced not only the Test but also the series. Another series against New Zealand had gone west; we were plunged into the ultimate depression." ...|$|E
2500|$|Location scouts {{had searched}} the {{entirety}} of Georgia for an aged, isolated oceanfront property {{to use as a}} home for the Millers for nearly three months before scout Andy Young came across the [...] "Adams Cottage" [...] on the southern end of Tybee Island. [...] "It was <b>getting</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> ," [...] said Young. [...] "Often, it's about the house. It can be a character itself in the movie." [...] The house's owner, Sam Adams, welcomed filming as [...] "an opportunity to sort of immortalize the house," [...] in case it is destroyed by storms. The two-story, six bedroom house was built by Adams' great-grandfather in 1918 and was made entirely out of hard pine wood with very few painted surfaces. According to Savannah Morning News reporter Lesley Conn, it [...] "was built in classic rambling beach style [...] to allow ocean breezes to sweep through wide, wraparound porches into cool, heart-pine rooms." ...|$|E
