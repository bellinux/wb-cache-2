[...] "When young trainees come to see me and give me videos telling me to check out what they are doing, I just take the tape and throw it away. What I'm interested in is what the guy's got in his head, if he has self-confidence, if he masters the technique, if he has understood the principles of parkour. I just can't deal with guys who do Parkour because they saw videos on the Internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better." [...] Further, he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations, and developing in their own way. [...] "When a young person asks me: 'Can you show me how to do this?' I simply answer: [...] "No, I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> I do it. Then, you'll have to learn with your own technique, your own way of moving, your style, your abilities and your limitations. You are going to learn to be yourself, not someone else." ...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper will}} teach you Internet {{techniques}} that can improve the management of your software development projects, and any other projects that your group, department or company may have. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> to use your browser, a Web site, and some basic tools like Qedit for Windows to simplify project management. There is more to project management than just knowing if the project is on schedule. Traditional tools like MS Project do this, and well, but they do little else. The rest of project management is sharing information and results throughout the project team, {{and that is the}} primary topic of this paper. The issues addressed are task collaboration, sharing, distribution and updating of digital products, testing, and detailed communication within the team (see "Working Together" by Bennett in the References) ...|$|E

These programs are designed to prepare you for an entry level job as a Fire Fighter or an Emergency Medical Technician. So if you like helping people, this career could be for you. Come to the Rare Book and Paper Show, which will feature more than 30 vendors {{from all over the}} U.

Whatever your career choice is, you can probably prepare for it at College of DuPage. As a matter of fact, last October COD held two conferences on alternative careers. The first was “Finding Your Fit in the Career Puzzle,” a symposium focusing on jobs in the field of art, design, photography and more. The second event was called “Taking the Road Less Traveled: Non-Traditional Careers for All Learners. ” With holiday celebrations looming on the horizon, you may be thinking about your holiday menu.

40|$|A {{transcendental}} {{argument is}} an argument of the form ‘Experience has feature F. If experience has feature F, then the external world has feature G. So the external world has feature G. ’ Kant and others have attempted to use arguments of this form to argue against sceptics {{about the existence of}} the external world. 1 In this chapter I’m not going to argue against any sceptics, but I’m <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> certain very plausible assumptions about experience can lead to surprising conclusions about how certain experiences are physically realized. In particular, you’ll see how to travel transcendentally from facts about experience to facts about the spatial properties of the brain. 2 But to get that far will take us a while. To begin with, let me remind you of the frequently discussed possibility of ‘spectrum inversion’. 3 The familiar hypothesis is that the qualitative character of your colour experience might differ system-atically from mine. So, for example, when I see a red object, my colour experience might be qualitatively like yours is when you see a green object, and vice versa. Further, it is claimed, since there is a (non-trivial) isomorphism from the colour-space on to itself that preserves all the basic qualitative similarities and differences between colours, this could occur without resultant differences in our (ordinary) behaviour. It is this supposed symmetry that is meant to allow for the possibility of non-manifest spectrum inversion. The starting point for my discussion is the idea of qualitative inversion with respect to another perceived feature of the local environment—its left/right I {{would like to thank the}} following people for helpful and inspiring comments and discussion...|$|E
