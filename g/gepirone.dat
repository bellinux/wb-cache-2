50|$|Fabre-Kramer Pharmaceuticals is a {{pharmaceutical}} company {{that specializes in}} the development of psychotropic drugs. Products in their current development pipeline include <b>gepirone</b> and FKB01MD for major depression, <b>gepirone</b> and FKW00GA for generalized anxiety disorder, <b>gepirone</b> for hypoactive sexual desire disorder, FKF02SC for schizophrenia, and FKK01PD for Parkinson's disease.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gepirone</b> (INN; (current {{developmental}} {{code name}} TGFK07AD; proposed brand name Travivo) or <b>gepirone</b> hydrochloride (USAN) is an antidepressant and anxiolytic drug of the azapirone {{group that was}} synthesized by Bristol-Myers Squibb in 1986 and has been under development {{for the treatment of}} depression but has yet to be marketed. Like other azapirones, it acts as a selective partial agonist of the 5-HT1A receptor. <b>Gepirone</b> has been under development in the U.S. in an extended release form (referred to as <b>gepirone</b> ER), but despite completing phase III clinical trials and demonstrating efficacy, it has been rejected multiple times by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) during the drug approval process.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gepirone</b> was {{originally}} developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, but was out-licensed to Fabre-Kramer in 1993. The FDA rejected approval for <b>gepirone</b> in 2004. It was submitted for the preregistration (NDA) phase again in May 2007 after adding additional information from clinical trials as the FDA required in 2004. However, in 2007 it once again failed {{to convince the}} FDA of its qualities for treating anxiety and depression. In December 2015, the FDA once again gave <b>gepirone</b> a negative review for depression due to concerns of efficacy. However, in March 2016, the FDA reversed its decision and gave <b>gepirone</b> ER a positive review, {{clearing the way for}} the drug to finally gain market approval in the U.S.|$|E
50|$|Structural analogues of {{buspirone}} include tandospirone, <b>gepirone,</b> and perospirone.|$|E
50|$|Unlike its {{relative}} buspirone, <b>gepirone</b> has negligible {{affinity for the}} D2 receptor (30- to 50-fold lower in comparison), and its efficacy in activating the 5-HT1A is {{greater than that of}} buspirone. However, similarly to buspirone, <b>gepirone</b> metabolizes into 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)piperazine, which is known to act as an antagonist of the α2-adrenergic receptor.|$|E
50|$|The {{company has}} also {{conducted}} clinical studies on a <b>gepirone</b> extended release formulation for major depression.|$|E
5000|$|Azapirones such as buspirone, <b>gepirone,</b> and {{tandospirone}} are 5-HT1A agonists marketed {{primarily as}} anxiolytics, but also recently as antidepressants ...|$|E
5000|$|Tandospirone {{has also}} been used to augment {{antipsychotics}} in Japan as it improves cognitive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Buspirone is being investigated for this purpose as well. [...] <b>Gepirone</b> was abandoned after FDA rejection.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to its antidepressant and anxiolytic properties, <b>gepirone</b> {{has been found to}} improve symptoms of sexual dysfunction in men and women, similarly to the marketed 5-HT1A receptor agonist flibanserin. Moreover, the pro-sexual effects appear to be independent of its antidepressant and anxiolytic effects.|$|E
50|$|Tandospirone (brand name Sediel) is an {{anxiolytic}} and antidepressant drug used in China and Japan, {{where it}} is marketed by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma. It {{is a member of}} the azapirone class of drugs and is closely related to other azapirones like buspirone and <b>gepirone.</b>|$|E
50|$|Metabolism of azapirones {{occurs in}} the liver and they are {{excreted}} in urine and feces. A common metabolite of several azapirones including buspirone, <b>gepirone,</b> ipsapirone, revospirone, and tandospirone is 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)piperazine (1-PP). 1-PP possesses 5-HT1A partial agonist and α2-adrenergic antagonist actions and likely contributes overall mostly to side effects.|$|E
5000|$|... 5-HT1A {{receptor}} agonists like buspirone and flesinoxan show efficacy in relieving {{anxiety and}} depression, and buspirone and tandospirone are currently approved for these indications {{in various parts}} of the world. Others such as <b>gepirone,</b> flesinoxan, flibanserin, and naluzotan have also been investigated, though none have been fully developed and approved yet. Some of the atypical antipsychotics like aripiprazole are also partial agonists at the 5-HT1A receptor and are sometimes used in low doses as augmentations to standard antidepressants like the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E
50|$|Azapirones {{are poorly}} but {{nonetheless}} appreciably absorbed {{and have a}} rapid onset of action, but have only very short half-lives ranging from 1-3 hours. As a result, they must be administered 2-3 times a day. The only exception to this rule is umespirone, which has a very long duration with a single dose lasting as long as 23 hours. Unfortunately, umespirone has not been commercialized. Although never commercially produced, Bristol-Myers Squibb applied for a patent on Oct 28, 1993 and received the patent on Jul 11, 1995 for an extended release formulation of buspirone. An extended release formulation of <b>gepirone</b> is currently under development and if approved, should help to improve this issue.|$|E
50|$|While {{some of the}} listed {{properties}} such as 5-HT2A and D2 blockade may {{be useful}} in certain indications such as in the treatment of schizophrenia (as with perospirone and tiospirone), all of them except 5-HT1A agonism are generally undesirable in anxiolytics and only contribute to side effects. As a result, further development has commenced to bring more selective of anxiolytic agents to the market. An example of this initiative is <b>gepirone,</b> which is currently in clinical trials in the United States for the treatment of major depression and generalized anxiety disorder. Another example is tandospirone which has been licensed in Japan for the treatment of anxiety and as an augmentation to antidepressants for depression.|$|E
40|$|Abnormal timing in the {{circadian}} {{system is}} reported in endogenous depression. <b>Gepirone,</b> a 5 HT(1 A) receptor partial agonist, has anxiolytic and antidepressant properties. We determined whether <b>gepirone</b> {{was able to}} modify {{the functioning of the}} circadian system. Single i. p. injections of <b>gepirone</b> in hamsters induced phase-advances in the circadian activity rhythm when administered during the subjective day, but had no effect when given during the subjective night. Single i. p. <b>gepirone</b> injections also blocked the phase-shifting effects of a light pulse, at a time when <b>gepirone</b> by itself had no effect on the activity rhythm. Chronic <b>gepirone</b> treatment in hamsters kept under a 14 / 10 light-dark cycle induced a phase-advance in the activity rhythm, modifying the phase-relationship between this rhythm and the light-dark cycle. After transfer to constant darkness, gepirone-treated hamsters showed a shortened free-running period of activity, compared to controls. Both acute and chronic <b>gepirone</b> treatment thus have major effects on the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity in rodents. In view of the hypothetized role for disturbed circadian rhythms in the pathophysiology of depression, and the use of 5 HT-related drugs for its treatment, the results provide further support for the possibility that some of the therapeutic effects of these compounds may be due to their effects on temporal organization.

Following <b>gepirone</b> {{there was a significant}} decrease in body temperature and moderate increases in subjective reports of light-headedness, nausea and drowsiness. Our results are consistent with studies in rodents suggesting that 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonists increase ACTH and prolactin secretion and decrease body temperature.

40|$|The {{effect of}} lithium {{administration}} (800 mg daily for 7 days) on the neuroendocrine and temperature {{responses to the}} 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist, <b>gepirone,</b> was studied in eight healthy male volunteers. <b>Gepirone</b> (20 mg orally) significantly increased plasma levels of prolactin, growth hormone, corticotropin and cortisol, and lowered oral temperature. None of these responses was significantly altered by lithium treatment. The {{results suggest that the}} ability of short-term lithium treatment to increase 5 -HT-mediated neuroendocrine responses in humans is unlikely to be related to changes in the sensitivity of pre- or post-synaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptors...|$|E
40|$|Animal {{experimental}} {{studies suggest that}} the therapeutic effect of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may involve neuroadaptive changes in pre- and post-synaptic serotonin 1 A (5 -HT 1 A) receptors. We used the endocrine and hypothermic responses to the 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist, <b>gepirone</b> (20 mg orally), to assess 5 -HT 1 A receptor sensitivity in 37 healthy male volunteers who were studied before and following random double-blind, allocation to treatment with paroxetine, nefazodone or placebo for 17 days. Following antidepressant drug treatment, hypothermic responses to <b>gepirone</b> were markedly decreased by paroxetine but only slightly diminished by nefazodone. Paroxetine also lowered the growth hormone and cortisol responses to <b>gepirone.</b> There was no change in either hypothermic or endocrine response following placebo treatment. Our results suggest that paroxetine treatment produces a striking attenuation of measures of both pre- and post-synaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptor function. Nefazodone appears to decrease the sensitivity of 5 -HT 1 A autoreceptors to some extent and this effect may contribute to its antidepressant activity...|$|E
40|$|An interim {{analysis}} of 41 evaluable patients compared <b>gepirone</b> to placebo treatment in a randomized, double-blind, 12 -week study of cocaine dependence without opiate abuse.

Both treatment groups showed similar modest, average improvements during the study in all treatment measures. Adverse events were not treatment limiting.

40|$|Several {{cationic}} amphiphilic compounds {{are known}} to induce phospholipidosis, a condition primarily characterized by excessive accumulation of phospholipids in different cell types, giving the affected cells a finely foamy appearance. Excessive storage of lamellar membranous intralysosomal inclusion bodies is the hallmark for phospholipidosis on the electron microscopic level. In case of alveolar phospholipidosis, foamy macrophages accumulate within the alveolar spaces of the lung. Based on such findings in a one-year toxicity study with <b>gepirone</b> in rats, we studied the molecular properties of this compound and compounds suspected of being phospholipidosis inducers by means of physicochemical calculations. Physicochemical molecular calculations of molecular weight, ClogP (partition coefficient octanol/water), logD at pH 7. 4, and pKa were performed, for the cationic amphiphilic compounds chlorpromazine, amiodarone, imipramine, propranolol and fluoxetine, and for the structurally related compounds 1 -phenylpiperazine (1 -PHP), <b>gepirone</b> (and its major metabolites, 3 -OH-gepirone and 1 -pyrimidinylpiperazine [1 -PP]), and buspirone. ClogP and calculated pKa cluster differently for the amphiphilic drugs compared to the chemical series of piperazines. In line with this analysis, lamellar inclusion bodies were found in an in vitro validation experiment in the human monoblastoid cell line U- 937, incubated for 96 h at 10 microg/mL with cationic amphiphilic drugs (amiodarone, imipramine, or propranolol). No such lamellar inclusion bodies were seen {{for any of the}} compounds from the chemical series of piperazines including <b>gepirone</b> and its metabolites. The data presented support the use of simple physicochemical calculations of ClogP and pKa to discriminate rapidly between compounds suspected of being phospholipidosis inducers. Finally, the discriminative power of these physicochemical ClogP and pKa calculations to predict phospholipidosis-inducing potential was further validated by extension of the set of compounds...|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} recent {{claims that the}} 5 -HT 1 A agonist 8 -hydroxy- 2 -(di-n-propylamino) {{tetralin}} (8 -OH-DPAT) elicits chewing and eating of solid but not liquid foods. Therefore, the effects of 8 -OH-DPAT and another 5 -HT 1 A agonist <b>gepirone</b> on the consumption of a liquid chow diet, by free feeding male rats, were examined. Both drugs produced a dose-dependent increase in the consumption of liquid diet during a 2 h test. The doses of 8 -OH-DPAT and <b>gepirone</b> which increased liquid diet intake {{in this study were}} in the same range as those which were found previously to increase food pellet consumption by free feeding rats. The effects of 8 -OH-DPAT were also examined in a feeding choice test in which free feeding animals were allowed to choose between food pellets and a liquid chow diet. In this test, 8 -OH-DPAT significantly increased total food intake (liquid plus pellet) but had no significant effect on the consumption of either liquid or pellet diets when analysed separately. Thus, there were large individual differences in diet choice after 8 -OH-DPAT injection. However, rats did not consistently choose to eat food pellets rather than the liquid diet, as would be predicted if the drug elicited chewing rather than eating. These results provide strong evidence that 8 -OH-DPAT elicits a behaviourally specific hyperphagia and not chewing or gnawing...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} an interresponse-time analysis of {{performance on a}} differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate 72 -s schedule. This analysis compares the obtained interresponse-time distribution of individual rats to a corresponding random interresponse-time distribution. The random interresponse-time distribution is a negative exponential probability function; it predicts the relative distribution of interresponse times if the rat emitted {{the same number of}} responses randomly (i. e., with a constant probability) with respect to time. The analysis provides quantitative measures of peak location and dispersion of the interresponse times toward random performance. In Experiment 1, an unexpected outcome of this analysis was that the rats would have obtained more reinforcers had they responded at the same rate but randomly. Based on the interresponse-time analysis in Experiment 1, it was shown that rats trained on the differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate 72 -s schedule could increase the number of reinforcers obtained in two ways: first, by a coherent shift of the interresponse-time distribution toward longer durations and, second, by dispersal of the interresponse times toward a random interresponse-time distribution. Experiment 2 applied the analysis described in Experiment 1 to the effects of desipramine and <b>gepirone.</b> Both drugs decreased response rate and increased reinforcement rate, but their effects on the distribution of interresponse times were different. The increase in reinforcement rate observed with desipramine was accompanied by a coherent shift of the reinforcement rate observed with <b>gepirone</b> was accompanied by dispersal of the interresponse-time distribution toward the random negative exponential prediction...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the 5 -hydroxytryptaminelA (5 -HT 1 A) agonist buspirone stimulated rat prolactin (PRL) secretion. Administration of the 5 -HT 1 agonists <b>gepirone</b> (GEP) or ipsapirone (IPS) s. c. in doses from 1 to 10 mg/kg had no effect on PRL secretion in male rats. However, pretreatment with GEP (1 0 mg/kg) or IPS (1 0 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the increase in serum PAL concentration elicited by the 5 -HT agonists 5 -methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine or 6 -chloro- 2 -(1 -piperazinyl) -pyrazine (MK- 21 2). To determine whether the inhibitory effect of GEP or IPS was related to a serotonergic mechanism or a more general inhibitory effect on PAL secretion, the ability of GEP and IPS to inhibit the haloperi-dol- or a-methyl-p-tyrosine-induced increase in PAL secretion was studied. GEP (1, 3 and 1 0 mg/kg) and IPS (1 0 mg/kg) inhibited the increase in PAL secretion produced by either halo...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that ra'ss positive, palatability-dependent consummatory {{reactions}} to infused tastes are selectively facilitated by a benzodiazepine agonist (chlordiazepoxide), and that this effect can be blocked by the coadministration of benzodiazepine antagonists (e. g., Ro 15 - 1788). The {{purpose of the present study}} was to determine whether agents acting at other receptor sites (dopaminergic, serotonergic), which have been shown to modulate food consumption, might also modify rats' palatability-dependent reactivity to infused tastes. In this experiment, the benzodiazepine agonist, diazepam, facilitated positive palatability reactions, while dopaminergic agents (haloperidol, apomorphine, amphetamine) had no significant effects on either positive or aversive reactions. The putative 5 -HT 1 A agonists, buspirone and <b>gepirone,</b> had a general inhibitory action on both positive and aversive palatability reactions. These results are surprising in view of the effects of serotonergic and dopaminergic agents on food and fluid intake. Our results suggest that the benzodiazepine receptor system may play a special role in the neural control of appetite through its enhancement of the positive palatability of tastes. Dopamine systems, by contrast, appear to control food intake by modulating processes that are independent of food affect evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Changes to 5 -HT$ sb 2 $ receptors in rat brain {{following}} antidepressant and anxiolytic treatment were investigated. The B$ sb{ rm max}$ of ($ sp{ 125 }$I) AMIK {{was found}} to be decreased significantly in rat fronto-parietal cortex after 21 days administration of antidepressant drugs including desmethylimipramine (30 %), buspirone (47 %) and adinazolam (17 %). The anxiolytic drug, diazepam, which is devoid of intrinsic antidepressant action, did not significantly change the binding parameters. In comparison to 5 -HT$ sb 2 $ receptors, the beta-adrenoceptors labelled by ($ sp{ 125 }$I) cyanopindolol in membrane binding were decreased only by desmethylimipramine, with a 17 % reduction in B$ sb{ rm max}$. Data from in-vitro quantitative autoradiography suggests that ($ sp{ 125 }$I) AMIK binding to 5 -HT$ sb 2 $ receptors is decreased in frontal and parietal cortices following 21 days administration of DMI, amitryptiline, <b>gepirone</b> and adinazolam. The results from the present study strongly suggest that the 5 -HT$ sb 2 $ receptor is involved in depressive disorders. Since some of the antidepressant drugs tested possess anxiolytic activity after prolonged administration, 5 -HT$ sb 2 $ receptors may also be important in anxiety disorders...|$|E
40|$|We report {{here the}} first direct {{functional}} {{evidence of an}} increase in the tonic activation of postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptors by antidepressant treatments. Because 5 -HT 1 A receptor activation hyperpolarizes and inhibits CA 3 pyramidal neurons in the dorsal hippocampus, we determined, using in vivo extracellular recording, whether the selective 5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonist WAY 100635 could disinhibit these neurons. Unexpectedly, no disinhibition could be detected in controls. However, after long-term treatment with the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine, the selective 5 -HT reuptake inhibitor paroxetine, the reversible monoamine oxidase-A inhibitor befloxatone, the � 2 -adrenergic antagonist mirtazapine, or the 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist <b>gepirone</b> or multiple electroconvulsive shock (ECS) administration, WAY 100635 markedly increased (60 – 200 %) the firing activity of CA 3 pyramidal neurons. Such a disinhibition was absent in rats treated with the nonantidepressant drug chlorpromazine, in rats receiving only one ECS, or in rats receiving multiple ECSs in combination with an intrahippocampal pertussis toxin treatment to inactivate G i/o-coupled 5 -HT 1 A receptors. These data indicate that such antidepressant treatments, acting on entirely different primary targets, might alleviate depression by enhancing the tonic activation of forebrain postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptors...|$|E
40|$|The learned {{helplessness}} (LH) paradigm {{is characterized by}} learning deficits resulting from inescapable events. The aims {{of the present study}} were to determine if protein-calorie malnutrition (PCM) alters learning deficits induced by LH and if the neurochemical changes induced by malnutrition alter the reactivity to treatment with GABA-ergic and serotonergic drugs during LH. Well-nourished (W) and PCM Wistar rats (61 days old) were exposed or not to inescapable shocks (IS) and treated with <b>gepirone</b> (GEP, 0. 0 - 7. 5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, N = 128) or chlordiazepoxide (0. 0 - 7. 5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, N = 128) 72 h later, 30 min before the test session (30 trials of escape learning). The results showed that rats exposed to IS had higher escape latency than non-exposed rats (12. 6 ± 2. 2 vs 4. 4 ± 0. 8 s) and that malnutrition increased learning impairment produced by LH. GEP increased the escape latency of W animals exposed or non-exposed to IS, but did not affect the response of PCM animals, while chlordiazepoxide reduced the escape deficit of both W and PCM rats. The data suggest that PCM animals were more sensitive to the impairment produced by LH and that PCM led to neurochemical changes in the serotonergic system, resulting in hyporeactivity to the anxiogenic effects of GEP in the LH paradigm.

40|$|Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} suggest an involvement of serotonin$ sb{ rm 1 A}$ (5 -HT$ sb{ rm 1 A}$ receptors {{in the regulation}} of emotions. In order to investigate the molecular basis of recent electrophysiological findings which implicated 5 -HT$ sb{ rm 1 A}$ receptors in the mechanism of action of antidepressants and anxiolytics, radioligand binding and autoradiographic studies using tritiated 8 -hydroxy- 2 -(di-N-propylamino) -tetralin (($ sp 3 $H) - 8 -OH-DPAT) were done in rat brain following various treatments. These included: the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine; the reuptake blockers paroxetine and indalpine; the monoamine oxidase inhibitor clorgyline; electroconvulsive shock; lithium; the classic benzodiazepine diazepam; and the 5 -HT$ sb{ rm 1 A}$ partial agonist <b>gepirone.</b> None of these treatments, nor the fluctuation in 5 -HT availability provoked by the circadian cycle, gave any significant changes, {{with the exception of}} clorgyline which initially appeared to decrease the affinity of ($ sp 3 $H) - 8 -OH-DPAT for its receptor. A further series of studies in vitro and in vivo ascertained the possibility that the 5 -HT$ sb{ rm 1 A}$ receptors may display two interconvertible affinity states and that, in fact, clorgyline induces a shift of the high to the lower affinity state. The findings from this second series of experiments suggested that labile changes, which may possibly be disrupted during membrane preparation, in the coupling between the 5 -HT$ sb{ rm 1 A}$ receptor and a guanine nucleotide binding protein (G-protein) may account for the effects that certain treatments have on 5 -HT$ sb{ rm 1 A}$ receptor responsiveness...|$|E

The selective dopamine D 1 antagonists SCH 23390 and SCH 39166 dose-dependently blocked spontaneous and DOI head-shakes but the selective dopamine D 2 antagonists sulpiride and raclopride were ineffective. The 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonists 8 -OH-DPAT, ipsapirone, <b>gepirone,</b> MDL 73005 EF and buspirone (i. p) dose-dependently blocked DOI head-shakes, pindolol blocked the inhibitory effect of 8 -OH-DPAT on DOI head-shakes. Parachlorophenylalanine blocked the inhibitory effect of 8 -OH-DPAT and buspirone, suggesting that the 5 -HT 1 A receptor involved is located presynaptically. The alpha- 2 adrenoceptor antagonists yohimbine, idazoxan, 1 -PP and RX 811059 prevented the inhibitory effect of 8 -OH-DPAT on DOI head-shakes suggesting that this 5 -HT 1 A - 5 -HT 2 receptor interaction is under the modulatory control of adrenoceptors. Because kynurenine has previously been found to potentiate head-shaking, plasma kynurenine concentrations were measured in seven TS patients and {{were significantly higher than}} controls, but neopterin and biopterin were unchanged.

The 5 -HT 2 agonist DOI and the 5 -HT 2 antagonist ritanserin were anxiolytic while ICI 169, 369, a 5 -HT 2 antagonist was inactive. All 5 -HT 3 antagonists tested were inactive in this test, while the indirect serotomimetics zimeldine and fenfluramine were anxiogenic. Neither beta-adrenoceptor agonists nor antagonists had reproducible effects on anxiety in this model. Combined beta- 1 /beta- 2 adrenoceptor antagonists reversed the anxiogenic effects of 8 -OH-DPAT while selective beta- 1 or beta- 2 antagonists did not. On the social interaction model the 5 -HT 1 agonists 8 -OH-DPAT, RU 24969 and 5 -MeODMT were anxiogenic and ipsapirone was anxiolytic. The 5 -HT 2 agonist DOI and the beta-adrenoceptor- and 5 -HT- antagonist pindolol were anxiolytic, while the 5 -HT 2 and 5 -HT 3 antagonists were inactive.

40|$|The {{results of}} an {{investigation}} into how stressors interact with the action of serotonergic agents in animal models of anxiety are presented. Water deprivation and restraint both increased plasma corticosterone concentrations and elevated 5 -HT turnover. In the elevated X-maze, water deprivation had a duration-dependent "anxiolytic" effect. The effect of restraint was dependent on the duration of restraint and was to inhibit maze exploration. Water-deprivation did not influence the action of diazepam or any 5 -HT 1 A ligand in the X-maze. Restraint switched the "anxiogenic" effect of 8 - 0 H-DPAT to either "anxiolytic" or inactive, depending on the time after the restraint when testing was performed. The Vogel conflict test detected an "anxiolytic" "anxiolytic"V"anxiolytic""anxiolytic" effect of buspirone which was additive with "anxiolytic" effects of pindolol and propranolol. Diazepam and fluoxetine were also active, but 8 - 0 H-DPAT, ipsapirone, <b>gepirone</b> and yohimbine were inactive. In the elevated X-maze, "anxiogenic" responses to picrotoxin, flumazenil, RU 24969, CGS 12066 B, fluoxetine and 8 - 0 H-DPAT were detected. Other 5 -HT 1 A ligands were inactive. Diazepam and corticosterone had "anxiolytic" effects. Increasing light intensity did not change behaviour on the elevated X-maze, but was able to reverse the effect of 8 - OH-DPAT to an "anxiolytic" action. This effect was attributed to a presynaptic mechanism, because it was abolished by pCPA. The occurence of different behaviours in different reglons of the maze was shown to be susceptible to modulation by "anxiolytic" and "anxiogenic" drugs. These results {{are discussed in the}} context of there being at least two separate 5 -HT mechanisms which are involved in the control of anxiety...|$|E
40|$|Fluoxetine, a {{serotonin}} (5 -HT) reuptake inhibitor, {{has been}} documented to exert a protective action against convulsive seizures in animal models, when administered either systemically, or focally into substantia nigra. It {{is likely that the}} mechanism of anticonvulsant action of fluoxetine is due to an enhancement of endogenous 5 -HT transmission. To evaluate this possibility {{in the context of the}} anticonvulsant action of intranigral fluoxetine, we examined the influence of 5 -HT-mediated transmission in substantia nigra on seizure susceptibility in a rat model of focally evoked complex partial seizures. In addition to fluoxetine (3. 5 nmol), we found that the directly acting 5 -HT receptor agonists, 1 -[3 -(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]piperazine (TFMPP) (10 nmol), 1 -(3 -cnlorophenyl) piperazine (m-CPP) (7. 4 nmol), <b>gepirone</b> (70 nmol) and 2 -dipropylamino- 8 -hydroxy- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydronaphthalene hydrobromide (8 -OH-DPAT) (10 nmol), when microinjected bilaterally into substantia nigra, protected rats from limbic motor seizures evoked focally from area tempestas, an epileptogenic site in the deep rostral piriform cortex. This indicates that multiple 5 -HT receptor subtypes in substantia nigra may contribute to seizure regulation. Consistent with this, the 5 -HT antagonist, metergoline, partially reversed the anticonvulsant action of intranigral fluoxetine. Depletion of endogenous 5 -HT, by pretreatment with parachlorophenylalanine (PCPA), completely prevented the anticonvulsant action of intranigral fluoxetine, without modifying the anticonvulsant effect of intranigral TFMPP. These findings support the proposal that the anticonvulsant action of fluoxetine in substantia nigra is due to an enhancement of the synaptic action of endogenous 5 -HT in substantia nigra which in turn is mediated via multiple 5 -HT receptors. Endogenous 5 -HT transmission in substantia nigra is therefore capable of limiting the development and propagation of seizure activity generated in limbic circuits...|$|E
