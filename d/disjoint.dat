5|$|As {{the points}} of any smooth simple closed curve move in this way, the curve remains simple and smooth. It loses area at a {{constant}} rate, and its perimeter decreases {{as quickly as possible}} for any continuous curve evolution. If the curve is non-convex, its total absolute curvature decreases monotonically, until it becomes convex. Once convex, the isoperimetric ratio of the curve decreases as the curve converges to a circular shape, before collapsing to a single point of singularity. If two <b>disjoint</b> simple smooth closed curves evolve, they remain <b>disjoint</b> until one of them collapses to a point.|$|E

5|$|For any graph G = (V,E), we may {{define a}} matroid {{on the edges}} of G, in which a set of edges is {{independent}} if and only if it forms a pseudoforest; this matroid is known as the bicircular matroid (or bicycle matroid) of G. The smallest dependent sets for this matroid are the minimal connected subgraphs of G that have more than one cycle, and these subgraphs are sometimes called bicycles. There are three possible types of bicycle: a theta graph has two vertices that are connected by three internally <b>disjoint</b> paths, a figure 8 graph consists of two cycles sharing a single vertex, and a handcuff graph is formed by two <b>disjoint</b> cycles connected by a path.|$|E

5|$|If two <b>disjoint</b> smooth simple closed curves {{undergo the}} curve-shortening flow simultaneously, they remain <b>disjoint</b> as the flow progresses. The reason is that, if two smooth curves {{move in a}} way that creates a {{crossing}}, then at the time of first crossing the curves would necessarily be tangent to each other, without crossing. But, in such a situation, the two curves' curvatures at the point of tangency would necessarily pull them apart rather than pushing them together into a crossing. For the same reason, a single simple closed curve can never evolve to cross itself. This phenomenon is known as the avoidance principle.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} duality applies {{as well to}} {{infinite}} graphs embedded in the plane {{as it does to}} finite graphs. However, care is needed to avoid topological complications such as points of the plane that are neither part of an open region <b>disjoint</b> from the graph nor part of an edge or vertex of the graph. When all faces are bounded regions surrounded by a cycle of the graph, an infinite planar graph embedding can also be viewed as a tessellation of the plane, a covering of the plane by closed disks (the tiles of the tessellation) whose interiors (the faces of the embedding) are <b>disjoint</b> open disks. Planar duality gives rise to the notion of a dual tessellation, a tessellation formed by placing a vertex at the center of each tile and connecting the centers of adjacent tiles.|$|E

Inversion in one such intersection point F renders the constructed circles into straight lines emanating from F and the two given circles into concentric circles, with the third given circle becoming another circle (in general).

5|$|As {{discussed}} above, any non-pseudoforest graph contains as a subgraph a handcuff, {{figure 8}}, or theta graph; any handcuff or figure 8 graph may be contracted {{to form a}} butterfly graph (five-vertex figure 8), and any theta graph may be contracted to form a diamond graph (four-vertex theta graph), so any non-pseudoforest contains either a butterfly or a diamond as a minor, {{and these are the}} only minor-minimal non-pseudoforest graphs. Thus, a graph is a pseudoforest if and only if it does not have the butterfly or the diamond as a minor.

5|$|In {{the years}} {{leading up to}} the {{outbreak}} of the First World War the NUWSS spent its time in north Wales organising educational and propaganda campaigns. In south Wales friction was caused by a shift in political views pushed onto the country from the central office. 1912 saw the NUWSS switch its policy as a non-party organisation to set up the Election Fighting Fund (EFF) to support the newly burgeoning Labour Party. Wales had traditionally been a Liberal heartland and the South Wales Federation of Women’s Suffrage Societies was opposed to this new policy. There was a sense that there was a <b>disjoint</b> between the central 'English feminist agenda' pushed by the militant headquarters and the needs of Welsh social, cultural and political views.

40|$|International audienceLet G a {{weighted}} connexe graph. In this paper, we are interesting by covering the vertices of G by connexe <b>disjoints</b> unicyclic components with minimum total cost. We propose two polynomial algorithms, {{the first is}} based on the construction of a matroïd on this graph, and the second is to calculate in polynomial time a maximum matching with minimum cost on an induced graph constructed on the initial one. We prove that this two methods have the same result which is <b>disjoints</b> connexe unicyclic components with minimum total cost. In a second time, we are interesting by obtain a partition of unicyclic components with a minimum total cost by adding a girth constraint. Then the problem becomes difficult, and to solve it, we propose a polyhedral study in which we show many facets and valid inequalities. Some of them can be exactly separated in polynomial time. Then we solve the problem by a cutting plane algorithm based on these inequalities and using a compact formulation issued from the transversality of the bicircular matroïd. We also show a new valid inequality related to the upper bound of the number of unicyclic components obtained after the partition. The problem has practical and important applications in the design of telecommunication network...|$|R
