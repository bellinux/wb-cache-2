40|$|An {{account is}} given of night {{observations}} of oblique-incidence pulse transmissions on 5. 8 Mc/s. over a baseline of 763 km., using a responder technique. The experiment aimed at measuring apparent path lengths {{as a guide}} to the identification of the reflecting layer in the ionosphere. The characteristics of beacon triggering are discussed in relation to the echo system received after ionospheric reflection. A correlation of Es occurrences as observed at oblique incidence and vertical incidence near the midpoint of the trajectory was effected, and certain characteristics of the Es layer are presented. Unusual records of Pedersen rays are reproduced and sudden height increases and diffuseness of F 2 echoes are discussed. A check on the oblique-incidence theory using a Millington transmission curve on vertical-incidence h′f records yielded reasonable agreement between measured and deduced reflection heights, although there is evidence of a tendency for the predicted obliquity factor to be too low. A rough analysis of oblique-incidence penetrations yielded an average value for the frequency separation of the magneto-ionic M. U. F. ’s close to half the <b>gyromagnetic</b> <b>frequency...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{positional}} and polarization {{characteristics of}} Type III bursts {{in the range}} 24 - 220 MHz {{as measured by the}} Culgoora radioheliograph, spectrograph and spectropolarimeter are reported. The study includes 997 bursts which are of two classes: fundamental-harmonic (F-H) pairs and 'structureless' bursts with no visible F-H structure, and concentrates on the polarization of the bursts and the variation of polarization from centre to limb. The observed centre-to-limb decrease in polarization approximately follows a cosine law. This decrease is not as predicted by simple theory but is consistent with other observations which imply that open field lines from an active region diverge strongly. The observed o-mode polarization of harmonic radiation implies that the wave vectors of Langmuir waves are always parallel, within about 20 deg, to the magnetic field, while the constancy of H polarization with frequency implies that the ratio of <b>gyromagnetic</b> to plasma <b>frequency,</b> the Alfven speed and the plasma beta are constant with height on the open field lines above an active region. Finally, it is inferred that some factor, in addition to the magnetic field strength, controls the polarization of F radiation...|$|R
