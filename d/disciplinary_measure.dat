In the literary study specific {{attention has been paid to}} the evaluation of <b>disciplinary</b> <b>measures</b> with reference to laws, regulations and departmental guidelines. A synopsis in connection with the juridical and pedagogical character of <b>disciplinary</b> <b>measures</b> has been completed especially as far as the following aspects are concerned: authority, order, discipline, the principles of judiciary education, the disposition of educative discipline, directives for <b>disciplinary</b> <b>measures,</b> reasons for pupils being undisciplined and forms of <b>disciplinary</b> <b>measures.</b> An empirical investigation has clearly indicated problems experienced by principals of primary schools. Limitations concerning the evaluation of <b>disciplinary</b> <b>measures</b> and ways of implementing in-service training, have been established. It has been concluded that some principals do not possess of any qualifications in connection with educational management. Principals should establish which instruments are suitable for corporal punishment, which teachers are allowed to inflict such punishment with the principal's consent and where such punishment should be administered. The disciplinary climate in the school and that at home has much in common. Corporal punishment cannot be done away with. Principals should also try to ascertain the reasons for undisciplined conduct in schools and how verbal and non-verbal <b>disciplinary</b> <b>measures</b> can be sophisticated. Guidelines have been laid down and recommendations have been made for the evaluation of <b>disciplinary</b> <b>measures</b> by principals in the primary schools in the Transvaal. Master...|$|R

This {{is based on the}} fact that undisciplined workforce may lead to disorder in the workplace and eventually to an organisation's failure to reach its objectives. From a population of four hundred workers and one hundred managers. a simple random sampling technique was used to select sixty workers and forty managers. Data was collected through a structured questionnaire made up of six different sections. The data collected was sorted, coded and analysed using SPSS. Frequency counts and mean deviations were used to describe the data. The results of the study show that 47 percent of the workers and 35 percent of managers are between 30 to 40 years old. About 69 percent of workers are female while 70 percent of the managers are male. The common educational level among workers is matric while managers had Diploma and BSc degree. In terms of attitude to <b>disciplinary</b> <b>measures,</b> seventy three percent of workers agree that <b>disciplinary</b> <b>measures</b> are legal at BPH as opposed to eight percent who disagree. Seventy five percent of managers agree that <b>disciplinary</b> <b>measures</b> are legal whilst twelve percent agreed. Sixty percent of workers disagreed that <b>disciplinary</b> <b>measures</b> are non sequential at BPH whilst thirteen percent agree. In terms of knowledge of <b>disciplinary</b> <b>measures,</b> sixty six percent of workers at BPH are aware of written warning and Employee Assistance Programmes as disciplinary techniques. Sixty five percent of workers at BPH are aware of the final written warning, verbal warning and counselling as disciplinary techniques. Sixty one percent of workers at BPH are least commonly aware of the Performance Management and Development System as a disciplinary technique. Results on implementation of <b>disciplinary</b> <b>measures</b> show that seventy percent of worker mostly had verbal warnings: sixty eight percent final written warning and sixty six percent salary deductions and written warnings as <b>disciplinary</b> <b>measures</b> used against them. Fifty six percent of workers least had withholding all privileges; fifty percent demotion and forty five percent withholding certain privileges as <b>disciplinary</b> <b>measures</b> used against them. Seventy percent of managers mostly had verbal warnings: sixty eight percent final written warnings and sixty six percent salary deduct ions and written warnings as <b>disciplinary</b> <b>measures</b> used against them. Fifty six percent of managers least had withholding all privileges; fifty percent demotions and forty five percent withholding certain privileges as <b>disciplinary</b> <b>measures</b> used against them. With respect to constraints to the implementation of <b>disciplinary</b> <b>measures,</b> forty percent of BPH workers cited head office taking too long, unions being too defensive whilst workers were resistant. Twenty six percent cited unqualified managers as one of the most common constraints towards the implementation of <b>disciplinary</b> <b>measures.</b> The study concludes by advocating the need to review and enforce discipline at the work place if service delivery has to improve.

This triggered a collapse and India lost the match that could well have been saved. Patil was dropped in the next test at Kolkata as a <b>disciplinary</b> <b>measure,</b> along with Kapil Dev who also fell to a similar shot off the bowling of Pat Pocock. Mohammad Azharuddin who took his place scored hundreds in his first three Test matches and Patil played no more Test cricket, although Kapil Dev would return to squad. In 1986, he was recalled for a few more one day matches. He also toured England without appearing in Tests.|$|E
25|$|Corporal {{punishment}} is prohibited in schools {{but it is}} still widely practiced. Both students (34%) and teachers (25%) reported corporal punishment by teachers and parents against girls in school. Apart from corporal punishment, mainly older boys beat up girls to harass and degrade them or in retaliation for a refusal to initiate a sexual relationship. Male students might snatch girls' school materials, intimidate them and threaten to harm them as a way of forcing them into sexual relationships. Parents could take girls' property as a <b>disciplinary</b> <b>measure.</b> School teachers were reported to humiliate and verbally abuse girls in class and this was worse if the girl was attractive. In the school community, girls most frequently suffered verbal abuse aimed at undermining their self-esteem. Other abuse involved touching private parts and punishment for refusing sexual requests. School girls might experience various forms of seduction before being subjected to sexually violent acts. This could be from school boys, teachers or rich sugar daddies who waited outside school gates.|$|E

This practice was abolished on 5 September 1940, when restriction of midshipmen to their rooms in Bancroft Hall was substituted as a <b>disciplinary</b> <b>measure.</b>|$|E
40|$|Party group leaders {{seemingly}} use {{a variety}} of <b>disciplinary</b> <b>measures</b> to achieve unified voting behavior in party groups. However, there is little systematic knowledge about the nature of such <b>disciplinary</b> <b>measures</b> and the interaction between leaders and group members remains a black box. Most studies of party voting concentrate on institutional variables such as electoral systems and take <b>disciplinary</b> <b>measures</b> as a given. This study presents a new way to measure party discipline, based on data from semi-structured interviews with 76 party group leaders and experts from five European parliaments. The discipline index provided here is the first to consider in a systematic way the means available to reprimand or reward party group members. In a second step, the study shows that <b>disciplinary</b> <b>measures</b> can compensate for a leader’s lack of control over candidate selection processes, and relate to group composition or size...|$|R

It isn’t a judgment of guilt. It isn't a <b>disciplinary</b> <b>measure.</b> And what we've done is to use the interim to try {{to understand the nature of}} the case better.

Though why an officer of the British merchant service should answer the questions of any king, emperor, autocrat, or senator of any foreign power (as to an event in which a British ship alone was concerned, and which did not even take place in the territorial waters of that power) passes my understanding. The only authority he is bound to answer is the Board of Trade. But with what face the Board of Trade, which, having made the regulations for 10,000 ton ships, put its dear old bald head under its wing for ten years, took it out only to shelve an important report, and with a dreary murmur, [...] "Unsinkable," [...] put it back again, in the hope of not being disturbed for another ten years, with what face it will be putting questions to that man who has done his duty, as to the facts of this disaster and as to his professional conduct in it--well, I don't know! I have the greatest respect for our established authorities. I am a disciplined man, and I have a natural indulgence for the weaknesses of human institutions; but I will own that at times I have regretted their--how shall I say it?--their imponderability. A Board of Trade--what is it? A Board of [...] . I believe the Speaker of the Irish Parliament is {{one of the members of}} it. A ghost. Less than that; as yet a mere memory.

And what more? The name of a politician--a party man! Less than nothing; a mere void without as much as a shadow of responsibility cast into it from that light in which move the masses of men who work, who deal in things and face the realities--not the words--of this life.|$|E
