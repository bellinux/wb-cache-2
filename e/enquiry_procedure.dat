It was more appropriate to order the parties to trial. The affidavits in this case were not lengthy; they contained all the necessary averments and defined the issues with sufficient clarity. It would have been pointless, therefore, to order a filing of pleadings. The court, to save time and further expense, ordered the affidavits to stand as pleadings which were closed.|$|R
40|$|Many {{within the}} science {{education}} community and beyond see practical work {{carried out by}} students as an essential feature of science education. Questions have, however, been raised by some science educators about its effectiveness as a teaching and learning strategy. This study explored the effectiveness of practical work by analysing a sample of 25 'typical' science lessons involving practical work in English secondary schools. Data {{took the form of}} observational field notes and tape-recorded interviews with teachers and students. The analysis used a model of effectiveness {{based on the work of}} Millar et al. (1999) and Tiberghien (2000). The teacher's focus in these lessons was predominantly on developing students' substantive scientific knowledge, rather than on developing understanding of scientific <b>enquiry</b> <b>procedures.</b> Practical work was generally effective in getting students to do what is intended with physical objects, but much less effective in getting them to use the intended scientific ideas to guide their actions and reflect upon the data they collect. There was little evidence that the cognitive challenge of linking observables to ideas is recognised by those who design practical activities for science lessons. Tasks rarely incorporated explicit strategies to help students to make such links, or were presented in class in ways which reflected the size of the learning demand. The analytical framework used in this study offers a means of assessing the learning demand of practical tasks, and identifying those which require specific support for students' thinking and learning in order to be effective...|$|R
40|$|This essay {{brings into}} light the {{possible}} Greek elements in Ibn Khaldun’s philosophical thoughts. A historian and civilizationist by profession, Ibn Khaldun {{did not write}} philosophy book per se. Instead, he published Muqaddima, a prolegomena of history, where the major part of his philosophical ideas is centered. This study is mainly to carry out textual investigation on the Muqaddima, to trace and determine the manner and nature of Greek elements and/or the influence of Greek philosophy in Ibn Khaldun’s thoughts and how far can he {{be linked to the}} Greeks. Some conclusion will be drawn on whether or not Ibn Khaldun carried any signs of the Greek philosophy and, if any, in what manner and to what extent did he employ Greek methods in his philosophic <b>enquiries</b> and <b>procedure</b> of analysis of human society? This essay will be based on textual analysis of the Muqaddima...|$|R
5000|$|The {{incident}} {{is a matter}} of some controversy. One source [...] states Jastrząb was escorting PQ 15, i.e. travelling with the convoy. Others however [...] state she was covering PQ 15’s passage by patrolling the Norwegian coast against a sortie by German capital ships, one of five submarines so assigned. These sources state Jastrząb was out of position; Pertek however states that it was the convoy which was out of position, and other sources confirm the convoy had altered course to avoid ice. The position of the incident, 200 miles from the Norwegian coast is inconsistent with a mission to patrol that coast, typically no more than 10 to 20 miles out. Pertek also (after Romanowskis testimony) states Jastrząb was fired upon despite showing yellow recognition smoke candles; however other sources do not confirm this. Finally Pertek states the commanders of St Albans and Seagull were found guilty at a court martial over the incident; Kemp states that the court of <b>enquiry</b> (a normal <b>procedure</b> following the loss of a ship, though not of friendly fire cases) found no blame could be attributed to either commander. It is not possible to reconcile these accounts.|$|R
40|$|The Dutch Roads and Railways Act {{took effect}} on 1 January 1994. This Act has {{shortened}} {{the length of}} public <b>enquiries</b> and administrative <b>procedures</b> surrounding decisions on new route proposals {{to a maximum of}} three years. The new Act has also prompted a review of the Department of Public Work's Guidelines on Decision-making for Strategic Infrastructure projects. This report evaluates the draft copy of these revised Guidelines in respect to road safety. The report focuses mainly on the procedures applied to proposed highways including motorways and dual carriageways. The report describes in detail the road safety role in the procedures employed in the five decision-making phases used in the Guidelines. The report assess the quality of the road safety input in each of these phases. The report suggests how this quality in each context can be improved. The report concludes that the new Act provides more opportunities for utilising the road safety aspect as a decision-making criterion than are exploited in the draft copy of the revised Guidelines. The report lists possible solutions/road safety surveys which could improve the input of the road safety aspect in the project reports. The report also discusses the planning procedures applied to dangerous highways...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{validity}} in principle of educational theory. Part One examines current controversy over its status. Via the Hirst/O'Connor debate, central issues are identified: {{the relation of}} theory to practice; the logical status of prescriptive theory; the epistemic foundations of normative statements; the validity of behavioural science; the putative discreteness of empirical and normative questions in education. The presumed potential validity of the former and the supposed arbitrariness of the latter are claimed to reflect acceptance of a positivist paradigm both mistaken and unfruitful in this context. Part Two disputes philosophers' disclaimers for their substantive role in prescription, which arise in reaction against illegitimate deductions from metaphysical positions, and in conformity with the tenets of analytic philosophy. Supporting claims - that conceptual analysis reveals truths both non-empirical and value-free, and that the normative regress leaves judgements unsupported - are questioned. Analysis simply clarifies conditions for conceptual revision whilst the normative regress similarly implies a coherence theory of truth only mistakenly equated with irrationality. Part Three disputes the corollary that empirical questions in education are discrete and logically unproblematic. After establishing the logical and methodological characteristics of behavioural <b>enquiry,</b> the assumptions, <b>procedures</b> and findings of a large-scale positivist research project are examined to show that this approach to empirical work in education is as necessarily distorting and supportive of theorists' ideology as is exclusive reliance on conceptual analysis in normative theorising. Increased validity in educational theory is argued to depend on rejection of positivist norms of rationality and on adoption of a more tentative, piecemeal approach which admits an anthropomorphic model of man, the relevance of practical knowledge and the functional interdependence of factual and normative enquiry...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the work of}} V. Gordon Childe (1892 - 1957). {{one of the most}} outstanding figures in the development of archaeology. Childe was unique among his contemporaries not only for his exceptional achievement in synthesising European and Oriental prehistory on a hitherto unprecedented scale, but also for the depth of his methodo¬ logical, theoretical and ultimately philosophical <b>enquiry</b> into archaeological <b>procedure.</b> Although Childe himself especially valued his contribution to archaeology as the originator of new interpretative concepts and methods of explanation, his explicitly theoretical work is not widely known today and indeed was largely ignored by his contem¬ poraries. Here an attempt is made to redress the balance, not by depreciating Childe's role as a synthesiser, nor by overstating his explicit concern with theory, but rather by viewing both these aspects of his work as integral parts of an overall enquiry into prehistory. The thesis thus begins with an outline of the develop¬ ment of Childe's synthesis of European and Oriental prehistory in relationship to the development of his theoretical frame¬ work. This is followed by a more detailed analysis of the theoretical content of the synthesis itself and by a closer examination of his work on archaeological classification, historical theory and philosophy of knowledge. In tracing Childe's intellectual genesis and development from his entry iiinto archaeology in the early twenties to his tragic death in 1957, one follows a remarkable Journey through philolo¬ gical theory, Oriental diffusionism, functionalism, Darwinism and Marxism. The picture which emerges is one of an archaeologist grappling with complex and often contra¬ dictory theoretical systems, in an attempt not only to perceive the patterns in prehistory, but to understand the historical process itself...|$|R
40|$|These Studies in the {{interpretation}} of Genesis 26. 1 - 33 are concerned with a relatively brief and well defined section of biblical Hebrew narrative, and following an Introduction are divided into two parts reflecting literary and historical interests respectively. The Introduction takes note of the current interest among Old Testament scholars in the literary interpretation of the biblical materials and, after opting for an approach which will take account of both literary and historical-critical <b>enquiry,</b> outlines the <b>procedure</b> which will be followed. No logical priority is claimed for literary analysis, although it is considered appropriate that it should be pursued prior to any historical enquiry. In this way, it has been possible to avoid any suspicion that literary analysis of the type pursued here is a further development of the historical-critical method. Part One (Chapters One - Four) is concerned to construct a literary interpretation of the text of Gen 26. 1 - 33. The interpretation consists of three main studies of the Isaac narrative which are followed by a brief discussion of certain aspects of the method involved. This interpretation has developed in the main from a reflection upon the relationship which appears to exist between the promise made to the patriarch by the deity and the surrounding narrative material. Beginning from a literary-structural analysis of the Isaac narrative, it has been possible to observe that a number of relationships of a literary and structural nature exist between the promise and the surrounding narrative materials. The exploration of these relationships discloses a series of tensions between the promise and the narrated events which {{in one way or another}} seem designed to bring the fulfilment of different aspects of the promise under threat, and each of these tensions are resolved in turn in the narrative. Thus, even even if the events narrated appear to run counter to the direction of the promise, it is in the exploration of this dialectic which is set up between promise and those narrative events which tend to threaten the fulfilment of the promise that the beginnings of a satisfactory literary interpretation of Gen 26. 1 - 33 is to be found. The literary interpretation of the Isaac narrative is carried out in three stages. In the first stage (Chapter One), the extent of the material under consideration is narrowed down to Gen 26. 1 - 33, and other material (notably Gen 25. 19 - 26) is excluded. Once the narrative structure has been analyzed in terms of divine promise, threat, and (partial) resolution, a further brief examination of the narrative context of the other divine promise sections in Genesis 12 - 36 shows that the literary technique of juxtaposing these same three elements has in fact been applied more widely, even if it is most clearly evident in Gen 26. 1 - 33. An analysis of the role Rebekah plays in the wife-sister episode shows that she is clearly a subsidiary character, and that in the narrative Abimelech the Philistine king of Gerar and Isaac's antagonist throughout is the character closest in importance to Isaac. Indeed, in many respects the narrative appears to explore the relationship which exists between Isaac and the Philistine king. A number of literary features which enhance the impression of unity which has already been gained from the structural analysis are examined. In particular, a number of narrative transformations are seen to take place between the beginning and the end of the narrative. These are largely concerned with the situation of Isaac in relation to Abimelech. At the beginning of the narrative Isaac comes to Abimelech at Gerar and is dependent on the latter's good will for his wellbeing. But at the end of the narrative, Abimelech comes to Isaac at Beersheba, in order to participate in the blessing enjoyed by the Patriarch. In the second stage (Chapter Two), the structure of each of the episodes which combine to form the Isaac narrative is examined, using a form of structural analysis used by Bremond in relation to the fairy tale, but which is also appropriate to the analysis of other simple forms of narrative. This examination, which I have used to determine whether the individual episodes maintain a comic or tragic function within the Isaac narrative, is carried out without prejudice to the assumption that the narrative is a unity at some level. One of the impressive features of the Isaac narrative is that the Patriarch does not achieve his good fortune at the expense of Abimelech and his people, but the Philistines also prosper, and it is seen that this effect has been achieved by means of paradox. The discussion of the individual episodes leads to the conclusion that the ability of the narrative as a whole to generate meaning is greater than the sum of its parts. In the third stage (Chapter Three), I have attempted to construct an appropriate 'narrative background' against which the text may be understood. This exercise involves the careful observation of such signals as are raised in the text and appear to direct one's attention to materials elsewhere in the tradition, and particularly among the narratives of Genesis 12 - 25, which may combine to serve as a background against which the Isaac narrative may be understood, and which might properly enrich one's understanding of the text. This undertaking begins from the point that no text may be properly understood from within a vacuum, and that while it is proper to begin such a literary-structural investigation as has been undertaken in this Thesis from a detailed study of the text itself, it has been considered necessary to go on from there and to provide a richer understanding of the text. The formation of a 'narrative background' is to be distinguished from the method of 'narrative analogy' (Miscall, Alter) so far as it takes the canonical ordering of the narratives more seriously. Part One is concluded with the discussion of a number of methodological issues in Chapter Four which forms an attempt to say something about the aims and validity of the analyses set out in Chapters One-Three. There is no concern, however, to resume systematically issues which have already been raised in the earlier chapters. In Part Two, I have addressed some of the more usual historical concerns of biblical studies. The first main part of Chapter Five is concerned with the form-critical discussion of the Isaac narrative. An examination of the form-critical studies of Lutz. and Coats is followed by an analysis of the structure and content of Gen 26. 1 - 33. The analysis is then filled out by a broad discussion which is informed to some extent by the earlier discussion of Chapter One, particularly by the degree to which the various episodes were there seen to be related to each other. The fact that, apart from vv 1 - 6, the episodes all required assumption of information provided by one or another of the preceding episodes in order to appear coherent suggests that the unity of Gen 26. 1 - 33 is perhaps more than the result of a collector stringing them together in terms of the common theme "Isaac and the people of Gerar". This observation sets an obvious limit against the usual formcritical criterion which holds that the most original units were concered to narrate only single episodes. Throughout this discussion the results of current studies in folklore which have led to much uncertainty concerning the stability of oral transmission so that it is no longer possible to be so confident in the antiquity of the pentateuchal tradition were taken for granted. The traditio-historical question of priority is examined, and it is concluded that Abraham is in fact prior to Isaac. Further examination of questions relating to the compositional history of Gen 26. 1 - 33 support the conclusion that this section is a composite narrative composed of a variety of materials which were formerly associated with Abraham, and a very little new material. The occurrences of the name "Isaac" outside of Genesis are all discussed (Chapter Six), and these provide no evidence to suggest that an Isaac tradition existed much before the time of the Deuteronomic writer. The references to Isaac in Amos are unique in that they seem to refer to tribal and/or geographical entities. There is also some difficulty in the fact that the versions appear to have had some problems with these references. This discussion tends to offer a measure of support for recent theories concerning the late dating of much of the patriarchal material. In the "Concluding Remarks", some of the more important results of the literary and historical analyses are surveyed, and the relationship between the two styles of biblical study which they represent is discussed. Although it is possible to pursue either literary or historical studies independently of the other, that relationship is seen to be, in the main, a complementary one, although it is argued that historicalcritical analysis benefits from taking careful account of the literary structure and the content of the biblical materials. Where this is not done, unfortunate mistakes can easily arise. </p...|$|R
