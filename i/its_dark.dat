5|$|Tylopilus alboater is a {{mycorrhizal}} species, and its fruit bodies grow on {{the ground}} solitarily, scattered, or in groups under deciduous trees, particularly oak. Fruiting occurs in deciduous, coniferous, and mixed forests. <b>Its</b> <b>dark</b> color {{makes it difficult to}} notice in the field.|$|E
5|$|A long-standing {{mystery of}} Venus {{observations}} {{is the so-called}} ashen light—an apparent weak illumination of <b>its</b> <b>dark</b> side, seen when the planet is in the crescent phase. The first claimed observation of ashen light was made in 1643, but {{the existence of the}} illumination has never been reliably confirmed. Observers have speculated it may result from electrical activity in the Venusian atmosphere, but it could be illusory, resulting from the physiological effect of observing a bright, crescent-shaped object.|$|E
5|$|Alex Parker, {{the leader}} of the team that {{performed}} the analysis of the images at the Southwest Research Institute, said that S/2015 (136472) 1's orbit appears to be aligned edge-on to Earth-based observatories. This would make it much more difficult to detect because it would be lost in Makemake's glare much of the time and, along with <b>its</b> <b>dark</b> surface, would contribute to previous surveys failing to observe it.|$|E

50|$|It can be {{distinguished}} from Astroloba foliolosa by <b>its</b> <b>darker</b> green colour, and by its larger, less compact, more spreading leaves.|$|R
5|$|Collybia cirrhata is {{most likely}} to be {{confused}} with the remaining members of Collybia, which have a similar external appearance. C.tuberosa is distinguished by <b>its</b> <b>dark</b> reddish-brown sclerotia that resemble apple seeds, while C.cookei has wrinkled, often irregularly shaped sclerotia that are pale yellow to orange. Other similar mushrooms include Baeospora myosura and species of Strobilurus, but these species only grow on pine cones.|$|E
5|$|Geastrum welwitschii {{also has}} similar {{morphological}} characters to G.minimum in having small fruit bodies, whitish spore sacs, and fibrillose peristomes. However G.welwitschii is differentiated from G.minimum by its fornicate, mostly 3–6, {{rays of the}} exoperidia, and the mycelial layer that easily loosens from the fibrous layer to form a mycelial cup. G.welwitschii is distinguished from G.entomophilum by <b>its</b> <b>dark</b> and sessile endoperidium, and smaller spores (2.8–3.5μm).|$|E
5|$|Palencia-Roth {{notes that}} critics {{have been struck}} by the humorless elegiac style of The General in His Labyrinth; <b>its</b> <b>dark</b> mood and somber message {{is similar to that}} of The Autumn of the Patriarch. Love is a theme common to both Love in the Time of Cholera and The General in His Labyrinth, but the latter is {{considered}} a tragedy. These two novels have been used to demonstrate the range of García Márquez's work.|$|E

5|$|The 2015 Fantastic Four {{film was}} the weakest {{reviewed}} of the series; it was criticised for <b>its</b> <b>dark,</b> humorless tone, its character arcs, designs (especially that of Dr. Doom), bland acting, and poorly written story. Josh Trank, {{who directed the}} film, was himself not satisfied, posting a message on Twitter stating he had a better version of the film, but was ruined by Fox; he later deleted the message.|$|E
5|$|The Costa Rican bolete Leccinum neotropicalis is {{a closely}} allied species. It is {{distinguished}} from L.rugosiceps by <b>its</b> <b>dark</b> brown to dark reddish-brown color, and flesh {{that does not}} stain with injury. L.viscosum, found in Belize, features a similar cap and scaber pigmentation on the stipe, and similar color changes in response to injury in {{the flesh of the}} cap and the apex of the stipe; unlike L.rugosiceps, however, it also stains at the stipe base, and the cap is sticky rather than dry.|$|E
5|$|The Irish {{version of}} FES is brewed with pale malt, 25 per cent flaked barley (for head {{retention}} and body) and 10 per cent roasted barley, {{the latter being}} what gives the beer <b>its</b> <b>dark</b> hue. It uses the bitter Galena, Nugget and Target hop varieties which have undergone an isomerized kettle extract process. There are about a third more hops than in Guinness Draught and the beer has 47 Bitterness Units. The beer is force carbonated.|$|E
50|$|Ulvaria is a genus {{of green}} algae {{in the family}} Monostromataceae. It is similar to Ulva, but rather than being two cells thick, it is only one, despite <b>its</b> <b>darker</b> colour.|$|R
50|$|The series {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics, with praise for <b>its</b> <b>darker</b> tone, writing, music, and acting. However, the series scored poor viewership figures for its broadcast on BBC One.|$|R

5|$|The film {{received}} generally positive reviews, with critics {{praising the}} ensemble cast, and each lead {{being singled out}} for their performances across reviews. The plot received a more mixed response; some reviewers felt that <b>its</b> <b>dark,</b> humorous premise was explored well, while others felt the jokes were racist, homophobic and misogynistic. A sequel, Horrible Bosses 2, was released on November 26, 2014.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} positive reviews by critics, {{with particular}} praise directed at <b>its</b> <b>dark</b> tone and violent nature. The game also received great controversy, {{due to the}} level of graphic violence in the game. It was banned in several countries, and implicated in a murder by the UK media, although this implication was later rejected by the police and courts. The game won several accolades, and spawned the sequel Manhunt 2 in 2007. As of March 2008, the series has collectively sold 1.7 million copies.|$|E
5|$|Collybia cookei is {{most likely}} to be {{confused}} with the two other members of Collybia, both of which are outwardly similar in appearance; distinguishing between the three typically requires excavating the stem base away from the moss or debris in which the stem is embedded. In the field, C.tuberosa may be distinguished from C.cookei by <b>its</b> <b>dark</b> brown sclerotia that somewhat resembles an appleseed. Using a microscope provides a more definitive way of distinguishing the two: the hyphae in the sclerotia of C.cookei are rounded, while those of C.tuberosa are elongated; this diagnostic character is apparent with both fresh and dried material of the two species. C.cirrhata does not produce sclerotia.|$|E
50|$|Overall, {{reception}} {{was positive}} for this EP which was praised for <b>its</b> <b>darker,</b> heavier tones {{compared to the}} band's previous sound - and for mixing punk, rock and dubstep in an original way.|$|R
50|$|Two {{subspecies}} {{are often}} recognised. C. l. lepidus is the form {{found in most}} of the bird's range. The subspecies C. l. insulindae occurs in Borneo and can be distinguished by <b>its</b> <b>darker</b> underparts.|$|R
25|$|Along with Gilliam's animations, Cleese's {{work with}} Graham Chapman {{provided}} Python with <b>its</b> <b>darkest</b> and angriest moments, {{and many of}} his characters display the seething suppressed rage that later characterised his portrayal of Basil Fawlty.|$|R
5|$|Davis led a septet at the concert; saxophonist Sonny Fortune, bassist Michael Henderson, and guitarist Pete Cosey {{were given}} space to improvise against a dense {{backdrop}} of riffs, electronic effects, cross-beats, and funk grooves from the rhythm section—drummer Al Foster, guitarist Reggie Lucas, and percussionist James Mtume. Davis controlled their rhythmic and musical direction with hand and head gestures, phrases played on his wah-wah processed trumpet, and drones from an accompanying electronic organ. The evolving {{nature of the}} performance led to the widespread misunderstanding {{that it had no}} compositional basis, while <b>its</b> <b>dark,</b> angry, and somber musical qualities were seen as a reflection of the musician's emotional and spiritual state at the time.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{director}} Martin Campbell {{confirmed the}} possibility of a Green Lantern trilogy. Warner Bros. originally planned on Green Lantern being the first entry of a new DC film franchise, and commissioned a script for a sequel from Greg Berlanti, Michael Green, and Marc Guggenheim while filming for the first film was underway. In August 2010, Michael Goldenberg was still attached to write the screenplay, based on the sequel treatment. The scene in the film's end credits showing a resurgence of the yellow power ring of fear, with Sinestro becoming corrupted by <b>its</b> <b>dark</b> power, teased the planned sequel. In September 2011 Warner Bros., dismayed by the film's negative reviews and disappointing box office return, abandoned plans for sequels.|$|E
5|$|Seasons {{begins as}} the Triforce {{calls out to}} Link from within Hyrule Castle. Link {{approaches}} it, and is transported to a dark forest where he encounters a traveling group led by a dancer named Din. After Din welcomes Link to Holodrum, the sky becomes covered in black clouds. A voice from the clouds calls Din the Oracle of Seasons and refers to himself as Onox, General of Darkness. A funnel cloud drops from the sky, taking Din into <b>its</b> <b>dark</b> heights. As the tornado dissipates, the seasons of Holodrum fall into disarray and change rapidly.|$|E

50|$|Besides the war, Sero Khanzadyan writes about, as {{has already}} been mentioned, Armenian history and {{specifically}} one of <b>its</b> <b>darkest</b> pages, the Armenian Genocide of 1915. One of his best novels “Six nights” is about that.|$|R
5|$|The {{thirteen}} episode series premiered in Japan on MBS on April 4, 2013 and {{was subsequently}} licensed by Sentai Filmworks in North America, Hanabee Entertainment in Australia and New Zealand and by MVM Entertainment in the United Kingdom for English home video releases. A manga adaptation was serialized in Monthly GFantasy between December 2012 and October 2014. A light novel prequel was also published by Kodansha Box. In addition, two supplementary books and three Drama CDs {{along with a}} host of other merchandise were released. Critics praised the series for <b>its</b> <b>dark</b> animation styles and backgrounds. However the majority of reviewers had mixed feelings towards the cast of characters since they felt that while the characters were either not appealing or developed enough, their deaths were impactful to the viewer.|$|E
5|$|A {{disappointed}} Uslan then wrote {{a script}} titled Return of the Batman {{to give the}} film industry {{a better idea of}} his vision for the film. Uslan later compared <b>its</b> <b>dark</b> tone to that of , which his script pre-dated by six years. In November 1979, producer Jon Peters and Casablanca FilmWorks, headed by Peter Guber, joined the project. The four producers felt it was best to pattern the film's development after that of Superman (1978). Uslan, Melniker and Guber pitched Batman to Universal Pictures, but the studio turned it down. The project was publicly announced with a budget of $15 million in July 1980 at the Comic Art Convention in New York. Casablanca FilmWorks was absorbed into PolyGram Pictures in 1980. Guber and Peters left PolyGram Pictures in 1982 and took the Batman film rights with them, although PolyGram would retain at least 7.5% of the profits of said rights due to a contractual agreement. Guber and Peters immediately set up shop at Warner Bros., which finally decided to accept Batman.|$|E
