5|$|After a {{successful}} junior career which culminated with selection in the under-18 All-Australian team, Harley was drafted to the Port Adelaide Football Club as a zone selection. Although an inaugural {{member of the}} club, Harley struggled to force <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> senior team and spent {{the majority of his}} early years playing for Norwood in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL). After making just one appearance for Port Adelaide, Harley was traded to the Geelong Football Club in exchange for the 37th draft pick in the 1998 AFL Draft.|$|E
5|$|Booth worked <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{company with}} a string of false claims about his influence, and finally became {{chairman}} of the Board of Directors by claiming that {{it was the only way}} to avoid Gruban being interned due to his German origin. As soon as this happened, he cut Gruban out of the company, leaving him destitute, and eventually arranged for him to be interned. Gruban successfully appealed against the internment, and brought Booth to court.|$|E
5|$|Following the Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Drljević began {{cooperating with the}} Italian authorities occupying Montenegro. In July, he proclaimed the reestablishment of the Kingdom of Montenegro, but his attempt to establish an Axis-aligned puppet state triggered an immediate uprising. That September, Italian authorities sent him to an internment camp in Italy after the oubreak of an anti-fascist revolt. Drljević escaped the camp several months later and made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> German-held half of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH). In the summer of 1944, he created the Montenegrin State Council in Zagreb.|$|E

5|$|When Cleomenes {{heard about}} the revolt at Argos, he sent his {{stepfather}} with 2,000 men to try and save the situation. Megistonous was killed while assaulting the city, however, and the relief force retreated, leaving the Spartans in the citadel to continue resistance. Cleomenes abandoned his much stronger position at the Isthmus {{for fear of being}} encircled and left Corinth to {{fall into the hands of}} Antigonus. Cleomenes advanced his troops upon Argos and forced <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> city, rescuing the men stuck in the citadel. He retreated to Mantinea when he saw Antigonus' army on the plain outside the city.|$|E

5|$|Yabuhara hires Hanada to kill four men, {{the first}} three being a customs officer, an ocularist and a {{jewellery}} dealer. Hanada snipes the first from behind a billboard's animatronic cigarette lighter, shoots the second from a basement up through a pipe drain when the latter leans over the sink and, ordered to finish quickly, blasts <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> third's office and escapes on an advertising balloon. Misako then appears at his door and offers him a nearly impossible contract to kill a foreigner, which he cannot refuse having just been told the plan.|$|E
5|$|After a {{slow start}} to the {{historic}} campaign, Loxton struck form midway through the English summer and forced <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> team {{for the last three}} Tests. He played a prominent role in the Fourth Test, scoring an aggressive and counterattacking 93 that helped Australia pry the initiative from England; the tourists eventually won the match. In 1949–50, Loxton cemented his position in the national team, playing in all five Tests in South Africa and scoring his only century at international level. He remained a regular member of the Test team until a form slump during the 1950–51 home season; he was dropped after three Tests against England and never played for Australia again. Loxton continued to play for Victoria in domestic competition until retiring {{at the end of the}} 1957–58 season.|$|E

Basilius, threatens and forces King Oswald into revealing the location of Commodus, who has been traded to the fearsome men north of Hadrian's Wall. Basilius orders Vitallion and Marius to retrieve him. After crossing the border into Caledonia, the party is ambushed, Vitallion is taken hostage by barbarians, and Marius is separated from his legion. Marius makes <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> enemy camp, freeing and rallying captured Roman soldiers along the way.

5|$|After scoring 66 {{times in}} 113 {{appearances}} for Basingstoke Town, McAllister {{moved to the}} Conference National outfit Stevenage Borough on a bosman transfer in May 2004. He debuted after being introduced as a 33rd-minute substitute in a 1–0 victory at home to Crawley Town on 16 October 2004. McAllister struggled to force <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> first-team, and was loaned to fellow Conference National club Gravesend & Northfleet on 14 December, debuting four days later in a 1–0 defeat away to Hereford United. He went on to score his first goal for Gravesend & Northfleet after just two minutes in a 1–1 draw away to Crawley Town on 26 December, and this was followed up with a goal in the following match, a 2–2 draw at home to Accrington Stanley. McAllister completed the loan spell with two goals from five appearances, before rejoining his former club Eastleigh on loan {{until the end of}} 2004–05.|$|E
5|$|Burgmeier {{made his}} debut on 23 August, in a 2–1 defeat to Gillingham at The Darlington Arena. He scored his first goal for Darlington in a 2–1 win against Port Vale on 13 September. Manager Dave Penney praised Burgmeier {{for the start}} he made to the club, both as a goal scorer and creator, which also helped him to play <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{affections}} of the club's supporters. When Burgmeier won his 49thcap for Liechtenstein against Wales, it was his fourth in the two months since he joined Darlington. It took him past the club record three caps of Canadian Jason de Vos and New Zealander Adrian Webster, with a coach-load of Darlington fans there to see him play at the Millennium Stadium. His next cap clashed with Darlington's FA Cup first round replay with Conference North-side Droylsden, {{in which they were}} defeated.|$|E
5|$|Germanicus' {{divisions}} met {{up to the}} north, and ravaged {{the countryside}} between the Ems and the Lippe, and penetrated to the Teutoburg Forest, a mountain forest in Western Germany situated between these two rivers. There, Germanicus {{and some of his}} men visited the site of the disastrous Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, and began burying the remains of the Roman soldiers that had been left in the open. After half a day of the work, he called off the burial of bones so that they could continue their war against the Germans. He made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> heartland of the Cherusci. At a location Tacitus calls the pontes longi ("long causeways"), in boggy lowlands somewhere near the Ems, Arminius' troops attacked the Romans. Arminius initially caught Germanicus' cavalry in a trap, inflicting minor casualties, but the Roman infantry reinforced the rout and checked them. The fighting lasted for two days, with neither side achieving a decisive victory. Germanicus' forces withdrew and returned to the Rhine.|$|E
25|$|Alderman {{was unable}} to force <b>his</b> <b>way</b> back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Australian side over the 1983-84 summer. Hoever 30 first class wickets at 25.26 saw him picked for the West Indies.|$|R

50|$|Although he {{had made}} 20 {{appearances}} in 1990, McKeown didn't play in Collingwood's semi final win and wasn't able to force <b>his</b> <b>way</b> back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> team for the grand final.|$|R
5|$|His {{basketball}} {{performance in}} high school was unimpressive. He came off the bench to average four points per game (ppg). His stepmother informed him that when he graduated high school he would be {{thrown out of the}} house. Chris had been able to leave home on a football scholarship and would later play in the National Football League, but Washington himself had nowhere to go. He trained for three hours a day {{toward the end of his}} senior season, and showed up uninvited at a playground game featuring top high school players from Washington and Pennsylvania, where he talked <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> game. Tom Young, who had recently left his job as an assistant coach at Maryland University to become head coach at American University, saw him play there, and although Washington did not perform particularly well, Young was impressed by his hustle and how he ignored the poor treatment he received from the people who organized the game.|$|E
5|$|Lace {{confessed to}} the murder on 17 September 1983. He gave a {{statement}} to police that he had stolen a rucksack and cash on 4December 1979 from the care home in Portsmouth {{where he had been}} living and then walked to Southampton. He was present {{at the rear of the}} Tom Tackle pub when DeSimone was dropped off by Savage, and then approached DeSimone when she got into her own vehicle. He first knocked on the window and asked the time but then forced <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> driver's seat beside her and locked the doors to prevent her escaping. Once inside he sexually assaulted her and strangled her using the passenger seatbelt in the car. He then took her handbag and jewellery, and hid for approximately 10minutes before heading to Southampton Central station and catching a train back to Portsmouth.|$|E
5|$|Raised in New South Wales, Brown {{initially}} {{struggled in}} both work and cricket, before gradually rising through the cricket ranks. He made his first-class debut for New South Wales in the 1932–33 season and forced <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> national side during the 1934 tour of England. When long-term openers Bill Ponsford and Bill Woodfull retired {{at the end}} of the tour, Brown and his state opening partner Fingleton took over. After poor form made his selection for the 1938 tour of England controversial, Brown responded with a total of 1,854 runs, including an unbeaten 206 that saved Australia from defeat in the second Test, and was honoured as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year.|$|E

50|$|He {{struggled}} in 2003, coming {{close to being}} delisted, but improved his form and cemented a spot during 2004, being a premiership player that year after working <b>his</b> <b>way</b> back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> side.|$|R
5|$|Sebastian Vettel was {{the next}} one of the front runners to pit, coming in on lap 13, while {{teammate}} Kimi Räikkönen followed a lap later. Rosberg made a pit stop on lap 15 and emerged behind Bottas, overtaking him two laps later. Meanwhile, Hamilton went into the pit lane for a tyre change on lap 16. By lap 18, Hamilton was leading Vettel by 8.1 seconds, with Rosberg a further 3.8 seconds behind. Max Verstappen entered the point scoring ranks with a pass on Fernando Alonso into turn one on lap 26. Two laps later, his Toro Rosso teammate Sainz damaged his front wing when hitting a bollard on <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pit lane, leading to a front wing change.|$|E
5|$|The return match saw Celta Vigo's Jesuli {{level the}} tie on {{aggregate}} after 24 minutes. Celtic rallied, and on 37 minutes John Hartson used his body strength to force <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Spanish penalty box and score {{with a powerful}} shot. Crucially, due to the away goals rule, Celta Viga now had to score twice to avoid losing the tie. Benni McCarthy scored {{early in the second}} half for Celta Vigo but, despite a glaring miss from Jesuli near the end, Celtic held on to win the tie on away goals. The 1–2 loss on the night was the first of two defeats for Celtic {{on the way to the}} final.|$|E
5|$|The sole Togolese canoeist, Benjamin Boukpeti {{competed in}} the men's K-1 competition.

He finished his second run in 101.93 seconds, placing him in 21st place. This gave him an overall total of 198.92 seconds, which put him in 15th place. Since the top 20 finishers qualified for the semi-final, Boukpeti made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> next round. There was a single run for the semi-final on 20 August, with Boukpeti's time of 102.42 seconds resulting in him finishing in 18th position out of the 20 canoeists. This was ahead of Pierpaolo Ferrazzi of Italy (103.07 seconds) and Switzerland's Michael Kurt (103.20 seconds). Only the top ten competitors qualified for the final, ending Boukpeti's competition.|$|E
