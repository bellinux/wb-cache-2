Virus isolation and nucleic acid <b>detection</b> are more accurate than antigen <b>detection,</b> but these tests are not widely available due to their greater cost. <b>Detection</b> of NS1 during the febrile phase of a primary infection may be greater than 90% sensitive however is only 60–80% in subsequent infections. All tests may be negative {{in the early stages of}} the disease. PCR and viral antigen <b>detection</b> are more accurate in the first seven days.

40|$|Aims. We {{calibrate}} {{the number}} density, completeness, reliability {{and the lower}} mass limit of galaxy-cluster <b>detections</b> through their thermal SZ signal, and compare them to X-ray cluster <b>detections.</b> Methods. We simulate maps of the thermal SZ effect and the X-ray emission from light cones constructed in a large, hydrodynamical, cosmological simulation volume, including realistic noise contributions. The maps are convolved with linear, optimised, single- and multi-band filters to identify local peaks and their signal-to-noise ratios. The resulting peak catalogues are then compared to the halo population in the simulation volume to identify true and spurious <b>detections.</b> Results. Multi-band filtering improves the statistics of SZ cluster <b>detections</b> considerably compared to single-band filtering. Observations with the characteristics of ACT detect clusters with masses M> 6 - 9 e 13 M_o/h, quite independent of redshift, reach 50 % completeness at ~ 1 e 14 M_o/h and 100 % completeness at ~ 2 e 14 M_o/h. Samples are contaminated by only a few per cent spurious <b>detections.</b> This is broadly comparable to X-ray cluster <b>detections</b> with XMM-Newton with 100 ks exposure time in the soft band, except that the mass limit for X-ray <b>detections</b> increases much more steeply with redshift than for SZ <b>detections.</b> A comparison of true and filtered signals in the SZ and X-ray maps confirms that the filters introduce at most a negligible bias.
