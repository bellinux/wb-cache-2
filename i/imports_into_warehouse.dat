Data quality tools aim at detecting and correcting data {{problems that}} affect the accuracy and efficiency of data analysis applications. Source data <b>imported</b> <b>into</b> the data <b>warehouse</b> often has different quality, format, coding etc. In order to bring all the data together in a standard, homogeneous environment, Extraction–transformation– loading (ETL) tools are used. ETL solutions provided so far are either proprietary and have limited functionality. Small and Medium Scale Enterprises(SME) and Small Scale Enterprises (SSE) cannot afford the licensing cost of these paid tools. The developed tool is capable of providing an integrated and open source data quality solution- MaSSEETL is to deal with naming conflicts, structural conflicts, date conversions, missing values and changing dimensions. MaSSEETL solves the appropriate errors with appropriate level of warning. In this paper, we are presenting the working of MaSSEETL. The tool provides an pragmatic evidence of strategic intensification of quality data in the academic and business enterprises...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{photosynthetic}} proteins RuBiSCO, ferredoxin I and ferredoxin NADP+-oxidoreductase (pFNR) were efficiently <b>imported</b> <b>into</b> isolated pea chloroplasts but {{not into}} pea root plastids. By contrast non-photosynthetic ferredoxin III and heterotrophic FNR (hFNR) were efficiently <b>imported</b> <b>into</b> both isolated chloroplasts and root plastids. Chimeric ferredoxin I/III (transit peptide of ferredoxin I {{attached to the}} mature region of ferredoxin III) only <b>imported</b> <b>into</b> chloroplasts. Ferredoxin III/I (transit peptide of ferredoxin III attached to the mature region of ferredoxin I) <b>imported</b> <b>into</b> both chloroplasts and root plastids. This suggests that import depends on specific interactions between the transit peptide and the translocon apparatus...|$|R

40|$|AbstractUsing {{in vitro}} <b>import</b> assays <b>into</b> {{purified}} mitochondria and chloroplasts {{we found that}} Arabidopsis ferrochelatase-I and ferrochelatase-II were not <b>imported</b> <b>into</b> mitochondria purified from Arabidopsis (or several other plants) but were <b>imported</b> <b>into</b> pea leaf chloroplasts. Other dual targeted proteins could be <b>imported</b> <b>into</b> purified mitochondria from Arabidopsis. As only two ferrochelatase genes {{are present in the}} completed Arabidopsis genome, the presence of ferrochelatase activity in plant mitochondria needs to be re-evaluated. Previous reports of Arabidopsis ferrochelatase-I <b>import</b> <b>into</b> pea mitochondria are {{due to the fact that}} pea leaf (and root) mitochondria appear to import a variety, but not all chloroplast proteins. Thus pea mitochondria are not a suitable system to either study dual targeting, or to distinguish between isozymes present in mitochondria and chloroplasts...|$|R

40|$|Treatment of {{isolated}} yeast mitochondria {{with high levels}} (1 mg/ml) of trypsin severely inhibits protein import but does not destroy {{the integrity of the}} outer membrane or abolish mitochondrial energy coupling. If the outer membrane of these trypsin-inactivated mitochondria is disrupted by osmotic shock, the resulting mitoplasts are again able to import proteins. Protein <b>import</b> <b>into</b> mitoplasts, like that into intact mitochondria, is energy-dependent; however, whereas <b>import</b> <b>into</b> mitochondria is inhibited by antibody against 45 -kd proteins of the outer membrane [Ohba and Schatz, EMBO J., 6, 2109 - 2115 (1987) ], <b>import</b> <b>into</b> mitoplasts not affected by this antibody.

40|$|ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Maize {{is a major}} crop plant, {{grown for}} human and animal nutrition, {{as well as a}} {{renewable}} resource forbioenergy. When looking at the problems of limited fossil fuels, the growth of the world's population or theworld's climate change, it is important to find ways to increase the yield and biomass of maize and to studyhow it reacts to specific abiotic and biotic stress situations. Within the OPTIMAS systems biology projectmaize plants were grown under a large set of controlled stress conditions, phenotypically characterised andplant material was harvested to analyse the effect of specific environmental conditions or developmentalstages. Transcriptomic, metabolomic, ionomic and proteomic parameters were measured from the same plantmaterial allowing the comparison of results across different omics domains. A data warehouse wasDescriptionThe OPTIMAS Data Warehouse (OPTIMAS-DW) is a comprehensive data collection for maize and integratesdata from different data domains such as transcriptomics, metabolomics, ionomics, proteomics andphenomics. Within the OPTIMAS project, a 44 K oligo chip was designed and annotated to describe thefunctions of the selected unigenes. Several treatment- and plant growth stage experiments were performed andmeasured data were filled into data templates and <b>imported</b> <b>into</b> the data <b>warehouse</b> by a Java based importtool. A web interface allows users to browse through all stored experiment data in OPTIMAS-DW includingall data domains. Furthermore, the user can filter the data to extract information of particular interest. All datacan be exported into different file formats for further data analysis and visualisation. The data analysisintegrates data from different data domains and enables the user to find answers to different systems biologyquestions. Finally, maize specific pathway information is provided. CONCLUSIONS: With OPTIMAS-DW a data warehouse for maize was established, which is able to handle different datadomains, comprises several analysis results that will support researchers within their work and supportssystems biological research in particular.

The gene, POX 4, {{encoding}} acyl-CoA oxidase was expressed in vitro, and the resulting polypeptide was <b>imported</b> <b>into</b> purified peroxisomes in a temperature-dependent fashion.

We identified two regions of acyl-CoA oxidase (amino acids 1 - 118 and 309 - 427) that contained information that specifically targeted fragments of acyl-CoA oxidase to peroxisomes. The corresponding regions of the gene were fused to cDNA encoding the cytosolic enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and the expressed fusion proteins were likewise <b>imported</b> <b>into</b> peroxisomes.
