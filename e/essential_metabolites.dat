This steroid is closely related to, or is identical with, either,&sitosterol or y-sitosterol. Paramecium aurelia has been established in pure culture in a heat-sterilized medium, composed of equal parts of a 0. 5 yo yeast autolysate (Basamin-Busch) and a 24 hr. culture of Aerobacter aerogems in lettuce extract (van Wagtendonk & Hackett, 1949). Lettuce or other plant extracts were shown to be essential since no growth of P. aurelia could be obtained when these extracts were omitted.

40|$|Symbiosis {{has been}} among the most {{important}} evolutionary steps to generate biological complexity. The establishment of symbiosis required an intimate metabolic link between biological systems with different complexity levels. The strict endo- cellular symbiotic bacteria of insects are beautiful examples of the metabolic coupling between organisms belonging to different kingdoms, a eukaryote and a prokaryote. The host (eukaryote) provides the endosymbiont (prokaryote) with a stable cellular environment while the endosymbiont supplements the host 2 ̆ 7 s diet with <b>essential</b> <b>metabolites.</b> For such communication to take place, endosymbionts 2 ̆ 7 genomes have suffered dramatic modifications and reconfigurations of proteins 2 ̆ 7 functions. Two of the main modifications, loss of genes redundant for endosymbiotic bacteria or the host and bacterial genome streamlining, have been extensively studied. However, no studies have accounted for possible functional shifts in the endosymbiotic proteomes. Here, we develop a simple method to screen genomes for evidence of functional divergence between two species clusters, and we apply it to identify functional shifts in the endosymbiotic proteomes. Despite the strong effects of genetic drift in the endosymbiotic systems, we unexpectedly identified genes to be under stronger selective constraints in endosymbionts of aphids and ants than in their free-living bacterial relatives. These genes are directly involved in supplementing the host 2 ̆ 7 s diet with <b>essential</b> <b>metabolites.</b> A test of functional divergence supports a strong relationship between the endosymbiosis and the functional shifts of proteins involved in the metabolic communication with the insect host.

Enzyme inhibition is often driven by <b>essential</b> <b>metabolites,</b> affects the majority of biochemical processes, and is executed by a structured network whose topological organization is reflecting chemical similarities that exist between metabolites.
