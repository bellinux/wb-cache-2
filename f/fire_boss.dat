2500|$|Two [...] holes were drilled {{from the}} surface into areas where the miners were {{believed}} to be; microphones and video cameras lowered into them for ten-minute periods {{did not find any}} signs of life. Air quality tests performed through the first hole on the morning of January 3 indicated that carbon monoxide (CO) levels {{in that part of the}} mine were at 1,300 parts per million. Officials called this [...] "very discouraging." [...] A third hole encountered groundwater and could not be drilled all the way down. However, the miners were trained to find a safe part of the mine and barricade themselves into it in the event of an explosion or collapse. Experts expected that a third hole, if successful, could expand the opening and provide a better way of rescuing the miners than proceeding into the mine. Miners are required to carry a SCSR that provides a one-hour supply of oxygen for evacuation. The first hint of the miners' status came around 5:00p.m. on January 3 when it was reported that a body had been found. Because of the location of the body, those familiar with the miners and their jobs believed it was the <b>fire</b> <b>boss,</b> Terry Helms. Hours later, just before midnight, rumors spread quickly that 12 of the 13 miners had been found alive. Thirty minutes later, the rescue team told company officials that the original report was incorrect.|$|E

50|$|The C-47/DC-3, {{registration}} number NC24320, {{was the only}} smokejumper plane available at Hale Field, near the current location of Sentinel High School, on August 5, 1949, when the call came in seeking 25 smokejumpers to fight a blaze in a hard-to-reach area of the Helena National Forest. The C-47/DC-3 could only hold 16 jumpers and their equipment. Even though more help was needed, <b>fire</b> <b>bosses</b> decided not {{to wait for a}} second plane, and instead sent No. NC24320 out on its own. NC24320 flew with Johnson Flying Service from Hale Field in Missoula, Montana and was used to drop Smokejumpers as well as for other operations for which Johnson Flying Service held contracts. The C-47/DC-3 that carried the smokejumpers that day is on exhibit in Missoula at the Museum of Mountain Flying.

The <b>fire</b> <b>boss</b> responded by threatening Goodwin with arrest and then ordered him escorted from the scene. The following day, Goodwin approached the fire chief of a Fire Department sub-station and presented his rescue plan. The fire chief told Goodwin he needed to climb a building to learn of the dangers of high-rise firefighting and rescue.
