A cannon captures as in xiangqi: it moves any distance along a single row or column of the board, jumping over exactly one <b>intermediate</b> <b>piece</b> (called a screen). Any other squares between the cannon and its target must be empty. The color of the screening piece does not matter; it may be friend or foe, or even face down.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop and apply an {{experimental}} grading system to sonatas written by American-born composers from 1950 to 1975. Although several authors have addressed the problem of grading or classifying piano music, there are generally no precise criteria provided to substantiate the validity of their systems. The present author discovered some significant and innovative yet generally neglected piano sonatas. The grading system in this research was based on the physiological factors effecting the pianist's development. These factors include: 1) Equality of Fingers (finger independence and mobility); 2) Passage of the Thumb (scales and arpeggios); 3) Double-Note and Polyphonic Playing; 4) Extensions (stretches between the fingers); and 5) Arm Rotation (execution of chords and octaves). In addition, since factors such as retuning of the instrument., polyrhythms, and improvisation can make a moderate or <b>intermediate</b> <b>piece</b> into a difficult one, a Special Problem category was added. Each of the six physiological divisions are assigned a numerical. difficulty level from one to ten. The divisions are then averaged and assigned a final "grade" as follows:Easy 1 (E- 1) = 1. 0 - 1. 9; Easy 2 (E [...] 2) = 2. 0 - 2. 9; Moderate 1 (M- 1) [...] 3. 0 [...] 3. 9; Moderate 2 (M- 2) = 4. 0 - 4. 9; Intermediate 1 (I- 1) = 5. 0 [...] 5. 9; Intermediate 2 (I- 2) = 6. 0 - 6. 9; Difficult. 1 (D- 1) = 7. 0 [...] 7. 9; Difficult 2 (D- 2) = 8. 0 - 8. 9; Virtuoso (V) = 9. 0. Eighty [...] six sonatas were reviewed and graded. These compositions represent a broad selection of works of various degrees of difficulty. By knowing the student's abilities and needs, the piano instructor may use this study to select sonatas that correspond to the appropriate level of attainment. Of the works reviewed, the majority fall into the Moderate category. This was not an unusual finding in that certain pianistic development is required before being able to play the scores. The grading system differs from previous systems in that it provides criteria for the placement of the works into a difficulty rating based on the physiological factors affecting the pianist's development.

50|$|Cogs were a type {{of round}} ship, {{characterized}} by a flush-laid flat bottom at midships but gradually shifted to overlapped strakes near the posts. They had full lapstrake planking covering the sides, generally starting from the bilge strakes, and double-clenched iron nails for plank fastenings. The keel, or keelplank, was only slightly thicker than the adjacent garboards and had no rabbet. Both stem and stern posts were straight and rather long, and connected to the keelplank through <b>intermediate</b> <b>pieces</b> called hooks. The lower plank hoods terminated in rabbets in the hooks and posts, but upper hoods were nailed to the exterior faces of the posts. Caulking was generally tarred moss that was inserted into curved grooves, covered with wooden laths, and secured by metal staples called sintels. Finally, the cog-built structure could not be completed without a stern-mounted hanging central rudder, which was a unique northern development. Cogs used to have open hulls and could be rowed short distances. In the 13th century they received decks.|$|R

Several aspects and techniques of sight-reading are addressed within a collective frame of mind in which the students can profit from that special setting. The first section of this paper focuses on ethical considerations regarding Class Piano, assets and liabilities of such a setting, the necessity of such a method, as well as other secondary topics. The method itself is divided into four sections: the first addresses only rhythmic reading and the second focus on pieces employing the five-finger position only. The third section is comprised of <b>intermediate</b> <b>pieces</b> and the fourth is more comprehensive, including such important auxiliary skills as guitar chord symbol reading, the creation of accompaniment patterns and improvisation.

The sideband separation is achieved using a quadrature scheme, where two separate DSB mixer blocks are combined with an intermediate waveguide component containing the LO waveguide distribution circuitry and RF waveguide hybrid. The <b>intermediate</b> waveguide <b>piece</b> is fabricated by using copper micromachining, which gives dimensions’ accuracy better than 1 μm. The RF signal coming from the waveguide hybrid is coupled to the SIS junctions through an E-probe with integrated bias-T. We implemented an on-chip LO injection solution, where the LO coupler is integrated onto the mixer chip and fabricated together with the SIS junction and the tuning circuitry. The on-chip LO coupler is made as a combination of superconducting microstrip lines and slot-lines (branches), which gives almost a lossless solution. With the fabrication accuracy better than 0. 5 μm by using optical lithography, the circuitry is proven to give a good performance following the simulations expectations...|$|R
40|$|In a {{temperature-sensitive mutant}} of E. coli {{defective}} in tRNA biosynthesis, many tRNA precursors, including monomeric and multimeric forms, accumulate.

These large precursors were cleaved by cell extracts first into <b>intermediate</b> size <b>pieces</b> which were subsequently processed by RNase P. On the basis of heat stability of mutant cell extracts, the endonuclease responsible for the initial cleavage appears to be distinct from RNase P and is designated RNase O. One of the monomeric precursors was shown to be processed first by RNase P and the product subsequently cleaved further into a smaller molecule. The nuclease responsible for this second cleavage {{also appears to be}} distinct from RNase P and is designated RNase Q.

40|$|The {{technique}} of flattening nested data parallelism combines all the independent operations in nested apply-to-all constructs and generates {{large amounts of}} potential parallelism for both regular and irregular expressions. However, the resulting data-parallel programs can have enormous memory requirements, limiting their utility. In this paper, we present piecewise execution, an automatic method of partially serializing data-parallel programs so that they achieve maximum parallelism within storage limitations. By computing large <b>intermediate</b> sequences in <b>pieces,</b> our approach requires asymptotically less memory to perform {{the same amount of}} work. By using characteristics of the underlying parallel architecture to drive the computation size, we retain effective use of a parallel machine at each step. This dramatically expands the class of nested data-parallel programs that can be executed using the flattening technique.

40|$|Cold formed thin plated elements, {{often with}} typical Z or  cross section shape, serve as basic {{component}} to construct standard industrial halls, Figure 1. Their advantages are multifold: an economic construction is obtained since the proper {{weight of the}} structure is limited and thus also the steel consumption and transport towards the construction area. Construction is simple since easy to handle subcomponents are used that does not require heavy cranes. Because columns and beams consist of several subcomponents with basic class 4 Z or -members and <b>intermediate</b> connection <b>pieces</b> bolted together, their behavior will differ from traditional H-sections. In addition, the use of profiled wall and roof sheeting results in additional strength and stiffness.
