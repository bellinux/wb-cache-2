Controls {{on the use of}} consumed fossil fuels and the reduction of emission gases are essential for the reduction of CO 2 in the construction area as one reduces the second and third curing to emit CO 2 in the construction materials industry. In this study, a new curing method was addressed by using a low <b>energy</b> <b>curing</b> admixture (LA) in order to exclude autoclave curing. The new curing method was applied to make panels. Then, its physical properties, depending on the mixed amount of fiber, type of fiber and mixed ratio of fiber, were observed. The type of fiber {{did not appear to be}} a main factor that affected strength, while the LA mixing ratio and mixing amount of fiber appeared to be major factors affecting the strength. Applying the proposed new curing method can reduce carbon and restrain the use of fossil fuels through a reduction of the second and third curing processes, which emit CO 2 in the construction materials industry. Therefore, it will be helpful to reduce global warming...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a joint Westinghouse Hanford Company (Westinghouse Hanford) -Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL) study that considered the feasibility of treating radioactive waste before disposal to reduce the inventory of long-lived radionuclides, making the waste more suitable for geologic disposal. The treatment considered here is one in which waste would be chemically separated so that long-lived radionuclides can be treated using specific processes appropriate for the nuclide. The technical feasibility of enhancing repository performance by this type of treatment is considered in this report. A joint Westinghouse Hanford-PNL study group developed a concept called the Clean Use of Reactor <b>Energy</b> (<b>CURE),</b> and evaluated the potential of current technology to reduce the long-lived radionuclide content in waste from the nuclear power industry. The CURE process consists of three components: chemical separation of elements that have significant quantities of long-lived radioisotopes in the waste, exposure in a neutron flux to transmute the radioisotopes to stable nuclides, and packaging of radionuclides that cannot be transmuted easily for storage or geologic disposal. 76 refs., 32 figs., 24 tabs...|$|R

40|$|The {{desire for}} high {{performance}} photonic components is often {{at odds with}} manufacturing process limitations and selection of compatible adhesive materials used in the fiber bonding process. Use of high performance adhesives, while desirable, typically requires longer curing times and higher temperature cure conditions to obtain the best results. Along with selection issues, low yields and reliability concerns are often attributed to adhesive performance and/or the process of curing the adhesive during assembly. Movement during post cure of adhesive joints leads to yield loss. Furthermore, reliability failures are reported highest during temperature cycling, due to improper bonding at the fiber interface. This paper {{provides an overview of}} application trials and dedicated development of a rapid curing technique that offers controlled, selective heating of the bond line.
