Based on radiation attenuation, the study involved the measurement of the thickness in centimeters scales for a flat sheets of Alumina ceramic, borated glass, aluminum and iron. The practicality of using the system to detect thickness flaws in millimeter range was calculated considering a scenario that a thickness change by 1 mm is present along the sheet of each sample. This is done through the assessment of the degree of transmitted attenuation experienced by a beam of high energy ionizing radiation, such as 241 Am directed perpendicular to the planar surface of the material.

40|$|AbstractTwin-roll casting (TRC) process {{combines}} casting and {{hot rolling}} {{into a single}} step, having an advantage of one-step processing of <b>flat</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>products.</b> Besides being such a cost-effective process, TRC also has a beneficial effect on microstructure such as reducing segregation, improving inclusion size distribution, refining microstructural and textural homogeneity. However, conventional equal speed rolling (ESR) of TRC magnesium alloy strip preserves a strong basal texture as often found in the rolling of conventional cast ingot (IC). The ductility of magnesium alloys is strongly affected by the texture. Thus, {{it is important to}} control the texture during processing for improvement of ductility at room temperature during sequential processing. Recently {{it has been reported that}} differential speed rolling (DSR) is effective for improving tensile elongation and formability of magnesium alloys by reducing the intensity of basal texture. Thus, it is of great interest to combine TRC and DSR technique for more efficient production of magnesium alloy sheet with improved ductility.

40|$|Development of wrought Mg alloys, {{particularly}} in sheet form, {{is essential to}} support the growing interest for lightweight components in the automotive industry. However, development of Mg alloy sheets has been quite slow due {{to the complexity of}} sheet production originated from limited deformability of Mg. In this respect, twin-roll strip casting, a one-step processing of <b>flat</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>products,</b> can be an alternative for the production of Mg alloy sheets. In this study, AZ 31 and experimental ZM series alloys are twin-roll strip cast into 2 mm thick sheets. The microstructure of the as-cast AZ 31 alloy sheet consists of columnar zones near the roll side and equiaxed zones in the mid-thickness region. On the other hand, as-cast ZM series alloy sheets show equiaxed dendritic structure through the thickness of sheet. These alloys were subjected to various thermo-mechanical treatments and their tensile properties were evaluated. Twin-roll strip cast AZ 31 alloy in H 24 condition has equivalent yield and tensile strengths with similar ductility compared to commercial ingot cast AZ 31 -H 24 alloy, indicating that twin-roll strip casting is a viable process for the fabrication of Mg alloy sheets. The experimental ZM series alloys have a large volume fraction of fine dispersoid particles in the microstructure, resulting from the beneficial effect of twin-roll strip casting on microstructural refinement. It has been shown that the experimental ZM series alloys have superior tensile properties compared to commercial ingot cast AZ 31 -H 24 alloy, suggesting the possibility of the development of new wrought Mg alloy sheets by twin-roll strip casting. open 7...|$|R

40|$|This paper models {{linkages}} between {{upstream and downstream}} goods in the U. S. market for flat-rolled steel. These vertical linkages are important to account for when estimating the impact of trade restrictions on imports of <b>flat</b> <b>rolled</b> steel because some types of <b>flat</b> <b>rolled</b> steel are predominately used to produce other types of <b>flat</b> <b>rolled</b> steel {{and in some cases}} also make up a large share of their production costs.

Drawing upon this literature, this paper builds a vertically linked version of the CES COMPAS model that incorporates vertical linkages as constant cross price elasticities in both downstream supply functions and upstream factor demand functions. Compared to estimates from the CES COMPAS without vertical linkages, introduction of a trade restriction increases demand for upstream goods and decreases supply of downstream goods, increasing prices of both upstream and downstream goods, while increasing shipments of upstream goods and decreasing shipments of downstream goods. In estimating the impact of the safeguard measures imposed on the <b>flat</b> <b>rolled</b> steel market, accounting for the vertical linkages is most important when estimating the impact on domestically produced slab since all downstream products produced from slab were subject to the safeguard tariffs.

40|$|The {{high quality}} {{requirements}} of sheet metal (eg steel, aluminium) {{and the modern}} trends towards computer control of sheet rolling have placed an increasing emphasis on {{a thorough understanding of}} the physics of the flat rolling process. The examination of the thermal behaviour of the <b>rolls</b> and <b>rolled</b> <b>product,</b> as the latter is deformed in a rolling stand, is integral to an understanding of rolling. The thermal process occurring in the rolling stands affects the mechanical and metallurgical properties of the material, governs the roll cooling requirements, and influences the overall flatness of the <b>rolled</b> <b>product.</b> This thesis is primarily concerned with the prediction of the short-time variation of the temperature field of the <b>rolls</b> and <b>rolled</b> <b>product,</b> as the latter is deformed in a rolling stand. The effect of an oxide layer, which often exists in hot rolling of steel, on the thermal process has been studied in detail. It is demonstrated that, under normal rolling conditions, the thermal process occurring in rolling can be reduced by perturbation methods to one of heat transfer between three slabs with plane parallel boundary contact. As a result, the reduction in heat loss to the rolls and the increase in temperature of the <b>rolled</b> <b>product</b> due to the insulating effect of the oxide layer can be quantified. The contribution of each heat source term, namely, that arising from the effect of the bulk temperature difference between the <b>roll</b> and <b>rolled</b> <b>product,</b> frictional heating at the roll/rolled product contact region, and deformation heating in the <b>rolled</b> <b>product</b> within the <b>roll</b> gap, to the overall thermal process is estimated for both hot and cold rolling conditions...|$|R

40|$|Rolling load for a 17 pass, 125 x 125 mm carbon {{manganese}} steel billet hot {{rolled to a}} 16 mm diameter rod was simulated. Load calculations were obtained using the temperature values for rod rolling obtained by the “Phantom Roll” method. Investigations were carried out for four different starting mean rolling temperatures between 900 - 1200 oC, and four different rolling strain rates of 0. 8, 0. 4, 1. 2, and 1. 6 s- 1. Results obtained showed that for all cases, rolling in grooved rolls required more power (higher load) compared to rolling in <b>flat</b> <b>rolls.</b> Loads were higher for lower rolling temperatures for both <b>flat</b> <b>rolls</b> or grooved rolls. An increase in rolling speed also corresponded {{to an increase in}} load for both grooved and <b>flat</b> <b>rolls.</b> Straight-line equations fitted load against log 10 Z (where Z is Zener-Hollomon’s Parameter) at temperatures of 988 oC, 1094 oC, and 1095 oC while two straight lines fitted the highest temperature of 1191 oC in checking the combined effect of temperature and strain rate on load. This abnormal behavior is probably due to strain localization in two distinct zones caused by re-crystallization and incomplete recovery during working at the highest temperature of 1191 oC.
