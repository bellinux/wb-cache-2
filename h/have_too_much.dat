5|$|After 7.Nc3 Black has the zwischenzug 7...Qh4+ 8.g3 Bxc3+ 9.bxc3 Qe7 so {{that the}} {{diagonal}} a8–h1 is weakened before Black develops the Bc8 to the b7-square. The queen on the e7-square is well placed to pressure the e4-pawn. However, as most of Black's pieces are on the queenside, continuing with pawn pushes like f7–f5 is probably too weakening, as Alekhine demonstrated in his game against Seitz in 1925. So Black does best to attack with pieces, possibly with the setup b6/Nc5/Bb7/0-0-0. In that case Tseitlin considers that with a knight on c5 the move d7–d6 should be avoided if Black has {{to respond to the}} capture Bxc5 by dxc5, because the white pawns in e4 and f4 would <b>have</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> leeway.|$|E

25|$|The majestic Stalinallee in Berlin, also {{completed}} in 1961, was conceived in 1952, and didn't <b>have</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> to lose: {{the scale and}} bulk of these buildings are definitely Stalinist, but the modest finishes are similar to Jugendstil and Prussian Neoclassicism. The street would later be extended in an International Style idiom and renamed Karl-Marx-Allee.|$|E

25|$|Also in the {{expedition}} was microbiologist Dr Lori Johnston, who placed samples on Britannic {{to look at}} the colonies of iron-eating bacteria on the wreck, which are responsible for the rusticles growing on Titanic. The results showed that even after 87 years {{on the bottom of the}} Kea Channel, Britannic is in much better condition than Titanic because the bacteria on her hull <b>have</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> competition and are actually helping protect the wreck by turning it into a man-made reef.|$|E

25|$|Yuan Shao reorganized {{his forces}} and sent Liu Bei with an army {{to support the}} rebellions against Cao Cao in Yinjiang (㶏疆; {{southwest}} of present-day Xuchang), just 20 li south of the capital. Cao Cao became concerned about such developments in his rear, but his cousin Cao Ren observed that Liu Bei could not <b>have</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> control over his new men given by Yuan Shao. So Cao Cao sent Cao Ren {{to deal with the}} rebellion. Cao Ren succeeded, killing the rebel leader Liu Pi and routing Liu Bei. Yuan Shao also tried to cut off Cao Cao from the west by sending Han Meng (韓猛) southwest. Cao Ren again responded to the threat by defeating Han Meng at Mount Jiluo (雞洛山; 50 li northeast of present-day Xinmi, Henan). Yuan Shao did not send any detached force into Cao Cao's territory after this.|$|E
25|$|One study {{compared}} {{patients with}} ingrown toenails to healthy controls {{and found no}} difference in the shape of toenails between those of patients and of the control group. The study suggested that treatment should not be based on the correction of a non-existent nail deformity. Ingrown toenails are caused by weight-bearing (activities such as walking, running, etc.) in patients that <b>have</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> soft skin tissue on the sides of their nail. Weight bearing causes this excessive amount of skin to bulge up along the sides of the nail. The pressure on the skin around the nail results in the tissue being damaged, resulting in swelling, redness and infection. Many treatments are directed at the nail itself and often include partial or full removal of the healthy nail. However, failure to treat the cutaneous condition can result in a return of the ingrowth and a deformity or mutilation of the nail.|$|E

500|$|In the Japanese {{version of}} the series, Kira is voiced by Sōichirō Hoshi. For the English dub, he is voiced by Matt Hill, who got the role thanks to a friend from the dub's director, who told Hill not to <b>have</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> energy when doing the voice. The line [...] "Kira Yamato! Launching!" [...] was {{repeated}} by Hill several times when obtaining the role. Hill remembers enjoying his work, having taken a liking to the character.|$|E

[...] Randee Dawn of The Hollywood Reporter reported that [...] "Hell-O" [...] had a [...] "stagy quality", and was [...] "not an episode that would have sold the series early on". Dawn felt that {{there were too many}} musical performances, commenting: [...] "They might be fun performances, but they're not all necessary, and yes, it is possible to <b>have</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> music even on a successful narrative musical TV series." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike the {{majority}} of his contemporaries, Simpson was open about the use of drugs in professional cycling. In 1960, interviewed by Chris Brasher for The Observer newspaper, Simpson spoke about his understanding of how riders could beat him, saying: [...] "I know from the way they ride the next day they are taking dope. I don't want to have to take it– I <b>have</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> respect for my body." [...] Two years before his death, Simpson hinted in the newspaper, The People, at drug-taking in races, although he implied that he himself was not involved. Asked about drugs by Eamonn Andrews on the BBC Home Service radio network, Simpson did not deny taking them; however, he said that a rider who frequently took drugs might get to the top but would not stay there.|$|E
