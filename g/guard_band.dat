500|$|The {{first volume}} {{production}} of mechanical filters was undertaken by Collins Radio Company {{starting in the}} 1950s. These were originally designed for telephone frequency-division multiplex applications where there is commercial advantage in using high quality filters. Precision and steepness of the transition band leads to a reduced width of <b>guard</b> <b>band,</b> which in turn leads {{to the ability to}} squeeze more telephone channels into the same cable. [...] This same feature is useful in radio transmitters for much the same reason. [...] Mechanical filters quickly also found popularity in VHF/UHF radio intermediate frequency (IF) stages of the high end radio sets (military, marine, amateur radio and the like) manufactured by Collins. [...] They were favoured in the radio application because they could achieve much higher Q-factors than the equivalent LC filter. [...] High Q allows filters to be designed which have high selectivity, important for distinguishing adjacent radio channels in receivers. [...] They also had an advantage in stability over both LC filters and monolithic crystal filters. The most popular design for radio applications was torsional resonators because radio IF typically lies in the 100 to 500kHz band.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cassette}} {{was a great}} {{step forward}} in convenience from reel-to-reel audio tape recording, although, because {{of the limitations of}} the cassette's size and speed, it initially compared poorly in quality. Unlike the 4-track stereo open-reel format, the two stereo tracks of each side lie adjacent to each other, rather than being interleaved with the tracks of the other side. This permitted monaural cassette players to play stereo recordings [...] "summed" [...] as mono tracks and permitted stereo players to play mono recordings through both speakers. The tape is [...] wide, with each stereo track 0.6mm wide and an unrecorded <b>guard</b> <b>band</b> between each track. The tape moves at [...] (1⅞ inch/s) from left to right. For comparison, the typical open-reel format in consumer use was [...] (¼ inch) wide, each stereo track nominally 1.0mm (1⁄25 inch) wide, and running at either twice or four times the speed of a cassette.|$|E

He left in early 1874. He travelled through populous parts of British-inhabited parts of Canada, playing as a cornet soloist within a military band. Patrick Gilmore heard of Liberati and asked him to be a special soloist for his Peace Jubilee the same year. Soon he became director and cornet soloist of all Canadian Artillery Bands. In 1875, he was asked to be the director of the Michigan National <b>Guard</b> <b>Band</b> and Detroit's police bugle band.|$|E

2500|$|After the {{battleship}} USS Maine exploded at Havana, Cuba in February 1898, a [...] "war fever" [...] against Spain swept through America with the cry: [...] "Remember the Maine!" [...] On March 4, 1898, a highly charged war rally {{was held at}} the Avilla Methodist Church. Three attorneys gave rousing speeches to the packed house, fueled with patriotic songs from a ladies choir. As a result, fifty-three young men immediately volunteered for military service in a new company that would be known as the Avilla Zouaves. These units were characterized by colorful uniforms and/or precision drilling patterned after the French Zouaves, and were very stylish in the 19th century military. The Avilla youth would be designated in the US Army as Company G, 5th Missouri Infantry Regiment. Two months later, the new Avilla unit was escorted by flag-bearing GAR members to the Carthage Train Depot, and with music from the Light <b>Guard</b> <b>Band</b> were ceremoniously sent off for battle in the Spanish–American War. The fighting in Cuba was over quickly and the 5th Missouri Infantry was mustered out on November 9, 1898, before the Avilla Zouaves saw any action. Although they did not fight in the war, this event illustrates the raw patriotic spirit of Avilla, Missouri still present in 1898.|$|E
2500|$|In the Apuseni {{region of}} Transylvania, {{the most active}} group was led by Leon Șușman. The group mainly hid {{in the woods and}} {{acquired}} part of its armament from a Iron <b>Guard</b> <b>band</b> that the Germans parachuted in the area in 1944-45. To eliminate this resistance group, the Securitate used informers against them and intercepted the correspondence of family members. An armed group called [...] "The National Defense Front-The Haduc Corps" [...] was headed by a former officer of the Royal Army who participated in the war against the Soviet Union on the Eastern Front, Major Nicolae Dabija. Resistants from this group robbed the Tax Office in Teiuș, armed with a rifle and handguns. The Securitate learned about the location of this group after an arrested resistant revealed their location on Muntele Mare and about their strength. An operation conducted by the Securitate forces decided to attack the rebels on the morning of March 4, 1949. Securitate forces led by Colonel Mihai Patriciu charged the peak where the rebels were located, with a gunfight and later hand-to-hand combat occurring. The Securitate suffered three deaths and three others wounded. Dabija was arrested on March 22, 1949 after a local villager, whose barn he was sleeping in, notified the authorities of his presence. On October 28, 1949, seven members of the group, including Major Nicolae Dabija, were executed in Sibiu.|$|E

50|$|Frame {{pre-emption}} {{allows for}} a significant reduction of the <b>guard</b> <b>band.</b> The length of the <b>guard</b> <b>band</b> is now dependant on the precision of the frame pre-emption mechanism: how small is the minimum size of the frame that the mechanism can still pre-empt. IEEE 802.3br specifies the best accuracy for this mechanism at 64 byte - {{due to the fact}} that this is the minimum size of a still valid Ethernet frame. In this case, the <b>guard</b> <b>band</b> can be reduced to a total of 127 byte: 64 byte (minimum frame) + 63 byte (remaining length that cannot be pre-empted). All larger frames can be pre-empted again and therefore, there is no need to protect against this size with a <b>guard</b> <b>band.</b>|$|E
50|$|To {{partially}} {{mitigate the}} loss of bandwidth through the <b>guard</b> <b>band,</b> the standard IEEE 802.1Qbv includes a length-aware scheduling mechanism. This mechanism is used when store-and-forward switching is utilized: after the full reception of an Ethernet frame {{that needs to be}} transmitted on a port where the <b>guard</b> <b>band</b> is in effect, the scheduler checks the overall length of the frame. If the frame can fit completely inside the <b>guard</b> <b>band,</b> without any infringement of the following high priority slice, the scheduler can send this frame, despite an active <b>guard</b> <b>band,</b> and reduce the waste of bandwidth. This mechanism, however, cannot be used when cut-through switching is enabled, since the total length of the Ethernet frame needs to be known a priori. Therefore, when cut-through switching is used to minimize end-to-end latency, the waste of bandwidth will still occur. Also, this does not help with the minimum achievable cycle time. Therefore, length-aware scheduling is an improvement, but cannot mitigate all drawbacks that are introduced by the <b>guard</b> <b>band.</b>|$|E
