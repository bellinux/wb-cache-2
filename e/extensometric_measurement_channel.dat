40|$|Shearography is a noncontact optical {{technique}} {{used to measure}} surface displacement derivatives. Full surface strain characterization can be achieved using shearography configurations employing at least three <b>measurement</b> <b>channels.</b> Each <b>measurement</b> <b>channel</b> is sensitive to a single displacement gradient component defined by its sensitivity vector. A matrix transformation is then required to convert the measured components to the orthogonal displacement gradients required for quantitative strain measurement. This transformation, conventionally performed using three <b>measurement</b> <b>channels,</b> amplifies any errors present in the measurement. This paper investigates the use of additional <b>measurement</b> <b>channels</b> using {{the results of a}} computer model and an experimental shearography system.

40|$|AbstractDuring load {{tripping}} of {{the hydraulic}} turbine at the Bois power plant, the turbined flow is directly transferred and discharged into an external canal without releasing an alert flow. The {{operation of the turbine}} in bypass mode, which consists in maintaining flow through the penstock and the turbine nozzles, was therefore envisaged to reduce flow variations in the short-circuited section of the scheme, in which people may be found, particularly during the summer season (safety stake). To validate the feasibility of this type of operating mode and, specifically, to verify the structural integrity in operation of the components impacted by the jet (deflector, control rod, jack…), studies were jointly carried out by EDF and CETIM, and a test-calculation program was initiated. This program included preliminary calculations using a finite element model, a campaign of tests in operating conditions (with vibration <b>measurements</b> and dynamic <b>extensometric</b> <b>measurements)</b> and an analysis of the potential damage due to fatigue.

40|$|In 1990 a {{quartz tube}} {{extensometer}} {{was installed in}} the Sopronbánfalva Geodynamic Observatory (SGO) of the Geodetic and Geophysical Research Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. On {{the basis of the}} 20 year data series, an average strain rate of - 5. 36 μstr/y was determined. Because the instrumental drift can also cause a slow change in the output signal of the sensor similar to the tectonic movements, a lot of efforts were made to determine the drift of the extensometer. The instrument has no detectable drift according to the instrumental calibrations (regular calibration, parallel recording by more displacement sensors, etc.). Since autumn of 2008, the radon concentration has been continuously monitored by an AlfaGuard instrument in the SGO. The investigation of the relationship between strain and radon concentration also showed the absence of instrumental drift, so the instrument measures real tectonic movements. The results of the <b>extensometric</b> <b>measurements</b> show that the rate of tectonic movement is not constant. During the period 1993 - 2001, the strain rate accelerated to a maximum of - 8. 6 μstr/y in 2001, and then decelerated again between 2002 - 2010 to approx. - 2. 5 μstr/y in 2010...|$|R

40|$|AbstractLandslides cause many damages both in {{properties}} and in human life. The high loess banks along the River Danube {{are the most}} susceptible areas to mass movements in Hungary. Two test sites, one in Dunaföldvár {{and the other in}} Dunaszekcső, were chosen for the investigation of the kinematic and dynamic processes of the high loess banks due to tectonic, hydrologic and environmental effects. On both test sites, more landslides occurred in the last century. In Dunaszekcső the latest landslide took place in 2008. Here a new landslide has been developing since 2010. In Dunaföldvár borehole tilt and borehole <b>extensometric</b> <b>measurements</b> have been carried out since 2002. In Dunaszekcső the borehole measurements began in the autumn of 2007, thus both the large landslide formed in 2008 and the newly developing landslide could be observed. Comparison of tilt data with ground water level changes and the stage of the River Danube resulted in new knowledge of the landslide development processes of the high loess banks. The measurements made evident that the ground water level changes have two-three orders of magnitude larger effect on the high bank stability than the water level variations of the River Danube. The characteristic tilt processes during a 3 - 4 weeks period before the slump can be used for early warning of landslides. The increasing tilt amplitudes and regression coefficients between tilt and ground water levels could be the precursor of a forthcoming landslide...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: There are high, steep loess banks {{along the}} River Danube in Hungary. Landslides are causing {{a lot of}} damages on this area. Monitoring the surface {{displacements}} of the slope and measuring geophysical, geological, hydrological, meteorological, etc. phenomena by a multi-sensor system can provide valuable information {{for the development of}} a knowledge-based, early warning system. Dunaföldvár is a small town where a number of landslides occurred in the recent past accompanied by damages. That was the reason for the establishment of a geodetic test area here in 2001. Since that time yearly repeated GPS and levelling measurements have been carried out. Two biaxial borehole tiltmeters were installed on the test area in 2002. One was placed on the top and the other at the foot of the high bank. In 2005 a vertical borehole extensometer was also installed for monitoring the vertical movements of the high bank. The ground water level, the level of the Danube, the precipitation and the temperature were also recorded. Because the high bank is in “rest” between abrupt landslides, movements could only be detected by the tilt and <b>extensometric</b> <b>measurements.</b> The continuous tilt measurements showed a permanent SSW tilting with a rate of 47. 3 µrad/year at the top and an eastward tilt with a rate of 3. 1 µrad/year at the foot of the high bank. These tilts are of “atectonic ” origin. Further the ground water, the water level variation of the Danube and the precipitation are in close connection with each other and cause tilt in the range of 1 - 20 µradian. 1...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a shearography instrument for the quantitative measurement of surface strain on dynamic test objects. Shearography is a non-contact, full-field interferometric speckle technique used for the measurement of displacement gradient. It is often used in industry for qualitative inspection of industrial components. To fully characterize the surface strain, a total of six components of displacement gradient are required. These can be measured using shearography instrumentation with at least three <b>measurement</b> <b>channels.</b> Phase <b>measurements</b> from each <b>measurement</b> <b>channel</b> are combined using a matrix transformation to produce the orthogonal displacement gradient measurements. The instrument presented in this thesis possesses four <b>measurement</b> <b>channels</b> consisting of four views of the object under investigation. Images from the four views are transported to the shearing interferometer using coherent fibre-optic imaging bundles. The signals from the four views are then spatially multiplexed onto the four quadrants of a CCD camera. The optical source is a frequency doubled, pulsed Nd:YAG laser which is used to effectively ‘freeze’ the motion of the dynamic object {{for the duration of the}} laser pulse. The optical phase difference between images recorded from two laser pulses is determined using the spatial carrier technique. This method involves introducing a carrier frequency into the recorded speckle pattern using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. A Fourier transform is used to access the phase dependent spectral features, from which the phase distribution is calculated. The instrument is first validated through the measurement of two static test objects. The results of these measurements are compared with modelled data and with results from a multiple-illumination-direction shearography system using a continuous-wave laser. The instrument is then used to investigate two dynamic objects; a plate rotating at 610 rpm and a speaker cone vibrating at frequencies in the range of 1 – 5 kHz.

40|$|A well {{accepted}} {{radio channel}} model approximates the radio channel impulse response by a superposition of {{a finite number}} of propagation paths. Wideband radio <b>channel</b> <b>measurements</b> can be approximated using concentrated propagation paths with an accuracy of close to 100 % down to only 30 % or less, depending on the scenario. For this reason it has been proposed to extend the data model by an additional component describing the distributed scattering (dense multipath component, DMC) of the radio channel. The model for the DMC is parameterized by three parameters, a base delay, the coherence bandwidth or delay-spread, and the attenuation factor of the dense multipath component. It is shown in this paper that the distributed scattering contributes significantly to the capacity of the MIMO-wideband radio channel. In fact it can be oberved in <b>channel</b> sounding <b>measurements</b> that the distributed scattering can contribute more to the channel capacity than the concentrated propagation paths.
