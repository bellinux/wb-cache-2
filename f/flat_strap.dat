2500|$|Long {{before the}} horse collar harness, {{there was the}} less {{efficient}} throat-girth harness. This, it was claimed, {{could be found in}} many ancient civilizations, according to early 20th century French cavalry officer Lefebvre des Noëttes. This type of collar was supposedly used in ancient Chaldea (3rd millennium BC), both Sumeria and Assyria (1400–800 BC), ancient Egypt during the New Kingdom (1570–1070 BC), Shang Dynasty China (1600–1050 BC), Minoan Crete (2700–1450 BC), Classical Greece (550–323 BC), and ancient Rome (510 BC–476 AD). With this [...] "ancient harness," [...] ploughs and carts were pulled using harnesses that had <b>flat</b> <b>straps</b> across the neck and chest of the animal, with the load attached {{at the top of the}} collar, above the neck, in a manner similar to a yoke. These straps pressed against the horse's sterno-cephalicus muscle and trachea which restricted its breathing and reducing the pulling power of the horse. Thus, the harder a horse pulled, the more strongly it choked off its own breathing. [...] Because of these supposed physical constraints, oxen were used in preference to horses for heavy work, as they do not have this problem due to anatomical differences and could be yoked to their loads.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND The rectus abdominis is a long, <b>flat</b> <b>strap</b> muscle {{which extends}} {{vertically}} upward along the linea alba from the pubic symphysis below to the costal margin above. It is a flexor of the vertebral column and thereby {{plays an important}} role in maintaining the normal body posture. As it is a part of the anterior abdominal wall, the strength of the muscle plays a very important role in maintaining the integrity of the anterior abdominal wall. Weakness of the rectus abdominis is seen mainly in multiparous women resulting in the divarication of the recti. The lateral border of the rectus abdominis forms the medial boundary of the Hesselbach’s triangle, which is the commonest site of direct inguinal hernia. It arises by two tendinous heads: Medial head arises from the anterior surface of the pubic symphysis and the lateral head arises from the lateral part of the pubic crest and the pubic tubercle. The muscle is inserted on the anterior thoracic wall by four fleshy slips along a horizontal line passing laterally from the xiphoid process and cutting in that order, the 7 th, 6 th and 5 th costal cartilages. The paired recti muscles are separated in the median plane by the linea alba. The muscle is three times as wide superiorly as inferiorly. It is broad and thin superiorly and narrow and thick inferiorly. It has a tendinous origin and a muscular insertion that is in the form of four fleshy slips that are attached in a horizontal manner to the lower part of the anterior thoracic wall. The rectus abdominis is enclosed in the rectus sheath, which is formed by the aponeuroses of the anterolateral muscles of the anterior abdominal wall. The muscle usually presents tendinous intersections along its length. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study was carried out in the Department of Anatomy, Government Medical College, Kottayam by the dissection of 20 adult cadavers and 5 foetal cadavers during the routine dissection time of the undergraduates and postgraduates. The cadavers were obtained after ethical clearance and were embalmed prior to the study. The rectus sheath was cut by a midline incision to expose the muscle. Measurements were taken, intersections noted and photographed. RESULTS Majority of the cadavers studied (88...|$|E

500|$|A {{significant}} development {{which increased}} {{the importance and}} use of horses in harness, particularly for ploughing and other farm work, was the horse collar. The horse collar was invented in China during the 5th century, arrived in Europe during the 9th century, [...] and became widespread throughout Europe by the 12th century. It allowed horses to pull greater weight than they could when hitched to a vehicle by means of yokes or breastcollars used in earlier times. The yoke was designed for oxen and not suited to the anatomy of horses, it required horses to pull with their shoulders rather than using {{the power of their}} hindquarters. Harnessed in such a manner, horse teams could pull no more than 500kg. [...] The breastplate-style harness that had <b>flat</b> <b>straps</b> across the neck and chest of the animal, while useful for pulling light vehicles, was of little use for heavy work. [...] These straps pressed against the horse's sterno-cephalicus muscle and trachea, which restricted breathing and reduced the pulling power of the horse. Two horses harnessed with a breastcollar harness were limited to pulling a combined total of about [...] [...] In contrast, the horse collar rested on horses' shoulders and did not impede breathing. It allowed a horse to use its full strength, by pushing forward with its hindquarters into the collar rather than to pull with its shoulders. [...] With the horse collar, a horse could provide a work effort of 50% more foot-pounds per second than an ox, because it could move at a greater speed, as well as having generally greater endurance and the ability to work more hours in a day. A single horse with a more efficient collar harness could draw a weight of about [...]|$|R

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{compare the}} {{influence}} of concomitant heeled footwear when wearing a lateral wedged insole for medial compartment of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee, between everyday walking shoes for outdoor use and socks or flat footwear without a heel for indoor use. DesignA total of 227 outpatients were prospectively randomized and treated with a neutral wedged insole inserted into shoes (placebo with shoes; n= 45), a wedged insole inserted into shoes (inserted insole with shoes; n= 45), a sock-type ankle supporter with a wedged insole when wearing socks or flat footwear (inserted insole without shoes; n= 46), a subtalar strapped insole when wearing shoes (strapped insole with shoes; n= 45), and the strapped insole with socks or <b>flat</b> footwear (<b>strapped</b> insole without shoes; n= 46). The Lequesne index of knee OA at week 12 was compared with the baseline in each treatment group. ResultsTwenty patients withdrew from the study, and the 207 patients who completed the 12 -week study were evaluated. At the final assessment, participants wearing the inserted insole without shoes (P= 0. 003), the strapped insole with shoes (P< 0. 0001), and the strapped insole without shoes (P< 0. 0001) demonstrated significantly improved Lequesne index scores in comparison with their baseline assessments. No {{significant differences were found}} in the placebo (P= 0. 16) or the inserted insole with shoes (P= 0. 2) groups. ConclusionConcomitant heeled footwear may decrease the efficacy of an inserted lateral wedged insole. The optimal usage of a lateral wedged insole for knee OA would be the combination with socks or flat footwear without heels...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the claim that {{reductions}} of 8 - 18 % in submaximal oxygen consumption (VO 2) could be due to changing components on a Monark ergometer, from standard pedals without toe-clips or <b>straps</b> (<b>flat</b> pedals) to racing pedals of that era, which included toe-clips and straps (toe-clip pedals). This previously untested assertion was evaluated using 11 males (mean age 22. 3 years, s= 1. 2; height 1. 82 m, s= 0. 07; body mass 82. 6 kg, s= 8. 8) who completed four trials in a randomized, counterbalanced order at 60 rev center dot min(- 1) on a Monark cycle ergometer. Two trials were completed on flat pedals and two trials on toe-clip pedals. The Douglas bag method was used to assess VO 2 and gross efficiency during successive 5 -min workloads of 60, 120, 180, and 240 W. The mean VO 2 was 2. 1 % higher for toe-clip pedals than flat pedals and there was a 99 % probability that toe-clip pedals would not result in an 8 % lower VO 2. These results indicate that toe-clip pedals do not reduce VO 2...|$|R
5000|$|Tell Arslan {{was a more}} {{substantial}} archaeological site in the Sands of Beirut than the open air surface stations, with a full tell mound covering 1 ha situated 8.5 km south of Beirut and about 800 m east of the beach. It was first excavated by Father Auguste Bergy in 1930. It represents the earliest known neolithic village settlement in the Beirut area. [...] Henri Fleisch also recovered more material during a rescue mission in 1948 when the site was levelled due to construction of Beirut airport. All this material {{is now in the}} Saint Joseph University, Museum of Lebanese Prehistory. The site shows evidence of also having been occupied during the Roman era. Pottery and flints were recovered including a variety of axes, knives, chisels, scrapers, borers, and picks. Sickle blades were mostly finely serrated or showed coarse denticulation. Pottery was hardened by firing and included <b>flat</b> bases, a <b>strap</b> handle and a few sherds incised with stab marks and parallel lines. Jacques Cauvin concluded the artefacts similar and the site likely contemporary with middle neolithic periods of Byblos. A.M.T. Moore argued that finds such as Amuq points and short axes were more archaic still, possibly even dating into the Upper Paleolithic. He further suggested the site had been frequented by hunter-gatherer groups forming temporary camps and developed into a village during the early neolithic period.|$|R
40|$|This project {{investigated}} factors {{relating to}} tether use and misuse. Volunteer testing was performed with 37 subjects on 16 different vehicles using 2 forward-facing child restraints (Britax Marathon 70 or the Evenflo Triumph), with each subject performing 8 child restraint installations {{on a set}} of four vehicles. Vehicles were selected to provide a variety of general tether locations (filler panel, upper seatback, lower seatback, floor, or roof), as well as a variety of recommended tether routings with respect to the head restraint: under, over, around. Simple instruction regarding the LATCH system was provided after the fourth trial. Subjects used the tether in 89 % of the 294 forward-facing trials and attached the tether correctly in 57 % of installations. Subjects were more likely to use the tether if they were less than age 40, had previous tether experience, if the tether was located on a filler panel, and if the vehicle did not have any potentially confusing hardware. In addition, tether use was 83 % in the first four trials and increased to 95 % in the last four trials after instruction was provided. Subjects had the greatest difficulty in the pickup truck, which use loops of webbing as a router for the installed position and the tether anchor for the adjacent position; the tether was attached correctly in only 11 percent of installations. Tethers {{were more likely to be}} used when the tether anchor was located on the filler panel of sedans, which had a use rate of 95 percent, compared to when the anchor was located on the floor, roof, or seatback, which had use rates ranging from 79 to 89 percent. Tethers were less likely to be attached correctly when there was potentially confusing hardware present, 47 percent, compared to 70 percent. In addition, tether anchors located on the filler panel or mid seatback had higher rates of correct attachment, 60 and 69 percent, respectively, than those on the floor, roof, or lower seatback, which all had correct attachment rates lower than 50 percent. No vehicle tether hardware characteristics or vehicle manual directions were associated specifically with correct tether routing and head restraint position. Installations involving the single tether strap were 10 times as likely to have the tether attached correctly and 1. 7 times as likely to be routed correctly and have the head restraint positioned correctly, compared with installations with the v-shaped tether. Lack of instruction in most vehicle owner’s manuals regarding the routing of a V-style tether more challenging to use. With the single strap-style tether, it was more straightforward to have the tether <b>strap</b> <b>flat</b> and pull it tight, as well as to route it as directed. With the V-style tether, the adjustment hardware was often located underneath or close to the head restraint when installed in the vehicle, making it difficult to tighten. Recommendations to reduce tether misuse include labeling tether anchors, eliminating confusing hardware, allowing any head restraint position (including removal), providing instruction for routing V-style tethers, allowing options in tether routing, and redesigning tether anchors/routers found in pickup trucks...|$|R
