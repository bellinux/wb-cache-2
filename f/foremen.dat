5|$|The {{principal}} use {{of slavery}} was in agriculture, {{the foundation of}} the Greek economy. Some small landowners might own one slave, or even two. An abundant literature of manuals for landowners (such as the Economy of Xenophon or that of Pseudo-Aristotle) confirms the presence of dozens of slaves on the larger estates; they could be common labourers or <b>foremen.</b> The extent to which slaves were used as a labour force in farming is disputed. It is certain that rural slavery was very common in Athens, and that ancient Greece did not know of the immense slave populations found on the Roman latifundia.|$|E
5|$|Yingzao Fashi is a {{technical}} treatise on architecture and craftsmanship written by Li Jie, an architect and {{official at the}} Directorate of Buildings and Construction. Li completed the book in 1100, and presented it to Emperor Zhezong of Song {{in the last year}} of his reign. His successor, Emperor Huizong of Song, had Li's treatise officially published three years later, in 1103, for the benefit of <b>foremen,</b> architects, and literate craftsmen. The book was intended to provide standard regulations, to not only the engineering agencies of the central government, but also the many workshops and artisan families throughout China who could benefit from using a well-written government manual on building practices.|$|E
5|$|The Shinano River {{system has}} a long history of {{hydroelectric}} power generation, with the first hydroelectric power plant in Japan being located in the system. During the construction of a plant on the Shinano River in the Niigata Prefecture in July 1922, it was reported at the time that Korean workers were being mistreated and murdered. The Shinano River incident involved 1,200 workers, approximately 600 of whom were Korean, who were subjected to regular mistreatment by their Japanese <b>foremen.</b> The mistreatment included malnutrition, forced labour up to sixteen hours a day and severe beatings for those who tried to escape. News articles at the time alleged that up to 100 Koreans were killed during construction and that local farmers had reported seeing bodies floating down river. This incident occurred following the annexation of Korea by Japan and was partially responsible for the development of trade unions for Korean workers in Japan.|$|E
5|$|The {{assassination}} of Hanoi-based French labour recruiter Hervé Bazin on February 9, 1929, {{was a turning}} point that {{marked the beginning of the}} VNQDD's decline. A graduate of the École Coloniale in Paris, Bazin directed the recruitment of Vietnamese labourers to work on colonial plantations. Recruiting techniques often included beating or coercion, because the <b>foremen</b> who did the recruiting received a commission for each enlisted worker. On the plantations, living conditions were poor and the remuneration was low, leading to widespread indignation. In response, Vietnamese hatred of Bazin led to thoughts of an assassination. A group of workers approached the VNQDD with a proposal to kill Bazin. Học felt that assassinations were pointless because they would only prompt a crackdown by the French Sûreté, thereby weakening the party. He felt that it was better to strengthen the party until the time was ripe to overthrow the French, viewing Bazin as a mere twig on the tree of the colonial apparatus.|$|E
25|$|He makes {{particular}} note of artisans and <b>foremen.</b> When {{he wrote}} the book, the majority of houses in Japan were made of wood. In the use of building a house, <b>foremen</b> have to employ strategy based upon the skill and ability of their workers.|$|E
25|$|Work {{began in}} 1868 and {{continued}} for ten years. The dam {{was built by}} a crew of masons numbering from 80 to 100, {{under the direction of}} eight to ten <b>foremen.</b>|$|E
25|$|While Campbell was in London, {{he studied}} the {{building}} of ships and engaged a number of tradesmen and <b>foremen</b> to return to Sydney with him and work for him in his new shipyard. The land was cleared in his absence and timber was held in readiness at Campbell's Wharf.|$|E
25|$|Mine <b>foremen</b> {{and their}} {{families}} rented the single dwellings located {{just east of the}} downtown. First class miners, those men with experience in mining, were assigned the -story double houses {{in the middle of the}} village. These were larger than the -story double dwellings rented to their assistants or laborers.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{the usual}} areas {{included}} {{when the city}} is to be shown to somebody who is unfamiliar with it, other areas of interest include the Barrio Inglés ('English Quarter') where the British <b>foremen</b> and technicians who built the railways and ports lived, and Villa Harding Green, a suburb where the railway and port managers dwelled.|$|E
25|$|The {{village of}} Skogn had {{previously}} been concentrated around Skogn Station. The opening of the mill caused the area to experience rapid expansion. Two new subdivisions were built around the village – Holåsen for engineers and functionaries and Holsandlia for <b>foremen.</b> The increased population was key {{to the development of}} Skogn reaching a population of 2,400 and has helped develop the village and its services.|$|E
25|$|On Monday February 8, 1943, {{the last}} of these five steam {{locomotive}}s, Engine 819, was placed in active service. It was the final locomotive constructed by the Cotton Belt's own staff of mechanical engineers, mechanical officers, <b>foremen</b> and workers in the company shops at Pine Bluff, Arkansas. The cost to build was $143,607.00 and {{it was to be}} the last locomotive produced in Arkansas.|$|E
25|$|Roach {{was also}} not above {{reducing}} the overall wages of his workforce in lean times, {{by as much as}} 15%, but when doing so would also reduce the rents by a corresponding degree for those workers living in housing provided by him. Roach was never able to supply housing for his entire workforce, but he did own about 100 houses in Chester, which were mostly rented by his <b>foremen</b> and other key personnel.|$|E
25|$|In 1937, Vibora Luviminda {{trade union}} {{conducted}} the last strike action of an ethnic {{nature in the}} Hawaiʻian Islands against four Maui sugarcane plantations, demanding higher wages and the dismissal of five <b>foremen.</b> Manuel Fagel and nine other strike leaders were arrested, and charged with kidnapping a worker. Fagel spent four months in jail while the strike continued. Eventually, Vibora Luviminda made its point and the workers won a 15% increase in wages after 85 days on strike, {{but there was no}} written contract signed.|$|E
25|$|A {{group of}} Métis who {{identified}} with the Chippewa moved to the Pembina in 1819 {{and then to the}} Red River area in 1820, which was located near St. François Xavier in Manitoba. In this region they would establish several prominent fur trading communities. These communities had ties to one another through the NWC. This relationship dated back to between 1804 and 1821 when Métis men had served as low level voyageurs, guides, interpreters, and contre-maitres, or <b>foremen.</b> It was from these communities that Métis buffalo hunters operating in the robe trade arose.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the medical}} volunteers almost always receive the most media {{attention}} {{when the world}} becomes aware of an MSF field mission, {{there are a number}} of non-medical volunteers who help keep the field mission functioning. Logisticians are responsible for providing everything that the medical component of a mission needs, ranging from security and vehicle maintenance to food and electricity supplies. They may be engineers and/or <b>foremen,</b> but they usually also help with setting up treatment centres and supervising local staff. Other non-medical staff are water/sanitation specialists, who are usually experienced engineers in the fields of water treatment and management and financial/administration/human resources experts who are placed with field missions.|$|E
25|$|Elofson (2005) {{shows that}} free-range cattle {{ranching}} was {{much the same}} in Montana, Southern Alberta, and Southern Saskatchewan. Benson (2000) describes the social structure for cowboys and other workers on large, corporate ranches in southwestern Alberta around 1900. Four of those ranches, the Cochrane, the Oxley, the Walrond, and the Bar U, demonstrate the complex hierarchies that separated cowboys from cooks and <b>foremen</b> from managers. Ethnic, educational, and age differences further complicated the elaborate social fabric of the corporate ranches. The resulting division of labor and hierarchy permitted Alberta's ranches to function without the direct involvement of investors and owners, most of whom lived in eastern Canada and Britain.|$|E
25|$|Conditions in {{the factory}} were not agreeable, however. The main problem was that several <b>foremen</b> and {{departmental}} heads regarded workers as still being in the army – which they were, but only in theory, since most had been officially ‘discharged’ as unfit for active service at the front. These bosses ruled the workshops under the full might of military law. One of the main clauses of that military law insisted the men should wear military uniform at all times. ‘At all times’ meant everywhere except in the home – {{on the streets of}} the village, going out into Birtley itself (with appropriate military pass) and above all at work, even if that necessitated working for hours on end next to one of the furnaces operating at several hundred degrees.|$|E
25|$|The docks {{required}} {{an army of}} workers, chiefly lightermen (who carried loads between ships and quays aboard small barges called lighters) and quayside workers, who dealt with the goods once they were ashore. Some of the workers were highly skilled - the lightermen had their own livery company or guild, while the deal porters (workers who carried timber) were famous for their acrobatic skills. Most were unskilled and worked as casual labourers. They assembled at certain points, such as pubs, each morning, where they were selected more or less at random by <b>foremen.</b> For these workers, it was effectively a lottery {{as to whether they}} would get work - and pay, and food - on any particular day. This arrangement continued until as late as 1965, although it was somewhat regularised after the creation of the National Dock Labour Scheme in 1947.|$|E
25|$|From 1939 to 1956, the De La Cruz family {{worked for}} the Russell Giffen cotton company. In Huron where they lived from 1944-1956, Lopez-De La Cruz worked in a lunch truck that served Braceros. Her cooking and {{services}} were popular with fieldworkers and community members. She worked in the truck, raised her children, {{and worked in the}} fields with her husband and children. It was during this time that Gary Soto says that Lopez became vocally aware of the injustices faced by farm workers. He noted that Lopez-De La Cruz observed Mexican Americans working in brutally hot conditions, <b>foremen</b> stealing and pocketing workers Social security, state, and federal taxes, company stores on farms charging on average 3 times more than stores in the city knowing that farm workers would only have easy access to the company store; as well as issues like the lack of access to higher education for children of farm workers and the unfair wage hierarchy between racial groups on the farms. In 1957 they moved to Parlier, CA.|$|E
25|$|On the {{posterior}} {{aspect of the}} head are the occiput, postgena, occipital foramen, posterior tentorial pit, gula, postgenal bridge, hypostomal suture and bridge, and the mandibles, labium, and maxilla. The occipital suture is well founded in species of Orthoptera, {{but not so much}} in other orders. Where found, the occipital suture is the arched, horseshoe-shaped groove {{on the back of the}} head, ending at {{the posterior}} of each mandible. The postoccipital suture is a landmark on the posterior surface of the head, and is typically near the occipital <b>foremen.</b> In pterygotes, the postocciput forms the extreme posterior, often U-shaped, which forms the rim of the head extending to the postoccipital suture. In pterygotes, such as those of Orthoptera, the occipital foramen and the mouth are not separated. The three types of occipital closures, or points under the occipital foramen that separate the two lower halves of the postgena, are: the hypostomal bridge, the postgenal bridge, and the gula. The hypostomal bridge is usually found in insects with hypognathous orientation. The postgenal bridge is found in the adults of species of higher Diptera and aculeate Hymenoptera, while the gula is found on some Coleoptera, Neuroptera, and Isoptera, which typically display prognathous-oriented mouthparts.|$|E
25|$|Onderdonk engaged these Chinese labour {{contractors}} who engaged Chinese workers {{willing to accept}} only $1 a day while white, black and native workers were paid three times that amount. Chinese railway workers were hired for 200 miles of the Canadian Pacific Railway considered {{to be among the}} more difficult segments of the projected railway, notably the area that goes through the Fraser Canyon. As with railway workers on other parts of the line in the Prairies and northern Ontario, most of the Chinese workers lived in tents. These canvas tents were often unsafe, and did not provide adequate protection against falling rocks or severe weather in areas of steep terrain. Such tents were typical of working-class accommodations on the frontier for all immigrant workers although (non-Chinese) <b>foremen,</b> shift bosses and trained railwaymen recruited from the UK were housed in sleeping cars and railway-built houses in Yale and the other railway towns. Chinese railway workers also established transient Chinatowns along the rail line, with housing at the largest consisting of log-houses half dug into the ground, which was a common housing style for natives as well as other frontier settlers, because of the insulating effect of the ground in an area of extreme temperatures.|$|E
25|$|Polish {{immigrants}} were highly desired by American employers for low-level positions. In steel mills and tin mills, {{it was observed}} that <b>foremen,</b> even when given the choice to directly employ workers of their own ethnic background, still desired to choose Poles. Steel work was undesirable to other immigrant groups, as it lasted 12 hours a day and 7 days a week, self-selecting for the most industrious and hardworking people. Polish immigrants chose to chain-market the job positions to their friends and relatives, and it was very common for a Polish friend with good English to negotiate wage rates for newer immigrants. Polish Americans favored steel areas and mining camps, which had a high demand for manual labor; favorite destinations included Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee, Cleveland, Buffalo, New York, and Pittsburgh, as well as smaller industrial cities and mining towns. Relatively few went to New England or to farming areas; almost none went to the South. Poles came to dominate certain fields of work: in 1920, 33.1% of all U.S. coal-mine operatives and 25.2% of all blast furnace laborers were Polish. Polish {{immigrants were}} categorized for low-status positions within U.S. companies, as the same steel companies that recruited Polish immigrants for work in blast furnaces recruited Irish immigrants for work with finished metal.|$|E
25|$|On 14 August, Clauson {{issued an}} order {{concerning}} the mandatory requisitioning mules {{for military purposes}} under martial law. From July until November, 2750 mules, 1,200 donkeys and 140 ponies were sent to Salonica. By July 1919, over 3,500 mules and 3,000 had been exported. On 18 October, special legislation banned immigration for Cypriot males of conscription age in order to halt the mass migration of Cypriots to USA. Passports that were already issued were subsequently revoked. A number of rudimentary recruitment posters and leaflets were issued starting from the summer of 1916, the posters were issued in English, Greek and Turkish. Those interested were invited to the recruitment camps situated at Paphos, Limassol, Nicosia, Kyrenia and Famagusta. As of 6 November, 3496 Cypriots had joined the corps in the capacity of muleteers, <b>foremen</b> and interpreters. A crucial factor in the drive's success was the high wages, free food and clothing offered, {{as well as the}} fact that the muleteers were registered as camp followers under the Army Act, a statement that later triggered controversy over the compensation of those killed and injured. In July 1917, the Mule Purchasing Commission was renamed into Muleteer Recruiting and Staff Purchasing Commission, shifting its focus towards the recruiting manpower. During the course of the campaign Cypriot muleteers were tasked with transporting food, weapons, ammunition and water to the front as well as carrying injured soldiers back and working on road construction. The animals and their handlers endured harsh conditions, such as navigating swamps, rivers and mountain terrain during the night and under freezing temperatures.|$|E

They are sleeping on a volcano at Washington and I want men who can go into a fight now." [...] Two days after his arrival, Ellsworth awarded officer commissions to several <b>foremen</b> of the volunteer fire companies and began recruiting in earnest.|$|E
500|$|Edward Shaw, the {{colliery}} manager, was on {{the surface}} and the remaining shift <b>foremen</b> were still underground and unable to give assistance. He took charge and descended the York shaft, accompanied by overman D R Thomas. The descent was slow, and they had to clear several girders and obstructions before they reached the bottom. They found that the men from {{the east side of the}} workings (approximately 450 workers) were unharmed, and their evacuation was ordered. Shaw and Thomas moved to the western side, where they found other men, alive but injured, and arranged for them to travel to the surface. Thomas later reported that the view into the western workings [...] "was exactly like looking into a furnace".|$|E
500|$|In 1937, Lissitzky {{served as}} the lead {{decorator}} for the upcoming All-Union Agricultural Exhibition, reporting to the master planner Vyacheslav Oltarzhevsky but largely independent and highly critical of him. The project was plagued by delays and political interventions. By the end of 1937 the [...] "apparent simplicity" [...] of Lissitzky's artwork aroused {{the concerns of the}} political supervisors, and Lissitzky responded: [...] "The simpler the shape, the finer precision and quality of execution required... yet until now [...] are instructed by the <b>foremen</b> (Oltarzhevsky and Korostashevsky), not the authors" [...] (i.e. Vladimir Shchuko, author of the Central Pavilion, and Lissitzky himself). His artwork, as described in 1937 proposals, completely departed from the modernist art of the 1920s in favor of socialist realism. The iconic statue of Stalin in front of the central pavilion was proposed by Lissitzky personally: [...] "this will give the square its head and its face" [...] (...) [...]|$|E
500|$|The actual {{work was}} done by labourers, in those days known as navvies, {{supervised}} by gangers (or <b>foremen).</b> In the early days the navvies were mainly English {{and many of them}} had formerly worked on building the canals. They were later joined by men from Scotland, Wales and Ireland. [...] The number of Irish workers particularly increased following the potato famine. Brassey paid his navvies and gangers a wage and provided food, clothing, shelter and, in some projects, a lending library. On overseas contracts local labour would be used if it were available, but the work was often done or supplemented by British workers. The agent on the site had overall responsibility for a project. He had to be a man of great capability, working for a fee plus a percentage of the profits, with penalties for late finishing and inducements to complete the work early.|$|E
500|$|Prisoners {{would be}} woken at 6:30 am, {{and sent to}} breakfast at 6:55. After {{returning}} to the cell, inmates then had to tidy their cell and place the waste basket outside. [...] At 7:30 work started in the shifts for those privileged enough to do so, punctuated by a whistle, and prisoners {{would have to go}} through a metal detector during work shifts. If assigned a job, prisoners had to accept that line of work; prisoners were not permitted to have money in their possessions but earnings went into a prisoner's Trust Fund. [...] Some of the prisoners were assigned duties with the guards and <b>foremen</b> in the Laundry, Tailor Shop, Cobblers Shop, Model Shop etc. and in gardening and labor. Smoking, a privilege, was permitted in the workplace providing there wasn't any hazardous condition, but inmates were not permitted to smoke between the recreation yard and work. Lunch was served at 11:20, followed by a 30-minute rest in the cell, before returning to work until 16:15. Dinner was served at 16:25 and the prisoners would then retire to their cells to be locked in for the night at 16:50, and lights went off at 21:30. After being locked in for the night, 6 guards usually patrolled the four cell blocks. Many prisoners have compared their duration at Alcatraz to hell and would have [...] preferred death to continued incarceration.|$|E
2500|$|A {{total of}} seventy seven joiners {{were used in}} teams of eleven under seven <b>foremen</b> and fifty four {{carpenters}} under three <b>foremen.</b> Eighty six goldsmiths were employed under six <b>foremen</b> along with ten sculptors.

Manufacture was suggested to have taken place both in the temple and special workshop (Nippur cubit measuring rod pictured). The splendour of the designs and decorations led Age Westenholz to suggest the anaology of this spiritual sanctuary to the Sumerian empire with that of the Vatican to the Roman Catholic world. The chief administrator of the Ekur or [...] "sanga" [...] of Enlil was appointed by the king and held special status in Nippur and votive inscriptions of the kings indicate that it had held this position since early dynastic times.|$|E
2500|$|Polish <b>foremen</b> {{were used}} to manage and {{supervise}} the workers. many immigrants did not speak English and were wholly dependent on their foreman to communicate to the company. Photographer Lewis Hine spoke with one foreman, who recruited Poles from Baltimore, who said, [...] "I tell you, I have to lie to employees. They're never satisfied. Hard work to get them." [...] The <b>foremen</b> were allowed to beat their workers and functioned as pimps in some cases. Nesterowicz found some <b>foremen</b> convinced attractive women to sleep with their American bosses in exchange for higher-paying positions. The moral degradation and exploitation in the oyster farms led a local Polish priest, Father Helinski, to ask Polish organizations to dissuade any more Poles from entering the business.|$|E

As a staff man negotiating with <b>foremen</b> and executives, the cost accountant must be diplomatic, yet forceful enough {{to take full advantage of}} the discipline that costing makes possible. Nicholson stressed the importance of supplying cost figures that are appropriate for each executive level, and the need to educate <b>foremen</b> and department heads about overhead costs as a first step toward controlling such costs. Cost accountants should give department managers comparative costs of materials, labor, overhead, production quantities, and inventories. Each production department should in turn inform the sales department how all these amounts are likely to vary in relation to changes in sales volume.|$|E
