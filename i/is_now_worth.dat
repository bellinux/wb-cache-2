25|$|For example: Ray sells land to Joe on {{the promise}} that Joe can use Ray's {{driveway}} and bridge to the main road at any time, but Ray {{does not include the}} easement in the deed to the land. Joe, deciding that the land <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>worth</b> the price, builds a house and connects a garage to Ray's driveway. If Ray (or his successor) later decides to gate off the driveway and prevent Joe (or Joe's successor) from accessing the driveway, a court would likely find an easement by estoppel.|$|E

25|$|Although the coin's {{abolition}} {{has been}} proposed because it <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>worth</b> very little, there are currently no firm plans to eliminate the penny. As of 2015, based on the U.S. Mint Annual Report released for 2014, it costs the U.S. Mint 1.67 cents (down from 2.41 cents in 2011 and 1.83 cents in 2013) to make one cent {{because of the cost}} of materials, production, and distribution. This figure includes the Mint's fixed components for distribution and fabrication, as well as Mint overhead allocated to the penny. Fixed costs and overhead would have to be absorbed by other circulating coins without the penny. The loss from producing the one cent coin in the United States for the year of 2013 was $55,000,000. This was a slight decrease from 2012, the year before, which had a production loss of $58,000,000.|$|E
2500|$|... 2015 - Information Services and Technical Services {{revenues}} grew by 8% and 10% respectively, while Austraclear {{chipped in}} with 9%. Another bright spot was the dividend from IRESS, which rose 47% from the prior period, to $4.9m. This financial software company has risen by 27% {{over the past}} couple of years and ASX’s 19.3% stake <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>worth</b> $334m, more than 4% of its own market value.|$|E
2500|$|In 1995, Abramovich and Berezovsky {{acquired}} a controlling {{interest in the}} giant Soviet oil company Sibneft. Affiliates of Abramovich, with affiliates of Boris Berezovsky, purchased Sibneft for US$100.3million (the company was worth US$2.7billion at that time). As of 2000, Sibneft produced around US$3billion worth of oil annually. Abramovich established several [...] "" [...] firms and together with his friend Boris Berezovsky used them to acquire the stock of Sibneft. As a result, the tycoon managed {{to pay for the}} company 25 times less than the market price. Bought for a total of US$200million, Sibneft <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>worth</b> seventy five times as much.|$|E
50|$|In 1837, Baden {{joined the}} South German Monetary Union. This caused the Gulden {{to be reduced}} {{slightly}} in size, as it <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>worth</b> four sevenths of a Prussian Thaler.|$|R

2500|$|The song {{continues}} to be regarded by some critics as a girl-pop classic, though others continue to {{view it as a}} sub-par girl pop song. It was included on several girl-pop compilations, including Growin' Up Too Fast: The Girl Group Anthology (1996), I Wish I Were a Princess: The Great Lost Female Teen Idols (1997), and Early Girls, Vol. 3 (2000). Charli XCX cited the song as an influence when recording her Sucker album.

2500|$|For {{the most}} part, these bills {{were used by}} banks and the Federal {{government}} for large financial transactions. This was especially true for gold certificates from 1865 to 1934. However, for the most part, the introduction of an electronic money system has made large-scale cash transactions obsolete. When combined with concerns about counterfeiting {{and the use of}} cash in unlawful activities such as the illegal drug trade and money laundering, {{it is unlikely that the}} U.S. government will re-issue large denomination currency in the near future, despite the amount of inflation that has occurred since 1969 (a $500 bill <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>worth</b> less, in real terms, than a $100 bill was worth in 1969). According to the U.S. Department of Treasury website, [...] "The present denominations of our currency in production are $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100. The purpose of the United States currency system is to serve the needs of the public and these denominations meet that goal. Neither the Department of the Treasury nor the Federal Reserve System has any plans to change the denominations in use today." ...|$|E
2500|$|China's current {{relationship}} with North Korea and {{position on a}} unified Korea is seen as dependent {{on a number of}} issues. A unified Korea could prevent North Korea's nuclear weapons program from destabilizing East Asia as well as the Chinese government. The 2010 United States diplomatic cables leak mentioned two unnamed Chinese officials telling the Deputy Foreign Minister of South Korea that the younger generation of Chinese leaders increasingly believed that Korea should be reunified under South Korean rule, provided it were not hostile to China. The report also claimed that senior officials and the general public in China were becoming increasingly frustrated with the North acting like a [...] "spoiled child," [...] following its repeated missile and nuclear tests, which were seen as a gesture of defiance not only to the West, but also to China. The business magazine Caixin reported that North Korea accounted for 40% of China's foreign aid budget and required 50,000 tonnes of oil per month as a buffer state against Japan, South Korea, and the United States, with whom trade and investment <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>worth</b> billions (North Korea being seen as expensive and internationally embarrassing to support).|$|E
50|$|From 1842, the Warsaw mint already issued regular-type Russian coins {{along with}} some coins {{denominated}} in both groszy and kopecks. At that time the złoty-to-ruble ratio changed again: 1 ruble <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>worth</b> only 2 złote.|$|R

5000|$|This {{is similar}} to the first round, but the object is to guess who got the {{question}} wrong; for each question, only two of the [...] "savants" [...] are considered (one of whom answered correctly), and correct guesses <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>worth</b> $200.|$|R
60|$|THE INCA. For {{materials}} and manufacture alone, {{half a million}} Perusalem dollars, madam. The Inca's design constitutes it a work of art. As such, it <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>worth</b> probably ten million dollars.|$|E

60|$|Evening. My tail hangs low. I thought I was a financier--and I bragged to you. I am not bragging, now. The stock which I sold {{at such a}} fine profit {{early in}} January, has never ceased to advance, and <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>worth</b> $60,000 more than I sold it for. I feel just as if I had been {{spending}} $20,000 a month, and I feel reproached for this showy and unbecoming extravagance.|$|E
5000|$|The {{third round}} {{saw the two}} contestants choose one of the [...] "savants" [...] to work with for the entire round. The round was known as [...] "Pick Your Pony" [...] {{for the first three}} seasons and [...] "Pick Your Brain" [...] in the final two seasons. Each {{question}} goes to an individual contestant, who must decide whether their [...] "brain/pony" [...] got the question right or wrong. Three questions are asked of each contestant, for a total of six in the round. Correct guesses <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>worth</b> $300. The Dunce Cap is back in this round, regardless of whether it was used in the previous round. Once again there is one dunce per round, but dunces <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>worth</b> $300.|$|R

6000|$|... "Very possibly, de la Molle, {{but to be}} honest, I {{very much}} doubt if Honham Castle and the lands round it would now fetch twenty-five {{thousand}} pounds on a forced sale. Competition and Radical agitation have brought estates down more than people realise, and land in Australia and New Zealand <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>worth</b> almost as much per acre as cultivated lands in England. Perhaps as a residential property and on account of its historical interest it might fetch more, but I doubt it. In short, Mr. de la Molle, so anxious are Cossey and Son in the matter, that I regret {{to have to tell}} you that so far from being willing to make a further advance, the firm have formally instructed me to serve the usual six months' notice on you, calling in the money already advanced on mortgage, together with the interest, which I must remind you is nearly a year overdue, and this step I propose to take to-morrow." ...|$|E

Is there any man in the House better listened to than John Brough? Is there any duke in the land that can give a better dinner than John Brough; or a larger fortune to his daughter than John Brough? Why, sir, the humble person now speaking to you could buy out many a German duke! But I'm not proud--no, no, not proud. There's my daughter--look at her--when I die, she will be mistress of my fortune; but am I proud? No! Let him who can win her, marry her, that's what I say.

60|$|Suppose, for example, {{that gold}} rises in value {{relatively}} to silver, {{so that the}} quantity of gold in a sovereign <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>worth</b> more than the quantity of silver in twenty shillings. Two consequences will ensue. No debtor will any longer find it his interest to pay in gold. He will always pay in silver, because twenty shillings are a legal tender for a debt of one pound, and he can procure silver convertible into twenty shillings for less gold than that contained in a sovereign. The other consequence will be that, unless a sovereign can be sold {{for more than twenty}} shillings, all the sovereigns will be melted, since as bullion they will purchase a greater number of shillings than they exchange for as coin. The converse of all this would happen if silver, instead of gold, were the metal which had risen in comparative value. A sovereign would not now be worth so much as twenty shillings, and whoever had a pound to pay would prefer paying it by a sovereign; while the silver coins would be collected for the purpose of being melted, and sold as bullion for gold at their real value—that is, above the legal valuation. The money of the community, therefore, would never really consist of both metals, but of the one only which, at the particular time, best suited the interest of debtors; and the standard of the currency would be constantly liable to change from the one metal to the other, at a loss, on each change, of the expense of coinage on the metal which fell out of use.|$|E
25|$|Partly {{because of}} its {{suppression}} by both Australian and British authorities (many editions of London OZ were banned in Australia), copies of both incarnations of the magazine <b>are</b> <b>now</b> rare and the British issues command high prices among collectors—individual copies of the most sought-after editions <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>worth</b> several hundred pounds each.|$|R
