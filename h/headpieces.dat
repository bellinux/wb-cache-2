During the pre-chorus, Utada sings in front of a forest-like backdrop, whilst a stop-motion animation of her is walking through the woods, observing disfigured creatures.

40|$|The villin-type 2 ̆ 2 <b>headpiece</b> 2 ̆ 2 domain is a modular motif {{found at}} the extreme C-terminus of larger 2 ̆ 2 core 2 ̆ 2 domains in over 25 cytoskeletal {{proteins}} in plants and animals. Although <b>headpiece</b> is classified as an F-actin-binding domain, {{it has been suggested}} that some expressed fusion-proteins containing <b>headpiece</b> may lack F-actin-binding in vivo. To determine the intrinsic F-actin affinity of <b>headpiece</b> domains, we quantified the F-actin affinity of seven <b>headpiece</b> domains and three N-terminal truncations, under identical in vitro conditions. The constructs are folded and adopt the native <b>headpiece</b> structure. However, they show a wide range of affinities that can be grouped into high, low, and nonspecific-binding categories. Computer models of the structure and charged surface potential of these <b>headpiece</b> domains suggest features important for high F-actin affinity. We conclude that not all <b>headpiece</b> domains are intrinsically F-actin-binding motifs, and suggest that the surface charge distribution may be an important element for F-actin recognition...|$|R
40|$|Negative stain {{electron}} microscopy (EM) and adhesion assays show that αXβ 2 integrin activation requires <b>headpiece</b> opening {{as well as}} extension. An extension-inducing Fab to the β 2 leg, in combination with representative activating and inhibitory Fabs, were examined for effect on the equilibrium between the open and closed <b>headpiece</b> conformations. The two activating Fabs stabilized the open <b>headpiece</b> conformation. Conversely, two different inhibitory Fabs stabilized the closed <b>headpiece</b> conformation. Adhesion assays revealed that αXβ 2 in the extended-open <b>headpiece</b> conformation had high affinity for ligand, whereas both the bent conformation and the extended-closed <b>headpiece</b> conformation represented the low affinity state. Intermediate integrin affinity appears to result not from a single conformational state, but from a mixture of equilibrating conformational states...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe F-actin binding {{properties}} of chicken villin, its <b>headpiece</b> and domains 2 – 3 (V 2 - 3) have been analysed to identify sites involved in bundle formation. <b>Headpiece</b> and V 2 - 3 bind actin with Kd values of ~ 7 μM and ~ 0. 3 μM, respectively, at low ionic strength. V 2 - 3 binding, {{like that of}} villin, is weakened with increasing salt concentration; <b>headpiece</b> binding is not. Competition experiments show that <b>headpiece</b> and V 2 - 3 bind to different sites on actin, forming the two cross-linking sites of villin. <b>Headpiece</b> does not compete with the F-actin binding domains of gelsolin or α-actinin, but it dissociates actin depolymerizing factor. We suggest that the F-actin binding domains of actin severing, crosslinking and capping proteins can be organized into two classes...|$|R

40|$|Dematin is an actin-binding and {{bundling}} protein of the erythrocyte membrane skeleton. Dematin is localized to the spectrin–actin junctions, and its actin-bundling {{activity is}} regulated by phosphorylation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The carboxyl terminus of dematin is homologous to the “headpiece” domain of villin, an actin-bundling protein of the microvillus cytoskeleton. The <b>headpiece</b> domain contains an actin-binding site, a cAMP-kinase phosphorylation site, plays {{an essential role}} in dematin self-assembly, and bundles F-actin in vitro. By using homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem cells, the <b>headpiece</b> domain of dematin was deleted to evaluate its function in vivo. Dematin <b>headpiece</b> null mice were viable and born at the expected Mendelian ratio. Hematological evaluation revealed evidence of compensated anemia and spherocytosis in the dematin <b>headpiece</b> null mice. The <b>headpiece</b> null erythrocytes were osmotically fragile, and ektacytometry/micropore filtration measurements demonstrated reduced deformability and filterability. In vitro membrane stability measurements indicated significantly greater membrane fragmentation of the dematin <b>headpiece</b> null erythrocytes. Finally, biochemical characterization, including the vesicle/cytoskeleton dissociation, spectrin self-association, and chemical crosslinking measurements, revealed a weakened membrane skeleton evidenced by reduced association of spectrin and actin to the plasma membrane. Together, these results provide evidence for the physiological significance of dematin and demonstrate a role for the <b>headpiece</b> domain in the maintenance of structural integrity and mechanical properties of erythrocytes in vivo...|$|R
