40|$|Abstract—A {{geographically}} {{continuous movement}} {{model can be}} deduced from the quadratic transshipment problem by considering the transportation network as a discrete mesh. The resulting system of coupled Helmholz equations can be considered to solve simultaneously the spatially continuous versions of the traffic “distribution ” and “assignment ” problems. The associated Lagrangian functions {{are similar to the}} potentials of classical flow theory. Numerical methods implement the procedure. This work uses a sequence of elementary discrete geographic movement models to lead to an equivalent spatially continuous version, which then involves potential fields describable by a system of partial differential equations. One departure from classical results {{is that there is a}} different potential <b>for</b> <b>gross</b> and <b>for</b> <b>net</b> movements, the one allowing for simultaneous movement in more than one direction at each place. The models solve the “distribution ” and “assignment” problems of transportation and traffic engineering. The irregular and awkward geographic topologies encountered in practice require that numerical methods be used for solution of the system of equations. To start, consider a simple journey-to-work problem. Assume that the territory of interest i...|$|R

We investigated the effect of water temperature on plant morphology, biomass accumulation and oxygen-exchange for five clones of the submerged aquatic macrophyte Potamogeton pectinatus L., originating from 42 to 68 °N. 2 We tested whether P. pectinatus clones show local adaptation to the prevailing environmental temperatures (in which case high-latitude clones would perform better at lower temperatures and vice versa). Alternatively, pronounced phenotypic plasticity in the response to temperature could enable individual clones to perform well over a wide range of environmental temperatures (i. e. high degree of thermal tolerance). 3 The overall pattern of thermal response was similar for all clones. In addition, we detected acclimative phenotypic plasticity in both physiological and morphological plant parameters. The optimum temperatures <b>for</b> <b>gross</b> or <b>for</b> <b>net</b> photosynthesis did not vary with growth temperature, but morphological acclimation partly compensated for the loss of photosynthetic capacity at higher temperatures, enabling comparable rates of ambient gross photosynthesis. Respiratory reactions also showed some d 4 As a result of the combined effects of changes in morphology and physiology, all clones produced similar amounts of plant biomass over a relatively wide range of water temperatures. We therefore conclude that P. pectinatus is thermally tolerant and not locally adapted. ...|$|R

In this paper, we discuss whether or not the partner's characteristics should be treated as responsibility factors. Using German micro data, we analyze empirically, how IOp estimates are affected when a partner's circumstance or effort variables are included as own circumstances in the analysis.

40|$|Aim: This {{cross-sectional}} study into {{children and young}} adults with cerebral palsy (CP) aimed to assess the association of gross energy cost (EC), net EC and net nondimensional (NN) EC during walking with age and body height, compared to typically developing (TD) peers. Method: Data was collected in 128 participants with CP (mean age 11 y 9 mo; GMFCS I,n = 48; II,n = 56; III, n= 24) and in 63 TD peers (mean age 12 y 5 mo). Energy cost was assessed by measuring the oxygen consumption during over-ground walking at comfortable speed. Outcome measures derived from the assessment included the gross and net EC, and NN EC. Differences between the groups in the association between gross, net and NN EC with age and body height, were investigated with regression analyses and interaction effects (p < 0. 05). Results: Interaction effects for age and body height by group were not significant, indicating similar associations <b>for</b> <b>gross,</b> <b>net</b> and NN EC with age or body height among groups. The models showed a significant decline <b>for</b> <b>gross,</b> <b>net</b> and NN EC with increasing age per year (respectively - 0. 201 J kg(- 1) m(- 1); - 0. 073 J kg(- 1) m(- 1); - 0. 007) and body height per cm (respectively - 0. 057 J kg(- 1) m(- 1); - 0. 021 J kg(- 1) m(- 1); - 0. 002). Interpretation: Despite higher gross and <b>net</b> EC values <b>for</b> CP compared to TD participants, similar declines in EC outcomes can be expected with growth for participants aged 4 - 22 years with CP. All energy cost outcomes showed a decline with growth, indicating that correcting for this decline is required when evaluating changes in gross EC, and, to a lesser extent, in net and NN EC in response to treatment or from natural course over time.

50|$|This was {{theoretically}} {{a confusing}} issue, because sometimes {{it seemed that}} a surplus arose out of clever trading in already existing assets, while at other times {{it seemed that the}} surplus arose because new value was added in production. In other words, a surplus could be formed in different ways, and one could get rich either at the expense of someone else, or by creating more wealth than there was before, or by a mixture of both. This raised the difficult problem of how, then, one could devise a system <b>for</b> <b>grossing</b> and <b>netting</b> incomes & expenditures to estimate only the value of the new additional wealth created by a country. For centuries, there was little agreement about that, because rival economists each had their own theory about the real sources of wealth-creation - even if they might agree that the value of production must equal the sum of the new revenue which it generates for the producers.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} public policy on interregional migration in Canada using new interprovincial migration data constructed from personal income tax files for the years 1974 to 1996. We consider the consequences <b>for</b> <b>gross</b> and <b>net</b> migration flows of regional variation in employment insurance, provincial social assistance, personal income taxes and public spending of different types, and we compare {{the effects of these}} policies to the impacts on migration of wages, employment prospects and moving costs. We also conduct a preliminary investigation of the migration consequences of certain extraordinary political events in Quebec and of the closing of the cod fishery in Newfoundland. Unemployment insurance is an especially important and well documented source of income for many people, and regional variation in the generosity of the insurance system over the last three decades has been substantial. The results suggest that while increasing the generosity of the system in high unemployment regions may have induced more migration to the Atlantic region than would otherwise have occurred, the resulting changes in gross flows are probably not large and have had, at most, small effects on average provincial unemployment rates.

The relationships between respiration, photosynthesis, irradiance and temperature followed standard patterns. Temperature optima <b>for</b> <b>gross</b> and <b>net</b> photosynthesis were 10 – 20 and 0 – 20 °C respectively, suggesting that the plants were not truly psychrophilic. Photosynthesis was saturated at 30 – 270 μmol m− 2 s− 1, consistent with the view that bryophytes are, physiologically, shade plants, {{although there was no}} evidence of photoinhibition over the range of irradiances tested (up to 700 μmol m− 2 s− 1). Comparison of the results with environmental data suggests that photosynthesis is usually temperature-limited during daylight in the growing season. Therefore, any change in the temperature of the habitat could affect the productivity of the bryophytes. Rates of photosynthesis varied widely between species, and these relationships were largely maintained over the range of temperatures and irradiances tested. Photosynthetic rankings were correlated with the water availability in the plant habitats, supporting the hypothesis that water is the important factor in determining the distribution of populations in Antarctic habitats...|$|R
40|$|Historic land-cover/use {{change is}} {{important}} for studies on climate change, soil carbon, and biodiversity assessments. Available reconstructions focus on the net area difference between two time steps (net changes) instead of accounting for all area gains and losses (gross changes). This leads to a serious underestimation of land-cover/use dynamics with impacts on the biogeochemical and environmental assessments based on these reconstructions. In this study, we quantified to what extent land-cover/use reconstructions underestimate land-cover/use changes in Europe for the 1900 - 2010 period by accounting <b>for</b> <b>net</b> changes only. We empirically analyzed available historic land-change data, quantified their uncertainty, corrected for spatial-temporal effects and identified underlying processes causing differences between gross and net changes. <b>Gross</b> changes varied <b>for</b> different land classes (largest for forest and grassland) and led to two to four {{times the amount of}} net changes.
