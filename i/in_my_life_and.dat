5|$|I {{had gone}} to Puerto Rico and was {{influenced}} by Latin music at that moment. When I came back, the melody was in my head. It was at a melancholy point <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> the song reflects the yearning {{that was going on}} inside of me. It was like being in a situation but you want to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing. Thats why {{think a lot of people}} felt very strongly about that song, because the emotion is clear when you listen to it.|$|E

His ideas in this passage were vague, but they were idealistic.|$|E

Victoria said: “I {{felt like an}} accelerating train, going right down... during the whole period. I had eating disorders and was aware of it, my anguish was enormous.

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>My</b> <b>Life</b> <b>and</b> Work Ford speaks (briefly) {{of racing}} {{in a rather}} dismissive tone, as {{something}} that is not at all a good measure of automobiles in general. He describes himself as someone who raced only because in the 1890s through 1910s, one had to race because prevailing ignorance held that racing was the way to prove the worth of an automobile. Ford did not agree. But he was determined that as long as this was the definition of success (flawed though the definition was), then his cars would be the best that there were at racing. Throughout the book, he continually returns to ideals such as transportation, production efficiency, affordability, reliability, fuel efficiency, economic prosperity, and the automation of drudgery in farming and industry, but rarely mentions, and rather belittles, the idea of merely going fast from point A to point B.|$|E
25|$|When first published, The Lives of John Lennon was {{controversial}} {{because of}} its portrayal of Lennon in a highly critical light. Lennon was presented in the book as a talented but deeply flawed man who manipulated people and relationships throughout his life, flinging them aside when {{they were no longer}} useful to him. Goldman also suggested that Lennon was an anti-Semite and a heavy drug-user and that he had dyslexia and schizophrenia. The author even went into detail about the long-rumored homosexual affair between Lennon and The Beatles' manager Brian Epstein (previously discussed in both Pete Shotton's Lennon <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Life</b> <b>and</b> Peter Brown's The Love You Make books), as well as alleging a number of liaisons by Lennon with other men, including a claim that he solicited underage male prostitutes in Thailand. This latter assertion greatly angered Yoko Ono and Paul McCartney. The book was criticized by Lennon fans for allegedly containing much unsubstantiated conjecture, and tending to present worst-case scenarios when doing so.|$|E

When asked why he retained interest in the project for over 26 years, Scorsese stated: [...] "As you get older, ideas go and come. Questions, answers, loss of the answer again and more questions, and this is what really interests me. Yes, the cinema and the people <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> my family are most important, but ultimately as you get older, there's got to be more... Silence is just something that I'm drawn to in that way. It's been an obsession, it has to be done... it's a strong, wonderful true story, a thriller in a way, but it deals with those questions." ...|$|E
