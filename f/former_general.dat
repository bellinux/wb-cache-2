When <b>former</b> <b>general</b> manager Luciano Moggi's conviction in criminal court in connection with the scandal was thrown out by an appeals court in 2015, the club sued the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) for €443million for damages caused by their 2006 relegation.

5|$|Later, {{in early}} 348 BC, the Olynthians appealed for help again. The Athenians sent Charidemos, a <b>former</b> <b>general</b> of Kersebleptes {{who had been}} adopted as an Athenian citizen, with 4000 peltasts, 150 cavalry and 18 triremes; of the triremes, 10 were {{probably}} already in his service, and the other 8 may have been those sent to Chares in 349 BC. Charidemus joined up with the Olynthians, and together they attacked the former territory of Olynthos in western Chalkidike. Finally, just before the final siege of Olynthos started, the Olynthians appealed a last time for aid. The Athenians prepared to send a force of citizen hoplites, but they were delayed by the weather, {{probably due to the}} Etesian winds, and arrive too late to achieve anything.|$|E
5|$|Lindemann's first gunnery officer—Lieutenant Commander Adalbert Schneider—had {{been awarded}} the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 27 May 1941. Traditionally, the {{commanding}} officer would have received this award before any other crew member was so honoured. This exception had been criticized by various circles in the Wehrmacht. It is thought likely that Ernst Lindemann's cousin, the <b>former</b> <b>General</b> der Kavallarie (General of the Cavalry) Georg Lindemann, intervened. Grand Admiral Erich Raeder, with whom Lindemann shared a 20-year comradeship dating to {{the early days of}} the Reichsmarine, presented the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross to Mrs Lindemann on Tuesday, 6 January 1942, in Dahlem. Raeder went on to provide moral and emotional support to Lindemann's mother and widow.|$|E

5|$|The 50 Greatest Players in National Basketball Association History (also {{referred}} to as NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team or NBA's Top 50) were chosen in 1996 to honor the fiftieth anniversary {{of the founding of}} the National Basketball Association (NBA). These fifty players were selected through a vote by a panel of media members, former players and coaches, and current and <b>former</b> <b>general</b> managers. In addition, the top ten head coaches and top ten single-season teams in NBA history were selected by media members as part of the celebration. The fifty players had to have played at least a portion of their careers in the NBA and were selected irrespective of position played.|$|E
5|$|The Iazyges, Quadi, Suebi and Marcomanni {{once again}} invaded Roman {{territory}} in 169. The Iazyges led an invasion into Alburnum, {{in an attempt}} to seize its gold mines. Marcus Claudius Fronto, a <b>former</b> <b>general</b> during the Parthian wars, then the governor of both Dacia and Upper Moesia, held them back for some time but was killed in battle in 170. The Quadi were the first to surrender, in 172. The known terms of the peace are that Marcus Aurelius installed a client king, Furtius, on their throne, and the Quadi were denied access to the Roman markets along the limes. The Marcomanni accepted a similar peace, but the name of their client-king is not known.|$|E
5|$|After the fortress's {{military}} importance decreased {{at the end}} of the 19th century, Tvrđa {{became a}} center of administrative, educational, cultural, and scholarly life in Osijek and the entire region. The first school in Osijek was organized at Tvrđa; the first scholarly curriculum was introduced in 1707, to be later expanded and renewed, and the first printing press started working in 1735. The significance of educational institutions of Tvrđa are best underlined by the fact that Croatian Nobel Prize laureates, Lavoslav Ružička and Vladimir Prelog, along with Serbian scientist Milutin Milanković (Milankovitch cycles), were all alumni (graduates) of the Tvrđa schools. The Faculty of Agriculture of the Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek has occupied the <b>former</b> <b>general</b> headquarters since 1995 after its previous site was destroyed in the Croatian War of Independence. The Faculty of Food Technology has been relocated to a building that served as the first military hospital in Osijek, from the mid-17th century until the beginning of the 1990s. Other present-day educational institutions in Tvrđa include the II and the III Gymnasium, Franjo Kuhač Music School (former Roman Catholic Seminary), Jesuit Classical Gymnasium (former logistics barracks built in the mid-18th century), and the Secondary School of Economics (former grammar school for girls).|$|E
