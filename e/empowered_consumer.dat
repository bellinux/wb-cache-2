40|$|Purpose - An {{oral history}} {{to examine the}} {{evolution}} of the <b>empowered</b> <b>consumer</b> and brand consciousness from 1918 to 1965 as a critical analysis of mass consumer culture in Britain. Design/methodology/approach - The authors trace the changing experience of consumer empowerment and importantly show oral testimony (oral history) as a method able to reveal the complexities of this experience. Findings - Women locate increased choice and responsibility within changing marketing and retailing systems (including self-service, branding and the media). The authors show how increased choice and responsibility was often experienced (at least initially) as challenging or confusing. Originality/value - The study identifies that empowerment is a complex or paradoxical process. It provides empirical support for a growing number of claims that have challenged the linear benefit assumptions given to increased choice arising from classic economic theory and outline a model of the paradox of {{the evolution of the}} <b>empowered</b> <b>consumer.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the war to}} win the consumer’s {{attention}} traditional {{media is}} steadily losing ground to new media platforms; which are distributed and consumed digitally, are ubiquitous with the explosive uptake of smart internet connected devices and provide interconnections amongst platforms, devices and even consumers. New media is changing {{the balance of power}} in the media landscape from media businesses to media consumers, who now have unlimited choices available to them from which they can decide on what, when, where and how to consume content. So from the traditional outlook of ―mass media‖ there is a transition happening towards ―my media‖ which provide personalised experiences to consumers. The purpose of this study is to contribute to the discussion on how consumer control is changing the media landscape by applying the dichotomy of push vs. pull in media consumption. The study sought to explore if with increasing consumer empowerment, the consumer instead of passively relying on content push from media businesses is now actively pulling content to fulfil his/her individual needs. The study was qualitative and exploratory in nature and utilised in depth and semi structured interviews of media consumers and experts to understand in how the role of the consumer is changing in the media landscape, the factors influencing the change, how the <b>empowered</b> <b>consumer</b> is effecting changes in the way he/she consumes content and media business response to the <b>empowered</b> <b>consumer</b> The study empirically established that consumer control is definitely on the rise in media consumption with consumers preferring to pull content as per their liking. Furthermore it was empirically validated that consumers from lower income levels were as much in control and pulling content as consumers from higher income levels which is a significant departure from the literature. The study also found that even though media businesses acknowledge consumer control in media consumption their response to it is applying certain tactics without any accompanying change in strategies and business models. The study recommended that for media businesses to stay relevant in the age of consumer control and the accompanying content pull; they need to be more customer centric in their approach where they design their strategies and business models by being consumer focussed and trying to fulfil their needs.

40|$|The {{concept of}} the <b>empowered</b> <b>consumer</b> cannot be {{considered}} as a field of exact scientific research yet. Nevertheless, it has become part of scholars’ interest and gains more and more importance in the research of organisational relationships with customers. It is suggested that two influencing criteria are especially at the forefront: The emergence of the Internet, which effected that barriers to collect and to disseminate information across boundaries were decisively reduced. As a consequence consumers could organise globally and collect and exchange information and experiences about organisations and their products. Furthermore, flexible interactivity between companies and consumers, but particularly from consumers to consumers enable direct interaction changing many previously established rules of doing business. Due to these new opportunities new business models developed and the proposition is that intangible values such as reputation gained even more importance and influence tangible outcomes. Suggestions are that 1.), this concept links communication, corporate behaviour and legitimacy of activities influencing reputation as a driver of value. 2.), reputation as a corporate asset can be managed but it is beyond the pure control of an organisation. 3.), reputation is part of public perception, which an organisation has to build, maintain and expand depending on communicative abilities and willingness to accept consumers as a centre of power. The following discussion will present Grunig et al. ’s communication model explaining changed organisational challenges. It is put forward as a framework for marketing for times in which online opportunities added to the earlier b 2 b and b 2 c models c 2 c and P 2 P considerations and architectures. The annual studies of the market research institute puls undertaking regular representative research among German consumers since November 2005 will present evidence for the relationship of improved prices, which may be achieved, and the perception a firm possesses. This paper deals mostly with German examples and data, but the hypothesis is that a) the general situation in other Western countries is alike, but needs b) specific additional research, since cultural differences are expected to have a considerable influence, especially when criteria such as individualist and collectivist organisation of society and high and low context communication styles are involved. Hence, the results of the same study in different countries are therefore expected to present some variation. Additionally, the Cluetrain Manifesto challenges corporate behaviour of those companies still believing {{to have the ability to}} control information disseminated by and written about it. Examples provided will support the hypothesis that powerful consumers may have significant impact on organisational behaviour, decision-making and outcomes.

40|$|Information {{technology}} is empowering consumers through {{the availability of}} information, interactivity of online communication tools, and the connectivity with others. The newly <b>empowered</b> <b>consumer</b> is a co-creator of brand communications and is rapidly developing a sense of co-ownership in brands. Consumers are increasingly imposing themselves on the marketing function leaving many practitioners perplexed and unsure about how to respond. This thesis reports on five studies conducted to address specific challenges to marketers. The proactive marketer needs {{to respond to the}} adjustment in the marketing equilibrium by initiating and sustaining a meaningful dialogue with the marketplace. It was found that to initiative online brand communications, bloggers and event sponsorship can be effective means, but both have specific requirements and sponsorship is subject to ambush marketing. Consumers may respond to brands by creating their own online brand content which has a source-effect on online advertising. As consumer's brand communications rely on their relationships with the brand, the use of brands as means of self-expression is investigated.

40|$|The {{importance}} of adequate professional disclosure has recently received increased at-tention in the counseling and psychology literature. Despite this trend, the rehabilita-tion counseling professional literature contains little {{information about the}} prevalence and manner in which this practice is used within rehabilitation counseling. This article reviews the relevant literature and discusses its implications for rehabilitation coun-selors. The authors discuss the use and content of disclosure forms and practices, in-cluding {{the degree to which}} mental health professionals actually use such forms and reasons for nonuse. Clinical and research needs regarding professional disclosure within rehabilitation counseling are also discussed. ~ t he use of professional disclosure forms within health-care settings has increased dramatically {{over the past several decades}} (Handelsman, 1990). Whereas it was traditionally assumed that one should never ques-tion the judgment or authority of health-care profes-sionals, such assumptions increasingly have come under attack. Within the disability community, in particular, the combined effects of the consumerism and civil rights move-ments have resulted in a better informed, increasingly <b>empowered</b> <b>consumer</b> (Shapiro, 1993). Even among indi-viduals who are often perceived as being unable to under-stand or use such information well enough to make rational, informed decisions (e. g., some individuals with psychiatric disabilities, developmental disabilities, or brain injuries), there has been an increased emphasis on the need to pro-vide information and encourage independent decision mak-ing to the extent possible (Shaw, 1994; Stebnicki, 1997) ...|$|E
40|$|This article uses data {{gathered}} from interviews with game designers and {{a survey of}} {{a core group of}} 30 players to suggest that Alternate Reality Games (ARGs) allow media producers to develop a close relationship with consumers, prompting us to rethink previous notions of power in contemporary producer/consumer relationships. Discourse has moved from a resistant/incorporated dichotomy (Abercrombie and Longhurst 1998; Hills 2002) to the suggestion that fandom has become a normative mode of mainstream media consumption (Jenkins 2007). Theories of digital convergence and collective intelligence are often mobilised to argue for fans as <b>empowered</b> <b>consumer</b> collectives, increasing their ability to control decisions around their favoured media products (Jenkins 2006). Promotional ARGs are unique sites for studying this complex relationship. ARGs have been used since around 2001 to promote a number of films including A. I. : Artificial Intelligence (Steven Spielberg, 2001) and The Dark Knight (Christopher Nolan, 2008). They create a narrative mystery set {{in the world of the}} film which is broken down and scattered across the internet. Players work collaboratively in online fan communities to reconstruct that narrative using everyday media channels such as email, websites, phone calls, voicemails, and larger scale live events, like scavenger hunts. Such games are sites of real-time interaction creating a give/take relationship between producers and consumers, which results in a more complex system of co-creation and negotiated ownership, as opposed to resistance, incorporation, or indeed cultural empowerment...|$|E
40|$|Technology {{has brought}} many {{opportunities}} to organisations in the tourism sector, for example, {{with regard to the}} efficiencies achieved by embracing self-service technologies (SSTs), such as self-check-in online and mobile restaurant apps. Equally, the nature of the online environment, in terms of its connectivity, immediacy, access to information and facility for real-time sharing and collaboration has resulted in a more <b>empowered</b> <b>consumer.</b> One manifestation of such consumer empowerment is the growing phenomenon of consumers who are embracing the internet as a means of reviewing and communicating their tourism experiences in the form of online reviews (Ong, 2012). Online reviews essentially constitute a form of word-of-mouth presented on the internet (Mangold and Smith, 2012) and in a consumer context, represent a form of peer-to-peer information whereby consumers seek to document and share their experiences with others, on a range of online platforms. These platforms include social media (e. g. Facebook, Twitter,) blogs, company websites, consumer review sites (e. g. Trip Advisor, Expedia) and search engine sites (e. g. Google). The influence of online reviews can be traced to their facility for assisting consumers to develop a balanced understanding of a given product, to identify a suite of criteria for evaluating the product, to arrive at a specific product choice, and to reduce the perceived risk of making that choice (Liu, Karahanna and Watson, 2011). Critically, it has also been noted that the opinions of fellow customers are deemed to hold stronger credibility than information and communications emanating from companies (Simonson and Rosen, 2014; Sheth, 1999). However, whilst there is widespread awareness of the surge in consumer online reviews, the literature sounds a note of caution regarding how companies are responding to this phenomenon. For example, Simonson and Rosen (2014) caution that many companies are simply ignoring the trend whilst Mangold and Smith (2012) suggest that there is a large gap in the literature regarding which product categories are most impacted upon by online reviews. Elsewhere, Ong (2012) highlights that whilst a number of studies has focused on the influence of online reviews in the context of tangible goods such as books and electronic items, there is relatively little literature addressing how consumers use reviews in service sectors. To that end, this paper presents a research agenda for tourism operators by examining the key issues that should be considered when addressing the phenomenon of online reviews. Specifically, the issues are as follows: What are tourist user motivations for posting online reviews (e. g. assisting others, self-promotion, seeking to negotiate a better deal with the operator) ? What online platforms do tourism operators need to monitor for such reviews (e. g. tourism-specific sites such as Trip Advisor, search engine sites such as Google) ? Are consumers more likely to post positive or negative reviews? Interestingly, there is a suggestion in the literature that positive reviews tend to prevail far more so, than negative reviews online (e. g. East, Hammond and Wright, 2007). Are service providers ‘listening’ and changing their operational processes, particularly regarding negative reviews? If positive reviews serve as credible and influential sources of information about the tourism product, how is the tourism provider including such reviews in corporate/marketing communications? For example, to what extent is a positive review being promoted on the company’s website / in advertising materials? What are the implications for the consumer decision-making process (e. g. the relative importance of tourism reviews for well-known tourist brands versus newly established offerings) ? Are online reviews serving to dilute the perception of the tourism brand’s value...|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been a lot of talk about {{consumer}} empowerment through new information and communication technologies. Corporate captains of marketing, Wired Magazine’s neo-libertarian techno-utopians, marketing consultants of the digital economy and many marketing academics agree that we all have more choices, more information, more entertainment, more transparency, and lower prices thanks to Amazon, Facebook, Youtube, and all the rest. We are liberated from the burdens of material ownership, free to access digital objects and services in ways that satisfy our needs in highly targeted and efficient ways. The empowerment through technology chorus is so loud and cohesive that we generally take the message for granted. And in some limited respect, consumers may feel empowered when shopping on Amazon. com or in the malls with their iPhones on hand. But let us be very clear about the idea of empowerment that is promoted by the cheerleaders of what Jodi Dean (2005) calls communicative capitalism. Real empowerment, so much should be clear, will never be “granted” to consumers by those in economic (and thus political) power. In the final analysis – and putting aside for a moment the fact that even empowered consumers are still interpellated first and foremost as subjects of consumption – the ideal of the <b>empowered</b> <b>consumer</b> (rational, enlightened, informed, restrained, un-manipulable) is completely antithetical to the needs of capital and the marketing regime within consumer capitalism. Therefore, any call for actual consumer empowerment would automatically be a radical demand and an insurgent claim aimed at undermining and replacing capital’s power to dominate the consumer totally. In the end, it is important to recognize that any technology employed by marketing today becomes a technology of enclosure (even if never completely successful), which permits empowerment only in a version sanction by capital. That is why marketing (and capital more generally [see Lazzarato, 2004]) today is biopolitical. It wants to govern life completely while appearing to not govern at all. In this chapter we argue that new technologies in contemporary marketing management are best thought of as technologies of enclosure. On the one hand, marketing encloses the subject as individualized and individuated consumer. On the other, marketing aims to enclose (ie., capture, make proprietary, appropriate) what is common or collectively produced or cherished by individuals as inalienable expressions of personal identity and agency. At the same time that marketing encloses, it operates ideologically, although not in the classical Marxist sense of creating a false consciousness. Rather, the challenge for marketers is to enclose and capture the subject and the common while appearing not to do any of these things. By accepting as non-ideological terms such as choice, identity, fulfillment, empowerment, enrichment, collaboration, creativity and so on, marketers and consumers alike choose to believe, just as anyone sensible would believe, that new techniques and technologies of enclosure are really just good marketing practice aimed at value creation and delivery, not customer domination and exploitation. We should remember that an atmosphere of distrust has accompanied the development of marketing from the beginning and marketers have long been suspected of being professional manipulators, devising salacious techniques and technologies with which to incite, manipulate and exploit consumer desire and anxiety. As Packard put it fifty years ago, “[T]hese depth manipulators are in their operations beneath the surface of conscious life, starting to acquire a power of persuasion that is becoming a matter of justifiable public scrutiny and concern” (1957, pp. 9 - 10). More recent popular indictments of marketing include Adam Curtis’s documentaries on The Century of the Self, Naomi Klein’s No Logo (2000), and the BBC series The Men Who Makes Us Spend (presented by Jacques Peretti). Criticism of marketers is compounded by widespread consumer cynicism regarding the genuineness of marketing messages (see Gabriel and Lang, 1995). Interestingly, the emerging generation of online marketers– typically referred to as digital or social media marketers – see marketing’s crisis of legitimacy directly tied to what it considers the corporate, top-down marketing methods devised in the 1970 s and 1980 s and designed to discipline and control consumers. For a new generation of tech-savvy marketers, imbued with a solid dose of techno-libertarian ideals of independence and a frontier mentality that rejects top-down authority and bureaucracy in favor of self-organizing systems, radical autonomy and freely collaborative networks, a dramatic shift in mindset was needed in the age of participatory media and Big Data. In a radical turn propagated, for example, by prominent social media marketing experts like Solis (2010) and Stratten (2010), marketing has to be ‘un’-done. The term ‘un-marketing’ rises to prominence in the consulting literature and offers a reframing of marketing that rejects corporate-controlled top-down techniques, and favours horizontal, collaborative, and participatory customer engagement (Kutcher, 2010, Stratten, 2010, 2014). In this context, the idea of online customer communities gains popularity because it provides a fantasy of restructuring marketplace relations according to principles of co-creation, sovereignty, equality, and sharing. More recently, what we call Big Data marketing is framed according to similar registers where data magnetizes consumers and marketers to a shared ethos of the “opt-in” economy (Godin, 1999). Big Data marketers – at least in the version propagated by Google’s Hal Varian, for example – pose innocuously enough as personal recommendation and consulting agents for consumers who in return for giving up personal information receive ever more relevant, valuable, and desired information, goods and services (Zuboff, 2015). Who would not like such a deal that appears to be based on liberal ideals of good intentions on all sides and the equal distribution of costs and benefits, even as companies manage communities and customer data not on behalf of consumers but on behalf of corporate profit. In sum, new marketing technologies – from blogs to communities to surveillance-based collaborative filtering and recommender systems – no matter how invasive, ever-present and insidious, have been framed by technology-driven marketers as democratizing and equalizing forces reshaping the contemporary marketplace in favor of the consumer. Customer and brand communities are happy places of collaboration and collective value creation governed by an ethos of mutual respect, sharing and dispersed control. Big Data Marketing, which aspires to intensifying consumer surveillance and control (Zuboff, 2015), is often presented as part of the contemporary ethos of collaborative ‘in-this-together-ness’ and collective support structures between companies and consumers. Marketers are asked to employ Big Data to better understand, assist, support and connect with customers; the technology magnetizing both exchange parties to a fantasy of better products, better choices, better experiences, better prices, better service and generally happier lives. To live in a world where companies strain to innovate and please consumers, all we need to do in return is give companies complete access to our personal information. Such a request makes sense to a generation of marketing professionals and consumers that have grown up with Google, Facebook and Amazon tracking its every move. In the next section we explore critically new marketing technologies such as online customer communities and Big Data, and possession of digital objects as consumer lock in.. We suggest that these technologies are technologies of Biopolitical Marketing. They aspire to enclose all forms of life for profit. We suggest that marketing innovation is now structured according to the imperative of biopolitical marketing: the making, valorizing and enclosing of all forms and expressions of life...|$|E
40|$|New services, like {{fabrication}} spaces, 3 D printer rentals {{and virtual}} marketplaces, {{have made it}} easier for <b>empowered</b> <b>consumers</b> to co-create innovative products without almost any involvement of traditional companies. Adopting a consumer-grounded view, this work takes a step forward from the existing service literature by investigating the link between psychological motives and happiness in co-creation. Specifically, the study measures how community affiliation, personal growth, and utilitarian motives are predictors of subjective well-being. The results illustrate that community affiliation and personal growth motives predict high scores of subjective well-being, while utilitarian motives do not. In addition, <b>empowered</b> <b>consumers</b> who co-create with others are happier than consumers who create alone. This indicates that direct interactions are not only a powerful platform for service co-creation, but are also predictors of subjective well-being. We discuss the implications for traditional companies and for decision makers regarding the benefits offered by digital fabrication services...|$|R
40|$|How can {{unsatisfied}} consumers mobilize to gain {{attention and}} obtain the “desired offer” from a firm? How the questioned firm may react to these demanding consumers? We develop {{answers to these}} questions drawing on a qualitative analysis of a few selected web based fans’ communities. Our analysis relies on the consumer power and working consumer theoretical perspectives, with the aim to examine the effect of web based communities on consumer empowerment and to propose a conceptual framework useful to describe the interaction process between <b>empowered</b> <b>consumers</b> and firms. Our discussion highlights different patterns of interactions between frustrated, agentic consumers, organized in communities, and firms. We conclude by illustrating how firms, forced to deal with this new countervailing power, may benefit from the engagement of <b>empowered</b> <b>consumers,</b> either by interacting on actual co-creation projects or by co-opting them and exploiting their creative force in order to regain control over the market...|$|R
40|$|Globalization {{has created}} new {{consumer}} needs and wants, {{and resulted in}} consumer confusion regarding the increasing complexity of products and services. This has stimulated global interest in educating and <b>empowering</b> <b>consumers.</b> The UK government has made a very ambitious commitment {{to ensure that the}} framework for consumer empowerment and support is {{at the level of the}} best in the world by 2008. The government, many consumer organizations and regulators believe that <b>empowered</b> <b>consumers</b> are key to the success of competitive markets. Two national strategies to co-ordinate activities in the UK have been developed by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) and the Financial Services Authority (FSA). The OFT consumer education strategy aims to deliver targeted, effective consumer education by increasing co-ordination and making the best use of available resources. The FSA is leading a financial capability strategy designed to deliver change to improve the UK's financial capability. Both strategies share a vision of educated and confident consumers making informed choices about the products and services they buy, and both aim to <b>empower</b> vulnerable <b>consumers.</b> Given the global interest and the development of national strategies, it is useful to consider what is meant by the term consumer empowerment. Is there a shared view of consumer empowerment internationally? Does the education of <b>consumers</b> result in <b>empowered</b> <b>consumers?</b> To what extent do the national strategies address the empowerment of vulnerable, disadvantaged, excluded or susceptible consumers? These questions will be addressed in this article which reviews the global context for the consumer education and empowerment agenda and considers key UK developments, with particular reference to the needs of vulnerable consumers. The study found that the language of consumer empowerment is gaining prominence in policy and strategy documents at the highest levels internationally in the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development and the European Community, and nationally in the UK...|$|R
