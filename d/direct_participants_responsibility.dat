5000|$|Unlike HKD CHATS, the {{clearing}} house for US dollar (USD) CHATS is a commercial bank, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC). In addition to obtaining intraday repos for payment settlement, participating banks may also obtain intraday liquidity via an overdraft facility provided by HSBC. Banks in Hong Kong {{are not required}} to participate in USD CHATS; they may choose to join as <b>Direct</b> <b>Participants</b> or Indirect <b>Participants.</b> <b>Direct</b> <b>Participants</b> maintain USD settlement accounts with HSBC for payment transactions in CHATS. Indirect Participants must conduct their payment transactions through <b>Direct</b> <b>Participants.</b> Additionally, a membership category called Indirect CHATS Users exists where its banks also conduct their payment transactions through <b>Direct</b> <b>Participants.</b> [...] The volume of transactions in USD CHATS in 2007, in raw number of transactions, totaled at 2,121,058. [...] The total value of all transactions conducted in the same year was about USD 2,127 billion. [...] As of 28 December 2015, USD CHATS has 100 <b>Direct</b> <b>Participant</b> member banks, 24 Indirect Participant member banks, 87 Indirect CHATS User member banks, and 8 Third Party User member banks.|$|R

50|$|TARGET2 {{is also an}} interbank RTGS {{payment system}} for the {{clearing}} of cross-border transfers in the eurozone. Participants in the system are either direct or indirect. <b>Direct</b> <b>participants</b> hold an RTGS account and have access to real-time information and control tools. They are responsible for all payments sent from or received on their accounts by themselves or any indirect participants operating through them. Indirect participation means that payment orders are always sent to and received from the system via a <b>direct</b> <b>participant,</b> with only the relevant <b>direct</b> <b>participant</b> having a legal relationship with the Eurosystem. Finally, bank branches and subsidiaries can choose to participate in TARGET2 as multi-addressee access or addressable BICs (Bank Identifier Code).|$|R
50|$|CHAPS {{is used by}} twenty <b>direct</b> <b>participants</b> {{including}} the Bank of England and over 4,500 indirect participants (who process transactions via agency arrangements with <b>direct</b> <b>participants).</b> In its first year of operation, average daily transactions numbered 7,000 with an annual value of £5 billion sterling. In 2004, twenty years later, average daily transactions numbered 130,000 with an annual value of £300 billion sterling. In 2010 there were 32 million CHAPS transactions totalling over £61 trillion, down from £73 trillion in 2008.|$|R

5000|$|Euro CHATS is {{structured}} similarly to USD CHATS. Its clearing house {{is also a}} commercial bank, Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong). Participating banks may obtain intraday liquidity via an overdraft facility provided by Standard Chartered Bank. Like USD CHATS, banks in Hong Kong {{are not required to}} participate in Euro CHATS. Euro CHATS has two categories of membership, <b>Direct</b> <b>Participants</b> and Indirect CHATS Users; they function {{in the same manner as}} the categories in USD CHATS.

30|$|From {{the very}} {{beginning}} and throughout the project ethical and legal questions should be addressed, such as {{the privacy of the}} <b>participants,</b> <b>responsibilities</b> and data ownership. In NDS participants are observed for a long period by data acquisition systems including video cameras, and data may also be gathered from the environment and other road users. It should be clear that these are not trivial issues. Moreover, in a European context a NDS project has to deal with different regulations and legislation in the member states.|$|R

30|$|There is {{only one}} <b>direct</b> <b>participant</b> in event-existentials; this is either the actor if the process is intransitive or the goal or range if the process is transitive.

40|$|If a ligand binds with unequal {{affinity}} to {{two distinct}} states of a protein, then the equilibrium {{between the two}} states becomes {{a function of the}} concentration of the ligand. A necessary consequence is that the ligand must also affect the forward and/or reverse rate constants for transition between the two states. For an enzyme or transport protein with such a transition as a slow step in the catalytic cycle, the overall rate also becomes a function of ligand concentration. These conclusions are independent {{of whether or not the}} ligand is a <b>direct</b> <b>participant</b> in the reaction. If it is a <b>direct</b> <b>participant,</b> then the kinetic effect arising from the principle of linked functions is distinct from the direct catalytic effect. These principles suffice to account for the biphasic response of the hydrolytic activity of ATP-driven ion pumps to the concentration of ATP, without the need to invoke more than one ATP binding site per catalytic center...|$|R

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} the development education and exchange {{activities of the}} Dutch development organization Edukans with its longstanding experience in the “Going Global” program among secondary schools in The Netherlands. Based on a survey with 186 <b>direct</b> <b>participants</b> in the foreign exchange program and 608 schoolmates at 126 secondary schools, a detailed analysis is made of differences in knowledge, attitudes, and behavior with respect to international cooperation, and tolerance regarding ethnic minorities. To guarantee unbiased impact assessment, the same data is collected among 276 students of a comparison group. Propensity score-matching techniques are used for data analysis, controlling for intrinsic differences among the three groups. Results show that international exchange programs have a significant positive impact on all four dimensions of societal support of the <b>direct</b> <b>participants</b> compared to their schoolmates. Only knowledge and attitudes changes are registered in the scores of the schoolmates compared to the comparison group. These outcomes remain robust when corrected for individual and school characteristics, parental background, and political preferences, and when unobserved heterogeneity is included...|$|R
