One of the mechanism how to prevent the spread of the conflict is the system of multilateral cooperation. Peacekeeping operations are one of the instruments for conflict settlement. Beside the system of United Nations in past years occurs another structure that could be used for peacekeeping missions. For example we can use regional organizations. Many literatures is focused on UN system and its work, fewer of them are concerning the fact of regional organization and just few of them are related to the <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> between UN and regional organizations. This is the vacancy these papers want to address. Cooperation is the main factor studying in this thesis. To be able to analyze the <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> we have to take in consideration several different fields of international relations.

40|$|Abstract. In recent years, {{numerous}} {{countries around}} the world have continually devoted substantial efforts to the biotechnology industry. Despite its endeavors over two decades, Taiwan’s biotechnology industry has not yet made any remarkable achievements. In this study, influential <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> in the biotechnology industry are discussed from the perspectives <b>of</b> cluster <b>cooperation</b> and interaction. Using the analytic hierarchy process and quantitative results obtained from in-depth expert interview questionnaires, the weights <b>of</b> various influential <b>factors</b> are investigated and analyzed, which could provide a reference for future research and resource allocations. The influential <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> cluster <b>cooperation</b> in Taiwan’s biotechnology industry can be categorized into four major factors and sixteen sub-factors. The results indicate that among all <b>of</b> the <b>factors</b> that impact cluster cooperation in the biotechnology industry, “enterprise innovation ability” is the most critical. The innovation capacity of cooperative partners is always considered a priority in cluster cooperation among enterprises, whereas research and development (R&D), personnel quality, and the R&D environment are the most crucial sub-factors within the primary dimension of enterprise innovation ability. This finding is consistent with the fact that a biotechnology product is closely bound to innovative R&D, from its initial development stage to the eventual clinical launch. <b>Factors</b> <b>of</b> secondary importance include business management ability and government resource utilization, which suggests that the principal activities associated with cluster cooperation in the biotechnology industry depend heavily on an enterprise’s business management ability and are inextricably linked to government resource utilization.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to map out}} multi-agency {{partnerships}} in the UK information assurance (UKIA) network in the UK. Design/methodology/approach – The paper surveyed members of the UKIA community and achieved a 52 percent response rate (n= 104). The paper used a multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) technique to map the multi-agency cooperation space and factor analysis and ordinary least squares regression to identify predictive <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> frequency. Qualitative data were also solicited via the survey and interviews with security managers. Findings – Via the quantitative measures, the paper locates gaps in the multi-agency cooperation network and identifies predictors <b>of</b> <b>cooperation.</b> The data indicate an over-crowded cybersecurity space, problems in apprehending perpetrators, and poor business case justifications for SMEs as potential inhibitors to cooperation, while concern over certain cybercrimes and perceptions of organisational effectiveness were identified as motivators. Practical implications – The {{data suggest that the}} neo-liberal rationality that has been evoked in other areas of crime control is also evident in the control of cybercrimes. The paper concludes divisions exist between the High Policing rhetoric of the UK's Cyber Security Strategy and the (relatively) Low Policing cooperation outcomes in “on the ground” cyber-policing. If the cooperation outcomes advocated by the UK Cyber Security Strategy are to be realised, UKIA organisations must begin to acknowledge and remedy gaps and barriers in cooperation.

They have allowed for the preparation of template process models (Reference Models) for selected action coordination methods in the supply chain. 	Conclusions: The result of the work is a prepared model as well as its description in the use of IDEF 0. The presented model is a demonstrative model. The proposed reference model makes it possible to define the parameters of a selected mechanism of coordination of actions, and forms a basis for affecting the progression of the process through an analysis of values of identified parameters. The parameterization of elements constitutes the foundation for the monitoring of the process via 1) unambiguous identification of the object of monitoring and 2) analysis of different variants of the progression of the process...|$|R
40|$|Research on Water Utilization Cooperation between Semarang City and Semarang Regency Year 2013 - 2015 aims to {{understand}} {{the form of the}} clean water utilization cooperation done by both regions, as well as the realization <b>of</b> the <b>cooperation</b> in 2013 - 2015. Additionally, there will be explanation about the background <b>of</b> the <b>cooperation,</b> the motivating <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cooperation,</b> and obstacles faced in the cooperation. This research uses descriptive qualitative method with data collection techniques such as interviews as the primary data and documents as secondary data. Informants in this study are the Semarang Regency Government and Semarang City 2 ̆ 7 s regional water utility company. 2 Based on the research that has been done, it can be concluded that the cooperation in the utilization of clean water is the second time between Semarang Regency and Semarang City after previously conducted in 2004. The cooperation was established in 2013 and in a period of 25 years with the contribution of water. Realization <b>of</b> the <b>cooperation</b> in 2013 - 2015 did not achieve the targets agreed upon by the two regions. Inter-regional cooperation is not running optimally, there are still many {{things that need to be}} fixed in its management. But behind it all there is still good faith from both areas to solve existing problems...|$|R
40|$|Motivation – {{to explore}} the {{applicability}} <b>of</b> a Human <b>Factors</b> methodology for the investigation of fratricide. Research approach – The EAST methodology was used to analyse an incident of fratricide and its ability {{to explore the}} Famous Five of Fratricide (F 3) model was investigated. Findings/Design – the analysis revealed that EAST was able to provide explicit discussion of the Famous Five of Fratricide (F 3) models five causal <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> communication, <b>cooperation,</b> coordination, schemata and situation awareness. Research limitations/Implications – the research explored a single case study and as such is couched at the initial phases of investigation. Originality/Value – the analysis provides a contribution to the knowledge urrounding fratricide both with respect to the novel application of the EAST methodology to an incident of fratricide, and also the causal factors identified by EAST within the fratricide incident. Take away message – the EAST methodology provides an innovative way of exploring causality in incidents of fratricide<br/...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{determining}} <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> science-based <b>cooperation</b> {{in the case}} of small and micro firms. In this research, we propose an analyt-ical framework based on the resource-based view of the firm and we identify a set of organisational characteristics, which we classify as in-ternal, external and structural factors. Each factor can be linked to at least one reason, from the firm’s point of view, to cooperate with uni-versities and public research centres. Each reason can, in turn, be used as an indicator of a firm’s organisational needs or organisational capac-ities. In order to validate the theoretical model, we estimate a logistic regression that models the propensity to participate in science-based cooperation activities within a sample of 285 small and micro firms lo-cated in Barcelona. The results show the key role played by the absorp-tive capacity of new and small companies. Key Words: science-based cooperation, determinants, absorptive capacity, small and micro firms jel Classification: l 26, o 3...|$|R
