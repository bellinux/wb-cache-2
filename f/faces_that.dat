Having been told while filming Angels with Dirty <b>Faces</b> <b>that</b> he would be doing a scene with real machine gun bullets (a common practice in the Hollywood of the time), Cagney refused and insisted the shots be added afterwards.

The corner towerlets were removed again some time before 1603. In 1770–71, the Zytglogge was renovated by Niklaus Hebler and Ludwig Emanuel Zehnder, who refurbished the structure in order to suit the tastes of the late Baroque, giving the tower its contemporary outline.|$|E
5|$|Any {{counting}} formula involving vertices and <b>faces</b> <b>that</b> {{is valid}} for all planar graphs may be transformed by planar duality into an equivalent formula {{in which the}} roles of the vertices and faces have been swapped. Euler's formula, which is self-dual, is one example. Another given by Harary involves the handshaking lemma, according to which the sum of the degrees of the vertices of any graph equals twice the number of edges. In its dual form, this lemma states that in a plane graph, the sum of the numbers of sides of the faces of the graph equals twice the number of edges.|$|E

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War II in 1939, and with the dissolution of her third marriage, Kalep began a new business venture in the American toy market. She designed a doll named Patsie Parachute which, when thrown into the air, would fall down slowly as a parachutist would. The dolls were produced in a New York factory where Kalep herself was forced to work to sustain the business. Her health deteriorated, however, and her profits from the business were spent almost entirely on medical costs; {{she was forced to}} close the factory in 1946. She had recovered by 1950 and made a living by selling patents for toy designs to larger businesses. One of her successful designs was Scribbles Dolls—toy dolls with blank <b>faces</b> <b>that</b> could be individually decorated by children—which was inspired by the 50,000 doll heads she had left over from the closure of the Patsie Parachute factory.|$|E

25|$|In {{mathematical}} terms, {{the structure}} of a fullerene is a trivalent convex polyhedron with pentagonal and hexagonal faces. In graph theory, the term fullerene refers to any 3-regular, planar graph with all faces of size 5 or 6 (including the external face). It follows from Euler's polyhedron formula, V−E+F=2 (where V, E, F are the numbers of vertices, edges, and <b>faces),</b> <b>that</b> there are exactly 12 pentagons in a fullerene and V/2−10 hexagons.|$|E

The architecture is a mix of Baroque and Renaissance, which is uncommon in Mexico for the 17th century. The bell tower is Baroque and one of the tallest in the city. It has a Latin cross layout and a vaulted ceiling. The interior has been restored and contain a Churrigueresque cupola, along with 18th-century paintings such as depictions of Christ by Diego de Borgraf.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the female}} <b>faces</b> <b>that</b> {{can be seen in}} Giger's early work are based on Li's face. Arguably the most famous {{paintings}} depicting Li (and the only ones doing so explicitly) are two eponymous paintings, that is, Li I and Li II both 1974, two of Giger's most well-known and recognizable works. Allegedly, Li was shocked when she first saw the painting (Li I) that was supposed to represent her and proceeded to break the frame and tear its fabric. Giger consequently reconstructed the torn painting.|$|E

25|$|Belying his {{background}} in art {{music and the}} avant-garde, Cale had enjoyed and followed rock music from a young age; {{on a visit to}} Britain in 1965, he procured records by The Kinks, The Who and The Small <b>Faces</b> <b>that</b> remained unavailable in the United States. Early that year, he co-founded The Velvet Underground with Lou Reed, recruiting his flatmate Angus MacLise and Reed's college friend Sterling Morrison to complete the initial line-up. Cale ultimately left the band in September 1968, owing in part to creative disagreements with Reed.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, Derek de Solla Price {{concluded}} from gear {{settings and}} inscriptions on the mechanism's <b>faces</b> <b>that</b> {{it was made}} about 87 BC and lost {{only a few years}} later. Jacques Cousteau and associates visited the wreck in 1976 and recovered coins dated between 76 and 67 BC. The mechanism's advanced state of corrosion has made it impossible to perform an accurate compositional analysis, but it is believed that the device was made of a low-tin bronze alloy (of approximately 95% copper, 5% tin). Its instructions were composed in Koine Greek.|$|E
25|$|A {{polygonal}} mesh {{is composed}} {{of a set of}} vertices, edges, and <b>faces</b> <b>that</b> specify the shape of a polyhedral object in 3D space. The surfaces of the phantom are defined by a large amount of polygonal meshes, most commonly triangles. The polygonal mesh has three remarkable advantages in developing whole-body phantoms. Firstly, mesh surfaces depicting human anatomy can be conveniently obtained from real patient images or commercial human anatomy mesh models. Secondly, the polygonal mesh-based phantom has considerable flexibility in adjusting and fine-tuning its geometry, allowing the simulation of very complex anatomies. Thirdly, many commercial computer aided design (CAD) software, such as Rhinoceros, AutoCAD, Visualization Toolkit (VTK), provide built-in functions able to rapidly convert polygonal mesh into NURBS.|$|E

25|$|A {{hand axe}} (or handaxe) is a prehistoric stone tool with two <b>faces</b> <b>that</b> is the longest-used tool in human history. It is usually made from flint or chert. It is {{characteristic}} of the lower Acheulean and middle Palaeolithic (Mousterian) periods. Its technical name (biface) {{comes from the fact}} that the archetypical model is generally bifacial Lithic flake and almond-shaped (amygdaloidal). Hand axes tend to be symmetrical along their longitudinal axis and formed by pressure or percussion. The most common hand axes have a pointed end and rounded base, which gives them their characteristic shape, and both faces have been knapped to remove the natural cortex, at least partially. Hand axes are a type of the somewhat wider biface group of two-faced tools or weapons.|$|E
25|$|Tiwanaku monumental {{architecture}} {{is characterized by}} large stones of exceptional workmanship. In contrast to the masonry style of the later Inca, Tiwanaku stone architecture usually employs rectangular ashlar blocks laid in regular courses. Their monumental structures were frequently fitted with elaborate drainage systems. The drainage systems of the Akapana and Pumapunku structures include conduits composed of red sandstone blocks held together by ternary (copper/arsenic/nickel) bronze architectural cramps. The I-shaped architectural cramps of the Akapana were created by cold hammering of ingots. In contrast, the cramps of the Pumapunku were created by pouring molten metal into I-shaped sockets. The blocks have flat <b>faces</b> <b>that</b> {{do not need to}} be fitted upon placement because the grooves make it possible for the blocks to be shifted by ropes into place. The main architectural appeal of the site comes from the carved images and designs on some of these blocks, carved doorways, and giant stone monoliths.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes, when recalling word pairs, {{there is}} an {{intrusion}}. An intrusion is an error that participants make when they attempt to recall a word based on a cue of that word pair. Intrusions tend to have either semantic attributes {{in common with the}} correct word not recalled or have been previously studied in another word pair on the current list or a previously studied list or were close in time to the cue item. When two items are similar, an intrusion may occur. Professor Kahana and Marieke Vugt at the University of Pennsylvania examined the effects of face similarity for face-name associations. In the first experiment, they wanted to determine if performance of recall would vary with the number of faces in the study set that were similar to the cue face. Faces were similar if the radius of the faces were within a range. The number of faces within a radius is called a neighborhood density. They found that the recall of a name to face exhibited a lower accuracy and slower reaction time for faces with a greater neighborhood density. The more similarity that two faces have, the greater the probability for interference between the two faces. When cued with face A, name B may be recalled if face A and B are similar, which would signify that an intrusion has occurred. The probability of correct recall came from the number of <b>faces</b> <b>that</b> had other similar faces.|$|E
