There are examples in satyric drama and Aristophanes, {{but these are}} often paratragic in tone and impassioned. [...] The base metrical scheme is: ‿ — — ‿ —, although any of the long syllables may be resolved and {{either of the two}} shorts may be replaced by a long (<b>drag-in</b> where the first is replaced, drag-out where the second is replaced, and double drag where both are replaced).|$|E
40|$|The {{axisymmetric}} flow of a thin {{liquid film}} is {{considered for the}} problem of a vertically rotating disk that is partially immersed in a liquid bath. A model for the fully three-dimensional free-boundary problem of the rotating disk, that drags a thin film out of the bath is set up. From this, a dimension-reduced extended lubrication approximation that includes the meniscus region is derived. This problem constitutes a generalization of the classic drag-out and <b>drag-in</b> problem {{to the case of}} axisymmetric flow. The resulting nonlinear fourth-order partial differential equation for the film profile is solved numerically using a finite element scheme. For a range of parameters steady states are found and compared to asymptotic solutions. Patterns of the film profile, as a function of immersion depth and angular velocity are discussed.

40|$|A strong need islelt by a {{practical}} plater {{for a black}} chrome bath which can be operated around the ambient temperature (30 °C) and at normally employed current densities and preferably not associated with any necessity of controlling the catalyst concentration. In the work now reported, experiments were carried out on the solubility of calcium fluoride gt 30 °C in chromic acid solutions with a concentration range of. 200 - 425 g 1 I. Barium hydroxide was introduced in adequate quantities to desulphate chromic acid and also to counteract any <b>drag-in</b> of sulphate. Hullcell experiments were carried out at 23 " and 31 °C {{in order to assess}} approximately the cunent density range over which black chromium deposition was possible. This was followed by experiments in plating to study the effects of different parameters like chromic acid concentration, current density. temperature and duration of deposition on the nature of finish and deposition...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study which focused on the identification and testing of technologies for removing iron and copper from chromium plating solutions. Initially, a literature review was conducted to identify the most viable technologies. Two technologies were then selected for testing: an electrodialytic membrane unit and a porous pot. Tests were conducted on contrived baths with metal concentrations initially in the range of 10 to 15 g/l. The results showed a superior performance by the membrane technology in terms of iron and copper removal. Also, the membrane technology produced a much smaller volume of residual waste. These test results can be used to aid metal finishers in selecting and sizing chrome purification units. Several case studies are examined which document use of purification technologies. BACKGROUND Chromium plating solutions become contaminated with various metallic impurities including trivalent chromium, iron, copper, nickel, aluminum, and zinc. Trivalent chromium contamination results from the plating process when the anode surface area is insufficiently sized in comparison to the cathode area. Other metallic contaminants are introduced by <b>drag-in,</b> cathodic etching, and attack on racks, fixtures and bus bars (figure 1). Various defects in chromium plated deposits are attributed to metallic impurities. However, researchers, experts, and quality control departments have differing opinions as to the tolerable levels of these contaminants...|$|E
