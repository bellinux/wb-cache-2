40|$|For many reasons, {{reflecting}} {{on the life of}} Nelson Mandela is a precarious exercise. If Mandela is a symbol of the resilience of the human spirit under trying conditions, he is also a symbol that is appropriated in various ways – helpful and unhelpful – by various people. This article explores some of the unhelpful ways in which the name and person of Nelson Mandela is invoked. In particular, the article looks at the hagiographical orientation of several reflections on Mandela, cautioning how some of these may have an effect less noble than originally intended. Accordingly, the article asks: How much can the symbol of Mandela bear? How much more can Mandela give? The logic and rationale of Mandela hagiography is explored. Following his death, there has been an explosion of interest in the life and symbol that <b>is</b> <b>Nelson</b> <b>Mandela.</b> Mandela literature, including multi-media, is on the rise. If the symbol of Mandela is in danger of being ‘cannibalised’, there is also a danger of relegating Mandela to an ahistorical mythical figure. The solution lies in at least two area, namely, the increment of alternative Mandela narratives and the introduction of more critical Mandela narratives. In this regard, Mandela’s own self-understanding as captured in his reflections about his life offer several clues which are explored in this article. [URL]...|$|E

This {{research}} aims to {{find out}} how the attitudinal intonation is constructed by the speaker. Study of document becomes the technique of this research. This research also takes a qualitative method in analyzing data where the data is taken from you-tube and Nelson Mandela as a main data source to be analyzed in this research. There are some steps to analyze the data. The researcher analyzed the clause construction that consists of dependent and independent clause. Then, analyzed the tonality system that consists of tone group, markedness of tonality (unmarked and marked), finiteness, and types of clause. Then, the researcher analyzed the tonicity system that consists of new and given information and also markedness of tonicity. Further, the researcher analyzed the tone system based on PRAAT system that will be connected to the attitudinal intonation based on primary stress and interpersonal context. This research was conducted within the spirit of discourse –phonology which concern with the study {{of the relationship between the}} language and the context in which is used that are attitudinal function and three primary of intonation (T 3) used by speaker where 3 T are knowing the common patterns of tonality in speaker’s speech and knowing what tonality tells about unit of information (tonality), focus of information (tonicity) and status of information (tone). Design of the research is discourse analyses in phonological persfective which is taken from one of public speeches that <b>is</b> <b>Nelson</b> <b>Mandela</b> as a president in south Africa under the title “Inauguration Speech”. The data of the research is taken from selecting a single EFL learner of spoken discourse. The data collected by video recording and converted into audio in the form of WAV then segmented using PRAAT software analysis. The data is analyzes by contextual method. The analyses process is constructed based on : (1). The division theory of information unit in the systematic functional grammar level (SFG) and intonation level by Tench, (2). The common pattern of tonality, tonicity and tone by Dorothy M chun and MAK Halliday, (3). The attitudinal intonation as found in the speech based on phonology perspective and interpersonal metafunction. The result of this analysis shows that there are different speaker’s division of message between systematic functional grammar level and intonation level. There are four elements as found in the system of tonality. Those are, there are 96 units of information independent 46 (48...|$|E
40|$|Historical Background: The Ethical Leadership Project {{came into}} being as an {{initiative}} of the national Moral Regeneration Movement (MRM), specifically after a consultative conference which was held in Stellenbosch, September 2004 with the focus on Ethical Leadership. In January 2005 an interim board was established and functioned with a twofold mandate, namely (a) that of the national MRM, and (b) that {{of the office of}} the Premier in the Western Cape. The Premier’s vision of the Moral Regeneration Movement in the Western Cape was that it should be an ideology adopted by all departments within provincial government as opposed to a provincial MRM structure. The Ethical Leadership Project was identified as the first project to be undertaken as an initiative of the MRM within the Western Cape Province. The first conference on Ethical Leadership in and through the Family took place in August 2005. An Annual General Meeting (AGM) was held as closure to the conference, in order to elect a board. The Ethical Leadership Project was launched in 2005 and is a joint research and teaching project on the building and strengthening of ethical leadership. The following institutions constitute its corporate identity: Moral Regeneration Movement (MRM), Beyers Naudé Centre for Public Theology (University of Stellenbosch), University of the Western Cape (UWC), Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT), Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) and The Office of the Premier of the Western Cape. Since the advent of South Africa’s democracy in 1994 there has been widespread conviction that, in order to give effect to a democratic constitution and particularly a bill of human rights, it is crucial to build and sustain a human rights culture. The importance of building communities and institutions where people are inspired to embody and practice the vision articulated in the constitution - people who recognize and respect the human dignity of others, with a sense of responsibility to and for others, has continuously been expressed. It <b>is</b> <b>Nelson</b> <b>Mandela</b> who during his presidency said that we need “RDP of the soul”. The question is: What is required for the formation of good South African citizens – people of good moral character who can make a contribution toward transformation in family life, schools, faith communities, businesses, political parties, the media, advocacy groups and service organizations, in the economic sector and various structures of governance? This is a question with which leadership of structures within civil society, the business sector and government has to grapple with. Nair’s views on a renewed leadership focus (which encapsulates the relevance and importance of the Ethical Leadership Project) are: “Leadership by example is not only the most pervasive but also the most enduring form of leadership. And because the world is becoming more interconnected, standards of leadership have an impact that extends around the globe. Now, as ever before, a higher standard of leadership will serve us all. ” (Nair, K 1996.
