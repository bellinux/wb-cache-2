5|$|An alloy of {{aluminium}} and gallium in pellet form added to {{water can be}} used to generate hydrogen. The process also produces alumina, but the expensive gallium, which prevents the formation of an oxide skin on the pellets, can be re-used. This has important potential implications for a hydrogen economy, as hydrogen can be produced on-site and <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> to be transported.|$|E

He offers her a golden guinea. The fairy decides that someone that miserly must be punished and compels him to {{continue}} passing out guineas to all he meets.|$|E

To derive it we <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> Lorentz's transformations equations, that is we <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> SPACE-TIME.

In other words, in physics we <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> Einstein's theory of relativity. From the asymmetrical form of the intensity of the moving charge we can derive Gauss law, Faraday's law and derive the 4 th Maxwell's equation, fictional by Maxwell and not to be derived. Kinetic energy of a charge moving at the velocity of v has two different values: in direction of motion as own kinetic energy of charge and against direction of motion of charge represents the wave energy, which charge creates in transmision medium...|$|R

5|$|As, {{according}} to Bulgarian mythology {{and some other}} traditions, tortoises were the only beings who knew {{the appearance of the}} herb and the location where it grows, such people would try to obtain the raskovnik by deceiving a tortoise. They would find a tortoise nesting site and hem it in with a fence while the tortoise is away. When it returns, the tortoise would be unable to access its eggs, so it would return with a raskovnik in order to breach the fence. Thus, the tortoise would reveal the herb and people would acquire it from the tortoise, which <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> it anymore.|$|E

Beef, unlike certain other meats, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> to be cooked through. Food-borne human {{illnesses}} are not normally found within a beef steak, though surfaces can potentially be contaminated from handling, and thus, very rare steak (seared on the outside and raw within) is generally accepted as safe.|$|E

Just as he is out of money and risks being evicted, Devushkin has a stroke of luck: his boss takes pity on him and gives him 100 rubles to buy new clothes. Devushkin pays off his debts and sends some to Dobroselova. She sends him 25 rubles back because she <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> it. The future looks bright for both of them because he can now start to save money and it may be possible for them to move in together.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, HP {{determined}} that Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architectures were approaching a processing limit at one instruction per cycle. HP researchers investigated a new architecture, later named Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC), {{that allows the}} processor to execute multiple instructions in each clock cycle. EPIC implements a form of very long instruction word (VLIW) architecture, in which a single instruction word contains multiple instructions. With EPIC, the compiler determines in advance which instructions can be executed at the same time, so the microprocessor simply executes the instructions and <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> elaborate mechanisms to determine which instructions to execute in parallel.|$|E

He does this through an inspirational speech, but Britta sees through his lies and asks him to leave. Jeff then comes clean about everything, adding that since he now has the test answers he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> the study group. As the group turns against him he leaves.|$|E
5|$|Proteins are {{essential}} to life. Cells produce new protein molecules from amino acid building blocks based on information coded in DNA. Each type of protein is a specialist that usually only performs one function, so if a cell needs to do something new, it must make a new protein. Viruses force the cell to make new proteins that the cell <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need,</b> but are needed for the virus to reproduce. Protein synthesis consists of two major steps: transcription and translation.|$|E

He convinces her that she <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> to forgive her parents for abandoning her, but she can, as an adult, see them as two regular people who made a mistake. After this, Kaira makes an effort to reconcile with her parents and also works to finish her short film.|$|E

5000|$|Plutarch {{wrote that}} demons could not feel sexual desire because they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> to procreate; his work inspiring later Remy's opinion. Thomas Aquinas {{asserted}} that demons could not experience voluptuousness or desire, and they {{only wanted to}} seduce humans {{with the purpose of}} inducing them to commit terrible sexual sins. Remy wrote that [...] "demons <b>do</b> <b>not</b> feel sexual desire inspired by beauty, because they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> it to procreate, having been created since the beginning in a predetermined number". Boguet said that demons <b>did</b> <b>not</b> know lust or voluptuousness [...] "because they are immortal and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> to have descendants, and so they also <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> to have sexual organs", so demons could make people imagine that they were having sexual relationships, but that actually <b>did</b> <b>not</b> occur.
