25|$|Passive noise {{isolation}} is essentially using {{the body of}} the earphone, either over or in the ear, as a passive earplug that simply blocks out sound. The headphone types that provide most attenuation are in-ear canal headphones and closed-back headphones, both circumaural and supra aural. Open-back and <b>earbud</b> headphones provide some passive noise isolation, but much less than the others. Typical closed-back headphones block 8 to 12dB, and in-ears anywhere from 10 to 15dB. Some models have been specifically designed for drummers, with the aim to be able to monitor the recorded sound while shutting out the sound coming directly from the drums {{at the same time as}} much as possible. Such headphones claim to reduce ambient noise by around 25dB.|$|E

2500|$|Smaller <b>earbud</b> type earpieces, which {{plugged into}} the user's ear canal, were first {{developed}} for hearing aids. They became widely used with transistor radios, which commercially appeared in 1954 {{with the introduction of}} the Regency TR-1. The most popular audio device in history, the transistor radio changed listening habits, allowing people to listen to radio anywhere. [...] The <b>earbud</b> uses either a moving iron driver or a piezoelectric crystal to produce sound. [...] The 3.5mm radio and phone connector, which is the most commonly used in portable application today, has been used at least since the Sony EFM-117J transistor radio which was released in 1964. Its popularity was reinforced with its use on the Walkman portable tape player in 1979.|$|E
2500|$|The third {{generation}} iPod Shuffle featured a polished steel attachment clip, adopting {{for the first}} time the polished steel finishing previously found only on the larger iPods, rather than the brushed aluminum used in the second-generation iPod Shuffle. It also no longer had volume or track controls on the device itself. Instead, the packaged iPod earbuds included a three-button device on the right <b>earbud</b> cord. This added the functions of changing between playlists, hearing the song title and artist of the track playing, as well as play/pause, track changes and volume control. It originally was not possible to change songs or volume with most third-party headphones, since they lacked these controls. However, since the device began playing music automatically when it was turned on, third-party headphones could still be used in [...] "autoplay" [...] mode (with no volume or playback controls), and after its release, some third-party headphones and headphone adapters began to include full support for the {{third generation}}. The official headphones contained a chip designed by Apple to control the device. DRM is not however present in the chip as there is no encryption used.|$|E
