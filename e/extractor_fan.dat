25|$|The {{following}} day, Tandy {{was working}} on his fencing foil, with the handle held in a vice. Although there was nothing touching it, the blade started to vibrate wildly. Further investigation led Tandy {{to discover that the}} <b>extractor</b> <b>fan</b> in the lab was emitting a frequency of 18.98Hz, very close to the resonant frequency of the eye given as 18Hz by NASA. This, Tandy conjectured, was why he had seen a ghostly figure—it was, he believed, an optical illusion caused by his eyeballs resonating. The room was exactly half a wavelength in length, and the desk was in the centre, thus causing a standing wave which caused the vibration of the foil.|$|E

It has a flat roof 11 cubits and 5 digits or 5.852 metres (19 feet 2 inch) above the floor. [...] above the floor there are two narrow shafts in the north and south walls (one is now filled by an <b>extractor</b> <b>fan</b> in an attempt to {{circulate}} air inside the pyramid). The purpose of these shafts is not clear: they appear to be aligned towards stars or areas of the northern and southern skies, yet one of them follows a dog-leg course through the masonry, indicating no intention to directly sight stars through them. They were long believed by Egyptologists to be [...] "air shafts" [...] for ventilation, but this idea has now been widely abandoned in favour of the shafts serving a ritualistic purpose associated with the ascension of the king’s spirit to the heavens.|$|E

40|$|Exposure to {{hazardous}} {{concentrations of}} {{volatile organic compounds}} indoors in small workshops could affect the health of workers, resulting in respirative diseases, severe intoxication or even cancer. Controlling the concentration of volatile organic compounds is required to prevent harmful conditions for workers in indoor environments. In this document, PI and fuzzy PI controllers were used to reduce hazardous indoor air benzene concentrations in small workplaces. The workshop is represented {{by means of a}} well-mixed room model. From the knowledge obtained from the model, PI and fuzzy PI controllers were designed and their performances were compared. Both controllers were able to maintain the benzene concentration within secure levels for the workers. The fuzzy PI controller performed more efficiently than the PI controller. Both approaches could be expanded to control multiple <b>extractor</b> <b>fans</b> {{in order to reduce the}} air pollution in a shorter time. The results from the comparative analysis showed that implementing a fuzzy logic PI controller is promising for assuring indoor air quality in this kind of hazardous work environment...|$|R
50|$|Condensation in {{building}} construction is an unwanted phenomenon {{as it may}} cause dampness, mold health issues, wood rot, corrosion, weakening of mortar and masonry walls, and energy penalties due to increased heat transfer. To alleviate these issues, the indoor air humidity needs to be lowered, or air ventilation in the building needs to be improved. This {{can be done in}} a number of ways, for example opening windows, turning on <b>extractor</b> <b>fans,</b> using dehumidifiers, drying clothes outside and covering pots and pans whilst cooking. Air conditioning or ventilation systems can be installed that help remove moisture from the air, and move air throughout a building. The amount of water vapour that can be stored in the air can be increased simply by increasing the temperature. However, this can be a double edged sword as most condensation in the home occurs when warm, moisture heavy air comes into contact with a cool surface. As the air is cooled, it can no longer hold as much water vapour. This leads to deposition of water on the cool surface. This is very apparent when central heating is used in combination with single glazed windows in winter.|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} the energy usage of supermarkets, in {{particular}} that of their refrigeration systems, has been investigated {{using a variety of}} approaches, such as floating pressure set points and integrating the heating and refrigeration systems. Something which has not yet attracted much attention is the energy consumption of the dry condenser fans in refrigeration systems. This is surprising as it has been shown for comparable installations that including the energy consumption of these fans when optimizing the system efficiency was beneficial. To address this deficit, _COP_ maximization has been compared to optimizing the Coefficient of System Performance (_COSP_). The simple refrigeration system used for this investigation was based on a commercially available R 404 A/CO 2 system comprising the basic components, with the condenser having <b>extractor</b> <b>fans.</b> The results show that, when the outdoor temperature is below about 15 °C, there is no observable difference between these two approaches. However, when the ambient temperature increases beyond this threshold, the control method which optimizes _COSP_ is significantly better for part load conditions. This indicates that maximizing the _COP_ can lead to a sub-optimal system in terms of energy consumption under part load conditions. When the refrigeration system is at its full load point, however, both approaches produce similar results again...|$|R
40|$|Evaporative cooling systems using a {{combination}} of evaporative pads and <b>extractor</b> <b>fans</b> require greenhouses to be hermetic. The greatest concentration of greenhouses in the world is located in southeast Spain, but these tend not to be hermetic structures and consequently can only rely on fogging systems as evaporative cooling techniques. Evaporative cooling boxes provide an alternative to such systems. Using a low-speed wind tunnel, the present work has compared the performance of this system with four pads of differing geometry and thickness manufactured by two different companies. The results obtained show that the plastic packing in the cooling unit produces a pressure drop of 11. 05 Pa at 2 m·s− 1, which is between 51. 27 % and 94. 87 % lower than that produced by the cellulose pads. This pressure drop was not influenced by increases in the water flow. The evaporative cooling boxes presented greater saturation efficiency at the same flow, namely 82. 63 %, as opposed to an average figure of 65 % for the cellulose pads; and also had a lower specific consumption of water, at around 3. 05 L·h− 1 ·m− 2 ·°C− 1. Consequently, we conclude that evaporative cooling boxes are a good option for cooling non-hermetic greenhouses such as those most frequently used in the Mediterranean basin.

40|$|In hot {{and humid}} climates thermal comfort can become a problem to the {{occupants}} of many residential buildings especially {{when they are not}} equipped with air-conditioning system. This paper presents outcomes of an ongoing research work to investigate thermal comfort level in a naturally ventilated residential house in Malaysia using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. Actual measurements of the temperature distribution, relative humidity and air flow pattern were conducted. CFD simulations on the model of the house allow us to visualize the temperature distribution and air flow pattern and velocity in the house. The thermal comfort in the house was found to be well outside the limits specified by ASHRAE standards. CFD simulation was used to investigate the effects of using a ceiling fan installed {{in the middle of the}} hall section and rotating at 150 RPM. It was found that the fan produced swirling flow pattern in the hall section resulting in a more uniform temperature distribution inside the house. However, there is no significant improvement in the thermal comfort level in the house. Results of CFD simulations also show that the use of small <b>extractor</b> <b>fans</b> installed on the front and back walls has no significant effects on the thermal comfort level in the house. Although the mechanical ventilation devices did not help improve the thermal comfort in the house being studied, the CFD simulation results can be used by building designers and engineers to further improved the level of thermal comfort in residential houses in {{hot and humid}} climates that are naturally ventilated...|$|R
50|$|The {{possibility}} of a device that produces frequency that causes vibration of the eyeballs — and therefore distortion of vision — was apparently confirmed {{by the work of}} engineer Vic Tandy while attempting to demystify a “haunting” in his laboratory in Coventry.
