5|$|By {{length of}} story, Planetarian is the {{shortest}} of Key's games. Excluding the opening and ending sequences, there are 16 parts to the story; the first half is set within the planetarium while the latter half is set outside in the ruined city where the planetarium resides. The novel takes four hours and forty minutes to complete on auto play. After the game has been completed at least once, two new options appear on the title screen. The <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> feature that allows the player to view twenty images of CG artwork observed in the game. The second option allows the player to listen to eight of the nine music tracks featured in the game.|$|E

Different means of {{crossing}} the river in Cubzac have historically been used, from pontoon bridges and horse-powered ferries to steel and concrete bridges. Part of a vibrant wine region, Cubzac has several wine castles, including the Terrefort castle. It has developed its own sparkling wine, {{in what is now}} called the Café de Paris. The limestone quarries of Cubzac supplied for the typical white constructions found in Bordeaux and its region.

5|$|For {{the events}} {{surrounding}} 572, the most exhaustive source available is Paul the Deacon's Historia Langobardorum, {{a history of the}} Lombard nation up to 744. The book was finished {{in the last two decades}} of the 8th century, after the Lombard Kingdom had been conquered by the Franks in 774. Because of the apparent presence in the work of many fragments preserved from Lombard oral tradition, Paul's work has been often interpreted as a tribute to a vanishing culture. Among these otherwise lost traditions stands the tale of Alboin's death. According to Herwig Wolfram, what Paul deals with is an example of how nationally vital events were personalized to make them easier to preserve in the collective memory. Even later than the Historia Langobardorum, but possibly using earlier lost sources, are the last two primary sources to speak about Helmichis: the anonymous Historia Langobardorum Codicis Gothani and the Liber Pontificalis Ecclesiae Ravennatis written by Andreas Agnellus. The <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> brief Christianizing version of the Origo that was made in the first decade of the 9th century from a Carolingian point of view. The second was written in the 830s by a priest from Ravenna and is a history of the bishops who held the see of Ravenna through the ages. Agnellus' passage on Alboin and Rosamund is mostly derived from Paul and little else.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{makes an}} {{appointment}} {{at the clinic}} and pays for it by pawning their television. This only frustrates {{the rest of the}} Simpsons as he takes them to the scheduled appointment. In the waiting room, they claim the family doesn't have a problem and are silenced by Homer. Dr. Monroe encourages them to express their unhappiness with a series of exercises. The <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> drawing exercise, which he encourages them to draw out the source of their problems. Most of the Simpsons vent out their anger by drawing Homer as they see him. When Dr. Monroe observes it, he realizes that Homer is likely the source of their issues in the family. This is evident when he proves his own inattentive nature in being lost in the exercise and having the family view him as such, including being too strict as a disciplinarian. The other methods in getting the family {{to talk to each other}} in a normal matter fail. Dr. Monroe finally takes matters into his own hands and sends them all to a generator room, allowing them to deliver electric shocks to each other. The family shocks one another to the point of causing a power drain on the city. Unable to help them, Dr. Monroe gives the Simpsons double their money back. With a fresh sense of family unity, they use the money to buy a new television set.|$|E
5|$|Seals from Tell Brak and Nabada {{dated to}} the pre-Akkadian kingdom, {{revealed}} {{the use of}} four-wheeled wagons and war carriages. Excavation in area FS recovered clay models of equids and wagons dated to the Akkadian and post-Akkadian periods. The models provide information about the types of wagons used during that period (2350–2000 BC), and they include four wheeled vehicles and two types of two wheeled vehicles; the <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> cart with fixed seats {{and the second is}} a cart where the driver stands above the axle. The chariots were introduced during the Mitanni era, and none of the pre-Mitanni carriages can be considered chariots, as they are mistakenly described in some sources.|$|E

5|$|The most {{successful}} reagents employed in a stoichiometric fashion are shown below. The <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> bicyclic oxathiane {{that has been}} employed in the synthesis of the β-adrenergic compound dichloroisoproterenol (DCI) but {{is limited by the}} availability of only one enantiomer of the reagent. The synthesis of the axial diastereomer is rationalized via the 1,3-anomeric effect which reduces the nucleophilicity of the equatorial lone pair. The conformation of the ylide is limited by transannular strain and approach of the aldehyde is limited to one face of the ylide by steric interactions with the methyl substituents.|$|E
