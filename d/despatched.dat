5|$|An {{abortive}} {{effort to}} support the French invasion fleet was also made by the Navy of the Batavian Republic, which <b>despatched</b> the small frigates Furie and Waakzaamheid to Ireland with military supplies on 24 October.

50|$|The Semna <b>Despatches</b> {{form one}} of very few records {{that tell us}} about what the forts around the Semna Gorge did, and what life was like in the forts. These <b>Despatches</b> are {{therefore}} very important to us historically, and give us a glimpse into the forts. The <b>Despatches</b> also provide a look at the Egyptians attitudes towards the people of Nubia to the south as they record the interactions between Egyptians and Nubians. These <b>Despatches</b> are now housed in the British Museum.|$|R
5|$|In December 1805, two French squadrons {{departed}} Brest {{under orders}} to disrupt British {{trade in the}} Atlantic Ocean, beginning the Atlantic campaign of 1806. Several British squadrons were <b>despatched</b> in pursuit, including one under Vice-Admiral Sir John Thomas Duckworth originally assigned to blockade Cadiz. On 25 December, Duckworth discovered one of the French squadrons, under Vice-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez, in the mid-Atlantic and gave chase. For {{the next two days}} the squadrons sailed westwards across the Atlantic, until Duckworth abandoned the pursuit, believing that his dispersed squadron was in danger of piecemeal defeat by Willaumez's force. In the aftermath of the pursuit, Willaumez turned towards the South Atlantic while Duckworth, in urgent need of supplies, turned northwest towards the British West Indies. Duckworth was concerned that Willaumez might attempt to pass the Cape of Good Hope and operate in the Indian Ocean, and so <b>despatched</b> one of his ships to augment Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Pellew's small squadron at Madras. This ship was HMS Powerful, a 74-gun ship of the line commanded by Captain Robert Plampin.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the {{conspiracy}} was successfully infiltrated by British intelligence through Irish and Indian channels. The activities of Ghadar on the Pacific coast were noted by W. C.

Justus became the first Bishop of Rochester in 604, and attended a church council in Paris in 614.|$|E

50|$|In August 1914 it was {{reported}} that the <b>despatch</b> riders for the Belgian and Russian armies were equipped exclusively with F.N. motor cycles. However, one month later the Belgian government ordered 50 3 hp Enfield motorcycles for <b>despatch</b> riders. At this time the French Army were still mobilising, but it {{was reported}} they had a squad of Triumphs as well as a variety of French makes. Douglas supplied 100 machines to the Italian Government for <b>despatch</b> purposes in 1916, and by this time the French <b>despatch</b> riders were also using BSAs and Triumphs.|$|R
5|$|After Leonard I. Schiff {{calculated}} that an initiator could theoretically improve {{the efficiency of}} a gun-type fission weapon, Oppenheimer gave approval on 15 March 1945 for initiators {{to be included in}} the Little Boy design. Testing was carried out to ensure that the initiators were rugged enough to handle being transported in an airplane and being accidentally dropped. Eventually, about forty initiators were <b>despatched</b> to Tinian, where four were inserted into the bomb that was used in the bombing of Hiroshima.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} of Quetzaltepeque, Villa Real was still short on food and Mazariegos was ill; he retreated to Copanaguastla against the protests of the town council, which was left to defend the fledgling colony. By now, Nuño de Guzmán was {{governor}} in Mexico, and he <b>despatched</b> Juan Enríquez de Guzmán to Chiapa as end-of-term judge over Mazariegos, and as alcalde mayor (a local colonial governor). He occupied his post for a year, during which time he attempted to reestablish Spanish control over the province, especially the northern and eastern regions, {{but was unable to}} make much headway.|$|E
5|$|As the Russians withdrew, the French {{immediately}} <b>despatched</b> garrisons to the Ionian Islands, rapidly amassing over 7,400 French and Neapolitan {{troops on}} Corfu alone. This effectively turned the Adriatic into a sheltered French sea {{from which they}} could be free to despatch raiders against British convoys, colonies and Royal Navy blockade squadrons, which had controlled the Mediterranean since the Battle of Trafalgar two years earlier. To facilitate this, the French Navy placed significant orders at the Venetian naval yards, intending to build forces in the region with locally produced and crewed vessels.|$|E

5|$|Bligh reached England in April 1790, whereupon the Admiralty <b>despatched</b> HMS Pandora to {{apprehend}} the mutineers.

After turning back toward England, Pandora ran aground on the Great Barrier Reef, {{with the loss of}} 31 crew and 4 prisoners from Bounty. The 10 surviving detainees reached England in June 1792 and were court martialled; 4 were acquitted, 3 were pardoned, and 3 were hanged.|$|E
5|$|For the 357 {{campaign}} season, a {{plan was}} laid down at Constantius' headquarters in Mediolanum (Milan) to trap the Alamanni in eastern Gaul in a pincer movement.

5|$|In {{response}} to notification from Air Traffic Control, three ambulances from Perth were <b>despatched</b> {{in the direction}} of the crash site, known to be somewhere between Chidlow and York. The crash site was several miles from the road so the ambulance crews travelled eastwards all the way to York without sighting a fire. The crews were eventually guided back along the main road and then along a dirt road that enabled them to drive to within three or four miles of the crash site. The crews then took their first-aid boxes and set out on foot.|$|E
