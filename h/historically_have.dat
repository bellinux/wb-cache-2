5|$|Bolton's main rivals <b>historically</b> <b>have</b> {{been with}} near {{neighbours}} Bury, though this has lessened since the Second World War {{as the two}} clubs have rarely {{been in the same}} league. The club also has a rivalry with Blackburn Rovers, as the two sides are separated by just fifteen miles and are both founder members of the Football League. More recently, Bolton have developed an enmity with Wigan Athletic, whose fans generally regard Bolton as their main rivals. Bolton fans maintain a mutual dislike with the fans of Tranmere Rovers, Burnley, and Wolverhampton Wanderers.|$|E
5|$|Constructing {{composite}} bows requires {{much more}} time and {{a greater variety of}} materials than self bows, and the animal glue used can lose strength in humid conditions; the 6th-century Byzantine military manual, the Strategikon, advised the cavalry of the Byzantine army, many of whom were armed with composite bows, to keep their bows in leather cases to keep them dry. Karpowicz suggests that crafting a composite bow may take a week's work, excluding drying time (months) and gathering materials, while a self bow can be made in a day and dried in a week. Peoples living in humid or rainy regions <b>historically</b> <b>have</b> favoured self-bows, while those living in dry or arid regions have favoured composite bows.|$|E
5|$|The Georgetown University men's {{basketball}} team {{is perhaps the}} most well-known Hoya program. Georgetown's first intercollegiate men's {{basketball team}} was formed in 1907. Former Georgetown great Patrick Ewing is the head coach. The Hoyas <b>historically</b> <b>have</b> been well regarded not only for their team success, but also for their ability to generate players that after graduation succeed both on the court, such as Patrick Ewing, and off, such as Paul Tagliabue and Henry Hyde. The team has reached the NCAA Tournament Final Four five times including the 1984 national championship, and has won the Big East Tournament seven times, and has also won or shared the Big East regular season title seven times.|$|E

5|$|The Progress Party has {{historically}} sometimes been portrayed externally as a populist or right-wing populist party (or other similar terms), both by opposing politicians, {{as well as}} some scholars. Depending on definitions of populism, other scholars have however found that populism is at best a minor element of the party, or that its policies <b>historically</b> <b>have</b> been more consistent than for instance those of the Labour Party, which has moved more towards the Progress Party and neoliberalism since the 1980s. Political scientist Anders Todal Jensen has argued that the Progress Party is the only populist party in Norway, with all the other parties in contrast having strong elitist foundations. He has suggested that populism could actually be a sign of health as the structures of the traditional parties make them poorly able to “listen to the people” in the same manner that the Progress Party may.|$|E
5|$|Many European {{countries}} have professional leagues as well, the most successful, {{other than the}} Dutch league, being the Italian league founded in 1948. Compared to those in Asia and Latin America, the various European leagues and the one in Australia <b>historically</b> <b>have</b> had no more than niche appeal. In 2004, Australia won a surprise silver medal at the Olympic Games. The Israel Baseball League, launched in 2007, folded after one season. The Confédération Européene de Baseball (European Baseball Confederation), founded in 1953, organizes a number of competitions between clubs from different countries, as well as national squads. Other competitions between national teams, such as the Baseball World Cup and the Olympic baseball tournament, were administered by the International Baseball Federation (IBAF) from its formation in 1938 until its 2013 merger with the International Softball Federation to create the current joint governing body for both sports, the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC). By 2009, the IBAF had 117 member countries. Women's baseball is played on an organized amateur basis {{in many of the}} countries where it is a leading men's sport. Since 2004, the IBAF and now WBSC have sanctioned the Women's Baseball World Cup, featuring national teams.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh Springer Spaniel is a {{breed of}} dog {{and a member}} of the spaniel family. Thought to be {{comparable}} to the old Land Spaniel, they are similar to the English Springer Spaniel and <b>historically</b> <b>have</b> been referred to as both the Welsh Spaniel and the Welsh Cocker Spaniel. They were relatively unknown until a succession of victories in dog trials by the breed increased its popularity. Following recognition by The Kennel Club in 1902, the breed gained the modern name of Welsh Springer Spaniel. The breed's coat only comes in a single colour combination of white with red markings, usually in a piebald pattern. Loyal and affectionate, they can become very attached to family members and are wary of strangers. Health conditions are limited to those common among many breeds of dog, although they are affected more than average by hip dysplasia and some eye conditions. They are a working dog, bred for hunting, and while not as rare as some varieties of spaniel, they are rarer than the more widely known English Springer Spaniel with which they are sometimes confused.|$|E
