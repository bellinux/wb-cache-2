5|$|Subcutaneous {{emphysema}} of {{the chest}} wall is commonly among the first signs to appear that barotrauma, damage caused by excessive pressure, has occurred, and it <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> the lung was subjected to significant barotrauma. Thus the phenomenon may occur in diving injuries.|$|E
25|$|Only {{reaction}} product A results from antiperiplanar elimination. The presence of product B <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> an E1 mechanism is occurring.|$|E
25|$|In a {{description}} by Craesbeeck in 1726, he substantiated that {{the walls were}} {{in a state of}} ruin. But, in the 1758 Memórias Paroquiais there <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> the old castle was only survived by the tower keep.|$|E
5000|$|Bioactive {{compounds}} induce phenotypic {{changes in}} target cells, {{changes that are}} observable by microscopy, and which can give insight into the mechanism of action of the compound. [...] With antibacterial agents, for example, the conversion of target cells to spheroplasts can <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> peptidoglycan synthesis <b>is</b> being targeted, and filamentation of target cells can <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> FtsZ or DNA is being targeted. [...] In the case of anticancer agents, bleb formation can <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> the compound <b>is</b> disrupting the plasma membrane. [...] A current limitation {{of this approach is}} the time required to manually generate and interpret data, but advances in automated microscopy and image analysis software may help resolve this.|$|R
5000|$|Bills for {{services}} like gas, water, electricity not arriving in time. This can <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> your mail <b>was</b> stolen or redirected ...|$|R

25|$|Poorly {{tempered}} chocolate {{may have}} whitish {{spots on the}} dark chocolate part, called chocolate bloom; it <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> sugar and/or fat has separated due to poor storage. It is not toxic and can be safely consumed.|$|E
25|$|Compared {{with last}} year, the {{percentage}} of schools that earned below 60 declined by nearly 1 percent per Secretary of Education Carolyn Dumaresq. She reported that this <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> student achievement is improving as school resources are being used better.|$|E
25|$|Outside of cricket, there <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> Ward played {{football}} for Waterside, {{who won the}} 1940 Chatham Cup, with Ward scoring a goal in the final against Mosgiel as Waterside ran out 6-2 winners. This was the team's third straight title.|$|E
25|$|Because of its sturdy {{structure}} and protected location, fractures of the scapula are uncommon. When they do occur, they <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> severe chest trauma has occurred.|$|R
3000|$|... respectively. The {{distribution}} of D is skewed {{to the left}} with a negative value while that of others is skewed to the right with positive values. The values of the skewness, together with the statistical trends shown in Figs.  2 and 3, <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> the data <b>is</b> not symmetrical. The negative kurtosis of all the predictor and target variables shows that the {{distribution of}} the data is flat rather than being peaked or Gaussian. All these <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> the data <b>is</b> typical of real-life experimental data and not simulated.|$|R
50|$|Like other cirrus clouds, cirrus {{fibratus}} {{occur at}} high altitudes. They can indicate an approaching warm front; however, {{they can also}} <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> fair weather will follow.|$|R
25|$|Electricity {{prices vary}} {{considerably}} from one distribution company to another. Small (high cost) consumers have high prices and larger (lower cost) consumers have lower prices. This <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> tariffs in El Salvador reflect costs {{better than those}} in other countries.|$|E
25|$|The {{rejection}} of the reference topology <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> the evolutionary history for that gene family is inconsistent with the reference tree. When these inconsistencies cannot be explained using {{a small number of}} non-horizontal events, such as gene loss and duplication, an HGT event is inferred.|$|E
25|$|In Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, {{while no}} {{mutations}} could be demonstrated, there <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> thiamine deficiency leads to Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome only in those whose transketolase has a reduced affinity for thiamine. In this way, {{the activity of}} transketolase is greatly hindered, and, as a consequence, the entire pentose phosphate pathway is inhibited.|$|E
50|$|Additional, non-memory {{chips on}} the module may <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> {{designed}} for high capacity memory systems for servers, {{and that the}} module may be incompatible with mass-market systems.|$|R
50|$|The work of Peeter Symons is {{virtually}} unknown. An inventory of 1644 mentions {{a painting of}} a fish by Symons, which could <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> the artist painted still lifes.|$|R
50|$|If there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{significant}} (greater than 10%) {{difference between}} cylinders, <b>that</b> may <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> valves or cylinder head gaskets are leaking, piston rings are worn, {{or that the}} block is cracked.|$|R
25|$|The slumped {{concrete}} takes various {{shapes and}} according to the profile of slumped concrete, the slump is termed as true slump, shear slump or collapse slump. If a shear or collapse slump is achieved, a fresh sample should be taken and the test repeated. A collapse slump <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> the mix is too wet.|$|E
25|$|The {{line end}} {{clearance}} distance of 28 nm essentially forces pitches {{to be at}} least 56 nm for EUV single exposure bi-directional patterning. 7nm node minimum metal pitch is already at 40 nm or below, while gate pitch can also be below 56 nm, so this <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> multiple patterning would be needed even for EUV at 7nm.|$|E
25|$|Between the {{solstice}} {{observation of}} Meton and his own, there were 297 years spanning 108,478 days. D. Rawlins {{noted that this}} implies a tropical year of 365.24579... days = 365days;14,44,51 (sexagesimal; = 365days + 14/60 + 44/602 + 51/603) and that this exact year length has been found {{on one of the}} few Babylonian clay tablets which explicitly specifies the System B month. This <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> Hipparchus's work was known to Chaldeans.|$|E
5000|$|Particularly, {{the mission}} will characterise spatial, {{temporal}} variation, and localisation of sources {{for a broad}} list of atmospheric trace gases. If methane (...) {{is found in the}} presence of propane (...) or ethane (...) , <b>that</b> will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> strong <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> biological processes are involved. However, if methane is found in the presence of gases such as sulfur dioxide (...) , <b>that</b> would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> the methane <b>is</b> <b>a</b> byproduct of geological processes.|$|R
2500|$|Boric acid is {{injected}} into reactor number 2 after {{the discovery of}} xenon in its containment vessel. [...] The presence of xenon may <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> self-sustained fission reaction has been occurring.|$|R
5000|$|While art restorers legitimately use new {{stretcher}} bars {{when the}} old bars have worn, new stretcher bars on old canvases might <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> forger <b>is</b> attempting to alter the painting’s identity.|$|R
25|$|When {{potato tubers}} {{are exposed to}} light, they turn green and {{increase}} glycoalkaloid production. This is a natural defense to help prevent the uncovered tuber from being eaten. The green colour is from chlorophyll, and is itself harmless. However, it <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> increased level of solanine and chaconine may be present. In potato tubers, 30–80% of the solanine develops in {{and close to the}} skin, and some potato varieties have high levels of solanine.|$|E
25|$|Conditions {{that call}} for colonoscopies include {{gastrointestinal}} hemorrhage, unexplained changes in bowel habit and suspicion of malignancy. Colonoscopies are often used to diagnose colon cancer, but are also frequently used to diagnose inflammatory bowel disease. In older patients (sometimes even younger ones) an unexplained drop in hematocrit (one sign of anemia) <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> calls for a colonoscopy, usually along with an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), even if no obvious blood has {{been seen in the}} stool (feces).|$|E
25|$|Typical {{particles}} {{produced in}} such collisions are neutrons and charged mesons such as {{positive or negative}} pions and kaons. Some of these subsequently decay into muons, which are able to reach {{the surface of the}} Earth, and even penetrate for some distance into shallow mines. The muons can be easily detected by many types of particle detectors, such as cloud chambers, bubble chambers or scintillation detectors. The observation of a secondary shower of particles in multiple detectors at the same time <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> all of the particles came from that event.|$|E
50|$|Reflections cause {{standing}} waves {{to be set}} up on the line. Conversely, {{standing waves}} <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> reflections <b>are</b> present. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> relationship between the measures of reflection coefficient and standing wave ratio.|$|R
5000|$|Similarly, {{reference}} in section 29(1) to the Investigating Director's entering premises [...] "without prior notice" [...] <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> the legislature had intended the default {{position to be}} one where no notice was required.|$|R
5000|$|According to Israeli {{journalist}} Shmuel Rosner, Gilon's {{return to}} the U.S. in late 2005 <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> [...] "no serious allegations concerning Israel's involvement in the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) affair still exist." ...|$|R
25|$|Pahawh {{is written}} left to right. Each {{syllable}} is written with two letters, an onset (la, an initial consonant or consonant cluster) and a rime (yu, a vowel, diphthong, or vowel plus final consonant). However, {{the order of}} these elements is rime-initial, the opposite of their spoken order. (That is, each syllable {{would seem to be}} written right to left, if it were transcribed literally into the Roman alphabet.) This <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> Shong conceived of the rimes as primary; Pahawh Hmong might therefore {{be thought of as a}} vowel-centered abugida. Tones and many onsets are distinguished by diacritics.|$|E
25|$|Finally, the Unicode {{encoding}} of Arabic is in logical order, that is, {{the characters}} are entered, and stored in computer memory, in the order that they are written and pronounced without worrying about {{the direction in which}} they will be displayed on paper or on the screen. Again, it is left to the rendering engine to present the characters in the correct direction, using Unicode's bi-directional text features. In this regard, if the Arabic words on this page are written left to right, it <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> the Unicode rendering engine used to display them is out of date.|$|E
25|$|The {{respiratory}} tube {{is also known}} in LACM 128319, preserved as cartilaginous tracheal rings. Only the posterior-most end of the tracheal tube – {{at the end of}} the neck near the pectoral girdle – is known. The section where the two bronchi split was also preserved in the specimen, but was destroyed during excavation. This <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> Platecarpus and other mosasaurs had two functional lungs. Snakes, which are closely related to mosasaurs, have only one functional lung with the second often being vestigial or absent. Unlike terrestrial lizards, however, the bronchi separate in front of the area of the forelimbs rather than at the level of the limbs.|$|E
5000|$|Despite the {{explicit}} common referrals to [...] "subjective" [...] {{reason in the}} book, his frequent connecting of it with relativism could <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> by [...] "subjective reason" [...] Horkheimer also means [...] "relativist reason".|$|R
500|$|Reflections cause {{standing}} waves {{to be set}} up on the line. [...] Conversely, {{standing waves}} <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> reflections <b>are</b> present. [...] There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> relationship between the measures of reflection coefficient and standing wave ratio.|$|R
50|$|During {{his earlier}} years, Eucratides II may have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> co-regent of his father: on his later coins he adds the title Soter (Saviour), which could <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> <b>that</b> he now ruled {{in his own}} right.|$|R
