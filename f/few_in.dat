5|$|It {{has been}} said that Jehovah's Witnesses do not entirely oppose the idea of {{national}} service, but rather the notion of armed military service. Thio Li-ann has commented that it may be administratively possible to devise a non-military national service for Jehovah's Witnesses, who are very <b>few</b> <b>in</b> number.|$|E

5|$|The dispute {{lasted until}} 1753 and {{involved}} many of London's periodicals. It eventually resulted in countless essays, poems, {{and even a}} series of mock epic poems starting with Smart's The Hilliad. Although it is unknown what actually started the dispute, it resulted in a divide of authors who either supported Fielding or supported Hill, and <b>few</b> <b>in</b> between.|$|E

5|$|At {{the head}} of the {{principal}} staircase an Anteroom divides the former Great Chamber from what would have been the main bedroom. During the 19th century, this room was furnished as an armoury. The adjoining bedroom, the Garden Chamber, was used as a bedroom by Lord Curzon during the early 20th century, and as such was equipped with a plumbed bath hidden in a wardrobe, one of the <b>few</b> <b>in</b> the house.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies {{have the}} typical four-stage insect life cycle. Winged adults lay eggs {{on the food}} plant on which their larvae, known as {{caterpillars}}, will feed. The caterpillars grow, sometimes very rapidly, and when fully developed, pupate in a chrysalis. When metamorphosis is complete, the pupal skin splits, the adult insect climbs out, and after its wings have expanded and dried, it flies off. Some butterflies, especially in the tropics, have several generations in a year, while others have a single generation, and a <b>few</b> <b>in</b> cold locations may take several years to pass through their whole life cycle.|$|E
5|$|Cookbooks, or more specifically, recipe collections, {{compiled}} in the Middle Ages {{are among}} the most important historical sources for medieval cuisine. The first cookbooks began to appear {{towards the end of the}} 13th century. The Liber de coquina, perhaps originating near Naples, and the Tractatus de modo preparandi have found a modern editor in Marianne Mulon, and a cookbook from Assisi found at Châlons-sur-Marne has been edited by Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat. Though it is assumed that they describe real dishes, food scholars do not believe they were used as cookbooks might be today, as a step-by-step guide through the cooking procedure that could be kept at hand while preparing a dish. <b>Few</b> <b>in</b> a kitchen, at those times, would have been able to read, and working texts have a low survival rate.|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} the abilities of Dynamic Indicator of Basic Early Literacy Skills Oral Reading Fluency (DORF) and the Developmental Reading Assessment (DRA) {{to be used as}} screening measures for predicting performance on the yearly state reading assessment in New York. Data from 194 students’ performance on DORF, DRA, and the English Language Arts (ELA) assessment were examined from an existing data base. Participants’ scores on the DORF and the DRA in third grade were compared to their performance on the fourth grade ELA. Screening cut scores were developed for each benchmarking period to assist in identifying students who need additional reading support and intervention. Patterns of correlations between the screening measures and the ELA were examined. Risk indicators were determined by examining receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and by creating screening outcome matrices. Results support DORF risk indicators 70 words read correct (WRC) or <b>fewer</b> <b>in</b> the fall, 80 WRC or <b>fewer</b> <b>in</b> the winter, and 100 WRC or <b>fewer</b> <b>in</b> the spring and DRA risk indicators of 14 or <b>fewer</b> <b>in</b> the fall and 16 or <b>fewer</b> <b>in</b> the spring. Results further support the use of the DORF and DRA as screening measures for identifying students at risk for low reading skills and failing state assessments...|$|R

5|$|For the Canadian contingent, Laurence and Mackenzie set out {{to recruit}} some top nuclear physicists, of whom there were <b>few</b> <b>in</b> Canada. The first was George Volkoff at the University of British Columbia, {{who had worked with}} Robert Oppenheimer on the physics of neutron stars. They also tried to recruit Harry Thode from McMaster University, but found that Harold Urey from the Manhattan Project's SAM Laboratories was also {{interested}} in Thode's expertise in testing heavy water with mass spectrography, and had made a more attractive offer. A compromise was reached whereby Thode did work for the Montreal Laboratory, but remained at McMaster University. Promising young Canadian scientists were also recruited, including J. Carson Mark, Phil Wallace and Leo Yaffe.|$|E
5|$|Groundwater {{levels have}} been dropping, to varying degrees, {{in many areas}} of the city, due in part to an {{increase}} in the amount of rainwater discharged directly into sewers rather than absorbed by the ground. A city agency, the Boston Groundwater Trust, coordinates monitoring of groundwater levels throughout the city via a network of public and private monitoring wells. However, Boston's drinking water supply, from the Quabbin and Wachusett Reservoirs to the west, is one of the very <b>few</b> <b>in</b> the country so pure as to satisfy federal water quality standards without filtration.|$|E
5|$|He {{finds the}} mixture of bird species {{intermediate}} between those of Java and Australia, with 36 species actually Javan, and 11 closely related; while there are only 13 actually Australian, with 35 closely related. Wallace interprets this to mean that {{a small number of}} birds from Australia, and a larger number from Java, colonised Timor and then evolved into new species endemic to the island. The land mammals were very <b>few</b> <b>in</b> number: the six species were endemic or related to those of Java or the Moluccas, with none from Australia, so he doubts there was ever a land bridge to that continent.|$|E

5|$|In late 546, when John Troglita reached Carthage, the {{situation}} was dire: the imperial troops, under Marcentius the dux of Byzacena and Gregory the Armenian in Carthage, were <b>few</b> <b>in</b> number and demoralized. They held out in the coastal cities, blockaded by the Moors of Byzacena under their chieftain Antalas, while the Leuathae and Austurae tribes from Tripolitania were raiding Byzacena with impunity. Diplomatic efforts, however, secured the allegiance of the Moorish leaders Cutzinas and Ifisdaias, who joined the imperial army with several thousands of their men. In addition, the tribesmen of the Aurès Mountains under Iaudas withdrew to Numidia on learning of Troglita's arrival and pursued a course of armed neutrality.|$|E

5|$|Metagenomics allows {{researchers}} {{to access the}} functional and metabolic diversity of microbial communities, but it cannot show which of these processes are active. The extraction and analysis of metagenomic mRNA (the metatranscriptome) provides information on the regulation and expression profiles of complex communities. Because of the technical difficulties (the short half-life of mRNA, for example) {{in the collection of}} environmental RNA there have been relatively <b>few</b> <b>in</b> situ metatranscriptomic studies of microbial communities to date. While originally limited to microarray technology, metatranscriptomcs studies have made use of transcriptomics technologies to measure whole-genome expression and quantification of a microbial community, first employed in analysis of ammonia oxidation in soils.|$|E

Firmly religious, he can be timid and something of a pushover. He is a Republican and a devout Evangelical Christian who strictly follows the Bible literally and is easily shocked when challenged on any point of dogma.

5|$|On 1 January 1942, MacArthur {{accepted}} $500,000 from President Quezon of the Philippines as {{payment for}} his pre-war service. MacArthur's staff members also received payments: $75,000 for Sutherland, $45,000 for Richard Marshall, and $20,000 for Huff. Eisenhower—after being appointed Supreme Commander Allied Expeditionary Force (AEF)—was also offered money by Quezon, but declined. These payments were {{known only to}} a <b>few</b> <b>in</b> Manila and Washington, including President Roosevelt and Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, until they were made public by historian Carol Petillo in 1979. While the payments had been fully legal, the revelation tarnished MacArthur's reputation.|$|E
