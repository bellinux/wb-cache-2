5|$|The {{only time}} in the year when {{separate}} food is cooked for the goddess is when she is offered non-vegetarian offerings. During Durga Puja, Vimala is offered non-vegetarian food and animal sacrifice, traditionally offered to the Hindu Mother Goddess. The goddess is considered to assume a destructive form during the festival and the meat is considered necessary to placate her. In strict secrecy during the pre-dawn hours, animal sacrifice of a <b>he-goat</b> is offered in the temple, while fish from the sacred Markanda temple tank are cooked and offered to Vimala, as per Tantric rituals. The rituals have to be completed before {{the doors of the}} main sanctum of the vegetarian Jagannath are opened at dawn and the first morning aarti is offered to the god. Vaishnava devotees of Jagannath are debarred from the temple. Only a few who witness the ceremony are given the Bimala parusa (Vimala's cuisine) as prasad. The animal sacrifice and the non-vegetarian offerings to Vimala produced protests.|$|E
25|$|Animals {{that are}} special in divination and {{sacrifice}} include a white <b>he-goat,</b> a white ram, a tortoise and male wall gecko. These animals are prized for their rarity, price {{and therefore the}} journey taken to obtain. Chameleons and rats are used for more stronger medicines and deadly poisons, and antidotes can include lambs, small chickens, eggs, and oils. Nzu is used in rites from birth to death and is used to mark sacred buildings and spaces. Agwu Nsi is the Igbo patron deity of health and divination and is related to insanity, confusion, and unusual human behaviour which is linked to possession of Agwu by the diviner. Agwu can be manifested by other alusi so {{that there could be}} images of a divination Ikenga or Ikenga Agwu for instance.|$|E

500|$|Witches' Sabbath or The Great <b>He-Goat</b> (...) are names {{given to}} an oil mural by the Spanish artist Francisco Goya, {{completed}} sometime between 1821 and 1823. It explores themes of violence, intimidation, aging and death. Satan hulks, {{in the form}} of a goat, in moonlit silhouette over a coven of ugly and terrified witches. A withdrawn young girl in black sits to the far right, apart and withdrawn from the other women; perhaps in defiance. Goya was then around 75 years old, living alone and suffering from acute mental and physical distress.|$|E
500|$|Goya did not title {{any of the}} {{fourteen}} Black Paintings; their modern names came about after his death.

The works today are known by a variety of titles, most of which date to around the 1860s: his children were largely responsible for the names, with close friend [...] contributing the rest. The title El Gran Cabron (The Great <b>He-Goat)</b> was given by painter Antonio Brugada (1804–63). The Basque term for a Witches' Sabbath, akelarre, {{is the source of the}} Spanish title Aquelarre and a derivation of akerra, the Basque word for a male goat, which may have been combined with the word larre ("field") to arrive at akelarre.|$|E

Like all types of sacrifices offered on the altar, the flour had to be unscented and the animal had to be completely unblemished. This offered sacrifice accompanied the important required core means of atonement for the committing of an unintentional transgression of a prohibition, that either has brought guilt upon the 'community of Israel' or the individual. This offering is brought during or after atonement for those transgressions that had been committed inadvertently, or in ignorance: intentional transgressions could only be absolved by other forms of atonement, or in severe cases kareth. It was distinct from the biblical guilt offering.|$|R
