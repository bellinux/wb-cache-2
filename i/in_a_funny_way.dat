This wasn’t a parody, it was “Good God, how can I find {{a different sort of}} gunslinger?” Right away, I thought of a woman gunslinger, and the idea for the script came to me all of a sudden. It was the sheriff’s wife. He’s killed and she takes over for her husband. It was logical when it wasn’t, but that was enough for a six-or seven-day western.|$|E
500|$|Both of Benn's grandfathers were Liberal Party MPs; his {{paternal}} {{grandfather was}} John Benn, a successful politician, MP for Tower Hamlets and later Devonport, who was created a baronet in 1914 (and who founded a publishing company, Benn Brothers), and his maternal grandfather was Daniel Holmes, MP for Glasgow Govan. Benn's contact with leading politicians of the day, {{dates back to}} his earliest years. He met Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald when he was five years old, whom he described as: [...] "A kindly old gentleman [...] leaned over me and offered me a chocolate biscuit. I've looked at Labour leaders <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>funny</b> <b>way</b> ever since." [...] Benn also met former Liberal Prime Minister David Lloyd George when he was twelve, and later recalled that, while still a boy, he once shook hands with Mahatma Gandhi; in 1931, while his father was Secretary of State for India.|$|E

So I went back and listened to all the music that made me {{want to be in a}} band, right from the Buzzcocks, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Echo & The Bunnymen, all that stuff. And what was interesting is, that was what a lot of people in bands now are listening to anyway. So <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>funny</b> <b>way,</b> it made us completely contemporary." ...|$|E

In February 2007, a second project started: OnNieuws (UnNews), a news paper full of nonsense.

60|$|I {{met her at}} Cromer, {{where she}} was one {{of a small group of}} five visitors; three ladies, one old, the others middle-aged, and a middle- aged gentleman.

60|$|The sudden flight almost {{caused a}} panic and an awful breach of {{hospitality}} {{among the few}} who were quietly watching things. To cover an irrepressible chuckle I slipped away after K'dunk, who scrambled clear to the pie-plant patch before he stopped hopping. As I went I heard the gentle Mrs. James, soul of goodness and hospitality, coughing violently into her handkerchief, as if a rude draught had struck her sensitive throat; but it sounded to me more like a squirrel that I once heard snickering inside of a hollow pumpkin. However, the tenor sang on, and all was well. K'dunk meanwhile was engaged in the better task of ridding the garden of noxious bugs, sitting up at times, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>funny</b> <b>way</b> he had, and scratching the place where his ear should be.|$|E
6000|$|He was a {{wonderful}} man, this Cap'n Bill. Not so very old, although his hair was grizzled--what there was of it. Most of his head was bald as an egg and as shiny as oilcloth, and this made his big ears stick out <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>funny</b> <b>way.</b> His eyes had a gentle look and were pale blue in color, and his round face was rugged and bronzed. Cap'n Bill's left leg was missing, from the knee down, {{and that was why}} the sailor no longer sailed the seas. The wooden leg he wore was good enough to stump around with on land, or even to take Trot out for a row or a sail on the ocean, {{but when it came to}} [...] "runnin' up aloft" [...] or performing active duties on shipboard, the old sailor was not equal to the task. The loss of his leg had ruined his career and the old sailor found comfort in devoting himself to the education and companionship of the little girl.|$|E
6000|$|Nelly ran to {{get both}} her chests, and, sitting {{down beside the}} bird, tried to feed it. To her joy it ate crumb after crumb, {{as if it were}} half starved, and soon fluttered nearer a confiding fearlessness that made her very proud. Soon baby Robin seemed quite comfortable, his eye brightened, he [...] "queeked" [...] no more, and but for the {{drooping}} wing would have been himself again. With one of her bandages Nelly bound both wings closely to his sides for fear he should hurt himself by trying to fly; and though he seemed amazed at her proceedings, he behaved very well, only staring at her, and ruffling up his few feathers <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>funny</b> <b>way</b> that made her laugh. Then she had to discover some way of accommodating her two larger patients so that neither should hurt nor alarm the other. A bright thought came to her after much pondering. Carefully lifting the handkerchief, she pinned the two ends to the roof of the cart, and there swung little Forked-tongue, while Rob lay easily below.|$|E
