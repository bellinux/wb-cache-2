500|$|Roosevelt {{also had}} a close {{relationship}} with Associated Press (AP) reporter Lorena Hickok, who covered her during the last months of the presidential campaign and [...] "fell madly in love with her". During this period, Roosevelt wrote daily 10- to 15-page letters to [...] "Hick", who was planning to write a biography of the First Lady. The letters included such endearments as, [...] "I want to put my arms around you & kiss you at the corner of your mouth," [...] and, [...] "I can't kiss you, so I <b>kiss</b> <b>your</b> 'picture' good night and good morning!" [...] At Franklin's 1933 inauguration, Eleanor wore a sapphire ring Hickok had given her. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover despised Roosevelt's liberalism, her stance regarding civil rights, and her and her husband FDR's criticisms of Hoover's surveillance tactics, and so Hoover maintained a large file on Roosevelt, which the filmmakers of the biopic J. Edgar (2011) indicate included compromising evidence of this relationship, which Hoover intended to blackmail Roosevelt with. Compromised as a reporter, Hickok soon resigned her position with the AP to be closer to Eleanor, who secured her a job as an investigator for a New Deal program.|$|E

500|$|The Jazz Singer had its European sound premiere at the Piccadilly Theatre in London on September 27, 1928. According to film {{historian}} Rachael Low, [...] "Many in {{the industry}} realized at once that a change to sound production was inevitable." [...] On January 16, 1929, the first European feature film with a synchronized vocal performance and recorded score premiered: the German production Ich küsse Ihre Hand, Madame (I <b>Kiss</b> <b>Your</b> Hand, Madame). Dialogueless, it contains only a few songs performed by Richard Tauber. The movie was made with the sound-on-film system controlled by the German-Dutch firm Tobis, corporate heirs to the Tri-Ergon concern. With an eye toward commanding the emerging European market for sound film, Tobis entered into a compact with its chief competitor, Klangfilm, a joint subsidiary of Germany's two leading electrical manufacturers. Early in 1929, Tobis and Klangfilm began comarketing their recording and playback technologies. As ERPI began to wire theaters around Europe, Tobis-Klangfilm claimed that the Western Electric system infringed on the Tri-Ergon patents, stalling the introduction of American technology in many places. Just as RCA had entered the movie business to maximize its recording system's value, Tobis also established its own production operations.|$|E

2500|$|The film's {{underscore}} {{was composed}} by Victor Young.

2500|$|Spector {{commissioned}} Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil {{to write}} a song for the group, bringing them over from New York to Los Angeles {{to stay at the}} Chateau Marmont Hotel so they could write the song. Taking a cue from [...] "Baby I Need Your Loving" [...] by The Four Tops that was then rising in the charts, Mann and Weil decided {{to write a}} ballad. Mann wrote the melody first, and came up with the opening line [...] "You never close your eyes anymore when I <b>kiss</b> <b>your</b> lips", influenced by a line from the song [...] "I Love How You Love Me" [...] that was co-written by Mann - [...] "I love how your eyes close whenever you kiss me". Mann and Weil wrote the first two verses quickly, including the chorus line [...] "you've lost that lovin' feelin'", and Spector added [...] "gone, gone, gone, whoa, whoa, whoa" [...] {{to the end of the}} chorus, which Weil disliked. [...] The line [...] "you've lost that lovin' feelin'" [...] was originally only intended to be a dummy line that would be replaced later, but Spector liked it and decided to keep it. The form of the song is of verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus or ABABCB form. [...] Mann and Weil had problems writing the bridge and the ending, and asked Spector for help. Spector experimented on the piano with a [...] "Hang On Sloopy" [...] riff that they would then use to build on for the bridge.|$|E
