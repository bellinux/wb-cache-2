40|$|Research {{has shown}} that group support systems can improve the {{classroom}} experience. However, some teachers are reluctant to adopt the technology due to student flaming. We define flaming as the launching of vitriolic personal attacks, often anonymously and often {{with the use of}} profane or obscene language. This paper posits a theoretical causal model <b>for</b> <b>flaming</b> based on deindividuation and extended cognitive learning theory. It then presents a longitudinal experiment, the results of which support our model of flaming. The paper describes three cases from the field where student flaming occurred in new electronic classroom installations, and discusses five successful strategies from these cases <b>for</b> eliminating <b>flaming</b> without losing the benefits of student anonymity. The paper concludes with implications for researchers and practitioners on how to limit flaming in the electronic classroom...|$|R

60|$|If {{you look}} for extravagance of colour, <b>for</b> <b>flaming</b> shop fronts and glaring lanterns, you shall find {{none of these things}} in the narrow stone-paved streets of Nagasaki. But if you desire details of house construction, glimpses of perfect cleanliness, rare taste, and perfect {{subordination}} of the thing made {{to the needs of the}} maker, you shall find all you seek and more. All the roofs are dull lead colour, being shingled or tiled, and all the house fronts are of the colour of the wood as God made it. There is neither smoke nor haze, and in the clear light of a clouded sky I could see down the narrowest alleyway as into the interior of a cabinet.|$|R

40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines has {{constructed}} a smoke chamber and developed sensitivity tests for smoke detectors. Response of ionization- and optical-type commercially available smoke detectors have been investigated. Six smoke detectors were measured {{with respect to}} visually obscuring smoke characterized by a corresponding optical density <b>for</b> smoldering and <b>flaming</b> coal combustion in the smoke chamber. It was determined that for one type of ionization smoke detector the alarm time was nearly equivalent to that of an odor monitor's alarm for smoldering coal combustion experiments and earlier <b>for</b> <b>flaming</b> coal combustion experiments. The experiments showed that an average CO concentration of 5 ppm corresponded to an optical density of 0. 022 m for smoldering and flaming- 1 coal combustion. Two of the commercially available ionization-type smoke detectors were more responsive to flaming than smoldering coal combustion at an optical density of 0. 022 m, whereas the optical smoke detectors- 1 showed the opposite trend. The responsive characteristics of the detectors evaluated with respect to known smoke conditions in the smoke chamber shows their potential for use as mine fire sensors or part of a mine atmospheric monitoring system to improve mine safety...|$|R
40|$|Approximation methods {{exist to}} provide {{estimates}} of smoke detector response based on optical density, temperature rise, and gas velocity thresholds. The {{objective of this}} study was to assess the uncertainty associated with these estimation methods. Experimental data was used to evaluate recommended alarm thresholds and to quantify the associated error. With few exceptions, less than 50 percent of the predicted alarm times occurred within ± 60 seconds of the experimental alarms. At best, errors of 20 to 60 percent (in under-prediction) occurred for smoldering fires using an optical density threshold. <b>For</b> <b>flaming</b> fires, errors in predicted alarm times on the order of 100 to 1000 percent in over-prediction of the experimental alarms were common. Overall, none of the approximation methods distinguished themselves as vastly superior. Great care must be exercised when applying these approximation methods to ensure that the uncertainty in the predicted alarm times is appropriately considered...|$|R
40|$|The {{concentrations}} and {{proportions of}} 15 alkenes, 5 alkadienes and 14 other gaseous combustion-formed hydrocarbons were determined near to a controlled field burning of last year´s grass. Small-scale model burning of grasses and of barley straw indicated similar hydrocarbon proportions {{for all these}} biomass fuels. Samples were taken on triple-layer adsorbent cartridges and were analyzed, after thermal desorption, by gas chromatography on an aluminium oxide column. The observed proportions of ethene (20 - 50 %) and ethyne (5 - 20 %) increased <b>for</b> <b>flaming</b> fire and decreased for smouldering. Approximate proportions of prominent genotoxic hydrocarbons other than ethene were 10 % benzene, 10 % propene, and 3 % 1, 3 -butadiene. Among the photochemically reactive C 4 -C 8 alkenes, the unbranched 1 -alkenes were the most prominent isomers. It is concluded that grass burning implies hazards with respect to human exposure {{as well as to}} photooxidant formation...|$|R

25|$|Thomas Nevins, Chief Engineer of the Brooklyn Fire Department, {{arrived at}} the theatre around 11:26pm; he decided {{immediately}} that the building was lost and his job was one of confinement. Dieter Hotel, {{on the corner of}} Washington and Johnson streets, was lower than the theatre, its broad flat roof was an inviting target <b>for</b> <b>flaming</b> debris. The First Police Precinct station house, south of the theatre, was an old brick building with dry wooden support beams. Ramshackle wooden frame buildings stretched down the block on Flood's Alley opposite the burning theatre. At that point, the prevailing wind was from the west, carrying smoke and cinders east, dropping firebrands onto these old structures. The Post Office, south of the police station house, was filled with paper mail. Nevins had called {{in the second and third}} alarms while on the way to the fire; when the additional equipment arrived, he deployed the engines around the block to keep adjoining buildings free of sparks and burning debris.|$|R
