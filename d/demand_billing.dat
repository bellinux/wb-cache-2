5000|$|The paper bills {{issued by}} the colonies were known as [...] "bills of credit." [...] Bills of credit were usually fiat money: {{they could not be}} {{exchanged}} for a fixed amount of gold or silver coins upon <b>demand.</b> <b>Bills</b> of credit were usually issued by colonial governments to pay debts. The governments would then retire the currency by accepting the bills for payment of taxes. When colonial governments issued too many bills of credit or failed to tax them out of circulation, inflation resulted. This happened especially in New England and the southern colonies, which, unlike the Middle Colonies, were frequently at war. [...] Pennsylvania, however, was responsible in not issuing too much currency and it remains a prime example in history as a successful government-managed monetary system. Pennsylvania's paper currency, secured by land, was said to have generally maintained its value against gold from 1723 until the Revolution broke out in 1775.|$|R

30|$|During the {{classical}} gold standard, aggravated levels of {{political or economic}} uncertainty manifested themselves in large deviations of the sight-rate from the mint-par (Clare 1902, p. 98). To uncover how the investment <b>demand</b> for <b>bills</b> of exchange reacted to such events, Table  3 splits the sample into observations within and outside (or on) the gold points. Of note, the vagaries to determine the gold points introduce an important caveat to this approach. Still, for observations laying outside the gold points according to the values reported in the “Exchange rates during the gold standard” section, the top panel suggests that the interest-parity condition as regards the London investment <b>demand</b> for continental <b>bills</b> of exchange {{can no longer be}} rejected for the case of Paris (whereas there is only a rejection at the 10 % level for the case of Amsterdam) 9. Although the London banker was, reportedly, “content with a safe and steady rate of interest” (Thomas 1921, p. 78), sufficiently large opportunities to make a chance profit did, perhaps, give rise to more active short-term investment activity in higher yielding bills of exchange on established financial centres such as Paris. Conversely, according to the bottom panel, the results of (3) differ hardly when distinguishing between observations within and outside the gold points. For the continental investment <b>demand</b> for London <b>bills</b> of exchange, where exchange rate risk was hedged, this distinction should indeed be less relevant.|$|R
5000|$|The Drug-Free Century Act was {{introduced}} to the United States Senate at the dawn of 1999.

50|$|After {{the studio}} system's {{collapse}} in the 1950s, actors and their agents fought for billing on a film-by-film basis. This, combined with changes in union contracts and copyright laws, led to more actors and crew members being included in the credits sequence, expanding its size significantly. As a result, since the late 1960s, {{a significant amount of}} the billing is reserved for the closing credits of the film, which generally includes a recap of the billing shown at the beginning. In addition, more stars began to <b>demand</b> top <b>billing.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Bill's gang {{included}} {{his brothers}} Al, George and Floyd, a brother in law named Adam Slagger, {{and two other}} unidentified men. Of the nine man posse, only Henry Barrett had any combat experience, having fought with Theodore Roosevelt at the Battle of San Juan Hill in 1898. At a place 300 yards away from camp, the posse dismounted their horses and tied them up to some trees in order to confront the outlaws on foot. The posse then headed to the camp from the west, which meant that the lawmen would have to fire into the sunlight if a firefight began. The deep canyon was shadowed and it provided a good defensive position for the Smith Gang. When the posse reached the camp, Tofolla, Hamblin and Bill Maxwell continued forward into a clearing to demand the outlaws' surrender while Barrett and the five others remained behind the cover or a ridge. After Bill Maxwell called out the <b>demand,</b> <b>Bill</b> Smith replied: [...] "All right, which way {{do you want us}} to come out?" [...] Maxwell responded: [...] "Come right out this way." [...] About this time, Barrett, who could see what was going on from the ridge, yelled out for Tofolla and the two others to lie down for cover, but only Hamblin took the advice.|$|R
