40|$|BACKGROUND: Depression is a {{prevalent}} long-term {{condition that}} {{is associated with}} substantial resource use. Telehealth may offer a cost-effective means of supporting the management of people with depression. AIMS: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of a telehealth intervention ('Healthlines') for patients with depression. METHOD: A prospective patient-level economic evaluation conducted alongside a randomised controlled trial. Patients were recruited through primary care, and the intervention was delivered via a telehealth service. Participants with a confirmed diagnosis of depression and PHQ- 9 score ≥ 10 were recruited from 43 English general practices. A series of up to 10 scripted, theory-led, telephone encounters with health <b>information</b> <b>advisers</b> supported participants to effect a behaviour change, use online resources, optimise medication and improve adherence. The intervention was delivered alongside usual care and was designed to support rather than duplicate primary care. Cost-effectiveness from a combined health and social care perspective was measured by net monetary benefit at the end of 12 months of follow-up, calculated from incremental cost and incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Cost-consequence analysis included cost of lost productivity, participant out-of-pocket expenditure and the clinical outcome. RESULTS: A total of 609 participants were randomised - 307 to receive the Healthlines intervention plus usual care and 302 to receive usual care alone. Forty-five per cent of participants had missing quality of life data, 41 % had missing cost data and 51 % of participants had missing data on either cost or utility, or both. Multiple imputation was used for the base-case analysis. The intervention was associated with incremental mean per-patient National Health Service/personal social services cost of £ 168 (95 % CI £ 43 to £ 294) and an incremental QALY gain of 0. 001 (95 % CI - 0. 023 to 0. 026). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was £ 132 630. Net monetary benefit at a cost-effectiveness threshold of £ 20 000 was -£ 143 (95 % CI -£ 164 to -£ 122) and the probability of the intervention being cost-effective at this threshold value was 0. 30. Productivity costs were higher in the intervention arm, but out-of-pocket expenses were lower. CONCLUSIONS: The Healthlines service was acceptable to patients as a means of condition management, and response to treatment after 4 months was higher for participants randomised to the intervention. However, the positive average intervention effect size was modest, and incremental costs were high relative to a small incremental QALY gain at 12 months.

40|$|The {{nature of}} gas and {{electricity}} and the methods of distribution, billing and payment all contribute to the 'invisibility' of much domestic energy consumption in industrial and post-industrial societies. For the householder, understanding how to invest and behave {{in ways that will}} give affordable comfort with minimum environmental impact involves making sense of a hidden set of processes. This poses a major challenge, one that a range of energy advice programmes is attempting to meet. The main focus to date has been on the actions taken as a result of advice, with little attention paid to teaching and learning processes or to context. This thesis explores formal and informal processes by which householders learn about their energy use in order to develop a theoretical framework. Constructivist learning theory guides the investigation and a variant of the 'conscious competence' model of learning is used as a starting point. The concept of'tacit knowledge' (foundational knowledge, usually acquired informally) is used in tracing the development of energy literacy. Empirical data come from householder surveys and from interviews of householders and advisers in five contrasting locations in the UK. Interpretation of this material demonstrates the construction of meaning through experience and interaction with others, and the potential role of the energy adviser as a trusted and knowledgeable person. The building of tacit knowledge is crucial to the development of energy literacy and the householder's ability to absorb and evaluate new <b>information.</b> Energy <b>advisers</b> {{need to be able to}} identify and develop existing knowledge, and to form effective networks with social welfare programmes. The need to build awareness by following up advice wherever possible is stressed. There also needs to be a supportive learning infrastructure that includes easily accessible feedback on consumption, and the availability of accurate information for those who are knowledgeable and confident enough to teach themselves. </p...|$|R
40|$|The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (as amended in 1970) prohibits {{mutual funds}} in the US from {{offering}} their advisers asymmetric "incentive fee" contracts in which the advises are rewarded for superior performance via-a-vis a chosen index but are not correspondingly penalized for underforming it. The rationale offered {{in defense of the}} regulation by both the SEC and Congress is that incentive fee structures of this sort encourage "excessive" risk-taking by advisers. Apart from affecting portfolio selection incentives, however, the fee structure also influences equilibrium welfare levels in two other important ways: (a) through its risk-sharing properties, and (b) through its potential at conveying <b>information</b> about the <b>adviser's</b> abilities. This paper examines a signalling model with multiple funds and multiple risky securities in which all of these effects are present. We find the incentives fees do, as alleged, lead to more (and suboptimal) risk-taking than do symmetric "fulcrum fees. " Nonetheless, taking into account the other roles of the fee structure, we find under robust conditions that investors may actually be strictly better off from a welfare standpoint under asymmetric incentives fee structures. In summary, we do not find much justification for the regulation. ...|$|R
