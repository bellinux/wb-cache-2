Second, the <b>free</b> <b>parking</b> space is detected by estimating the parking space orientation and the reference point in the top-view of the reconstructed 3 D structure. Experimental results show that the proposed method successfully reconstructs the 3 D structures of the automobile rearview and detects <b>free</b> <b>parking</b> spaces in the different environments. ...|$|R
