According {{to the new}} {{profiling}} {{characteristic of}} carbide pinion cutter with <b>convex</b> <b>curved</b> rake face, the machining process of <b>convex</b> <b>curved</b> rake face is designed, the special grinding equipment is designed and developed. Tool presetting and detecting equipment is developed by using laser sensor. It {{can be used to}} locate the initial location of grinding wheel precisely when <b>convex</b> <b>curved</b> rake face is machining. The tool path for CNC machining is solved. The grinding experiment is done for <b>convex</b> <b>curved</b> rake face of pinion cutter with 21 teeth and 5 modulus, different process parameters are established. The ideal surface roughness is obtained. The experiment result shows that the grinding equipment and tool presetting equipment are proper for machining requirements of <b>convex</b> <b>curved</b> rake face of pinion cutter. Intorduction In the mechanical transmission systems, hard surface gear is widely used. According to the machining of gear with special structure[1], for example, internal gear, duplex gear and so on, gear slotting is the only effective machining method.

40|$|Abstract. Tripod {{configurations}} of plane curves, formed by certain triples of normal lines co-inciding at a point, were introduced by Tabachnikov, who showed that C 2 closed <b>convex</b> <b>curves</b> possess {{at least two}} tripod configurations. Later, Kao and Wang established the existence of tripod configurations for C 2 closed locally <b>convex</b> <b>curves.</b> In this paper we generalize these two results, answering a conjecture of Tabachnikov {{on the existence of}} tripod configurations for all C 2 closed plane curves by proving existence for a generalized notion of tripod configuration. We then demon-strate the existence of the natural extensions of these tripod configurations to the spherical and hyperbolic geometries for a certain class of <b>convex</b> <b>curves,</b> and discuss an analogue of the problem for regular plane polygons. 1...|$|R
