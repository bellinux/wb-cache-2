500|$|Wilson {{stated the}} name [...] "Mr. Lady" [...] {{came from a}} trip to Italy while on tour with Team Dresch: [...] "I saw a store called Mr. Baby, and it freaked me out. Then {{everyone}} started calling me Mr. Baby. Then I became Mr. Baby onstage. I <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> theme song and everything. I wore a little eyeliner mustache. From there it changed into Mr. Lady, which just seemed like a good name for a queer label." [...] It also related to Ladyman, Wilson's first solo LP, produced with the aid of Melissa York after they both left lesbian [...] "supergroup" [...] Team Dresch.|$|E
500|$|In May 2008, Johansson {{released}} her debut album Anywhere I Lay My Head, {{which consists of}} one original song and ten cover versions of Tom Waits' songs, and features David Bowie and members from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Celebration. Reviews of the album were mixed. Spin was not particularly impressed with Johansson's singing. Some critics {{found it to be}} [...] "surprisingly alluring", [...] "a bravely eccentric selection", and [...] "a brilliant album" [...] with [...] "ghostly magic". NME named the album the [...] "23rd best album of 2008"; it peaked at number126 on the Billboard 200. Johansson later spoke of the opportunity she had to record the album, adding, [...] "I thought I would do maybe an album of standards, because I'm not a songwriter. I'm a vocalist." [...] She started listening to Waits when she was 11 or 12 years old. In an interview, Johansson said of Waits, [...] "His melodies are so beautiful, his voice is so distinct and I <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> way of doing Tom Waits songs." ...|$|E
500|$|In general, {{the world}} of these early volumes is a [...] " [...] and ... divided place." [...] In these early titles, the boys are cynical about human nature, an {{attitude}} apparently justified when the police, whom they have repeatedly helped, throw them into jail on slim evidence in The Great Airport Mystery (1930). The police and authority figures in general come off poorly in these books, {{so much so that}} at one point Edward Stratemeyer wrote McFarlane to reprimand him for [...] "grievous lack of respect for officers of the law." [...] The Hardys are less affluent than earlier Stratemeyer characters; they eagerly accept cash rewards largely to finance college educations, and, with their parents, strive to please their Aunt Gertrude, because she possesses a small fortune. The rich are portrayed as greedy and selfish. This view of the world reflects McFarlane's relative [...] "lack [...] sympathy with the American power structure." [...] In his autobiography, McFarlane described his rationale for writing the books this way, writing: [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> thoughts about teaching youngsters that obedience to authority is somehow sacred.... Would civilization crumble if kids got the notion that the people who ran the world were sometimes stupid, occasionally wrong and even corrupt at times?" ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} was filmed on August 6, 7 and 8, 1998, and was {{directed}} by Nigel Dick. After being chosen, Dick received criticism from his colleagues about wanting to work with Spears. He responded saying, [...] "It's a great song. I don't know anything about Britney. I never watched The Mickey Mouse Club. She seems like a great kid and she's very enthusiastic, but I just love the song. It's just a great song". The video's original setup was in high contrast to what eventually became the final product. The plan {{was to have the}} video in a cartoon-like environment, in a likely attempt to attract the audience of younger children. Spears was unhappy with this, and argued that she wanted her video to reflect the lives of her fans and wanted to set the video in a school. Spears pitched this idea to Dick, and further explained she wanted the video to have dance scenes. The original setting was scrapped and replaced with Spears's concept. Dick's original idea for the wardrobe was jeans and a T-shirt, but during the wardrobe fitting Spears decided to change it for a schoolgirl outfit. Dick said that [...] "Every piece of wardrobe in the video came from Kmart, and I was told at the time not one piece of clothing in the video cost more than $17. On that level, it's real. That probably, in retrospect, is a part of its charm." [...] The knotted shirt design was Spears's idea, she recollects saying, [...] "The outfits looked kind of dorky, so I was like, 'Let's tie up our shirts and be cute'". About the experience of shooting her first music video, Spears said, [...] "It was a wonderful experience. All these people there, working for you. I <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> trailer. It was an amazing experience". The music video was shot at Venice High School, the same school used to film the movie Grease. The video premiered on MTV and other video stations in November 1998.|$|E

2500|$|A {{few weeks}} before the rematch, Louis visited President Franklin Delano Roosevelt at the White House. The New York Times quoted Roosevelt as telling the fighter, [...] "Joe, we need muscles like yours to beat Germany." [...] In his 1976 biography, Louis wrote, [...] "I knew I had to get Schmeling good. I <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> {{personal}} reasons and the whole damned country was depending on me." [...] This time, Louis took training for the bout seriously, giving up golf and women throughout his training.|$|E

[...] I know, because I have <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> struggles. [...] The stage and screen have been good to me. [...] I have accumulated all the money I need, for a few years at least, and I am going to devote at least a year of my life to helping young men and women of talent who are denied the chance to display it." ...|$|E
2500|$|A rematch was {{scheduled}} later in New York City. In the build-up {{to the event}} U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt offered his support: [...] "Joe, we need muscles like yours to beat Germany." [...] Schmeling's hotel was picketed by American protestors after an accompanying Nazi Party publicist declared that a black man could not defeat Schmeling and that when he won, his prize money {{would be used to}} build German tanks. Louis won the rematch in a first round knock out and he became the focal point of anti-Nazi sentiment leading up to World War II. Louis later recalled the pressure on him before the fight: [...] "I knew I had to get Schmeling good. I <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> personal reasons and the whole damned country was depending me." ...|$|E
2500|$|The rematch between Louis and Schmeling {{would become}} one of the most famous boxing matches of all time and is remembered as one of the major sports events of the 20th century. Following his defeat of Louis in 1936, Schmeling had become a {{national}} hero in Germany. Schmeling's victory over an African American was touted by Nazi officials as proof of their doctrine of Aryan superiority. When the rematch was scheduled, Louis retreated to his boxing camp in New Jersey and trained incessantly for the fight. A few weeks before the bout, Louis visited the White House, where President Franklin D. Roosevelt told him, [...] "Joe, we need muscles like yours to beat Germany." [...] Louis later admitted: [...] "I knew I had to get Schmeling good. I <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> personal reasons and the whole damned country was depending on me." ...|$|E

2500|$|During World War II, Round {{became a}} fighter {{pilot in the}} Royal Air Force and was posted to Canada and then the No. 1 British Flying Training School in Terrell, Texas, serving as a flying {{instructor}} for the United States Air Force. He then began his performing career, later recalling, [...] "I was {{doing a lot of}} singing every Sunday in churches all over Texas. I <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> plane so I would fly down 300 miles to San Antonio for an 11 a.m. service, I would sing and then I would fly back home in the evening." [...] He also performed on the radio and was offered the chance to appear as a guest in a college production in Dallas, playing Canio in Pagliacci. [...] "It was my first time in any type of production but I loved it." [...] Round was offered a place at a music school in New York, but turned it down to return home to England in 1943.|$|E
2500|$|Several notable {{artists and}} musicians cite Milo Goes to College as a {{favorite}} and influence, including Mike Watt of the Minutemen, David Nolte of The Last, and Zach Blair of Hagfish, Only Crime, and Rise Against. Dave Grohl of Nirvana and the Foo Fighters opined that [...] "If the Descendents had made Milo Goes to College in 1999, they’d {{be living in}} fucking mansions. That’s a fucking amazing record." [...] Joey Cape of Lagwagon remarked that the album [...] "was just huge in punk and to me. I don’t think {{there would have been}} a [...] song like 'Angry Days' without that album." [...] Fat Mike of NOFX has cited Milo Goes to College as his favorite record of all time, and said that hearing the song [...] "Kabuki Girl" [...] on Rodney Bingenheimer's Rodney on the ROQ program on KROQ-FM was a significant moment in his youth. Chris Shary, who has done artwork for the Descendents and their successor band, All, since 1998, remarked that [...] "From the minute that I heard the beginning it was like 'this is the music that I have been waiting for. Photographer Glen E. Friedman, who photographed the band during the early 1980s, recalled that [...] "the album had just come out, and coincidentally I <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> little heartbreak as a teenager, and I heard that song 'Hope' and I gotta say that I had never in my life related to a song about love ever before until I heard that song [...] I was just 'Wow, this is fucking heavy.
