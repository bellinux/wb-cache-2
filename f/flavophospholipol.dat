40|$|Abstract The {{demand for}} pork and poultry {{products}} is {{strongly influenced by}} the consumers con-cern for healthy and safe food. The topic of food safety mainly concentrates on Salmonella con-tamination and is recently joined by the topic of antimicrobial resistance due {{to the use of}} antimi-crobial growth promoters (AGP) in animal feed. Recent research findings on Flavomycin (<b>flavophospholipol),</b> registered as an AGP for pigs, poultry and cattle, describe a reducing effect on the development of antibiotic resistance and on the frequency of plasmid transfer. <b>Flavophospholipol</b> does not induce an antibiotic resistance to antibiotics used for veterinary or human therapy as it is not related to any antibiotic used for these purposes. Furthermore, it is capable of reducing antibiotic resistance to other antibiotics. This effect seems to be yielded by interfering in the biosynthesis of the plasmid bridge (pylus) which is a prerequisite for the genetic transfer from one bacteria to another. Introduction The demand for pork and poultry products is strongly influenced by the consumers concern for healthy and safe food.

40|$|Antibiotic {{resistance}} in animal isolates of enterococci is {{of public health}} concern {{because of the risk}} of transfer of antibiotic resistance isolates or resistance determinants to consumers via the food chain. In this study, phenotypic and genotypic {{resistance in}} 192 pig isolates of enterococci to ampicillin, avilamycin, avoparcin, bacitracin, <b>flavophospholipol,</b> gentamicin, narasin, tetracycline, tiamulin, tylosin, vancomycin, virginiamycin, copper and zinc were investigated by susceptibility test and molecular methods. Resistance rates varied between the species but all isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, avilamycin, avoparcin, gentamicin and narasin but resistant to tetracycline and tylosin and intermediately resistant to copper. Only Enterococcus gallinarum and Enterococcus casseliflavus were resistant to vancomycin and virginiamycin resistance was present in less than half the Enterococcus faecium isolates. Zinc resistance was largely confined to Enterococcus faecalis but bacitracin resistance was uncommon in E. faecalis in comparison with the other species. Tiamulin resistance was common in all species except E. casseliflavus. Resistance to <b>flavophospholipol</b> was detected in most E. faecium isolates and in a high proportion of E. gallinarum, E. casseliflavus and E. hirae/durans but was only found in one isolate of E. faecalis. No tetO, rplC, rplD, vanA, vanB, vatA and vatD genes were found. The presence of ermB, tetL, tetM, tcrB, aac 6 -aph 2, tetK, tetS, vanC 1, vanC 2, lsaA, lsaB and vatE varied between the species and largely corresponded to the susceptibility phenotype. The findings show that resistance to antibiotics of high clinical significance for nosocomial Enterococcus infections is absent, whereas antimicrobial resistance was detected for some other antibiotics including bacitracin, <b>flavophospholipol,</b> tetracycline, tiamulin, tylosin and virginiamycin. ...|$|E
40|$|A “plasmid-curing effect” of multiresistant Escherichia coli by <b>flavophospholipol,</b> an {{antibiotic}} {{used as an}} antimicrobial growth promoter (AMGP) in animal feeds, {{has been reported to}} occur in vitro and in vivo under experimental conditions. In this study, the effect of <b>flavophospholipol</b> under field conditions was studied. The prevalence and degree (proportion of resistant strains to the total numbers present per gram of feces) of resistance of indicator bacteria, E. coli and enterococci, was determined in fecal samples from three groups of pigs that were fed a commercial finisher feed without any AMGP. Group A was the negative control group without any AMGP, group B received the same feed with 9 mg of flavophospholipol/kg of feed (study group), and group C received the same feed with 15 mg of avoparcin/kg (positive control). Fecal samples from each pig were collected at the start {{and at the end of}} the study and assessed for the prevalence and degree of resistance against antibiotics commonly used either for therapy in pig medicine or as an AMGP. Before the start of the study, all pigs were colonized with multiresistant E. coli by mixing three resistant pig isolates through their feed after disturbance of the colonization resistance of the intestinal flora by a 3 -day course of lincomycin and spectinomycin. At the end of the study, the overall prevalence and degree of resistance of E. coli in the fecal flora had increased significantly in groups A and C but remained at the same level as at the start of the study in group B. The prevalence of vancomycin resistance was 44 and 41 % in groups A and B, respectively, but only very low numbers of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) per gram of feces were found. In the avoparcin-fed group, the prevalence was 72 %, and in 57 % of the samples, more than 50 % of all enterococci present were vancomycin resistant. The prevalence of resistant Enterococcus faecalis increased only in the flavophospholipol-exposed group, from 23 % before the start of the study to 43 % at the end of the study. It was concluded that <b>flavophospholipol</b> effectively suppressed the augmentation and dissemination of multiresistant E. coli in the intestinal flora of fattening pigs. Avoparcin use strongly selected for VRE carriage and excretion. Therefore, as neither <b>flavophospholipol</b> nor any related molecule is used therapeutically, no cross-resistance with therapeutic antibiotics exists and no transmissible resistance has been shown; the major decrease in resistance in intestinal E. coli of flavophospholipol-fed animals seemed to outweigh the small increase in the risk of transfer of flavophospholipol-resistant E. faecalis from animals to humans via the food chain...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate bird responses to <b>flavophospholipol</b> at higher doses than those recommended by the Brazilian legislation. A trial was conducted with 900 male broilers divided into five doses of flavophospholipol: 0, 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg/kg. The performance evaluation was conducted weekly until 42 days of age. The evaluated parameters were: weight gain, feed conversion corrected for mortality, feed intake and mortality. At the end of experimental period, birds supplemented with growth promoter differed from the negative control for weight gain and feed conversion in the period from 1 to 42 days. Body weight gain and feed conversion were significantly higher for birds fed 16 mg/kg of <b>flavophospholipol,</b> compared with treatment without the growth promoter in the period from 1 to 21 days. In the accumulated period from 22 to 42 days, all doses were different for the negative control for feed conversion and body weight gain. The performance improvement was maximized at the dosage of 10. 1 mg/kg for feed conversion ratio and 10. 9 mg/kg for body weight gain by regression analysis.

40|$|Die Antibiotika der Moenomycin-Gruppe sind die einzigen bekannten Naturstoffe, die den vorletzten Schritt der bakteriellen Zellwandsynthese - die Transglykosylierung - durch direkte Bindung an die Peptidoglykan-Glykosyltransferase (PGT) hemmen. Aufgrund ungünstiger pharmakokinetischer Eigenschaften sind Moenomycine von geringem Nutzen für die Humantherapie. Ein Gemisch von Moenomycinen wird allerdings unter der Bezeichnung <b>Flavophospholipol</b> als Mastförderer in der Nutzviehhaltung eingesetzt. Die Verwendung von Antibiotika in der Humanmedizin und in der Tiermast trägt zur Bildung und Selektion antibiotikaresistenter Krankheitserreger bei. Daher werden fortwährend neue Antibiotika benötigt und die essentielle Funktion der PGT macht sie zu einem attraktiven Target für neue Wirkstoffe. Um der Bildung neuer Resistenzen entgegenzuwirken, ist außerdem seit 2006 der Einsatz von Antibiotika zur Leistungssteigerung EU-weit verboten. In dieser Arbeit ist die Entwicklung eines SPR-Biosensor-Assays (SPR: surface plasmon resonance) zum Nachweis von Moenomycinen und anderen PGT-Inhibitoren und dessen Anwendung für die Analyse von Futtermitteln und für {{qualitative}} Struktur- Wirkungsbeziehungen beschrieben. Der Assay basiert auf der Wechselwirkung zwischen der monofunktionellen PGT MtgA aus Staphylococcus aureus und einem immobilisierten Moenomycin A-Derivat. Der Assay erwies sich als ausreichend empfindlich, um praxisrelevante Konzentrationen an <b>Flavophospholipol</b> in Futtermitteln nachzuweisen. Die Eignung des Assays zur Futtermittelanalytik wurde anhand von drei verschiedenen Futtermittelmatrices untersucht. In zwei der Matrices war eine sichere Unterscheidung zwischen positiven und negativen Proben möglich. Im dritten Futtermittel führten Matrixeffekte zu falsch positiven Ergebnissen in der undotierten Matrix. Falsch negative Ergebnisse wurden nicht beobachtet. Außerdem wurde der Assay dazu verwendet, den Wirkmechanismus von PGT-Inhibitoren zu untersuchen, die das natürliche Substrat (Lipid 1 bzw. Lipid 11) imitieren. Alle Inhibitoren führten zu einer Hemmung der MtgA-Bindung an das immobilisierte Moenomycin A, was auf eine Bindung an die Donorbindungsstelle der PGT zurückzuführen ist. Bei niedrigen Konzentrationen der Lipid 11 -analogen Inhibitoren wurde allerdings eine erhöhte MtgA- Bindung festgestellt. Es ist anzunehmen, dass die Inhibitoren an die Akzeptorbindungsstelle binden, was zu heteroallosterischer Aktivierung der Donorbindungsstelle führt. Basierend auf dieser Hypothese konnten unterschiedliche Einflüsse der Strukturelemente der Inhibitoren auf die Affinität zur Akzeptorbindungsstelle abgeleitet werden: Die Disaccharidstruktur der Lipid 11 -Analoga ist essentiell für die Bindung. Eine Phosphoglyceratgruppe als Bindeglied zwischen Lipidrest und Zuckerrest führt zu einer höheren Affinität, als eine Phosphodiestergruppe. Die Peptidseitenkette führt zu verringerterAffinität. Der hier beschriebene Assay ist ein empfindliches Werkzeug für den Nachweis von Moenomycinen und die Identifizierung von PGT-Inhibitoren. Die vorgestellten Ergebnisse stellen den ersten Hinweis auf eine positive Kooperativität der Donor- und Akzeptorbindungsstelle von PGT dar. Die Erkenntnisse bezüglich der untersuchten Inhibitoren tragen zum Verständnis der PGT-Hemmung bei und könnten sich auf dem Weg zu neuen Antibiotika als nützlich für die Entwicklung neuer pharmakologischer Leitstrukturen für PGT-Inhibitoren erweisen. Moenomycins are {{a family}} of highly active (mainly against gram-positive bacteria) glycophospholipid antibiotics inhibiting the penultimate step in bacterial cell wall synthesis (i. e. transglycosylation). They are the only known natural substances inhibiting transglycosylation by binding directly to the peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase (GT). Because of poor pharmacokinetic properties, they are of limited clinical use. A mixture of moenomycins is, however, used as growth promoter in livestock breeding under the name <b>flavophospholipol</b> (Flavomycin®, Gainpro®, Pharmastim®, Jivet®). Use of antibiotics as growth promoters adds to the generation and selection of antibiotic resistant pathogen strains. Thus, utilization of growth promoters was banned in the European Union in 2006. The threat of emerging antimicrobial resistance caused by {{the widespread use of}} antibiotics in human therapy and animal husbandry leads to a constant need of new antibiotics. GTs are essential for bacteria, which makes them an attractive target. This work describes the development of a competitive SPR (surface plasmon resonance) biosensor assay and its application for analysis in feedstuffs as well as qualitative structure-activity relationship studies on GT inhibition. The assay is based on the interaction between a moenomycin A derivative tethered to the sensor chip surface and monofunctional glycosyltransferase MtgA from Staphylococcus aureus. It is capable of detecting 1 µg/mL <b>flavophospholipol</b> and 0. 5 µM moenomycin A, respectively. Moenomycin A needed for synthesis of the immobilized derivative was isolated from <b>flavophospholipol</b> (Flavomycin®) in high yields (> 70 %) and purity (> 99 %) by a procedure first described in this work. It comprises reversed phase semi-preparative HPLC under acidic conditions followed by desalting via solid phase extraction (SPE). The practicality of the assay for screening for <b>flavophospholipol</b> in feedstuffs was tested. Three feed samples were each analyzed unspiked and spiked at the lowest and highest reasonable <b>flavophospholipol</b> concentrations (between 1 and 20 mg/kg), respectively. Ground feedstuffs were extracted with methanol under elevated pressure and temperature by accelerated solvent extraction. Further cleanup was performed via solid phase extraction. The assay was capable of distinguishing clearly between positive and negative samples in two feedstuffs. In the third feedstuff, matrix interference lead to high SPR responses resulting in a false positive blank sample. However, false negative results were not observed. Furthermore, the assay was used to investigate the mechanism of action of GT inhibitors mimicking the peptidoglycan monomer lipid II or the lipid II precursor lipid I. All inhibitors resulted in decreased MtgA binding to the sensor chip surface indicating inhibition via the donor site of the enzyme. At low concentrations, however, some lipid II analogous inhibitors caused increased MtgA binding. These findings suggest that these lipid II analogs bind to the acceptor site as well, inducing a heteroallosteric activation of the donor site for moenomycin A. However, at high inhibitor concentrations, competition via the donor site outweighs the enhancement. Assuming that this hypothesis of cooperativity is true, differential effects of the analyzed inhibitors on enhancement of MtgA binding point towards the significance of different structure elements for binding to the acceptor site: The disaccharide in lipid II analogs is essential. Phosphoglycerate instead of phosphate as linker between disaccharide and lipid moiety increases affinity. A peptide side chain however reduces affinity. The assay described in this work is a sensitive tool for the detection of moenomycins and the identification of GT inhibitors. The results presented constitute the first indication of a positive cooperativity between donor and acceptor sites of GTs. The findings regarding the examined inhibitors contribute to the understanding of GT inhibition and might add to the development of new pharmaceutical leads for GT inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|Aim: An in vivo {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the effect of different levels of ethanolic extract of propolis, on growth performance, carcass traits, serum biochemistry, and humoral immune responses of chickens, {{as compared with the}} antibiotic <b>flavophospholipol.</b> Materials and Methods: 312 1 -day-old as-hatched broiler chicks (Ross 308) were randomly allotted to 6 treatments with 4 replicate pens per treatment. The 6 dietary treatments fed for 42 days consisted of a corn-soybean meal basal diet (control); control plus 4. 5 mg/kg <b>flavophospholipol,</b> and control plus 50, 100, 200, and 300 mg/kg ethanol extracts of propolis, respectively. Results: Neither propolis nor antibiotic affected the performance criteria; however, dietary treatments tended to enhance to enhance body weight and daily feed intake of broiler chickens compared with control group (p> 0. 05). None of the dietary treatments significantly altered feed: Gain though; broilers fed diet supplemented with 200 mg/kg propolis had better feed: gain values compared with other groups in starter, and grower phases as well as the whole experimental period (p> 0. 05). Carcass yield and internal organ relative weights were not affected by treatments on day 42, except for abdominal fat pad weight that decreased in broilers supplemented with antibiotic. None of the treatments significantly affected humoral immune function. Dietary treatments failed to induce any significant effect on serum biochemistry (p> 0. 05); though broilers receiving 100 mg/kg propolis had greater high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and lower triglyceride concentrations compared with other groups. Conclusion: In conclusion, the results indicated that addition of ethanolic extract of propolis to routine dietary components of broilers, such as corn and soybean, seems not to have a positive influence on performance criteria...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} avilamycin, zinc bacitracin, and <b>flavophospholipol</b> on broiler gut {{microbial}} community colonization and bird {{performance in the}} first 17 days posthatch were investigated. Significant differences in gut microbiota associated with gut section, dietary treatment, and age were identified by terminal {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (T-RFLP), although no performance-related differences between dietary treatments were detected. Similar age-related shifts in the gut microbiota were identified regardless of diet but varied between the ilea and ceca. Interbird variabilities in ileal bacterial communities were reduced (3 to 7 days posthatch) in chicks fed with feed containing antimicrobial agents. Avilamycin and <b>flavophospholipol</b> had the most consistent effect on gut microbial communities. Operational taxonomic units (OTU) linked to changes in gut microbiota in birds on antimicrobial-supplemented diets were characterized and identified. Some OTUs could be identified to the species level; however, the majority could be only tentatively classified to the genus, family, order, or domain level. OTUs 140 to 146 (Lachnospiraceae), OTU 186 / 188 (Lactobacillus johnsonii), OTU 220 (Lachnospiraceae), OTUs 284 to 288 (unclassified bacterial spp. or Ruminococcaceae), OTU 296 / 298 (unclassified bacterium or Clostridiales), and OTU 480 / 482 (Oxalobacteraceae) were less prevalent in the guts of chicks fed antimicrobial-supplemented diets.

Acid Lac is a new generation acidifier a combination of appropriately selected organic acids – Fumaric, Propionic, Citric, Formic and Lactic acids, with pronounced anti-bacterial effect. Two experiments were carried out with total of 126 growing pigs from 6 to 20 kg live weight to determine the effect of organic acids as growth promoters. The results of these experiments show that acidifying of feed for growing pigs with product Acid Lac in doses 0. 3 and/or 0. 5 percent, improves the average daily gain from 7 to 9 per cent, and better feed efficiency from 8 to 13 percent (P< 0. 05), decrease the number of pathogenic and relative-pathogenic microorganisms, compared to pigs with or without nutritive antibiotics <b>Flavophospholipol</b> in combined feed. Under the present investigation might be concluded that organic acids could be successfully used as growth stimulators, replacing nutritive antibiotics in pig diets...|$|E

On file IMPF: 02. 50 RONO: 1920 3008 Sponsorship: SEERADAims: The recent EU ban of growth-promoting {{antibiotics}} {{in animal}} production {{was based on}} fears concerning antibiotic resistance being transmitted to human pathogens. This paper explores the adaptation mechanism of a common ruminal bacterium, Prevotella bryantii, {{to one of the}} banned compounds, flavomycin (<b>flavophospholipol).</b> Methods and Results: Growth in the presence of flavomycin (2 and 20 ?g ml? 1) was characterized by a concentration-dependent increase in the length of the lag phase, which decreased after previous flavomycin exposure. From growth patterns on solid medium, decreased sensitivity appeared to be due to a whole-population adaptation. Proteomic analysis indicated upregulation of three native proteins occurred following flavomycin adaptation. Further analysis of two of these proteins resulted in no database matches, suggesting that they may be species-specific. Flavomycin adaptation also resulted in co-adaptation to bacitracin and vancomycin. Conclusions: Adaptation of P. bryantii to flavomycin, which also resulted in co-adaptation to bacitracin and vancomycin, may involve an increased availability of undecaprenyl pyrophosphate. Significance and Impact of the Study: The use of flavomycin, and similar growth-promoting antibiotics, in animal production may prompt adaptive responses in ruminal bacteria which can significantly change their antibiotic sensitivity.

A number of one-day-old broiler chickens (Ross 308) were allocated to five treatments, with four replicates according to a completely randomized design (CRD). Birds were offered either a corn-soybean meal basal diet (control), or the basal diet supplemented with 600 mg/kg of a <b>flavophospholipol</b> antibiotic, 100, 200, or 300 mg/kg coriander essential oil. At 42 days of age, two birds per replicate were selected for blood collection, slaughtered, and its intestinal microbiota and morphology were investigated. The results indicated that weight gain, feed intake, and feed conversion ratio significantly improved by the dietary inclusion of the coriander oil and antibiotic compared with the control treatment (p 0. 05). Birds fed the coriander oil and antibiotic diets had lower populations of Escherichia coli than control group in cecum (p< 0. 05). The dietary treatments influenced the morphology of small intestinal villi. Birds fed antibiotic and coriander essential oil presented higher villus height and crypt depth compared with those in the control treatment (p< 0. 01).

A total of 200 Ross 308 broiler chickens were allocated to five dietary treatments with four replicates of 10 birds each. Dietary treatments were prepared by formulating a corn-soybean meal-based diet free of antibiotics (Control) and supplementing the basal diet with three levels of MEO at 100, 200, 300 mg/Kg or antibiotic <b>Flavophospholipol</b> (FPL) at 600 mg/Kg. The results showed that diets supplemented with MEO and FPL increased the feed intake, body weight gain and improved the feed conversion ratio compared to the control treatment (P). The relative carcass weight was significantly increased, whereas the weight of gastrointestinal tract and liver were decreased in broilers fed MEO (P). Supplementing the basal diet with MEO increased the antibody titers against Avian Influenza Virus (AIV) and Newcastle disease Virus (NDV), although supplementing diet with 200 mg/Kg of MEO was more effective (P). Broilers fed MEO diets especially at the level of 300 mg/Kg had a lower white blood cells count and heterophil, heterophil to lymphocyte ratio, mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin, but a higher lymphocyte and red blood cells count (P).
