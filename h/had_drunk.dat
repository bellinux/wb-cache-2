5|$|Rumours {{circulated}} {{of a brain}} haemorrhage, {{followed by}} competing reports {{that he had been}} mugged and even that he <b>had</b> <b>drunk</b> himself to death. Later, there was speculation about drugs and diabetes. At the post-mortem, the pathologist found three causes of death– pneumonia, brain swelling and a fatty liver. Despite his heavy drinking his liver showed no sign of cirrhosis.|$|E
5|$|They {{arrived at}} the Andrew Johnson Hotel in Knoxville, Tennessee, where Carr {{requested}} a doctor for Williams, as he was feeling {{the combination of the}} chloral hydrate and alcohol he <b>had</b> <b>drunk</b> on the way from Montgomery to Knoxville. Dr. P.H. Cardwell injected Williams with two shots of vitamin B12 that also contained a quarter-grain of morphine. Carr and Williams checked out of the hotel; the porters had to carry Williams to the car, as he was coughing and hiccuping. At around midnight on Thursday January 1, 1953, when they crossed the Tennessee state line and arrived in Bristol, Virginia, Carr stopped at a small all-night restaurant and asked Williams if he wanted to eat. Williams said he did not, and those are believed to be his last words. Carr later drove on until he stopped for fuel at a gas station in Oak Hill, West Virginia, where he realized that Williams was dead. The filling station's owner called the chief of the local police. In Williams' Cadillac the police found some empty beer cans and unfinished handwritten lyrics.|$|E

25|$|In 2008 Mandelson was hospitalised, {{suffering}} from a kidney stone. At this time, melamine added to milk in China had caused kidney stones and other ailments in thousands of Chinese children, killing at least six. Ironically, during the previous week Mandelson <b>had</b> <b>drunk</b> a glass of Chinese yoghurt in front of reporters {{in order to show}} his confidence in Chinese dairy products, although his own kidney stones were unrelated.|$|E
25|$|On December 28, 1930, when Welles was 15, {{his father}} died of heart and kidney failure {{at the age of}} 58, alone in a hotel in Chicago. Shortly before this, Welles had {{announced}} to his father that he would stop seeing him, believing it would prompt his father to refrain from drinking. As a result, Orson felt guilty because he believed his father <b>had</b> <b>drunk</b> himself to death because of him. His father's will left it to Orson to name his guardian. When Roger Hill declined, Welles chose Maurice Bernstein.|$|E
25|$|Ince's autopsy {{showed that}} he {{suffered}} an attack of acute indigestion while aboard the yacht and was escorted off to San Diego by another of the guests, Dr. Daniel Carson Goodman, a Hollywood writer and producer. Ince was put on a train bound for Los Angeles, but {{was removed from the}} train at Del Mar when his condition worsened. He was given medical attention by Dr. T. A. Parker and a nurse, Jesse Howard. Ince told them that he <b>had</b> <b>drunk</b> liquor aboard Hearst's yacht. He was taken to his Hollywood home where he died the following day of a heart condition.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{a long-standing}} {{tradition}} of mead consumption, the beverage is a niche product in Poland. In 2013, about 600,000 litres of mead {{were sold in}} Poland, compared with 142.5 million litres of wine sold during the same period. Mead amounted to 0.5 percent of total alcohol consumption in Poland in 2013. Only nine percent of adult Poles polled that year declared that they <b>had</b> <b>drunk</b> mead {{at least once in}} the last three months; 27 percent said they had enjoyed mead in the last 12 months. Those who drank mead, did so mostly at family or social gatherings. A majority of those who did not, said there had been no occasion for it.|$|E
25|$|Stephan Cowans {{was convicted}} of {{attempted}} murder in 1997 after {{he was accused of}} shooting a police officer whilst fleeing a robbery in Roxbury, Massachusetts. He was implicated in the crime by the testimony of two witnesses, one of whom was the victim. There was also a fingerprint on a glass mug from which the assailant <b>had</b> <b>drunk</b> some water and experts testified that the fingerprint belonged to Cowans. He was found guilty and sent to prison for 35 years. Whilst in prison, Cowans earned money cleaning up biohazards until he could afford to have the evidence against him tested for DNA. The DNA did not match his and he was released. He had already served six years in prison when he was released on January 23, 2004. Cowans died on October 25, 2007.|$|E
25|$|By {{the age of}} 41 he had {{declined}} so far in health that his arms were {{by his own admission}} thin and weak. He suffered from bursitis, possibly aggravated by faulty treatment, arthritis, dermatitis, cirrhosis of the liver, and kidney disease, as well as developing, by his mid-forties, a pronounced limp. How much of this was due to his intake of alcohol is impossible to ascertain, according to Bragg, because of Burton's reluctance to be treated for alcohol addiction. In 1974 Burton spent six weeks in a clinic to recuperate from a period during which he <b>had</b> <b>drunk</b> three bottles of vodka a day. He was also a chain smoker, with an intake of between three and five packs a day for most of his adult life. Health issues continued to plague him until his death of a stroke at the age of 58.|$|E

25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} they inquired along seven lines before they {{determined}} that a genital discharge rendered a man unclean. A discharge caused by one of these reasons did not render the man impure or subject him to bringing an offering. They asked: (1) about his food, (2) about his drink, (3) what he had carried, (4) whether he had jumped, (5) whether he had been ill, (6) what he had seen, and (7) whether he had obscene thoughts. It did not matter whether he had had thoughts before or after seeing a woman. Rabbi Judah taught that the discharge would not render him unclean if he had watched animals having intercourse or even if he merely saw a woman's dyed garments. Rabbi Akiva taught that the discharge would not render him unclean {{even if he had}} eaten any kind of food, good or bad, or <b>had</b> <b>drunk</b> any kind of liquid. The Sages exclaimed to Rabbi Akiva that according to his view, no more men would ever be rendered unclean by genital discharge. Rabbi Akiva replied that one does not have an obligation to ensure that there exist men unclean because of a genital discharges.|$|E
25|$|On 29 January 1889, Franz Joseph and Elisabeth gave {{a family}} dinner party prior to leaving for Buda, in Hungary, on 31 January; Rudolf excused himself, {{claiming}} to be indisposed. He had arranged for a day's shooting at Mayerling early {{on the morning of}} the 30th, but when his valet Loschek went to call him, there was no answer. Count Joseph Hoyos, the Archduke's hunting companion, joined in, with no response. They tried to force the door, but it would not give. Finally Loschek smashed in a panel with an axe to find the room shuttered and half-dark. Rudolf was found sitting (by some accounts, lying) motionless by the side of the bed, leaning forward and bleeding from the mouth. Before him on the bedside table stood a glass and a mirror. Without closer examination in the poor light, Loschek assumed that the crown prince <b>had</b> <b>drunk</b> poison from the glass, since he knew strychnine caused bleeding. On the bed lay the body of Mary Vetsera, white, ice-cold, and already quite rigid. The mistaken impression that poison was involved, and even that the baroness had poisoned the crown prince and then killed herself, would persist for some time.|$|E
25|$|The {{suspected}} {{source for}} the epidemic was the Artibonite River, from {{which most of the}} affected people <b>had</b> <b>drunk</b> water. Suspicion among Haitians centered on a UN military base on a tributary of that river home to peacekeepers from Nepal. MINUSTAH officials issued a press statement denying the possibility that the base could have caused the epidemic, citing stringent sanitation standards. The next day, 27 October, reporter Jonathan M. Katz of the Associated Press visited the base and found gross inconsistencies between the statement and the base's actual conditions. Katz also happened upon UN military police taking samples of ground water to test for cholera, despite UN assertions that it was not concerned about a possible link between its soldiers and the disease. Neighbors told the reporter that waste from the base often spilled into the river. Later that day, a crew from Al Jazeera English including reporter Sebastian Walker filmed the soldiers trying to excavate a leaking pipe; the video was posted online the next day and, citing AP's report, drew increased awareness to the base. MINUSTAH spokesmen later contended that the samples taken from the base proved negative for cholera. However, an AP investigation showed that the tests were improperly done at a laboratory in the Dominican Republic with no experience of testing for cholera.|$|E

[...] He maintained that he had killed Lowe after the latter made homosexual advances that caused him to [...] "freak out"; he had previously fended off homosexual attacks twice while imprisoned: in Israel in 1978, and in England in 1994. When Deputy Public Prosecutors Jennifer Marie and Norul Rashid asked him what he did after killing Lowe, he said that he could not remember anything because he <b>had</b> <b>drunk</b> heavily and consumed Valium after Lowe's death until he was arrested. He repeated that he had not killed the Damudes, and that he had come back to Singapore from Phuket to clear his conscience about Lowe's death.|$|E
500|$|Mark Dennis QC, for the prosecution, {{argued that}} Harwood's {{use of force}} against Tomlinson had been {{unnecessary}} and unreasonable, and had caused Tomlinson's death. He argued that a [...] "clear temporal link" [...] between the incident and Tomlinson's collapse had been provided by the Guardian video, that Tomlinson had posed no threat, and that the use of force had been a [...] "gratuitous act of aggression." [...] The defence argued that Tomlinson's health was relevant. The court heard that he had liver and brain disease caused by alcohol abuse, numbness in his legs and balance problems, and that he had been treated at least 20 times between 2007 and 2009, mostly at A departments, related to falling while drunk. On the day he died, The Times reported, he <b>had</b> <b>drunk</b> a bottle of red wine, a small bottle of vodka and several cans of 9-per-cent super-strength lager.|$|E
