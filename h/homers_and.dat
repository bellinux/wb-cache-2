25|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home on Memorial Day and Ryu took a perfect game into the 8th inning against the Cincinnati Reds before allowing a lead-off double to Todd Frazier.

Andre Ethier homered, tripled and drove in four runs in the 6–3 win over the Reds on the 27th as Grienke struck out 11 in his 7⅔ innings. Brandon Phillips hit a two-run homer in the 1st inning and the Reds held on to defeat the Dodgers 3–2 as the series wrapped up. They lost again the next day, 6–3, to the Pittsburgh Pirates.

Eleven Huskers had at least two hits and seven had at least three hits.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home for another {{series against the}} Brewers. A bullpen meltdown led to a 6–3 loss in the first game, with the Brewers scoring five of the runs in the eighth inning. In the next game, Kershaw pitched a complete game, striking out ten and allowing only five hits.. however two of the hits were <b>homers</b> <b>and</b> the team lost 3–2. It was Kershaw's first loss in 14 starts. Dan Haren lasted just three innings as the Brewers finished off a three-game series sweep of the Dodgers with a 7–2 rout in the series finale. Carl Crawford had three hits in three at-bats with a home run and a stolen base as the Dodgers ended their three-game losing streak with an 8–6 win over the San Diego Padres on August 19.

25|$|Prior {{to their}} homestand against the Colorado Rockies, Dodger manager Joe Torre {{announced}} {{his intention to}} retire {{at the end of}} the season and that Don Mattingly would take over as the Manager for the 2011 season. The Dodgers followed the news with a 7–5 loss to the Rockies. Relief pitcher Octavio Dotel switched dugouts prior to the second game as the Dodgers traded him to the Rockies for a player to be named later. The Dodgers then proceeded to be blown out 12–2 as Troy Tulowitzki slugged two <b>homers</b> <b>and</b> Melvin Mora hit a grand slam, while John Ely was roughed up in the loss. The Dodgers fell behind 6–1 in the series finale, but came back to send the game into extra innings, finally winning the game 7–6 on a walk-off hit by A. J. Ellis in the 11th inning. The Dodgers two-year stay as National League Western Division champions came to an end on September 21 when they were officially eliminated from post-season contention when the Giants beat the Cubs. The Dodgers then proceeded to be shut out by the Padres 6–0, the first career shutout for Padres starter Clayton Richard and the 17th time the Dodgers had been shut out in 2010, the most in the league and their highest total since 1989. In the next game, Ted Lilly struck out eight in seven innings, but the Dodgers managed just three hits in a 3–1 defeat. The Dodgers avoided being swept at home due to Hiroki Kuroda's eight-inning, one-run performance in the Dodgers' 3–1 win over the Padres.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers next {{traveled}} to Miami {{to begin their}} road trip with a 3-game series against the Marlins. In his first game back since his trade to the Dodgers, Hanley Ramírez was 3 for 5 with 2 RBI and Juan Rivera homered as Kershaw picked up his 10th win {{of the season in}} the 5–2 victory. on August 11, the Dodgers left the bases loaded in each of the first two innings and left 10 men on base the whole game as the Marlins scored 4 in the 5th off Joe Blanton to beat the Dodgers 7–3. Chris Capuano did not allow a hit until the 7th inning in the series finale and left the game after 8 innings with only two hits and no runs allowed, as well as 10 strikeouts. The Dodgers won 5–0 as Ramírez drove in 3 runs against his former team. Shane Victorino homered and drove in 3 runs to lead the Dodgers to a 5–4 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates on August 13. The next night, Billingsley pitched eight shutout innings and Luis Cruz was 3 for 5 with 3 RBI in the Dodgers 11-0 rout of the Pirates. The Dodgers moved back into sole possession of first place {{for the first time since}} July 13, when Kershaw pitched 8 solid innings (3 runs, 8 strikeouts, no walks) and the team racked up a season high 15 hits in a 9–3 win. Matt Kemp and Don Mattingly were both ejected in the 2nd inning of the Dodgers 10-6 loss to the Pirates on August 16. The Dodgers spoiled a strong start from Capuano on August 17 when Ronald Belisario allowed the tying runs in the eighth inning and Juan Francisco hit a walk-off single off Jamey Wright in the 11th inning to lead the Atlanta Braves to a 4–3 win. Mattingly was suspended for the final two games of the Braves series as a result of his argument with the umpires in the final game of the Pirates series. With bench coach Trey Hillman leading the team as acting manager, the Dodgers only managed 4 hits against the Braves, but all of them were home runs. Hanley Ramírez hit two of the <b>homers,</b> <b>and</b> drove in 4 of the runs in the process for the 6–2 victory. The Dodgers wrapped up the road trip with a 5–0 win over the Braves. Billingsley pitched seven shutout innings in the game.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers next {{went back}} on the road to face the first place Milwaukee Brewers. Ted Lilly was again sharp, {{allowing}} just two hits in seven innings of work, but one of the hits was a solo home run by Ryan Braun. The Brewers added two more solo shots off Dodger relievers in the eighth and won 3-0 as the Dodgers hit into 4 double plays and a triple play and were unable to score against Randy Wolf. The Dodgers had another strong pitching performance from their starter the next day, as Chad Billingsley allowed only one run in seven innings of work, but the Dodgers were unable to solve Yovani Gallardo and the game was tied at 1-1 entering the bottom of the ninth. However, relief pitchers Hong-Chih Kuo and Mike MacDougal were unable to record an out in the inning and the Brewers recorded the 2-1 walk-off win on Mark Kotsay's bases loaded pinch-hit single. The Brewers won another pitching duel from the Dodgers the following day 3-1 despite another strong start by rookie Nathan Eovaldi. Tony Gwynn, Jr. hit his first home run since July 17, 2010 for the Dodgers lone run of the game. Clayton Kershaw helped the Dodgers avoid a sweep by pitching eight shutout innings to pick up his 15th win as the Dodgers won 5-1 on August 18. Kershaw became the first Dodger pitcher to pick up his 15th win before September since Hideo Nomo in 2003. Hiroki Kuroda finally got some run support, picking up the win in the Dodgers 8-2 victory over the Colorado Rockies on August 19. Rod Barajas hit a three-run homer in the third inning as Kuroda allowed two runs in six innings for his seventh consecutive quality start since the all-star break. The Dodgers blew an extra inning lead and lost to the Rockies 7-6 in 13 innings the next day. They had taken the lead {{in the top of the}} 12th on a solo homer by Aaron Miles and an inside the park homer by Trent Oeltjen, but rookie closer Javy Guerra blew his first save of the season. A walk-off single by Dexter Fowler in the 13th ended the game. Oeltjen's inside the park homer was the 1st by a Dodger since Blake DeWitt on May 6, 2008. James Loney had 4 hits in 4 at-bats on the 21st, including his 6th homer of the season. Chad Billingsley struck out 7 and only allowed 3 hits in 7 2/3 innings, but was victimized by two 2-run homers by Carlos González and Seth Smith and the Dodgers dropped the finale against the Rockies 5-3. With the win, the Rockies broke a 17-game losing streak in Sunday games, a Major League record. The Dodgers next started a three-game series on the road against the St. Louis Cardinals. Chris Carpenter blanked the Dodgers through eight innings, but the Dodgers rallied in the ninth as Aaron Miles hit an RBI triple off Fernando Salas to tie the score at one and then Rod Barajas hit a grounder to short that former Dodger Rafael Furcal bobbled to allow Miles to score with the winning run. Kershaw picked up his 16th win the next night, pitching six scoreless innings in the Dodgers 13-2 win over the Cardinals. Matt Kemp and Aaron Miles hit solo <b>homers</b> <b>and</b> Rod Barajas hit two homers as the Dodger offense had a rare outburst of power. The Dodgers won the final game of the series 9-4 thanks to a six run third inning and another effective performance by Hiroki Kuroda. The offensive outburst included the first career home run by A. J. Ellis as the Dodgers picked up their first series sweep of the Cardinals on the road since 1993. The Dodgers also moved ahead in the lifetime series with the Cardinals 1,002 wins to 1,001 for the Cards.|$|E

500|$|Kemp {{struggled}} defensively {{in center}} field during {{the first couple of}} months of the season, a problem that came to a head after a particular bad series for him against the New York Mets in mid-May. Manager Don Mattingly was openly critical of his outfield play following the series. Immediately afterward, the Dodgers made Andre Ethier the starting center fielder, and informed Kemp that he would be moving to left field. However, he was kept out of the lineup for five straight games as he was learning the new position, and was vocally unhappy about it. After playing in left for several weeks, he was moved to right field, a position he had not played regularly since 2009. He was more comfortable in right which led to the Dodgers moving Yasiel Puig to center field. The last week of July, he hit five home runs in six games to win Player of the Week honors for the fifth time in his career. He also won Player of the Month for September, when he hit [...]322 with nine <b>homers</b> <b>and</b> 25 RBI.
