History, co-produced by West, was released on June 21, 2005 on Universal South Records. The first single off the album, [...] "Next Thing You Know", was released June 20, a day before the album's release. The theme of the title track [...] "History" [...] {{was inspired by a}} R music news headline [...] "Matthew West Makes History", in reference to his first album, Happy. [...] "It's not <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>you</b> read a headline like that with your name in it that calls you a history maker," [...] he said. Beginning on September 14, 2005, he kicked off the 30-city History 101 tour, his first headlining tour, which included guest musicians Shawn McDonald and Paul Wright. He then joined tobyMac's Winter Wonder Slam tour, beginning on December 1, 2005, along with John Reuben, BarlowGirl, GRITS, and DJ Maj. Two additional songs were released off History as singles: [...] "Only Grace" [...] and the title track [...] "History".|$|E

[...] "I really, really, really want to see where [...] is. I just {{want to know what happened}} to her and where she went and what she's doing now. My idea is that she actually like figures it out, and finds some success and does really well in a different hospital. She was always floundering you know, and so she was always one step behind the eight ball and I want to see that girl take some power back." [...] She later went on to say that she regrets leaving the show, [...] "Oh yeah, sometimes, yeah. You miss it. I miss my friends. It was a great work environment ... and it becomes a family. I spent six years together with these people <b>every</b> <b>day</b> ... <b>you</b> grow up together, in a way," [...] and again commented on Izzie possibly returning to the show, [...] "I always felt that if they wanted me to come back and sort of wrap up that storyline ... I want them to know that I'm down with it if they want me to, but I completely understand if it doesn't necessarily work ... They've got a lot of story lines going on there." [...] But in March 2012, Shonda Rhimes said that there are no plans at the moment for the character to return, [...] "I think it was really nice to hear her appreciating the show. At the same time we are on a track we have been planning. The idea of changing that track is not something we are interested in right now." [...] Three years later, Rhimes said she has completely moved on from the idea of Izzie coming back, “I’m done with that story. I’ve turned that idea over in my mind a thousand times and thought about how it would go. And I don’t think so.” ...|$|E

Evans habitually had to borrow money from friends, and eventually, his electricity and telephone services were shut down. Evans said, [...] "You don't understand.
