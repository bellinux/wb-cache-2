40|$|An {{effective}} {{learning activity}} {{in a computer}} programming course is to study and practice computer programs. In order to help students to submit exercises and <b>to</b> assist <b>instructors</b> <b>to</b> mark programming exercises, a number of program submissions and assessment systems have been developed. However, these systems do not provide sufficient support for <b>instructors</b> <b>to</b> design exercises that can help students to study and practice computer programs in an incremental manner. With the primary aim to improve {{the teaching and learning}} of computer programming, we have developed a programming exercise management system, namely Programming Learning Web (PLWeb), <b>to</b> assist <b>instructors</b> <b>to</b> design computer programming exercises and to help students to study and practice programming exercises. PLWeb provides an integrated development environment (IDE) which is used not only as an authoring tool for <b>instructors</b> <b>to</b> compose exercises but also as a novice-friendly editor for students to study programs and to submit solutions. In addition, PLWeb allows <b>instructors</b> <b>to</b> use visualized learning status to assist students with difficulties. A plagiarism detection tool is also provided to deter students from plagiarism...|$|R

Karma Pakshi, 2nd Karmapa Lama (1203–1283)—the head lama of the Karma Kagyu lineage of Tibetan Buddhism—rejected Kublai's invitation, so instead Kublai invited Drogön Chögyal Phagpa (1235–1280), {{successor}} and nephew of Sakya Pandita, who came to his court in 1253.
