5|$|In an earlier, more celebrated case, Padfield v. Minister of Agriculture, <b>Fisheries</b> <b>and</b> Food (1968), a {{group of}} farmers pressed the Milk Marketing Board to {{increase}} the prices for milk payable to them, but the Board refused. The farmers complained to the Minister of Agriculture, <b>Fisheries</b> <b>and</b> Food under section 19(3) of the Agricultural Marketing Act 1958. Under the section, the Minister had power to direct that a complaint be considered by the Committee of Investigation {{but he refused to}} exercise the statutory power and provided no reasons for his refusal. The farmers alleged misconduct on Minister's part. The House of Lords held that a minister's power under an Act is not unfettered, and that the Minister in question had effectively frustrated the objects of the statute as his non-exercise of the power had been based on a misunderstanding of the purpose for which the power was given to him. Parliament must have conferred the discretion with the intention that it should be used to promote the policy and objects of the Act, and the Minister could not act so as to frustrate the policy and objects of the Act.|$|E
