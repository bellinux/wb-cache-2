5|$|The realistic-looking {{effects of}} the astronauts {{floating}} weightless in space and inside the spacecraft were accomplished by suspending the actors from wires attached {{to the top of}} the set, and placing the camera underneath them. The actors' bodies blocked the camera's view of the suspension wires, creating a very believable appearance of floating. For the shot of Poole floating into the pod's arms during Bowman's rescue attempt, a stuntman replaced a dummy on the wire to realistically portray the movements of an unconscious human, and was shot in slow motion to enhance the illusion of drifting through space. The scene showing Bowman entering the <b>emergency</b> <b>airlock</b> from the E.V.A. pod was done in a similar way: an off-camera stagehand, standing on a platform, held the wire suspending Dullea above the camera positioned at the bottom of the vertically configured airlock. At the proper moment, the stagehand first loosened his grip on the wire, causing Dullea to fall toward the camera, then, while holding the wire firmly, he jumped off the platform, causing Dullea to ascend back up toward the hatch.|$|E
500|$|While Poole is on a space {{walk outside}} his EVA pod {{attempting}} {{to replace the}} unit, Hal takes control of the pod, severs his oxygen hose and sets him adrift. Bowman takes another pod to attempt rescue. Meanwhile, Hal turns off the life support functions of the crewmen in suspended animation. When Bowman returns to the ship with Poole's body, Hal refuses to let him in, stating that the astronauts' plan to deactivate him jeopardizes the mission. Bowman opens the ship's <b>emergency</b> <b>airlock</b> manually, enters the ship, and proceeds to Hal's processor core. Hal tries to reassure Bowman, then pleads with him to stop, and finally expresses fear. As Bowman gradually deactivates the circuits controlling HAL's higher intellectual functions, HAL regresses to his earliest programmed memory, the song [...] "Daisy Bell", which he sings for Bowman.|$|E
5000|$|When Bowman {{recalls the}} events of 2001, he remembers the {{incident}} of chasing after Frank Poole's corpse in a pod without his helmet, and then entering the Discovery through the <b>emergency</b> <b>airlock.</b> This incident only occurred in the film. In the novel, HAL opens all of the pod bay doors and the <b>emergency</b> <b>airlock</b> to kill the crew when Bowman attempts to awaken them from hibernation.|$|E
40|$|The {{results are}} {{presented}} of the technical analysis of escape/rescue/survival situations, crew survival techniques, alternate escape/rescue approaches and vehicles, and {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of each for advanced lunar exploration. Candidate escape/rescue guidelines are proposed and elements of a rescue plan developed. The areas of discussions include the following: lunar arrival/departure operations, lunar orbiter operations, lunar surface operations, lunar surface base escape/rescue analysis, lander tug location operations, portable <b>airlock,</b> <b>emergency</b> pressure suit, and the effects of no orbiting lunar station, no lunar surface base, and no foreign lunar orbit/surface operations on the escape/rescue plan...|$|R
50|$|Pod Bay Deck: Along {{with the}} Pod Bay, the Pod Bay Deck also {{features}} an <b>emergency</b> <b>airlock,</b> circuitry storage bay, two fresh water tanks, a maintenance equipment room, an emergency shelter and space suit rack, emergency batteries for the centrifuge and pod bay, and a zero-g toilet.|$|E
50|$|The {{sequence}} in which Bowman re-enters Discovery shows him {{holding his breath}} just before ejecting from the pod into the <b>emergency</b> <b>airlock.</b> Doing this before exposure to a vacuum—instead of exhaling—would, in reality, rupture the lungs. In an interview on the 2007 DVD release of the film, Clarke states that had he been on the set the day they filmed this, he would have caught this error. In the same scene, the blown pod hatch simply and inexplicably vanishes while concealed behind a puff of smoke.|$|E

5000|$|En {{route to}} their next target (the Veil Nebula), the [...] "Dark Star" [...] is {{hit by a}} bolt of {{electromagnetic}} energy during a storm, resulting in yet another on-board malfunction, with [...] "Thermostellar Bomb #20" [...] receiving an order to deploy. With some difficulty, the ship's computer convinces Bomb #20 that the order was in error, and persuades the bomb to disarm itself {{and return to the}} bomb bay. Talby notes the malfunction, and decides to investigate the fault (to the complete disinterest of his crew mates), and discovers a damaged communications laser in the <b>emergency</b> <b>airlock</b> while the crew is engaging their next bombing run. While attempting to repair it, the laser malfunctions, blinding Talby and knocking him unconscious, inadvertently triggering a more serious problem, causing extensive damage to the ship's main computer, and damaging the bomb release mechanism on Bomb #20.|$|E
50|$|In the film, astronauts David Bowman and Frank Poole {{consider}} disconnecting HAL's cognitive circuits when {{he appears}} to be mistaken in reporting the presence of a fault in the spacecraft's communications antenna. They attempt to conceal what they are saying, but are unaware that HAL can read their lips. Faced with the prospect of disconnection, HAL decides to kill the astronauts in order to protect and continue its programmed directives, and to conceal its malfunction from Earth. HAL uses one of the Discovery's EVA pods to kill Poole while he is repairing the ship. When Bowman uses another pod to attempt to rescue Poole, HAL locks him out of the ship, then disconnects the life support systems of the other hibernating crew members. Bowman circumvents HAL's control, entering the ship by manually opening an <b>emergency</b> <b>airlock</b> with his service pod's clamps, detaching the pod door via its explosive bolts. Bowman jumps across empty space, reenters Discovery, and quickly re-pressurizes the airlock.|$|E

5000|$|A prince named Gorman {{fought with}} a dragon to save Henderland's princess Memory Mimori, but got {{captured}} by the evil magic of Joma and Makao (who are transgender magicians). Meanwhile, Miss Yoshinaga was telling a princess story to the Futaba kindergarten kids. The school organised {{a trip to a}} theme park called Henderland and all kids went on a train ride. But soon after, Shinchan got lost and met Cre.G.Mad (who actually was a werewolf). Shinchan then meets Toppema Muppet, a dancing doll. Shinchan winds her key. Just then Cre.G.mad transformed into a wolf and chased them. After escaping from him, they meet Chokirin, a subordinate of Joma and Makao. She has an erotic appearance which Shinchan gets attracted to. She and Toppema end up with a magical fight. Shinchan then leaves home. On TV, he sees the Japanese singer and model Akiko Hinagata who was singing [...] "Six Colors Boy" [...] song (which is the ending theme of this movie). At night Toppema meets Shinchan while he was taking a bath. She explains the evil plans of the transgender magicians and the witches, and requests him to help. Shinchan gets scared and refuses, but she left behind magical cards. Shinchan tested the cards and thought of Akiko Hinagata. She really appeared in front of him in a swimsuit, and Shinchan gets elated. Meanwhile, the witches sent Su Noman Par (a snowman with body temperature of -100 degree Celsius)to capture shinchan. He reached Kasukabe by train and knows Shinchan's address with help of Masao. He reached Shinchan's kindergarten and claimed to be a teacher. Shinchan met him in the washroom and gets scared. Later he saw him in his own house talking with his mom. His dad and mom talked with him till late night and drank beer. Just when all the bottles are finished, the snowman out of magic created two beer cans which after drinking, Misae and Hiroshi fall asleep (he had sleeping pills mixed deliberately).The snowman entered Shinchan's bedroom to capture the magical cards from him. Shinchan used the magical cards to call Action Kamen, Quantum Robot and Buri buri Zaemon to fight. (Buri zaemon at first took the rival's side and charged money,but after receiving few kicks decided to help them.) Their fighting techniques failed, but Shinchan's plan of rubbing their behinds against the Snowman's body worked. It started melting and it ran away, but left behind a letter inviting Shinchan's parents to Henderland. The next day, the parents and Shinchan went to Henderland. While returning, Shinchan's parents went to the toilet leaving Shinchan behind, and got caught by the Snowman, who sends two magic robotic puppets in place of them. While bathing, Shinchan gets scared when he sees that his parents' genitals were missing. Just then the two attack Shinchan, but in time he was saved by Toppema. She then explained that Shinchan had to go alone to Henderland to save his mom and dad from the evil clutches of the magicians. He practices the card magic and goes to Henderland alone by train. At first on the rail tracks he confronted Cre.G.Mad who transformed into a wolf. Shinchan used the magic cards to transform into a cable train and created a detour rail track which directly led inside the castle gate. Seeing the wolf chase him with a steam train, he again uses cards to call Action Kamen, Kantam Robot and Buri Buri Zaemon. Buriburi came up with a plan, and opened a way a to create an obstacle for Cre.G.Mad clash against him. Unfortunately, the plan fails as {{there was no one to}} change the way, but at the last minute Toppema changes the wolf's track and he falls into water [...] When the wolf was beaten, it loses its shirt and gets transformed into Hiroshi. Shinchan uses cards and for the second time Akiko Hinagata appeared in a swimsuit again (the thoughts of the person holding the magic cards becomes reality), and meets Hiroshi. Shin-Chan then transformed into a plane and began to fly over the park but they were followed by Chokirin. He called the trio superheroes but they fell down as it was to heavy to fly. Meanwhile, Toppema diverted Chokirin's attention and started fighting near a decorative globe. While Shin-Chan and Hiroshi recover from the fall, the balloon bursts and Chokirin only descends. She tries to take the letters to Shin-Chan but at the last moment Toppema appears, and thanks to power of the cards, she gets Chokirin wrapped in a halo of light due to which Chokirin gets destroyed but soon Toppema also gets weak and fades out. Shinchan cries and from his tears comes out Misae. The three are directed to the castle where Joma and Makao receive them with a dance show. After that Hiroshi becomes an executive salaryman, Misae in a refined housewife dress and Shin-Chan in a Kindergartener's uniform. They come forward to attack Makao and Joma but are repulsed with ease. Then they are challenged to a dance competition where Nohara family wins narrowly by 0.1 marks. Then they are invited to a game of cards which Hiroshi won with a great effort. But when Joma and Makao seemed to have some evil intention Shinchan used the Joker card and came out Majin, the spirit of wild, who stopped him and explained that to defeat Joma and Makao he must reach the top of the castle and place the Joker card in the center of the park. After a great persecution, Makao and Joma are destroyed and the castle begins to crumble. Luckily they reached an <b>emergency</b> <b>airlock</b> and escaped. Then Snowman Par apparently came to attack but princess Memory Mimori casts a spell. The Snowman melts and was discovered that it was the prince. She said that she was actually Toppema and thanked Shinnosuke for his help by him a kiss on his cheek. Then the princess and prince marry happily and Henderland becomes a happy place again. The ending song SIX COLORS BOY is sung by Akiko Hinagata, the Japanese model and singer, who made a guest appearance in the movie four times.|$|E
