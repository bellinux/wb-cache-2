25|$|The Democratic Party is {{supportive}} of LGBT rights. Most support for same-sex {{marriage in the}} United States has come from Democrats, although some favor civil unions instead or oppose same-sex marriage. Support for same-sex marriage has increased {{in the past decade}} according to ABC News. An April 2009 ABC News/Washington Post public opinion poll put support among Democrats at 62%, while a June 2008 Newsweek poll found that 42% of Democrats support same-sex marriage while 23% support civil unions or domestic partnership laws and 28% oppose any legal recognition at all. A broad majority of Democrats have supported other LGBT-related laws such as extending hate crime statutes, legally preventing discrimination against LGBT people in the workforce, and repealing Don't ask, don't tell. A 2006 Pew Research Center poll of Democrats found that 55% supported gays adopting children with 40% opposed while 70% support <b>gays</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> with only 23% opposed. Gallup polling from May 2009 stated that 82% of Democrats support open enlistment.|$|E

I consider myself a person who serves the people of Arizona to the best of his abilities."

[...] And the timing of the announcement of the Wood withdrawal detracted attention from the signing of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, the first legislative achievement of the Clinton administration. While a Gallup Poll showed that only 22percent of the public said that Clinton's difficulties in naming someone for Attorney General decreased their confidence in his ability to lead the country, overall, Clinton experienced the highest disapproval ratings at the start of any presidency since such polling began.

50|$|The webcomic {{has also}} allowed the storylines to become {{longer and more}} involved, with arcs that are carried {{sometimes}} over a month of dailies.

It has also dealt with the problems of relationships across international borders, as Elliot and Gilles bided out Elliot's application to move to Canada.

Helle Bering-Jensen, in the Washington Times, sounded a similar note, arguing that while most Americans “are quite happy to let other folks live the lives they please,” many “draw the line... at <b>gays</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>military,</b> gay marriages, gay parenting and so forth.” ...|$|E
