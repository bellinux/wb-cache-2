40|$|We {{present in}} this paper an {{allocation}} approach which considers the controller’s eflect on system delay to minimize the system cycle time. Most aUocation a~gorithms and conditional resource sharing methods emphasize minimum number of resources or area. Previous works have not modeled the resulting controller’s structure and its contribution to the system delay in a controUer/datapath system. Our allocation method generates a controller with minimum delay on the system’s critical path. Therefore the resulting system cycle time will be shorter than <b>other</b> <b>allocation</b> approaches. ...|$|R

50|$|Bayesian {{efficiency}} is an analog of Pareto efficiency for {{situations in which}} there is incomplete information. Under Pareto efficiency, an allocation of a resource is Pareto efficient if there is no <b>other</b> <b>allocation</b> of that resource that makes no one worse off while making some agents strictly better off. A limitation with the concept of Pareto {{efficiency is}} that it assumes that knowledge about other market participants is available to all participants, in that every player knows the payoffs and strategies available to other players so as to have complete information. Often, the players have types that are hidden from the other player.|$|R

It is shown that the set of tariff reforms that satisfy both rules (a) is always non-empty, (b) might include no reforms that end in world-wide free trade, (c) always includes reforms that are incompatible with free trade and (d) might include reforms that support a Pareto-optimal and Pareto-improving allocation but also support <b>other</b> <b>allocations</b> with neither of those characteristics. ...|$|R
