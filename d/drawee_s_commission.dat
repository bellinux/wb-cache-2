A primary area to come under the Commission’s microscope {{has been the}} right of the people to vote. Investigations by the U. <b>S.</b> <b>Commission</b> on Civil Rights, created by an act of Congress in 1957, have focused on complaints alleging the abridging of those rights through discrimination. Attorneys Gabriel J. Chin and Lori Wagner have compiled a significant 5 -volume set that details the Commission’s investigations concerning voting from 1959 to 2001. “No one can deny that the right to vote is a fundamental, inalienable right of all people in a democracy. Every other constitutional right depends upon it. Without this, we have only an illusion of true democracy; history has shown us that when this basic right is abrogated, democracy and freedom will fail. ” ——The Report of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>Commission</b> on Civil Rights — 195...|$|R
