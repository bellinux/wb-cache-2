In a research {{study in which}} over two hundred bacterial isolates were tested in European sea bass (<b>Dicentrarchus</b> <b>labrax)</b> larvae as potential probiotics, V. lentus was the most efficacious, being harmless to the fish larvae and giving protection against vibriosis caused by V. harveyi.|$|E
50|$|Applied fishing {{methods in}} the lagoon are fish {{trapping}} and gillnetting. Most caught fish species are gilt-head bream (Sparus aurata), {{thicklip grey mullet}} (Chelon labrosus), European seabass (<b>Dicentrarchus</b> <b>labrax),</b> flathead grey mullet (Mugil cephalus), thinlip mullet (Chelon ramada), sand steenbras (Lithognathus mormyrus), white grouper (Epinephelus aeneus) and sargo (Diplodus sargus), as well as blue crab (Portunus pelagicus). Average fishing Catch efficiency is given with 21.3 kg fish per hectare.|$|E
50|$|Mycteroperca fusca has {{a limited}} range {{where it is}} rare {{especially}} in areas which are subjected to heavy fishing pressure. A {{number of studies have}} shown a negative correlation between the abundance of M. fusca and the amount of fishing pressure, suggesting that overexploitation has significantly reduced the population. It may also be threatened by competition and parasites from the invasive non-native European seabass (<b>Dicentrarchus</b> <b>labrax),</b> which has escaped from aquaculture in the Canaries, and African hind Cephalopholis taeniops, which has thought to have arrived in the Canaries in ships' ballast water from West Africa.|$|E
50|$|The sea slug Chelidonura fulvipunctata was {{originally}} described from waters around Japan and is {{widespread in the}} eastern Indian Ocean and western Pacific. It was first identified in the Mediterranean in 1961 and {{was seen in the}} Red Sea in 2005, most likely as a result of anti-Lessepsian migration. In addition, a survey of polychaete worms in the southern Suez Canal found six species that were regarded as anti-Lessepsian migrants. Among the fish species that have been confirmed as anti-Lessepsian migrants are Solea aegyptiaca, Mediterranean moray Murea helena, comber Serranus cabrilla, European seabass <b>Dicentrarchus</b> <b>labrax,</b> and spotted seabass Dicentrarchus punctatus.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{fish species}} serve as vectors {{for the disease}} and have {{subsequently}} spread the pathogen {{to other parts of}} the world. [...] An example is the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) which is responsible for the spread of redmouth disease to trout in Europe. [...] Other vectors include the goldfish (Carassius auratus), Atlantic and Pacific salmon (Salmo salar), the emerald shiner (Notropis atherinoides), and farmed whitefish (Coregonus spp.). Infections have also occurred in farmed turbot (Scophthalmus maximus), seabass (<b>Dicentrarchus</b> <b>labrax),</b> and seabream (Sparus auratus). It can now be found in North and South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia, as well as Europe.|$|E
50|$|The parish {{church is}} about eight miles (12.7 km) south west of Penzance. The parish {{measures}} 2400 acre {{and the population}} at the 2011 census was 459.

From Nanjizal heading south and east, via Gwennap Head, there is 4 miles of coast to Penberth Cove and the boundary with St Buryan. The parish encompasses a number of small settlements which include Bottoms, Penberth, Polgigga, Porthgwarra, Trebehor, Treen (the chief village) and Trethewey. Both Penberth and Porthgwarra in the past had small fishing fleets despite not having harbour; the boats were hauled up the slipways when not in use. A small fleet continues to fish out of Penberth, for bass (<b>Dicentrarchus</b> <b>labrax),</b> crabs and mackerel (Scomber scombrus).|$|E
5000|$|The European bass {{was first}} {{described}} in 1758 by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus {{in his work}} Systema Naturae. He named it Perca labrax. In the {{century and a half}} following, it was classified under a variety of new synonyms, with <b>Dicentrarchus</b> <b>labrax</b> winning out as the accepted name in 1987. Its generic name, Dicentrarchus, derives Greek from the presence of two anal spines, [...] "di" [...] meaning two, [...] "kentron" [...] meaning sting, and [...] "archos" [...] meaning anus. The European bass is sold under dozens of common names in various languages. In the British Isles it is known as the [...] "European bass," [...] "European seabass," [...] "common bass," [...] "capemouth," [...] "king of the mullets," [...] "sea bass," [...] "sea dace," [...] "sea perch," [...] "white mullet," [...] "white salmon," [...] or simply [...] "bass." ...|$|E
5000|$|The European bass (<b>Dicentrarchus</b> <b>labrax)</b> is a {{primarily}} ocean-going fish {{native to}} the waters off of Europe's western and southern and Africa's northern coasts, though {{it can also be}} found in shallow coastal waters and river mouths during the summer months. It is one of only six species in its family, Moronidae, collectively called the temperate basses. It is both fished and raised commercially, and is considered {{to be the most important}} fish currently cultured in the Mediterranean. It is marketed under a variety of names, including [...] "sea dace," [...] "seabass," [...] and [...] "Mediterranean seabass," [...] among others. European bass can reach sizes of up to 1 m in length and 12 kg in weight, though the most common size is only about half of that at 0.5 m. Individuals are silvery grey in color and sometimes a dark-bluish color on the back.|$|E
50|$|Pasteurellosis is also {{described}} as photobacteriosis (due {{to the change}} in the taxonomic position), is caused by the halophilic bacterium Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (formerly Pasteurella piscicida).It was first isolated in mortalities occurring in natural populations of white perch (Morone americanus) and striped bass (M. saxatilis) in 1963 in Chesapeake Bay, USA (Snieszko et al., 1964). Since 1969, this disease {{has been one of the}} most important in Japan, affecting mainly yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata) (Kusuda & Yamaoka, 1972). From 1990 it has caused economic losses in different European countries including France (Baudin-Laurencin et al., 1991), Italy (Ceschia et al., 1991), Spain (Toranzo et al., 1991), Greece (Bakopoulos et al., 1995), Turkey (Canand et al., 1996), Portugal (Baptista et al., 1996) and Malta (Bakopoulos et al., 1997). Gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata), seabass (<b>Dicentrarchus</b> <b>labrax)</b> and sole (Solea spp.) are the most affected species in Europe Mediterranean countries, as well as hybrid striped bass (M. saxatilis x M. chrysops) in the USA. However, the natural hosts of the pathogen are a wide variety of marine fish (Romalde & Magariños, 1997).|$|E

European sea bass (<b>Dicentrarchus</b> <b>labrax)</b> is a Teleost fish of major interest for Mediterranean aquaculture.

40|$|The {{effect of}} dietary water content on <b>Dicentrarchus</b> <b>labrax</b> growth {{parameters}} {{and resistance to}} Vibrio anguillarum infection was investigated using commercial pellets with identical energy contents and different moisture levels. The first experiment hypothesis was that moisturizing pelleted ration {{can have an impact}} on <b>Dicentrarchus</b> <b>labrax</b> growth performance by the osmoregulation energy cost reduction. In a second time, the experiment explores the effect of water addition in pellets on the fish resistance to a disease. A specific device was built to uniformly moisturize dry pellets to different moisture levels, i. e. 8 %, 20 %, 40 % and 60 %. After an acclimation period and a 54 -day rearing period, the control fish had grown from 72. 7 +/- 17. 9 g to 133. 3 +/- 29. 4 g. No significant differences were recorded for fish growth parameters. After the growth period, the tagged fish were mixed and challenged by bath exposure to live Vibrio anguillarum in triplicate. After 7 days, mortality was significantly lower in the group of fish fed with pellets containing 60 % water. Adding water to <b>Dicentrarchus</b> <b>labrax</b> feed did not affect fish growth parameters but increase its resistance to a Vibrio anguillarum infection. The moisturizing process could be used to add specific compounds (such as probiotics or vitamins) to pellets just before fish feeding and could {{have a positive effect on}} fish rearing...|$|E

In total, 1406 fish were examined. High S. dicentrarchi prevalence was observed in all the farming systems involved in this survey (extensive farms: 51. 5 %; intensive farms: inland 59. 6 %, inshore floating cages 76. 2 %, offshore floating cages 41. 6 %) except for submersible cages (7. 4 %).
