Otherwise, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> {{them a lot of}} film 'the committee' takes over. They start juggling scenes around and taking out this and putting in that. They can't do it with my pictures. I cut in the camera and that's it. There's not a lot of film left on the floor when I'm finished.|$|E

We're {{going to}} go out and give 110 per cent-over four days of every Shield game. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> 110 per cent, you'll win a lot more games than you lose. I've been 12 months out of the game but if I see a ball I think I can hit, I will hit it... It's a big part of the {{captaincy}} so everyone knows where they stand. A happy team turns into a confident team and wins matches. But I have a hell of a lot to learn. It's my first shot at it and I will be listening to a lot of people. People who are willing to give advice and have a bit of a yarn.|$|E

500|$|It was screenwriter Joss Whedon's idea to {{incorporate}} Barbie {{as a character}} who would rescue Woody and Buzz in the film's final act. The idea was dropped after Mattel objected and refused to license the toy. Producer Ralph Guggenheim claimed that Mattel did not allow {{the use of the}} toy as [...] "They [...] philosophically felt girls who play with Barbie dolls are projecting their personalities onto the doll. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> the doll a voice and animate it, you're creating a persona for it that might not be every little girl's dream and desire." [...] Hasbro likewise refused to license [...] (mainly because Sid was going to blow one up), but they did license Mr. Potato Head. The only toy in the movie that was not in production was Slinky Dog, which was discontinued since the 1970s. When designs for Slinky were sent to Betty James (Richard James's wife) she said that Pixar had improved the toy and that it was [...] "cuter" [...] than the original.|$|E
500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it [...] "an {{unsurpassed}} episode. It's hard {{to know where to}} start dishing out the praise— Leonard Nimoy's guest appearance, the Monorail song, Marge's narration, the truck full of popcorn..." [...] Robert Canning of IGN strongly praised the episode, stating [...] "It is by far one of the most loved episodes of The Simpsons and can safely be called a classic by any fan. From beginning to end, there's joke after joke after hilarious joke. There's nothing in this half-hour that doesn't work, and {{no matter how many times}} I watch this episode, it never, ever gets old." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of Slant Magazine named it the show's best episode, stating [...] "It's the one you think of when you think of a Simpsons episode", and is [...] "maybe the show's funniest, and it most perfectly encapsulates what may be the show's overriding theme: People are really stupid and self-serving, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> them long enough, they'll eventually bumble toward the right answer." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the lines}} between comedy show and news show have blurred, Jon Stewart has come under {{pressure}} in some circles to engage in more serious journalism. Tucker Carlson and Daily Show co-creator Lizz Winstead have chastised Stewart for criticizing politicians and newspeople in his solo segments and then, in interviews with the same people, rarely taking them to task face-to-face. In 2004, Winstead expressed a desire for Stewart to ask harder satirical questions, saying, [...] "When you are interviewing a Richard Perle or a Kissinger, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> them a pass, then you become what you are satirizing. You have a war criminal sitting on your couch—to just let him be a war criminal sitting on your couch means you are having to respect some kind of boundary." [...] She has argued that The Daily Show success {{and access to the}} youth vote should allow Stewart to press political guests harder without fearing that they will not return to the show. In 2010, Winstead had changed her views, commenting that since 2004, Stewart did some of the hardest-hitting interviews on TV. Stewart said in 2003 that he does not think of himself as a social or media critic and rejects the idea that he has any journalistic role as an interviewer.|$|E

500|$|The lyrical meaning behind [...] "Give It Away" [...] is {{centered}} on the philosophy of selflessness and altruistic behavior. The song is titled after its most prevalent lyrical phrase [...] "give it away", which is taken from an experience Kiedis had with his former girlfriend—punk rock singer Nina Hagen—in the early 1980s. Hagen was several years Kiedis' senior and became a role-model during his drug addiction to heroin: [...] "she realized how young and inexperienced I was then, so she was always passing on gems to me, not in a preachy way, just by seizing on opportunities." [...] When Kiedis was looking through her closet he came across a jacket he liked, and commented to Hagen that it was [...] "really cool". Upon expressing this, Hagen immediately told him to keep it. Her reasoning behind this selflessness was due to an attempt to constantly make her life more enjoyable, and explained to Kiedis that [...] "if you have a closet full of clothes {{and you try to}} keep them all, your life will get very small. But if you have a full closet and someone sees something they like, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> it to them, the world is a better place." ...|$|E

He believed that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> a chicken-cock burnt brandy it could lay eggs, and that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> a boy burnt brandy it would stop his growing.

But if a Roman Catholic is jobless, and lives in the most ghastly hovel he will rear eighteen children on National Assistance. If you treat Roman Catholics with due consideration and kindness they will live like Protestants in spite of the authoritative nature of their Church".|$|E

Her attitude to women in music was contradictory: despite Lili's success and her own eminence as a teacher, she held throughout her life that a woman's duty {{was to be a}} wife and mother According to Ned Rorem, she would [...] "always give {{the benefit of the doubt}} to her male students while overtaxing the females". She saw teaching as a pleasure, a privilege and a duty: [...] "No-one is obliged to give lessons. It poisons your life <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> lessons and it bores you." ...|$|E

After the release, Game announced his plan on retiring from music, just {{to spend more}} time with his family and focusing on what's more important to him during the time. However, he later stated Interscope Records didn't want him to retire, and the label wanted him to come back and release another album, which was for February 2009. Game commented these statements about given was so far off his radar and that it was ridiculous.

2500|$|God condemns usury, and blesses charities. God dislikes every disbeliever, guilty.

O you who believe, you shall observe God and refrain {{from all kinds of}} usury, if you are believers. If you do not, then expect a war from God and His messenger.

2500|$|In January 1836, the unpopular {{government}} of the Duke of Broglie lost its majority in the Chamber of Deputies, and the King needed a new Prime Minister. As he had done in 1830, he chose a man he was certain would soon fail; [...] Adolphe Thiers. On the subject of Thiers, Louis-Philippe told Victor Hugo, [...] "He (Thiers) has spirit, but he is spoiled by {{the spirit of a}} parvenu; [...] he has shown himself to be insatiable." [...] Louis Philippe cited what he said was Talleyrand's view of Thiers: [...] "You will never make anything of Thiers, but nonetheless he will be an excellent instrument. But he is one of those men whom you can make use of only <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> them satisfaction; but he is never satisfied.

[...] Also according to Tsyganko, Văitoianu informed the group that they needed to coalesce with Romanian nationalists in front of Great Russian revivalism, and that [...] "the national idea takes precedence over everything", implicitly threatening Sfatul dignitaries.|$|E
