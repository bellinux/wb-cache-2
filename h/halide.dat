5|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognised}} that a range of sulfate and <b>halide</b> (primarily chloride and fluoride) compounds are readily mobilised from fresh volcanic ash.; It is considered most likely that these salts are formed {{as a consequence of}} rapid acid dissolution of ash particles within eruption plumes, which is thought to supply the cations involved in the deposition of sulfate and <b>halide</b> salts.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium(V) {{fluoride}} and protactinium(V) chloride have a polymeric {{structure of}} monoclinic symmetry. There, within one polymeric chain, all the <b>halide</b> atoms lie in one graphite-like plane and form planar pentagons around the protactinium ions. The coordination 7 of protactinium originates from the 5 <b>halide</b> atoms and two bonds to protactinium atoms {{belonging to the}} nearby chains. These compounds easily hydrolyze in water. The pentachloride melts at 300°C and sublimates at even lower temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from some}} minor medical applications, the first {{commercial}} use was the daguerreotype. In 1840, bromine was discovered to have some advantages over the previously used iodine vapor to create the light sensitive silver <b>halide</b> layer in daguerreotypy.|$|E
5000|$|Alkyl <b>halides</b> differ {{greatly in}} {{the ease with}} which they undergo the Finkelstein {{reaction}}. The reaction works well for primary (except for neopentyl) <b>halides,</b> and exceptionally well for allyl, benzyl, and α-carbonyl <b>halides.</b> Secondary <b>halides</b> are far less reactive. Vinyl, aryl and tertiary alkyl <b>halides</b> are unreactive. Below some relative rates of reaction (NaI in acetone at 60 °C): ...|$|R
2500|$|Lithium {{aluminium}} hydride also reduces alkyl <b>halides</b> to alkanes, [...] Alkyl iodides react the fastest, {{followed by}} alkyl bromides and then alkyl chlorides.

5000|$|Variations {{are based}} on the {{identity}} of X-R (often an aryl bromide) and M-R'. Often the reactions generate salts, or salt-like products (zinc <b>halides,</b> tin <b>halides,</b> silicon <b>halides)</b> ...|$|R
5|$|As {{with other}} metals with low atomic numbers, {{a variety of}} reduced <b>halide</b> cluster ions is known, the prime example being 4−.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the higher}} {{electronegativity}} of lithium, some of its compounds have a more covalent character. For example, lithium iodide (LiI) will dissolve in organic solvents, a property of most covalent compounds. Lithium fluoride (LiF) is the only alkali <b>halide</b> that is not soluble in water, and lithium hydroxide (LiOH) is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent.|$|E
5|$|Many {{types of}} ylides can be {{prepared}} with various functional groups both on the anionic carbon center and on the sulfur. The substitution pattern can influence the ease of preparation for the reagents (typically from the sulfonium <b>halide,</b> e.g. trimethylsulfonium iodide) and overall reaction rate in various ways. The general format for the reagent is shown on the right.|$|E
40|$|Using excited-state {{ab initio}} {{molecular}} dynamics simulations employing the complete-active-space self-consistent-field approach, we study {{the mechanism of}} photodissociation {{in terms of time}} evolution of structure, kinetic energy, charges and potential energy for the first excited state of hydrogen <b>halides</b> and methyl <b>halides.</b> Although the hydrogen <b>halides</b> and methyl <b>halides</b> are similar in the photodissociation mechanism, their dynamics are slightly different. The presence of the methyl group causes delay in photodissociation as compared to hydrogen <b>halides...</b>|$|R

50|$|The Wurtz-Fittig {{reaction}} is the chemical reaction of aryl <b>halides</b> with alkyl <b>halides</b> and sodium metal {{in the presence}} of dry ether to give substituted aromatic compounds.The {{reaction is}} named after Charles-Adolphe Wurtz, who discovered in 1855 a similar reaction between two alkyl <b>halides</b> (Wurtz reaction), and Rudolph Fittig, who discovered that aryl <b>halides</b> also undergo this reaction.|$|R
5|$|The {{components}} {{are placed in}} a tantalum crucible and fired in a helium atmosphere. As the reaction progresses, the resulting <b>halide</b> compounds and molten dysprosium separate {{due to differences in}} density. When the mixture cools, the dysprosium can be cut away from the impurities.|$|E
5|$|Berkelium(III) ions shows two sharp {{fluorescence}} peaks at 652nanometers (red light) and 742nanometers (deep red – near infrared) due {{to internal}} transitions at the f-electron shell. The relative intensity of these peaks {{depends on the}} excitation power and temperature of the sample. This emission can be observed, for example, after dispersing berkelium ions in a silicate glass, by melting the glass in presence of berkelium oxide or <b>halide.</b>|$|E
5|$|Elemental bromine is very {{reactive}} {{and thus}} {{does not occur}} free in nature, but in colourless soluble crystalline mineral <b>halide</b> salts, analogous to table salt. While it is rather rare in the Earth's crust, the high solubility of the bromide ion (Br−) has caused its accumulation in the oceans. Commercially the element is easily extracted from brine pools, mostly in the United States, Israel and China. The mass of bromine in the oceans is about one three-hundredth of that of chlorine.|$|E

2500|$|Ethanol is {{not used}} industrially as a {{precursor}} to ethyl <b>halides,</b> but the reactions are illustrative. Ethanol reacts with hydrogen <b>halides</b> to produce ethyl <b>halides</b> such as ethyl chloride and ethyl bromide via an SN2 reaction: ...|$|R
40|$|Unimolecular {{decomposition}} kinetics {{of selected}} ethyl <b>halides,</b> phenethyl <b>halides</b> and methoxyphenethyl <b>halides</b> {{have been investigated}} using high level computational chemistry methods. The phenethyl <b>halides</b> decompose faster than the ethyl <b>halides</b> due to a more electronegative chlorine atom, induced by the chloroethyl functionality as an electron-withdrawing group. 1 -Chloro- 2 -(methylthio) ethane exhibits faster dehydrochlorination than that of chloroethane/ 1 -chloro- 2 -methoxyethane, owing to more polarisable C⋯H and C⋯Cl bonds in the transition structures. Calculations suggest that electronic factors rather than anchimeric assistance influence the dehydrochlorination reactions...|$|R
5|$|Lead dihalides are well-characterized; this {{includes}} the diastatide, and mixed halides, such as PbFCl. The relative insolubility of the latter forms a useful basis for the gravimetric determination of fluorine. The difluoride was the first solid ionically conducting compound to be discovered (in 1834, by Michael Faraday). The other dihalides decompose on exposure to ultraviolet or visible light, especially the diiodide. Many lead pseudohalides are known. Lead(II) forms an extensive variety of <b>halide</b> coordination complexes, such as 2−, 4−, and the n5n− chain anion.|$|E
5|$|Metallic gallium is not toxic. However, {{exposure}} to gallium <b>halide</b> complexes {{can result in}} acute toxicity. The Ga3+ ion of soluble gallium salts tends to form the insoluble hydroxide when injected in large doses; precipitation of this hydroxide resulted in renal toxicity in animals. In lower doses, soluble gallium is tolerated well and does not accumulate as a poison, instead being excreted mostly through urine. Excretion of gallium occurs in two phases: the first phase has a biological half-life of one hour while the second has a biological half-life of twenty-five hours.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium(IV) forms a {{tetrahedral}} complex tetrakis(cyclopentadienyl)protactinium(IV) (or Pa(C5H5)4) {{with four}} cyclopentadienyl rings, {{which can be}} synthesized by reacting protactinium(IV) chloride with molten Be(C5H5)2. One ring can be substituted with a <b>halide</b> atom. Another organometallic complex is golden-yellow bis(π-cyclooctatetraene) protactinium, or protactinocene, Pa(C8H8)2, which is analogous in structure to uranocene. There, the metal atom is sandwiched between two cyclooctatetraene ligands. Similar to uranocene, it can be prepared by reacting protactinium tetrachloride with dipotassium cyclooctatetraenide, K2C8H8, in tetrahydrofuran.|$|E

5|$|Surface {{diffusion}} {{rates and}} mechanisms {{are affected by}} a variety of factors including the strength of the surface-adparticle bond, orientation of the surface lattice, attraction and repulsion between surface species and chemical potential gradients. It is an important concept in surface phase formation, epitaxial growth, heterogeneous catalysis, and other topics in surface science. As such, the principles of surface diffusion are critical for the chemical production and semiconductor industries. Real-world applications relying heavily on these phenomena include catalytic converters, integrated circuits used in electronic devices, and silver <b>halide</b> salts used in photographic film.|$|E
5|$|The highest known {{ruthenium}} <b>halide</b> is the hexafluoride, a {{dark brown}} solid that melts at 54°C. It hydrolyzes violently upon contact {{with water and}} easily disproportionates to form a mixture of lower ruthenium fluorides, releasing fluorine gas. Ruthenium pentafluoride is a tetrameric dark green solid that is also readily hydrolyzed, melting at 86.5°C. The yellow ruthenium tetrafluoride is probably also polymeric and can be formed by reducing the pentafluoride with iodine. Among the binary compounds of ruthenium, these high oxidation states are known only in the oxides and fluorides.|$|E
5|$|As {{reflected}} in the table above, samarium halides change their crystal structures when one type of <b>halide</b> atoms is substituted for another, which is an uncommon behavior for most elements (e.g. actinides). Many halides have two major crystal phases for one composition, one being significantly more stable and another being metastable. The latter is formed upon compression or heating, followed by quenching to ambient conditions. For example, compressing the usual monoclinic samarium diiodide and releasing the pressure results in a PbCl2-type orthorhombic structure (density 5.90 g/cm3), and similar treatment results in a new phase of samarium triiodide (density 5.97 g/cm3).|$|E
50|$|Like many metal carbonyls, dicobalt octacarbonyl abstracts <b>halides</b> from alkyl <b>halides.</b> Upon {{reaction}} with bromoform, it {{converts to}} methylidynetricobaltnonacarbonyl, HCCo3(CO)9.|$|R

25|$|Being a good nucleophile, N2H4 can attack sulfonyl <b>halides</b> and acyl <b>halides.</b> The tosylhydrazine also forms hydrazones upon {{treatment}} with carbonyls.|$|R
5|$|In {{its natural}} habitat, N. rajah grows in open areas, {{where it is}} exposed to direct {{sunlight}} – it therefore needs to be provided with {{a significant amount of}} light in cultivation as well. To meet this need, many growers have used metal <b>halide</b> lamps in the 500–1000watt range, with considerable success. The plant should be situated a fair distance from the light source, 1 to 2 m is recommended. Depending on location, growers can utilise natural sunlight as a source of illumination. However, this is only recommended for those living in equatorial regions, where light intensity is sufficient to satisfy the needs of the plant. A photoperiod of 12hours is comparable to that experienced in nature, since Borneo lies on the equator.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{fluoride}} is {{the only}} alkali metal <b>halide</b> that is poorly soluble in water, and lithium hydroxide {{is the only}} alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent. Conversely, lithium perchlorate and other lithium salts with large anions that cannot be polarised are much more stable than the analogous compounds of the other alkali metals, probably because Li+ has a high solvation energy. This effect also means that most simple lithium salts are commonly encountered in hydrated form, because the anhydrous forms are extremely hygroscopic: this allows salts like lithium chloride and lithium bromide {{to be used in}} dehumidifiers and air-conditioners.|$|E
5|$|Organic mercury {{compounds}} are historically important but are of little industrial {{value in the}} western world. Mercury(II) salts are a rare example of simple metal complexes that react directly with aromatic rings. Organo{{mercury compounds}} are always divalent and usually two-coordinate and linear geometry. Unlike organocadmium and organozinc compounds, organomercury compounds do not react with water. They usually have the formula HgR2, which are often volatile, or HgRX, which are often solids, where R is aryl or alkyl and X is usually <b>halide</b> or acetate. Methylmercury, a generic term for compounds with the formula CH3HgX, is a dangerous family of compounds that are often found in polluted water. They arise by {{a process known as}} biomethylation.|$|E
