2500|$|INA's first fire {{insurance}} policy went to William Beynroth on [...] "German Dry Goods" [...] {{at his house}} at 211 High Street (today Market Street) in Philadelphia. INA's first <b>fire</b> <b>mark</b> was a six-pointed star, made with lead and mounted on a wooden shield; in 1796, INA adopted a new mark, of an eagle rising from a rock. Variations of this image would symbolize the company until the 1950s.|$|E
2500|$|The Tragedy of Arthur {{operates}} {{in the tradition}} of other works, such as Vladimir Nabokov's Pale <b>Fire,</b> <b>Mark</b> Z. Danielewski's House of Leaves, Lemony Snicket's writings, and Orson Welles' [...] "documentary" [...] F For Fake in how it distorts reader expectations as far as [...] "fiction" [...] and [...] "truth." [...] A.E.H. Phillips' schemes also include art forgery, and the novel references the van Meegeren Vermeer forgeries. In particular, it shares a structural similarity to Pale Fire, which is a novel {{in the form of a}} foreword to and commentary on a poem by the fictional John Shade by an academic colleague. Like Pale Fire, The Tragedy of Arthur is also a satire of academia, though Phillips' novel, of course, focuses its parody specifically on Shakespeare studies.|$|E

50|$|The Coat of Arms for Gamma Iota Sigma is in {{the shape}} of what is known as a <b>fire</b> <b>mark.</b> Fire marks were made of iron and placed on the {{exterior}} of the buildings on insured properties so as to identify the specific fire company that, {{in the event of a}} fire, would serve to extinguish it. The <b>fire</b> <b>mark</b> is decorated with the symbol of the four clasped right hands. Each hand is representative of one of the four ideals upon which the fraternity is based: friendship, knowledge, integrity, and fidelity.

Each company had its own <b>fire</b> <b>mark,</b> a durable plaque that would be affixed to the building exterior.

40|$|<b>Firing</b> pin <b>marks</b> {{are most}} {{important}} forensic evidences in firearm identification, Howeveq there are no general guidelines available for optical imaging, processing, and analyzing the images of <b>firing</b> pin <b>marks</b> for firearm identification, In this respect, the further development for firearm identification is highly demanded from both theoretical and practical point of view. This paper aims {{to address the problem}} of <b>firing</b> pin <b>marks</b> identification. A novel approach is proposed for measuring the similarity of <b>firing</b> pin <b>marks</b> in terms of their co-occurrencefeature descriptors. In doing so, the markings on the surface of cartridge case are captured by a CCD camera. After extracting the firing pin imagesn we calculate the co-occurrence feature sets of the firing pin images. Then we can classify the firing pin images based on the relative distances between sample images. The experimental results indicate that the <b>firing</b> pin <b>marks</b> can be preciously classified in terms of their co-occurrence features...|$|R
