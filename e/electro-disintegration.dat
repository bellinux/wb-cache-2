40|$|Photo- and <b>electro-disintegration</b> {{techniques}} have been traditionally used for studying giant dipole resonances and through them nuclear structure. Over a long period, detailed theoretical {{models for the}} giant dipole resonances were proposed and low energy electron accelerators were constructed to perform experiments to test their veracity.

We discuss here the possibility of inducing <b>electro-disintegration</b> of nuclei through such devices.

The recent {{experimental}} {{program with}} the out-of-plane spectrometer system (OOPS) at MIT-Bates encompassed an extensive set of d(⃗e,e ′ p) measurements, investigations of the N → ∆ transition using p(⃗e,e ′ p) π 0 and p(⃗e,e ′ π +) n reaction channels, and studies of virtual Compton scattering (VCS) p(e,e ′ p) γ below the pion threshold. Preliminary results are presented. Measurements of d(⃗e,e ′ p) in the dip region Early measurements of unpolarised responses for deuteron <b>electro-disintegration</b> have yielded a substantial, but inconsistent body of data {{which could not be}} adequately described by theoretical models (see [1] for a review). To provide a richer input to theories, the deuteron program at Bates has been dedicated to separations of interference responses in a variety of kinematical settings. This could be achieved by simultaneous out-of-plane detection of ejected hadrons about the momentum transfer, thereby minimising systematic uncertainties and allowing for separation of both asymmetries and absolute responses [2, 3].

It will allow an unprecedented access to the dynamics of the repulsive core. Presently the phenomenology of hard exclusive two-body baryonic scattering[1] indicates the dominance of quark-interchange mechanisms of scattering at sub-fermi distances.

40|$|Differential cross {{sections}} for the <b>electro-disintegration</b> process e + ^ 4 He⟶^ 3 H+ p + e' are calculated, using {{a model in}} which the final state interaction is included {{by means of a}} nucleon-nucleus (3 + 1) potential constructed via Marchenko inversion. The required bound-state wave functions are calculated within the integrodifferential equation approach (IDEA). In our model the important condition that the initial bound state and the final scattering state are orthogonal is fulfilled. The sensitivity of the cross section to the input p^ 3 H interaction in certain kinematical regions is investigated. The approach adopted could be useful in reactions involving few cluster systems where effective interactions are not well known and exact methods are presently unavailable. Although, our Plane-Wave Impulse Approximation results exhibit, similarly to other calculations, a dip in the five-fold differential cross-section around a missing momentum of ∼ 450 MeV/c, it is argued that this is an artifact of the omission of re-scattering four-nucleon processes.

40|$|We {{review the}} present {{status of the}} theory of high energy {{reactions}} with semi-exclusive nucleon electro-production from nuclear targets. We demonstrate how the increase of transferred energies in these reactions opens a complete new window in studying the microscopic nuclear structure at small distances. The simplifications in theoretical descriptions associated with the increase of the energies are discussed. The theoretical framework for calculation of high energy nuclear reactions based on the effective Feynman diagram rules is described in details. The result of this approach is the generalized eikonal approximation (GEA), which is reduced to Glauber approximation when nucleon recoil is neglected. The method of GEA is demonstrated in the calculation of high energy <b>electro-disintegration</b> of the deuteron and A = 3 targets. Subsequently we generalize the obtained formulae for A> 3 nuclei. The relation of GEA to the Glauber theory is analyzed.

In the cumulative region the FFT effects which result from the real part of the ejectile propagator are taken into account. It is found that the relative weight of the rescattering steadily grows with x becoming of the order of unity at x> 1. 4 1. 5. At such values of x the finite formation time effects become fairly visible, which may serve for their study at relatively small value of the four-momentum transferQ^ 2.

To have {{an estimate of}} the model dependence for the various predictions, a number of different, latest-generation strong-interaction potentials [...] Argonne v 18, Bonn 2000, and Nijmegen I [...] are used in combination with a weak-interaction potential consisting of pi-, rho-, and omega-meson exchanges [...] the model known as DDH. The complete bound and scattering problems in the presence of parity-conserving, including electromagnetic, and parity-violating potentials is solved in both configuration and momentum space. The issue of electromagnetic current conservation is examined carefully. We find large cancellations between the asymmetries induced by the parity-violating interactions and those arising from the associated pion-exchange currents.

Formalism When a proton is knocked out off a nucleus in quasi-elastic inclusive (A(e, e ′) X) {{and exclusive}} (A(e, e ′ p) B) processes at high values of the momentum transfer Q 2, the Final State Interaction (FSI) can be described within the eikonal Glauber approach. Recently such an approach to FSI has been extended so as {{to take into account}} the virtuality of the hit nucleon after γ ∗ absorption [1]. It has been found that because of the FFT the hit proton needs to reach its asymptotic state, the FSI with the spectator A − 1 nucleons becomes very weak and vanishes in the asymptotic limit. Although the physical process underlying the vanishing of the FSI at large Q 2 is the same which appears in colour transparency phenomena, quantitative effects may largely depend upon the details of the underlying theoretical model to treat FSI. In this contribution some results of a systematic calculation of FSI and FFT effects in the inclusive and exclusive processes off few-nucleon systems will be presented.

40|$|Quantum Chromodynamics, the {{microscopic}} theory of strong interactions, {{has not yet}} been applied to the calculation of nuclear wave functions. However, it certainly provokes a number of specific questions and suggests the existence of novel phenomena in nuclear physics which {{are not part of the}} the traditional framework of the meson-nucleon description of nuclei. Many of these phenomena are related to high nuclear densities and the role of color in nucleonic interactions. Quantum fluctuations in the spatial separation between nucleons may lead to local high density configurations of cold nuclear matter in nuclei, up to four times larger than typical nuclear densities. We argue here that experiments utilizing the higher energies available upon completion of the Jefferson Laboratory energy upgrade will be able to probe the quark-gluon structure of such high density configurations and therefore elucidate the fundamental nature of nuclear matter. We review three key experimental programs: quasi-elastic <b>electro-disintegration</b> of light nuclei, deep inelastic scattering from nuclei at $x> 1 $, and the measurement of tagged structure functions. These interrelated programs are all aimed at the exploration of the quark structure of high density nuclear configurations. The study of the QCD dynamics of elementary hard processes is another important research direction and nuclei provide a unique avenue to explore these dynamics. We argue that the use of nuclear targets and large values of momentum transfer at would allow us to determine whether the physics of the nucleon form factors is dominated by spatially small configurations of three quarks.
