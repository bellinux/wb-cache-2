5|$|On the house's {{east side}} are three rooms, whose {{original}} presence {{is open to}} debate. The three rooms are interconnected, another common French colonial element. The room adjacent the porch {{was used as the}} Glidden's dining room and is where the large brick fireplace, which replaced the marble one in 1909, is located. The 1909 fireplace is of the American Craftsman style. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> near the kitchen, there is a full bathroom.|$|E
25|$|In the Banquet Hall, guests dine {{with the}} President and are entertained. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> is a trompe-l'œil painted with a {{backdrop}} of orchids. The room, formerly part {{of the kitchen and}} some workshops, is also used to display state gifts.|$|E
25|$|All guests {{enter the}} same hallway, seeking the Fountain of Youth. This single hallway {{contains}} effects {{from all three}} variations seen in “Forbidden Eye”: fiber optic stars, statues holding glowing treasure, and water effects. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> awaits the Crystal Skull. It glows demonically, signaling that the journey {{is about to take}} a turn toward the Gates of Doom.|$|E

50|$|Paired timber {{doors with}} a breezeway {{open to a}} small <b>hall.</b> <b>The</b> timber within the doors' {{framework}} has been angled to create an decorative effect. <b>The</b> <b>Hall's</b> street numbers 208 and 210, are located on small oval metal plates on the architrave. Female and male toilets are located to {{the northern and southern}} <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall.</b> <b>The</b> toilets, installed in the 1950s, have terrazzo floors and skylights.|$|R
25|$|At {{the west}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> is the living room. It is sided in {{vertical}} knotty pine paneling {{and has a}} large fireplace, {{as well as several}} chairs of Copland's and a dining area. To its north, the kitchen wing has linoleum flooring and ridged wood paneling and drywall. It houses several kitchen appliances and a small table and chair set.|$|E
25|$|On {{either side}} are {{gateways}} leading to different courts and to jury and witness rooms from which separate staircases are provided {{for them to}} reach their boxes in court. During the 1960s, jury rooms in the basement area were converted to courtrooms.

25|$|The home's {{interior}} features 16th, 17th, and 18th century French and English details. The {{building is}} heated by an oil-burning, hot air furnace and contains an Otis passenger elevator and freight elevator. The passenger elevator is wood-paneled and the freight elevator measures 5x4feet (1.5x1.2m) in diameter. The flooring consists {{of black and}} white marble squares and the walls are plastered to simulate limestone. In {{the back of the house}} is a five-bay entrance hall and staircase. The library entrance is located on the right side of the hallway and two reception rooms and a lavatory are located on the left side. Near the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> are service rooms, service elevator, dining room (now the ambassador's office), and a breakfast room. A lavatory is located beneath the main staircase. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> are two parlors and a large drawing room. The second floor contains three bedrooms, two baths, and a service area. One of the bedrooms, the master suite, contains a separate staircase that gives access to the upper floors. The third floor contains bedroom suites and a playroom in the southeast corner. The fourth floor contains additional bedrooms and servants' quarters.|$|E

50|$|At the East and West <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> {{were two}} sets of similar pulpits. Resembling the pulpits used in the Kirtland Temple, and {{repeated}} in later temples, they were arranged with four levels, the top three consisting {{of a group of}} three semi-circular stands. The lowest level was a drop-table which was raised for use in the sacrament.|$|R
25|$|The day {{begins at}} Hogwarts with {{breakfast in the}} Great Hall. Students sit at their own House table and can eat and socialise, or finish homework. The Headmaster or Headmistress eats with the professors at the High Table placed at the far <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall.</b> During breakfast, owls bring in the students' post, {{generally}} consisting of The Daily Prophet, letters from parents or friends, or packages from home. A bell signals {{the start of the}} first class of the morning at 9am.|$|E
25|$|Westminster Hall {{has served}} {{numerous}} functions. Until the 19th century, it was primarily used for judicial purposes, housing {{three of the}} most important courts in the land: the Court of King's Bench, the Court of Common Pleas and the Court of Chancery. In 1875, these courts were amalgamated into the High Court of Justice, which continued to meet in Westminster Hall until it moved to the Royal Courts of Justice in 1882. In addition to regular courts, Westminster Hall also housed important trials, including impeachment trials and the state trials of King CharlesI {{at the end of the}} English Civil War, William Wallace, Thomas More, Cardinal John Fisher, Guy Fawkes, the Earl of Strafford, the rebel Scottish lords of the 1715 and 1745 uprisings, and Warren Hastings. The St Stephen's Porch <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> displays under the stained glass window the Parliamentary War Memorial listing on eight panels the names of Members and staff of both Houses of Parliament and their sons killed serving in the First World War; the window itself, installed in 1952, commemorates members and staff of both Houses who died in the Second World War. In 2012, a new stained glass window commemorating Elizabeth II's diamond jubilee was installed opposite this window, at the other <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{layout of}} the main block {{of the house is}} four large rooms {{separated}} by a center hall. The entry hall with plank flooring painted dark is decorated with block-printed wallpaper by Joseph Dufour et Cie of Paris, depicting scenes from Telemachus' visit to the island of Calypso. At the far <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> is the elliptical cantilevered staircase, with mahogany handrail, that leads to the second level. To the left of the hall are the front and back parlors, featuring crystal chandeliers and Italian marble mantels. Leading from the front parlor is the dining room in the east wing.|$|E

25|$|Via Rail's ticket, baggage, and {{information}} counters {{are in this}} space, mostly lined against the north wall. (Via Rail ticket agents also handle all ticketing sales and baggage services for Amtrak.) Small restaurants and other stores line the opposite wall. The main clock and the main departures board are in {{the centre of the}} space. Stairwells at either <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> lead to the arrivals area one floor below and connect to urban transit. Benches are near the stairwells for passengers and those meeting them, although most prefer to wait in the departure area, down the large ramp in the centre of the south wall.|$|E
25|$|The Sanford Hall of North American birds is a one-story hall {{located on}} the third floor of the museum, above the Hall of African Peoples and between the Hall of Primates and Akeley Hall’s second level. Its 25 dioramas depict birds from across North America in their native habitats. Opening in 1909, the dioramas in Sanford Hall were the first to be {{exhibited}} in the museum and are, at present, the oldest still on display. At the far <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> are two large murals by renowned ornithologist and artist, Louis Agassiz Fuertes. In addition to the species listed below, the hall also has display cases devoted to large collections of warblers, owls, and raptors.|$|E
25|$|The Mahishasuramardini Cave Temple {{is close}} to the {{lighthouse}} {{on the top of the}} hill. It has two carved frescoes of Durga, the mother goddess at both ends of the long hall of the cave. She is shown seated on lion her mount or vehicle with all her weapons. The depiction also features her posture of slaying the buffalo headed Mahishasura. At the other <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> opposite to the Durga panel, the scene carved is of Vishnu in a reclining posture on the bed of Ananta multi-hooded serpent. He is surrounded by the divine beings of heaven appealing him to continue with the creation of the universe. There is also a third chamber which shows a carved fresco of Vishnu.|$|E

50|$|Sophia's Dairy is a {{historic}} home located at Aberdeen, Harford County, Maryland, United States. It is a large center-hall brick house, 64 by 45 ft, with a low stone wing, built in 1768 in the Georgian style. The interior features a double stair which extends upward on the west wall from both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall.</b> It continues east in one short flight, then separates and parallels the lower flight to <b>the</b> second story <b>hall.</b>|$|R
25|$|The public {{entrance}} to the abbey site {{is now on the}} south side, where the extant ruins are at their most impressive. Visitors are confronted by the elaborately decorated, five-sided bay window of the abbot's private quarters. This is of very late date – probably {{the second half of the}} 15th century. The accommodation for the abbots became steadily more luxurious and more private throughout the history of the abbey. Beyond the window are remains of the 12th-century abbot's rooms, which were on a far more modest scale. The large and impressive abbot's hall, with its great west window of six lights, was built in the 14th century, partly over some of the 12th-century abbot's buildings. Below the window doorways led to the service buildings: remains and traces of these mainly 12th-century structures are still visible beyond the western <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall.</b> This southern end of the site was considerably modified but preserved after the dissolution, when it was used as a family residence.|$|E
25|$|The {{cabinets}} of the Netherlands and Belgium {{are excellent}} models of design. These {{pieces of furniture}} were usually arranged in two storeys with a fine moulded and carved cornice, mid division and plinth. The pilasters at the sides, and small raised panels carved only on the projecting part, would compose a very harmonious whole. A proportion of the French cabinets are decorated with caryatids not carved in the best taste, and, like other French woodwork of this period, are sometimes overloaded with sculpture. The doors of St Maclou, Rouen, fine as they are, would hardly to-day be held up as models for imitation. A noteworthy set of doors belong to the Oudenaarde Town Hall. The central door contains twelve and that on either side eight panels, {{each of which is}} carved with Renaissance foliage surrounding an unobtrusive figure. In the Palais de Justice we see that great scheme of decoration which takes up the whole of the fireplace <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall.</b> Five large figures carved in the round are surrounded by small ones and with foliage and coats of arms.|$|E
25|$|Pit Hill Chapel {{opened in}} 1990, and {{represents}} the Wesleyan Methodist tradition which was growing in North East England, with the chapels used for both religious worship and as community venues, which continue in {{its role in}} the museum display. Opened in the 1850s, it originally stood not far from its present site, having been built in what would eventually become Beamish village, near the museum entrance. A stained glass window of The Light of The World by William Holman Hunt came from a chapel in Bedlington. A two handled Love Feast Mug dates from 1868, and came from a chapel in Shildon Colliery. On the eastern wall, above the elevated altar area, is an angled plain white surface used for magic lantern shows, generated using a replica of the double-lensed acetylene gas powered lanterns of the period, mounted in the aisle of the main seating area. Off the western <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> is the vestry, featuring a small library and communion sets from Trimdon Colliery and Catchgate.|$|E
50|$|This room, {{the largest}} in the Palace today, is also known as the Ballroom, used for state dinners and large assemblies, notably the mass oath takings of public {{officials}} begun by President Ramos. The upholstered benches are lined up for guests on such occasions. When the room is used for state dinners, the benches are removed and round tables set in place. Orchestras sometimes play from the minstrels' galleries at two <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt engaged {{architect}} Charles Follen McKim, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> firm McKim, Mead, and White, {{to reconfigure}} and redesign the White House. McKim’s plan removed the Grand Staircase at <b>the</b> West <b>End</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cross <b>Hall</b> to increase <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State Dining Room {{by more than}} a third. McKim relocated the new Grand Staircase in <b>the</b> eastern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cross <b>Hall,</b> opposite <b>the</b> entrance to the Green Room in <b>the</b> site <b>of</b> Hoban's less formal east staircase.|$|R

Furthermore, <b>the</b> western third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall's</b> roof, destroyed in World War II and restored thereafter will be cut by a diagonal structure placed partially inside and partially outside <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> so as to [...] "let the building's new function spread beyond its confines".|$|R
25|$|The Palace of Lausus was renowned {{throughout}} Constantinople for {{the vast}} collection of heroic and mythological statues that its owner housed within its walls. Lausus amassed this huge collection from eastern temples that were being sacked and emptied {{during the reign of}} Theodosius – and, as such, his collection was likely the most diverse to have existed in Constantinople at the time. Lausus' collection of pagan statues was the first that was dispassionately assembled on purely aesthetic and historical grounds, even though he was reportedly a devout Christian. Foremost amongst his collection was the statue of Zeus from Olympia carved by Phidias in circa 500 BC and Praxiteles' Aphrodite of Cnidus. Lausus is also known to have owned the Hera of Samos and the Athena of Lindos, as well as statues of both Eros and Kairos. Reports indicate that Lausus had arranged his collection in a certain order. The aforementioned statue of Zeus was located in an apse at the far <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> with Eros and Kairos at his side. One wall was dedicated to sculptures of goddesses, the other of animals.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, Catherine {{increased}} {{the element of}} dance in her festive entertainments, and it became the norm for a major ballet to climax each series of magnificences. The Ballet Comique de la Reine, devised under Catherine's influence, by Queen Louise for the Joyeuse Magnificences of 1581, is regarded by historians as {{the moment when the}} ballet de cour assumed the character of a new art form. The theme of the entertainment was an invocation of cosmic forces to aid the monarchy, which at that time was threatened by the rebellion not only of Huguenots but of many Catholic nobles. Men were shown as reduced to beasts by Circe, who held court in a garden at one <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall.</b> Louise and her ladies, costumed as naiads, entered on a chariot designed as a fountain and then danced a ballet of thirteen geometric figures. After being turned to stone by Circe, they were freed to dance a ballet of forty geometric figures. Four groups of dancers, each wearing a different-coloured costume, moved through a sequence of patterns, including squares, triangles, circles, and spirals.|$|E
500|$|On the {{south-west}} side of {{the court}} is the hall, a 16th-century design incorporating an earlier hall on the same site. [...] wide, the hall was originally [...] high, with a roof made of Irish oak, lit and ventilated by a cupola in the middle. A large oriel window lit the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> occupied at dinner by the earls of Worcester, which by the time Raglan was built would have been used only for larger formal occasions. Originally, the hall would have been fitted with carved wooden panelling and a minstrel's gallery.|$|E
