50|$|There {{are various}} legends about their origin. According {{to one of}} them, it is {{believed}} that they are the descendants of Greek soldiers of Alexander's army. As the legend goes, some soldiers took refuge in this remote land after Alexander left the country and later settled there permanently.

40|$|Currently, <b>genetic</b> <b>typing</b> of {{microorganisms}} {{is widely used}} in several major fields of microbiological research. Taxonomy, research aimed at elucidation of evolutionary dynamics or phylogenetic relationships, population genetics {{of microorganisms}}, and microbial epidemiology all rely on <b>genetic</b> <b>typing</b> data for discrimination between genotypes. Apart from being {{an essential component of}} these fundamental sciences, microbial typing clearly affects several areas of applied microbiogical research. The epidemiological investigation of outbreaks of infectious diseases and the measurement of genetic diversity in relation to relevant biological properties such as pathogenicity, drug resistance, and biodegradation capacities are obvious examples. The diversity among nucleic acid molecules provides the basic information for all fields described above. However, researchers in various disciplines tend to use different vocabularies, a wide variety of different experimental methods to monitor genetic variation, and sometimes widely differing modes of data processing and interpretation.

Specimens were collected at 25 locations from the High Arctic to Iberia, {{and a total of}} 1013 individual specimens were successfully SEM imaged and genotyped. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out in combination with 28 other elphidiid sequences from GenBank and seventeen distinct elphidiid <b>genetic</b> <b>types</b> were identified within the sample set, seven being sequenced for the first time. <b>Genetic</b> <b>types</b> cluster into seven main clades which largely represent their general morphological character. Differences between <b>genetic</b> <b>types</b> at the <b>genetic,</b> morphological and biogeographic levels are indicative of species level distinction. Their biogeographic distributions, in combination with elphidiid SSU sequences from GenBank and high resolution images from the literature show that each of them exhibits species-specific rather than clade-specific biogeographies. Due to taxonomic uncertainty and divergent taxonomic concepts between schools, we believe that morphospecies names should not be placed onto molecular phylogenies unless both the morphology and <b>genetic</b> <b>type</b> have been linked to the formally named holotype, or equivalent. Based on strict morphological criteria, we advocate using only a three-stage approach to taxonomy for practical application in micropalaeontological studies.
