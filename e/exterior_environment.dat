5|$|The trailer was {{produced}} and {{made by the}} Glasgow-based Axis Animation, which had previously created trailers for Killzone 2 and Mass Effect 2. According to Stuart Aitken, Axis's Managing Director and Technical Director {{and the director of}} the trailer, Deep Silver gave the team a lot of creative freedom and flexibility in creating the trailer, allowing them to create their own characters instead of using the in-game protagonists. Deep Silver had given them a script and general ideas for them to follow, and the team expanded upon it. In order to make the trailer feel non-linear and focused, the team decided to narrow down the trailer's location to only a single hotel room. Deep Silver wanted the trailer to have some <b>exterior</b> <b>environment.</b> As a result, the team added a segment which has the daughter falling from the hotel window; in the process, audiences glimpse the island setting.|$|E
25|$|Neonatal sidewinders {{engage in}} a {{remarkable}} behavioral homeothermy {{that has not been}} observed in any other type of snake. Following birth, the neonates mass together in their natal burrow. Most often, gravid females select an east-facing, small-diameter rodent burrow for giving birth. For the first week or so of their lives, neonatal sidewinders literally plug the entrance to this burrow during daylight hours, forming a dynamic multiple-individual mass that takes advantage of the hot <b>exterior</b> <b>environment</b> and the cool interior of the burrow to maintain an average aggregate temperature of 32°C (the optimal temperature for shedding). The dynamic mass of neonates modifies the thermal environment at the burrow entrance such that the young can occupy a location that would ordinarily become lethally hot for an individual neonate (or even an adult). Because of the constant movements of the neonates, the aggregate assumes stable temperature properties reminiscent of a homeothermic organism (i.e., maintains tight temperature tolerance ± 2°C).|$|E

50|$|A {{significant}} {{development in}} the glulam industry was the introduction of fully water-resistant phenol-resorcinol adhesive in 1942. This allowed glulam {{to be used in}} exposed <b>exterior</b> <b>environments</b> without concern of gluline degradation. The first U.S. manufacturing standard for glulam was Commercial Standard CS253-63, which was published by the Department of Commerce in 1963. The most recent standard is ANSI/AITC Standard A190.1-02, which took effect in 2002. The roof of the Centre Pompidou-Metz museum is composed of sixteen kilometers of glued laminated timber. It represents a 90-metre wide hexagon with a surface area of 8,000 m². The glued laminated timber motif forms hexagonal wooden units resembling the cane-work pattern of a Chinese hat.|$|R

50|$|Development of {{the game}} began in November 1992. A {{development}} team of 13 people - considered large at that time - worked on the game. Spielberg was also involved in the game during its development {{to ensure that it}} would be faithful to his initial vision. Materials related to the film, including its script and photographs of the sets, aided the developers during the game's production. Jurassic Park was released in the United Kingdom in October 1993, and was subsequently released in the United States a year later. Many critics praised the game's indoor environments, but some criticized its large <b>exterior</b> <b>environment,</b> and its boring and repetitive gameplay.|$|E

50|$|A similar {{presentation}} style {{had been used}} in previous Atelier Bow Wow publications, such as “Pet Architecture” and “Made in Tokyo”, but in “Graphic Anatomy” their skills have been used to induce a new sense of spatial depth in house illustration, whilst simultaneously attempting to catalogue 24 previous house designs by Atelier Bow-Wow. The use of vertical and horizontal perspectives, together with magnified construction details allows for a new way of observing architecture not only as an object, but within that single frame consisting of many spatial compositions, between rooms and components, between interiors and their adjacent <b>exterior</b> <b>environments,</b> between actions and locations, and ultimately between humans and the spaces they inhabit.|$|R
40|$|Protection and {{preservation}} of wood properties in <b>exterior</b> <b>environments</b> can only be ensured if the surface is coated with a paint or varnish. In our experiments a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) {{was used as a}} wood surface pretreatment for improvement of the subsequent deposition of thin paint layers from solutions onto these surfaces. As the adsorption, interfacial interactions and adhesion of paints are strongly dependent on surface wettability, the dynamics of the wetting process was analyzed. The results show that the water contact angle decreases after the DBD treatment, proving a more wettable surface. Additionally, the spreading of paint solution on the DBD treated surface is more isotropic, showing a lower tendency to elongate along the wood fiber orientation...|$|R

5000|$|Reconnecting the {{individual}} with nature {{is one of}} the great challenges of an urbanized society. The 60 acre rural site offered Mies an opportunity to bring man's relationship to nature into the forefront. Here he highlights {{the individual}}'s connection to nature through the medium of a man-made shelter. Mies said: [...] "We should attempt to bring nature, houses, and the human being to a higher unity". Glass walls and open interior space are the features that create an intense connection with the outdoor environment, while providing a framework reduces opaque exterior walls to a minimum.
