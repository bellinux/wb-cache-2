500|$|In October 2007, MTV {{reported}} that Hot Chip {{was planning to}} give [...] "Ready for the Floor" [...] to Kylie Minogue. Other reports incorrectly suggested that Hot Chip had written Made in the Darks second single, [...] "Ready for the Floor" [...] specifically for Minogue. Taylor explained {{that it was a}} misunderstanding; [...] "It started because someone asked me if we would ever write for Kylie. I said that we'd been asked to write for her but we'd never got round to it. And I said <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> give her one of our songs, [...] "Ready for the Floor" [...] would probably be the most suitable. From that, I got misquoted. We didn't write [...] "Ready for the Floor" [...] for Kylie, didn't send it to her and she never heard it." ...|$|E
500|$|Berryman {{discontinued}} {{his university}} studies {{to prepare for}} the entrance examination for Staff College, Camberley. Eighteen Australian Army officers sat the exam that year, but only Berryman and one other officer passed. Only two Australian officers were accepted into staff college each year, so Berryman's [...] attendance from 1926 to 1928 marked him out as one of the Australian Army's rising talents. It also allowed him to forge useful contacts with the British Army. Berryman later recalled, [...] "The advantage of this was that in war we had the same doctrine of tactics and administration, which was essential <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> work together. More than that, the officers who had to carry out their duties in cooperation knew each other personally." [...] After graduation he was posted to the High Commission of Australia, London, from 1929 to 1932, where he served under the Military Liaison Officer, Major General Julius Bruche.|$|E
500|$|On {{including}} the Punisher {{specifically in the}} season, where he is introduced to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Goddard felt television was the best fit for the character, as the writers are [...] "able to do things {{on the small screen}} that fit that character better than <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> water him down for the movies." [...] Goddard stated that the season's approach to the characters and their actions would be to do what makes sense for the characters rather than [...] "pushing the boundary" [...] or looking to shock the audience, though he noted that this could still go in a more [...] "adult...darker, dirtier" [...] way due to the freedom of Netflix and the presence of characters such as the Punisher. Petrie stated that the writers hoped to [...] "stir the pot" [...] and [...] "get people to think" [...] with the inclusion of the Punisher and his lethal methods, adding, [...] "Taking lethal justice into your own hands in America in 2015 is tricky shit. We have not shied away from the rich complicated reality of Now. If you've got a gun and you're not the police you're going to incite strong feelings." [...] Ramirez added that Castle was not referred to as [...] "Punisher" [...] in the writer's room, similarly to Wilson Fisk not being called [...] "Kingpin" [...] for season one, as it allowed the writers to think [...] "about [...] as a man with a vendetta, who made an oath to his dead family. The more specific it got, the less it became about issues outside of Hell’s Kitchen or other things." [...] In the series, the moniker of [...] "The Punisher" [...] is given to Castle by the media due to his aggressive actions.|$|E

2500|$|Clarke advised Madeleine Albright {{during the}} Genocide in Rwanda, to request the UN to {{withdraw}} all UN troops from Rwanda. She refused, but permitted General Dallaire {{to keep a}} few hundred troops who managed to save thousands from the genocide. Later Clarke told Samantha Power, “It wasn’t in American’s national interest. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{do the same thing}} today and I was advising the President, I would advise the same thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{prosecutors}} had also drafted an affidavit {{for the trial}} judge in response to Foster's motion for a new trial. It contained the statement: [...] "If {{it comes down to}} having to pick one of the black jurors, [...] might be okay. This is solely my opinion .... Upon picking of the jury after listening to all of the jurors we had to pick, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pick a black juror I recommend that [...] be one of the jurors." [...] The statement was crossed-out by hand and was omitted in the affidavit filed with the court.|$|E

6000|$|... " [...] Indeed, I won't, Ned. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> can't {{get home}} together, I'll stay {{and go with}} you, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> walk {{every step of the}} way." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "We {{should have}} brought Ki with us, even <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> carry him bound, that he might {{interpret}} this marvel, for it is sure {{that no one else}} can." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{examined}} the walls, which were pretty jagged and rough in some places, {{and we both}} agreed that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do it, we believed we could climb to the top.|$|E
6000|$|... "Humph! If you {{are going}} to talk that way, what will you say <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> stay here weeks, or months, or maybe years?" [...] asked Phil.|$|R

6000|$|... "This is {{all very}} well, when one has his stuff with him," [...] {{observed}} Fred. [...] "But <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> go out and shoot game or catch fish, {{it would be a}} different story." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush, my dear boy, you frighten me; {{you know}} it is all explained. Fancy, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> deal with a nation of Thugs, and no means of {{guarding}} them—-a different dispensation and all. But here come the children, so hush." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "None whatever. There {{would surely}} be a row, in that case, and <b>we</b> intend <b>to</b> <b>have</b> everything; pass off pleasantly <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> kill a few to keep the peace." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I can't {{believe they}} would be mad enough to do that, Doctor; they have {{everything}} to lose by it, and nothing to gain, that is, individually; {{and we should be}} sure to win in the long run, even <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> conquer back India foot by foot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That may be,' {{said her}} husband. 'Methinks she {{would soon be}} a dear cow <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> feed her on salt herring.

6000|$|... "It {{would not}} do to leave them here," [...] Jack said. [...] "If they managed to untie each other they would give the alarm, and <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> come back we should be caught.
