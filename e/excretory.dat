5|$|In the chaetonotidans, the <b>excretory</b> system {{consists}} of {{a single pair of}} protonephridia, which open through separate pores on the lateral underside of the animal, usually in the midsection of the body. In the macrodasyidans, there are several pairs of these opening {{along the side of the}} body. Nitrogenous waste is probably excreted through the body wall, as part of respiration, and the protonephridia are believed to function mainly in osmoregulation. Unusually, the protonephridia do not take the form of flame cells, but, instead, the <b>excretory</b> cells consist of a skirt surrounding a series of cytoplasmic rods that in turn enclose a central flagellum. These cells, termed cyrtocytes, connect to a single outlet cell which passes the excreted material into the protonephridial duct.|$|E
5|$|The atria of {{the heart}} also {{function}} {{as part of the}} <b>excretory</b> system by filtering waste products out of the blood and dumping it into the coelom as urine. A pair of nephridia ("little kidneys") to the rear of and connected to the coelom extracts any re-usable materials from the urine and dumps additional waste products into it, and then ejects it via tubes that discharge into the mantle cavity.|$|E
5|$|As in all arthropods, the chelicerate {{body has}} a very small coelom {{restricted}} to small areas round the reproductive and <b>excretory</b> systems. The main body cavity is a hemocoel that runs most {{of the length of}} the body and through which blood flows, driven by a tubular heart that collects blood from the rear and pumps it forward. Although arteries direct the blood to specific parts of the body, they have open ends rather than joining directly to veins, and chelicerates therefore have open circulatory systems as is typical for arthropods.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} molluscs, the <b>excretory</b> organs of {{bivalves}} are {{a pair of}} nephridia. Each of these consists of a long, looped, glandular tube, which opens into the body cavity just beneath the heart, and a bladder to store urine. The pericardial glands either line the auricles of the heart or attach to the pericardium, and serve as extra filtration organs. Metabolic waste is voided from the bladders through a pair of openings {{near the front of}} {{the upper part of the}} mantle cavity, from where it joins the stream of exhalant water.|$|E
5|$|Millipedes breathe {{through two}} pairs of spiracles located ventrally on each segment near {{the base of the}} legs. Each opens into an {{internal}} pouch, and connects to a system of tracheae. The heart runs {{the entire length of the}} body, with an aorta stretching into the head. The <b>excretory</b> organs are {{two pairs of}} malpighian tubules, located near the mid-part of the gut. The digestive tract is a simple tube with two pairs of salivary glands to help digest the food.|$|E
5|$|The main {{nitrogenous}} {{waste product}} is ammonia. Starfish have no distinct <b>excretory</b> organs; waste ammonia is removed by diffusion through the tube feet and papulae. The body fluid contains phagocytic cells, coelomocytes, {{which are also}} found within the hemal and water vascular systems. These cells engulf waste material, and eventually migrate to {{the tips of the}} papulae, where a portion of body wall is nipped off and ejected into the surrounding water. Some waste may also be excreted by the pyloric glands and voided with the faeces.|$|E
5|$|Although {{adapted to}} {{terrestrial}} life, frogs resemble freshwater fish in {{their inability to}} conserve body water effectively. When they are on land, much water is lost by evaporation from the skin. The <b>excretory</b> system {{is similar to that}} of mammals and there are two kidneys that remove nitrogenous products from the blood. Frogs produce large quantities of dilute urine in order to flush out toxic products from the kidney tubules. The nitrogen is excreted as ammonia by tadpoles and aquatic frogs but mainly as urea, a less toxic product, by most terrestrial adults. A few species of tree frog with little access to water excrete the even less toxic uric acid. The urine passes along paired ureters to the urinary bladder from which it is vented periodically into the cloaca. All bodily wastes exit the body through the cloaca which terminates in a cloacal vent.|$|E
5|$|Insects have {{segmented}} bodies {{supported by}} exoskeletons, the hard outer covering made mostly of chitin. The {{segments of the}} body are organized into three distinctive but interconnected units, or tagmata: a head, a thorax and an abdomen. The head supports a pair of sensory antennae, a pair of compound eyes, and, if present, one to three simple eyes (or ocelli) and three sets of variously modified appendages that form the mouthparts. The thorax has six segmented legs—one pair each for the prothorax, mesothorax and the metathorax segments making up the thorax—and, none, two or four wings. The abdomen consists of eleven segments, though in a few species of insects, these segments may be fused together or reduced in size. The abdomen also contains most of the digestive, respiratory, <b>excretory</b> and reproductive internal structures. Considerable variation and many adaptations in the body parts of insects occur, especially wings, legs, antenna and mouthparts.|$|E
5|$|Insects possess {{segmented}} bodies {{supported by}} a hard-jointed outer covering, the exoskeleton, made mostly of chitin. The segments of the body are organized into three distinct parts, a head, a thorax and an abdomen. The head typically bears a pair of sensory antennae, a pair of compound eyes, one to three simple eyes (ocelli) and three sets of modified appendages that form the mouthparts. The thorax has three pairs of segmented legs, one pair each for the three segments that compose the thorax {{and one or two}} pairs of wings. The abdomen is composed of eleven segments, some of which may be fused and houses the digestive, respiratory, <b>excretory</b> and reproductive systems. There is considerable variation between species and many adaptations to the body parts, especially wings, legs, antennae and mouthparts.|$|E
5|$|Like other arthropods, spiders are coelomates {{in which}} the coelom is reduced to small areas round the {{reproductive}} and <b>excretory</b> systems. Its place is largely taken by a hemocoel, a cavity that runs most {{of the length of}} the body and through which blood flows. The heart is a tube in {{the upper part of the}} body, with a few ostia that act as non-return valves allowing blood to enter the heart from the hemocoel but prevent it from leaving before it reaches the front end. However, in spiders, it occupies only the upper part of the abdomen, and blood is discharged into the hemocoel by one artery that opens at the rear end of the abdomen and by branching arteries that pass through the pedicle and open into several parts of the cephalothorax. Hence spiders have open circulatory systems. The blood of many spiders that have book lungs contains the respiratory pigment hemocyanin to make oxygen transport more efficient.|$|E
5|$|The kidneys and <b>excretory</b> {{system are}} {{much the same}} as in other reptiles, but {{crocodilians}} do not have a bladder. In fresh water, the osmolality (the concentration of solutes that contribute to a solution's osmotic pressure) in the plasma is much higher {{than it is in the}} surrounding water. The animals are well-hydrated, and the urine in the cloaca is abundant and dilute, nitrogen being excreted as ammonium bicarbonate. Sodium loss is low and mainly takes place through the skin in freshwater conditions. In seawater, the opposite is true. The osmolality in the plasma is lower than the surrounding water, which is dehydrating for the animal. The cloacal urine is much more concentrated, white, and opaque, with the nitrogenous waste being mostly excreted as insoluble uric acid.|$|E
5|$|The {{scales on}} {{butterfly}} wings are pigmented with melanins {{that can produce}} the colours black and brown. The white colour in the butterfly family Pieridae is a derivative of uric acid, an <b>excretory</b> product. Bright blues, greens, reds and iridescence are usually created not by pigments but through the microstructure of the scales. This structural coloration {{is the result of}} coherent scattering of light by the photonic crystal nature of the scales. The specialised scales that provide structural colours to reflected light mostly produce ultra-violet patterns which are discernible {{in that part of the}} ultra-violet spectrum that lepidopteran eyes can see. The structural colour seen is often dependent upon the angle of view. For example, in Morpho cypris, the colour from the front is a bright blue but when seen from an angle changes very quickly to black.|$|E
5|$|Rhabdomyolysis {{may cause}} kidney failure by several mechanisms. The most {{important}} is the accumulation of myoglobin in the kidney tubules. Normally, the blood protein haptoglobin binds circulating myoglobin and other heme-containing substances, but in rhabdomyolysis the quantity of myoglobin exceeds the binding capacity of haptoglobin. Myoglobinuria, the presence of myoglobin in the urine, occurs when the level in plasma exceeds 0.5–1.5mg/dl; once plasma levels reach 100mg/dl, the concentration in the urine becomes sufficient {{for it to be}} visibly discolored and corresponds with the destruction of about 200grams of muscle. As the kidneys reabsorb more water from the , myoglobin interacts with Tamm–Horsfall protein in the nephron to form casts (solid aggregates) that obstruct the normal flow of fluid; the condition is worsened further by high levels of uric acid and acidification of the filtrate, which increase cast formation. Iron released from the heme generates reactive oxygen species, damaging the kidney cells. In addition to the myoglobinuria, two other mechanisms contribute to kidney impairment: low blood pressure leads to constriction of the blood vessels and therefore a relative lack of blood flow to the kidney, and finally uric acid may form crystals in the tubules of the kidneys, causing obstruction. Together, these processes lead to acute tubular necrosis, the destruction of the cells of tubules. Glomerular filtration rate falls and the kidney is unable to perform its normal <b>excretory</b> functions. This causes disruption of electrolyte regulation, leading to a further rise in potassium levels, and interferes with vitamin D processing, further worsening the low calcium levels.|$|E
25|$|The <b>excretory</b> glands of arachnids include {{up to four}} {{pairs of}} coxal glands {{along the side of}} the prosoma, and one or two pairs of Malpighian tubules, {{emptying}} into the gut. Many arachnids have only one or the other type of <b>excretory</b> gland, although several do have both. The primary nitrogenous waste product in arachnids is guanine.|$|E
25|$|Echinostoma have a {{digestive}} system {{consisting of a}} pharynx, oesophagus and an <b>excretory</b> pore.|$|E
25|$|Microlepidoptera (types {{of smaller}} moths) larva have been {{observed}} to feed on the <b>excretory</b> waste of wasp larva.|$|E
25|$|Hedylopsacean Acochlidiacea, whose {{evolution}} involves several habitat {{shifts from}} marine interstitial to amphibious or freshwater benthic habitats, possess complex <b>excretory</b> and reproductive systems.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Society of England {{publishes the}} studies of the Italian anatomist Marcaello Malpighi the {{discoverer}} of the insect <b>excretory</b> organs known as Malpighian tubules.|$|E
25|$|Cats {{living in}} groups can infect {{each other with}} {{different}} strains of the virus during visits to a communal litter tray. Some cats are resistant to the virus and can avoid infection or even becoming carriers, while others may become FECV carriers. Carriers may heal spontaneously, but acquired immunity may be short, and they may go on to reinfect, usually within a few weeks, if they {{are living in a}} group with healthy, but persistent, <b>excretory</b> carriers. Some cats never heal, and the <b>excretory</b> phase remains permanently.|$|E
25|$|The {{nervous system}} {{is similar to}} that of other arthropods, {{including}} a ventral nerve cord with ganglia in each segment. Although the body contains a haemocoel, there are no circulatory, respiratory, or <b>excretory</b> organs.|$|E
25|$|Further {{adaptations to}} {{terrestrial}} life are appendages modified for more efficient locomotion on land, internal fertilisation, special sensory organs, {{and water conservation}} enhanced by efficient <b>excretory</b> structures {{as well as a}} waxy layer covering the cuticle.|$|E
25|$|The <b>excretory</b> duct of each seminal gland unites {{with the}} {{corresponding}} vas deferens {{to form the}} two ejaculatory ducts, which immediately pass through {{the substance of the}} prostate gland before opening separately into the verumontanum of the prostatic urethra.|$|E
25|$|Some marine oligochaeta (e.g., Olavius or Inanidrillus) have obligate {{extracellular}} endosymbionts {{that fill}} {{the entire body}} of their host. These marine worms are nutritionally dependent on their symbiotic chemoautotrophic bacteria lacking any digestive or <b>excretory</b> system (no gut, mouth, or nephridia).|$|E
25|$|Because {{of their}} small size, copepods {{have no need}} of any heart or circulatory system (the members of the order Calanoida have a heart, but no blood vessels), and most also lack gills. Instead, they absorb oxygen {{directly}} into their bodies. Their <b>excretory</b> system consists of maxillary glands.|$|E
25|$|In many marine nematodes, {{one or two}} {{unicellular}} 'renette glands' excrete salt {{through a}} pore {{on the underside of}} the animal, close to the pharynx. In most other nematodes, these specialised cells have been replaced by an organ consisting of two parallel ducts connected by a single transverse duct. This transverse duct opens into a common canal that runs to the <b>excretory</b> pore.|$|E
25|$|There are 800-1000 minor {{salivary glands}} located {{throughout}} the oral cavity within the submucosa {{of the oral}} mucosa in the tissue of the buccal, labial, and lingual mucosa, the soft palate, the lateral parts of the hard palate, and {{the floor of the}} mouth or between muscle fibers of the tongue. They are 1-2mm in diameter and unlike the major glands, they are not encapsulated by connective tissue, only surrounded by it. The gland has usually a number of acini connected in a tiny lobule. A minor salivary gland may have a common <b>excretory</b> duct with another gland, or may have its own <b>excretory</b> duct. Their secretion is mainly mucous in nature (except for Von Ebner glands- see next section) and have many functions such as coating the oral cavity with saliva. Problems with dentures are sometimes associated with minor salivary glands if there is dry mouth present (see further discussion). The minor salivary glands are innervated by the seventh cranial or facial nerve.|$|E
25|$|Barnacles have no true heart, {{although}} a sinus {{close to the}} esophagus performs similar function, with blood being pumped through it {{by a series of}} muscles. The blood vascular system is minimal. Similarly, they have no gills, absorbing oxygen from the water through their limbs and the inner membrane of their carapaces. The <b>excretory</b> organs of barnacles are maxillary glands.|$|E
25|$|Venipuncture {{is useful}} {{as it is}} a {{minimally}} invasive way to obtain cells and extracellular fluid (plasma) from the body for analysis. Blood flows throughout the body, acting as a medium which provides oxygen and nutrients to tissues and carries waste products back to the <b>excretory</b> systems for disposal. Consequently, the state of the bloodstream affects, or is affected by, many medical conditions. For these reasons, blood tests are the most commonly performed medical tests.|$|E
25|$|The main imaging tests {{performed}} {{in order to}} identify renal cell carcinoma are pelvic and abdominal CT scans, ultrasound tests of the kidneys (ultrasonography), MRI scans, intravenous pyelogram (IVP) or renal angiography. Among these main diagnostic tests, other radiologic tests such as <b>excretory</b> urography, positron-emission tomography (PET) scanning, ultrasonography, arteriography, venography, and bone scanning {{can also be used to}} aid in the evaluation of staging renal masses and to differentiate non-malignant tumours from malignant tumours.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone may rarely {{cause more}} severe side effects such as anaphylaxis, renal failure, {{hepatitis}} (two reported cases, neither serious), agranulocytosis, DRESS syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis. Five cases {{of breast cancer}} in patients who took spironolactone for prolonged periods of time have been reported. It should also be used with caution in people with some neurological disorders, anuria, acute kidney injury, or significant impairment of renal <b>excretory</b> function with risk of hyperkalemia.|$|E
25|$|Intensive marine {{aquaculture}} {{in the last}} decade has increased considerably and resulted in considerable adverse environmental impacts. Large discharge volumes of organic matter from uneaten feed and <b>excretory</b> waste from aquacultured species has resulted in high levels of nutrients within coastal waters. Large quantities of nitrogen (~ 75%) excreted from bivalves, salmon and shrimp, enter into the coastal environment, with the potential to develop algal blooms, and reduce dissolved oxygen in the water.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the body}} are {{openings}} to the mantle cavity, which contains the gills (ctenidia) and openings to the <b>excretory</b> and reproductive systems. At {{the front of}} the mantle cavity lies the siphon, which the squid uses for locomotion via precise jet propulsion. In this form of locomotion, water is sucked into the mantle cavity and expelled out of the siphon in a fast, strong jet. The direction of the siphon can be changed, to suit the direction of travel.|$|E
25|$|In {{almost every}} segment {{is a pair}} of <b>excretory</b> organs called nephridia, which are derived from coelom tissue. Each {{consists}} of a small pouch that is connected, via a flagellated conductor called a nephridioduct, to an opening {{at the base of the}} nearest leg known as a nephridiopore. The pouch is occupied by special cells called podocytes, which facilitate ultrafiltration of the blood through the partition between haemocoelom and nephridium. The composition of the urinary solution is modified in the nephridioduct by selective recovery of nutrients and water and by isolation of poison and waste materials, before it is excreted to the outside world via the nephridiopore. The most important nitrogenous excretion product is the water-insoluble uric acid; this can be excreted in solid state, with very little water. This so-called uricotelic <b>excretory</b> mode represents an adjustment to life on land and the associated necessity of dealing economically with water. A pair of former nephridia in the head were converted secondarily into the salivary glands, while another pair in the final segment of male specimens now serve as glands that apparently play a role in reproduction.|$|E
25|$|All {{vertebrates}} share {{similarities in}} body structure; {{they all have}} a skeleton, a nervous system, a circulatory system, a digestive system and <b>excretory</b> system. Similar to humans, non-human animals also have a sensory system. The sensory system {{is responsible for the}} basic five senses from touch to tasting. Most of the physiological and biochemical responses found in animals are found in humans. Neurophysiologists have not found any fundamental difference between the structure and function of neurons and synapse between humans and other animals.|$|E
25|$|The sublingual glands are a pair {{of major}} salivary glands located {{inferior}} to the tongue, anterior to the submandibular glands. The secretion produced is mainly mucous in nature; however, it is categorized as a mixed gland. Unlike the other two major glands, the ductal system of the sublingual glands does not have intercalated ducts and usually does not have striated ducts either, so saliva exits directly from 8-20 <b>excretory</b> ducts known as the Rivinus ducts. Approximately 5% of saliva entering the oral cavity comes from these glands.|$|E
25|$|Squid {{have three}} hearts. Two branchial hearts feed the gills, each {{surrounding}} the larger systemic heart that pumps blood around the body. Squid blood contains the copper-rich protein hemocyanin for transporting oxygen. The faintly greenish hearts {{are surrounded by}} the renal sacs – the main <b>excretory</b> system. The kidneys are difficult to identify and stretch from the hearts (located at the posterior side of the ink sac) to the liver. The systemic heart is made of three chambers, a lower ventricle and two upper auricles.|$|E
