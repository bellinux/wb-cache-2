500|$|The band {{arrived at}} Pachyderm Studio without their {{equipment}} and {{spent much of}} the first three days waiting for it to arrive by mail. [...] However, once recording began on February 13, work moved quickly. [...] On most days the group began work around midday, took breaks <b>for</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>and</b> <b>dinner,</b> and continued work through midnight. [...] Cobain, Novoselic, and Grohl recorded their basic instrumental tracks together as a band. [...] The group utilized this set-up on all songs except for faster compositions like [...] "Very Ape" [...] and [...] "tourette's", where the drums were recorded separately in a nearby kitchen due to its natural reverb. [...] Albini surrounded Grohl's drum kit with about 30 microphones. [...] Cobain added additional guitar tracks to about half of the songs, then added guitar solos, and finally vocals. [...] The band did not discard takes and kept virtually everything it captured on tape. [...] Albini felt he was more an engineer than a producer; despite his personal opinions, he ultimately let the band judge which were decent takes. [...] He said, [...] "Generally speaking, [...] knows what he thinks is acceptable and what isn't acceptable [...] He can make concrete steps to improve things that he doesn't think are acceptable." [...] Cobain reportedly recorded all his vocal tracks in six hours. [...] The band completed recording in six days; Cobain had originally anticipated disagreements with Albini, who the singer heard [...] "was supposedly this sexist jerk", but called the process [...] "the easiest recording we've ever done, hands down". [...] The only disruption occurred a week into the sessions, when Courtney Love arrived because she missed Cobain. [...] The band, Love, and Albini refused to go into specifics, but Weston's girlfriend (who served as the studio's chef) stated that Love created tension by criticizing Cobain's work and being confrontational with everyone present.|$|E

[...] Regularly scheduled mealtimes <b>for</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>and</b> <b>dinner</b> are part of Wolfe's daily routine.

Lunch and dinner are served in the dining room, {{on the opposite side of}} the first-floor hallway from the front room and the office. However, Archie will eat separately in the kitchen if he is in a rush due to pressing business or a social engagement, because Wolfe cannot bear to see a meal rushed. Wolfe also has a rule against discussing business at the table, sometimes bent but very rarely overtly broken.|$|E

He told me he'd had one of the leadin' Boston architects to plan the thing out for him, and I tell you he's got something nice. 'Tain't so big as old Lion's Head, and Jeff wants to cater to a different style of custom, anyway. The buildin's longer'n what she is deep, and she spreads in front so's to give as many rooms a view of the mountain as she can. Know what 'runnaysonce' is? Well, that's the style Jeff said it was; it's all pillars and pilasters; and you ride up to the office through a double row of colyums, under a kind of a portico. It's all painted like them old Colonial houses down on Brattle Street, buff and white. Well, it made me think of one of them old pagan temples. He's got her shoved along to the south'ard, and he's widened out a piece of level for her to stand on, so 't that piece o' wood up the hill there is just behind her, and I tell you she looks nice, backin' up ag'inst the trees. I tell you, Jeff's got a head on him! I wish you could see that dinin'-room o' his: all white colyums, and frontin' on the view. Why, that devil's got a regular little theatyre back o' the dinin'-room for the young folks to act ammyture plays in, and the shows that come along, and he's got a dance-hall besides; the parlors ain't much--folks like to set in the office; and a good many of the rooms are done off into soots, and got their own parlors. I tell you, it's swell, as they say. You can order what you please for breakfast, but <b>for</b> <b>lunch</b> <b>and</b> <b>dinner</b> you got to take what Jeff gives you; but he treats you well. He's a Durgin, when it comes to that. Served in cou'ses, and dinner at seven o'clock. I don't know where he got his money for 't all, but I guess he put in his insurance fust, and then he put a mortgage on the buildin'; be as much as owned it; said he'd had a splendid season last year, and if he done as well for a copule of seasons more he'd have the whole prop'ty free o' debt." ...|$|E
