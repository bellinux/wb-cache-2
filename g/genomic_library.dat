50|$|A <b>genomic</b> <b>library</b> {{is a set}} of clones that {{together}} represents the entire genome of a given organism. The number of clones that constitute a <b>genomic</b> <b>library</b> depends on (1) the size of the genome in question and (2) the insert size tolerated by the particular cloning vector system. For most practical purposes, the tissue source of the genomic DNA is unimportant because each cell of the body contains virtually identical DNA (with some exceptions).|$|E

50|$|A <b>genomic</b> <b>library</b> is a {{collection}} of the total genomic DNA from a single organism. The DNA is stored in a population of identical vectors, each containing a different insert of DNA. In order to construct a <b>genomic</b> <b>library,</b> the organism's DNA is extracted from cells and then digested with a restriction enzyme to cut the DNA into fragments of a specific size. The fragments are then inserted into the vector using DNA ligase. Next, the vector DNA can be taken up by a host organism - commonly a population of Escherichia coli or yeast - with each cell containing only one vector molecule. Using a host cell to carry the vector allows for easy amplification and retrieval of specific clones from the library for analysis.|$|E

50|$|One major use of genomic {{libraries}} is hierarchichal shotgun sequencing, {{which is}} also called top-down, map-based or clone-by-clone sequencing. This strategy {{was developed in the}} 1980s for sequencing whole genomes before high throughput techniques for sequencing were available. Individual clones from genomic libraries can be sheared into smaller fragments, usually 500bp to 1000bp, which are more manageable for sequencing. Once a clone from a <b>genomic</b> <b>library</b> is sequenced, the sequence can be used to screen the library for other clones containing inserts which overlap with the sequenced clone. Any new overlapping clones can then be sequenced forming a contig. This technique, called chromosome walking, can be exploited to sequence entire chromosomes.|$|E
50|$|Whole genome shotgun {{sequencing}} is another method of genome sequencing {{that does not}} require a library of high-capacity vectors. Rather, it uses computer algorithms to assemble short sequence reads to cover the entire genome. Genomic libraries are often used in combination with whole genome {{shotgun sequencing}} for this reason. A high resolution map can be created by sequencing both ends of inserts from several clones in a <b>genomic</b> <b>library.</b> This map provides sequences of known distances apart, which can be used to help with the assembly of sequence reads acquired through shotgun sequencing. The human genome sequence, which was declared complete in 2003, was assembled using both a BAC library and shotgun sequencing.|$|E

Round cuts from the little skate's wings are marketed as [...] "scallops", though due to their small size their commercial importance is limited. Little skates are also often used to bait traps, especially for lobsters and eels. Skates are typically caught as bycatch in otter trawls; the little skate is not currently considered to be overfished. Along with the spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias), the little skate is often used as a model organism in biomedical research. A BAC <b>genomic</b> <b>library</b> for the little skate was completed in January 2005.|$|E
50|$|Construction of a <b>genomic</b> <b>library</b> {{involves}} creating many recombinant DNA molecules. An organism's genomic DNA {{is extracted}} and then digested with a restriction enzyme. For organisms with very small genomes (~10 kb), the digested fragments can be separated by gel electrophoresis. The separated fragments {{can then be}} excised and cloned into the vector separately. However, when a large genome is digested with a restriction enzyme, there are far too many fragments to excise individually. The entire set of fragments must be cloned together with the vector, and separation of clones can occur after. In either case, the fragments are ligated into a vector that has been digested with the same restriction enzyme. The vector containing the inserted fragments of genomic DNA can then be introduced into a host organism.|$|E
50|$|After a <b>genomic</b> <b>library</b> is {{constructed}} with a viral vector, such as lambda phage, the titer {{of the library}} can be determined. Calculating the titer allows researchers to approximate how many infectious viral particles were successfully created in the library. To do this, dilutions of the library are used to transfect cultures of E. coli of known concentrations. The cultures are then plated on agar plates and incubated overnight. The number of viral plaques are counted {{and can be used}} to calculate the total number of infectious viral particles in the library. Most viral vectors also carry a marker that allows clones containing an insert to be distinguished from those that do not have an insert. This allows researchers to also determine the percentage of infectious viral particles actually carrying a fragment of the library.|$|E

50|$|The {{strategy}} of chromosome walking {{is based on}} the assumption that it is difficult and time consuming to find DNA markers that are physically close to a gene of interest. Recent technological developments invalidate this assumption for many species. As a result, the mapping paradigm has now changed such that one first isolates one or more DNA marker(s) at a physical distance from the targeted gene that is less than the average insert size of the <b>genomic</b> <b>library</b> being used for clone isolation. The DNA marker is then used to screen the library and isolate (or 'land' on) the clone containing the gene, without any need for chromosome walking and its associated problems. Chromosome landing, together with the technology that has made it possible, is likely to become the main strategy by which map-based cloning is applied to isolate both major genes and genes underlying quantitative traits in plant species.|$|E
