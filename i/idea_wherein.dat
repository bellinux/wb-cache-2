60|$|But, {{to deduce}} {{this a little}} more distinctly, it will not perhaps be amiss to trace our notions and names from their beginning, and observe by what degrees we proceed, and by what steps we enlarge our ideas from our first infancy. There is nothing more evident, than that {{the ideas of the}} persons {{children}} converse with (to instance in them alone) are, like the persons themselves, only particular. The ideas of the nurse and the mother are well framed in their minds; and, like pictures of them there, represent only those individuals. The names they first gave to them are confined to these individuals; and the names of NURSE and MAMMA, the child uses, determine themselves to those persons. Afterwards, when time and a larger acquaintance have made them observe that there are a great many other things in the world, that in some common agreements of shape, and several other qualities, resemble their father and mother, and those persons they have been used to, they frame an idea, which they find those many particulars do partake in; and to that they give, with others, the name MAN, for example. And thus they come to have a general name, and a general <b>idea.</b> <b>Wherein</b> they make nothing new; but only leave out of the complex idea they had of Peter and James, Mary and Jane, that which is peculiar to each, and retain only what is common to them all.|$|E
60|$|The idea of {{infinite}} has, I confess, something of positive {{in all those}} things we apply to it. When we would think {{of infinite}} space or duration, we at first step usually make some very large idea, as perhaps of millions of ages, or miles, which possibly we double and multiply several times. All that we thus amass together in our thoughts is positive, and the assemblage of {{a great number of}} positive ideas of space or duration. But what still remains beyond this we have no more a positive distinct notion of than a mariner has of the depth of the sea; where, having let down a large portion of his sounding-line, he reaches no bottom. Whereby he knows the depth to be so many fathoms, and more; but how much the more is, he hath no distinct notion at all: and could he always supply new line, and find the plummet always sink, without ever stopping, he would be something in the posture of the mind reaching after a complete and positive idea of infinity. In which case, let this line be ten, or ten thousand fathoms long, it equally discovers what is beyond it, and gives only this confused and comparative idea, that this is not all, but one may yet go farther. So much as the mind comprehends of any space, it has a positive idea of: but in endeavouring to make it infinite,--it being always enlarging, always advancing,--the idea is still imperfect and incomplete. So much space as the mind takes a view of in its contemplation of greatness, is a clear picture, and positive in the understanding: but infinite is still greater. 1. Then the idea of SO MUCH is positive and clear. 2. The idea of GREATER is also clear; but it is but a comparative idea, the idea of SO MUCH GREATER AS CANNOT BE COMPREHENDED. 3. And this is plainly negative: not positive. For he has no positive clear idea of the largeness of any extension, (which is that sought for in the idea of infinite), that has not a comprehensive idea of the dimensions of it: and such, nobody, I think, pretends to in what is infinite. For to say a man has a positive clear idea of any quantity, without knowing how great it is, is as reasonable as to say, he has the positive clear idea of the number of the sands on the sea-shore, who knows not how many there be, but only that they are more than twenty. For just such a perfect and positive idea has he of an infinite space or duration, who says it is LARGER THAN the extent or duration of ten, one hundred, one thousand, or any other number of miles, or years, whereof he has or can have a positive idea; which is all the idea, I think, we have of infinite. So that what lies beyond our positive idea TOWARDS infinity, lies in obscurity, and has the indeterminate confusion of a negative <b>idea,</b> <b>wherein</b> I know I neither do nor can comprehend all I would, it being too large for a finite and narrow capacity. And that cannot but be very far from a positive complete <b>idea,</b> <b>wherein</b> the greatest part of what I would comprehend is left out, under the undeterminate intimation of being still greater. For to say, that, having in any quantity measured so much, or gone so far, you are not yet at the end, is only to say that that quantity is greater. So that the negation of an end in any quantity is, in other words, only {{to say that it is}} bigger; and a total negation of an end is but carrying this bigger still with you, in all the progressions your thoughts shall make in quantity; and adding this IDEA OF STILL GREATER to ALL the ideas you have, or can be supposed to have, of quantity. Now, whether such an idea as that be positive, I leave any one to consider.|$|E
60|$|Secondly, OUR COMPLEX IDEAS OF MODES, being {{voluntary}} {{collections of}} simple ideas, which the mind puts together, {{without reference to}} any real archetypes, or standing patterns, existing anywhere, are and cannot but be ADEQUATE IDEAS. Because they, not being intended for copies of things really existing, but for archetypes made by the mind, to rank and denominate things by, cannot want anything; they having each of them that combination of ideas, and thereby that perfection, which the mind intended they should: so that the mind acquiesces in them, and can find nothing wanting. Thus, by having {{the idea of a}} figure with three sides meeting at three angles, I have a complete <b>idea,</b> <b>wherein</b> I require nothing else to make it perfect. That the mind is satisfied with the perfection of this its idea is plain, in that it does not conceive that any understanding hath, or can have, a more complete or perfect idea of that thing it signifies by the word triangle, supposing it to exist, than itself has, in that complex idea of three sides and three angles, in which is contained all that is or can be essential to it, or necessary to complete it, wherever or however it exists. But in our IDEAS OF SUBSTANCES it is otherwise. For there, desiring to copy things as they really do exist, and to represent to ourselves that constitution on which all their properties depend, we perceive our ideas attain not that perfection we intend: we find they still want something we should be glad were in them; and so are all inadequate. But MIXED MODES and RELATIONS, being archetypes without patterns, and so having nothing to represent but themselves, cannot but be adequate, everything being so to itself. He that at first put together the idea of danger perceived, absence of disorder from fear, sedate consideration of what was justly to be done, and executing that without disturbance, or being deterred by the danger of it, had certainly in his mind that complex idea made up of that combination: and intending it to be nothing else but what is, nor to have in it any other simple ideas but what it hath, it could not also but be an adequate idea: and laying this up in his memory, with the name COURAGE annexed to it, to signify to others, and denominate from thence any action he should observe to agree with it, had thereby a standard to measure and denominate actions by, as they agreed to it. This idea, thus made and laid up for a pattern, must necessarily be adequate, being referred to nothing else but itself, nor made by any other original but the good liking and will of him that first made this combination.|$|E

They want not their reasons who think there are, and that each fixed star would answer the idea the name sun stands for, to one who was placed in a due distance: which, by the way, may show us how much the sorts, or, if you please, GENERA and SPECIES of things (for those Latin terms signify to me no more than the English word sort) depend on such collections of ideas as men have made, and not on the real nature of things; since it is not impossible but that, in propriety of speech, that might be a sun to one which is a star to another.|$|R
60|$|FIRST, That {{they are}} not the truths first known to the mind is evident to experience, as we have shown in another place. (Book I. chap, 1.) Who {{perceives}} not that a child certainly knows that a stranger is not its mother; that its sucking-bottle is not the rod, long before he knows that 'it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be?' And how many truths are there about numbers, which it is obvious to observe that the mind is perfectly acquainted with, and fully convinced of, before it ever thought on these general maxims, to which mathematicians, in their arguings, do sometimes refer them? Whereof the reason is very plain: for that which makes the mind assent to such propositions, being nothing else but the perception it has of the agreement or disagreement of its ideas, according as it finds them affirmed or denied one of another in words it understands; and every idea being known to be what it is, and every two distinct ideas being known not to be the same; it must necessarily follow that such self-evident truths must be first known which consist of ideas that are first in the mind. And the ideas first in the mind, it is evident, are those of particular things, from whence by slow degrees, the understanding proceeds to some few general ones; which being taken from the ordinary and familiar objects of sense, are settled in the mind, with general names to them. Thus PARTICULAR IDEAS are first received and distinguished, and so knowledge got about them; and next to them, the less general or specific, which are next to particular. For abstract ideas are not so obvious or easy to children, or the yet unexercised mind, as particular ones. If they seem so to grown men, it is only because by constant and familiar use they are made so. For, when we nicely reflect upon them, we shall find that GENERAL IDEAS are fictions and contrivances of the mind, that carry difficulty with them and do not so easily offer themselves as we are apt to imagine. For example, does it not require some pains and skill to form the general idea of a triangle,(which is yet none of the more abstract, comprehensive, and difficult,) for it must be neither oblique nor rectangle, neither equilateral, equicrural, nor scalinon; but all and none of these at once. In effect, it is something imperfect, that cannot exist; an <b>idea</b> <b>wherein</b> some part of several different and inconsistant ideas are put together. It is true, the mind, in this imperfect state, has need of such ideas, and makes all the haste to them it can, for the conveniency of communication and enlargement of knowledge; to both which it is naturally very much inclined. But yet one has reason to suspect such ideas are marks of our imperfection; at least, this is enough to show that the most abstract and general ideas are not those that the mind is first and most easily acquainted with, nor such as its earliest knowledge is conversant about.|$|E

40|$|Much of the {{scholarship}} on Europeanization has explained eastern enlargement {{according to the}} logics of materialism or constructivism. Materialists argue that candidates' compliance with conditionality demands is rooted in strong external material incentives and a credible shot at membership, while constructivists point to shared identities, norms and values. These are valuable insights, yet they do not address a critical missing element - how the dispersion of ideas influences institutional outcomes in candidate states. This research demonstrates {{that in order for}} the EU to have a transformative impact on the political institutions of the states of former Yugoslavia, national political leaders must be able to communicate a satisfying narrative of EU legitimacy that resonates with national narratives of legitimacy when justifying policy choices. The project goes beyond an analysis of compliant/non-compliant behavior to unearth a greater understanding of how, at the hour of accession, elite discourse operates as an agent to reshape histories, form new identities, and mold preferences. Together these processes have profound policy implications for the new regimes, as they lead to decisions that are consequential for institutional development at both the EU and state level. In particular, using a combination of content analysis and an original elite survey, this research finds that elites' ability to express power through ideas and over ideas can transform power in ideas for the cases of Croatia and Serbia/Kosovo. For Croatia, this entails elites creating conditions whereby the public believes in the idea that EU membership represents an 'escape' from the Balkans as opposed to a 'return' to Europe. For Serbia/Kosovo, elites strive to convince citizens that EU membership signifies a 're-branding' of the Balkan image rather than an escape.

60|$|How {{much the}} {{imperfection}} of accurately discriminating ideas one from another lies, {{either in the}} dulness or faults of the organs of sense; or want of acuteness, exercise, or attention in the understanding; or hastiness and precipitancy, natural to some tempers, I will not here examine: it suffices to take notice, {{that this is one}} of the operations that the mind may reflect on and observe in itself. It is of that consequence to its other knowledge, that so far as this faculty is in itself dull, or not rightly made use of, for the distinguishing one thing from another,--so far our notions are confused, and our reason and judgment disturbed or misled. If in having our ideas in the memory ready at hand consists quickness of parts; in this, of having them unconfused, and being able nicely to distinguish one thing from another, where there is but the least difference, consists, in a great measure, the exactness of judgment, and clearness of reason, which is to be observed in one man above another. And hence perhaps may be given some reason of that common observation,--that men who have a great deal of wit, and prompt memories, have not always the clearest judgment or deepest reason. For WIT lying most in the assemblage of ideas, and putting those together with quickness and variety, wherein can be found any resemblance or congruity, thereby to make up pleasant pictures and agreeable visions in the fancy; JUDGMENT, on the contrary, lies quite on the other side, in separating carefully, one from another, <b>ideas</b> <b>wherein</b> can be found the least difference, thereby to avoid being misled by similitude, and by affinity to take one thing for another.

40|$|Several {{data mining}} {{problems}} {{are characterized by}} data in high dimensions. One of the popular {{ways to reduce the}} dimensionality of the data is to perform feature selection, i. e, select a subset of relevant and non-redundant features. Recently, Quadratic Programming Feature Selection (QPFS) has been proposed which formulates the feature selection problem as a quadratic program. It has been shown to outperform many of the existing feature selection methods for a variety of applications. Though, better than many existing approaches, the running time complexity of QPFS is cubic in the number of features, which can be quite computationally expensive even for moderately sized datasets. In this paper we propose a novel method for feature selection by integrating k-means clustering with QPFS. The basic variant of our approach runs k-means to bring down the number of features which need to be passed on to QPFS. We then enhance this <b>idea,</b> <b>wherein</b> we gradually refine the feature space from a very coarse clustering to a fine-grained one, by interleaving steps of QPFS with k-means clustering. Every step of QPFS helps in identifying the clusters of irrelevant features (which can then be thrown away), whereas every step of k-means further refines the clusters which are potentially relevant. We show that our iterative refinement of clusters is guaranteed to converge. We provide bounds on the number of distance computations involved in the k-means algorithm. Further, each QPFS run is now cubic in number of clusters, which can be much smaller than actual number of features. Experiments on eight publicly available datasets show that our approach gives significant computational gains (both in time and memory), over standard QPFS as well as other state of the art feature selection methods, even while improving the overall accuracy.

40|$|This paper aims {{to analyze}} {{theories}} developed both in favor and against privacy protection according to current {{practices in the}} West. In the paper, we will examine economic justifications for privacy protection as defined by American economists and jurists, {{as well as the}} advantages to be derived by a possible elimination of said protection. Moving beyond existing economic theories, this piece develops a new economic <b>idea,</b> <b>wherein</b> privacy protection is warranted when an individual becomes interested in another's habits for a specific reason: to root out different behaviors in that person by observing a behavior that is correlated with those behaviors. Imagine the scenario of a worker who is also a soccer player, who is not competitive on the job, and is a team player, when he plays soccer, with his co-workers. The two facts, one of loving his own soccer team, and second, of not being competitive in the workplace are expressions of the same human attitude, or of a certain aspect of his personality. The employer is interested in finding out if this worker plays soccer in order to identify a lack of competitiveness on the job, and perhaps to assign him more menial tasks. The employer wishes to know the worker's interest in soccer in order to deduce therefrom a second circumstance: non-competitiveness in the workplace. Thus if regulating others' conduct is not forbidden, the worker, in order not to be found out, will no longer play soccer; he will suffer a loss in terms of his personal welfare, while the employer, on the other hand, will gain nothing, having discovered nothing. From this comes a different justification for privacy protection. In the paper, however, we note that privacy protection is a tool for encouraging equality or, in pejorative terms, egalitarianism. Behind the privacy “screen,” indeed, everyone appears in shades of gray. Privacy protection makes individuals indistinguishable. In terms of inter-personal relationships, this means a “veil” of ignorance, with all its attendant costs. Therefore, {{it is possible that the}} economic justifications defined by those in favor of privacy protection should be put aside in favor of transparency among individuals. ...|$|E
60|$|All our {{knowledge}} consisting, as I have said, {{in the view}} the mind has of its own ideas, which is the utmost light and greatest certainty we, with our faculties, and in our way of knowledge, are capable of, {{it may not be}} amiss to consider a little the degrees of its evidence. The different clearness of {{our knowledge}} seems to me to lie in the different way of perception the mind has of the agreement or disagreement of any of its ideas. For if we will reflect on our own ways of thinking, we will find, that sometimes the mind perceives the agreement or disagreement of two ideas IMMEDIATELY BY THEMSELVES, without the intervention of any other: and this I think we may call INTUITIVE KNOWLEDGE. For in this the mind is at no pains of proving or examining, but perceives the truth as the eye doth light, only by being directed towards it. Thus the mind perceives that WHITE is not BLACK, that a CIRCLE is not a TRIANGLE, that THREE are more than TWO and equal to ONE AND TWO. Such kinds of truths the mind perceives at the first sight of the ideas together, by bare intuition; without the intervention of any other idea: and this kind of knowledge is the clearest and most certain that human frailty is capable of. This part of knowledge is irresistible, and, like bright sunshine, forces itself immediately to be perceived, as soon as ever the mind turns its view that way; and leaves no room for hesitation, doubt, or examination, but the mind is presently filled with the clear light of it. IT IS ON THIS INTUITION THAT DEPENDS ALL THE CERTAINTY AND EVIDENCE OF ALL OUR KNOWLEDGE; which certainty every one finds to be so great, that he cannot imagine, and therefore not require a greater: for a man cannot conceive himself capable of a greater certainty than to know that any idea in his mind is such as he perceives it to be; and that two <b>ideas,</b> <b>wherein</b> he perceives a difference, are different and not precisely the same. He that demands a greater certainty than this, demands he knows not what, and shows only that he has a mind to be a sceptic, without being able to be so. Certainty depends so wholly on this intuition, that, in the next degree of knowledge which I call demonstrative, this intuition is necessary in all the connexions of the intermediate ideas, without which we cannot attain knowledge and certainty.|$|R
40|$|A situational-adaption {{perspective}} is {{developed as a}} basis of an analytic illness behavior paradigm. The situational-adaption {{perspective is}} derived from the <b>ideas</b> of Dubos <b>wherein</b> health is viewed as adaption and the interactionist conception of the defined social situation. The situational-adaption perspective is then applied to symptomatic episodes where signs and symptoms are contained in everyday situations without direct medical consultation, everyday illness behavior; to illness experiences where coping necessitates medical consultation, acute illness behavior; to chronic diseases where adjustment and long-term care are necessary, chronic illness behavior; and to emergent life threatening illness episodes which require definitive medical care, life threatening illness behavior. For each of these illness behavior types a primary process, role behavior and patient-practitioner relations are specified. ...|$|R

One incarnation of this <b>idea</b> is simulation <b>wherein</b> the programmer may describe a world and multiple agents that interact within it. A next step is adding interactivity, wherein humans and computers collaborate to form a creative work or a dialogue, e. g. by the human participant manually introducing new constraints or goals into a simulation. In the former setting we {{are more interested in}} the artifact whereas in the latter we are more interested in the process. Both of these settings ask questions about knowledge representation and conditional actions, for which I believe the PL formalisms have been underexplored...|$|R
40|$|Different ways of {{representing}} urban environment or city correspond to diverse ideas in considering them. On this respect, the studies tradition based on history and urban morphology use mostly the geometric survey at architectural and urban scale to interpret {{and describe the}} city or its parts. On the other hand, {{the approach based on}} experience, like the townscape of Gordon Cullen, prefers sketches, drawings, perspectives, watercolors. So analytical techniques respond to design approaches and different cultural interpretation and almost three are the emerging key concepts in facing analysis of urban places: further, the urban morphology and environment approaches, another one shows its relevance: the <b>idea</b> of ambiance <b>wherein</b> is crucial subjectivity and sensory perceptions. To fulﬁll a description not only based on quantitative parameters but also on qualitative requirements, it needs reconsidering the “map” and taking into account what is now emerging from new digital technologies...|$|R
40|$|The {{world is}} {{occupied}} by many and varied things. What constitutes their thingness? In the Essay, Locke addresses this question in Book II, Chapter xxiii, titled ‘Of our Complex <b>Ideas</b> of Substance’, <b>wherein</b> the much-contested definition of ‘substratum’ appears—‘a supposed but unknown support of the Qualities’. Most significant in this definition are the dual qualifiers that Locke uses: ‘supposed’ and ‘unknown’. This paper examines this two-qualifier definition, illuminating the historical and philosophical significance it may have. There have been two rival readings. The first takes Locke’s substratum to be a bare substratum; and the second identifies it with what Locke terms as ‘real essence’—i. e. ‘a real Constitution of the insensible Parts’. Critically reviewing these two major interpretations, I attribute to Locke a type of functionalism, according to which {{the status of a}} substratum is determined by its functional role of ‘uniting’ a bundle of qualities into an individual substance...|$|R

[It {{has been}} {{generally}} taken for granted, that mathematics alone {{are capable of}} demonstrative certainty: but to have such an agreement or disagreement as may intuitively be perceived, being, as I imagine, not the privilege of the ideas of number, extension, and figure alone, it may possibly be the want of due method and application in us, and not of sufficient evidence in things, that demonstration has been thought to have so little to do {{in other parts of}} knowledge, and been scarce so much as aimed at by any but mathematicians.] For whatever <b>ideas</b> we have <b>wherein</b> the mind can perceive the immediate agreement or disagreement that is between them, there the mind is capable of intuitive knowledge; and where it can perceive the agreement or disagreement of any two ideas, by an intuitive perception of the agreement or disagreement they have with any intermediate ideas, there the mind is capable of demonstration: which is not limited to ideas of extension, figure, number, and their modes.|$|R
40|$|Real-time {{heuristic}} search algorithms {{are suitable for}} situated agents that need to make their decisions in constant time. Since the original work by Korf nearly two decades ago, numerous extensions have been suggested. One {{of the most intriguing}} extensions is the <b>idea</b> of backtracking <b>wherein</b> the agent decides to return to a previously visited state as opposed to moving forward greedily. This idea has been empirically shown to {{have a significant impact on}} various performance measures. The studies have been carried out in particular empirical testbeds with specific real-time search algorithms that use backtracking. Consequently, the extent to which the trends observed are characteristic of backtracking in general is unclear. In this paper, we present the first entirely theoretical study of backtracking in real-time {{heuristic search}}. In particular, we present upper bounds on the solution cost exponential and linear in a parameter regulating the amount of backtracking. The results hold for a wide class of real-time heuristic search algorithms that includes many existing algorithms as a small subclass...|$|R
40|$|A {{new form}} of digital {{economic}} circulation has emerged, <b>wherein</b> <b>ideas,</b> knowledge, labour and use rights for otherwise idle assets move between geographically distributed but connected and interactive online communities. Such circulation is apparent across a number of digital economic ecologies, including social media, online marketplaces, crowdsourcing, crowdfunding and other manifestations of the so-called ‘sharing economy’. Prevailing accounts deploy concepts such as ‘co-production’, ‘prosumption’ and ‘peer-to-peer’ to explain digital economic circulation as networked exchange relations characterised by their disintermediated, collaborative and democratising qualities. Building from the neologism of platform capitalism, we place ‘the platform' — understood as a distinct mode of socio-technical intermediary and business arrangement that is incorporated into wider processes of capitalisation — at {{the centre of the}} critical analysis of digital economic circulation. To create multi-sided markets and coordinate network effects, platforms enrol users through a participatory economic culture and mobilise code and data analytics to compose immanent infrastructures. Platform intermediation is also nested in the ex-post construction of a replicable business model. Prioritising rapid up-scaling and extracting revenues from circulations and associated data trails, the model performs the structure of venture capital investment which capitalises on the potential of platforms to realise monopoly rents...|$|R
