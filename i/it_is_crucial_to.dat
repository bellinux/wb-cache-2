25|$|First and foremost, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> {{realize that}} Iranian {{authorities}} {{insist on a}} long-term commitment and a transfer of technology as a requisite for getting {{a share in the}} market. Foreign companies are therefore advised to adopt a medium- to long-term strategy for the Iranian market. Iran will almost never honor the interests of a company that does not show long-term commitment. Tenders are strictly required for government contracts for purchasing or projects. These are rarely competitive. Breaking up contracts into smaller parts is a common practice to try to incorporate at least 30% of the contract's value in local capability and also to negotiate on specific prices.|$|E
25|$|Other {{possible}} {{complications that}} may arise include: pericarditis, endocarditis, left ventricular failure, valvulitis and fibrosis. Many people with RA do not experience the same chest pain that others feel {{when they have}} angina or myocardial infarction. To reduce cardiovascular risk, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> maintain optimal control of the inflammation caused by RA (which {{may be involved in}} causing the cardiovascular risk), and to use exercise and medications appropriately to reduce other cardiovascular risk factors such as blood lipids and blood pressure. Doctors who treat people with RA should be sensitive to cardiovascular risk when prescribing anti-inflammatory medications, and may want to consider prescribing routine use of low doses of aspirin if the gastrointestinal effects are tolerable.|$|E
25|$|Nance {{provides}} {{a discussion on}} suicide attacks, and stresses that in most cases those who commit suicide by bombing other individuals are generally not psychotic in nature. He emphasizes that these individuals {{are for the most}} part logical and smart people with extremist religious viewpoints. While not attempting to explain their acts, Nance notes <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> comprehend terrorists' thought processes so that law enforcement officials may attempt to anticipate them. The book goes over common tactics used by clandestine cell systems and sleeper agents. Nance notes such organizations are a key component to terror operations, and require additional study. He gives forth an analysis of different types of clandestine cell systems, explaining common methodologies, covert communication methods, and from where they recruit their agents.|$|E

30|$|Due to {{the fact}} that {{different}} scientific communities have different perceptions of the same terms and concepts, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> avoid the logical errors and idiosyncratic decisions when constructing the thesaurus. Therefore, the demand for objectivity in designing and establishing the top-concepts of the thesaurus leads us to look for formal rules such as the CIDOC CRM Model.|$|R
25|$|Direct {{detection}} experiments aim {{to observe}} low-energy recoils (typically a few keVs) of nuclei induced by interactions with particles of dark matter, which (in theory) are {{passing through the}} Earth. After such a recoil the nucleus will emit energy as e.g. scintillation light or phonons, which is then detected by sensitive apparatus. In order to do this effectively <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> maintain a low background, and so such experiments operate deep underground to reduce the interference from cosmic rays. Examples of underground laboratories which house direct detection experiments include the Stawell mine, the Soudan mine, the SNOLAB underground laboratory at Sudbury, the Gran Sasso National Laboratory, the Canfranc Underground Laboratory, the Boulby Underground Laboratory, the Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory and the China Jinping Underground Laboratory.|$|E
25|$|Another type plating out organisms, next to streaking, on {{agar plates}} is the spot {{analysis}}. This type of analysis {{is often used}} to check the viability of cells and performed with pinners (often also called froggers). A third used technique is the use of sterile, glass, beads to plate out cells. In this technique cells are grown in a liquid culture of which a small volume is pipetted on the agar plate and then spread out with the sterile, glass beads. Replicate plating is another technique in order to plate out cells on agar plates. These four techniques are the most used ones, but others are also possible. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> work in a sterile manner in order to prevent contamination on the agar plates. Plating is thus often done in a laminar flow cabinet or on the working bench next to a bunsen burner.|$|E
25|$|Another typical {{disorder}} where {{auditory hallucinations}} are very common is dissociative identity disorder. In schizophrenia voices are normally perceived coming {{from outside the}} person but in dissociative disorders they are perceived as originating from within the person, commenting in their head not behind their back. Differential diagnosis between schizophrenia and dissociative disorders is challenging due to many overlapping symptoms especially Schneiderian first rank symptoms such as hallucinations. However, many people not suffering from diagnosable mental illness may sometimes hear voices as well. One important example to consider when forming a differential diagnosis for a patient with paracusia is lateral temporal lobe epilepsy. Despite the tendency to associate hearing voices, or otherwise hallucinating, and psychosis with schizophrenia or other psychiatric illnesses, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> take into consideration that, even if a person does exhibit psychotic features, he/she does not necessarily suffer from a psychiatric disorder on its own. Disorders such as Wilson's disease, various endocrine diseases, numerous metabolic disturbances, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, porphyria, sarcoidosis, and many others can present with psychosis.|$|E
50|$|Ajax Films was an Australian {{production}} company and studio that operated in the 1960s and 1970s. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> {{the revival of}} the Australian film and TV industry in the 1970s because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> involved in many of the early feature films from that era, either as a production partner or provider of facilities.

50|$|In many ancient societies, girls' {{upbringing}} {{had much}} to do with preparing them to be future wives. In many cultures, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not the norm for women to be economically independent.

30|$|This study {{intends to}} {{investigate}} the effects of early therapy to latently infected individuals {{and the role of}} non-compliance to leprosy dynamics. Adhering to a treatment schedule and successfully completing <b>it</b> <b>are</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> the control of any disease [5, 9].

500|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> {{note that}} {{the shape of the}} PPF depends {{on the nature of the}} {{technology}} in use. Here, technology refers to the type of returns to scale prevalent. In figure 6, the underlying assumption is the usual decreasing returns to scale, due to which the PPF is concave to the origin. In case we assumed increasing returns to scale, say if Crusoe embarked upon a mass production movement and hence faced decreasing costs, the PPF would be convex to the origin. The PPF is linear with a downward slope in two circumstances: ...|$|E
500|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> {{keep the}} cargo level during loading {{in order to}} {{maintain}} stability. As the hold is filled, machines such as excavators and bulldozers are often used to keep the cargo in check. Leveling is particularly important when the hold is only partly full, since cargo is more likely to shift. Extra precautions are taken, such as adding longitudinal divisions and securing wood atop the cargo. If a hold is full, a technique called tomming is used, which involves digging out a [...] hole below the hatch cover and filling it with bagged cargo or weights.|$|E

5|$|In his {{lab at the}} Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Nuttin {{designed}} {{experiments to}} test the hypothesis that people place a higher value on letters that feature in their name. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> the experimental design to rule out other factors, particularly mere exposure. If letters in a name are also letters that occur with higher frequency, then a preference for one's own letters might arise from the mere-exposure effect.|$|R

This phase, Analysis and Assessment, is the key and foundation of the seven lifecycle activities. [...] Without a solid foundation, the remaining CIP life cycle phases may be flawed, resulting in a CIP plan that fails to protect the critical infrastructure and, therefore, mission assurance.|$|E
2500|$|For the {{emission}} standards to deliver real emission reductions <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> use a test cycle that reflects real-world driving style. It {{was discovered that}} vehicle manufacturers would optimise emissions performance only during the test cycle, whilst emissions from typical driving conditions proved to be much higher than tested. Some manufacturers were also found to use so-called defeat devices where the engine control system would recognise that the vehicle was being tested, and would automatically switch to a mode optimised for emissions performance. The use of a defeat device is expressly forbidden in EU law.|$|E
2500|$|For healthy people, the Target Heart Rate or Training Heart Rate (THR) is {{a desired}} range of heart rate reached during aerobic {{exercise}} which enables one's {{heart and lungs}} to receive the most benefit from a workout. This theoretical range varies based mostly on age; however, a person's physical condition, sex, and previous training also {{are used in the}} calculation. Below are two ways to calculate one's THR. In each of these methods, there is an element called [...] "intensity" [...] which is expressed as a percentage. The THR can be calculated as a range of 65–85% intensity. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> derive an accurate HRmax to ensure these calculations are meaningful.|$|E
5000|$|Although proving {{this result}} of [...] "rational linear {{independence}} implies algebraic linear independence" [...] for two elements of L was sufficient for his and Schneider's result, Gelfond felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> extend this result to arbitrarily many elements of L.

50|$|The goddess {{represented}} the era's regard for women, because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> maintain {{the spirit in}} her image, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> this idea of eternal life and of maturity that Isis reflected, venerated as the Celestial Mother. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> in this role that Isis was arguably made the most important deity of Egyptian mythology. Her influence even extended to religions of different civilizations, where she would become identified under different names and where her cult grew, particularly in the Roman Empire.|$|R
2500|$|Phillip Brown and Hugh Lauder quotes Bowles and Gintis (1976) that {{in order}} to truly define {{collective}} intelligence, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> separate 'intelligence' from IQism. They go on to argue that intelligence is an achievement and can only be developed if allowed to. For example, earlier on, groups from the lower levels of society are severely restricted from aggregating and pooling their intelligence. This is because the elites fear that the collective intelligence would convince the people to rebel. If there is no such capacity and relations, there would be no infrastructure on which collective intelligence is built [...] This reflects how powerful collective intelligence can be if left to develop.|$|E
2500|$|The {{measurement}} {{volume is}} a convolution of illumination (excitation) and detection geometries, which {{result from the}} optical elements involved. The resulting volume is described mathematically by the point spread function (or PSF), it is essentially {{the image of a}} point source. The PSF is often described as an ellipsoid (with unsharp boundaries) of few hundred nanometers in focus diameter, and almost one micrometer along the optical axis. The shape varies significantly (and has a large impact on the resulting FCS curves) depending {{on the quality of the}} optical elements (<b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> avoid astigmatism and to check the real shape of the PSF on the instrument). In the case of confocal microscopy, and for small pinholes (around one Airy unit), the PSF is well approximated by Gaussians: ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{frequent}} {{question and}} point of {{confusion in the}} ToK System is the definition and meaning of consciousness. As mentioned above, mind is not synonymous with consciousness. And, to understand consciousness from a ToK vantage point, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>to</b> recognize that the term is often ambiguous in its meaning. Two primary meanings are sentience, which is the capacity for mental experience and self-awareness, which is the capacity {{to be aware of}} one's awareness. Sentience is conceptualized as a [...] "level 3" [...] phenomena, possessed by many animals other than humans and is defined as a [...] "perceived" [...] electro-neuro-chemical representation of animal-environment relations. The ingredient of neurological behavior that allows for the emergence of mental experience is considered the [...] "hard" [...] problem of conscious and the ToK System does not address this question explicitly. In contrast, through the Justification Hypothesis (see below), the ToK System involves a very direct analysis of the other issue of consciousness, that of self-awareness.|$|E
