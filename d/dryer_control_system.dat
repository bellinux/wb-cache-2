40|$|Currently {{excessive}} {{fossil fuel}} consumption has become a serious problem. People are searching for new solutions of energy production {{and there are several}} options to obtain alternative sources of energy without further devastating the already destroyed environment. One of these solutions is growing microalgae, from which biodiesel can be obtained. The microalgae production is a growing business because of its many useful compounds. In order to collect these compounds microalgae must first be harvested and then dried. Nowadays the solutions used for drying use too much energy and therefore are too expensive and not sustainable. The goal of this project, one of the possible choices during the EPS@ISEP 2013 Spring, was to develop a solar microalgae dryer. The multinational team involved in its development was composed of five students, from distinct countries and fields of study, and was the responsible for designing a solar microalgae dryer prototype for the microalgae laboratory of the chemical engineering department at ISEP, suitable for future tests and incorporating control process (in order not to destroy the microalgae during the drying process). The solar microalgae dryer was built to work as a distiller that gets rid of the excess water from the microalgae suspension. This paper presents a possible solution for this problem, the steps to create the device to harvest the microalgae by drying them with the use of solar energy (also used as an energy source for the solar <b>dryer</b> <b>control</b> <b>system),</b> the technologies used to build the solar microalgae dryer, and the benefits it presents compared to current solutions. It also presents the device from the ethical and sustainable viewpoint. Such alternative to already existing methods is competitive as far as energy usage is concerned...|$|E
40|$|In this research, {{a hybrid}} <b>control</b> <b>system</b> is {{proposed}} {{to address the}} temperature control of an infrared <b>dryer.</b> The <b>control</b> <b>system</b> includes a feedback-predictive controller and a neural network steady state control law. The feedback-predictive controller outputs the amplified value of the predicted error as the transient control command. The predictive model was employed to suppress the undesirable effect of the dead-time of the system. A multilayer perceptron was designed and tested based on a control equilibrium point and steady state control {{to be used as}} a feedforward controller. The stability of the <b>control</b> <b>system</b> in a continuous domain was proved with no limit on the amplification gain of the predictive-feedback controller. In other words, there is no concern about losing stability with accelerating convergence towards the reference.

40|$|Abstract Gelcasting is a {{new method}} for {{manufacturing}} advanced structural ceramics for use, for example, in the aerospace industry. The process involves a drying stage, where moisture, which constitutes approximately {{a quarter of the}} mass of the part, is removed in a commercial <b>dryer.</b> The <b>control</b> <b>system</b> design for the gelcast ceramic drying process is complicated by the requirement of minimizing the drying time while avoiding cracking during shrinkage of the part. This paper describes the application of the Lyapunov theory for finding an exponentially stablizing controller for the nonlinear drying model. A RealSim TRapid Prototyping model and the MATRIXx Tdesign automation environment are used for real-time control, as well as feedback system implementation.

40|$|Abstract Drying, {{especially}} rotary drying, {{is without}} doubt {{one of the}} oldest and most common unit operations in the process industries. Rotary dryers are workhorses which are easy and reliable to operate, but neither energy-efficient nor environmentally friendly. In order to conform better to the requirements of modern society concerning working conditions, safety practices and environmental aspects, the development of <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> can provide opportunities for improving dryer operation and efficiency. Our in depth understanding of rotary drying is poor, because it is a very complex process that includes the movement of solids in addition to thermal drying. Thus even today rotary <b>dryers</b> are <b>controlled</b> partly manually, based on the operator's "eye" and experience, and partly relying on conventional control methods. The control of a rotary dryer is difficult due to the long time delay, which means that accidental variations in the input variables can disturb the process for long periods of time before they are reflected in the output variables. To eliminate such disturbances at an early stage, increasing interest has been shown in more sophisticated <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> such as model-based constructs, fuzzy logic and neural nets in recent years. Although it has proved difficult and time-consuming to develop model-based <b>control</b> <b>systems,</b> due to the complexity of the process, intelligent control methods based on fuzzy logic and neural nets offer attractive solutions for improving <b>dryer</b> <b>control.</b> These methods make it possible to utilize experience, knowledge and historical data, large amounts of which are readily available. The aim of this research was to improve <b>dryer</b> <b>control</b> by developing new hybrid <b>control</b> <b>systems,</b> one consisting of a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) and PI controller and the other of a three-layer neural network (NN) and PI controller. The FLC and NN act as supervisory controllers giving set points for the PI controllers. The performance of each was examined both with simulations and in pilot plant experiments. The pilot plant dryer at the University of Oulu closely resembles a real industrial situation, so that the results are relevant. Evaluation of these results showed that the intelligent hybrid controllers are well suited for the control of a rotary dryer, giving a performance in which disturbances can be eliminated rapidly and operation of the dryer can thereby be improved, with the aim of enhancing its efficiency and environmental friendliness...|$|R
