The thickness of the films are measured by capacitance method, weighing method and cross checked by <b>electronic</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>instrument</b> (Tesatronic-TTD 20). IR spectrum is used to identify the coated films. The coated films are identified by IR spectrum. No pits and pin holes are found on the surface. The XRD spectrum indicated the amorphous nature of the films studied. Aluminium/PVA/Aluminum sandwich structures are formed to study the dielectric and AC conduction behaviour. The capacitance and dielectric loss of the films are measured in the frequency range of 0. 1 kHz to 100 kHz for various temperatures ranging from 290 K to 450 K. The observed increase of capacitance with the decrease of frequency in the lower frequency range can be assigned to charge carriers being blocked at the electrodes. The decrease of capacitance with increasing frequency is also attributed to the increasing inability of the dipoles to orient them selves in a rapidly varying electric field. The AC conductivity is found to {{vary according to the}} relation σac α ωn, where the value of n depends on temperature and frequency. The value of activation energy is found to be 0. 0015 eV ∼ 0. 007 eV for various temperatures confirms the amorphous nature of the film...|$|E

40|$|The Renewable Energy (RE) {{sector is}} {{one of the fastest growing}} new {{industries}} in the Republic of South Africa (RSA). The Bloomberg New Energy Finance Climate Scope Report recently ranked RSA third globally, behind China and Brazil, and first among African countries for investment in clean energy (Glickman, 2014). However, one of the main benefits to be derived from the industry, that of socio-economic and enterprise development, is not being achieved owing to unsuccessful management of revenue for beneficiary communities in the renewable energy sector in RSA. Challenges relating to good governance and long-term planning are causing significant harm to communities that are already vulnerable, and are threatening to have a negative effect on the industry’s ability to fulfil its obligation to alleviate and, ultimately, eradicate poverty in some of the poorest communities in RSA. The primary objective of this study is to develop a model for the successful management of revenue for beneficiary communities in the renewable energy sector in South Africa. The model will provide guidance for enterprises, stakeholders, industry experts and community development practitioners within the renewable energy sector towards a pro-active, effective, and relevant decision-making process to achieve success in managing revenue for beneficiary communities. To address the primary objective, a number of secondary objectives were established by developing a conceptual model comprising variables identified in a comprehensive survey of the related literature. A path diagram, based on the formulation of appropriate hypotheses, was constructed between the independent variable and subsequent intervening and dependent variables. Primary data sourced from the identified national and international population of project management practitioners were collected by means of an <b>electronic</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>instrument.</b> The data were analysed and tested empirically by means of Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The determinants that were identified through a review of the literature as influencing the success of managing revenue for beneficiary communities of renewable energy companies in South Africa included: the use of outside advice, strategic financial services, strategic planning, strategic partnerships, infrastructure development and project management. In order to achieve the objective, the following research questions were formulated: What is the influence of external factors such as outside advisers and support services on the perceived success of managing revenue for beneficiary communities of renewable energy companies in South Africa? The purpose of this research, therefore, was to evaluate and recommend new methodologies to the renewable energy sector by introducing a model of perceived success in managing revenue for beneficiary communities of renewable energy companies in South Africa. The study provided new insight into managing revenue for beneficiary communities in RSA. With the renewable energy sector being one of the fastest growing sectors in the RSA, and the RSA Government being determined to link the location of renewable energy facilities to economic development, this research has given new insight into managing revenue for SED and ED. The objectives of multi-sector participation, transformational change and sustainable initiatives for beneficiary communities could ensure greater consideration and care when managing beneficiary revenue. Thereby, the opportunity presented by the RE industry for beneficiary communities can change these communities dramatically for the better. The study makes a valuable contribution to the body of knowledge about managing revenue for beneficiary communities. The proposed model has led to a better understanding of the determinants that influence the success of managing revenue for beneficiary communities, namely: distinctive benefits (a combination of two variables: outside advice and support services), financial management, developmental benefits (a combination of two variables: infrastructure development and education), human development, project management and strategic planning.

On the glass opposite the leaves, pieces of tin foil may be pasted, so that when the leaves diverge fully they may discharge into the ground. [...] The leaves may be enclosed in a glass envelope to protect them from drafts, and the envelope may be evacuated to minimize charge leakage.

So the automatic detection system for the measurement of wooden surface profile viz. thickness & roughness occupies a very important role in that application. Present work is the study, to evaluate the thickness of the wooden block by implementing a contact type optical sensor. The traditional contact type thickness measuring sensors are inductive type, capacitive type and ultrasonic type. This measurement technique has some advantages and some drawbacks according to their measuring principles and environmental effects. In case of inductive type transducer sensitivity is truly affected by stray magnetic fields and severely dirt and other contaminants may produce difficulty for using capacitive type transducer. Beside this, ultrasonic vibration transducer avoids those physical phenomena but its dynamic reading is not suitable for moving materials. For this shortcoming, a new type of opto-imaging thickness gauge has been designed & fabricated. This proposed sensor principle is based on the effect of temporal changes of reflected light intensity due to an image. Hence, the variation of the wooden block thickness with respect to the reference plane is directly proportional to this light intensity information, due to which it has been recorded in terms of voltage utilizing signal processing circuit (SPC) for interfacing with the <b>electronic</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments.</b> The experimental result shows...|$|R

40|$|AC Analog {{voltmeters}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} popular <b>electronic</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>instruments</b> in use today. They are used to measure the RMS voltage of the many waveforms commonly found in electronics. This article will provide you with the basics of AC analog voltmeters. It will give you a better understanding of their operation, allowing you to select the right one for your particular measurement. The RMS or root-mean-square voltage is measured because this value gives us the most information about the waveform. The RMS voltage is equivalent to a DC voltage which produces the same heating effect as the AC signal being measured. For example, 1 volt of DC across a 1 ohm resistor will dissipate 1 watt. If we substitute any periodic waveform in place of the DC source and adjust its amplitude so that we again have 1 watt of power dissipated in the load, then our AC signal has an RMS or effective value of 1 volt. In addition to its RMS value, a waveform also has a peak and average voltage value. See Figure 1. ov This sine wave has an RMS value of 1 volt. Its peak value is 1. 4 times its RMS value, or 1. 4 volts. Its rectified average or DC value is. 636 times the peak or. 9 volts in the above example. AC voltmeters are designed to respond to one of these three values. This classifies the meters into true RMS responding, average responding and peak responding. The average and peak responding voltmeters are designed to measure only sine waves. Average Responding With an average responding voltmeter, a sine wave being measured is fed through a DC blocking capacitor, amplified or attenuated, rectified by the diode bridge and fed to the meter. The meter then responds to this rectified average or DC value. The average value of a sine wave is zero, so when we say average responding we mean the rectified average or DC component after rectification. This DC component deflects a d’Arsonval (moving coil) meter to indicate the RMS value of a sine wave...|$|R
