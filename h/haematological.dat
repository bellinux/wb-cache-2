25|$|Biochemical and <b>haematological</b> {{profiles}} {{are little}} investigated in definitive hosts. A decrease of haemoglobin, elevation of γ-globulins, and increase of eosinophils in serum {{was observed in}} experimentally infected white-tailed deer.|$|E
25|$|<b>Haematological</b> {{adverse effects}} include {{neutropenia}} (95.5%), anaemia (90.4%), febrile neutropenia (11.0%) and thrombocytopenia (8.0%). Deaths due to toxicity accounted for 1.7% of the 2045 patients, and incidence was increased (9.8%) {{in patients with}} elevated baseline liver function tests (liver dysfunction).|$|E
25|$|Dexamethasone is {{also used}} as a direct {{chemotherapeutic}} agent in certain <b>haematological</b> malignancies, especially {{in the treatment of}} multiple myeloma, in which dexamethasone is given alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs, including most commonly with thalidomide (Thal-dex), lenalidomide, bortezomib (Velcade, Vel-dex), or a combination of doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and vincristine or bortezomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone.|$|E
25|$|Sheep {{and goats}} die acutely without any {{previous}} clinical signs. Only elevation of eosinophils and slight increase of γ-globulins {{were observed in}} experimentally infected sheep. Recently, several changes in biochemical and <b>haematological</b> profile have been documented in experimentally infected goats. The significant increase of GLDH (glutamate dehydrogenase) was recorded from 14 weeks after infection in goats experimentally infected with F. magna.|$|E
25|$|Radiation is a {{potential}} cause of cancer, and secondary malignancies are seen {{in a very small}} minority of patients – usually less than 1/1000. It usually occurs 20 – 30 years following treatment, although some <b>haematological</b> malignancies may develop within 5 – 10 years. In the vast majority of cases, this risk is greatly outweighed by the reduction in risk conferred by treating the primary cancer. The cancer occurs within the treated area of the patient.|$|E
25|$|Transfusion-associated acute lung injury (TRALI) is a {{syndrome}} that {{is similar}} to Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which develops within 6 hours during a plasma-product containing blood products transfusion. Fever, hypotension, shortness of breath, and tachycardia often occurs in this type of reaction. It occurs in 15% of the transfused patient with mortality rate of 5 to 10%. Recipient risk factors includes: end-stage liver disease, sepsis, <b>haematological</b> malignancies, sepsis, and ventilated patients. Human Neutrophil Antigen (HNA) has been associated with this type of transfusion reaction. Donor's antibodies would interact with recipient's neutrophils and monocytes, releasing inflammatory cytokines and causes pulmonary capillary leakage. The treatment is supportive.|$|E
25|$|In animals, intravital {{diagnosis}} is based predominantly on faeces examinations and immunological methods. However, clinical signs, biochemical and <b>haematological</b> profile, season, climate conditions, epidemiology situation, and examinations of snails must be considered. Similarly to humans, faeces examinations are not reliable. Moreover, the fluke eggs are detectable in faeces 8–12 weeks post-infection. In {{spite of that}} fact, faecal examination is still the only used diagnostic tool in some countries. While coprological diagnosis of fasciolosis is possible from 8- to 12-week post-infection (WPI), F. hepatica specific-antibodies are recognized using ELISA or Western blot after 2-4 week post-infection. Therefore, these methods provide early detection of the infection.|$|E
25|$|One study {{based on}} a survey of medical teams covered {{approximately}} 24,000 peripheral blood HSCT cases between 1993 and 2005, and found a serious cardiovascular adverse reaction rate of about 1 in 1500. This study reported a cardiovascular-related fatality risk within the first 30 days HSCT of about 2 in 10000. For this same group, severe cardiovascular events were observed with {{a rate of about}} 1 in 1500. The most common severe adverse reactions were pulmonary edema/deep vein thrombosis, splenic rupture, and myocardial infarction. <b>Haematological</b> malignancy induction was comparable to that observed in the general population, with only 15 reported cases within 4 years.|$|E
25|$|Penicillins may {{decrease}} {{the elimination of}} methotrexate, so {{increase the risk of}} toxicity. While they may be used together, increased monitoring is recommended. The aminoglycosides, neomycin and paromomycin, have been found to reduce gastrointestinal (GI) absorption of methotrexate. Probenecid inhibits methotrexate excretion, which increases the risk of methotrexate toxicity. Likewise, retinoids and trimethoprim have been known to interact with methotrexate to produce additive hepatotoxicity and haematotoxicity, respectively. Other immunosuppressants like ciclosporin may potentiate methotrexate's haematologic effects, hence potentially leading to toxicity. NSAIDs have also been found to fatally interact with methotrexate in numerous case reports. Nitrous oxide potentiating the <b>haematological</b> toxicity of methotrexate has also been documented. Proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole and the anticonvulsant valproate have been found to increase the plasma concentrations of methotrexate, as have nephrotoxic agents such as cisplatin, the GI drug colestyramine, and dantrolene.|$|E
25|$|The {{classic example}} of {{targeted}} development is imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), a small molecule which inhibits a signaling molecule kinase. The genetic abnormality causing chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) {{has been known for}} a long time to be a chromosomal translocation creating an abnormal fusion protein, kinase BCR-ABL, which signals aberrantly, leading to uncontrolled proliferation of the leukemia cells. Imatinib precisely inhibits this kinase. Unlike so many other anti-cancer agents, this pharmaceutical was no accident. Brian Druker, working in Oregon Health & Science University, had extensively researched the abnormal enzyme kinase in CML. He reasoned that precisely inhibiting this kinase with a drug would control the disease and have little effect on normal cells. Druker collaborated with Novartis chemist Nicholas Lydon, who developed several candidate inhibitors. From these, imatinib was found to have the most promise in laboratory experiments. First Druker and then other groups worldwide demonstrated that when this small molecule is used to treat patients with chronic-phase CML, 90% achieve complete <b>haematological</b> remission. It is hoped that molecular targeting of similar defects in other cancers will have the same effect.|$|E
