50|$|It is {{difficult}} to assess {{the actual number of}} patents, because some of them were obtained before acquired companies joined Megger Group. The original Megger <b>insulation</b> <b>tester</b> patent is over 100 years old.|$|E
50|$|Lachinov's own inventions {{include a}} mercury pump, {{economizer}} for electricity consumption, electrical <b>insulation</b> <b>tester</b> (or defectoscope), optical dynamometer, a special types of photometer and electrolyser. One of his main achievements was {{a method of}} industrial synthesis of hydrogen and oxygen through electrolysis (1888).|$|E
50|$|The {{company is}} known for their {{original}} electrical <b>insulation</b> <b>testers,</b> and supply products related to the following areas: cable fault locating, earth/ground testing, low resistance measuring, power quality, electrical wiring, <b>insulation</b> <b>testers,</b> multimeters, portable appliance testers, clamp-on meters, current transformers, etc.|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{electromagnetic}} interference the first Megger <b>insulation</b> <b>testers</b> were built as two separate boxes - one for voltage generation {{and one for}} measurement. They were later integrated into a single device in a Bakelite case and special foldable handle for driving the dynamo. The most popular was the so-called [...] "Wee Megger" [...] (voltage up to 500 V and resistance up to 20 megohms), but there were larger devices like the [...] "Major Megger", [...] "Meg" [...] or [...] "Megger insulation tester", which could generate up to 2500 V and measure resistance up to 20,000 megohms.|$|R
50|$|Fluke's {{complete}} {{test and}} measurement line now includes digital multimeters, clamp meters, electrical testers, power quality analyzers, thermal imagers, <b>insulation</b> resistance <b>testers,</b> portable oscilloscopes, earth ground testers, infrared and contact thermometers, air quality meters, and vibration testers.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{them was}} a [...] "hand dynamo", which allowed {{generation}} of voltages high enough to measure resistance in the megohm range and thus construction of a first portable <b>insulation</b> <b>tester.</b> The MEGaohm metER was then named as Megger and the word became a trademark name registered on 25 May 1903.|$|E
50|$|Other test {{equipment}} includes a line <b>insulation</b> <b>tester</b> and an automatic trunk tester, for items whose numerosity and simplicity lent themselves to automatic testing. An automated AMA translator tester checked for miswiring that could bill one line to another. A nonautomated outgoing trunk test panel allows voltmeter checks on trunks to distant offices, freeing the MTF from this tedious job. Each outgoing trunk {{is represented by}} two jacks: one for test access for the voltmeter {{and one for the}} make-busy operation. MTF was able to override Make Busy when necessary.|$|E
40|$|The {{system and}} method for testing thermal {{insulation}} uses a cryostatic <b>insulation</b> <b>tester</b> having a vacuum chamber {{and a cold}} mass including a test chamber and upper and lower guard chambers adjacent thereto. The thermal insulation is positioned within the vacuum chamber and adjacent the cold mass. Cryogenic liquid is supplied to the test chamber, upper guard and lower guard to create a first gas layer in an upper portion of the lower guard chamber and a second gas layer in an upper portion of the test chamber. Temperature are sensed within the vacuum chamber to test the thermal insulation...|$|E
5000|$|The first ohmmeters {{were based}} on a type of meter {{movement}} known as a 'ratiometer'. [...] These were similar to the galvanometer type movement encountered in later instruments, but instead of hairsprings to supply a restoring force they used conducting 'ligaments'. These provided no net rotational force to the movement. Also, the movement was wound with two coils. One was connected via a series resistor to the battery supply. The second was connected to the same battery supply via a second resistor and the resistor under test. The indication on the meter was proportional to the ratio of the currents through the two coils. This ratio was determined by the magnitude of the resistor under test. The advantages of this arrangement were twofold. First, the indication of the resistance was completely independent of the battery voltage (as long as it actually produced some voltage) and no zero adjustment was required. Second, although the resistance scale was non linear, the scale remained correct over the full deflection range. By interchanging the two coils a second range was provided. This scale was reversed compared to the first. A feature of this type of instrument was that it would continue to indicate a random resistance value once the test leads were disconnected (the action of which disconnected the battery from the movement). Ohmmeters of this type only ever measured resistance as they could not easily be incorporated into a multimeter design. <b>Insulation</b> <b>testers</b> that relied on a hand cranked generator operated on the same principle. This ensured that the indication was wholly independent of the voltage actually produced.|$|R
40|$|The {{electric}} conductivity of a leaf (LEC) was determined with an <b>insulation</b> resistance <b>tester,</b> and discussed {{its relationship with}} Na[+] content in a leaf (LNC) and the photosynthetic activity in salt-stressed rice cultivars. The measurements were carried out using three cultivars of O. sativa and O. glaberrima grown at the middle vegative growth stage. The plants showed a clear response to the salt treatment wothin 24 hours after its application. Both LEC and LNC in these cultivars increased {{with an increase in}} NaCl concentration in culture solution from 0 to 0. 1 Î¼mol L[- 1]. LEC had a close linear relationship with LNC in each cultivar. A negative relationship was found between LEC and gross photosynthetic rate(Pg). The stomatal concuctance (Gs) and mesophyll conduntance (Gm) decreased with an increase in LNC. A clear cultivaral dofference was recognized in responces to salt treatments. LEC was regarded as a useful indicator for the estimation or diagnosis of LNC and photosynthetic activity in salt-stressed rice cultivars...|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} formal portable appliance {{testing and}} inspection of both electrical installations and high risk equipment {{was introduced in the}} UK in government estates. This was {{under the control of the}} Property Services Agency - prior to 1972 the Ministry of Public Building and Works. In some cases testing was conducted on a three-month (high-risk) and six-month (low-risk) cycle from the early 1960s onwards. Extensive record-keeping was made into log-books and generally the equipment used was an <b>insulation</b> resistance <b>tester,</b> simple hand tools and visual inspection. Evidence of testing was clearly visible to workers in the form of [...] "passed", [...] "tested for electrical safety" [...] and [...] "do not use after..." [...] labels affixed to various parts of the electrical equipment used. This early {{testing and inspection}} was done under a planned maintenance scheme and pre-dated both the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and the Electricity at Work Act 1989.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The violent {{event of}} a {{short-circuit}} leads to short-term exposure of circuit breaker components to extremely high current, causing thermal degradation, vaporization and deformation of some components and the deposition of surface contaminants. After short-circuit, the leakage current carried by the breaker, when voltage is applied, increases dramatically but must remain below a certain threshold to meet acceptance criteria. The goal {{of this study is}} to identify the primary leakage current pathways through the breaker following short-circuit and to elucidate the role of a protective coating, loaded with naturally-occurring clay nanoparticles, on improving the electrical performance of the breaker. A Megger <b>insulation</b> <b>tester</b> was used to test both virgin and short-circuited polycarbonate (PC) samples taken from the base of the circuit breaker. Further, direct-current and alternating-current conductivity were measured on PC samples by using a Keithley high-resistance meter and broadband dielectric spectroscopy, respectively. These tests established that the leakage current pathway is primarily through the surface contaminants deposited on the PC during the short-circuit event. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were employed to identify the composition and distribution of the surface contaminants. These were found to contain significant amounts of metal, accounting for the observed increase in leakage current through the breaker following short-circuit. The protective coating was studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, SEM and EDS, revealing the critical role played by insulating nanoclay in improving dielectric performance of a circuit breaker after short-circuit...|$|E
