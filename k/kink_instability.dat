40|$|We {{present a}} {{numerical}} study in resistive magnetohydrodynamics where the initial equilibrium configuration contains adjacent, oppositely directed, parallel current channels. Since oppositely directed current channels repel, the equilibrium {{is liable to}} an ideal magnetohydrodynamic tilt instability. This tilt evolution, previously studied in planar settings, involves two magnetic islands or fluxropes, which on Alfvenic timescales undergo a combined rotation and separation. This in turn leads {{to the creation of}} (near) singular current layers, posing severe challenges to numerical approaches. Using our open-source grid-adaptive MPI-AMRVAC software, we revisit the planar evolution case in compressible MHD, as well as its extension to 2. 5 D and full 3 D scenarios. As long as the third dimension remains ignorable, pure tilt evolutions result which are hardly affected by out of plane magnetic field components. In all 2. 5 D runs, our simulations do show secondary tearing type disruptions throughout the near singular current sheets in the far nonlinear saturation regime. In full 3 D, both current channels can be liable to additional ideal kink deformations. We discuss the effects of having both tilt and <b>kink</b> <b>instabilities</b> acting simultaneously in the violent, reconnection dominated evolution. In 3 D, both the tilt and the <b>kink</b> <b>instabilities</b> can be stabilized by tension forces. As a concrete space plasma application, we argue that interacting tilt-kink instabilities in repelling current channels provide a novel route to initiate solar coronal mass ejections, distinctly different from currently favored pure <b>kink</b> or torus <b>instability</b> routes.

5000|$|A <b>kink</b> <b>instability,</b> also {{oscillation}} or mode, is the m=1 {{class of}} magnetohydrodynamic instabilities which sometimes develop {{in a thin}} plasma column carrying a strong axial current. If a [...] "kink" [...] begins to develop in a column the magnetic forces {{on the inside of}} the kink become larger than those on the outside, which leads to growth of the perturbation. As it develops at fixed areas in the plasma, kinks belong to the class of [...] "absolute plasma instabilities", as opposed to convective processes.

5000|$|One early {{suggestion}} {{to solve the}} <b>kink</b> <b>instability</b> was to use highly conductive metal tubes for the vacuum chamber instead of glass.

The 3 D MHD numerical simulations are performed using Lare 3 d to model the <b>kink</b> <b>instability</b> and the subsequent wave generation. The initial conditions are a straight, zero net current flux tube containing a twist higher than the <b>kink</b> <b>instability</b> threshold. Results. It is shown that the <b>kink</b> <b>instability</b> initially sets up a 1 st harmonic (1 st overtone) that is converted through the rearrangement of the magnetic field into two out-of-phase fundamental slow modes.

The long-lived oscillations established after a <b>kink</b> <b>instability</b> provide a possible way to identify whether sudden, short coronal loop brightenings may have resulted from a confined <b>kink</b> <b>instability.</b> The mode oscillation structure changes from the 1 st harmonic to fundamental due to field line relaxation.

40|$|We present {{large scale}} 3 D particle-in-cell (PIC) {{simulations}} to examine particle energization in magnetic reconnection of relativistic electron-positron (pair) plasmas.

Contrary to the non-relativistic limit, the linear tearing instability is faster than the linear <b>kink</b> <b>instability,</b> at least in our specific parameters. We find that the magnetic energy dissipation is first facilitated by the tearing instability and followed by the secondary <b>kink</b> <b>instability.</b> Particles are mostly energized inside the magnetic islands during the tearing stage due to the spatially varying electric fields produced by the outflows from reconnection.

Consequently, different spectral lines are activated with and without the inclusion of thermal conduction, which have consequences for observations of solar corona loops. The conduction process is also important on the timescale of the fast magnetohydrodynamic phenomena. It reduces the kinetic energy released by an order of magnitude. Conclusions.

In {{order to understand}} how the equilibrium loop properties affect nonlinear evolution, various different initial magnetic equilibria are considered.

However, the corresponding electric current structure depends sensitively on the initial equilibrium: the initial magnetic twist profile, the loop length, {{and the nature of the}} outer potential region. If there are resonant regions at the loop apex where the radial component of the linear perturbed magnetic field vanishes, a current concentration develops there in the subsequent non linear phase.

The stability analysis of these equilibria predicts patterns of instability induced eddy currents for a model wall that is continuous and perfectly conducting, and these patterns are in good agreement with the ones observed on the HBT-EP segmented wall.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} has been to carry out 3 D MHD {{simulations}} to investigate nonlinear MHD instabilities and the behaviour of solar coronal loops. The simulations {{have been carried out}} on a parallel computer using a new shock-capturing Lagrangian-remap code, LareSd. As part of the PhD this code has been extended to include resistivity allowing the study of the non-linear resistive evolution of the instability. In particular the <b>kink</b> <b>instability</b> in line-tied coronal loops has been studied. This was suggested as a possible explanation of compact loop flares, sudden brightenings of a coronal loop due to a release of energy which does not destroy the loop. For the <b>kink</b> <b>instability</b> to explain such flares it must drive reconnection. This requires high current densities, i. e. current sheets. The results presented in this thesis suggest that the formation of current sheets during the non-linear evolution of the <b>kink</b> <b>instability</b> is more complicated than was previously believed. Indeed, if the loop is allowed to evolve slowly until the instability is triggered than the current appears to saturate at a finite value. This suggests that the <b>kink</b> <b>instability</b> cannot explain a compact loop flare.

40|$|Kink instabilities {{are likely}} to occur in the {{current-carrying}} magnetized plasma jets. Recent observations of the blazar radiation and polarization signatures suggest that the blazar emission region may be considerably magnetized. While the <b>kink</b> <b>instability</b> has been studied with first-principle magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, the corresponding time-dependent radiation and polarization signatures have not been investigated. In this paper, we perform comprehensive polarization-dependent radiation modeling of the <b>kink</b> <b>instability</b> in the blazar emission region based on relativistic MHD (RMHD) simulations. We find that the <b>kink</b> <b>instability</b> may give rise to strong flares with polarization angle (PA) swings or weak flares with polarization fluctuations, depending on the initial magnetic topology and magnetization. These findings are consistent with observations. Compared with the shock model, the kink model generates polarization signatures that are in better agreement with the general polarization observations. Therefore, we suggest that kink instabilities may widely exist in the jet environment, and provide an efficient way to convert the magnetic energy and produce multiwavelength flares and polarization variations.

In our simulations the CD <b>kink</b> <b>instability</b> is excited by a small initial velocity perturbation and develops turbulent structure inside the hot plasma column. We demonstrate that, as envisioned by Begelman, the hoop stress declines and the initial gas pressure excess near the axis decreases. The magnetization parameter œÉ, the ratio of the Poynting to the kinetic energy flux, declines from an initial value of 0. 3 to about 0. 01 when the CD <b>kink</b> <b>instability</b> saturates. Our simulations demonstrate that axisymmetric models strongly overestimate the elongation of the pulsar wind nebulae. Therefore, the previous requirement for an extremely low pulsar wind magnetization can be abandoned. The observed structure of the pulsar wind nebulae do not contradict the natural assumption that the magnetic energy flux still remains a good fraction of the total energy flux after dissipation of alternating fields.
