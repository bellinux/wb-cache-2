5|$|The dense, bow-like {{lamellae}} are pale-orange to pale-ochre {{and on the}} stipe basifixed {{or slightly}} decurrent. They are brittle and intermixed with shorter lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap margin to the stem) as well as partly <b>forking</b> near the stem. In old age or in cases of injury they receive initially dark red, later grey green spots. The spore print is pale ochre.|$|E
5|$|Lambeosaurus, {{best known}} through L. lambei, was {{quite similar to}} Corythosaurus in {{everything}} but {{the form of the}} head adornment. Compared to Corythosaurus, the crest of Lambeosaurus was shifted forward, and the hollow nasal passages within were {{at the front of the}} crest and stacked vertically. It also can be differentiated from Corythosaurus by its lack of <b>forking</b> nasal processes making up part of the sides of the crest, which is the only way to tell juveniles of the two genera apart, as the crests took on their distinctive forms as the animals aged.|$|E
5|$|All {{the veins}} {{of the wing}} are subject to {{secondary}} <b>forking</b> and to union by cross-veins. In some orders of insects the cross-veins are so numerous that the whole venational pattern becomes a close network of branching veins and cross-veins. Ordinarily, however, there is a definite number of cross-veins having specific locations. The more constant cross-veins are the humeral cross-vein (h) between costa and subcosta, the radial cross-vein (r) between R and the first fork of Rs, the sectorial cross-vein (s) between the two forks of R8, the median cross-vein (m–m) between M2 and M3, and the mediocubital cross-vein (m-cu) between media and cubitus.|$|E

50|$|The 6.9 mi Middle <b>Fork</b> {{is formed}} by the {{confluence}} of the short South <b>Fork</b> Middle <b>Fork</b> Tule River and the North <b>Fork</b> Middle <b>Fork</b> Tule River. The South <b>Fork</b> flows northwest and west, paralleling California State Route 190, from its headwaters near Camp Nelson.

5|$|The Cleveland Railway, the M and the S {{were all}} taken over in 1865 by the North Eastern Railway (NER). The new {{management}} authorised {{the construction of}} a link from Saltburn (which the S had reached in 1861) via Skelton to the Cleveland Railway's route at Brotton, <b>forking</b> south to reach Guisborough. This connection, completed in 1872, provided a new connection between Teesside and the East Cleveland mines, running north of the Eston Hills. Further capacity was provided by doubling the tracks on the line running east of Guisborough. This made the former Cleveland Railway's line west of Guisborough redundant and it was closed in 1873 after only twelve years of service, though the parallel MG line to Middlesbrough remained open for a further 90 years.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{passes the}} American Real Estate School and a campus of Empire State College before {{intersecting}} NY454 (Veterans Highway). Not far from NY454, NY111 has a short concurrency with CR76 (Townline Road) along the Islip–Smithtown {{and then the}} names changes to Hauppauge Road town line before fully crossing into Smithtown. After <b>forking</b> from CR76, NY111 continues northeast through the hamlet of Hauppauge, crossing NY347 (Smithtown Bypass) at-grade as it runs across another residential stretch. The route soon enters Village of the Branch, where it bends northward into a large commercial area {{at the center of}} the community. Here, NY111 intersects with East Main Street, which enters the junction from the west as NY25 and NY25A. At this point, NY25 continues eastward as Middle Country Road, NY111 terminates, and NY25A turns northward on NY111's right-of-way, changing names to North Country Road.|$|E
