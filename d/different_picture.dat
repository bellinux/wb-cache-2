5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s two men began to {{assemble}} a very <b>different</b> <b>picture</b> of Hubbard's life. Michael Linn Shannon, a resident of Portland, Oregon, became interested in Hubbard's life story after an encounter with a Scientology recruiter. Over {{the next four years}} he collected previously undisclosed records and documents. He intended to write an exposé of Hubbard and sent a copy of his findings and key records to a number of contacts but was unable to find a publisher.|$|E

Whilst Summer and bank {{holidays}} saw some patronage of the line - an excursion train from London ran three days each week, with extra trains on Sundays and bank holidays, Winter presented a <b>different</b> <b>picture</b> with trains continuing beyond Sharnal Street being almost completely empty.|$|E
25|$|Southeast Asia {{presents}} a <b>different</b> <b>picture</b> entirely, with women basically {{on a par}} with men in some countries: they make up 52% of researchers in the Philippines and Thailand, for example. Other countries are close to parity, such as Malaysia and Viet Nam, whereas Indonesia and Singapore are still around the 30% mark. Cambodia trails its neighbours at 20%. Female researchers in the region are spread fairly equally across the sectors of participation, {{with the exception of the}} private sector, where they make up 30% or less of researchers in most countries.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} {{source for the}} history of the Sueves during the initial settlement phase is the Seven Books of History Against the Pagans, by Orosius, another local historian. He depicted a very <b>different</b> <b>picture</b> of the initial settlement of Sueves and Vandals, less catastrophic than that narrated by Hydatius. In his narration, Sueves and Vandals, after a violent entrance in Hispanis, resume a pacific life of peasants and guardians, while many poor locals united to them, fleeing from Roman taxes and impositions. But, as has been pointed out, his narration is also biased by his agenda, as in his book he was trying to exculpate Christianity of the fall and decadence of Rome.|$|E

25|$|The {{other major}} work that Jonson wrote about Boulstred was his “Epitaph on Cecilia Bulstrode,” written in {{response}} to her death. This poem paints a very <b>different</b> <b>picture</b> of Boulstred than that of his epigram. In fact, it seems to retract each of the charges made in the first point by point. Jonson calls her a virgin, teacher to Pallas and Cynthia, conscientious, and good, vastly different from his epigram. The reason behind Jonson’s supposed change of heart is unknown. The likely reason is {{that he wanted to}} gain the favor of Lucy Russell, which he had been attempting to do for years. However, another explanation could be that he experienced true regret for his slanderous words after hearing of her painful death.|$|E
25|$|Once again, ancient authors paint a <b>different</b> <b>picture</b> of {{the events}} {{presented}} in the Cancelleria Reliefs. According to both Tacitus and Suetonius, Domitian's conduct during Mucianus' interim government was less than satisfactory; they allege he was over-zealous in distributing political offices, and eager to partake in unwarranted military campaigns. The chief motivation for Vespasian's return then, was the need to restrain Domitian. The literary evidence of this time must be treated with caution however, as Tacitus {{is known to have}} been heavily biased against Domitian. If, on the other hand, the Cancelleria Reliefs were indeed propaganda, they may have been intended to dispel popular rumours regarding the future emperor's conduct. Either interpretation cannot be established with certainty, although Jones favours a straightforward account in which Vespasian's reconciliation with Domitian was indeed amicable.|$|E
25|$|The {{first player}} moves {{the number of}} spaces along the track {{according}} to a dial spin. If the player lands on a pink star, his turn ends. If he lands on a yellow star, he draws a card and follows its instruction. If he draws a picture card, he retains it face down at his place. If a player spins a six, he is given the choice of moving six spaces or taking a magic wand. He may play the wand {{at any time during}} the game and in doing so draws two cards, following their instructions. A player must hold three <b>different</b> <b>picture</b> cards before entering the Path of Happiness. If he does not hold three picture cards, he continues around the Deep Sleep circle until he acquires the required three picture cards. Should a player land on a purple Maleficent space, that player returns one of his picture cards to the deck.|$|E

25|$|When Allen read Robert Daley's book, Prince of the City (1978), she was {{convinced}} it was a Sidney Lumet project, but the film rights had already been sold to Orion Pictures for Brian De Palma and David Rabe. Allen {{let it be known}} that if that deal should fall through, then she wanted the picture for Sidney. Just as Lumet was about to sign for a <b>different</b> <b>picture,</b> they got the call that Prince of the City was theirs. Allen hadn't wanted to write Prince of the City, just produce it. She was put off by the book's non-linear story structure, but Lumet wouldn't make the picture without her and agreed to write the outline for her. Lumet and Allen went over the book and agreed on what they could use and what they could do without. To her horror, Lumet would come in every day for weeks and scribble on legal pads. She was terrified that she would have to tell him that his stuff was unusable, but to her delight the outline was wonderful and she went to work. It was her first project with living subjects, and Allen interviewed nearly everyone in the book and had endless hours of Bob Leuci's tapes for back-up. With all her research and Lumet's outline, she eventually turned out a 365-page script in 10 days. It was nearly impossible to sell the studio on a three-hour picture, but by offering to slash the budget to $10 million they agreed.|$|E

500|$|In 1972, {{at the age}} of 53, Salinger had a {{relationship}} with 18-year-old Joyce Maynard that lasted for nine months. Maynard, at this time, was already an experienced writer for Seventeen magazine. The New York Times had asked Maynard to write an article for them which, when published as [...] "An Eighteen-Year-Old Looks Back On Life" [...] on April 23, 1972, made her a celebrity. Salinger wrote a letter to her warning about living with fame. After exchanging 25 letters, Maynard moved in with Salinger the summer after her freshman year at Yale University. Maynard did not return to Yale that fall, and spent ten months as a guest in Salinger's Cornish home. The relationship ended, he told his daughter Margaret at a family outing, because Maynard wanted children, and he felt he was too old. Nevertheless, in her own autobiography, Maynard paints a <b>different</b> <b>picture,</b> saying Salinger abruptly ended the relationship and refused to take her back. She had dropped out of Yale to be with him, even forgoing a scholarship. Maynard later writes in her own memoir how she came to find out that Salinger had begun relationships with young women by exchanging letters. One of those letter recipients included Salinger's last wife, a nurse who was already engaged to be married to someone else when she met the author.|$|E
500|$|Writer John Swartzwelder {{has noted}} that the staff members of the show write the {{character}} Homer {{in the same way}} that they write Santa's Little Helper: [...] "Both are loyal. Both have the same emotional range. And both will growl and possibly snap if you try to take their food." [...] Although animals in cartoons often behave with [...] "semi-human awareness", Groening said on the DVD audio commentary for the episode [...] "Two Dozen and One Greyhounds" [...] that he prefers animals in cartoons to behave exactly the way they do in real life. As a result, Santa's Little Helper is depicted in this way on the show. There have, however, been some exceptions for gags, but most of the time the staff of The Simpsons tries to keep animals acting realistically. Several journalists have commented on the greyhound's lack of intelligence. In an article that compared The Simpsons to the animated series Family Guy, Todd Camp of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram noted that [...] "though Santa's Little Helper may be the only Simpson who's dumber than Homer, the Griffins' pooch [...] is the brainiest member of the household". In 1991, Copley News Service's Alison Ashton described Santa's Little Helper as a [...] "sweet and stupid dog". Tom Coombe of The Morning Call wrote in 2002 that [...] "fans of The Simpsons will tell you that the cartoon family's dog [...] is often dumb, disobedient and skittish. Fans of the real-life breed will paint a <b>different</b> <b>picture</b> — of dogs that are peaceful, affectionate, [...] not given to drooling, panting".|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} a new argument against A-theories of time. A-theorists hold {{that there is}} an objective now (present moment) and an objective flow of time, the latter constituted by the movement of the objective now through time. A-theorists therefore want to draw <b>different</b> <b>pictures</b> of reality—showing the objective now in different positions—depending upon the time at which the picture is drawn. In this paper it is argued that the times at which the <b>different</b> <b>pictures</b> are drawn may be taken to be normal times or hypertimes. If they are normal times then the A-theory is inconsistent, or else collapses to the B-theory—and appealing to primitive tense operators will not help A-theorists avoid this conclusion. If the times are hypertimes then the A-theory is consistent, but deeply problematic none the less...|$|R
