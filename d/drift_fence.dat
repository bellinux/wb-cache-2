40|$|The western red-tailed skink (Eumeces gilberti rubricaudatus) is a {{sensitive}} species {{that is on}} the Nevada Natural Heritage Program’s “Animal and Plant At-Risk Tracking List. ” Information about this species is lacking, especially for southern Nevada. A pilot project was initiated in 2006 on portions of the Nevada Test Site (NTS) to (1) develop techniques for determining western red-tailed skink distribution, (2) determine if skinks are still present at historic locations, (3) evaluate habitat use by trapping in a variety of habitats, and (4) collect tissue samples for genetic analysis. Skink capture success was compared in trap arrays with and without <b>drift</b> <b>fences.</b> A total of 9 western red-tailed skinks were captured in 6, 092 trap days (0. 1 %, 1 skink/ 677 trap days). No skinks were captured in trap arrays with <b>drift</b> <b>fences,</b> which suggests that funnel traps set near rocks or vegetation without <b>drift</b> <b>fences</b> is a viable technique for capturing skinks. This greatly reduces the effort and cost to capture skinks. Skinks were captured at one of the three historic locations. Captures occurred in a variety of habitats including springs, ephemeral washes, and dry rocky areas. Genetic analysis revealed that NTS skinks are part of the Inyo clade, and are most closely related to skinks from slightly further north in Esmeralda County, Nevada, and west into the Panamint and Inyo/White Mountains in California.

50|$|The Burmese python {{system also}} poses {{challenges}} to trapping efforts. Trapping, a traditional method of snake capture, can include both {{the use of}} a device with an inescapable funnel and a <b>drift</b> <b>fence</b> that directs snake movement towards the trap. It is crucial that drift fences are inserted several inches into the ground {{in order to ensure that}} snakes cannot bypass them, but the hard limestone foundation of the area would make construction of adequate drift fences difficult. Additionally, a python moves infrequently because of its predation habits and thus, it is less likely to crawl into a trap. Finally, the immense area occupied by the Burmese python undermines the utility of extensive trapping. Trapping could be practical on a smaller scale if critical areas were targeted.|$|E
50|$|Tree frogs can {{be caught}} and photographed by using PVC pipes that are capped {{on the bottom}} and hung {{vertically}} in a tree near water.If aquatic species are the target species the use of an aquatic funnel trap can be used.Drift fences have been used with a high success rate for capturing snakes. The use of a drift fences along with a pit-fall or funnel box trap has yielded high success. The length of the fence is variable, but the longer the fence results in a higher success rate. The fence is set with traps in the middle and/or the ends. Snakes encounter the fence and are directed or lead to the trap. Care must be taken in providing enough cover so the species do not die of heat exhaustion. Identifying all the species in the trap is recommended so an accidental envenomation is avoided. Pit fall traps are small buckets that are placed in holes dug out next to the <b>drift</b> <b>fence.</b>|$|E
30|$|We {{surveyed}} all plots {{using an}} array of seven pitfall traps, three funnel traps, and 18 Sherman live-traps. For the pitfall trap array, we buried seven 19 L buckets flush with the ground and connected them using shade cloth <b>drift</b> <b>fence.</b> These arrays formed a “Y” shape, with each arm being approximately 15 m long and the buckets buried 7.5 m apart as described by Fisher et al. (2008). We placed one funnel trap along each arm between the two outer buckets (Fisher et al. 2008). We then placed nine pairs of Sherman live-traps approximately 1 m and 16 m from the center bucket between each arm of the <b>drift</b> <b>fence</b> and approximately 9 m from the center bucket along each arm of the <b>drift</b> <b>fence.</b> Each pair was composed of one Sherman XLK trap (8 cm × 9 cm × 30.5 cm) and one larger Sherman XLF 15 trap (10 cm × 11.5 cm × 38 cm). We left pitfall and funnel traps unbaited as passive traps for mammals, and baited Sherman traps with steam-rolled oats. We placed raised bucket lids over the pitfall traps and wood roof tiles over the funnel and Sherman traps to provide daytime shading and cover for captured animals. We placed a baseball sized piece of polyester batting {{in all of the}} trap types to insulate captured animals from colder nighttime temperatures. For each session, we sampled traps each morning for four consecutive days. Including all trap types, our sampling effort totaled 168 trap-nights per array before the fire and 336 trap-nights per array after the fire.|$|E
30|$|Anuran {{activity}} {{was divided into}} two types: (1) general activity and (2) calling activity. These forms of activity were evaluated using the following two methods: general {{activity was}} evaluated {{in terms of the}} capture rate in pitfall traps with <b>drift</b> <b>fences</b> (Greenberg et al. 1994), and calling activity was evaluated through calling surveys. The capture rate in this study was considered an indicator of general activity. General activity corresponded to any activity by the animals {{on the surface of the}} substrate (e.g., foraging, habitat exploration, searching for partners, and migration) and increased the probability of capture. Because these methods are common in herpetology, they will be described only briefly in this paper.|$|R

40|$|AbstractBiodiversity {{inventories}} {{are well}} acknowledged as key to conservation planning. One widely used method for sampling terrestrial fauna is traps with drift fences. Such drift fences, however, may be configured in several arrays, varying the height, {{length of the}} fence, space between conjugated traps (e. g., buckets or funnels), {{and it can be}} arranged in linear (I) or radial (Y) formats. Consequently, some criticism arose questioning which <b>drift</b> <b>fence</b> arrangement should be employed. Therefore, we made use of geometrical models to test the probability of capturing terrestrial tetrapods (as model organisms) using traps associated along with both I and Y <b>drift</b> <b>fence</b> arrays. With distances varying from 8 to 100 m from the fence, the capturing rate of the I format was in average 1. 16 times higher than the Y format. Besides this, we also present data that may enable field ecologists to better decide the minimum distance between two traps with drift fences, ensuring accurate statistics.

Taxonomic groups (anurans, salamanders, and squamates) were appraised for heterogeneity of susceptibility to capture among different methods. Also, capture success for types of funnel traps were compared across different size classes of squamates. We sampled a total of 91 days during six trapping periods over {{the spring and summer}} months of 1993 and 1994. Eight-hundred eighty-six individuals representing 38 species of reptiles and amphibians were captured. Standardizing captures by common unit effort (captures/trap-day or captures/person-day) shows that time-constrained searching was overall the most efficient, followed by <b>drift</b> <b>fence</b> arrays, then stand-alone funnel traps. However, more herps can be captured by trapping (especially when associated with drift fences) than searching, because of personnel limitations.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of pitfall traps associated with drift fences to capture {{amphibians and reptiles}} in three field studies, in Rio Grande do Sul (extreme southern Brazil), São Paulo (São Paulo, southeastern Brazil), and Amazonas (Amazonas, northern Brazil) is described.

At Itirapina, São Paulo, 1262 amphibians and reptiles were obtained in 72 pitfalls (100 L, with <b>drift</b> <b>fence)</b> during six months (capture efficiencies of 11, 9 amphibians and reptiles/pitfall/month and 0, 38 snake/pitfall/month). At Rio Pitinga, Amazonas, over 600 amphibians and reptiles were caught in 50 pitfalls (100 - 150 L, with <b>drift</b> <b>fence)</b> during three months (capture efficiencies of ca. 4. 00 amphibians and reptiles/pitfall/month and 0. 87 snake/pitfall/month). Capture efficiencies of 1. 25 to ~ 3. 92 amphibians and reptiles/pitfall/month were obtained in four other unpublished studies made by other authors in Brazil, all of them using 20 - 35 L traps, either with or without drift fences. Higher capture efficiencies for snakes were obtained in those studies in which larger containers (100 - 200 L) were used.
