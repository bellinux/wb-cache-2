5|$|After {{handling}} the marketing for Rentjong Atjeh (Rencong of Aceh, 1940), Andjar made his directorial debut in 1940 with Kartinah, a war-time romance starring Ratna Asmara. Academia {{was critical of}} the film, believing it to lack educational value. In 1941 he directed Noesa Penida, a tragedy based in Bali, for JIF; the film was remade in 1988. In these films, he had little creative control, and performed as what the Indonesian entertainment journalist Eddie Karsito <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> dialogue coach. Camera angles and locations were chosen by the cinematographer, who was generally also the producer.|$|E
5|$|Berndt Von Üxküll – Von Üxkül is a {{paraplegic}} junker from Pomerania and {{a composer}} {{who is married}} to Una. A World War I veteran, he fought alongside Aue's father in the Freikorps, whom he <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sadist. Despite essentially agreeing with their nationalist and antisemitic ideology, he distances himself from the Nazis. His name is possibly a reference to Nikolaus Graf von Üxküll-Gyllenband, an anti-Nazi resistant and uncle of Claus von Stauffenberg, a central figure in the failed plot to assassinate Hitler.|$|E
5|$|Having {{misunderstood}} {{the news}} about an upsurge of piracy in the Indian Ocean, Cartman excitedly tells his friends the classic era of piracy has returned, and asks the boys {{to join him in}} becoming a pirate in what he <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> responsibility-free life in a warm tropical paradise. Sensing an opportunity to get rid of Cartman once and for all, Kyle encourages him to go, even offering to help pay for his ticket. Although Butters, Ike, Clyde and Kevin are the only students who agree to join his crew, an undaunted Cartman uses his mother's credit card to book a trip to Somalia. After a long flight and a 49-hour bus ride, the boys arrive in Mogadishu dressed as stereotypical pirates. Once there, however, they are shocked to find themselves in a desolate land, the complete opposite of their expectations.|$|E

5|$|In 1874 Long {{chaired the}} state Republican convention, and finally won {{election}} to the state legislature. He formed {{a close relationship with}} Speaker John E. Sanford, and in what historian James Hess <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> probable move of political calculation, supported the successful gubernatorial candidate in 1875, Alexander H. Rice, even though Rice supported liberal legislation on alcohol sales that Long opposed. He was able to parlay this support into his own {{election to the}} speakership in 1876. He widened his reform views to the national stage by supporting Benjamin Bristow in his unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential nomination.|$|E
5|$|The interwar {{years were}} marked by {{economic}} stagnation in rural and urban areas, and high unemployment. Thoughtful Scots pondered their declension, as the main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term mass unemployment, pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a downward spiral. The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions. The despair reflected what Finlay (1994) <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> widespread sense of hopelessness that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Brundage {{hoped that}} the Munich Games would take {{the sting out of}} his defeat over the Rhodesian issue. Munich was one of his {{favorite}} cities, and the heitere Spiele (cheerful Games) were designed to efface memories of 1936 and Berlin {{in the eyes of the}} world. They initially seemed to be doing so, as athletic feats, like those of gymnast Olga Korbut and swimmer Mark Spitz captivated viewers. In the early morning of September 5, 1972, Palestinian terrorists from the organization Black September entered the Olympic Village and took 11Israelis hostage, demanding freedom for hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli custody. Brundage, once informed, rushed to the Olympic Village, where he conferred with German and Bavarian state officials through the day, playing what Guttmann <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> modest role in the discussions. German officials moved the hostages and their captors to Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base, where German police and troops tried a rescue late that evening. The attempt was bungled; the nine remaining hostages (two had been murdered earlier) and three of their captors were killed.|$|E

50|$|Rowledge {{was born}} in Peterborough, Northamptonshire in 1876, the son of John and Ann Rowledge. His father was <b>described</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{bricklayer}} in 1881. At {{the time of the}} 1891 census, Rowledge was <b>described</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> Apprentice to Engineers Draughtsman and in 1901 he was in Erith, Kent boarding at Rose Hill Villas, Bexley Road and <b>described</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Mechanical Draughtsman.|$|R
5|$|Dangić was {{released}} from prison in November 1918, at the end of World War I. The following year, he and Božo Ilić organized a series of communist demonstrations in Belgrade, for which they were arrested and imprisoned. Following his release, Dangić {{became a member of the}} League of Farmers, a political party that sought to protect the interests of the Bosnian Serb peasantry, and which the historian Marko Attila Hoare <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> precursor to the Chetnik movement in Bosnia and Herzegovina during World War II. Dangić also obtained a law degree and spent some time as a district officer in Belgrade, Subotica, Kratovo and Vlasenica. By 1928, he had achieved the rank of cavalry sub-lieutenant. He joined the gendarmerie on 3 January 1928, and worked his way up to the rank of major. Over the course of his gendarmerie service, he served in Skopje, Tuzla, Virovitica, and Zagreb. In 1940, he was appointed to lead the gendarmerie detachment stationed at the Yugoslav royal palace. He was married and had two daughters, born in 1931 and 1937.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} {{lines of the}} poem Dryden {{describes}} King Cinyras just as Ovid did {{as a man who}} had been happier if he had not become a father. Lee suggests that this is a direct parallel to James who could have been counted as happier if he had not had his daughter, Mary, who betrayed him and usurped his monarchical position. When describing the act of incest Dryden uses a monster metaphor. Those lines are suggested as aimed at William III who invaded England from the Netherlands and whose presence Dryden <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> curse or a punishment, according to Lee. A little further on the Convention Parliament is indicted. Lee suggests that Dryden critiques the intrusiveness of the Convention Parliament, because it acted without constituted legal authority. Finally the daughter, Mary as Myrrha, is described as an impious outcast from civilization, whose greatest sin was her disrupting the natural line of succession thereby breaking both natural as well as divine statutes which resulted in fundamental social confusion. When Myrrha craves and achieves her father's (Cinyras') bed, Lee sees a parallel to Mary's ascending James' throne: both daughters incestuously occupied the place which belonged to their fathers.|$|E
5|$|The {{shipbuilding}} industry {{expanded by}} a third and expected renewed prosperity, but instead a serious depression hit the economy by 1922 {{and it did not}} fully recover until 1939. The interwar years were marked by economic stagnation in rural and urban areas, and high unemployment. Indeed, the war brought with it deep social, cultural, economic, and political dislocations. Thoughtful Scots pondered their declension, as the main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term mass unemployment, pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a downward spiral. Service abroad on behalf of the Empire lost its allure to ambitious young people, who left Scotland permanently. The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions. The despair reflected what Finlay (1994) <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> widespread sense of hopelessness that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the Second World War.|$|E

5|$|Thorpe's {{interests}} in fashion and culture {{led him to}} make frequent visits to New York City—which he <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> second home—often for engagements with Armani and particularly because of the city's status as a global fashion capital. He {{was present at the}} World Trade Center on the morning of 11 September 2001, having stopped there on his jog, before returning to his hotel after forgetting his camera. It was during this trip that he appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, which was notable because of the relative lack of interest in competitive swimming in America. Thorpe later became a spokesperson for the unsuccessful New York bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, even promising to continue his career until the games if New York won the hosting rights. Thorpe's interests have also seen him involved in television. In 2002, he played the lead role in the reality television show Undercover Angels, which imitated the Charlie's Angels series. In the program, Thorpe directed three young women who performed good deeds for people in need. Although it averaged more than a million viewers per episode, it was widely panned by critics. Thorpe has also appeared as an extra in the American sitcom Friends.|$|E

25|$|Muslims {{believe that}} God {{revealed}} to Jesus a new scripture, al-Injīl (the Gospel), while also declaring {{the truth of}} the previous revelations: al-Tawrat (the Torah) and al-Zabur (the Psalms). The Quran speaks favorably of al-Injīl, which it <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> scripture that fills the hearts of its followers with meekness and piety. The Quran says that the original biblical message has been distorted or corrupted (tahrif) over time. In chapter 3, verse 3, and chapter 5, verses 46-47, of the Quran, the revelation of al-Injil is mentioned.|$|E

25|$|A boom {{was created}} by the First World War, with the {{shipbuilding}} industry expanding by a third, but a serious depression hit the economy by 1922.
