25|$|When the Emperor's power seemed broken {{after the}} African disaster, Francis I {{was far from}} reaping the {{benefits}} of an effort that ended up being rather costly, and he couldn't reply with the reputation he had acquired throughout Europe. The two monarchs Charles I of Spain and Francis I of France, used up {{the remainder of the}} year to prepare new campaigns. On the French part, Frances <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>everything</b> possible to obtain military support from the Ottoman Empire, persuading Suleiman the Magnificent to return to Hungary and attack Charles of Austria's possessions, while the Ottoman Admiral, Hayreddin Barbarossa, attacked the Spanish and Italian coasts.|$|E
500|$|Taylor's {{high-profile}} {{verbal and}} physical clashes with Huff were well-noted. [...] "He was always hooting his mouth {{off on the}} field," [...] Huff said of Taylor. [...] "He'd tell me, 'Yeah, you're just a big talker.' He brought the best out in you. He was an unusual player, a great player, but an agitator ... <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>everything</b> I could to that sonofabitch." [...] The 1962 championship game between the Packers and Giants featured hard hitting and skirmishes throughout by both players, after which Taylor acknowledged there were [...] "some hard feelings" [...] between the two. Boxing promoter Al Flora, after watching the game on television, offered Taylor and Huff $2,000 for a four-round boxing match {{to be held in}} Baltimore on January 28, 1963. His offer was turned down, however.|$|E
500|$|Tim's driving days {{started as}} a toddler when {{he was given a}} go-kart that he often drove inside {{buildings}} and across his lawn. He later raced the kart at tracks in Moreland and New Pittsburg. Richmond grew up in a well-to-do family, and was sometimes therefore treated differently by his classmates, so his parents enrolled him in Miami Military Academy in Miami, Florida. During his years in Miami, Tim and his mother moved to Florida and his father stayed in Ohio. While home in Ohio over a summer break, he met local drag racer Raymond Beadle through lifelong friend Fred Miller. When Richmond reached age 16, his parents purchased him a Pontiac Trans Am, a speedboat and a Piper Cherokee airplane for his birthday. Yet his mother Evelyn often worried about spoiling her only son. She once said, [...] "Tim was lazy...", and [...] "... <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>everything</b> for him. I ruined him, I admit it. He was my whole life." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{soon as he}} {{achieved}} success he began polishing the Coward image: an early press photograph showed him {{sitting up in bed}} holding a cigarette holder: [...] "I looked like an advanced Chinese decadent in the last phases of dope." [...] Soon after that, Coward wrote, [...] "I took to wearing coloured turtle-necked jerseys, actually more for comfort than for effect, and soon I was informed by my evening paper that I had started a fashion. I believe that to a certain extent this was true; at any rate, during the ensuing months I noticed more and more of our seedier West-End chorus boys parading about London in them." [...] He soon became more cautious about overdoing the flamboyance, advising Cecil Beaton to tone down his outfits: [...] "It is important not to let the public have a loophole to lampoon you." [...] However, Coward was happy to generate publicity from his lifestyle. In 1969 he told Time magazine, [...] "I acted up like crazy. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>everything</b> that was expected of me. Part of the job." [...] Time concluded, [...] "Coward's greatest single gift has not been writing or composing, not acting or directing, but projecting a sense of personal style, a combination of cheek and chic, pose and poise." ...|$|E
500|$|Before the trial, Martin made a {{statement}} explaining that he killed Lowe in self-defence. He said he had fallen asleep after checking in, but woke up after someone touched his buttocks; it was Lowe, who was clad only in his underwear and smiling at him. To him, this behaviour made Lowe {{appear to be a}} homosexual, so he kicked Lowe away. This angered Lowe, who threw Martin's hammer at his stomach. Martin then grabbed the hammer and [...] "hit [...] several times on the head until he collapsed onto the carpeted floor." [...] A friend later helped him to dispose of Lowe's body by throwing it into the Singapore River. Martin continued, [...] "I am not sure what was the next thing <b>I</b> <b>did...</b> <b>everything</b> was such a blur to me after this incident that I was walking around in a dream world for the next few days." [...] He refused to identify his friend, saying, [...] "I cannot tell you his identity because if he knew he would harm my family back in Britain." [...] On 15 March, he flew to Phuket, where he met his friend again. His friend gave him the passports and other items belonging to the Damudes, whom he never met.|$|E
2500|$|Although Dandridge and Belafonte were singers, {{neither was}} capable of singing the operatic score, so Marilyn Horne and LeVern Hutcherson were hired to record their vocals, and soundtrack {{recording}} began on June 18. Horne later recalled, [...] "Even though I {{was at that time}} a very light lyric soprano, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>everything</b> I possibly could to imitate the voice of Dorothy Dandridge. I spent many hours with her. In fact, one of the reasons I was chosen to do this dubbing was that I was able to imitate her voice had she been able to sing in the proper register." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although the {{programme}} typically contains few non-trivial stunts or dramatic special effects, {{the first}} episode includes an example of Ash Morgan's favourite con, known as [...] "The Flop": having previously received a fractured skull in a bar brawl, Morgan deliberately steps in front of moving cars and exaggerates the accident. Although not actually hurt, X-ray scans show his fractured skull, and the driver's insurance company pays out a compensation claim. Glenister balked at doing the entire stunt himself, saying [...] "I got a stunt man who did all the smashing against the windscreen stunts but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>everything</b> else... We all like doing the stunts involving driving fast because it's boy's-own stuff {{but when it comes}} to the dangerous stunts I'm quite happy to leave it to someone else!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{began in}} late 1994, and proceeded midway through 1995 in RZA's basement studio in Staten Island, the same studio {{that many of}} the group's earlier albums were recorded in. In regard to Raekwon and Ghostface Killah's original recording intentions, RZA recounted [...] "They had wanted to go to Barbados. But when they got to Barbados, the racism was so crazy. It was on some slave mentality. The Blacks was being treated like shit. They stopped back, and everything was recorded in my basement. No engineer, no assistant engineer. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>everything</b> on that shit. The only two albums I did with nobody fucking with me was Linx and Liquid Swords. I was on a mission. To make all those early albums took {{three and a half years}} of my life. I didn't come outside, didn't have too many girl relations, didn't even enjoy the shit. I just stayed in the basement. Hours and hours and days and days. Turkey burgers and blunts. I didn't know if it was working. But nobody could hear or say nothing, no comments, no touching the board when I leave. Everything was just how I wanted it." [...] Regarding the recording atmosphere, Raekwon stated [...] "The way RZA had it poppin' back then, we would come into his spot. It was like dudes would come in on their own time and create stuff. I remember I just came in, and the beats was just pumpin'." ...|$|E
