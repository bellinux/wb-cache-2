40|$|Quantifying {{the various}} {{components}} of evapotranspiration during sprinkler irrigation {{is not only}} challenging but also difficult to measure and validate using traditional methods. In this paper, measurements of the varying rates of ET using precision energy budget/eddy covariance measurements and sapflow in cotton before, during and after sprinkler irrigation are reported. The trials were carried out at a small scale using small impact type sprinkler irrigation system. Nondimensionalisation of the measured ET and sapflow rates with respect to atmospheric evaporative demand permitted superposition and averaging of multiple time series of data {{for each of the}} three phases of irrigation. Significantly higher values of evaporation and reduced values of sapflow were measured during sprinkler irrigation of the cotton crop. The reason for the higher rate of evaporation during irrigation was identified as the evaporation of <b>intercepted</b> <b>water</b> on the canopy, which varied with crop canopy development, and possibly some droplet evaporation during flight. A decreasing rate of evaporation following irrigation represented drying of the residual <b>intercepted</b> <b>water</b> remaining on the canopy after irrigation. Sapflow measurements showed a considerable reduction in transpiration during irrigation and indicated that canopy evaporation is the dominant component of total evapotranspiration during sprinkler irrigation. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{estimation}} of soil moisture and crop biomass based on differential interferometry is {{questioned by the}} influence of intercepted rain (i. e., plant surface moisture) on repeat-pass observables. The magnitude, {{the origin of this}} effect, as well as its dependence on system and crop biophysical parameters have been only marginally addressed so far. This paper intends to investigate these aspects within the frame of a laboratory experiment carried out in a highly controlled electromagnetic environment. The collection of multifrequency and fully polarimetric scatterometer profiles offers a distinctive data set, which helps to understand the variations of the interferometric observables in response to a varying plant surface moisture. These changes are assessed by comparing the predictions of a first-order scattering solution with the impact found in the experimental data. Furthermore, the connection between plant surface moisture and differential interferometric observables (i. e., the magnitude and phase of the interferometric coherence) is empirically tested with the aid of regression techniques. Irrespective of frequency and polarization, <b>intercepted</b> <b>water</b> is found to impact the interferometric coherence in a similar way as changes in soil and/or plant water status, i. e., the increase of the sensor to target optical path. Changes of plant surface moisture might be erroneously mistaken either for soil water content or fresh biomass variations.

40|$|Cosmic-ray neutron probes {{are a new}} {{technology}} to monitor soil water content at an intermediate scale significant to land surface processes. This method relies on the negative correlation between near-surface fast neutron counts and soil moisture content since hydrogen atoms in the soil, which are mainly present as water, moderate the secondary neutrons {{on the way back}} to the surface. However, the application of this method is hampered by its susceptibility to additional sources of hydrogen (e. g. above- and belowground biomass, humidity of the lower atmosphere, lattice water of the soil minerals, organic matter and water in the litter layer, <b>intercepted</b> <b>water</b> in the canopy, and soil organic matter). In this study, we analysed the effects of changing above- and belowground biomass and <b>intercepted</b> <b>water</b> in the canopy on the cosmic-ray neutron counts and calibration parameters. For this, the agricultural field test site Selhausen was equipped with cosmic-ray neutron probes and the wireless sensor network SoilNet with 108 soil moisture sensors. In order to increase the sensitivity of the cosmic-ray neutron measurements, we assembled seven neutron detectors. In addition, we measured rainfall interception at two locations in the field. To monitor the changes in above- and belowground biomass of the winter wheat, roots and plants were sampled approximately every four weeks and LAI was measured weekly during the measurement campaign. Weekly biomass changes were derived by relating LAI to total biomass. As expected, we found an increasing discrepancy between cosmic-ray-derived and in-situ measured soil moisture during the growing season and a decrease in discrepancy after the harvest. In order to quantify the effect of hydrogen stored in the vegetation on fast neutron intensity, we derived a daily time series of the calibration parameter N 0 and a weekly moving window optimization for weekly values for the calibrated N 0 parameter. We found linear negative relationships between N 0 and total fresh biomass and N 0 and intercepted precipitation. Using these corrections, the discrepancy between cosmic-ray-derived and in-situ measured soil moisture could be reduced from a RMSE of 0. 0803 m³/m³ to 0. 0354 m³/m³...|$|R

40|$|Structure and {{function}} of terrestrial plant communities bring about intimate relations between water, energy, and carbon exchange between land surface and atmosphere. Total evaporation, which {{is the sum of}} transpiration, soil evaporation and evaporation of <b>intercepted</b> <b>water,</b> couples water and energy balance equations. The rate of transpiration, which is the major fraction of total evaporation over most of the terrestrial land surface, is linked to the rate of carbon accumulation because functioning of stomata is optimized by both of these processes. Thus, quantifying the spatial and temporal variations of the transpiration efficiency (which is defined as the ratio of the rate of carbon accumulation and transpiration), and water use efficiency (defined as the ratio of the rate of carbon accumulation and total evaporation), and evaluation of modeling results against observations, are of significant importance in developing a better understanding of land surface processes. An approach has been developed for quantifying spatial and temporal variations of transpiration, and water-use efficiency based on biophysical process-based models, satellite and field observations. Calculations have been done using concurrent meteorological data derived from satellite observations and four dimensional data assimilation for four consecutive years (1987 - 1990) over an agricultural area in the Northern Great Plains of the US, and compared with field observations within and outside the study area.

40|$|A {{model of}} the energy {{exchange}} between the atmosphere and a vegetated surface has been developed and used to investigate the sources of energy available for evaporation of precipitation intercepted by a forest canopy. Simulations with this model have demonstrated that a forest canopy wetted by rainfall will partition more of the absorbed radiant energy into latent heat exchange than an unwetted canopy in the same environment. This energy diversion creates a decrease in sensible heat transfer from the canopy to the atmosphere and a smaller decrease in a long-wave radiation emitted by the canopy. Although both evapotranspiration and the evaporation of intercepted precipitation are evaporative losses, they have generally been expressed as separate terms in. the hydrologic cycle because they {{were believed to be}} independent of each other.

The study is based on radiometric, meteorological, and biophysical measurements obtained during the SMOSREX Experiment (Toulouse, France). Several approaches were followed to evaluate interception effects. Firstly, the analysis of microwave brightness temperature (TB) measurements at L-band indicated that interception increases vegetation emission at both polarisations. Secondly, the use of microwave indices to detect the presence/absence of interception was examined. In particular, a modified polarisation ratio at 50 ° {{was found to be}} well related to the interception status of the standing vegetation. Finally, the vegetation optical depth (?), which parameterises the extinction across the vegetation layer, was retrieved from the TB observations.

The reason biomass production so strongly outclasses other water dependent processes, is that water is one key element involved in plant growth. Simultaneous with the photosynthesis process, when stomata in the foliage open to take in carbon dioxide, large amounts of water are being consumed as transpiration flow, and released as vapour from the plant canopy. Furthermore, this productive flow of vapour, is accompanied by non-productive evaporative losses of water (from soil, ponded <b>water,</b> and <b>intercepted</b> <b>water</b> from foliage surface).

40|$|Biomass {{production}} of annual crops is often {{directly proportional to}} the amounts of radiation <b>intercepted,</b> <b>water</b> transpired and nutrients taken up. In many places the amount of rainfall {{during the period of}} rapid crop growth is less than the potential rate of evaporation, so that depletion of stored soil water is commonplace. The rate of mineralization of nitrogen (N) from organic matter and the processes of nutrient loss are closely related to the availability of soil water. Results from Kenya indicate the rapid changes in nitrate availability following rain. Nutrient supply has a large effect on the quantity of radiation intercepted and hence, biomass production. There is considerable scope for encouraging canopy expansion to conserve water by reducing evaporation from the soil surface in environments where it is frequently rewetted, and where the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil is sufficient to supply water at the energy limited rate (e. g. northern Syria). In regions with high evaporative demand and coarse-textured soils (e. g. Niger), transpiration may be increased by management techniques that reduce drainage.
