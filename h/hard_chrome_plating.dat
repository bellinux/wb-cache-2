However, current and anticipated environmental regulations, together with concerns related to performance, are leading to the qualification of other types of coatings as replacements for chrome. Within the Department of Defense (DoD), <b>hard</b> <b>chrome</b> <b>plating</b> is widely used, with the total value of plating operations exceeding $ 100 million annually. In functional <b>hard</b> <b>chrome</b> <b>plating,</b> chromium deposits with thicknesses ranging from 2. 5 to 500 µm (0. 1 to 20 mils) are obtained from passing an electric current through a solution of chromic acid and a catalyst.

Vickers hardness values (300 g load) for chrome plating are generally in the range of 8. 5 to 10. 5 GPa. Hardness starts to decrease above 220 ˚C; consequently, chrome plating should not be used for wear resistance in applications where the service temperature exceeds 400 ˚C. <b>Hard</b> <b>chrome</b> <b>plating</b> utilizes chromium in the hexavalent state (hex-Cr), which is a known carcinogen...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{development}} of cutting forces during the hard turning of <b>hard</b> <b>chrome</b> <b>plated</b> surfaces on EN 24 substrate. The hard turning operation disproves the Merchant's theory of cutting force development during the machining as the hard turning {{is only a small}} stock material removal. Various forces produced such as cutting force, feed force and thrust force have been measured during the finish turning. The experimental results have indicated that the feed force is the predominant force out of three different forces developed. This is in good agreement with the available literature. The results obtained from the experimentation were used to predict the optimum cutting conditions in terms of cutting forces. The optimized cutting parameters are feed of 0. 08 mm/rev, cutting speed of 500 rpm and depth of cut of 40 jum. The developed mathematical model exhibited satisfactory goodness of the model fit in regression with different PcBN cutting tool inserts. A maximum of 5 % variation in the experimental results of the cutting forces when compared with the mathematical model has been observed. This suggests that the developed mathematical model could be employed to predict the cutting forces during hard turning of <b>hard</b> <b>chrome</b> <b>plated</b> surfaces...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: CrN coating, <b>hard</b> <b>chrome</b> <b>plating</b> and {{nitriding}} {{has been}} applied on commonly used thermoset plastic mould steel X 40 CrMoV 5 - 1 (Materials number 1. 2344). The effects of these surface treatments over wear behaviour, impact behaviour, hardness, tensile strength and corrosion behaviour experimentally investigated. Design/methodology/approach: Charpy test, tensile test, hardness measurements, wear tests, salt spray tests conducted over hard chrome plated, nitrided, CrN coated and uncoated X 40 CrMoV 5 - 1 specimens. Coating thickness and diffusion layers examined by Nikon Eclipse LV 150 optical microscope. Findings: Highest micro hardness was observed in CrN coating, which is followed by nitriding and <b>hard</b> <b>chrome</b> <b>plating.</b> In wear tests, highest wear resistance was observed in CrN coating, then nitriding. Hard chrome plated samples were exposed abrasion more than uncoated ones. CrN coating and <b>hard</b> <b>chrome</b> <b>plating</b> didn’t affect the yield and tensile strength of material but increased the modulus of elasticity. It is observed that, nitriding decreased the tensile strength but increased the modulus of elasticity. Decrease in impact energy, and increase in brittleness was observed in descending order of nitriding, CrN coating and <b>hard</b> <b>chrome</b> <b>plating.</b> Research limitations/implications: Tensile test machine with hydraulic jaws {{can be used in}} further researches.

50|$|<b>Chrome</b> <b>plating</b> is a {{finishing}} treatment using the electrolytic deposition of chromium. The {{most common form}} of <b>chrome</b> <b>plating</b> is the thin, decorative bright chrome, which is typically a 10-&#181;m layer over an underlying nickel plate. When plating on iron or steel, an underlying plating of copper allows the nickel to adhere. The pores (tiny holes) in the nickel and chromium layers work to alleviate stress caused by thermal expansion mismatch but also hurt the corrosion resistance of the coating. Corrosion resistance relies on what is called the passivation layer, which is determined by the chemical composition and processing, and is damaged by cracks and pores. In a special case, micropores can help distribute the electrochemical potential that accelerates galvanic corrosion between the layers of nickel and chromium. Depending on the application, coatings of different thicknesses will require different balances of the aforementioned properties. Thin, bright chrome imparts a mirror-like finish to items such as metal furniture frames and automotive trim. Thicker deposits, up to 1000&#160;µm, are called <b>hard</b> <b>chrome</b> and are used in industrial equipment to reduce friction and wear.|$|R

Electrochemical polarization tests and free corrosion tests were performed in 0. 1 M HCl aqueous solution; the corrodkote test (ASTM B 380 - 97 R 02) was also performed, to rank coatings qualitatively. The lowest corrosion current densities (Icorr) were recorded for EHC and Tribaloy- 700. The latter coating contained few secondary phases and little porosity; the damage was mainly due to corrosion activation along lamellae boundaries.
