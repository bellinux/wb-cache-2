5|$|A Jiva (being) {{immersed}} in Maya (changing reality, illusive world) craves for worldly greed, performs karoti (Sanskrit: करोति, ritual works), enjoys bodily pleasures like women, food, drink and pleasures. This, states the text, gives him satisfaction in his wakeful state, in dream as he sleeps his soul fashions a dream world of joys and nightmares, {{but this is}} all deception. True bliss, states the text, comes in the third state of consciousness. It is, states the text, the third state, <b>everything</b> <b>comes</b> to rest, in whole, in peace, in bliss.|$|E
25|$|According to Madhva, God, {{although}} He has control, {{does not}} interfere with Man's free will; although He is omnipotent, {{that does not mean}} that He engages in extraordinary feats. Rather, God enforces a rule of law and, in accordance with the just deserts of jivas, gives them freedom to follow their own nature. Thus, God functions as the sanctioner or as the divine accountant, and accordingly jivas are free to work according to their innate nature and their accumulated karma, good and bad. Since God acts as the sanctioner, the ultimate power for <b>everything</b> <b>comes</b> from God and the jiva only utilizes that power, according to his/her innate nature. However, like Shankara's interpretation of the Brahma Sutras as mentioned earlier, Madhva, agrees that the rewards and punishments bestowed by God are regulated by Him in accordance with the good and sinful deeds performed by them, and He does so of out of His own will to keep himself firm in justice and he cannot be controlled in His actions by karma of human beings nor can He be accused of partiality or cruelty to anyone.|$|E

I can't give too much away about the songs, but it's definitely going to represent the album because the album is very multilayered. It doesn't represent 'Your Body' as a single tone. It has its ballads; and <b>everything</b> <b>comes</b> from a very sincere, deeprooted place whether it's having fun or being vulnerable.|$|E

Adele's vocal range spans , from the low note of G3 to the high note of C5, on the song. The lyrics closely follow the narrative of the film {{rather than focusing on}} romanticism. According to Epworth, the song is about [...] "death and rebirth", saying [...] "It's like, when the world ends and <b>everything</b> <b>comes</b> down around your ears, if you've got each other's back, you can conquer anything. From death to triumph, that was definitely something we set out to try and capture". The Daily Telegraph writer Neil McCormick described the lyrics as [...] "slightly sinister" [...] and containing references to a number of Bond tropes and motifs.|$|E
500|$|Critics have {{compared}} Eliot to Yeats. Yeats believed {{that we live}} in a cyclical world, saying, [...] "If it be true that God is a circle whose centre is everywhere, the saint goes to the centre, the poet and the artist to the ring where <b>everything</b> <b>comes</b> round again." [...] Eliot believed that such a system is stuck within time. Eliot was influenced by Yeats's reading of Dante. This appears in Eliot's Ash-Wednesday by changing Yeats's [...] "desire for absolution" [...] away from a humanistic approach. When Eliot wrote about personal topics, he tended to use Dante as a reference point. He also relied on Dante's imagery: the idea of the [...] "refining fire" [...] in the Four Quartets and in The Waste Land comes from Purgatorio, and the celestial rose and fire imagery of Paradiso makes its way into the series.|$|E

He {{had joined the}} series during its second season, and had to quickly {{manufacture}} props while working under time and budget constraints. He explained, [...] " [...] first episode {{we had to make}} the shape-shifter device, the thing that you put into your mouth and it transforms one person into another person. I was brand new here and I wasn’t happy with the way that turned out, and it came back in about 5 or 6 episodes. Every time it came back I was like, ‘Oh, I wish I could have that time over again to redo this one." [...] He added, [...] "A lot of the time, I [...] actually see [...] on set, so I watched the episode to see how <b>everything</b> <b>comes</b> together." ...|$|E
500|$|Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode four stars {{out of four}} and called it [...] "one of those rare episodes where <b>everything</b> <b>comes</b> together—funny, bizarre, absurd, ironies, and sad." [...] She applauded Boyle's acting, noting that he [...] "gives a {{performance}} that simply takes over the TV screen", and argued that [...] "only actors as strong as Duchovny and Anderson, with their blissfully deadpan delivery, could withstand such a titanic presence, but withstand it they do." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a rare [...] "A+", writing, [...] "Boyle gets lots of help from another superlative, laugh-a-minute script [...] nicely captures one of the overarching themes of the show: fate and man's isolation." [...] Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode an [...] "A" [...] and wrote positively of the ending, writing that, [...] "for an episode that ends with a likable character killing himself, 'Bruckman' isn't what I'd call a downer." [...] He called the entry his [...] "favorite episode of The X-Files because it's funny, suspenseful, does well by Scully and Mulder, and creates some indelible characters." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{second part}} of the Memorial {{described}} suggestions for the social and political organization of Indian communities relative to colonial ones. Las Casas advocated the dismantlement of the city of Asunción and the subsequent gathering of Indians into communities of about 1,000 Indians to be situated as satellites of Spanish towns or mining areas. Here, Las Casas argued, Indians could be better governed, better taught and indoctrinated in the Christian faith, and would be easier to protect from abuse than if they were in scattered settlements. Each town would have a royal hospital built with four wings {{in the shape of a}} cross, where up to 200 sick Indians could be cared for at a time. He described in detail social arrangements, distribution of work, how provisions would be divided and even how table manners were to be introduced. Regarding expenses, he argued that [...] "this should not seem expensive or difficult, because after all, <b>everything</b> <b>comes</b> from them [...] and they work for it and it is theirs." [...] He even drew up a budget of each pueblo's expenses to cover wages for administrators, clerics, Bachelors of Latin, doctors, surgeons, pharmacists, advocates, ranchers, miners, muleteers, hospitalers, pig herders, fishermen, etc. He showed that this arrangement could easily be maintained and gold still be extracted at a profit.|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times {{described}} {{the film as}} being an [...] "extraordinary documentary," [...] and stated that the film was [...] "nothing at all like what" [...] he was expecting to see. Ebert dismissed reports that Jackson was in poor health and was underperforming, stating that the film did not show a [...] "sick and drugged man forcing himself through grueling rehearsals, but a spirit embodied by music" [...] and referred to Jackson's rehearsal performance(s) as having been [...] "something else." [...] Kirt Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter praised the film for being [...] "strange yet strangely beguiling" [...] for capturing Jackson in [...] "feverish grips of pure creativity" [...] and stated that while the film presents that audience with a screen filled with everyone ranging from [...] "performers, musicians, choreographers, crew members, craftsmen," [...] she took notice that the film had primarily focused on Jackson. Honeycutt perceived {{based on what he}} had seen from the behind-the-scenes look of rehearsals that he understood what it takes to [...] "attain such dizzying heights in entertainment" [...] and that he understood why Jackson [...] "chose to stay away" [...] from performing [...] "for a decade" [...] and, based on what he saw from footage from rehearsals that it [...] "looks like the world has missed one helluva concert." [...] Honeycutt cited that the only thing that frustrated him more than knowing the [...] "tragedy" [...] that prevented the concert from happening was [...] "not knowing what you're looking at" [...] and commented that the film did not feel like a complete concert film because it had a grip on the audience, stating: [...] "Where are Jackson and his conspirators at any given moment in the creative process? The film tries to be a concert film without having the actual footage. So when <b>everything</b> <b>comes</b> to a halt, audiences get thrown." [...] Peter Travers, of Rolling Stone described watching Jackson's [...] "struggle" [...] as being [...] "illuminating, unnerving and unforgettable" [...] and felt that the film was a great [...] "transcendent tribute" [...] to Jackson because it did not have, nor need, a [...] "safety net." ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said that it [...] "contains some superb touching character scenes between Homer and Lisa, a fascinating glimpse of Marge's insecurities, and some nice touches that take it above the show's very high average." [...] Dave Foster of DVD Times said that [...] "Bart on the Road" [...] is an episode which is built upon a [...] "frankly ludicrous" [...] idea which if the writers were to [...] "stumble upon" [...] now, [...] "we'd simply see Bart happen upon a license and skip town without anyone noticing, but here they do give the setup {{a great deal of}} consideration {{both on and off the}} screen." [...] He thought the story was [...] "partly believable, though the opportunity when Bart hits the road is largely wasted with only a few well constructed jokes to speak of." [...] Foster thinks, [...] "what saves the episode is the opportunity to see Lisa and Homer connect, once again displaying what a strong season this is for Lisa as we see the two share some wonderfully tender moments, alongside some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode and said that he [...] "loves" [...] the children's experiences at their parents' jobs, adding, [...] "and when they head out of town, the fun continues. Any episode that sends the kids to the site of the World's Fair is OK by me." [...] Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered the best part of the episode to be when Patty and Selma explain their job at the DMV: [...] "Somedays we don't let the line move at all. We call those weekdays." [...] Malkowski concluded her review by giving the episode a grade of B+. John Thorpe of Central Michigan Life named it the eighth best episode of the series. Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a score of 9.5 out of 10, calling it [...] "outstanding" [...] and summarizing his review with: [...] ""Bart on the Road" [...] is a fun trip and very funny, but it's the way <b>everything</b> <b>comes</b> together that really makes it memorable." ...|$|E

2500|$|For {{some time}} Mahal thought of {{pursuing}} farming over music.

By age nineteen he had become farm foreman, getting up a bit after 4:00a.m. and running the place. [...] "I milked anywhere between thirty-five and seventy cows a day. I clipped udders. I grew corn.

[...] Mahal believes in growing one's own food, saying, [...] "You have a whole generation of kids who think <b>everything</b> <b>comes</b> out of a box and a can, and they don't know you can grow most of your food."
