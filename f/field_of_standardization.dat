Terminology is indispensable here. This is because terminology plays a crucial role wherever and whenever specialized information and knowledge is being prepared (e.g. in research and development), used (e.g. in specialized texts), recorded and processed (e.g. in data banks), passed on (via training and teaching), implemented (e.g. in technology and knowledge transfer), or translated and interpreted.

40|$|M. A. (Linguistics) Unlike in {{the natural}} {{sciences}}, the study <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> the social sciences are closely related and large areas overlap - {{with regard to the}} use of terminology as well. However there are also differences, and in an institution such as the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) which comprises a heterogeneous community of subject specialists, not only the different subjects fields are represented, but also the different schools of thought (universities). In order to conduct human sciences research, the subject specialists should communicate with one another within these subject fields, but also across the borders of the different human sciences disciplines. The aim {{of this study was to}} standardize selected human sciences terminology used in the HSRC in order to provide a source of such terminology to be used mainly by HSRC personnel, and to enhance communication in this way. A theoretical review <b>of</b> the <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>standardization</b> and sUbject lexicography was given. The former field was subdivided into linguistic standardization, technical language standardization and organizational standardization, and a clear organizational standardization process was distinguished on the basis of the steps of collecting, submitting, processing and distributing terminology. The <b>field</b> <b>of</b> subject lexicography concerned technical dictionaries and terminology lists, and the issue of computerizing terminology was also dealt with. The organizational standardization process with respect to HSRC terminology was explained and problematic terms identified in the study were discussed. The terminology involved in the study had been collected over a number of years by the language practitioners at the Centre for Language Services eCLS) of the HSRC, recorded on cards and later entered into the computer. In the study the terminology was submitted to the various sUbject specialists in the HSRC for their comment and approval, and their comments were subsequently researched and discussed by the CLS. The next step in the standardization process involves the processing of the comments so that the terminology can be distributed in the form of a publication or by means of a computerized database. The use of standardized terminology in the HSRC can contribute greatly towards improving communication between subject specialists and if the computerized information is transferred to the National Term Bank of the National Terminology Services as planned, the standardized HSRC terminology can be of use outside the HSRC as well...|$|R

This problem is approached by examining how B 2 B adoption has evolved, what the benefits and costs of B 2 B integration are, and what the technologies used are and what is the role of standardization in B 2 B integration? At first we examine the definitions for B 2 B integration. After that, the adoption of B 2 B integration is studied through different standpoints, which are EDI, e-procurement, SCM, e-hubs, and RosettaNet and ebXML. The benefits and costs are studied from strategic and operational viewpoints. Especially quality of service and supply chain agility are perceived as strategic benefits while operational benefits are more easily measured.
