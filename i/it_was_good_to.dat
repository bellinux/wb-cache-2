He said although it started slow, [...] "once this episode found its legs, it was non-stop funny." [...] Isler praised the South Park writers for {{coming up with}} a surprisingly funny plot, and said it ranked among Butters' best moments in the series. Carlos Delgado of iF Magazine said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> see an episode focused strictly on comedy, after a string of episodes focusing on social satire. Delgado said the premise of the episode was absurd and over-the-top, but appreciated that South Park was continuing to push boundaries by mocking such issues as prostitution.|$|E
500|$|Norwood said in January 2011 that Fatboy has {{developed}} {{over time and}} is continuing to develop, with more sides to his personality being shown. Fatboy's caring side is shown in several EastEnders scenes, most notably his friendship with Dot, and a scene where Fatboy and Mercy bring a cake to Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) after her child dies of cot death. Although Norwood said in January 2011 that Fatboy {{will always be a}} joker, he felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> show Fatboy's softer, more intelligent side, saying that the character's [...] "street" [...] side drops quickly when he is around Dot and Mercy. Norwood said that Fatboy wants to improve himself, but fears that showing his caring side in London will get him beaten up.|$|E

In an interview with IGN, Clive Russell stated he was hopeful {{to return to the}} role saying [...] "I'd hoped that he'd come back because he comes back in the books again. But they're not doing the books -- there is no book to do it from. I'd hoped that would happen. I don't think I was surprised it would happen because they bring back all kinds of people at all kinds of times. But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> go back there, I must say." ...|$|E

Barr allegedly tweeted [...] "At first I thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> let ppl know that no one can hide anymore ...

The Seminole County Circuit Court complaint sought more than $15,000 for emotional distress and invasion of privacy. In August 2015, summary judgment was granted in favor of Barr.|$|E
500|$|Woodburne {{has said}} she never gets bored of playing Susan as she changes all the time. She added [...] "One of the upsides of this job {{is that in a}} week you might be doing {{absolute}} slapstick comedy, you might be doing high drama/tragedy and in between maybe some nice subtle interesting stuff as well, the character keeps changing and evolving depending on who she is interacting with". Woodburne has said that her favourite storyline has been the Susan, Karl and Izzy love triangle. As Susan is normally a good person, it gave her a chance to have a character (Izzy) that she could hate. Woodburne added [...] "It was good to play those much meaner, darker, angrier, cruel moments than always to be the kind character. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> see those dents in her armour I think".|$|E
500|$|Asher {{is one of}} {{the four}} main {{characters}} in series two of EastEnders: E20, alongside Sol, Naz and Stevie. They were created by the programme's team of thirteen writers. Actor and singer Heshima Thompson auditioned for the series, having learned about it from his agent. Part of the process involved a dance audition with Tony Adigun, the leader of dance group Avant Garde. Thompson was subsequently cast as Asher, and the character and his casting were announced on 28 July 2010. Deborah Sathe, the show's producer, expressed pride in the writers and stated, [...] " [...] have created four new faces for [...] Square and their reaction to Walford life is really exciting." [...] Thompson called E20 [...] "a great project to be part of", and eagerly anticipated the dancing the role would entail. He later {{said in an interview with}} Daniel Kilkelly from entertainment news website Digital Spy that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> be able to combine his love of acting with his love of dance.|$|E

500|$|Nick Campbell of TV.com {{felt that}} the episode was [...] "a decent if uneven {{penultimate}} episode that gave us {{one last look at}} this quirky group of people in their office environment". He was largely happy with the return of the fun-loving version of Jim, noting that [...] "Pam mentioned that she loves 'Goofy Jim' and I, [...] have to admit, I love Goofy Jim myself". Campbell {{felt that the}} episode dabbled in fan service, but that it was expected and needed for the show to have a successful ending. Roth Cornet of IGN awarded the episode an 8.5 out of 10, denoting a [...] "great" [...] episode. She wrote that [...] "The interplay between Jim, Dwight, and Pam has been the core of the series since Michael Scott's departure, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> see the trio front and center once again as The Office comes to a close."

He said it was not the easiest win he had but that the result could not be changed and he felt satisfied to clinch the victory on a track where his team did not expect to be dominant. Hamilton stated that he felt it was [...] "very positive" [...] that he remained the Drivers' Championship leader and his team McLaren were still {{at the top of the}} Constructors' Championship heading into the British Grand Prix. He hoped that he would be able to close the gap between the two Red Bull cars and challenge them. Button said that the first lap of the race was [...] "fun", and felt that the McLaren and Red Bull teams were strong but did not want to dismiss Ferrari from the championship battle.

500|$|Sullivan Stapleton plays Damien Scott, {{a former}} United States Delta Force {{operator}} who {{is familiar with}} the antagonists of the second series, and an acquaintance of John Porter. He is recruited by Section 20 to help Sergeant Michael Stonebridge find and rescue the kidnapped Porter. Stapleton describes Scott as cocky, rebellious and arrogant, and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> have somebody like him in Section 20 because [...] "he is the one that usually goes in first and takes the bullets, whereas Stonebridge arrives at the last minute and saves the day." [...] The actor opined that Scott is chosen for the dangerous role because he is daring and does not have any immediate family members who rely on him. Of Scott and Stonebridge's working relationship, Stapleton said [...] "they have a professional respect for each other" [...] but start to annoy each other. When the actor first read the script for Project Dawn, he saw himself for the role as Scott. Because Stapleton is an Australian actor, he had to speak with an American accent throughout the series. He was wary whether he did it right because he barely worked with Americans on the show, but believed he did okay when HBO, the network that operated Cinemax, was satisfied with it. Stapleton has signed up for another Strike Back series should it be commissioned.|$|E

Waring felt that Cindy does not plan to split Darren and Nancy up but that there is [...] "a little part of [...] that thinks, 'Surely he's going to choose me?" [...] Waring added that when Cindy is trying on wedding dresses for Nancy Cindy thinks [...] "that it should be her". Cindy attempts to kiss Darren which Waring said is [...] "the worst possible thing she could have done, because she thinks it means something but Darren thinks otherwise". Dawson said Darren is no longer interested in Cindy. Waring said Darren telling Cindy {{she will have to}} let him go leaves her [...] "devastated". Waring added that when Cindy realises how much Darren likes Nancy she says [...] "that if Nancy is who Darren wants, then she'll just have to accept it".

500|$|TV Squad's Bob Sassone enjoyed Jan Hooks' appearance, {{and said}} that her role as Jenna's mother was [...] "good casting." [...] His only {{complaint}} was that this episode {{had nothing to do}} with The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan, the fictional show on 30 Rock, and hoped that no other characters have to stay at Liz's apartment. [...] "Laughter wasn't constant during , but the direction it moved in kept interest even when jokes were sparse. That being said, some of the material... were pretty great by even the show's lofty standards", said Paste magazine's Sean Gandert. In his recap, Adam Mersel for TV Guide was complimentary, writing it had [...] "spot-on one-liners, witty pop culture references, and a hilarious guest-star in Jan Hooks", and that [...] "Verna" [...] became his favorite episode of the season. Nick Catucci for New York magazine liked Liz and Frank's plot, noting that their bad habits featured here [...] "culminated in the greatest few moments the show has had in some time." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin enjoyed this episode of 30 Rock, writing that the show [...] "was firing on all cylinders. It was good for laughs aplenty but it also helped illuminate Jack's paternal relationship with Jenna, the source of some of Jenna's narcissistic craziness and the full measure of Jack's Oedipal hell." [...] Margaret Lyons for Entertainment Weekly deemed [...] "Verna" [...] a solid episode from the show.

500|$|Despite {{positive}} assessments, [...] "Space Race: Part II" [...] {{produced more}} variety within critical opinion. In his [...] "commendable" [...] 8.6 {{out of ten}} rating review, Ross Bonaime of Paste asserted that the program displayed some exceptional dimension into the characters—from Lana's apparent self-consciousness, to Cheryl's eccentric and [...] "odd" [...] persona, and Krieger's past. Ultimately, Bonaime professed that [...] "Space Race: Part II" [...] was slightly inferior to its predecessor; [...] "'Space Race, Part II' doesn’t {{have some of the}} big laughs that the first part featured. By that, I mean Archer never rode Cyril through waves of Lana’s puke joyously. It is a step down from the first part comedically, but the episode does give us a few fun moments for each member of the cast." [...] Analogous sentiments were echoed by Blair Marnell of CraveOnline, who concluded: [...] "The space adventure had some fun moments, but it seemed to lack the punch provided by the two episodes that proceeded it. Even though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> see Barry again this season, his appearance in this episode seemed pretty tacked on." [...] VanDerWerff affirmed that the episode was a superb conclusion to Archer third season, despite not being as [...] "relentlessly entertaining" [...] as [...] "Space Race: Part I". While deeming the episode as a hilarious finale, TV Overmind writer Kevin Fitzpatrick claimed that [...] "Space Race: Part II" [...] left many unanswered questions to the audience. Conversely, Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic applauded the episode, issuing it a 4.7 out of 5 stars. [...] "Archer ended its third season tonight with the conclusion to its two part episode, 'Space Race'. And, man, from the second Archer announced he left his light saber in his other space pants, you knew you were in for a solid ending." ...|$|E

[...] The season's penultimate entry, [...] "A.A.R.M.", received a glowing response from many critics. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote that the episode was [...] "surprisingly... terrific in most areas." [...] Roth Cornet of IGN noted that [...] "The interplay between Jim, Dwight, and Pam has been {{the core of the}} series since Michael Scott's departure, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> see the trio front and center once again as The Office comes to a close."

Cornet wrote that it [...] "was a strong hour of television [...] the finale shone and delivered on all of its promise." [...] Nick Campbell of TV.com wrote that the episode was [...] "just right" [...] for the series. Other episodes were not received as positively. [...] "Lice", for instance, was called [...] "terrible" [...] by Campbell, as well as the [...] "epitome of filler" [...] by Brett Davinger of The California Literary Review.
