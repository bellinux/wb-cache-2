50|$|Histomonas meleagridis is {{species of}} {{parasitic}} protozoan that infects {{a wide range}} of birds including chickens, turkeys, peafowl, quail and pheasants, causing infectious enterohepatitis, or <b>histomoniasis</b> (blackhead dieases). H. meleagridis can infect many birds, but it is most deadly in turkeys. It inhabits the lumen of cecum and parenchyma of liver, where it causes extensive necrosis. It is transmitted by another cecal parasite, the nematode Heterakis gallinarum.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Histomoniasis</b> (or histomonosis), {{also known}} as {{blackhead}} disease, is a commercially important disease of poultry, particularly of chickens and turkeys, due to parasitic infection of a protozoan, Histomonas meleagridis. The protozoan is transmitted to the bird by the nematode parasite Heterakis gallinarum. H. meleagridis resides within the eggs of H. gallinarum, so birds ingest the parasites along with contaminated soil or food. Earthworms can also act as a paratenic host.|$|E
50|$|Heterakis gallinarum is a {{nematode}} parasite {{that lives}} in the cecum of some galliform birds, particularly in ground feeders such as domestic chickens and turkeys. It causes infection that is mildly pathogenic. However, it often carries a protozoan parasite Histomonas meleagridis which causes of <b>histomoniasis</b> (blackhead disease). Transmission of H. meleagridis is through the H. gallinarum egg. H. gallinarum is about 1-2 cm in length with a sharply pointed tail and a preanal sucker. The parasite is a diecious species with marked sexual dimorphism. Males are smaller and shorter, measuring around 9 mm in length, with a unique bent tail. Females are stouter and longer, measuring roughly 13 mm in length, with a straight tail end.|$|E
50|$|A {{protozoan}} H. meleagridis {{is responsible}} for <b>histomoniasis</b> of gallinaceous birds ranging from chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, grouse, guineafowl, partridges, pheasants, and quails. The protozoan parasite is transmitted through the eggs of a nematode, Heterakis gallinarum. The eggs are highly resistant to environmental conditions, and H. meleagridis is, in turn, highly viable inside the eggs, even for years. Birds are infected once they ingest the eggs of the nematode in soil, or sometimes through earthworms which had ingested the egg-contaminated soil. Outbreak can occur rapidly from the heavily infected bird in a flock readily through normal contact between uninfected and infected birds and their droppings in the total absence of cecal worms. For this reason, infection can spread very quickly. Once inside the digestive system of the host, the protozoan is moved to the cecum along with the eggs of H. gallinarum.|$|E
50|$|<b>Histomoniasis</b> is {{characterized}} by blackhead in birds. H. meleagridis is released in the cecum where the eggs of the nematode undergo larval development. The parasite migrates to the mucosa and submucosa where they cause extensive and severe necrosis of the tissue. Necrosis is initiated by inflammation and gradual ulceration, causing thickening of the cecal wall. The lesions are sometimes exacerbated by other pathogens such as Escherichia coli and coccidia. Histomonads then gain entry into small veins of the blood stream from the cecal lesions and migrate to the liver, causing focal necrosis. Turkeys are noted to be most susceptible to the symptoms in terms of mortality, sometimes approaching 100% of a flock. Diagnosis can be easily performed by necropsy of the fresh or preserved carcass. Unusual lesions have been observed in other organs of turkey such as the bursa of Fabricius, lungs, and kidneys.|$|E
50|$|H. meleagridis is {{the causal}} {{organism}} of <b>histomoniasis</b> of gallinaceous birds. It induces extensive and severe necrosis of the tissues of the mucosa and submucosa of cecum and parenchyma of the liver. The lesions are sometimes exacerbated by other pathogens such as Escherichia coli and coccidia. The symptoms appear within seven to 12 days after infection, and include depression, reduced appetite, poor growth, increased thirst, sulphur-yellow diarrhoea, listlessness, drooping wings, and unkempt feathers. The symptoms are highly fatal to turkeys, but effect less damage in chickens. However, outbreaks in chickens {{may result in}} high morbidity, moderate mortality, and extensive culling, leading to overall poor flock performance. Concurrence of Salmonella typhmurium and E. coli was found to cause high mortality in broiler chickens. Young birds, particularly those three to 12 weeks old, are most susceptible. Generally, the symptoms are profound in turkeys, while chickens are usually asymptomatic.|$|E
40|$|Six {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate the effect of added nifursol on growth and feed utilization in turkeys and its efficacy against <b>histomoniasis.</b> Data from these experiments indicate or suggest that nifursol tends to stimulate growth, is not toxic at levels of 50 to 1600 ppm, and has good efficacy against <b>histomoniasis</b> at relatively low levels. Three growth studies were conducted in which nifursol levels of 50 to 1600 ppm, were fed in a practical-type, corn-soybean diet (28 percent protein). Turkeys fed from day old to four weeks of age were used in these studies. None of the nifursol levels depressed body weight gain or increased mortality {{as compared to the}} unsupplemented basal diet. Nifursol, when fed continuously to male and female turkeys from day-old to 24 weeks of age at levels of 0, 50, 75, 100, and 200 ppm., tended to increase or had no effect on body weight gain. Survival and body weight data indicated that nifursol at the levels used was not toxic over extended feeding periods. Two <b>histomoniasis</b> exposure {{experiments were}} conducted with poults 33 - 71 ad 78 - 121 days of age. Mortality and morbidity due to <b>histomoniasis</b> were significantly reduced (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) in the medicated, exposed poults as compared to the unmedicated, exposed poults. The data indicated that the level of nifursol added to diets of older birds may be reduced below the level necessary for protection in younger birds, due to the increased feed and/or drug intake of older turkeys. The most effective protection against mortality and morbidity due to <b>histomoniasis</b> in both experiments was observed with the addition of 75 ppm of nifursol in the diets. Advisor: Thomas W.

40|$|International audienceHistomoniasis or {{blackhead}} is {{a disease}} of gallinaceous birds, caused by the protozoon Histomonas meleagridis. As recent regulatory action has removed almost all drugs against this disease from the European market, {{the development of new}} prophylactics has become crucial. Identification of the protective immune mechanism would facilitate the choice and development of a vaccination strategy to prevent <b>histomoniasis.</b> In this study, turkeys were either actively or passively immunized and challenged to assess the role of antibody-mediated immunity in the protection against this disease. Active immunization was performed either by experimental infection and treatment or by intramuscular injection with lysed H. meleagridis. Passive immunization was achieved by intraperitoneal administration of the pooled, concentrated and neutralizing antisera from immunized donor animals to naïve turkeys. A significantly higher IgG response was observed after infection and treatment, compared to the response after intramuscular injection, which in turn was higher than those of the placebo and control birds. While active immunization by intramuscular injection of dead H. meleagridis antigens appears not to be protective, immunization of turkeys by infection and treatment did induce protection against <b>histomoniasis.</b> However, no significant level of protection could be observed in the passively immunized birds.

40|$|<b>Histomoniasis</b> or {{blackhead}} is {{a disease}} of gallinaceous birds, caused by the protozoon Histomonas meleagridis. Since traditional diagnostics {{for the detection of}} this disease are complex and far less sensitive than molecular tools, a PCR would provide a more rapid and sensitive alternative. However, intestinal material and droppings, which are preferably used in epidemiological studies of <b>histomoniasis,</b> often contain PCR inhibitory substances. To detect these false negative results, the use of an internal amplification control is essential. Nevertheless, the recently developed PCR tests lack this internal control. Therefore, a new PCR assay with H. meleagridis specific primers was developed which does include an internal amplification control. The diagnostic value of the PCR assay was evaluated in comparison to three other conventional H. meleagridis specific PCR tests (HIS 5, HM 1 and HM 2). None of the organ samples originating from uninfected turkeys, showed positive PCR results in any of the tests. Among the lesion-positive, inhibition-free samples, 95. 4 % were positive by our PCR assay, while only 50, 66. 7 and 83. 3 % of the lesion-positive organs tested positive by the HM 1, the HIS 5 and the HM 2 PCR respectively. In conclusion, our PCR offers the use of the internal control to detect false negative results and an increased sensitivity, and thus should be useful for routine diagnosis of H. meleagridis in poultry.

This NebGuide discusses the organisms that cause the disease and prevention strategies. Raising small turkey home flocks in the early summer and late fall is extremely popular in Nebraska. Most of these birds are destined for slaughter just before Thanksgiving and are sold for the holiday market.

Most poultry flock owners have heard of this disease but few really understand the cause or how the illness is spread. Blackhead, also known as <b>Histomoniasis,</b> is caused by a microscopic, single-celled organism Histomonas meleagridis. Although best known as a disease of turkeys, the organism infects other birds as well, including peafowl, pheasants, quail, grouse, partridge, and chickens. Of these, the chicken is most resistant to illness from Blackhead. Hence, chickens can be carriers and can contaminate a premise, but they usually do not get sick.

40|$|International audienceHistomonas meleagridis is a trichomonad {{species that}} {{undergoes}} a flagellate-to-amoeba transformation during tissue invasion and causes a serious disease in gallinaceous birds (blackhead disease or <b>histomoniasis).</b> Living in the avian cecum, the flagellated form {{can be grown}} in vitro {{in the presence of}} an ill-defined bacterial flora. Its cytoplasm harbours numerous spherical bodies which structurally resemble hydrogenosomes. To test whether these organelles may be involved in anaerobic metabolism, we undertook the identification of H. meleagridis genes encoding some potentially conserved hydrogenosomal enzymes. The strategy was based on several PCR amplification steps using primers designed from available sequences of the phylogenetically-related human parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. We first obtained a C-terminal sequence of an iron-hydrogenase homologue (Hm_HYD) with typical active site signatures (H-cluster domain). Immunoelectron microscopy with anti-Hm_HYD polyclonal antibodies showed specific gold labelling of electron-dense organelles, thus confirming their hydrogenosomal nature. The whole genes encoding a malic enzyme (Hm_ME) and the alpha-subunit of a succinyl coenzyme A synthetase (Hm_alpha-SCS) were then identified. Short N-terminal presequences for hydrogenosomal targeting were predicted in both proteins. Anti-Hm_ME and anti-Hm_alpha-SCS antisera provided immunofluorescence staining patterns of H. meleagridis cytoplasmic granules similar to those observed with anti-Hm_HYD antiserum or mAb F 5. 2 known to react with T. vaginalis hydrogenosomes. Hm_ME, Hm_alpha-SCS and Hm_HYD were also detected as reactive bands on immunoblots of proteins from purified hydrogenosomes.
