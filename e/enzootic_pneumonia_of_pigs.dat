The main focus of this thesis is on the historical examination, only in extracts present knowledge is being referred to. Current knowledge is reserved to recent publications. The thesis is structured according to the historical epochs. For a better understanding and structuring within the historical context the political-territorial, economic, scientific, medical and veterinary conditions are described in detail. On the basis of historical sources it has been tried to assign the received information <b>of</b> <b>enzootic</b> <b>pneumonia,</b> or other diseases of swine.

40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to map the {{situation}} of swine mycoplasmoses on four farms {{in the region of}} Eastern Slovakia. The primary agent <b>of</b> <b>Enzootic</b> <b>pneumonia</b> <b>of</b> swine is Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae. After reviewing the health status of conventional herds and evaluation of clinical symptoms, paired samples of nasal swabs and venous blood samples were collected from 38 pigs with clinical signs of respiratory disease. Nasal swab samples were tested by nested PCR, while blood samples were used to detect antibodies against M. hyopneumoniae by blocking ELISA. The presence of M. hyopneumoniae was confirmed by nested PCR in four pigs (10. 5 %) and by blocking ELISA in 16 pigs (42. 1 %) of all four farms.

40|$|Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, the {{etiologic}} agent <b>of</b> porcine <b>enzootic</b> <b>pneumonia,</b> synthesizes a 36 -kDa protein {{which is an}} early and strong immunogenic factor in experimentally and naturally infected swine. The gene encoding this protein was cloned by screening a gene library of M. hyopneumoniae DNA with rabbit hyperimmune serum made against whole M. hyopneumoniae cells and convalescent-phase swine serum. Analysis of the recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli by immunoblot techniques showed that the protein is expressed in E. coli in its full length and does not cross-react with proteins from M. flocculare or M. hyorhinis. Genetic analysis showed that the gene was expressed from the lac promoter of the vector {{and seems to be}} translationally initiated from its own ribosome binding site.

40|$|Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M. hyo), {{the cause}} <b>of</b> <b>enzootic</b> <b>pneumonia</b> in swine, is a {{worldwide}} problem. Despite the developmental vaccines {{that have been}} commercially available for several years, M. hyo-induced pneumonia is still a major concern to swine producers. The pathologic lesions observed with <b>enzootic</b> <b>pneumonia</b> consist primarily <b>of</b> a lymphoid cell infiltration of the lungs.

40|$|Graduation date: 1979 In October 1977, a {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} role of bovine adenovirus type 3 in <b>enzootic</b> <b>pneumonia</b> <b>of</b> calves, and the efficacy of using a vaccine for prevention of disease. Bovine adenovirus type 3 was isolated from the herd under study in the previous year. Calves in the herd were experiencing <b>enzootic</b> <b>pneumonia</b> associated with conjunctivitis and keratoconjunctivitis. Initial signs of disease included excessive lacrimation, pyrexia, nasal discharge and coughing. As the disease progressed, effected animals exhibited respiratory embarassment (especially upon exertion), malaise, low weight gains, and pneumonitis (as determined {{by the presence of}} dyspnea, and by stethoscopic examination for the detection of abnormal lung sounds). Forty-two one to five day old calves were randomly chosen for the study. Twenty-one calves were vaccinated with bovine adenovirus type 3 experimental vaccine. The vaccine consisted of a killed viral preparation with an aluminum hydroxide adjuvant, and was prepared by a commercial biological firm. The remaining twenty-one calves were unvaccinated controls. Two of the vaccinated calves experienced pneumonia, nine-conjunctivitis and two [...] keratoconjunctivitis. No fatalities occurred among the vaccinated calves. Fourteen of the vaccinated calves produced a four-fold or greater rise in the titer of serum-viral neutralizing antibodies to bovine adenovirus type 3, strain 5 C. Five calves had high levels of colostral viral serum-neutralizing antibodies which interferred with active antibody production. Two calves had low levels of colostral antibodies and low levels of active antibody production. No adverse side-effect was noted at the vaccination site in any of the vaccinated animals. Eleven of the control calves experienced pneumonia, three [...] conjunctivitis and eleven [...] keratoconjunctivitis. Eight of the control calves died. Seven of the control calves produced a four-fold or greater rise in the serum-viral neutralizing antibody titer to bovine adenovirus type 3, strain 5 C.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this work}} the {{relationship}} between lung lesions <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> with <b>Enzootic</b> <b>Pneumonia</b> and kidney lesions during sanitary inspection at slaughter was investigated. For this purpose sixty-nine <b>Enzootic</b> <b>Pneumonia</b> positive lung samples and sixty-nine negative ones as well as kidneys from the same pigs were post mortem examined. Microscopic examination revealed that 54. 28 % <b>of</b> the <b>pigs</b> (58 / 138) had both lesions, an association significant by Chi-square (P< 0. 05). The intensity of this association, by “Odds ratio ” value of 0. 2267 was also significant (0. 09045 - 0. 5683).

Multiple logistic regression analysis of the dichotomized data revealed that 3 farm types had an increased risk <b>of</b> having <b>enzootic</b> <b>pneumonia.</b> Multiple source feeder barns (farm Type 4) with low emphasis on disease entry and control had an odds ratio of 2. 38, meaning that farms closely matching this farm type were over {{twice as likely to}} have <b>enzootic</b> <b>pneumonia</b> for every one unit increase in the factor score. Family farms using floor feeding methods (Factor 5) had an odds ratio of 3. 31, suggesting that this combination of management styles may be a contributing factor in <b>enzootic</b> <b>pneumonia.</b> Integrated farms (Factor 6) had an odds ratio of 2. 31 for having the condition, suggesting that larger farms that mill their own feed and are closer in proximity to other pig farms have a greater chance <b>of</b> having <b>enzootic</b> <b>pneumonia.</b> A linear regression of the prevalence estimates <b>of</b> <b>enzootic</b> <b>pneumonia</b> on positive farms revealed that only farms with multiple source feeder barns and floor fed family farms were associated with a higher prevalence <b>of</b> <b>enzootic</b> <b>pneumonia.</b> Farms with extensive pig housing (Factor 1) were associated with a lower prevalence, suggesting that farms with ample pen space and air volume had fewer pigs with <b>enzootic</b> <b>pneumonia.</b> A similar analysis for pleuritis found a lower odds of lesions on farms with extensively housed pigs.

One clone (pSD 9), identified by Dr S. P. Djordjevic, contained a 0. 8 kb M. hyopneumoniae DNA fragment which encodes an immunoreactive antigen of that pathogen. This antigen was expressed as an 11 kDa M. hyopneumoniae component fused to the carboxy-terminus of the 117 kDa pgalactosidase protein to produce a 128 kDa fusion protein. Antibodies generated in rabbits against the 128 kDa fusion protein reacted in immunoblots against a 42 kDa protein of M hyopneumoniae. The vaccine potential of purified fusion protein was assessed in pig vaccine trials by delivery of the antigen emulsified in different adjuvant formulations.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare four {{different}} techniques that may be used to assess the prevalence or severity <b>of</b> <b>enzootic</b> <b>pneumonia</b> in a swine herd. These techniques included: 1) assessing the percentage of lung involved and calculating a mean percentage and standard deviation for each herd, 2) counting the number of lungs in the herd sample that have greater than a predetermined amount <b>of</b> <b>pneumonia</b> and calculating the prevalence of the sample thus affected, 3) scoring only the lung from each herd sample that was maximally affected by pneumonia, and 4) allocating lungs to categories depending on the approximate extent <b>of</b> <b>pneumonia.</b> Five hundred and sixty pigs from 41 different swine herds in southern Minnesota were examined at slaughter and lungs were evaluated for the extent <b>of</b> <b>pneumonia</b> that was macroscopically visible...|$|R
5000|$|Tilmicosin is a {{macrolide}} antibiotic. It {{is used in}} {{veterinary medicine}} {{for the treatment of}} bovine respiratory disease and <b>enzootic</b> <b>pneumonia</b> caused by Mannheimia (Pasteurella) haemolytica in sheep. In humans, Tilmicosin causes fatal cardiotoxic effects at amounts greater than 1 milliliter when injected, something most commonly seen in veterinary personnel and farmers.|$|R
40|$|Infection with {{transmissible}} gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) {{was present in}} some pigs on arrival at a feeder pig farm and was well established three weeks later. TGE infection preceded Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae infection, which was not detected until three weeks after arrival. Severe lesions <b>of</b> <b>enzootic</b> <b>pneumonia</b> were observed {{at the end of}} the fattening period...|$|R
