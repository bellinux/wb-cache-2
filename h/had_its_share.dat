5|$|In regular service, the Pioneer Zephyr <b>had</b> <b>its</b> <b>share</b> of accidents. In 1939 it was {{involved}} in a head-on collision with a freight train that completely destroyed the cab. The train was rebuilt and re-entered revenue service soon afterward, but the accident strengthened the desire of locomotive designers to move the cab back {{from the front of the}} locomotive to above a large nose, as on EMD F-unit and EMD E-unit locomotives.|$|E
5|$|Loring also <b>had</b> <b>its</b> <b>share</b> of {{incidents}} {{that did not}} result in fatalities over the years. On 6 March 1955, a B-36 Peacemaker crashed and burned in a snowbank at Loring. All crewmembers were able to escape unharmed. On 26 June 1958, a B-52D (55‑0102) burned on the ground at Loring and was destroyed. On 25 May 1969, a KC-135A (56–3602) broke in two after aborting takeoff. The cause was a frozen water injection surge tube. On 19 July 1970, a B-52G (58‑0208) also caught on fire and was destroyed on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the release}} of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, on 26 June 1997, the books have found immense popularity, {{critical}} acclaim and commercial success worldwide. They have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers, and are often considered cornerstones of modern young adult literature.

One of the traders was Kwong Hup Yuen who, it is thought, occupied No. 37, and after whom Pagoda Street is often referred to today.|$|E

25|$|Their {{intrusion}} into Jaffna also had other unintended consequences. The concentration of efficient Protestant mission schools in Jaffna produced a revival movement among local Hindus led by Arumuga Navalar, who responded by building many more schools within the Jaffna peninsula. Local Catholics too started their own schools as a countermeasure. The state also <b>had</b> <b>its</b> <b>share</b> of {{primary and secondary}} schools. Thus saturated with educational opportunities, many Tamils became literate. This {{was used by the}} British colonial government to hire Tamils as government servants in British-held Ceylon, India, Malaysia and Singapore.|$|E
25|$|The Belle Époque {{was spared}} the violent uprisings that brought down two French {{regimes in the}} 19th century, but it <b>had</b> <b>its</b> <b>share</b> of {{political}} and social conflicts and occasional violence. Labor unions and strikes had been legalized during the regime of Napoleon III. The first labor union congress in Paris took place in October 1876, and the socialist party recruited many members among the Paris workers. On May 1, 1890, the socialists organized the first celebration of May Day, the international day of labor. Since it was an unauthorized celebration, it led to confrontations between police and demonstrators.|$|E
25|$|The {{first day}} of the Exposition <b>had</b> <b>its</b> <b>share</b> of difficulties. Only a fifth of the {{electric}} lights could be turned on, and the Warpath recreation area was far from ready. Construction of the government pier left much of the ground {{in the center of the}} exposition muddy soup. Of the thirty-eight principal buildings and works that the Exposition Company planned for the fair, only fourteen had been completed by opening day—the Fire Engine House and the Waterfront Board Walk having been completed only in the last two days. The company failed to complete two planned buildings, the Historic Art and Education buildings, by the Exposition’s end in late November.|$|E

The match {{would go to the}} first player to win six games, draws not counting. After 17 games, Karpov had an imposing 4–1 lead. Korchnoi won game 21, but Karpov won game 27, putting him on the brink of victory with a 5–2 lead. Korchnoi bravely fought back, scoring three wins and one draw in the next four games, to equalise the match at 5–5 after 31 games. However, Karpov won the very next game, and the match, by 6–5 with 21 draws.|$|E

He spent 19 of the following 23 seasons as a general manager of the Flyers, also briefly serving as general manager of the Minnesota North Stars and Florida Panthers, and reached the Stanley Cup Finals three times with the Flyers and once with Minnesota. His time as an NHL general manager <b>had</b> <b>its</b> <b>share</b> of controversy, perhaps none greater than the rift between him and star player Eric Lindros during the late 1990s and early 2000s. He resigned from the general manager position less than a month into the 2006–07 season and is currently the Flyers' senior vice president.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the ongoing}} lineup turmoil, Dinosaur Jr. signed with Sire Records in 1990. They made their major-label debut Green Mind in 1991. The new record was {{virtually}} a JMascis solo album, with Murph playing drums on {{only a few}} songs, as well as minimal contributions from Fleming and Spiegel, who {{were out of the}} band by the time the album was released. Mascis, whose first instrument was a drum kit, recorded many of the drum parts by himself, layering the various instrumental parts through overdubbing. While Mascis' guitar, voice and songwriting ensured that the album <b>had</b> <b>its</b> <b>share</b> of the band's old sound, it was much quieter and more layered, with more use of keyboards and acoustic guitar, and with a noticeable lack of the power-trio roar for which the original lineup had been known.|$|E
