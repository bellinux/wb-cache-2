[...] The second generation P-series diaphragms remained the same stainless steel, however the inlet to the power chamber was now round, due to elimination of the core in the casting pattern.

40|$|Simple optical {{technique}} enables quick, {{nondestructive inspection}} of surfaces of ceramic <b>diaphragms</b> and <b>disks</b> for fractures and discontinuities. Involves reflecting {{beam of light}} from laser at glancing angle of about 20 degrees to 25 degrees off surface inspected and examining pattern of reflected light on suitable viewing surface as beam swept across surface. When fracture present, reflection pattern separates into two or more speckled spots. Technique applied in inspection of ceramic diaphragms bearing electronic circuits. Also useful in detection of fatigue cracks on aircraft...|$|R
50|$|A two plate dry <b>disk</b> <b>diaphragm</b> {{spring clutch}} drove Fuller four-speed main and three-speed {{auxiliary}} transmissions. The main transmission had a “low” first gear and three road gears, 4th being direct. The auxiliary had low, direct, and overdrive gears. The low gear allowed several very low gears for extreme off-road use. The direct and overdrive allowed the three road gears to be split, making 6 road gears.|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this report was undertaken at the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics to determine a suitable method for measuring the maximum pressures occurring in aircraft engine cylinders. The study and development of instruments for the measurement of maximum cylinder pressures has been conducted in connection with carburetor and oil engine investigations on a single cylinder aircraft-type engine. Five maximum cylinder-pressure devices have been designed, and tested, {{in addition to the}} testing of three commercial indicators. Values of maximum cylinder pressures are given as obtained with various indicators for the same pressures and for various kinds and values of maximum cylinder pressures, produced chiefly by variation of the injection advance angle in high-speed oil engine. The investigations indicate that the greatest accuracy in determining maximum cylinder pressures can be obtained with an electric, balanced-pressure, diaphragm or disk-type indicator so constructed as to have a <b>diaphragm</b> or <b>disk</b> of relatively large area and minimum seat width and mass...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of the inkjet method to pharmaceutical products is promising. To make this realistic, {{not only does the}} throughput of this method need to be increased, but also the components should be inert to pharmaceutical preparations. We present designs of glass‐based inkjet devices that are capable of producing droplets at high rates. To achieve this, inkjet devices from glass capillary tubes were manufactured with orifice diameters of 5, 10 and 20 μm and were actuated with <b>diaphragm</b> piezoelectric <b>disks.</b> Also, a pressure capsule was formed by creating a manifold at a distance from the orifice tip. Placing the piezoelectric disk at 0. 5 mm distance from the tip allowed the formation of a jet at 3. 2 MHz in certain designs, but {{for a short period of}} time because of overheating. The length of the pressure capsule, its inlet diameter, and the nozzle tip geometry were crucial to lower the required power. Actuating an inkjet device with 10 μm orifice diameter comfortably at 900 kHz and drying the droplets from 1 % salbutamol sulphate solution allowed the formation of particles with diameters of 1. 76 ± 0. 15 μm and the geometric standard deviation of 1. 08. In conclusion, optimising internal design of glass inkjet devices allowed the production of high‐throughput droplet ejectors. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association J Pharm Sci 103 : 3733 – 3742, 201...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the first parylene-based floating-disk microvalve with self-pressure-regulating characteristics for various microfluidic applications. By incorporating a free-floating <b>disk</b> <b>diaphragm</b> with no anchoring/tethering structures to constrain its movement, the microvalve realizes configurable pressure-based flow-shunting functions in a stand-alone fashion. Its passive operation {{eliminates the need}} for power sources or the external actuation of the device. A multilayer polymer surface-micromachining technology is utilized for device fabrication by exploiting parylene C (poly-chloro-p-xylylene) as the biocompatible structural material for high mechanical compliance as compared with other conventional thin-film materials. Experimental results successfully demonstrate that the in-channel microvalves control water flows in the following two different shunt designs: 1) a nearly ideal regular check valve with zero forward-cracking pressure, zero reverse leakage, and 1. 25 x 10 ^ 13 - 2. 09 x 10 ^ 13 N·s/m^ 5 (0. 03 – 0. 05 psi·min/μL, 1. 55 – 2. 59 mmHg·min/μL) of fluidic resistance; and 2) a pressure–bandpass check valve with 0 – 100 mmHg and 0 – 10 μL/min of pressure and flow rate regulation ranges, respectively, as well as 4. 88 x 10 ^ 13 N·s/m^ 5 (0. 12 psi·min/μL, 6. 08 mmHg·min/μL) of fluidic resistance in the forward conductive region. Such a biocompatible and implantable microvalve has the great potential of being integrated in microfluidic systems to facilitate effective microflow control for lab-on-a-chip and biomedical applications...|$|R
