40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} model of stray-light suppression in the spectrometer channels of the Ultraviolet Coronagraph Spectrometer (UVCS) on the SOHO spacecraft. The control of diffracted and scattered stray {{light from the}} bright solar disk {{is one of the}} most important tasks of a coronagraph. We compute the fractions of light that diffract past the UVCS external occulter and non-specularly pass into the spectrometer slit. The <b>diffracted</b> <b>component</b> of the stray light depends on the finite aperture of the primary mirror and on its figure. The amount of non-specular scattering depends mainly on the micro-roughness of the mirror. For reasonable choices of these quantities, the modeled stray-light fraction agrees well with measurements of stray light made both in the laboratory and during the UVCS mission. The models were constructed for the bright H I Lyman alpha emission line, but they are applicable to other spectral lines as well. Comment: 19 pages, 5 figures, Solar Physics, in pres...|$|E

40|$|Laboratory and in situ {{methods have}} been used for {{measuring}} intrinsic performances of noise barriers, as prescribed by the European standard series EN 1793. The use of in situ techniques is promising, but their accuracy has to be duly verified, even in comparison with well-known standardized procedures. Sound insulation and reflection properties have been measured through a MLS-based technique in an outdoor test field. The paper analyzes the procedures that mainly influence the accuracy: correction for wave spreading and time windowing. Repeatability of the in situ method for sound insulation is satisfying and its results look consistent with simple prediction models. Nevertheless, in situ data can be overestimated at low frequencies, due to the overlapping of the transmitted and <b>diffracted</b> <b>components.</b> The method has to be carefully employed when the sample shows apertures as slits or holes, unless a different kind of sound propagation is assumed at the receiving side. A good agreement was found between in situ and laboratory sound insulation data, while in situ and laboratory absorption properties show poorer correlation...|$|R

The physical mechanism behind the effect is an inverse scattering cascade of <b>diffracted</b> wave <b>components</b> back into on-and near-axis angular field components, resulting in substantial enhancement of intensity of these components. We explore the super-collimation by numerical calculations and prove it experimentally. We demonstrate experimentally the axial field enhancement up to 7 times in terms of field intensity.

40|$|The {{computation}} of flow-induced noise at low Mach numbers usually {{relies on}} a two-step hybrid methodolgy. In the first step, an incompressible fluid dynamics simulation (CFD) is performed and an acoustic source term is derived from it. The latter becomes the inhomogeneous term for an acoustic wave equation, which is solved in the second step, often resorting to boundary integral formulations. In the presence of rigid bodies, Curie's acoustic analogy {{is probably the most}} extended approach. It has been shown that Curie's boundary dipolar noise contribution does in fact correspond to the diffraction of the quadrupolar aerodynamic noise generated by the flow past the rigid body. In this work, advantage is taken from this fact to propose an alternative computational methodology to get the individual quadrupolar and dipolar contributions to the total acoustic pressure. For any linear acoustic wave operator, the unknown acoustic pressure can be split into its incident and <b>diffracted</b> <b>components</b> and be computed simultaneously to the incompressible flow field, in a single finite element computational run. This circumvents the problem found in Curie's analogy of needing the total pressure at the body's boundary, which includes the acoustic pressure fluctuations. The latter cannot be obtained from an incompressible CFD simulation. The proposed unified strategy could be beneficial for a large variety problems such as those involving noise generated from duct terminations, or those related with the simulation of fricatives in numerical voice production, among many others.

40|$|The wavefronts of high {{frequency}} (HF) radio waves received after reflection from the ionosphere exhibit both spatial non-linearities and temporal variations which limit {{the performance of}} large aperture receiving arrays. The first objective {{of this investigation was}} to measure the phase and amplitude of ionospherically propagated signals at several widely spaced antennas in order to relate these parameters to the reflection process. From the amplitudes and phases measured at pairs of spaced antennas, the direction of arrival (DOA) of the signal in both azimuth and elevation was determined. Furthermore. by combining the DOA and reflection height measurements the transmitter location can be estimated from a single receiving site. The second objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the ability of the system to determine DOA and transmitter locations correctly. Two seven element antenna arrays were employed with maximum apertures of 1526 m and 294 m respectively. The associated multi-channel receiving and data logging equipment is described together with a pulsed sounding system employed for mode identification. Signals received from several European transmitters exhibited widely differing behaviour and this was interpreted in terms of their modal content. For predominantly single moded signals the observations indicate that the <b>diffracted</b> <b>components</b> normally contribute less than 10 % of the received power, moreover the DOA varies in both azimuth and elevation by approximately 1 - 2 ° over time periods of several minutes. The use of the smaller array for DF and SSL applications is discussed in detail. In particular, the performance of the system was severly affected by multi-moded propagation. Techniques were developed for recognising periods of single moded propagation, when accurate measurements are to be expected. Good position fixes were obtained when measurements were restricted to these periods provided accurate reflection height information was also available...|$|R

The objective {{of this investigation was}} to measure the phase and amplitude of ionospherically propagated signals in order to relate these parameters to the reflection process. This thesis describes the design and construction of a large aperture multi-element array and its implementation for wavefrot investigations. The hardware and software developed to control the equipment and to record the measurements are described. The procedures required to verify the performance of the experimental system are discussed and results are presented which demonstrate the accuracy of the measurements. The array was utilised for studies of signals received from several transmitters situated throughout Western Europe. The results obtained demonstrate the widely different behaviour of signals received over the various propagation paths and these have been related to the modal content of the received signals. Limited periods existed during which a single ionospheric mode was received and data corresponding to this condition have been compared with those which would be expected if the signal consisted of both a specular component and a cone of diffracted rays. This model is unable to explain the experimental results. Numerical models of the received signal were therefore developed. Results of these and comparisons with experimental results suggest that the measured parameters {{can be explained by the}} existence of a specular component with a varying direction of arrival (DOA), plus some contribution from random components.

30|$|Fast fading is {{the result}} of the {{constructive}} and destructive combination of randomly delayed, reflected, scattered, and <b>diffracted</b> signal <b>components.</b> This type of fading is relatively fast and is therefore responsible for the short-term signal variations that can occur when UEs or reflectors in an environment move short distances. In this paper, the fast-fading component of the signal is generated according to the WINNER II channel model [19]. The WINNER II channel model is suitable for indoor and outdoor users and is an evolution of the 3 GPP spatial channel model extended (SCME). WINNER II covers more scenarios than 3 GPP SCME and introduces additional features such as support for arbitrary 3 D antenna patterns, multidimensional channel modeling for carrier frequencies between 2 and 6 [*]GHz, and BWs up to 100 [*]MHz. WINNER II is a more reliable and practical model for system-level simulations than the SCME model.|$|R

40|$|In solving {{ultrasonic}} flaw characterization problems, flaw type {{information is}} often {{needed in order}} to pursue succeeding tasks such as flaw sizing. In a typical inspection, the interaction of the incident ultrasonic pulse with the flaw results in a series of signal trains. A variety of signal features are extracted from these flaw signals and then used {{as the basis for the}} classification process. This classification process is made difficult by the large number of possible scattered waves. For example, typical ultrasonic signals from a planar crack-like defect consist of reflected responses, surface traveling waves, edge diffracted waves and head wave components. For a volumetric void-like defect, the returned signal pattern similarly contains reflected waves of the same mode as well as mode-converted reflections and “creeping” waves. However, in pulse-echo testing a fundamental difference exists between a crack-like flaw and a volumetric flaw that can be used for classification purposes. This difference is reflected in the fact that a significant mode-converted <b>diffracted</b> wave <b>component</b> can exist for a crack-like defect (Fig. 1 (a)) which does not exist in pulse-echo testing for a volumetric defect (Fig. 1 (b)) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{geometrical}} theory of diffraction is extended {{to treat the}} radiation from apertures of slots in convex perfectly conducting surfaces. It is assumed that the tangential electric field in the aperture is known so that an equivalent infinitesimal source can be defined at each point in the aperture. Surface rays emanate from this source which is a caustic of the ray system. A launching coefficient is introduced to describe the excitation of the surface ray modes. If the field radiated from the surface is desired, the ordinary diffraction coefficients are {{used to determine the}} field of the rays shed tangentially from the surface rays. The field of the surface ray modes is not the field on the surface; hence if the mutual coupling between slots is of interest, a second coefficient related to the launching coefficient must be employed. In the region adjacent to the shadow boundary, the component of the field directly radiated from the source is represented by Fock-type functions. In the illuminated region the incident radiation from the source (this does not include the <b>diffracted</b> field <b>components)</b> is treated by geometrical optics. This extension of the geometrical theory of diffraction is applied to calculate the radiation from slots on elliptic cylinders, spheres, and spheroids...|$|R

Our goal is to developtools that accurately extract spectroscopic information of faint, point or extended sources {{in the vicinity of}} bright, point sources at separations approaching the realizable angular limits of HST with STIS. Diffracted and scattered light due to the HST optics, and scattered light effects within the STIS are addressed. Filter fringing, CCD fringing, window reflections, and scattering within the detector and other effects are noted. We have obtained spectra of several reference stars, used for flux calibration or for coronagraphic standards, that have spectral distributions ranging from very red to very blue. Spectra of each star were recorded with the star in the aperture and with the star blocked by either the F 1 or F 2 fiducial. Plots of the detected starlight along the spatial axis of the aperture are provided for four stars. With the star in the aperture, the line spread function is quite noticeable.

5000|$|Ptychography ( [...] πτυχο-γραφία, from πτυχή = fold + γραφή = writing/scripture) is a {{technique}} invented by Walter Hoppe that aims to solve the diffraction-pattern phase problem by interfering adjacent Bragg reflections coherently and thereby determine their relative phase. In the original formulation, Hoppe envisaged that such interference could be effected by placing a very narrow aperture in {{the plane of the}} specimen so that each reciprocal-lattice point would be spread out and thus overlap with other points. The name ptychography, from the Greek for fold, derives from this optical configuration; each reciprocal lattice point is convolved with some function, and thus made to interfere with its neighbors. In fact, measuring only the intensities of interfering adjacent diffracted beams still leads to an ambiguity of two possible complex conjugates for each underlying complex diffraction amplitude. The original formulation of ptychography is equivalent to the well known theorem that for a finite specimen (that is one delineated by a narrow aperture, sometimes known as a finite support), the one-dimensional phase problem is soluble to within an ambiguity of 2N, where N is the number of Fourier components that make up the specimen. However, such ambiguities may be resolved by changing the phase, profile or position of the illuminating beam in some way. The fact that not only the intensities of the diffracted beams but also the intensities lying midway between the beams, where the convolved Bragg beams interfere, is an alternative statement of the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem for <b>components</b> of <b>diffracted</b> intensity. These <b>components</b> generally have twice the frequency (in reciprocal space) of their underlying complex amplitudes.|$|R

When a substrate voltage difference is changed and the diffraction grating length in each of one or two directions is thereby changed, {{at least one of the}} diffraction angle, the diffraction order and the central wavelength is controllably changed. A <b>diffracted</b> light beam <b>component,</b> having a given wavelength, diffraction angle and diffraction order, that is initially received at a first light receiving site (e. g., a detector or optical fiber) is thereby controllably shifted or altered and can be received at a second light receiving site.
