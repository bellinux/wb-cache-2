25|$|Mercurial, clever, {{and always}} {{a few steps}} ahead of his enemies, at times {{he could be a}} calculating schemer who would not only {{manipulate}} people for the greater good but act like a bumbling <b>fool</b> <b>to</b> have others underestimate his true abilities. Sometimes this appears simply as a joke, such as in The Tomb of the Cybermen, where he finishes the archaeologists' calculations behind their backs, but at other times, it seems much darker. In The Evil of the Daleks he coldly manipulates Jamie into trying to rescue Victoria (thus setting in motion the Human Factor tests) and is unsympathetic when Edward Waterfield tries to apologise for his collaboration with the Daleks. Despite the bluster and tendency to panic when events got out of control, the Second Doctor always acted heroically and morally in his desire to help the oppressed.|$|E
25|$|Ipomadon {{travels the}} world, {{fighting}} in tournaments, becomes King of Apulia following his father's death, and hears {{one day that}} the Proud is being besieged in her city by a knight called Lyoline. This ugly knight is threatening to take her away with him to India. Ipomadon {{makes his way to}} King Maleager's court once again, just in time to witness the arrival of the Proud's messenger, begging for some assistance for her lady. But curiously, Ipomadon has chosen to arrive at King Maleager's court {{in such a way that}} he is not recognised, not even by the queen. He pretends to be a fool, and the reader (or listener) is treated to a comic scene in which the fool Ipomadon is first ridiculed and then accepted by the knights and noblemen, little knowing who he really is. Cabanus is conveniently absent from court on this occasion. The maiden who has been sent as a messenger by the Proud is mightily unimpressed that a fool should wish to take on the challenge, but since nobody else in the court seems at all inclined to offer their services, the king allows Ipomadon the <b>fool</b> <b>to</b> take it up.|$|E

500|$|Hamlet-like legends are {{so widely}} found (for example in Italy, Spain, Scandinavia, Byzantium, and Arabia) {{that the core}} [...] "hero-as-fool" [...] theme is {{possibly}} Indo-European in origin. Several ancient written precursors to Hamlet can be identified. The first is the anonymous Scandinavian Saga of Hrolf Kraki. In this, the murdered king has two sons—Hroar and Helgi—who {{spend most of the}} story in disguise, under false names, rather than feigning madness, in a sequence of events that differs from Shakespeare's. The second is the Roman legend of Brutus, recorded in two separate Latin works. Its hero, Lucius ("shining, light"), changes his name and persona to Brutus ("dull, stupid"), playing the role of a <b>fool</b> <b>to</b> avoid the fate of his father and brothers, and eventually slaying his family's killer, King Tarquinius. A 17th-century Nordic scholar, Torfaeus, compared the Icelandic hero Amlodi and the Spanish hero Prince Ambales (from the Ambales Saga) to Shakespeare's Hamlet. Similarities include the prince's feigned madness, his accidental killing of the king's counsellor in his mother's bedroom, and the eventual slaying of his uncle.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} {{also had}} a brief sexual relationship with hospital Lothario Sam Strachan. She and Sam had a one night stand in episode [...] "The Borders of Sleep", {{and went on to}} become close friends, with Maddy assisting Sam in caring for a teenage prostitute he felt responsible for. She also supported him through his Non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis, and enlisting his support in illegally proving a patient's death through negligence. In the show's tenth series, Maddy also formed a fast respect for the new head of the hospital's Acute Assessment Unit, Linden Cullen (Duncan Pow). Pow ruled out a romance between the two characters, however, stating: [...] "They're protective of each other, but they're more like brother and sister than anything else. I don't think he's ready for the relationship merry-go-round at Holby just yet". He added that: [...] "Any man would be a <b>fool</b> <b>to</b> turn down Maddy, but Linden wants his wife back". Similarly, Lewington has assessed that neither Sam nor Linden are Maddy's ideal man, and instead she is [...] "waiting for a new hunk!" ...|$|E

500|$|Act II {{begins with}} Midas enamored {{with his new}} power of turning things to gold. However, his courtiers {{complain}} of being forced to wear heavy golden clothing. Midas rebukes them, saying [...] "I am a God!". But Midas himself begins to experience the problems of turning everything he touches to gold: he cannot eat, for example. He starts to regret his wish, saying [...] "Oh! <b>fool!</b> <b>to</b> wish to change all things to gold! / Blind Ideot that I was!". Midas prays to Bacchus to take away his power, begging [...] "Make me a hind, clothe me in ragged skins— / And let my food be bread, unsavoury roots, / But take from me the frightful curse of gold". Midas has his courtiers sacrifice to the gods {{to see if he}} can be relieved of his curse; Bacchus relents and tells him to bathe in the river. The courtiers find it strange that he does not remove his crown while he swims; one of them resolves to peek under his crown while he is sleeping. Returning from his swim, Midas celebrates nature, saying gold [...] "is a sordid, base and dirty thing;— / Look at the grass, the sky, the trees, the flowers, / These are Joves treasures & they are not gold".|$|E
500|$|Sinatra's {{split with}} Gardner {{in the fall}} of 1953 had a {{profound}} impact on the types of songs he sang and his voice. He began to console himself in songs with a [...] "brooding melancholy", such as [...] "I'm a <b>Fool</b> <b>to</b> Want You", [...] "Don't Worry 'Bout Me", [...] "My One and Only Love" [...] and There Will Never Be Another You", which Riddle believed was the direct influence of Ava Gardner. Lahr comments that the new Sinatra was [...] "not the gentle boy balladeer of the forties. Fragility had gone from his voice, to be replaced by a virile adult's sense of happiness and hurt". Author Granata considered Sinatra to have been a [...] "master of the art of recording", noting that his work in the studio [...] "set him apart from other gifted vocalists". During his career he made over 1000 recordings. Recording sessions would typically last three hours, though Sinatra would always prepare for it by spending at least an hour by the piano beforehand to vocalize, followed by a short rehearsal with the orchestra to ensure the balance of sound. During his Columbia years Sinatra would use an RCA 44 microphone, which Granata describes as [...] "the 'old-fashioned' microphone which is closely associated with Sinatra's crooner image of the 1940s", though when performing on talk shows later he would use a bullet-shaped RCA 77. At Capitol he used a Neumann U47, an [...] "ultra-sensitive" [...] microphone which better captured the timbre and tone of his voice.|$|E
500|$|... "Nothin' on You" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} most music critics. Billboards Evan J. Nabavian gave the song a 4 out of 5 starts, denoting that the song explores the swell appeal [...] "between Mars' delicately delivered melodies and B.o.B.'s Southern twang." [...] He {{compared it to}} Lupe Fiasco's duet with Matthew Santos' [...] "Superstar" [...] (2007), [...] "especially its feel-good, singalong hook". The review concluded with positive feedback for the recording's lyrics and references. The same rating was give by Nick Levine of Digital Spy. He called the track a [...] "smash" [...] and praised its piano and hook. Levine concluded that although it doesn't show the same class as [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] (2009) by Jay Z and Alicia Keys, [...] "it's all so goddamn catchy you'd be a <b>fool</b> <b>to</b> give a hoot." [...] Lee Tyler from Blues & Souls awarded the single 8 out of 10 stars, calling it a [...] "delight" [...] from its beginning until the end. He said [...] "Whilst not being content to just please the ear... seems to laden with instant charisma, stopping only to refresh the parts others cannot reach of late". Tyler opined that it wouldn't surprise him if Gym Class Heroes sang the track, [...] "is sweet in it's up lifting melody, while giving the rapper {{plenty of room to}} flex his prowess." [...] Richard of DJBooth enhanced the way B.o.B. [...] "drops lovestruck bars as agile as they are flattering," [...] and the [...] "silky-smooth bridge and chorus" [...] Mars uses to seduce [...] "the woman in question". Angus Batey thought the song would have stuck out in 2010, even without B.o.B's verses, since is a clear departure from the [...] "in-the-club, eyeing-up-the-booty cliches that have come to pass for romance in hip-hop".|$|E

And the way Armin defines the two is important: the character Jack Oates is a true fool natural.

The director briefly considered Gene Hackman, Robin Williams, Gary Oldman and Tommy Lee Jones. Stone met with Warren Beatty but the actor wanted to make too many changes to the script. Stone cast Hopkins based on his performances in The Remains of the Day and Shadowlands. Of Hopkins, Stone said, [...] "The isolation of Tony is what struck me. The loneliness.

2500|$|Huey Freeman (voiced by Regina King) – [...] 10-year-old Huey Freeman is the family's {{moral compass}} and voice of reason. He is an intelligent, wise-beyond-his-years avid reader who is {{knowledgeable}} about {{a variety of}} subjects. He is heavily influenced by the theories of various left-wing social movements and social justice leaders. His brother and grandfather constantly ridicule and underestimate him, thinking he is a <b>fool</b> <b>to</b> have goals and values that aim higher than the expectations of mainstream American culture. It's mentioned {{that he has been}} declared a [...] "domestic terrorist". While he promotes various social causes, he is openly contemptuous of Urban Gangster Rap/Hip Hop as portrayed in mainstream media for glamorizing wasteful extravagance, self-defeating lifestyles, and ignorance. Huey, unlike the other characters, rarely smiles; in the episode [...] "Let's Nab Oprah" [...] he smiles after his duel with Riley; he also smiles when Riley begins to win basketball games in [...] "Ballin'".

2500|$|He {{points out}} that if a wager was between the equal chance of gaining two lifetimes of {{happiness}} and gaining nothing, then a person would be a <b>fool</b> <b>to</b> bet on the latter. The same would go if it was three lifetimes of happiness versus nothing. He then argues that it is simply unconscionable by comparison to bet against an eternal life of happiness {{for the possibility of}} gaining nothing. The wise decision is to wager that God exists, since [...] "If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing", meaning one can gain eternal life if God exists, but if not, one will be no worse off in death than if one had not believed. On the other hand, if you bet against God, win or lose, you either gain nothing or lose everything. You are either unavoidably annihilated (in which case, nothing matters one way or the other) or lose the opportunity of eternal happiness. In note 194, speaking about those who live apathetically betting against God, he sums up by remarking, [...] "It is to the glory of religion to have for enemies men so unreasonable..." ...|$|E
