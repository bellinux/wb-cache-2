500|$|Parents Television Council founder L. Brent Bozell III and Action for Children's Television founder Peggy Charren {{have both}} {{condemned}} the show, {{with the latter}} claiming it is [...] "dangerous to the democracy". Several other activist groups have protested the show's parodies of Christianity and portrayal of Jesus Christ. Stone claims that parents who disapprove of South Park for its portrayal of how kids behave are upset because they [...] "have an idyllic vision of what kids are like", adding [...] " [...] don't <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> of social tact or etiquette, they're just complete little raging bastards".|$|E
500|$|We had a {{marvelous}} antagonist, so omnipotent {{that for us}} to defeat it or even communicate with it, or <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> of relationship with it, made the initial concept of the story false. Here's this gigantic machine that's a million years further advanced than we are. Now, how the hell can we possibly deal with this? On what level? As the story developed, everything worked until the very end. How do you resolve this thing? If humans can defeat this marvelous machine, [...] it's really not so great, is it? Or if it really is great, will we like those humans who do defeat it? Should they defeat it? Who is the story's hero anyway? That was the problem. We experimented {{with all kinds of}} approaches...we didn't {{know what to do with}} the ending. We always ended up against a blank wall.|$|E
500|$|Treehouse of Horror episodes {{typically}} {{consist of}} four parts: an opening and Halloween-themed {{version of the}} credits, followed by three segments. These segments usually have a horror, science fiction or fantasy theme and quite often are parodies of films, novels, plays, television shows, Twilight Zone episodes, or old issues of EC Comics. Although they are sometimes connected by [...] "wraparounds", the three segments rarely <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> of continuing connection within the episode. The two exceptions are [...] "Treehouse of Horror V", in which Groundskeeper Willie is killed by an axe {{in a similar fashion}} in all three segments, as well as in Treehouse of Horror XXVIII, in which Maggie is possessed by the demon Pazuzu in the first segment and is still recovering in the next segment. The episodes are considered to be non-canon and always take place outside the normal continuity of the show.|$|E

500|$|On 24 April 1976, McCartney and Lennon were {{watching}} {{an episode of}} Saturday Night Live together at Lennon's home in the Dakota, when Lorne Michaels made a $3,000 cash offer for the Beatles to reunite. While they seriously considered going to the SNL studio a few blocks away, they decided it was too late. This was their last time together. VH1 fictionalised this event in the 2000 television film Two of Us. McCartney's last telephone call to Lennon, days before Lennon and Ono released Double Fantasy, was friendly; he said this about the call: [...] " [...] a consoling factor for me, because I do feel it was sad that we never actually sat down and straightened our differences out. But fortunately for me, the last phone conversation I ever had with him was really great, and we didn't <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> of blow-up." ...|$|E
500|$|Cartman is {{partially}} named after {{and based on}} Matt Karpman, a high school classmate of Parker who remains a friend of both Parker and Stone. Cartman is also inspired by All in the Family patriarch Archie Bunker, who is himself inspired by Alf Garnett from Till Death Us Do Part, the original British version of All in the Family. Parker and Stone are big fans of All in the Family. They state that creating Cartman as a [...] "little eight-year-old fat kid" [...] {{made it easier for}} the two to portray a Bunker-like character after the introduction of political correctness to late-20th century television. While developing the character, Parker noted that everyone either remembers [...] "an annoying fat kid in their pasts", or [...] "they were the annoying fat kid". Stone has observed that [...] "kids are not nice, innocent, flower-loving little rainbow children [...] they don't <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> of social tact or etiquette, they're just complete little raging bastards".|$|E

[...] He wrote every weekday, from [...] to , without taking breaks.|$|E
2500|$|US Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairman Gregory Jaczko, visiting Japan, {{confirmed}} that the Daiichi reactors were stable. [...] Said Jaczko, [...] "The temperatures have decreased significantly, the amount of heat that's being produced from the reactor fuel itself is very, very low now. [...] So it simply doesn't {{have the kind of}} energy, if you will, that's needed to <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> of off-site releases of radiation. [...] I feel very comfortable with the (government's cold shutdown) decision." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Christian Science Monitor {{reported}} that the censorship has made more academics in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia grow uneasy with Confucius Institutes. Eamonn Fingleton suggests that perhaps the most embarrassing aspect of the whole Braga Incident is that Beijing has reversed itself on the [...] "hot-button issue {{at the center of}} the entire controversy. After vehemently denying for years that the Confucius Institutes <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> of censorship agenda, Beijing has now tacitly acknowledged that this was false." ...|$|E

2500|$|Judaism has {{traditionally}} taught that God is omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent. Yet, these claims are in jarring {{contrast with the}} fact that there is much evil in the world. Perhaps the most difficult question that monotheists have confronted is [...] "how can one reconcile the existence of this view of God with the existence of evil?" [...] or [...] "how can there be good without bad?" [...] "how can there be a God without a devil?" [...] This is the problem of evil. [...] Within all monotheistic faiths many answers (theodicies) have been proposed. [...] However, in light of the magnitude of evil seen in the Holocaust, many people have re-examined classical views on this subject. How can people still <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> of faith after the Holocaust? [...] This set of Jewish philosophies is discussed in the article on Holocaust theology.|$|E
2500|$|Obesity {{prevalence}} {{is affected}} by access to care for truckers. Company drivers often have issues with insurance, such as necessary pre-approval if out of network. Most owner-operator drivers do not <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> of medical insurance (that is, in the USA where medical treatment isn't free of charge like most countries). [...] Moreover, truckers have difficulties making an appointment {{on the road and}} often do not know where to stop for assistance. Many self-diagnose or ignore their health issue altogether. [...] Some are able to be seen at doctor’s offices or private clinics while a large percentage depend on emergency rooms and urgent care visits. The Department of Transportation has Convenient Care Clinics across the U.S., but those are hard to find and are few and far between. Health care costs are substantially higher for overweight and obese individuals, so obesity in the truck driver population puts a greater financial demand on the industry.|$|E
2500|$|Parker and Neal worked {{together}} to promote Presley, using their own Hank Snow Tour to book him and tour him. Although Neal remained Presley's official manager, Parker was becoming increasingly involved in the running of his career, and {{by the summer of}} 1955 he had become Presley's [...] "special advisor." [...] As Presley was still a minor, his parents had to sign the contract with Parker on his behalf. Part of Parker's role was to secure a new recording contract with a bigger label. Presley had been at Sun Records since the beginning of his career, but Sam Phillips, the owner of Presley's current label, was aware that for Presley to <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> of a successful future in the business he would need the backing of a much larger label. Despite this, Phillips was not keen to let him go easily, advising Parker that he would require $40,000 to secure the release of Presley's contract, a completely unheard-of sum at the time.|$|E

[...] He also described the Israeli public as focused on a mistaken policy that he considers to be [...] "appeasement".|$|R

2500|$|Both leaders, Massoud and Haq, were {{recognized}} for being fiercely independent from foreign, especially Pakistani, influence. Both, {{two of the}} most successful anti-Soviet resistance leaders, were rejecting the Pakistani claim of hegemony over the Afghan mujahideen. Abdul Haq was quoted as saying during the anti-Soviet period: [...] "How is that we Afghans, who never lost a war, must take military instructions from the Pakistanis, who never won one?" [...] Massoud during the Soviet period said to the Pakistani Foreign Minister who had asked him {{to send a message to}} the Russians through the Pakistanis who were conducting talks [...] "on behalf of our Afghan brethren": [...] "Why should I send a message? Why are you talking on our behalf? Don't we have leaders here to talk on our behalf?" [...] Khan replied [...] "This is how it has been and how it will be. Do you have a message?" [...] Massoud told the foreign minister that [...] "nobody who talks on our behalf will <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> of result." [...] Consequently, neither Massoud nor Abdul Haq were consulted before and neither participated in the Battle of Jalalabad (1989) in which the ISI tried but failed to install Gulbuddin Hekmatyar as the post-communist leader of Afghanistan.|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Bungle emerged {{after its}} members were kicked out their {{respective}} bands. [...] "It was kinda like a merger between two bands," [...] Mike Patton recalled. [...] "One really horrible gothic metal band, which our guitarist and original drummer were in, and one really horrible metal band which did Metallica covers, {{which is the}} one Trevor and me came from." [...] Mr. Bungle initially described themselves as a death metal band, but also dabbled in speed metal, thrash metal, and hardcore punk. And {{within a year of}} formation, the band expanded their sound to include ska. Trevor Dunn noted that, [...] "After about a year we got tired of playing speed metal and wanted to do something a little more creative. So we just stopped and started writing our own style of music, which was influenced by bands like Camper Van Beethoven, Oingo Boingo, Bad Manners and kind of ska funk-ish oriented stuff. Then we added a two-piece horn section and a new drummer, so now we don't really <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> of limit on the music we play." [...] Trey Spruance corroborated this. “When I was 15, I was in a death metal group," [...] Spruance reminisced. [...] "We had this idea {{that we were going to}} play a bunch of ska tunes for a bunch of metalheads. We just had this idea, you know: ‘Okay, we’re going to play this ska music, and that’ll be amazing.’ Half of the audience hated us, but there was definitely a joy in confronting that wall between styles.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his review}} for Screen Crush, Kevin Fitzpatrick stated, [...] "The honest {{truth is that}} Iron Fist needed {{to be so much}} weirder than it {{actually}} is, akin to how Doctor Strange essentially re-told the Iron Man story with enough out-there visuals and eccentric supporting characters to paper over any shortcomings. Iron Fist starts to show signs of life in its sixth episode... but the slog in getting there is too great an ask, especially when {{the vast majority of the}} principal characters feel so spectacularly underdeveloped." [...] Fitzpatrick felt that Henwick's Colleen Wing was [...] "the most fully-realized character" [...] with [...] "a rich supporting performance" [...] that is overlooked in the early episodes. Uproxx's Alan Sepinwall felt of the first six episodes, [...] "Iron Fist is virtually all talk — most of it painfully dull — and the fighting is both brief and unconvincing. It’s easily the worst of the Netflix Marvel shows — where the others tend to start off well and then run into massive pacing problems around episode 8 or 9, Iron Fist begins as if it’s already at that sag point — and an unfortunate illustration of the perils of miscasting." [...] He also criticized Jones' fighting ability and the way the fights were filmed and edited. Some of the few positive for the season were the appearances of Carrie-Anne Moss as Jeri Hogarth and Dawson. Sepinwall concluded, [...] "the biggest problem with the new show is that no one involved seems to <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> of take on the material. They’re just making a mostly faithful but personality-free adaptation because someone at Marvel decided four years ago that Danny (who often partners with Luke in the comics) had to be the final member of the team... we got a show that’s so lifeless that I have no interest in finishing out the season".|$|E
5000|$|We thought that's the way movies were. That {{they were}} that joyous an experience.
