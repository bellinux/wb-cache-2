Motor complications in Parkinson's disease (PD) result from the short half-life and irregular plasma fluctuations of oral levodopa. When strategies of providing more continuous dopaminergic stimulation by adjusting oral medication fail, patients may be candidates for one of three device-aided therapies: {{deep brain stimulation}} (DBS), continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion, or continuous duodenal/jejunal levodopa/carbidopa pump <b>infusion</b> (DLI). These <b>therapies</b> differ in their invasiveness, side-effect profile, {{and the need for}} nursing care. So far, very few comparative studies have evaluated the efficacy of the three device-aided therapies for specific motor problems in advanced PD. As a result, neurologists currently lack guidance as to which therapy could be most appropriate for a particular PD patient.

In the healthy brain, dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta fire tonically at a steady rate of about 4 cycles/second.

Patients disconnect their insulin pumps from their infusion sets when showering, swimming, exercising, or during intimate moments. Interrupting insulin infusion results in cessation of the basal insulin delivery. Nineteen subjects with T 1 DM were studied on 2 separate in-clinic days. One hour after arriving at the clinic in a fasting state, subjects either temporarily disconnected their infusion sets from their pumps, interrupting basal insulin infusion for 30 minutes, or on a separate day, only changed their infusion sets. Glucose levels were monitored for an additional 4 hours on both occasions. Changing infusion sets did not affect short-term glucose control.

40|$|Parkinson’s {{disease is}} {{characterized}} by the progression of the disease from the early stages where it still has little functional consequence for afflicted patients, to an advanced stage disease with large consequences in terms of function, quality of life and individual and societal costs. Motor fluctuations and symptoms of levodopa overdosage may occur in parallel with increasing Parkinsonian symptoms. This leads to a narrower therapeutic window which causes problems with traditional oral medication. Various ways of optimizing oral treatment should be tried but often have limited effects. In addition to the previous alternatives of neurosurgery (especially deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nuclei) and continuous apomorphine treatment there is now also the alternative of continuous enteral levodopa administration via a trans-abdominal tube. The effect of the treatment may be tested individually via naso-duodenal administration before a decision is made whether to continue with permanent treatment. In the present article, the challenges to treatment of Parkinson’s disease in these phases are described as well as the various treatment alternatives available.

40|$|AbstractLysosomal storage {{diseases}} arise {{because of}} genetic mutations {{that result in}} nonfunctioning or dysfunctional lysosomal enzymes responsible for breaking down molecules such as glycosaminoglycans or glycogen. Many of these storage diseases, such as the mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) disorders and Pompe disease, can now be treated with <b>infusion</b> <b>therapies</b> to replace the dysfunctional protein with active enzyme. Although these therapies are effective, {{in at least one}} condition, infantile-onset Pompe disease, antibodies that develop against the drug significantly reduce its efficacy. However, this influence on efficacy does not appear to manifest across all enzyme replacement therapies. An example is MPS IVA, or Morquio A syndrome, in which the glycosaminoglycans keratan sulfate and chondroitin- 6 -sulfate accumulate in tissues as a result of N-acetylgalactosamine- 6 -sulfatase deficiency. The current approved treatment for MPS IVA is elosulfase alfa, a recombinant human enzyme replacement therapy. Although all patients receiving elosulfase alfa treatment develop antidrug antibodies and most develop neutralizing antibodies, clinical data to date show no effect on drug efficacy or safety. Overall, the relevance of antidrug antibodies specific to enzyme replacement therapies for the lysosomal storage diseases remains a mixed picture that will require time and continued clinical follow-up to resolve for each specific condition and treatment...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSkin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs) are {{a common}} {{indication}} for antibiotic use in Europe and are associated with considerable morbidity. Treatment of SSTIs, occasionally complicated by infection with meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, can be resource intensive and lead to high healthcare costs. For patients treated in an inpatient setting, once the acute infection has been controlled, a patient may be discharged on suitable oral antibiotic therapy or outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy. The recently confirmed efficacy of single-dose (e. g. oritavancin) and two-dose (e. g. dalbavancin) <b>infusion</b> <b>therapies</b> as well as tedizolid phosphate, a short-duration therapy available both for intravenous (i. v.) and oral use, for treating SSTIs has highlighted the need for clinicians to re-evaluate their current treatment paradigms.

The aim {{of this paper is}} to review the potential impact of assessing clinical response on clinical decision-making in the management of SSTIs in Europe, with a focus on emerging therapies...|$|R
