5|$|In November 2012 Transport for London (TfL) {{presented}} {{a proposal to}} abolish the Greener Vehicle <b>Discount</b> that benefited, among others, vehicles with small diesel engines that avoid the charge because their engines produce emissions of less than 100g per km of CO2.

The ULED introduced more stringent emission standards that limit the free access to the congestion charge zone to all-electric cars, some plug-in hybrids, and any car or van that emits 75g/km or less of CO2 and meets the Euro 5 emission standards for air quality. The measure was designed to curb {{the growing number of}} diesel vehicles on London's roads.

40|$|Sixty college {{students}} performed three <b>discounting</b> tasks: probability <b>discounting</b> 					of gains, probability <b>discounting</b> of losses, and delay <b>discounting</b> of gains. 					Each task used an adjusting-amount procedure, and participants' choices affected 					the amount {{and timing of}} their remuneration for participating. Both group and 					individual <b>discounting</b> functions from all three procedures were well fitted by 					hyperboloid <b>discounting</b> functions. A negative correlation between the 					probability <b>discounting</b> of gains and losses was observed, consistent with the 					idea that individuals' choices on probability <b>discounting</b> tasks reflect their 					general attitude towards risk, {{regardless of whether the}} outcomes are gains or 					losses. This finding further suggests that risk attitudes reflect the weighting 					an individual gives to the lowest-valued outcome (e. g., getting nothing when the 					probabilistic outcome is a gain or actually losing when the probabilistic 					outcome is a loss). According to this view, risk-aversion indicates a tendency 					to overweight the lowest-valued outcome, whereas risk-seeking indicates a 					tendency to underweight it.

40|$|Abstract Background Hyperbolic <b>discounting</b> of delayed and {{probabilistic}} outcomes {{has drawn}} attention in psychopharmacology and neuroeconomics. Sozou's evolutionary theory proposed that hyperbolic delay <b>discounting</b> may be totally attributable to aversion to {{a decrease in}} subjective probability of obtaining delayed rewards (SP) which follows a hyperbolic decay function. However, to date, no empirical study examined the hypothesis, although this investigation is important for elucidating the roles of impatience, precaution, and uncertainty aversion in delay <b>discounting</b> processes. Methods In order to (i) determine the functional form {{of the relation between}} delay until receipt and SP, and (ii) examine whether delay <b>discounting</b> is attributable to a decrease in SP, we assessed the subjects' SP and their delay and probability <b>discounting.</b> We examined the fitness of hyperbolic and exponential functions to the assessed SP, and relations between the SP, and delay/probability <b>discounting,</b> and subjective-probability <b>discounting</b> for delayed rewards. Results The results demonstrated (a) SP decayed hyperbolically as delay increases, (b) a decay of SP was associated with delay <b>discounting,</b> and (c) subjective-probability <b>discounting</b> did not significantly correlate with delay <b>discounting.</b> Conclusion Our results demonstrated (i) hyperbolic decay of SP is related to delay <b>discounting,</b> and (ii) delay <b>discounting</b> is, however, not attributable to precautious foresight in intertemporal choice. Further, a novel parameter of pure time preference is proposed. </p...|$|R

5|$|The {{equilibrium}} {{that results}} from the relationship between forward and spot exchange rates {{within the context of}} covered interest rate parity is responsible for eliminating or correcting for market inefficiencies that would create potential for arbitrage profits. As such, arbitrage opportunities are fleeting. In order for this equilibrium to hold under differences in interest rates between two countries, the forward exchange rate must generally differ from the spot exchange rate, such that a no-arbitrage condition is sustained. Therefore, the forward rate is said to contain a premium or <b>discount,</b> reflecting the interest rate differential between two countries. The following equations demonstrate how the forward premium or <b>discount</b> is calculated.|$|E
