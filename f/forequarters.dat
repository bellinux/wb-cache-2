The animals, belonging to four genetic groups (Nellore, ½ Guzerath + ½ Nellore (½ G + ½ N), ½ Red Angus + ½ Nellore (½ R + ½ N) and ½ Marchigiana + ½ Nellore (½ M + ½ N)), were raised on pastures, finished in dry lot and slaughtered at live weights ranging from 445 to 517 kg, and at ages ranging from 679 to 863 days. During the dry lot period, which lasted 114 days, animals were fed sorghum silage offered ad libitum, and a concentrate (13. 5 MJ of ME, 18 % CP in the DM) at 1 % live weight per day. Genetic group influenced hot carcass weight, <b>forequarter</b> weight, meat weight in the spare ribs, as well as meat and bone weights in the <b>forequarter.</b> Animals in the ½ M + ½ N group were superior both {{to those in the}} Nellore and in the ½ G + ½ N groups for hot carcass weight, <b>forequarter</b> weight and meat weight in the spare ribs.

5|$|Pinnipeds {{themselves}} {{are subject to}} predation. Most species are preyed on by the killer whale or orca. To subdue and kill seals, orcas continuously ram them with their heads, slap them with their tails and fling them in the air. They are typically hunted by groups of 10 or fewer whales, but they are occasionally hunted by larger groups or by lone individuals. Pups are more commonly taken by orcas, but adults can be targeted as well. Large sharks are another major predator of pinnipeds—usually the great white shark but also the tiger shark and mako shark. Sharks usually attack by ambushing them from below. The prey usually escapes, and seals are often seen with shark-inflicted wounds. Otariids typically have injuries in the hindquarters, while phocids usually have injuries on the <b>forequarters.</b>|$|E

Presentation of case: We present a patient with recurrent breast cancer who had a complicated treatment history including multiple courses of chemotherapy, radiation, and local surgical excision. With diminishing treatment options, she opted for a <b>forequarter</b> amputation {{in an attempt to}} limit the spread of cancer. Discussion: In our patient the <b>forequarter</b> amputation was utilized as a last resort to slow disease progression after she had failed multiple rounds of chemotherapy and received maximal radiation. Unfortunately, while she had symptomatic relief in the short-term, she had cutaneous recurrence of metastatic adenocarcinoma within 2 months of the procedure. In comparing this case with other reported <b>forequarter</b> amputations, patients with non-metastatic disease showed a mean survival of approximately two years. Furthermore, among patients who had significant pain prior to surgery, all patients reported pain relief, indicating a significant palliative benefit. This seems to indicate that our patient’s unfortunate outcome was anomalous compared to that of most patients undergoing <b>forequarter</b> amputation for recurrent breast cancer. Conclusion: <b>Forequarter</b> amputation can be judiciously used for patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. Patients with recurrent disease without evidence of distant metastases may be considered for curative amputation, while others may receive palliative benefit; disappointingly our patient achieved neither of these outcomes.

25|$|Though {{capable of}} sprinting, the cougar is {{typically}} an ambush predator. It stalks through brush and trees, across ledges, or other covered spots, before delivering a powerful leap {{onto the back}} of its prey and a suffocating neck bite. The cougar is capable of breaking the neck of some of its smaller prey with a strong bite and momentum bearing the animal to the ground. The head of the cat is round and the ears are erect. Its powerful <b>forequarters,</b> neck, and jaw serve to grasp and hold large prey. It has five retractable claws on its forepaws (one a dewclaw) and four on its hind paws.

500|$|Another {{reference}} {{appeared with}} the term pes hippocampi, which may date back to Diemerbroeck in 1672, introducing a comparison with {{the shape of the}} folded back forelimbs and webbed feet of the mythological hippocampus, a sea monster with a horse's <b>forequarters</b> and a fish's tail. The hippocampus was then described as pes hippocampi major, with an adjacent bulge in the occipital horn, described as the pes hippocampi minor and later renamed as the calcar avis. The renaming of the hippocampus as hippocampus major, and the calcar avis as hippocampus minor, has been attributed to Félix Vicq-d'Azyr systematising nomenclature of parts of the brain in 1786. [...] Mayer mistakenly used the term hippopotamus in 1779, and was followed by some other authors until Karl Friedrich Burdach resolved this error in 1829. In 1861 the hippocampus minor became the centre of a dispute over human evolution between Thomas Henry Huxley and Richard Owen, satirised as the Great Hippocampus Question. The term hippocampus minor fell from use in anatomy textbooks, and was officially removed in the Nomina Anatomica of 1895. Today, the structure is just called the hippocampus, {{with the term}} Cornu Ammonis surviving in the names of the hippocampal subfields CA1–CA4.|$|E
500|$|The {{spotted hyena}} {{has a strong}} and well {{developed}} neck and <b>forequarters,</b> but relatively underdeveloped hindquarters. The rump is rounded rather than angular, which prevents attackers coming from behind from getting {{a firm grip on}} it. The head is wide and flat with a blunt muzzle and broad rhinarium. In contrast to the striped hyena, the ears of the spotted hyena are rounded rather than pointed. Each foot has four digits, which are webbed and armed with short, stout and blunt claws. The paw-pads are broad and very flat, with the whole undersurface of the foot around them being naked. The tail is relatively short, being [...] long, and resembles a pompom in appearance. Unusually among hyaenids, and mammals in general, the female spotted hyena is considerably larger than the male. Both sexes have a pair of anal glands which open into the rectum just inside the anal opening. These glands produce a white, creamy secretion which is pasted onto grass stalks by everting the rectum. The odour of this secretion is very strong, smelling of boiling cheap soap or burning, and can be detected by humans several metres downwind. The spotted hyena has a proportionately large heart, constituting close to 1% of its body weight, thus giving it great endurance in long chases. In contrast, a lion's heart makes up only 0.45–0.57 percent of its body weight. The now extinct Eurasian populations were distinguished from the modern African populations by their shorter distal extremities and longer humerus and femur.|$|E
500|$|Both {{species of}} {{wildebeest}} are even-toed, horned, greyish-brown ungulates resembling cattle. Males {{are larger than}} females and both have heavy <b>forequarters</b> compared to their hindquarters. They have broad muzzles, Roman noses, shaggy manes and tails. The most striking morphological differences between the black and blue wildebeest are the orientation and curvature of their horns {{and the color of}} their coats. The blue wildebeest is the bigger of the two species. In males, blue wildebeest stand 150cm tall at the shoulder and weigh around 250kg, while the black wildebeest stands 111 to 120cm tall and weighs about 180kg. In females, blue wildebeest have a shoulder height of 135cm and weigh 180kg while black wildebeest females stand 108cm at the shoulder and weigh 155kg. The horns of blue wildebeest protrude to the side then curve downwards before curving up back towards the skull, while the horns of the black wildebeest curve forward then downward before curving upwards at the tips. Blue wildebeest tend to be a dark grey color with stripes, but may have a bluish sheen. The black wildebeest has brown-coloured hair, with a mane that ranges in color from cream to black, and a cream-coloured tail. The blue wildebeest lives {{in a wide variety of}} habitats, including woodlands and grasslands, while the black wildebeest tends to reside exclusively in open grassland areas. In some areas the blue wildebeest migrates over long distances in the winter, whereas the black wildebeest does not. The milk of the female black wildebeest contains a higher protein, lower fat, and lower lactose content than the milk of the blue wildebeest. [...] Wildebeest can live more than forty years, though their average lifespan is around twenty years.|$|E

60|$|The tale of {{our summer}} amusements would be sadly {{incomplete}} without some {{record of the}} bull-fights given by the Spanish prisoners of war on the neighboring island, where they were confined {{the year of the}} war. Admission to these could be had only by favor of the officers in charge, and even among the Elite of the colony those who went were a more elect few. Still, the day I went, there were some fifty or seventy-five spectators, who arrived by trolley near the island, and walked to the stockade which confined the captives. A real bull-fight, I believe, is always given on Sunday, and Puritan prejudice yielded to usage even {{in the case of a}} burlesque bull-fight; at any rate, it was on a Sunday that we crouched in an irregular semicircle on a rising ground within the prison pale, and faced the captive audience in another semicircle, across a little alley for the entrances and exits of the performers. The president of the bull-fight was first brought to the place of honor in a hand-cart, and then came the banderilleros, the picadores, and the espada, wonderfully effective and correct in white muslin and colored tissue-paper. Much may be done in personal decoration with advertising placards; and the lofty mural crown of the president urged the public on both sides to Use Plug Cut. The picador's pasteboard horse was attached to his middle, fore and aft, and looked quite the sort of hapless jade which is ordinarily sacrificed to the bulls. The toro himself was composed of two prisoners, whose horizontal backs were covered with a brown blanket; and his feet, sometimes bare and sometimes shod with india-rubber boots, were of the human pattern. Practicable horns, of a somewhat too yielding substance, branched from a front of pasteboard, and a cloth tail, apt to come off in the charge, swung from his rear. I have never seen a genuine corrida, but a lady present, who had, told me that this was conducted with all the right circumstance; and it is certain that the performers entered into their parts with the artistic gust of their race. The picador sustained some terrific falls, and in his quality of horse had to be taken out repeatedly and sewed up; the banderilleros tormented and eluded the toro with table-covers, one red and two drab, till the espada took him from them, and with due ceremony, after a speech to the president, drove his blade home to the bull's heart. I stayed to see three bulls killed; the last was uncommonly fierce, and when his hindquarters came off or out, his <b>forequarters</b> charged joyously among the aficionados on the prisoners' side, and made havoc in their thickly packed ranks.
