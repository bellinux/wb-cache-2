5|$|As {{a part of}} 42 Metrorail {{stations}}, Metro offers parking for commuters. Most lots are on a first-come, first-served {{basis and}} fill up quickly each day. Thirty-four stations offer reserved parking, with customers purchasing permits to park in specified spaces. Three Metrorail stations (Greenbelt, Huntington, and Franconia-Springfield) have spaces reserved for multi-day parking for up to ten days.

The high <b>fees</b> have <b>been</b> criticized as putting up one more wall to citizenship. Increases in fees for citizenship have drawn criticism. Doris Meissner, {{a senior fellow at}} the Migration Policy Institute and former Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner, doubted that fee increases deter citizenship-seekers. In 2009, the number of immigrants applying for citizenship plunged 62 percent; reasons cited were the slowing economy and the cost of naturalization.|$|R
50|$|The CLELCo's {{articles}} {{provided for}} a minimum of three and a maximum of ten directors. The original financial qualification was £1,000, and their <b>fee</b> <b>was</b> £3,000 per annum.

5|$|Financial Times {{questioned}} why the Japanese auditor firm {{signed off}} on the financial statements in the same year when other members of its global network apparently refused to give clean bills of financial heath to Olympus subsidiaries such as Gyrus in the UK, and elsewhere. One analyst suggests the poor performance of Japanese auditors may be due to low pay, and overwork due to the shortage of certified public accountants: audit <b>fees</b> <b>are</b> up to one-fifth of that of comparable US companies; there are 17,000 CPAs in Japan, compared with 330,000 in the US.|$|E
5|$|The College {{is almost}} entirely self-financed, {{and is not a}} {{recipient}} of any regular public funding. Its officers do have official salaries, which {{are paid for by the}} Crown. The salaries of the officers were raised during the reign of King James I, but were reduced under William IV. These salaries per annum reflected the living costs of the day; however today the amount is seen only as nominal payment. In addition to their official duties, the heralds have for many centuries undertaken private practice in heraldry and genealogy, for which professional <b>fees</b> <b>are</b> charged.|$|E
5000|$|A strong {{campaign}} {{developed in}} the late 1990s from {{a section of the}} public against the Broadcasting Fee. The reason behind the campaign was to prove [...] "whether the broadcasting <b>fee</b> <b>is</b> a tax and the legality of applying GST to this tax". In the end the <b>fee</b> <b>was</b> scrapped in 1999, and the Commission has since been directly funded by the government. The <b>fee</b> <b>was</b> collected from those people who owned a television set although the <b>fee</b> <b>was</b> funding much more than television work, especially radio. Some campaigners believed this was unfair.|$|R

5|$|The Scottish Parliament {{can give}} {{legislative}} consent over devolved matters {{back to the}} UK Parliament by passing a Legislative Consent Motion if United Kingdom-wide legislation is considered more appropriate for a certain issue. The programmes of legislation enacted by the Scottish Parliament have seen a divergence {{in the provision of}} public services compared {{to the rest of the}} UK. For instance, university education and care services for the elderly are free at point of use in Scotland, while <b>fees</b> <b>are</b> paid in the rest of the UK. Scotland was the first country in the UK to ban smoking in enclosed public places.|$|E
5|$|The {{contents}} of a storage unit are put up for auction if the rental <b>fees</b> <b>are</b> not paid for sixty days. Although the TV show Storage Wars created increased interest in the auctions, most units do not contain anything of substantial economic value. Sometimes auctioning the renter's property can result in disputes between Public Storage and the renter. In 2007, a customer's belongings were auctioned for non-payment while he was serving the US military in Iraq. After receiving negative publicity, Public Storage apologized and gave him $8,000 as compensation for his sold belongings.|$|E
5|$|All {{citizens}} of Canada, {{as well as}} corporate bodies, may petition the Crown for an award of arms. For an individual to obtain a grant of arms, a petition must {{be sent to the}} Chief Herald, providing a biography, references, and completed application forms. If the grant is approved, the individual then consults with heralds from the Authority to work out the design of their award. Upon completion of this process, the grant documents, in the form of letters patent, are created and provided to the grantee. The entire process is subject to certain fees required by the Government of Canada to cover costs of research and artwork; the <b>fees</b> <b>are</b> not to purchase the grant of arms. For corporations and institutions the process is similar.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to budget}} {{decreases}} and increased {{demands on the}} university, the UCF Board of Trustees, {{with the approval of}} the Board of Governors and the Florida Legislature, approved a 15% increase in tuition for the 2012–13 academic year. For the 2016-17 academic year, undergraduate tuition costs were $212.28 per credit hour for in-state students, and $748.89 per credit hour for out-of-state students. Graduate tuition costs were $369.65 per credit hour for in-state students, and $1,194.05 per credit hour for out-of-state students. Tuition for the medical school is $25,490 for both in-state and out-of-state students. Estimated annual cost for undergraduate students is $17,295 for Florida residents, and $33,392 for non-Florida residents. Expected costs for graduate students are $22,072 for in-state students, and $38,878 for out-of-state students. About 8% of tuition <b>fees</b> <b>are</b> allocated to support the university's athletic programs.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1960 as Grønlandsfly, {{the airline}} started its first {{services}} with Catalina water planes {{and within the}} decade expanded to include DHC-3 Otters as well as Sikorsky S-61 helicopters, some of which remain in active service. The majority of operations were based on helicopters until the newly established Greenland Home Rule began investing in a network of short takeoff and landing airfields. These were very expensive to construct and Greenland's airport <b>fees</b> <b>are</b> still {{among the highest in}} the world; they also required a new fleet: DHC-7 turboprops uniquely suited to the harsh terrain and weather conditions in Greenland. The reliability of connections improved as the domestic airport network expanded in the 1990s: increasing use of the Dash 7s made the airline less restricted by inclement weather. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Air Greenland acquired a Boeing 757 and an Airbus A330, allowing it to open connections to Copenhagen, until then operated by SAS which also competed mid to late 2000s. In the 21st century, it competes with Air Iceland for international connections and small charter services domestically.|$|E
5|$|Terminal 4 – {{originally}} {{called the}} Domestic Express or South Terminal – {{is dedicated to}} budget airlines and is the first facility of its kind at a conventional airport in Australia. It was originally constructed for Virgin Blue (Virgin Australia) and Impulse Airlines. Virgin Blue eventually moved into Terminal 3 following the demise of Ansett. A$5million refit began in June 2007 {{along the lines of}} the budget terminal model at Singapore Changi Airport and Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Lower landing and airport handling <b>fees</b> <b>are</b> charged to airlines due to the basic facilities, lack of jet bridges, and fewer amenities and retail outlets compared to a conventional terminal. However, the terminal is located next to the main terminal building, unlike in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. The terminal was rebuilt by Tiger Airways Australia, which has used it as its main hub since it operated its first domestic flight on 23 November 2007.|$|E
50|$|The {{admission}} <b>fee</b> <b>is</b> SR.500. In {{case of the}} student's name {{being struck}} off from the rolls, re-admission <b>fee</b> <b>is</b> SR.100. The school takes tuition fee, transport fee, laboratory fee and exam <b>fee</b> separately. Students <b>are</b> fined a big amount for misconduct.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes <b>fee</b> <b>is</b> used to mask {{what are}} {{actually}} penalties or taxes. For example, Virginia's now-repealed Civil Remedial <b>Fees</b> <b>were</b> actually {{a tax on}} drivers with certain kinds of traffic law violations.|$|R
50|$|The ABL {{program is}} {{promoting}} legislation in California to mandate a <b>fee</b> <b>be</b> collected {{every time a}} bike <b>is</b> purchased. That <b>fee</b> will <b>be</b> used to fund similar programs throughout California. The <b>fee</b> <b>is</b> a recycling <b>fee</b> similar to the legislated redemption value collected on beverage containers in California.|$|R
5|$|The Triangle Link is {{partially}} financed with tolls, with toll collection {{taking place at}} Føyno. It is constructed as a grade-separated intersection, such that any car passes through the plaza once. Cars driving along the E39 drive straight ahead through the plaza, while cars to or from Bømlo {{need to use the}} interchange. The toll station uses the Autopass toll collection, which allows passage without stopping, in addition to manual collection. Passengers, pedestrians, bicycles, motorcyclists and mopeds are free. As of 2011, the <b>fees</b> <b>are</b> NOK85 for cars and NOK270 for trucks. Frequent travelers can prepay for at least 40 passings to the toll company, and receive a 40 percent discount. It is estimated that the tunnel will be paid off and the tolls removed in 2012 or 2013.|$|E
5|$|The {{reference}} {{must state}} {{the questions on}} which the Tribunal's opinion is required in a form which allows, as far as possible, answers to be given in the affirmative or the negative. There must also be a concise statement of facts, and documents must be included, as are necessary to enable the Tribunal to decide the questions referred. During the hearing of a reference, the procedure in proceedings before the Court of Appeal applies. The President of Singapore is treated as the appellant and all other parties as respondents. However, the Tribunal is not bound by strict rules of evidence. The proceedings of the Tribunal, except for the hearing for directions, are held in open court. No party to any proceedings is ordered to pay any costs, and no court <b>fees</b> <b>are</b> payable in respect of any proceedings.|$|E
5|$|The tolls are {{collected}} at a toll plaza located on Føyno. The plaza is constructed as a grade-separated intersection, {{so that any}} car passes through the plaza once. However, traffic only traveling between Føyno to Bømlo {{does not have to}} pay. Cars driving along E39 drive straight ahead through the plaza, while cars to or from Bømlo need to use the interchange. There is also an intersection allowing access to the island. The plaza has six lanes, of which two in each direction have a toll booth and one in each direction has an automatic collection. The toll station uses the Autopass toll collection, which allows passage without stopping, in addition to manual collection. Passengers, pedestrians, bicycles, motorcyclists and mopeds are free. As of 2011, the <b>fees</b> <b>are</b> NOK85 for cars and NOK270 for trucks. Frequent travelers can prepay for at least 40 passings to the toll company, and receive a 40 percent discount.|$|E
