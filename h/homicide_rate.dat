40|$|Most {{previous}} empirical {{comparative studies}} of <b>homicide</b> examine <b>homicide</b> <b>rates</b> across nations or subnational units {{within a single}} country.

The article aims to provide insight into the extent that the <b>homicide</b> <b>rates</b> are related to the social and economic forces characterizing a sample of European cities. Derived from theories rooted in classic works, including social disorganization, strain, and urbanism, are six hypothesized effects of structural forces on <b>homicide</b> <b>rates.</b> Analyses show that cities’ deprivation and population structure indexes are strong predictors of <b>homicide</b> <b>rates.</b> The predicted effects of unemployment rates, population heterogeneity, and age structure on <b>homicide</b> <b>rates,</b> however, were not consistently corroborated by these results.

40|$|This study explores whether states {{adopting}} specific {{domestic violence}} laws have significantly {{lower rates of}} intimate partner and family homicide, {{as well as a}} lower average of the two <b>homicide</b> <b>rates.</b> Point biserial correlation and multiple regression were used to analyze <b>homicide</b> <b>rates,</b> as measures of domestic violence, across seven statutory categories of state domestic violence laws for 47 continental states in the United States. With two exceptions, data show that state laws on domestic violence were not related to intimate partner and family <b>homicide</b> <b>rates</b> by state, or the average of the two <b>homicide</b> <b>rates.</b> The exceptions were moderate, but significant inverse correlations were found between family homicide and the average of family homicide and intimate partner <b>homicide</b> <b>rates</b> and states prohibiting firearm possession during a restraining order.

40|$|Aims: To assess an {{empirical}} basis for cross-national and cross-cultural comparisons of four {{aspects of the}} association between alcohol consumption and homicide: the relative strength of the association, the fraction of <b>homicide</b> <b>rates</b> attributable to alcohol consumption, possible {{gender differences in the}} association between consumption and victim rates and possible variations in beverage-specific effects on <b>homicide</b> <b>rates.</b> Design, setting and participants: Time series analyses on differenced series of annual aggregate-level data on alcohol sales and <b>homicide</b> <b>rates</b> for the period 1950 - 95 were performed for each individual country. Estimates were pooled across countries within three regions of alleged differences in drinking pattern: southern Europe, central Europe and northern Europe. Findings: Total alcohol sales were positively and statistically significantly associated with <b>homicide</b> <b>rates</b> in five countries. Beer sales were positively and statistically significantly associated with <b>homicide</b> <b>rates</b> in four countries, wine sales in another two countries, and spirits sales in two countries. The effect of alcohol sales was stronger for male <b>homicide</b> <b>rates</b> than for female <b>homicide</b> <b>rates,</b> and the estimated fraction of homicides that could be attributed to alcohol consumption appeared to be of the same magnitude in the three regions. When estimates were pooled across countries, the strongest association between total sales and homicides was found in the northern European countries and the weakest, but still statistically significant, in the southern European countries. Pooled estimates showed that beer sales were positively and significantly associated with <b>homicide</b> <b>rates</b> in all three European regions, whereas wine sales were positively and moderately associated with <b>homicide</b> <b>rates</b> only in the traditional wine drinking cultures in southern Europe. Conclusion: The findings support the hypothesis that <b>homicide</b> <b>rates</b> are influenced by alcohol sales and more so in the northern European countries where the drinking culture is, to a larger extent, characterized by heavy drinking episodes. Moreover, the findings are suggestive of beverage-specific effects on violent behaviour being contingent upon characteristics of the drinking culture...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} comparative <b>homicide</b> <b>rates</b> in the United States and Western Europe {{in an era}} of increasingly globalized neoliberal economics. The main finding of this preliminary analysis is that historical and spatial correlations between distinct forms of political economy and <b>homicide</b> <b>rates</b> are consistent enough to suggest that social democratic regimes are more successful at fostering the socio-cultural conditions necessary for reduced <b>homicide</b> <b>rates.</b> Thus Western Europe and all continents and nations should approach the importation of American neo-liberal economic policies with extreme caution. The article concludes by suggesting that the indirect but crucial causal connection between political economy and <b>homicide</b> <b>rates,</b> prematurely pushed into the background of criminological thought during the ‘cultural turn’, should be returned to the foreground...|$|R

This homicide incident and neighborhood demographic data, which spans from 1998 - 2006, allow for a test of two theoretical perspectives within a classical/social control sphere, namely social disorganization and deterrence. This work poses two main questions: Do dynamic structural factors influence <b>homicide</b> <b>rates</b> across neighborhoods?

40|$|In {{the study}} of homicide, one common {{research}} finding is the strong association between urbanization and <b>homicide</b> <b>rates.</b> The strength of the association between urbanism and <b>homicide</b> <b>rates</b> should {{have led to a}} large body of research comparing rural and urban homicide, but it has not.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{presence}} of street gangs has been hypothesized as influencing overall levels {{of violence in}} urban communities {{through a process of}} gun–drug diffusion and crosstype homicide. This effect is said to act independently of other known correlates of violence, i. e., neighborhood poverty. To test this hypothesis, we independently assessed the impact of population exposure to local street gang densities on 8 -year <b>homicide</b> <b>rates</b> in small areas of Los Angeles County, California. Homicide data from the Los Angeles County Coroners Office were analyzed with original field survey data on street gang locations, while controlling for the established covariates of community <b>homicide</b> <b>rates.</b> Bivariate and multivariate regression analyses explicated strong relationships between <b>homicide</b> <b>rates,</b> gang density, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic structure. Street gang densities alone had cumulative effects on small area <b>homicide</b> <b>rates.</b> Local gang densities, along with high school dropout rates, high unemployment rates, racial and ethnic concentration, and higher population densities, together explained 90 % of the variation in local 8 -year <b>homicide</b> <b>rates.</b> Several other commonly considered covariates were insignificant in the model. Urban environments with higher densities of street gangs exhibited higher overall <b>homicide</b> <b>rates,</b> independent of other community covariates of homicide. The unique nature of street gang killings and their greater potential to influence future local rates of violence suggests that more direct public health interventions are needed alongside traditional criminal justice mechanisms to combat urban violence and homicides...|$|R
40|$|<b>Homicide</b> <b>rates</b> have {{remained}} consistently high in Chicago {{in spite of}} a nationwide downward trend in the past decades. This thesis examines the effects of public housing policy on <b>homicide</b> <b>rates</b> in Chicago in order {{to see whether or not}} the city's decision to demolish high-rise public housing projects had the intended effect of lowering <b>homicide</b> <b>rates.</b> This thesis applies game theory to build a model on expected actions of relocated gang members. Spatial and traditional analysis methods are used to analyze data to see if the game theoretic prediction holds true, and if the city's policy choices produced the desired effects. The data used in the thesis is compiled from crime statistics from the Chicago Police Department and population data from the U. S. Census Bureau. Spatiotemporal analysis indicates that <b>homicide</b> <b>rates</b> decreased in areas where high-rise projects were demolished, but increased in other areas. A spatial lag model indicates that detrimental socioeconomic factors are correlated with <b>homicide</b> <b>rates</b> spatially. A regression model with fixed effects for community areas indicates that the presence of high-rise housing increases <b>homicide</b> <b>rates.</b> The results emphasize the need to consider possibly unintended consequences in public housing policy. Based on the literature and data, preventive measures are vital, as bad policies and designs present the risk of a downward spiral that is almost impossible to break once it has begun. There are possibilities of conducting further research in the area in more detail and with more material under examination...|$|R
