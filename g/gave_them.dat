5|$|Lacaille charted and {{designated}} ten {{stars with}} the Bayer designations Alpha through to Kappa in 1756. He catalogued stars that became Lambda and Mu {{but did not}} designate them as he considered them informes as they lay outside the asterism proper. Baily considered them part of Musca, and Gould <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> their Bayer designations. Francis Baily also dropped Kappa, which he felt was too faint to warrant a name, and designated two adjacent stars as Zeta1 and Zeta2. These last two stars are 1° apart, quite far to be sharing a Bayer designation. Lacaille had originally labelled the fainter one as Zeta, while Baily presupposed he'd meant to label the brighter one. Reluctant to remove Lacaille's designation, he <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> both the Zeta designation. Altogether there are 62 stars brighter than magnitude 6.5 in the constellation.|$|E
