5|$|Common ravens are {{omnivorous}} {{and highly}} opportunistic: their diet may vary widely with location, season and serendipity. For example, those foraging on tundra on the Arctic North Slope of Alaska obtained about <b>half</b> <b>their</b> energy needs from predation, mainly of microtine rodents, and half by scavenging, mainly of caribou and ptarmigan carcasses.|$|E
5|$|Banded sea kraits are semiaquatic. Juveniles stay {{in water}} and on {{adjacent}} coast, but adults are able to move further inland and spend <b>half</b> <b>their</b> time on land and half in the ocean. Adult males are more terrestrially active during mating and hunt in shallower water, requiring more terrestrial locomotive ability. On the other hand, adult females are less active on land during mating and hunt in deeper water, requiring more aquatic locomotive ability. Because males are smaller, they crawl and swim faster than females.|$|E

5000|$|For its part, the American {{historian}} Edmund O'Callaghan {{estimated that}} the Spanish army had already lost <b>half</b> of <b>their</b> men even before withdrawing: [...] "Harrassed, dispirited, and reduced to almost one <b>half</b> of <b>their</b> original numbers, the Spanish troops retired within their own frontier".|$|R
5|$|During {{battles in}} Soviet Union in 1941 and 1942, the Waffen-SS {{suffered}} enormous casualties. The LSSAH and Das Reich lost over <b>half</b> <b>their</b> troops to illness and combat casualties. In need of recruits, Himmler began to accept soldiers {{that did not}} fit the original SS racial profile. In early 1942, SS-Leibstandarte, SS-Totenkopf, and SS-Das Reich were withdrawn to the West to refit and were converted to Panzergrenadier divisions. The SS-Panzer Corps returned to the Soviet Union in 1943 and participated in the Third Battle of Kharkov in February and March.|$|E
5|$|Having {{performed}} well in training exercises during 1941 and early 1942, {{elements of the}} 2nd Division were selected as the main force for Operation Jubilee, a large-scale amphibious raid on the port of Dieppe in German-occupied France. On 19August 1942, with air and naval gunfire support, the division's 4th and 6th Infantry Brigades assaulted Dieppe's beaches. The Germans were well prepared and, despite being reinforced, the Canadians sustained heavy losses {{and had to be}} evacuated, with fewer than <b>half</b> <b>their</b> number returning to the United Kingdom.|$|E

Apollo bought a portfolio of Irish home loans from Lloyds Bank in December 2013 for €307m, less than <b>half</b> <b>their</b> nominal £610m (€367m) value. The shares were bought by an Apollo Global Management subsidiary, Tanager Limited. The portfolio made a £33m loss last year.|$|E

5|$|Over {{two-thirds of}} Kansas' offense {{came through the}} air as the Jayhawks racked up 249net passing yards. The Hokies, meanwhile, earned almost <b>half</b> <b>their</b> offense on the ground. The end result of the varying {{offensive}} strategies was much the same, however. Kansas successfully converted six of its 17third-down attempts, while Virginia Tech converted seven of its 17attempts. The time of possession was one key stat in favor of Kansas, as Kansas controlled the ball for 33:47, over 7 minutes more than Virginia Tech's possession time of 26:13.|$|E
5|$|Tennessee's first Final Four {{game was}} against SEC foe, Arkansas, the 9th-seed {{out of the}} West Region. The Razorbacks had upset three {{different}} teams to reach the Final Four, Hawaii, Kansas, and 2nd-seeded Duke. Despite a poor first half shooting performance, the Vols led 39–28 halfway through the game. The second half saw the Lady Vols make over <b>half</b> <b>their</b> shots, propelling the team to the national championship with an 86–58, the largest margin of victory in the Women's National Semifinals history.|$|E
5|$|After the debacles of the Schwarz era {{and brief}} {{control of the}} team by the CFL (see above) the Argos were rescued by David Cynamon and Howard Sokolowski in 2004. There was {{optimism}} surrounding the duo's arrival and attendance figures improved in their six years heading the organization. It was also appreciated that the two were Torontonians after a quarter-century of foreign and/or corporate ownership. But by 2010 losses were great enough that the team was again put on the block and eventually sold to David Braley. There was some controversy surrounding Braley's takeover. He is simultaneously owner of the BC Lions, raising questions of competitive integrity. It was also revealed that Braley had bankrolled half of Cynamon and Sokolowski's initial $2 million buy-in of the Argos in 2004, and covered <b>half</b> <b>their</b> subsequent losses, in exchange for half of the 2007 Grey Cup profits.|$|E

5|$|By 1300 only Harlech and Conwy {{had been}} {{properly}} completed: Caernarfon's town walls were finished, {{but much of}} the castle was still incomplete and at Beaumaris Castle the inner walls was only <b>half</b> <b>their</b> intended height, with gaps in the outer walls. By 1304 the total building programme in Wales had come to at least £80,000, almost six times Edward's annual income. Edward had meanwhile become embroiled in a long-running sequence of wars in Scotland which began to consume his attention and financial resources, and as a result further work on the Welsh castles slowed to a crawl. In 1306 Edward became concerned about a possible Scottish invasion of North Wales, spurring fresh construction work, but money remained much more limited than before. By 1330 all new work had finally ceased, and Caernarfon and Beaumaris were never fully completed.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} stages of World War II, the entire Cold War, {{and to a}} lesser extent afterwards, {{uranium-235}} has been used as the fissile explosive material to produce nuclear weapons. Initially, two major types of fission bombs were built: a relatively simple device that uses uranium-235 and a more complicated mechanism that uses plutonium-239 derived from uranium-238. Later, a much more complicated and far more powerful type of fission/fusion bomb (thermonuclear weapon) was built, that uses a plutonium-based device to cause a mixture of tritium and deuterium to undergo nuclear fusion. Such bombs are jacketed in a non-fissile (unenriched) uranium case, and they derive more than <b>half</b> <b>their</b> power from the fission of this material by fast neutrons from the nuclear fusion process.|$|E
5|$|In the {{economic}} austerity of post-war Britain, Larwood's business made little money. He was persuaded, largely by his erstwhile opponent Jack Fingleton, {{that he would}} find better prospects and a warm welcome in Australia, {{and he decided to}} emigrate there with his family, which by then included five daughters. On 1 April 1950 the Larwoods sailed on SS Orontes—the ship that had carried Jardine's party 18 years previously. On arrival in Australia the welcome was warm and immediate. During their initial weeks in a Sydney hotel, unbeknown to them <b>half</b> <b>their</b> bills were paid by the former prime minister Ben Chifley. Despite a housing shortage, the family was soon settled in a bungalow in the Sydney suburb of Kingsford, and Larwood found steady employment with a soft drinks firm. Fingleton later arranged a meeting between Larwood and Chifley; their respective broad Nottinghamshire and Australian accents meant that neither could understand the other, and Fingleton had to act as an interpreter.|$|E

5|$|On the 116th RCT front, the {{remainder}} of the 1st Battalion, B/116, C/116 and D/116, were due to land in support of A/116 at Dog Green. Three boats, including their headquarters and beach-master groups, landed too far west, under the cliffs. Their exact casualties in getting across the beach are unknown, but the one-third to one-half that made it to shore {{spent the rest of the}} day pinned down by snipers. Not all sections of the badly scattered B/116 landed there, but those that did were quickly forced to join those survivors of A/116 fighting for survival at the water's edge. Two companies of 2nd Rangers, coming in later on the edge of Dog Green, did manage to reach the seawall, but at the cost of <b>half</b> <b>their</b> strength.|$|E
5|$|Though the Giants {{kept the}} game {{close in the}} first half, and went into halftime down 10–0, the Ravens {{dominated}} the second <b>half.</b> <b>Their</b> defense (led by game MVP Ray Lewis) frustrated Kerry Collins all game long, resulting in Collins turning {{in one of the}} worst playoff performances in Super Bowl history. Collins completed 15 of 39 passes for 112yards and 4 interceptions. The Ravens won the game 34–7 {{in one of the most}} lopsided Super Bowls ever. The lone Giants score came on a Ron Dixon kickoff return for a touchdown. On the very next kickoff, the Ravens countered as Jermaine Lewis also returned a kickoff for a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|When the October journées took place, France's revolutionary decade, 1789–1799, {{had barely}} begun. The revolution's {{capacity}} for violence was as yet not fully realized. The storming of the Bastille had occurred {{less than three}} months earlier. Flush with newly discovered power, the common citizens of France – particularly in the teeming capital, Paris – felt a newly discovered desire to participate in politics and government. The poorest among them were almost exclusively concerned with the issue of food: most workers spent nearly <b>half</b> <b>their</b> income on bread. In the post-Bastille period, price inflation and severe shortages in Paris became commonplace, as did local incidents of violence in the marketplaces.|$|E

5|$|While Hamilton was in Congress, discontented {{soldiers}} {{began to}} pose {{a danger to the}} young United States. Most of the army was then posted at Newburgh, New York. Those in the army were paying for much of their own supplies, and they had not been paid in eight months. Furthermore, the Continental officers had been promised, in May 1778, after Valley Forge, a pension of <b>half</b> <b>their</b> pay when they were discharged. By the early 1780s, due to the structure of the government under the Articles of Confederation, it had no power to tax to either raise revenue or pay its soldiers. In 1782 after several months without pay, a group of officers organized to send a delegation to lobby Congress, led by Capt. Alexander McDougall. The officers had three demands: the Army's pay, their own pensions, and commutation of those pensions into a lump-sum payment if Congress were unable to afford the half-salary pensions for life. Congress rejected the proposal.|$|E
5|$|After {{kicking off}} {{to start the}} game, Arizona got the ball first in the second <b>half.</b> <b>Their</b> first drive went three-and-out. After a 51-yard punt, Nevada took over at their own 11-yard line. They put {{together}} an 11-play, 89-yard drive that culminated with a 33-yard touchdown pass from Cody Fajardo to Richy Turner. During the course of throwing the touchdown pass, Fajardo hurt his hand and was seen shaking it {{on his way to}} the end zone to celebrate the score. He returned for Nevada's next offensive drive. Arizona's next drive got them into Nevada territory, but an interception thrown by Matt Scott ended any hopes of scoring. Nevada took the field and drove 84 yards down the field on 15 plays. Near the end of the drive once Nevada was inside the 10-yard line, Fajardo ran the ball for a gain of three yards. During the course of the play, he took a hit to the head from an Arizona defender. He exited the game for one play, but subsequently returned on that drive and scored a one-yard rushing touchdown. Arizona was held scoreless in the quarter, and heading into the final quarter of regulation, Nevada possessed a 45-28 lead.|$|E
5|$|After {{ten more}} days, the ships spotted an inlet close Champotón, and a landing party {{discovered}} fresh water. Armed Maya warriors approached from the city, and communication was attempted with signs. Night fell {{by the time}} the water casks had been filled and the attempts at communication concluded. By sunrise the Spanish had been surrounded by a sizeable army. The massed Maya warriors launched an assault and all of the Spanish party received wounds in the frantic melee that followed, including Hernández de Córdoba. The Spanish regrouped and forced passage to the shore, where their discipline collapsed and a frantic scramble for the boats ensued, leaving the Spanish vulnerable to the pursuing Maya warriors who waded into the sea behind them. By the end of the battle, the Spanish had lost over fifty men, more than <b>half</b> <b>their</b> number, and five more men died from their wounds in the following days. The battle had lasted only an hour. They were now far from help and low on supplies; too many men had been lost and injured to sail all three ships back to Cuba, so one was abandoned. The ship's pilot then steered a course for Cuba via Florida, and Hernández de Cordóba wrote a report to Governor Diego Velázquez describing the voyage and, most importantly, the discovery of gold. Hernández died soon after from his wounds.|$|E
