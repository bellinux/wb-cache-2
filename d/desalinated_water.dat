5|$|In Oman, {{production}} of <b>desalinated</b> <b>water</b> was interrupted, as both of Oman's desalination plants failed. The first, Ghubrah, lost supplies of natural gas, halting production; while the second, Barka, sustained a damaged switchgear due to flooding. These plants provided water to Muscat's 631,000residents and surrounding areas, triggering severe water shortages across eastern Oman. To rectify the situation, officials used water tanks. The water returned to near normal in five days, {{as the two}} plants returned to service. Additionally, electricians worked quickly to repair the power outages across the region. Five days after Gonu hit, utilities were restored to most of Muscat and the coastal provinces. The Omani army assisted residents in returning to their houses. Even though the Omani government did not request any international aid, the United States offered assistance through naval ships in the area; this was eventually rejected. The country lost an estimated $200million (2007USD) in oil exports. In the months after the storm, the government allocated funds {{for the removal of}} debris and trees, as well as restoration of roads in tourist areas. Additionally, the National Committee for Civil Defence set up 139buildings to provide temporary housing for 8,192people. Services such as water and electricity were gradually restored, and people returned to their homes. By two weeks after the storm's passage, most of those remaining in shelters were from Qurayat, one of the most severely affected villages.|$|E
25|$|Only {{the last}} two sources are renewable. Their volume, however, is minimal. Desalination plants provide about half the country’s {{drinking}} water. About 40% comes from groundwater. The remainder comes from surface water (about 10%). <b>Desalinated</b> <b>water</b> is prevalent along the coasts, surface water in the southwest region and groundwater elsewhere. The capital Riyadh, however, is supplied {{to a great extent}} with <b>desalinated</b> <b>water</b> pumped from the Persian Gulf over 467km to the city located {{in the heart of the}} country.|$|E
25|$|Land-based and {{near-shore}} facilities offer {{three main}} advantages over those located in deep water. Plants constructed {{on or near}} land do not require sophisticated mooring, lengthy power cables, or the more extensive maintenance associated with open-ocean environments. They can be installed in sheltered areas {{so that they are}} relatively safe from storms and heavy seas. Electricity, <b>desalinated</b> <b>water,</b> and cold, nutrient-rich seawater could be transmitted from near-shore facilities via trestle bridges or causeways. In addition, land-based or near-shore sites allow plants to operate with related industries such as mariculture or those that require <b>desalinated</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E

25|$|On March 22, 2015, Saga University {{opened a}} Flash-type {{desalination}} demonstration facility on Kumejima. This satellite of their Institute of Ocean Energy uses post-OTEC deep seawater from the Okinawa OTEC Demonstration Facility and raw surface seawater to produce <b>desalinated</b> <b>water.</b> Air is {{extracted from the}} closed system with a vacuum pump. When raw sea water is pumped into the flash chamber it boils, allowing pure steam to rise and the salt and remaining seawater to be removed. The steam is returned to liquid in a heat exchanger with cold post-OTEC deep seawater. The <b>desalinated</b> <b>water</b> {{can be used in}} hydrogen production or drinking water (if minerals are added).|$|E
25|$|A {{possible}} link {{of heavy}} <b>desalinated</b> <b>water</b> use and national iodine deficiency was suggested by Israeli researchers. They found a high burden of iodine deficiency {{in the general}} population of Israel: 62% of school-age children and 85% of pregnant women fall below the WHO’s adequacy range. They also pointed out the national reliance on iodine-depleted <b>desalinated</b> <b>water,</b> the absence of a universal salt iodization program and reports of increased use of thyroid medication in Israel as a possible reasons that the population’s iodine intake is low. In the year that the survey was conducted, the amount of water produced from the desalination plants constitutes about 50% of the quantity of fresh water supplied for all needs and about 80% of the water supplied for domestic and industrial needs in Israel.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{its energy}} consumption, desalinating sea water is {{generally}} more costly than fresh water from rivers or groundwater, water recycling and water conservation. However, these alternatives {{are not always}} available and depletion of reserves is a critical problem worldwide.

25|$|The Saudi water sector, {{like the}} entire country, has {{undergone}} tremendous changes {{over the past}} decades from a system based {{on the use of}} local renewable water resources for small-scale irrigation and limited domestic uses to a system largely based on the use of <b>desalinated</b> <b>water</b> and fossil groundwater for large-scale irrigation and domestic, commercial and industrial uses at a level comparable to developed countries. The Saline Water Conversion Corporation, created in 1965, has been an important player in this process of change.|$|E
25|$|Desalination of {{seawater}} {{is expected}} to become {{more important in the}} future through a long-planned regional desalination plant that would provide <b>desalinated</b> <b>water</b> using the piped water network throughout the entire Gaza strip. For over 20 years, a major desalination plant for Gaza has been discussed. The Palestinian Water Authority has approved a $500 million facility. Israel supports it and has quietly begun to offer Palestinians desalination training. In 2012 the French government committed a 10 million-euro grant for the plant. Arab countries, coordinated by the Islamic Development Bank, committed to provide half of the necessary funds, matching an expected European financial commitment. The European Investment Bank provides technical assistance.|$|E
25|$|The new price {{proposed}} by Malaysia {{was close to}} the price of <b>desalinated</b> <b>water.</b> The government of Singapore said that Malaysia had no right to alter the price of water. It further clarified that the price paid by Hong Kong included payment for substantial infrastructure provided by China, while Malaysia provided only access to raw water and the infrastructure necessary to convey the water inside Malaysia was entirely paid for by Singapore. Singapore finally refused to accept a higher price and decided to give up on its goal to extend the agreements beyond 2061. Instead, the country decided to achieve self-sufficiency in its water supply before 2061 and the negotiations ended in 2003 without result.|$|E
5000|$|A similar effect {{known as}} Vapor-compression {{desalination}} was later used for desalination of water.

25|$|In 1997, {{the first}} reverse osmosis {{desalination}} plant in Israel opened in Eilat. In 2002, under the impact of drought, the Government approved the construction of large seawater desalination plants along the Mediterranean coast. These installations would supply 305 million m3/yr of <b>desalinated</b> <b>water</b> by the year 2010 and 500 million m³/yr by 2015. By mid-2008 two of the new plants with a capacity of 130 million m3/yr were in operation. In parallel to the desalination program the cabinet also decided to promote water savings activities that could reduce household water use by at least 10 percent. In 2012, the Ashkelon Desalination Plant was converting 15,000 to 16,000 cubic meters of seawater to fresh water every hour, supplying 15 percent of Israel's annual water supply.|$|E
25|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} in Saudi Arabia {{is characterized by}} challenges and achievements. One of the main challenges is water scarcity. In order to overcome water scarcity, substantial investments have been undertaken in seawater desalination, water distribution, sewerage and wastewater treatment. Today about 50% of drinking water comes from desalination, 40% from the mining of non-renewable groundwater and only 10% from surface water in the mountainous southwest of the country. The capital Riyadh, located {{in the heart of}} the country, is supplied with <b>desalinated</b> <b>water</b> pumped from the Persian Gulf over a distance of 467km. Water is provided almost for free to residential users. Despite improvements, service quality remains poor, for example in terms of continuity of supply. Another challenge is weak institutional capacity and governance, reflecting general characteristics of the public sector in Saudi Arabia. Among the achievements is a significant increase in desalination, and in access to water, the expansion of wastewater treatment, as well as the use of treated effluent for the irrigation of urban green spaces, and for agriculture.|$|E
25|$|Since 2000, the {{government}} has increasingly relied on {{the private sector to}} operate water and sanitation infrastructure, beginning with desalination and wastewater treatment plants. Since the creation of the National Water Company (NWC) in 2008, the operation of urban water distribution systems in the four largest cities has gradually been delegated to private companies as well. The apparent paradox of very low water tariffs and water privatization is explained by government subsidies. The government buys <b>desalinated</b> <b>water</b> from private operators at high prices and resells the bulk water for free. Likewise, {{the government}} directly pays private operators that run the water distribution and sewer systems of large cities under management contracts. Furthermore, it fully subsidizes investments in water distribution and sewers. Water utilities are expected to recover an increasing share of their costs from the sale of treated effluent to industries. In January 2016 water and sewer tariffs were increased {{for the first time in}} more than a decade, which resulted in discontent and in the sacking of the Minister of Water and Energy Abdullah Al-Hussayen in April 2016.|$|E

25|$|Saudi Arabia is {{the largest}} {{producer}} of <b>desalinated</b> <b>water</b> in the world. In 2011 the volume of water supplied by the country’s 27 desalination plants at 17 locations was 3.3 million m3/day (1.2 billion m3/year). 6 plants are located on the East Coast and 21 plants on the Red Sea Coast. 12 plants use multi-stage flash distillation (MSF) and 7 plants use multi-effect distillation (MED). Both MSF and MED plants are integrated with power plants (dual-purpose plants), using steam from the power plants {{as a source of}} energy. 8 plants are single-purpose plants that use reverse osmosis (RO) technology and power from the grid. By far the largest plant in 2012, Jubail II on the East Coast, is a MSF plant built in subsequent stages since 1983 with a capacity of almost 950,000 m3/day that supplies Riyadh. The largest RO plant in 2012 was located in Yanbu on the Red Sea. It supplies the city of Medina and has a capacity of 128,000 m3/day. The MED plants are much smaller. Mecca receives its water from plants in Jeddah and Shoaiba, just south of Jeddah. Ras al Khair, the largest plant of the country with a capacity of 1 million m3/day was opened in 2014, using RO technology.|$|E
25|$|In May 2009, King Abdullah {{gave the}} go-ahead {{for a new}} National Water Strategy until 2022, {{replacing}} an earlier Water Strategy from 1998. The strategy included investments of Jordanian Dinar 5.86 billion (US$8.24 billion) {{over a period of}} 15 years, corresponding to more than 160% of Jordan's GDP. It also foresaw a decreasing reliance on groundwater from 32% in 2007 to 17%, increased use of treated wastewater in agriculture from 10% to 13% and increased use of desalination from 1% to 31%. According to then-Minister of Water, Raed Abu Soud, even after the completion of the Disi Water Conveyance Project, the water deficit in 2022 would be about 500 million cubic metres, highlighting the need to include desalination under the Red Sea-Dead Sea canal in the strategy. The strategy also envisaged institutional reforms such as enacting a new water law, separating operational from administrative functions, as well as production from distribution operations, creating a Water Council with advisory functions and establishing a Water Regulatory Commission. While the legal and institutional reforms were not implemented, the Disi Water Conveyance Project was completed in 2013 by the Turkish firm Gama. The influx of about one million refugees from Syria since 2012 increased the population of Jordan to more than nine million. It also increased water demand substantially. For lack of finaning, the Red Sea-Dead Sea Canal is not being pursued any more in its original form for the time being. Instead, a scaled-down, more realistic version is being pursued. This project involves a water swap between Jordan and Israel, with Jordan supplying <b>desalinated</b> <b>water</b> from Aqaba to Southern Israel, while Israel provides additional water from the Sea of Galilee to Northern Jordan. Brine water from the desalination plant is to be supplied to the Dead Sea. As of 2015, the bidding for the desalination plant at Aqaba was under preparation.|$|E
500|$|Fresh water aboard Queen Mary 2 is {{supplied}} by three seawater desalination plants. The plants, {{each with a}} capacity of [...] per day, use multiple effect plate (MEP) distillation technology. The plants' energy {{is supplied}} primarily by steam and cooling water from the ship's gas turbines and diesel engines, or if needed by steam from the ship's two oil-fired boilers. The traditional multiple-effect distillation technology has been improved for the ship's plant, so that scaling of plates is reduced, vastly reducing maintenance required. The <b>desalinated</b> <b>water</b> has a very low salt content of less than five parts per million. Average total water production is [...] per day with a capacity of [...] {{so that there is}} ample spare capacity. The ship could easily be supplied by only two of the three plants. Potable water tanks have a capacity of , enough for more than three days of supply. If the engines are running on low load (when the ship is running at a slow speed) the engine jacket cooling water temperature is insufficient to heat the seawater to run the desalination plants. In that case steam from oil-fired boilers is used to heat the sea water. This is uneconomical as generating steam is expensive. It may be cheaper, therefore, to buy water in a particular port than to produce it on board. The seawater intakes are located in the hull of the ship. Concentrated salt solution (brine) is discharged to the sea closer to the ship's stern together with cooling water from the engines. An additional plant was added during the 2016 refit works.|$|E

40|$|Microbial {{desalination}} cells (MDCs) are a new, energy-sustainable {{method for}} using organic matter in wastewater as the energy source for desalination. The electric potential gradient created by exoelectrogenic bacteria <b>desalinates</b> <b>water</b> by driving ion transport {{through a series}} of ion-exchange membranes (IEMs). The specific MDC architecture and current conditions substantially affect the amount of wastewater needed to <b>desalinate</b> <b>water.</b> Other baseline conditions have varied among studies making comparisons of the effectiveness of different designs problematic. The extent of desalination is affected by water transport through IEMs by both osmosis and electroosmosis. Various methods have been used, such as electrolyte recirculation, to avoid low pH that can inhibit exoelectrogenic activity. The highest current density in an MDC to date is 8. 4 A/m 2, which is lower than that produced in other bioelectrochemical systems. This implies that there is a room for substantial improvement in desalination rates and overall performance. We review here {{the state of the art}} in MDC design and performance, safety issues related to the use of MDCs with wastewater, and areas that need to be examined to achieve practical application of this new technology. © 2012 Elsevier B.
