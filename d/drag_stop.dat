In this paper, we develop an implicit timestepping method that preserves the exact conservation of the both linear and angular momentum in the underlying SPH algorithm, but unlike previous schemes, allows the iterations to converge to arbitrary accuracy and is suited {{to the treatment of}} non- linear drag regimes. The algorithm presented in Paper I is also extended to deal with realistic astrophysical drag regimes, including both linear and non-linear Epstein and Stokes drag. The scheme is benchmarked against the test suite presented in Paper I, including i) the analytic solutions of the dustybox problem and ii) solutions of the dustywave, dustyshock, dustysedov and dustydisc obtained with explicit timestepping. We find that the implicit method is 1 - 10 times faster than the explicit temporal integration when the ratio r between the the timestep and the <b>drag</b> <b>stopping</b> time is 1 < r < 1000.

More generally, there is a linear relationship between the base flow density and the maximum entrainable grain size in the wind. A pileup of micron sized dust grains can occur in the upper atmosphere at critical radii in the disc as grains decouple from the low-density wind. Entrainment is a strong function of location in the disc, resulting in a size sorting of grains in the outflow [...] -the largest grain being carried out between 10 [...] 20 AU.

40|$|Calcium-aluminum-rich {{inclusions}} (CAIs) are {{the oldest}} solar system solids known in primitive meteorites (chondrites). They predate the other components by 1 - 2 Myr, and likely condensed {{within a short}} time interval, close to the Sun in the gaseous protoplanetary disk. Their preservation must counterbalance both the sunward drift caused by gas drag and the general inward motion of the entraining gas. We propose that an efficient outward transport of CAIs can be achieved by advection {{as a result of the}} viscous expansion of the disk, provided it is initially less than 10 AU in size, which we argue is plausible from both observational and theoretical points of view. Gas <b>drag</b> would <b>stop</b> this outward motion within $ 10 ^ 5 $ yr. However, by that time, a magnetically dead zone would have developed as gravitational instabilities fade away, which would trap CAIs for a significant fraction of the disk lifetime because of the reduced advection velocities. The dead zone would also prevent outward diffusion of subsequently condensed CAIs, contributing to their observed narrow age range. This preservation mechanism is independent of the outward transport scenario (before the dead zone formation) and a natural consequence of considering the source of turbulence in accretion disks.

30|$|The {{optimization}} {{approach can}} be elaborated to consider additional characteristics of keyboard function. For example, a popular approach is to enable predictive typing, where the keyboard monitors what is typed and presents a list of options and the user can select a full word after entering the first few letters. Such a feature carries {{both positive and negative}} aspects for users of switch keyboards. On the positive side, it may require entering fewer characters to type common words and thereby it may speed communication. On the negative side, navigating to the list of choices requires the user to guide the cursor to the list (either with a linear cursor path or in a hierarchical structure). There is, of course, a risk of a selection error when trying to reach an item in the prediction list, and an error in that context may alter the list and thereby render the system rather difficult to work with. If a prediction system is part of a keyboard, then {{there is a need to}} optimize its design within the keyboard, and the approach we have presented here can be modified to provide such optimization. Similarly, it is important to consider how users would correct errors with a switch keyboard. Error correction with a switch keyboard using a delete or undo command can only be initiated by the user guiding the cursor to an appropriate action key. To correct past text, switch keyboards have action keys that move a marker in the text (e.g., up a line or down a page). Some switch keyboards also allow for control of mouse actions (movement, hold, <b>drag,</b> select, <b>stop,</b> click, and double-click commands), which can be used to fix errors, among other things. Such command keys should also be optimized according to their frequency of use for a given user.|$|R

50|$|For {{flight to}} occur in Aves, four {{physical}} forces (thrust and drag, lift and weight) must be favorably combined. In order for birds to balance these forces, certain physical characteristics are required. Asymmetrical wings, found on all flying birds {{with the exception of}} hummingbirds, help in the production of thrust and lift. Anything that moves through the air produces drag due to friction. The aerodynamic body of a bird can reduce <b>drag,</b> but when <b>stopping</b> or slowing down a bird will use its tail and feet to increase drag. Weight is the largest obstacle birds must overcome in order to fly. An animal can more easily attain flight by reducing its absolute weight. Birds evolved from other theropod dinosaurs that had already gone through a phase of size reduction during the Middle Jurassic, combined with rapid evolutionary changes. Flying birds during their evolution further reduced relative weight through several characteristics such as the loss of teeth, gonadal hypertrophy, and fusion of bones. Teeth were replaced by a lightweight bill made of keratin, and chewing moved to the bird's gizzard. Other advanced physical characteristics evolved for flight are a keel for the attachment of flight muscles and an enlarged cerebellum for fine motor coordination. These were gradual changes, though, and not strict conditions for flight: the first birds had teeth, at best a small keel and relatively unfused bones. Pneumatic bone, that is hollow or filled with air sacs, has often been seen as an adaptation reducing weight, but it was already present in non-flying dinosaurs, and birds on average do not have a lighter skeleton than mammals of the same size. The same is true for the furcula, a bone which enhances skeletal bracing for the stresses of flight.|$|R
40|$|Tread (block) braking {{is still}} one of the most common braking systems on railway vehicles. The action is carried out by {{pressing}} brake blocks against the tread of a wheel, which is also in rolling contact with the rail. The extensive use of tread brakes in metro and suburban applications has created a need for design guidelines or standards for wheels exposed to repeated stop braking. The thermal capacity of the wheels puts a limit to railway tread braking systems. With the exception of the drag braking cases described in the European standard EN 13979 - 1, there are no known standards or guidelines regarding the thermal capacity limits for wheels. In the present work, an extensive literature survey has been made with special focus on the braking capacity of wheels. Several aspects of the tread braking system, important for the dimensioning of railway wheels, have been assessed, such as brake block materials and residual stresses and temperature gradients through wheel rim and wheel disc. Additionally, two different railway wheel designs, with typical characteristics of freight and metro wheels, have been numerically studied with respect to design criteria for load cases of <b>drag</b> braking and <b>stop</b> braking. Brake rig experiments and a field test campaign were performed and aimed at measuring wheel and brake block temperatures during different service conditions for a metro line. It was concluded that even though the same nominal routes were simulated in the brake rig tests as those the field tests, the braking efforts are different. Therefore, simulation and calibration tools were employed in order to facilitate a comparison between measured temperatures. The results showed the importance of knowing the convection cooling parameters for different wagons if prolonged braking action is to be considered. Heat partitioning between wheel, block and rail has been numerically studied in a broad parametric study to investigate the influence of brake block materials, thermal parameters and brake pressure distribution. By use of a plane model, the implication of temperature variations around the wheel circumference (hot spots) is studied in detail. Even though the hot spots have a major impact on local temperatures, they were found to have only a minor influence on the global heat partitioning in the wheel-block-rail system. By use of an axisymmetric model, it was found that a presumed constant axial position of the wheel-rail contact towards the flange side of the tread leads to substantially higher maximum tread temperatures than a wheel-rail contact centred at the brake block position...|$|R
40|$|Tread (block) braking {{is still}} one of the most common braking systems on railway vehicles. The action is carried out by {{pressing}} brake blocks against the tread of a wheel, which is also in rolling contact with the rail. The extensive use of tread brakes in metro and suburban applications has created a need for design guidelines or standards for wheels exposed to repeated stop braking. The thermal capacity of the wheels puts a limit to railway tread braking systems. With the exception of the drag braking cases described in the European standard EN 13979 - 1, there are no known standards or guidelines regarding the thermal capacity limits for wheels. In the present work, important aspects of the thermal capacity of tread braked railway wheels have been assessed in a literature survey. Then two different railway wheel designs, with typical characteristics of freight and metro wheels, have been numerically studied with respect to standard design criteria for load cases of <b>drag</b> braking and <b>stop</b> braking. The influence of brake block materials, thermal parameters and brake pressure distribution on the wheel temperatures has been investigated. A general result is that hot spots only have a minor influence on the global heat partitioning in the wheel-block-rail system even though the hot spots have a major impact on local temperatures. Brake rig experiments and a field test campaign were performed and aimed at measuring wheel and brake block temperatures during different service conditions for a metro line. Simulation and calibration tools were employed in order to facilitate a comparison between measured temperatures. The results showed the importance of knowing the convection cooling parameters for different wagons if prolonged braking action is to be considered. In a pin-on-disc experimental study of railway braking materials, the heat partitioning characteristics between wheel and block material at controlled elevated disc temperatures were investigated by a finite element approach where a model was calibrated using measured temperatures. In the final part of the present thesis, a modelling framework was proposed and developed that represents typical conditions in metro and suburban operations, in particular during sequential stop braking. A parametric study was done for analysing the influence of various loading levels and other important factors on temperatures, axial flange deflection, residual stresses and the fatigue life of the wheels. The model and the numerical results will be useful for assessing the thermal capacity of wheels and for developing new design rules and standards. It was found that the mechanical and thermal loadings have different influences on the web damage and on the estimated fatigue life depending on load cases and wheel design...|$|R
