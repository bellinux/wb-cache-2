25|$|Many Jews, persecuted by the Nazis, {{received}} {{help from}} the Poles; help, ranging from major acts of heroism, to minor acts of kindness involving {{hundreds of thousands of}} helpers acting often anonymously. This rescue effort occurred even though ethnic Poles themselves were the subject to capital punishment {{at the hands of the}} German police (since October 1941) if found offering any <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>help</b> to a person of Jewish faith or origin. Poland was the only occupied country in Europe in which such a death penalty was imposed and frequently used.|$|E

Mac Powell's vocal range spans from the low note of B3 to the high note of F5. The lyrics to the song {{have been described as}} being from the perspective of God, although the members of Third Day have described them differently; David Carr, the drummer for Third Day, described the lyrics as [...] "crying out to God and calling out his name", while Mac Powell described them as [...] "kind of a prayer. It's about when people are going through hard times and going through struggles that we've gotta call out to someone, and for us as people of faith it's calling out to God and hearing his voice... and for someone else it could be a friend or a family member that you've gotta reach out to <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>help</b> share those burdens you go through".

[...] In May 2009, W.K. discussed the accusations {{in an interview with}} British magazine Front, in which he stated that [...] "the nature of how we presented my initial offerings caused some confusion, even though I tried to make it as straightforward as possible," [...] and: [...] "Different people I've worked with and different parts of my back story have gotten twisted and changed.

2500|$|Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, {{vice-chairman}} of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, investigated {{how much}} the Soviet spy ring helped the USSR to build their bomb.

[...] "Thanks to information provided by their agents", Moynihan wrote in his book Secrecy, [...] "they did it in four." [...] In his posthumously published memoirs, Nikita Khrushchev, leader of the Soviet Union from 1953 to 1964, said that he [...] "cannot specifically say what <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>help</b> the Rosenbergs provided us" [...] but that he learned from Joseph Stalin and Vyacheslav Molotov that they [...] "had provided very significant help in accelerating the production of our atomic bomb." [...] However Boris V. Brokhovich, the engineer who later became director of Chelyabinsk-40, the plutonium production reactor and extraction facility that the Soviet Union used to create its first bomb material, called Khrushchev a 'silly fool' and claimed the development of the bomb had been a matter of trial and error. [...] "You sat the Rosenbergs in the electric chair for nothing," [...] he said. [...] "We got nothing from the Rosenbergs." [...] The notes allegedly typed by Ethel apparently contained little that was directly used in the Soviet atomic bomb project. According to Alexander Feklisov, the former Soviet agent who was Julius' contact, the Rosenbergs did not provide the Soviet Union with any useful material about the atomic bomb: [...] "He [...] didn't understand anything about the atomic bomb and he couldn't help us." ...|$|E

60|$|Possibly, the {{foregoing}} sentiments {{have taken a}} spice of acridity from a circumstance that happened about {{this stage of the}} feast, and very much interrupted my own further enjoyment of it. Up to this time, my condition had been exceedingly felicitous, both on account of the brilliancy of the scene, and because I was in close proximity with three very pleasant English friends. One of them was a lady, whose honored name my readers would recognize as a household word, if I dared write it; another, a gentleman, likewise well known to them, whose fine taste, kind heart, and genial cultivation are qualities seldom mixed in such happy proportion as in him. The third was the man to whom I owed most in England, the warm benignity of whose nature was never weary of doing me good, who led me to many scenes of life, in town, camp, and country, which I never could have found out for myself, who knew precisely the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>help</b> a stranger needs, and gave it as freely as if he had not had a thousand more important things to live for.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} cancer patients' {{experience of}} the role of family physicians (FPs) in their care. DESIGN: Mail survey of a random sample of patients from the Manitoba Cancer Registry. SETTING: Manitoba. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred two adults, 6 to 12 months after diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion needing different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>help</b> from FPs and their rating of FPs' response; FACT-G quality-of-life score. RESULTS: Response rate was 56. 6 %; two thirds of the sample were in the follow-up phase. Most (91 %) had an FP involved in their care, but FP involvement decreased after diagnosis. The most frequently needed <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>help</b> (with general medical problems, quick referrals, taking extra time, and quick office appointments) were well provided by FPs, but family support was not. Higher quality-of-life scores were associated with more help with general medical problems, more provision of cancer-related information, and more emotional support of patients and their families. CONCLUSION: Family physicians respond well to the most common needs of cancer patients and should be proactive in offering their support to both patients and families...|$|R

Perhaps it is doing as much as it ought to do, even in this direction. Certainly there is another <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>help</b> of the most important character, for which we may look elsewhere than to the Government. The great mass of mankind have neither the liking, nor the aptitude, for either literary, or scientific, or artistic pursuits; nor, indeed, for excellence of any sort. Their ambition is to go through life with moderate exertion and a fair share of ease, doing common things in a common way. And a great blessing and comfort it is that the majority of men are of this mind; for the majority of things to be done are common things, and are quite well enough done when commonly done. The great end of life is not knowledge but action. What men need is, as much knowledge as they can assimilate and organise into a basis for action; give them more and it may become injurious. One knows people who are as heavy and stupid from undigested learning as others are from over-fulness of meat and drink. But {{a small percentage of the}} population is born with that most excellent quality, a desire for excellence, or with special aptitudes of some sort or another; Mr. Galton tells us that not more than one in four thousand may be expected to attain distinction, and not more than one in a million some share of that intensity of instinctive aptitude, that burning thirst for excellence, which is called genius.|$|E
