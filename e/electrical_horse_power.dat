5000|$|The {{commercial}} Hugon engine {{appeared in}} 1865, and in appearance much resembled the Lenoir engine, but with flame ignition and water spray injection into the cylinder {{to control the}} temperatures. It was manufactured in England by Fred B. Vallance at the Alicel Works, Bridge Street, Greenwich. According to an advert in [...] "The Newspaper Press" [...] in 1871, it was available in Quarter <b>Horse</b> <b>Power</b> £40, Half <b>Horse</b> <b>Power</b> £65, One <b>Horse</b> <b>Power</b> £85, Two <b>Horse</b> <b>Power</b> £110, and Three <b>Horse</b> <b>Power</b> £130.

50|$|The {{need for}} more power comes from {{necessity}} and desire when driving in steep sand dunes. This has driven sandrail engine builders to add performance features to engines such as the stock (24 to 50 <b>horse</b> <b>power)</b> Volkswagen engine. These include: larger pistons, turbochargers, dual racing carburetors, fuel injection, and high performance cylinder heads. Some performance engines can run on premium unleaded gasoline. However, many high performance engines must use racing fuel or fuel additives. A high performance sandrail Volkswagen engine can produce well into the 170-200+ <b>horse</b> <b>power</b> range and as high as 700 <b>horse</b> <b>power</b> with methanol fuel.|$|R
