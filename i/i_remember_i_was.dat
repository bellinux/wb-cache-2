500|$|The Porto manager, José Mourinho, led {{his team}} to the Champions League title the {{following}} year before moving to Chelsea. Reflecting on the final, Mourinho was happy to admit he played part of a historic moment in football. He said, [...] "As a football game, Celtic-Porto in Seville was the most exciting football game I have ever been involved in. An unbelievable game. Every time I see Martin O'Neill <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the lucky one that day. An incredible match. I've never seen such emotional people. It was unbelievable." ...|$|E
500|$|Killen {{conceived}} {{of the idea}} for the Brittens after creating and developing Lone Star for the Fox network. NBC had encouraged Killen to conceive a concept for a future television series after Lone Star cancellation. Within a few weeks, Killen sent a rough draft of the script to his agent Marc Korman. [...] "It was 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, and <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so freaked out by the script that I went upstairs to our guest bedroom where my wife was sick with the flu and I got into bed with her," [...] recalled Korman. [...] "I called Jen and said: 'I'm telling you, this script is remarkable. I've never read a pilot like this, and for a guy who has never written a procedural show in his life, he's actually making two cases work". Initially, Salke and Korman looked to sell acquisition rights to Fox.|$|E

This {{resulted}} in him being stopped by strikes {{for the first time}} in his career. On his match with Conor McGregor he said “I always saw it as a plus but the Conor McGregor fight was the turning point. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> backstage getting ready to walk out and I saw him and he threw this smile and pointed at me. I don’t know why but it really got to me, man. It really messed with my head." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{production}} {{was not without}} its lucky accidents: The company had just finished shooting the final segment of the sequence where Phyllis and Walter make their getaway after dumping their victim's body on the tracks. The crew was breaking for lunch before striking the set. In the script, the pair get in their car and simply drive away. But as Wilder got into his own car to leave, it wouldn't start. Inspired, he ran back and ordered the crew back. Wilder reshot the scene, only this time as Phyllis starts the car, the motor stalls and won't turn over. She tries several more times, but the car won't start and the two {{look at each other}} in growing panic. Walter desperately reaches over, turns the key and guns the motor, finally starting the car. Only then do they speed away from the crime scene. The result {{was one of the most}} suspenseful scenes in the film, but was not in the original script. MacMurray was surprised when he first saw it onscreen: [...] "...When I... turned the key <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing it fast and Billy kept saying, 'Make it longer, make it longer,' and finally I yelled, 'For Chrissake Billy, it's not going to hold that long,' and he said, 'Make it longer,' and he was right." ...|$|E

60|$|The apparel of our women-servants {{should be}} next regulated, {{that we may}} know the {{mistress}} from the maid. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> once put very much to the blush, being at a friend's house, and by him required to salute the ladies, I kissed the chamber-jade into the bargain, for she was as well dressed as the best. But I was soon undeceived by a general titter, which gave me the utmost confusion; nor can I believe myself {{the only person who}} has made such a mistake.|$|E
60|$|Now I {{remember}} nothing more. I have {{a confused}} idea of great happiness; I {{lived in an}} intoxication, half fearing {{it was all a}} dream, enchanted when anything occurred to assure me it was true. But the details of our life I have forgotten; <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> happy. Is it not a curious irony that we should recall our miseries with such plainness, and that our happiness should pass over us so indistinctly, that when it has gone we can scarcely realise that it ever existed? It is as though Fortune were jealous of the little happiness she has given us, and to revenge herself blots it out of the memory, filling the mind with miseries past.|$|E
6000|$|L.

But, will not you, at least, tell us whether the ideas of Life, as the power of putting things together, or [...] "making" [...] them; and of Death, as the power of pushing things separate, or [...] "unmaking" [...] them, may not be very simply held in balance against each other? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "So, {{with true}} alii-authority of command, saying, 'You will {{immediately}} follow after me,' I dived in. Everything {{he had said}} was correct. I found {{the entrance to the}} subterranean passage, swam carefully through it, cutting my shoulder once on the lava- sharp roof, and emerged in the darkness and air. But before I could count thirty, he broke water beside me, rested his hand on my arm to make sure of me, and directed me to swim ahead of him for the matter of a hundred feet or so. Then we touched bottom and climbed out on the rocks. And still no light, and <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> glad that our altitude was too high for centipedes.|$|E
6000|$|... 203. At another time, <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> again much {{under the}} question, Whether {{the blood of}} Christ was {{sufficient}} to save my soul? In which doubt I continued from morning till {{about seven or eight}} at night; and at last, when I was, as it were, quite worn out with fear, lest it should not lay hold on me, these words did sound suddenly within my heart, He is able. But methought this word ABLE was spoke so loud unto me; it showed such a great word, 'it seemed to be writ in great letters,' and gave such a justle to my fear and doubt, I mean for the time it tarried with me, which was about a day, as I never had from that all my life, either before or after that (Heb 7:25).|$|E
60|$|But {{it was not}} a {{refreshing}} slumber. I tossed and tumbled amid a series of vile dreams, in which everything seemed to go wrong with me. At last, <b>I</b> <b>remember,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> charging an unshaken square of Hungarian Grenadiers, with a single squadron upon spent horses, just as I did at Elchingen. I stood in my stirrups to shout 'Vive l'Empereur!' and as I did so, there came the answering roar from my hussars, 'Vive l'Empereur!' I sprang from my rough bed, with the words still ringing in my ears, and then, as I rubbed my eyes, and wondered if I were mad, the same cry came again, five thousand voices in one long-drawn yell. I looked out from my screen of brambles, and saw in the clear light of morning the very last thing that I should either have expected or chosen.|$|E
60|$|I {{began to}} recall what I {{had heard of}} cannibals. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> within an ace of calling for help. But {{the mere fact that}} he was a man, however wild, had {{somewhat}} reassured me, and my fear of Silver began to revive in proportion. I stood still, therefore, and cast about for some method of escape; and as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so thinking, the recollection of my pistol flashed into my mind. As soon as <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not defenceless, courage glowed again in my heart and I set my face resolutely for this man of the island and walked briskly towards him.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>remembered.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> one of Lord Chelmsford's guides in that unlucky Zulu War, and had {{the good}} fortune to leave the camp in charge of some wagons on the day before the battle. While <b>I</b> <b>was</b> waiting for the cattle to <b>be</b> inspanned <b>I</b> fell into {{conversation}} with this man, who held some small command among the native auxiliaries, and he had expressed to me his doubts as to the safety of the camp. At the time I told him to hold his tongue, and leave such matters to wiser heads; but afterwards I thought of his words.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> busy giving {{orders that}} the linen should be aired, and {{overlooking}} the store of sheets, when Gaspard and Armantine {{from the window}} called out: 'Horses, horses, mamma! fine cavaliers!' ...|$|R
