5|$|Mitochondrial genomes {{have far}} fewer genes than the {{bacteria}} {{from which they}} {{are thought to be}} descended. Although some <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> altogether, many have been transferred to the nucleus, such as the respiratory complex II protein subunits. This is thought to be relatively common over evolutionary time. A few organisms, such as the Cryptosporidium, actually have mitochondria that lack any DNA, presumably because all their genes <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> or transferred. In Cryptosporidium, the mitochondria have an altered ATP generation system that renders the parasite resistant to many classical mitochondrial inhibitors such as cyanide, azide, and atovaquone.|$|E
5|$|Over 230 {{works of}} Chopin survive; some {{compositions}} from early childhood <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost.</b> All his known works involve the piano, {{and only a}} few range beyond solo piano music, as either piano concertos, songs or chamber music.|$|E
5|$|The {{son of a}} minor scholar-official, {{his youth}} was spent on the {{standard}} education of a future civil servant: study and memorisation of the Confucian classics of philosophy, history and poetry.

5|$|Alongside {{rush hour}} traffic, {{thousands}} of residents in Oklahoma City attempted to outrun the storm by {{taking to the}} roads {{in an attempt to}} drive out of the tornado's projected path. By attempting to escape the storm by vehicle, in direct contrast to the recommended plan of action, residents put themselves at great risk from the storm; had the tornado maintained itself and passed over the congested freeways, more than 500 lives could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost.</b>|$|E
5|$|Altogether, around fifty Christian {{artifacts}} {{were found}} in Hasekura's estate in 1640, such as crosses, rosaries, religious gowns and religious paintings. The artifacts were seized and stored by the Date fief. An inventory was made again in 1840 describing the items as belonging to Hasekura Tsunenaga. Nineteen books were also mentioned in the inventory, but they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> since. The artifacts are today preserved in the Sendai City Museum and other museums in Sendai.|$|E
5|$|Codex Vaticanus {{originally}} {{contained a}} virtually complete {{copy of the}} Septuagint ("LXX"), lacking only 1-4 Maccabees and the Prayer of Manasseh.

5|$|During evolution, darts {{appear to}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> secondarily, i.e., {{after they had}} evolved and been functional. Vestigial darts (ones that exist only in a {{rudimentary}} condition) occur in the family Sagdidae, and in many Helicoidea, the surrounding organs have also degenerated (become non-functional). The sarcobelum is a fleshy or cuticle-coated papilla which {{is considered to be}} a degenerated, previously dart-bearing, organ.|$|E
5|$|In the 1630s, {{the texts}} of these annals were {{compiled}} into a single, enormous compendium, known as the Annals of the Four Masters. In the process, the authors sometimes modified the chronology and content {{of some of the}} materials, and is thus chronologically untrustworthy. However, it is recognised that they saved for posterity material that would otherwise <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost,</b> and the entry contains the longest annalistic account of the battle.|$|E
5|$|Knowledge of Roman history stands {{apart from}} other civilizations in the ancient world. Its chronicles, {{military}} and otherwise, document the city's very foundation to its eventual demise. Although some histories <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost,</b> such as Trajan's account of the Dacian Wars, and others, such as Rome's earliest histories, are at least semi-apocryphal, the extant histories of Rome's military history are extensive.|$|E

5|$|Since the Neolithic Revolution about 47% of the world's forests <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> {{to human}} use.

In temperate and boreal regions forest area is gradually increasing (with the exception of Siberia), but deforestation in the tropics is of major concern.|$|E
5|$|The {{fragment}} {{was found}} by itself in the topsoil near Roskilde. Though the larger helmet may have accompanied the eyepiece into the earth and later been destroyed by ploughing, the fragment may instead <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> or discarded. It could alternatively have been buried by itself, possibly in an invocation of the one-eyed god Odin.|$|E
5|$|The lectotype {{chosen for}} the species came from Marstrand, Sweden, but it is assumed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost.</b> In 1814, writing for The Edinburgh Encyclopaedia, William Elford Leach erected a new genus, Carcinus to hold this species alone (making it the type species of the genus, by monotypy). In 1847, Nardo {{described}} a distinct subspecies occurring in the Mediterranean Sea, which is now recognised as a distinct species, Carcinus aestuarii.|$|E
