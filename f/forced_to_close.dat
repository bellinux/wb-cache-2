Originally, the race tracks were scheduled to close with the first wave on July 1, but a State Court order allowed them to close later.

25|$|Metal toothed {{watertight}} zippers rely {{on pressure}} {{between the two}} rubberized contact surfaces of the zipper tapes alongside the teeth for sealing. To get this pressure, the slider needs to press the two faces together while closing, and this increases friction between the slider and the teeth, so the zipper requires more <b>force</b> <b>to</b> <b>close</b> than regular zippers. If the two rows of open teeth are lined up and close together {{in front of the}} pull it will prevent misalignment which can permanently damage the sealing edge, and allow the zipper <b>to</b> be <b>closed</b> with less effort. Friction can be reduced by suitable lubrication which is usually done with a waterproof wax or grease which remains on the zipper when wet. There should not be an excessive buildup of lubricant which would stick to particles of grit and cause wear and additional friction. The plastic tooth zippers have less friction than the metal teeth and need less <b>force</b> <b>to</b> <b>close.</b>|$|R

All Greek schools in the excluded area were <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>close</b> until 1935, in violation of obligations accepted by the Albanian government at the League of Nations. In 1925, Albania's present borders were set, leading Greece to abandon its claims to Northern Epirus.|$|E
5|$|In Tonga initial reports, {{suggested}} that only vegetation had been impacted. However, {{it was later}} reported that power lines had been knocked down by high winds and the heavy rains triggered minor flooding in Nuku'alofa.
