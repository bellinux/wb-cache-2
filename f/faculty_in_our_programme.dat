40|$|In {{this paper}} we extend our earlier work {{on science and}} {{engineering}} faculty disclosure and licensing activity to examine a characteristic of <b>faculty</b> ignored <b>in</b> <b>our</b> earlier work – the gender of <b>faculty</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> database of over 4500 faculty at 11 major universities. Not surprisingly, women comprise only 8. 55 % of the <b>faculty</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> sample. They are most represented in the biological sciences and {{the women in the}} sample {{are more likely to be}} younger faculty. The most striking result from highlighting women in the sample is that women are less likely to disclose inventions than men despite the fact that there are no significant differences in publication patterns. While disclosure activity varies by gender, we find that the disclosure activity of women and men converges over the period of our sample. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2005...|$|R

It is an old idea that confinement in Z(N) gauge theories can {{be understood in terms}} of Z(N) vortices (also called fluxons) linking with the Wilson loops (see e. g. [1]). In three dimensions 1 a Z(N) vortex is a closed stack of plaquettes (forming a loop) with a nontrivial Z(N) element on them. These are excitations very much analogous to Peierls contours in the 2 d Ising model. This vortex condensation mechanism was generalised to SU(N) gauge theories by Mack and Petkova [2].
