5|$|The Royalist expeditionary navy {{that would}} raid San Lorenzo {{comprised}} eleven ships of varying sizes, {{two hundred and}} fifty soldiers and fifty sailors. They moved into the Paraná through its tributary, the Paraná Guazú River, slowed down by <b>headwinds.</b> The Second Triumvirate promoted José de San Martín to colonel and instructed him to follow them with the Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers and stop the raids. San Martín was influenced by Napoleonic warfare and trained the regiment with the most recent military techniques used in the Napoleonic Wars.|$|E
5|$|Live {{television}} {{coverage of the}} race began at 3:30p.m. EST in the United States on Fox. Around {{the start of the}} race, weather conditions were sunny, between , and no rain was expected. Gusty winds from the north created strong <b>headwinds</b> on the back straight. Kenny Farmer, chaplain of Las Vegas Motor Speedway, began pre-race ceremonies with an invocation. Actress Carol Linnae Johnson of the stage production Mamma Mia! performed the national anthem, and John Byers, co-director of UAW-Chrysler National Training Center, commanded the drivers to start their engines. During the pace laps, two drivers moved {{to the rear of the}} field because of unapproved changes: Bowyer had switched to a back-up car, and Kahne had changed his engine.|$|E
5|$|Seventeen {{hours after}} lifting off at sunrise in Japan, the men {{began to see}} the sun rise again over the Yukon—it was a very short day for them, and none had been able to sleep for the {{excitement}} of the trip, the stimulant benzedrine, and the penetrating cold. Crossing into Canada, the <b>headwinds</b> grew stronger still, and a load of hard rime ice and clear ice was visible on the wings. Though the B-29s had been delivered to the war front complete with deicing equipment, such gear had been removed months before to reduce weight and therefore increase combat range and speed. The ice load picked up in the night would have to be endured until it melted off at lower altitudes.|$|E
50|$|In aeronautics, a <b>headwind</b> is {{favorable}} in takeoffs and landings {{because an}} airfoil {{moving into a}} <b>headwind</b> is capable of generating greater lift than the same airfoil moving through tranquil air or a tailwind at equal ground speed. As a result, aviators and air traffic controllers commonly choose to take off or land {{in the direction of}} a runway that will provide a <b>headwind.</b> In sailing, a <b>headwind</b> may make forward movement difficult, and necessitate tacking into the wind.|$|R
50|$|In early 2000, EUROCONTROL started researching Time Based Separation (TBS), a new {{operating}} procedure for separating aircraft by time during strong <b>headwind</b> conditions, instead of distance. TBS addresses <b>headwind</b> disruptions {{by reducing the}} spacing between pairs of aircraft.|$|R

5|$|When news of {{the arrival}} of Duperré's {{squadron}} reached Decaen at Port Napoleon, he immediately despatched fast couriers to Grand Port and ordered Hamelin's squadron, consisting of the frigates Vénus, Manche, Astrée and the brig Entreprenant, to make ready to sail in support of Duperré. Hamelin departed Port Napoleon at midnight on 21 August, intending to sail northeast and then south, down the island's eastern shore. On 23 August, Hamelin's squadron spotted and captured a British transport ship named Ranger, sent 24 days earlier from the Cape of Good Hope with 300 tons of food supplies and extensive naval stores for Rowley on Île Bourbon. On rounding the northern headlands of Isle de France, however, Hamelin found he could make no progress against the <b>headwinds</b> and reversed direction, passing the western shore of the island and arriving off Grand Port at 1:00 pm on 27 August.|$|E
5|$|Rowley {{first learned}} of the {{operations}} off Grand Port on 22 August, when Windham arrived off Saint Paul. Eager to support Pym's attack, Rowley immediately set sail in his frigate HMS Boadicea, with the transport Bombay following with two companies of the 86th Regiment of Foot to provide a garrison on any territory seized in the operation. The <b>headwinds</b> were strong {{and it was not}} until 29 August that Rowley arrived off Grand Port, having been notified of the situation there by Magiciennes launch the previous day. Sighting a cluster of frigates around Île de la Passe, Rowley closed with the island before turning sharply when Vénus and Manche raised their colours and gave chase. Rowley repeatedly feinted towards the French ships and then pulled away, hoping to draw them away from Grand Port in the hope that Bombay might board the now unprotected Iphigenia and capture her. Bombay was thwarted by the reappearance of Astrée and Entreprenant and Rowley was chased by Vénus and Manche back to Saint Denis, anchoring there on 30 August. Rowley attempted a second time to rescue Iphigenia from Grand Port the following week, {{but by the time he}} returned Bellone and Minerve had been refloated and the French force was far too strong for Rowley's flagship to attack alone.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{flight crew}} {{was replaced with}} a new one at Albuquerque. A refueling stop had been planned in Winslow, Arizona, because of the higher passenger load and forecast <b>headwinds.</b> The captain however decided while en route to skip the Winslow stop and to proceed directly to Las Vegas.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>headwind</b> {{reduces the}} landing {{distance}} for an aircraft. Landing into a <b>headwind</b> reduces the Ground Speed (GS) {{for the same}} TAS. [...] This is beneficial to pilots as well as Air traffic controllers (ATC). An aircraft landing into a <b>headwind</b> will require less runway and {{will be able to}} vacate the runway sooner. If the <b>headwind</b> decreases near the ground, there's a decrease in the performance of the aircraft and it will tend to sink and possibly under shoot the aiming point.Tailwind increases the Ground Speed of an aircraft for the same TAS and thus a longer runway distance will be required for an aircraft to land. Landing in a tailwind situation could lead to the aircraft over shooting the runway and colliding with objects or terrain.|$|R

25|$|After {{making the}} first South American {{flight of the}} 1937 season in late March, Hindenburg left Frankfurt for Lakehurst {{on the evening of}} May 3, on its first {{scheduled}} round trip between Europe and North America that season. Although strong <b>headwinds</b> slowed the crossing, the flight had otherwise proceeded routinely as it approached for a landing three days later.|$|E
25|$|The Temecula Duck Pond is {{also home}} to an art piece {{entitled}} Singing in the Rain. It was commissioned by the city of Leidschendam-Voorburg as a gift to the city to commemorate the resilient American spirit {{in the aftermath of the}} September 11 attacks. The piece depicts a mother and her children bravely pedalling a bicycle into the strong <b>headwinds</b> of a storm.|$|E
25|$|The {{regularly}} scheduled flight departed New York City’s LaGuardia Field at 7:00 p.m. Eastern time on January 5. After battling abnormally high <b>headwinds,</b> the flight made routine stops in Pittsburgh and Knoxville. While in Knoxville, {{the captain was}} briefed on the latest weather in Birmingham and elected to continue the flight. The flight left Knoxville at 2:51 a.m. Eastern time. Considerable turbulence was experienced between Knoxville and Birmingham due to active thunderstorms throughout the South.|$|E
40|$|Ground level runway wind {{statistics}} are presented for the Kennedy Space Center, Florida area. Crosswind, <b>headwind,</b> tailwind, and <b>headwind</b> reversal percentage frequencies are given {{with respect to}} month and hour for the Kennedy Space Center Space Shuttle runway. This document supersedes NASA CR- 128995 and {{should be used in}} place of it...|$|R
50|$|Ground speed can be {{determined}} by the vector sum of the aircraft's true airspeed and the current wind speed and direction; a <b>headwind</b> subtracts from the ground speed, while a tailwind adds to it. Winds at other angles to the heading will have components of either <b>headwind</b> or tailwind as well as a crosswind component.|$|R
50|$|Apparent wind {{velocity}} is the vector {{sum of the}} true wind and the <b>headwind</b> an object would experience in still air. The <b>headwind</b> velocity in still air is inverse of the objects velocity, therefore the apparent wind can also {{be defined as a}} vector subtraction: the Velocity of the wind minus the Velocity of the object.|$|R
25|$|Rowing in <b>headwinds</b> or even {{moderately}} rough {{weather was}} difficult {{as well as}} exhausting. In high seas, ancient galleys would set sail to run before the wind. They were highly susceptible to high waves, and could become unmanageable if the rowing frame (apostis) came awash. Ancient and medieval galleys are assumed to have sailed only with the wind more or less astern with {{a top speed of}} 8-9 knots in fair conditions.|$|E
25|$|Before Cody {{could turn}} his newfound skills to aeroplanes, he was {{required}} to help complete an airship then under construction in the Farnborough Airship Shed. In December 1906, he was despatched to France, where he purchased a 40hp Antoinette engine. During 1907, he was given full authority as the designer of the airship's understructure and propulsion system. On 5 October 1907, Britain's first powered airship British Army Dirigible No 1 Nulli Secundus, flew from Farnborough to London in 3 hours 25 minutes, with Cody and his commanding officer Colonel J E Capper on board. After circling St Paul's Cathedral, they attempted to return to Farnborough, but 18mph <b>headwinds</b> forced them to land at Crystal Palace. There, the airship was damaged by the high winds.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} summer of 1933, Carpenter {{commanded}} the ferry flight of the first division of Patrol Squadron 5F (VP-5F) from NAS Norfolk, Virginia to FAB Coco Solo. Carpenter flew 5-P-2, one of six Consolidated P2Y-1 flying boats that departed Norfolk mid-way through the first dog watch on September 7, 1933 (accompanied personally during {{the initial stages of}} the flight by Rear Admiral Ernest J. King, Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, in a Vought SU-1) and reached its destination, a little over halfway through the second dog watch the next day, having covered the 1,788 nautical miles (3,311km) in a total elapsed time of 25hours and 29minutes. In the longest non-stop formation seaplane flight in history, the six flying boats battled <b>headwinds</b> for almost the entire aerial voyage, at one point encountering a heavy squall with velocity approaching 50knots (90km/h).|$|E

25|$|In Operation Orator, during September 1942, {{the crews}} of 32 Hampden TB.1 torpedo bombers from No. 144 Squadron RAF and No. 455 Squadron RAAF flew to Northwest Russia, to protect arctic convoy PQ 18 from German surface vessels, such the {{battleship}} Tirpitz. The Hampden crews flew from Sumburgh in the Shetland Islands to Vaenga (Vayenga; later known as Severomorsk) in Murmansk Oblast, Russia. This was a hazardous route, often subject to poor weather and spanning more than , partly over enemy-occupied territory in Norway and Finland. Eight Hampdens were lost or {{damaged beyond repair}} en route. 144 and 455 Squadrons flew {{a small number of}} sorties from Vaenga. While it was originally intended that the Hampdens would be flown back to Scotland, the prevailing west-east <b>headwinds</b> on such a flight might have pushed the Hampdens beyond their maximum endurance and it was decided to transport the wing's personnel back to Britain by sea and gift the Hampdens to the Soviet Navy.|$|E
25|$|LeMay piloted one {{of three}} {{specially}} modified B-29s flying from Japan to the U.S. in September 1945, in the process breaking several aviation records at that date, including the greatest USAAF takeoff weight, the longest USAAF non-stop flight, and the first ever non-stop Japan–Chicago flight. One of the pilots was of higher rank: Lieutenant General Barney M. Giles. The other two aircraft used up more fuel than LeMay's in fighting <b>headwinds,</b> and they could not fly to Washington, D.C., the original goal. Their pilots decided to land in Chicago to refuel. LeMay's aircraft had sufficient fuel to reach Washington, but he was directed by the War Department to join the others by refueling at Chicago. The order was ostensibly given because of borderline weather conditions in Washington, but according to First Lieutenant Ivan J. Potts who was on board, the order came because LeMay had one fewer general's stars {{and should not be}} seen to outperform his superior.|$|E
25|$|On June 5, 2013, {{one of the}} {{unmanned}} K-MAX helicopters {{crashed in}} Afghanistan while resupplying Marines. No injuries occurred and the crash was investigated. Pilot error was ruled out, as the aircraft was flying autonomously to a predetermined point. The crash happened during {{the final stages of}} cargo delivery. Operational flights of the remaining unmanned K-MAX were suspended following the crash, with the Navy saying it could resume flying by late August. Swing load was seen as the prime cause. The investigation determined that the crash was not caused by mechanical problems, but by unexpected tailwinds. As the helicopter was making the delivery, it experienced tailwinds instead of <b>headwinds,</b> causing it to begin oscillating. Operators employed a weathervane effect to try and regain control, but its 2,000 lb load began to swing, which exacerbated the effect and caused it to contact the ground. The crash report determined {{that it could have been}} prevented if pilots intervened earlier and mission planners received updated weather reports; diverging conditions and insufficient programming meant it could not recover on its own and required human intervention.|$|E

They had expected tailwinds from the jet stream, yet could complete the distance without them, but <b>headwinds</b> meant that Washington might be too far. At 7am Eastern War Time, aircraft Number 2 was over Northway, Alaska, and navigator Bill Townes determined that they were behind schedule. He said later, [...] "When I reported that fact to General LeMay, {{he looked at me}} as if he thought it was my fault, so I retreated behind my bulkhead to check my figures." [...] Later, the airmen learned that the typhoon near Okinawa the week before had greatly affected the jet stream.|$|E
500|$|Originally {{intending}} to fly [...] nonstop to Washington, D.C., the airmen encountered unexpected <b>headwinds</b> over Alaska Territory and Canada, and they predicted {{that two of}} the aircraft would not have enough fuel to take them the full distance.
