5|$|Each {{enemy was}} {{designed}} to exhibit a unique behavior toward the character; random elements were programmed into the enemies' behaviors to make the game more interesting. The first two designed were the simplest: Electrodes and <b>Grunts.</b> Electrodes are stationary objects that are lethal to the in-game characters, and <b>Grunts</b> are simple robots that chase the protagonist by plotting the shortest path to him. <b>Grunts</b> were designed to overwhelm the player with large groups. While testing the game with the new control system and the two enemies, Jarvis and DeMar were impressed by the gameplay's excitement and fun. As a result, they began steadily {{increasing the number of}} on-screen enemies to over a hundred to see if more enemies would generate more enjoyment.|$|E

5|$|The California condor has a {{long life}} span, {{reaching}} up to 60 years. If it survives to adulthood, the condor has few natural threats other than humans. Because they lack a syrinx, their vocal display is limited to <b>grunts</b> and hisses. Condors bathe frequently and can spend hours a day preening their feathers. Condors also perform urohidrosis, or defecate on their legs, to reduce their body temperature. There is a well-developed social structure within large groups of condors, with competition to determine a pecking order decided by body language, competitive play behavior, {{and a variety of}} hisses and <b>grunts.</b> This social hierarchy is displayed especially when the birds feed, with the dominant birds eating before the younger ones.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins with}} a cold open in which Wes infiltrates and destroys the Team Snagem hideout before leaving the organization. Wes starts at the Outskirt Stand, a {{dilapidated}} train engine {{in the middle of}} the desert that has been converted into a shop. With Espeon and Umbreon, Wes's first opponent is a Trainer named Willie. Wes then leaves the Stand and heads to the oasis-esque Phenac City in time to see two men dragging a sack. After defeating them in battle, Wes unties the sack to find Rui, a girl with the ability to discern Shadow Pokémon. They meet the mayor, Es Cade, who seems very bothered about the Cipher problem, but seems to do nothing about it. Later, upon leaving Phenac Colosseum, three Snagem <b>grunts</b> find Wes and Rui. The <b>grunts</b> then reveal to Rui that he was a member of Snagem, and an excellent Snagger. Wes then confronts one of the <b>grunts,</b> which results in the latter's defeat. Finding out that he is an expert at snagging Pokémon, Rui asks him to join forces with her in finding and snagging Shadow Pokémon.|$|E
5|$|Three {{types of}} habitats, mangroves, reefs and seagrasses, {{are found in}} Puerto Rico's ocean waters. A total of 677 fish species live in these habitats; 242 being reef species. Fish species found in Puerto Rican reefs are {{representative}} of the general Caribbean fauna. Common reef fishes include wrasses, damselfishes, white <b>grunts</b> (Haemulon plumieri), bluestriped <b>grunts</b> (Haemulon sciurus), queen parrotfish (Scarus vetula), and sharks (family Carcharhinidae). Sea breams (Archosargus rhomboidalis) and yellowfin mojarras (Gerres cinereus) are some of the species commonly found in mangrove habitats. Other species of interest include flatfishes, with 21 recorded species, and sharks, with more than 20 species. Oceanic whitetip sharks and silky sharks are common in the Mona Passage.|$|E
50|$|<b>Grunt</b> {{appeared}} in the original G.I. Joe animated series. <b>Grunt</b> is first seen in the A Real American Hero mini-series of the Sunbow-produced G.I. Joe animated series. However, much of the series’ focus was on the newer characters and <b>Grunt</b> was quickly shunted to the background. His final appearance in that series was in two-part Worlds Without End where the Joe Team find themselves in an alternate universe where Cobra is victorious in ruling the world. After finding out the fate of that universe’s <b>Grunt,</b> the series’ <b>Grunt,</b> along with Steeler and Clutch, elected to stay behind and win the world back from Cobra.|$|R

5|$|After the rut, females form large {{herds of}} up to 50 individuals. Newborn calves are kept close {{by a series of}} vocalizations; larger {{nurseries}} have an ongoing and constant chatter during the daytime hours. When approached by predators, the largest and most robust females may make a stand, using their front legs to kick at their attackers. Guttural <b>grunts</b> and posturing effectively deter all but the most determined predators.|$|E
5|$|Hippopotamuses {{appear to}} {{communicate}} vocally, through <b>grunts</b> and bellows, {{and they may}} practice echolocation, but {{the purpose of these}} vocalizations is currently unknown. Hippos have the unique ability to hold their heads partially above the water and send out a cry that travels through both water and air; individuals respond above and under water. Hippos will also express threat and alarm with exhalations.|$|E
5|$|The front toes {{are long}} with small webs at their bases {{and are not}} adapted to grasping. The opening of the nostril is {{longitudinal}} and set in a soft cere, and the nostril lack a septum. Like all New World vultures, the greater yellow-headed vulture lacks a syrinx, and is therefore unable to make any sound other than <b>grunts</b> or a low hiss.|$|E

40|$|In the spawing season, sound {{production}} of captive walleye pollock Theragra chalcogramma (Pallas) was {{examined by the}} <b>grunt</b> call projection method. The pollock emitted four patterns of <b>grunt</b> calls, namely threatening call, aggressive-attacking call, courting call, and mating call. The sound frequency of these <b>grunt</b> calls is less than 800 Hz. The characteristics of walleye pollock behaviour matching each <b>grunt</b> call are as follows: (1) Only one threatening <b>grunt</b> call was emitted by the superior male to threaten other males encountered. (2) Aggressive-attacking <b>grunt</b> calls were emitted from two to five times in order to drive out other males from the male's occupied space. Behaviour included chasing, dorsal mounting and lateral mounting. (3) Courting calls were emitted from six to twelve times in order to court other males and females which are characterized by swimming faster than usual. The behaviour included chasing, dorsal mounting and lateral mounting. (4) Mating <b>grunt</b> calls were made more than thirteen times in order to mate with mature females. Behaviour included chasing, and dorsal, lateral and ventral mounting...|$|R

5|$|Due to the {{technological}} {{limitations of the}} Game Boy Advance cartridge size, voice acting was kept to a minimum. Though many characters from Kingdom Hearts were voiced by the cast from before, the Japanese version used the following voice actors: Keiji Fujiwara as Axel; Tatsuya Kando as Vexen, Marluxia, and Lexaeus; and Rieko Katayama as Larxene. A limited amount of voice acting was added only for the battle sequences. Voice clips from the first Kingdom Hearts were inserted into Chain of Memories. The English version is absent of dialogue; voices during Organization battles are replaced with simple <b>grunts,</b> laughter, and other battle cries.|$|E
5|$|In {{the novels}} Halo: Fall of Reach and Halo: The Flood, it is {{told that the}} <b>Grunts</b> are methane {{breathers}} and described as dog-like. They have methane suits {{that allow them to}} remove the breathing apparatuses they usually wear to sustain them in a non-methane atmosphere. In Halo Reach, if a player kills a Grunt in a particular way, their methane tank will ignite causing them to fly and bounce around the area out of control, causing damage if they hit the player.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} big cats, the jaguar is capable of roaring and does so to warn {{territorial}} and mating competitors away; intensive bouts of counter-calling between individuals have been observed in the wild. Their roar often resembles a repetitive cough, and they may also vocalize mews and <b>grunts.</b> Mating fights between males occur, but are rare, and aggression avoidance behavior has been observed in the wild. When it occurs, conflict is typically over territory: a male's range may encompass that {{of two or three}} females, and he will not tolerate intrusions by other adult males.|$|E

40|$|The Panama <b>grunt</b> is an {{abundant}} and commercially important {{species in the}} southeastern Gulf of California, but the research undertaken on this species is scarce despite its ecological and economic importance. We studied the feeding habits of Panama <b>grunt</b> through stomach content analyses {{as a first step}} towards understanding the biology of this species in the study area. Our results indicate that the Panama <b>grunt</b> is a benthic predator throughout its life cycle and feeds mainly on infaunal crustaceans. Diet differences among <b>grunt</b> were not found according to size, diet, or season. Shannon diversity index results indicate that Panama <b>grunt</b> has a limited trophic niche breadth with a diet dominated by a limited number of taxa as crustaceans. The estimated trophic level of this species is 3. 59. Overall, the Panama <b>grunt</b> is a carnivorous fish occupying the intermediate levels of the trophic pyramid...|$|R
5|$|River otters {{can produce}} a snarling growl or hissing bark when bothered, and a shrill whistle when in pain. When at play or traveling, they {{sometimes}} give off low, purring <b>grunts.</b> The alarm call, given when shocked or distressed by potential danger, is an explosive snort, made by expelling air through the nostrils. River otters also may use a birdlike chirp for communication over longer distances, but the most common sound heard {{among a group of}} otters is low-frequency chuckling.|$|E
5|$|The calls made by caecilians and {{salamanders}} {{are limited}} to occasional soft squeaks, <b>grunts</b> or hisses and have not been much studied. A clicking sound sometimes produced by caecilians may be a means of orientation, as in bats, or a form of communication. Most salamanders are considered voiceless, but the California giant salamander (Dicamptodon ensatus) has vocal cords and can produce a rattling or barking sound. Some species of salamander emit a quiet squeak or yelp if attacked.|$|E
5|$|The {{child would}} grow up healthy, but {{with some of the}} {{behaviours}} of a pig. She would eat from a silver trough, and speak only in <b>grunts</b> or with a grunting sound to her speech. The only child of her parents, she would stand to inherit a large fortune, but her parents would be concerned about what would become of her after their death. They would thus make arrangements either to find a man willing to marry her, or to use their fortune to endow a hospital on condition that the hospital take care of her for the remainder of her life.|$|E
50|$|Tools are to {{be picked}} up by Gruntz to use in battle or for puzzle solving purposes. Each tool does a certain amount of damage. The weakest tool is nothing at all, also called barehands. There are several ways of getting a barehand <b>Grunt,</b> which include freshly created Gruntz, or a Boomerang <b>Grunt</b> that forgot to catch the boomerang. The only <b>Grunt</b> a Barehanded can defeat is another bare hand if he strikes first. The strongest weapon is the Timebombs, which kills any Gruntz within the 1 square radius (including the <b>Grunt</b> himself if he's not careful). Most weapons can be used for other purposes, such as walking over spikes, swimming, {{breaking}} objects or digging holes. A <b>grunt</b> can only have one tool at a time.|$|R
50|$|Figurines are {{generally}} forward-compatible with subsequent games. Figurines for new characters are not backward compatible, but new versions of earlier characters are. For example: a Spyro's Adventure Gill <b>Grunt</b> is playable in all games; Trap Team Tidal Wave Gill <b>Grunt</b> will appear as normal Gill <b>Grunt</b> {{in the earlier}} three games, but will have an extra power in Trap Team and later.|$|R
50|$|Gulp.js is a {{relatively}} new JavaScript based task runner tool. It is similar to <b>Grunt</b> since both follow a modular-based architecture and are based on npm. Gulp tasks are defined by code rather than configuration. Gulp is faster than <b>Grunt.</b> <b>Grunt</b> uses temporary files to transfer output from one task to another whereas in Gulp files are piped between the tasks.|$|R
