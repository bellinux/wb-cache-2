5|$|Current {{sea level}} rise, {{increased}} cyclonic activity, increased ambient temperatures, and increasingly fickle precipitation patterns are {{effects of global}} warming that have affected or are projected to impact India. Thousands of people <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>displaced</b> by ongoing sea level rises that have submerged low-lying islands in the Sundarbans. Temperature rises on the Tibetan Plateau are causing Himalayan glaciers to retreat, threatening the flow rate of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Yamuna, and other major rivers; the livelihoods {{of hundreds of thousands}} of farmers depend on these rivers. A 2007 World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) report states that the Indus River may run dry for the same reason.|$|E
5|$|The Earth's {{geography}} is also radically altered. A new mountain range {{was formed in}} Britain by a day-long ice age, and the Earth now has twelve and a half continents. Many locations <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>displaced</b> and reduced to islands, including Oxford University and the London borough of Deptford, which {{is now in the}} Indonesian Ocean {{as a part of the}} Cockney Islands. The solar system is equally altered: Jupiter has been deep fried by Harry Ramsden's, Mercury and Neptune have been knocked together, and there was an initiative to destroy the Moon, which according to the show was deleterious to the nightlight industry.|$|E
5|$|Among the Ainu, the otter {{is portrayed}} as an {{occasional}} messenger between humans and the creator. The sea otter is a recurring figure in Ainu folklore. A major Ainu epic, the Kutune Shirka, tells the tale of wars and struggles over a golden sea otter. Versions of a widespread Aleut legend tell of lovers or despairing women who plunge into the sea and become otters. These links {{have been associated with}} the many human-like behavioral features of the sea otter, including apparent playfulness, strong mother-pup bonds and tool use, yielding to ready anthropomorphism. The beginning of commercial exploitation had a great impact on the human, as well as animal, populations the Ainu and Aleuts <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>displaced</b> or their numbers are dwindling, while the coastal tribes of North America, where the otter is in any case greatly depleted, no longer rely as intimately on sea mammals for survival.|$|E

5|$|Since the 19th century, {{humans have}} {{impacted}} Banff's environment through introduction of non-native species, controls on other species, {{and development in}} the Bow Valley, among other human activities. Bison once lived in the valleys of Banff, but were hunted by indigenous people and the last bison were killed off in 1850s. In 2017 a small herd of sixteen plains Bison were reintroduced into an eastern section of the park. Elk are not indigenous to Banff, and were introduced in 1917 with 57 elk brought in from Yellowstone National Park. The introduction of elk to Banff, combined with controls on coyote and wolves by Parks Canada beginning in the 1930s, has caused imbalance of the ecosystem. Other species that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>displaced</b> from the Bow Valley include grizzly bears, cougars, lynx, wolverine, otter, and moose. Beginning in 1985, gray wolves were recolonizing areas in the Bow Valley. However, the wolf population has struggled, with 32 wolf deaths along the Trans-Canada Highway between 1987 and 2000, leaving only 31 wolves in the area.|$|E
25|$|Displacement is a {{long lasting}} reality for most {{refugees}}. Two-thirds of all refugees around the world <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>displaced</b> for over three years, which is known as being in 'protracted displacement'. 50% of refugees– around 10 million people– <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>displaced</b> for over ten years.|$|E

Refugees {{from places like}} the Sudan have helped further strain the resources of neighboring states like the Chad and Egypt. The nation is also host to roughly 255,000 refugees from Sudan’s Darfur region, and about 77,000 refugees from the Central African Republic, whilst approximately 188,000 Chadians <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>displaced</b> by their own civil war and famines, have either fled to either the Sudan, the Niger or, more recently, Libya.|$|E
25|$|Throughout history, {{different}} states designate the groups within their boundaries that {{are recognized as}} indigenous peoples according to international or national legislation by different terms. Indigenous people also include people indigenous based on their descent from populations that inhabited the country when non-indigenous religions and cultures arrived—or at the establishment of present state boundaries—who retain {{some or all of}} their own social, economic, cultural and political institutions, but who may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>displaced</b> from their traditional domains or who may have resettled outside their ancestral domains.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{significant}} contribution of the Mixtec language to Mexican Spanish is {{in the field of}} place names, particularly in the western regions of the state of Oaxaca, where several communities are still known by Mixtec names (joined with a saint's name): San Juan Ñumí, San Bartolo Yucuañe, Santa Cruz Itundujia, and many more. In Puebla and Guerrero, Mixtec place names <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>displaced</b> by Nahuatl and Spanish names. An example is Yucu Yuxin (in Puebla), which is now known as Gabino Barreda.|$|E

25|$|Eventually all the Mesozoic {{rock from}} the Teton Range was {{stripped}} away and the same formations in Jackson Hole were deeply buried. A prominent outcrop of the pink-colored Flathead Sandstone exits 6,000 feet (1,830 m) above the valley floor on the summit of Mount Moran. Drilling in Jackson Hole found the same formation 24,000 feet (7,300 m) below the valley's surface, indicating that the two blocks <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>displaced</b> 30,000 feet (9,100 m) from each other. Thus an average of one foot of movement occurred every 300 years (1cm per year on average).|$|E
25|$|Darfur {{has been}} rife with {{conflict}} since 2003, when rebels took up arms against the Sudanese government, accusing it of discriminating and neglecting {{the needs of}} the region, as well as extorting of state funds. The government is accused of retaliating with ethnic Arab forces on the area, which the government ardently denies. The U.N. estimates 300,000 people have been killed and roughly 2.7 million <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>displaced</b> in the war. Union peacekeepers began occupying Darfur in 2005 and were later reinforced by additional UN troops in 2007. The peacekeeping force has been frequently attacked although violence as a whole has declined. The occupying force has limited Al-Bashir's ability to extort funds.|$|E
25|$|A {{suspended}} Slinky's {{centre of}} mass is accelerating downward at 16 feet per second (i.e. g); when released - the lower portion moves up toward the top portion with an equivalent, constant upward acceleration as the tension is relieved. As the spring contracts, every point along its length will accelerate downward with gravity and tension, and experience a decrease in overall downward acceleration related to height along the spring due to the spring force changing with extension- {{at the bottom of}} the spring the upward initial acceleration reduces in accordance with Hooke's law as the spring contracts, but the centre toward which it is moving gets closer- meaning the base will <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>displaced</b> sufficiently toward the centre of inertial mass for it to appear to have hung still. Should this phenomenology extend to very light strings with heavy suspended masses (which have approximately linear tension distributions), different mathematics would be needed to explain the phenomenon.|$|E
