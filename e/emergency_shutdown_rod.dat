40|$|The Master Thesis {{performs}} search concerning advanced {{small and}} medium power light-water reactors’ designs, including different possibilities {{to gain a}} license for their development and operation. The work covers the principal theory about the area of neutronics calculations, principal equations and simplifications. There are several different methods for solution of neutronics calculations. The thesis gives an overview of two principal groups of codes – deterministic methods and Monte Carlo method. The survey shows computational codes examples based on mentioned methods. The computational code PARCS is chosen for further study, which contained description of the input and output file, process of the model creation and conditions for neutronics calculation the of selected reactor design. Based on these facts, the transient calculation has been prepared within the thesis. Thee analyses are described – reactor <b>emergency</b> <b>shutdown,</b> reactor shutdown with stuck group of control and <b>emergency</b> <b>shutdown</b> <b>rods</b> and reactor <b>shutdown</b> with faulty reaction of <b>emergency</b> <b>shutdown</b> <b>rods...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of the blade-pitch fault and <b>emergency</b> <b>shutdown</b> on {{drivetrain}} responses in a 5 -MW bottom-fixed wind turbine are investigated. A 5 -MW reference gearbox with 4 -point support is employed and the decoupled analysis approach is used for the load effect analysis. The effect of this fault event is then investigated for all bearings and gears inside the gearbox as well as main bearings. The results show that the blade-pitch fault creates significant axial forces on main bearings which increases the nontorque force entering the gearbox. Due to the <b>emergency</b> <b>shutdown,</b> the rotor torque reversal occurs which causes force reversals in gears. The main bearings are more affected than gears and bearings inside the gearbox in this fault condition and <b>emergency</b> <b>shutdown,</b> but first-stage bearings may also be considerably affected. It is therefore recommended to conduct a thorough inspection of main bearings and first stage bearings in case of such blade-pitch fault condition and <b>emergency</b> <b>shutdown...</b>|$|R

40|$|A rigid flap-lag blade {{analysis}} {{was developed to}} simulate a rotor in a wind tunnel undergoing an <b>emergency</b> power <b>shutdown.</b> Results show that for a rotor at a nonzero shaft tilt angle undergoing an <b>emergency</b> power <b>shutdown,</b> the oscillatory lag response is divergent. The mean lag response is large when tested at high collective pitch angles. Reducing the collective pitch during the <b>emergency</b> <b>shutdown</b> reduces the steady lag response. Increasing the rotor shaft tilt angle increases the oscillatory lag response component. The blade lag response obtained by incorporating a nonlinear lag damper model indicates {{that in this case}} the equivalent linear viscous damping is lower than originally expected. Simulation results indicate that large oscillatory lag motions can be suppressed if the rotor shaft is returned to the fully vertical position during the <b>emergency</b> power <b>shutdown...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Emergency</b> <b>shutdown</b> {{is always}} a {{challenge}} for an operating {{vertical axis wind turbine}}. A 5 -MW vertical axis wind turbine with a Darrieus rotor mounted on a semi-submersible support structure was examined in this study. Coupled non-linear aero-hydro-servo-elastic simulations of the floating vertical axis wind turbine were carried out for <b>emergency</b> <b>shutdown</b> cases over a range of environmental conditions based on correlated wind and wave data. When generator failure happens, a brake should be applied to stop the acceleration of the rotor to prevent the rotor from overspeeding and subsequent disaster. In addition to the traditional mechanical brake, a novel hydrodynamic brake was presented to apply to the shutdown case. The effects of the hydrodynamic brake on the platform motions and structural loads under normal operating conditions and during the <b>emergency</b> <b>shutdown</b> events were evaluated. The use of both the hydrodynamic brake and mechanical brake was also investigated. The application of the hydrodynamic brake is expected to be efficient for rotor shutdown and for reducing the platform motions and structural loads. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
