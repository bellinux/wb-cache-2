40|$|This paper {{presents}} the methodology developed {{to create a}} system to evaluate academic <b>electronic</b> <b>journals.</b> This methodology was developed in two stages. In the first stage, a system to evaluate <b>electronic</b> <b>journals</b> was created. The criteria framework and the indicators for assessment for academic <b>electronic</b> <b>journals</b> were selected and defined. According to this framework, several questions were designed to measure each indicator and, as a result, an instrument to evaluate academic <b>electronic</b> <b>journals</b> was built. In the second stage, this instrument was validated by 16 editors of <b>electronic</b> <b>journals</b> of different countries and different areas of knowledge that were considered as judges to evaluate clarity, importance, relevance and coverage of each question, indicator and criteria. This instrument was distributed by e‑mail. The opinions given by the judges were processed and then used {{to help in the}} construction of a new instrument that is ready to be presented to the Mexican Council of Scientific Research in order to evaluate Mexican academic <b>electronic</b> <b>journals...</b>|$|R
5|$|The MIT {{library system}} {{consists}} of five subject libraries: Barker (Engineering), Dewey (Economics), Hayden (Humanities and Science), Lewis (Music), and Rotch (Arts and Architecture). There are also various specialized libraries and archives. The libraries contain more than 2.9 million printed volumes, 2.4 million microforms, 49,000 print or <b>electronic</b> <b>journal</b> subscriptions, and 670 reference databases. The {{past decade has}} seen a trend of increased focus on digital over print resources in the libraries. Notable collections include the Lewis Music Library {{with an emphasis on}} 20th and 21st-century music and electronic music, the List Visual Arts Center's rotating exhibitions of contemporary art, and the Compton Gallery's cross-disciplinary exhibitions. MIT allocates a percentage of the budget for all new construction and renovation to commission and support its extensive public art and outdoor sculpture collection.|$|E

40|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>journals</b> in {{scholarly}} or professional settings continue {{a tradition of}} fostering the creation and transmission of scientific and other knowledge that was begun long ago through print <b>journals.</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>journals</b> provide publishers and readers an opportunity for wider dissemination of knowledge than was previously possible through print publicationsa factor that may largely account for the increasing success of <b>electronic</b> <b>journals.</b> Besides this overriding benefit, <b>electronic</b> <b>journals</b> can incorporate features that improve on or go beyond the features that have traditionally been available in print publications. Following some background information on electronic publications, this article discusses issues involved in writing for <b>electronic</b> <b>journals,</b> particularly Early Childhood Research & Practice (ECRP). Topics discussed include hypertext links, graphics, audio and video, post-publication comments and discussions (for example, via Chat rooms), access to downloadable data files, electronic review, and correction of errors.

40|$|The {{number of}} <b>electronic</b> <b>journals</b> has grown {{steadily}} in the 1990 s. A {{large part of}} this increase has been in scholarly or academic <b>electronic</b> <b>journals.</b> Some academics are very aware of these trends in scholarly communication and participate actively in their production. Other academics remain unaware of these new trends. This study examines two related issues [...] 1. What is {{the growth rate of}} these scholarly <b>electronic</b> <b>journals?</b> 2. What are the factors which affect acceptance or resistance toward <b>electronic</b> <b>journals</b> among academics? Is it possible to discover a difference between disciplines for these factors of acceptance or resistance? Information or answers to these issues will help academic librarians and researchers anticipate trends in serials collection and subscription, and help in financial planning and budgeting. Two methodologies are used: 1) the collection of numbers, and 2) the use of a survey. The research project will collect information on the number of scholarly <b>electronic</b> <b>journals,</b> newsletters, and other electronic communications, as they have changed over time, in order to show trends and growth rates.

25|$|AGU co-published (along {{with the}} AMS and the AAG) its first <b>electronic</b> <b>journal,</b> Earth Interactions, in 1997. It started its own <b>electronic</b> <b>journal,</b> Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems, in December 1999. It made a full {{transition}} to electronic publishing in 2001. For all its journals, the electronic version became {{the publication of}} record. This {{was accompanied by a}} new identification scheme for articles that entirely did away with sequential page numbers. Instead, each article had a digital object identifier (DOI). As an example, 10.1029/2001GL014304 consists of the publisher identifier (AGU), the year (2001), the journal code (GL), and an article number (014304). This new system was met with complaints from libraries and scientists. The article numbers provided no clue for libraries to find an article in printed versions, and even scientific databases were not set up to handle DOIs. AGU officials claimed that the problems were a temporary cost of being a frontrunner, but did retroactively assign each article a four-digit article number.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to find out the level of {{awareness}} and use of e-journals by members of academic staff of the Dar es Salaam University College of Education (DUCE). A questionnaire was used as the main method for data collection and was supplemented by interview and observation methods. The findings revealed that the level of use of scholarly <b>electronic</b> <b>journals</b> was low and the use of search engines such as Google was high amongst members of academic staff. It was further revealed that, scholarly <b>electronic</b> <b>journals</b> were mainly used by members of academic staff for research and academic purposes. It is however found that, lack of awareness and limited searching skills were the main factors which were militating against effective use of scholarly <b>electronic</b> <b>journals.</b> In order to improve and maximize the optimum usage of scholarly <b>electronic</b> <b>journals</b> by members of academic staff, the study recommends the following: the institution should employ proactive marketing strategies such as the use of calendars, newsletters, posters, workshops/training, flyers and brochures, website; conduct training on the use of scholarly <b>electronic</b> <b>journals</b> databases and subscribe to relevant scholarly <b>electronic</b> <b>journals...</b>|$|R

The {{objective is to}} understand the internal structure of technological practices {{in the context of}} potential users, exploring two main characteristics of the appropriation process: the duality and the flexibility of technology. The technological structuring model, proposed by Orlikowsky was expanded to verify the relationship between <b>electronic</b> <b>journals</b> and scientific communities. Results reveal <b>electronic</b> <b>journals</b> as both product of and medium for human action. As a product, technology only comes into existence through creative human action. It has no meaning until given meaning through manipulation; as a medium, technology promotes certain types of work and constrains others (duality). When interacting with <b>electronic</b> <b>journals,</b> academics showed to be influenced by the institutional properties of their setting. They based their action on existing stocks of knowledge and resources and norms to perform their work. As such, <b>electronic</b> <b>journals</b> are products of the organisational context, and will reflect the knowledge, materials, interest, and conditions present at a given locus. <b>Electronic</b> <b>journals</b> are flexible {{in the sense that they}} allow more than one interpretation. i. e., their concept vary according to the individual conditions of interaction...|$|R
