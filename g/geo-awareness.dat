30|$|As {{suggested}} by current ICT trends (Future Internet), sensing and actuation resources can {{be involved in}} the Cloud, in our view not exclusively as simple endpoints, but they should be dealt with {{in the same way as}} computing and storage resources usually are in more traditional Cloud stacks: abstracted, virtualized, and grouped in Clouds. Moreover, by adding sensors and actuators into the mix, new opportunities arise for contextualization and <b>geo-awareness.</b> Following the naming conventions for (virtualized) computing resources (“Infrastructure as a Service”—IaaS) and storage resources (“Data as a Service”), we may define such an approach by the phrase “Sensing and Actuation as a Service” (SAaaS). Beyond enabling fixed infrastructure, the resulting scenario is highly dynamic since it may also involve volatile mobile devices. Thus, a workable plan to address such issues suitably is to resort to the volunteer contribution model as an underlying approach.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Pervasive {{environmental}} monitoring implies {{a wide range}} of technical, but also socio-political challenges, and this applies especially to the sensitive context of the city. In this paper, we elucidate issues for bringing out pervasive urban sensor networks and associated concerns relating to fine-grained information provision. We present the Common Scents project, which is based on the Real-time <b>Geo-awareness</b> approach, and show how it can overcome these challenges. As opposed to hitherto sensing networks, which are mostly built up in monolithic and closed systems, the Common Scents approach aims to establish an open, standards based and modular infrastructure. This ensures interoperability, portability and flexibility, which are crucial prerequisites for pervasive urban sensing. The implementation – a real-time data integration and analysis system for air quality assessment – has been realised on top of the CitySense sensor network in the City of Cambridge, MA US together with the city’s Public Health Department responding to concrete needs of the city and its inhabitants...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{comparison}} of experiences with OSS 4 G {{on the one}} hand and CSS 4 G on the other hand in a vocational training programme offered to participants from developing countries showed a better overall participant satisfaction with the former. Since the design of the OSS 4 G-training was more oriented towards self-learning and self-helping than the CSS 4 G-case, it cannot be concluded that the observed difference in satisfaction is related to the inherent generic characteristics of OSS 4 G as compared to those of CSS 4 G. We do believe however that OSS 4 G-technology has reached a level of maturity which enables the-at least- partial substitution of CSS 4 G in <b>geo-awareness</b> raising, general purpose training in GIS and also in basic academic GIS-education. For more advanced education, CSS 4 G keeps the advantage of meeting more closely the direct requirements of the labour market. OSS 4 G may however offer more incentives for students to explore and develop creative solutions beyond the algorithms built-in in CSS 4 G...|$|E
30|$|In {{the current}} {{worldwide}} ICT scenario, a constantly {{growing number of}} ever more powerful devices (smartphones, sensors, household appliances, RFID devices, etc.) join the Internet, significantly impacting the global traffic volume (data sharing, voice, multimedia, etc.) and foreshadowing a world of (more or less) smart devices, or “things” in the Internet of Things (IoT) perspective. Heterogeneous resources can be aggregated and abstracted according to tailored thing-like semantics, thus enabling Things as a Service paradigm, or better a “Cloud of Things”. In the Future Internet initiatives, sensor networks will assume {{even more of a}} crucial role, especially for making smarter cities. Smarter sensors will be the peripheral elements of a complex future ICT world. However, due to differences in the “appliances” being sensed, smart sensors are very heterogeneous in terms of communication technologies, sensing features and elaboration capabilities. This article intends to contribute to the design of a pervasive infrastructure where new generation services interact with the surrounding environment, thus creating new opportunities for contextualization and <b>geo-awareness.</b> The architecture proposal is based on Sensor Web Enablement standard specifications and makes use of the Contiki Operating System for accomplishing the IoT. Smart cities are assumed as the reference scenario.|$|E
40|$|Geo-information (GI) is {{increasingly}} having a bigger impact on socio-economic benefits. Over the last decade, use of GI {{has shifted from}} a specialised GIS niche market to serving as a direct input to planning and decision-making, public policy, environmental management, readiness to deal with emergencies, creation of value added products, citizen mobility and participation, and community platforms. The emergence of Google Earth and Google Maps has created a <b>geo-awareness</b> and has catalysed a thirst for custom-made geo-information. Governments possess, often high-quality large-scale GI, primarily created, collected, developed and maintained to support their public tasks. This rich source of GI begs to be used and reused both within the public sector and by society. Both the INSPIRE Directive (2007 / 02 /EC) and the Directive on reuse on Public Sector Information - the so-called PSI Directive - (2003 / 98 /EC) underwrite the philosophy of “collect once, reuse many times”. Web services are {{an effective way to}} make public sector geo-information available. They allow information to be accessed directly at the source and to be combined from different sources. However, the costs of web services are high and revenues do not always cover the costs. Assuming {{that there is no such}} thing as a free lunch related to public sector GI (Longhorn and Blakemore, 2008), which business models and which financial models form the basis for public sector geo web services? This article explores the different models currently in use and illustrates them with examples. OTB Research Institut...|$|E
30|$|The {{papers in}} this Special Issue are {{organized}} into three thematic groups. The {{first set of}} four papers focuses on frameworks and architectures for realizing various aspects of IoT, ranging from device interoperability issues, to service composition methodologies and user-interaction models for IoT, as well as efficiently combining different underlying technologies for building next generation services. Specifically, in “Mashing Up the Internet of Things: A Framework for Smart Environments” [1], a framework and an user-interaction model for IoT applications are introduced toward addressing the following key questions: how data and functionality provided by services on smart environments can be modeled {{in order to facilitate}} abstraction and composition, and second, how users are intended to interact with the environments in order to make applications support their particular needs. In “P 2 P and Grid Computing: Opportunity for Building Next Generation Wireless Multimedia Digital Library” [2], a framework for wireless multimedia digital library is designed, by adopting peer-to-peer overlay networking technology to address the storage space problem and by using grid computing approach to maintain security. In “A Web-based Two-layered Integration Framework for Smart Devices” [3], a web-based framework is provided that enables smart devices to integrate with each other via light-weight interfaces and other back-end applications into agile business process, while a real-life use case on elderly care is studied in detail based on this framework. Finally, in “Combining Cloud and sensors in a smart city environment” [4], concepts and principles from cloud computing and sensing are efficiently combined and integrated to facilitate the design of a pervasive infrastructure, where new generation services interact with the surrounding environment, thus creating new opportunities for contextualization and <b>geo-awareness.</b>|$|E
