5000|$|Modern {{gasoline}} engines also utilise direct injection, {{which is}} referred to as gasoline direct injection. This is the next step in evolution from multi-point fuel injection, and offers another magnitude of emission control by eliminating the [...] "wet" [...] portion of the induction system along the <b>inlet</b> <b>tract.</b>|$|E
50|$|Most {{internal}} combustion engines now require a fuel pump. Diesel engines use an all-mechanical precision pump system that delivers a timed injection direct into the combustion chamber, hence requiring a high delivery pressure {{to overcome the}} pressure of the combustion chamber. Petrol fuel injection delivers into the <b>inlet</b> <b>tract</b> at atmospheric pressure (or below) and timing is not involved, these pumps are normally driven electrically. Gas turbine and rocket engines use electrical systems.|$|E
50|$|The well-proven Venom was {{improved}} by Velocette designer (and owning-family member) Bertie Goodman with rearward placed footrests having brake pedal and remote gear-change linkage to suit, close-ratio four speed gearbox, alloy rims, twin-leading shoe front brake and 'clip-on' handle bars. The engine gained a race specification cylinder head to accommodate extra-large valves, a downdraught inlet port and an Amal 5GP2 13/8 bore carburettor with extended <b>inlet</b> <b>tract</b> {{which was so}} long it required a special cut out {{in the rear of}} the fuel tank. The upgraded engine delivered , 5 bhp more than the Venom.|$|E
50|$|The engine {{featured}} a standard oil-cooler and a distinctive, unusual exhaust system, {{a first for}} Honda, with cross-over pipes {{directly in front of}} the engine linking cylinders one to four and a separate pair of pipes connecting cylinders two and three. The CV carburettors were of a new type using mixture-enriching internal fuel passages for cold-starts, with careful engineering of the <b>inlet</b> <b>tracts</b> to achieve smooth gasflow.|$|R
5000|$|By its {{introduction}} at the 1954 French GP the [...] (76.0×68.8 mm) desmodromic valves straight 8 delivered [...] The W196 {{was the only}} F1 car with such advanced fuel technology, giving it a considerable advantage over the other carburetted engines. Variable length <b>inlet</b> <b>tracts</b> were experimented with and four wheel drive considered. An eventual [...] at 10,000 rpm was targeted for the 2.5-litre F1 motor.|$|R
50|$|Wankel {{engines are}} {{internal}} combustion engines using an eccentric rotary design to convert pressure into rotating motion. These engines exhibit some features of both four stroke and two stroke engines. Lubrication is total loss, {{but there may}} be some variations. For instance, the MidWest AE series of wankel aero-engines were not only both water-cooled and air-cooled, but also the engine had a lubrication system is a semi-total-loss system. Silkolene 2-stroke oil was directly injected into the <b>inlet</b> <b>tracts</b> and onto the main roller bearings. The oil that entered the combustion chamber lubricated the rotor tips and was then total-loss, but the oil that fed the bearings became a mist within the rotor-cooling air, and around 30% of that oil was recovered and returned to the remote oil tank.|$|R
5000|$|The {{combustion}} chamber design {{is very similar}} to the pre-WW2 Chevrolet [...] "Blue Flame" [...] OHV six-cylinder, with a [...] "dog leg" [...] L-shaped chamber. The exhaust valve is deeply recessed in a pocket containing most of the chamber volume, and the much longer intake valve is nearly flush with the deck surface. This design of <b>inlet</b> <b>tract,</b> with the large valve opening directly into the cylinder from an individual, semi-downdraught port, provides excellent gas flow resulting in the high volumetric efficiencies of these engines (157 and 158 BMEP from the 2.2L and 2.8L fuel injected versions) ...|$|E
5000|$|Lagenda 110cc - (2003-2005) The Lagenda 110cc {{was simply}} the SR Lagenda with {{increased}} engine displacement. However, a few changes {{have been to the}} model, such as a more rigid chassis with slightly longer wheelbase and a more straight <b>inlet</b> <b>tract</b> from the carburetor to the inlet manifold, reducing the [...] "puddling" [...] effect. The moped is sold at RM4,388 for the kick-start version and RM4,688 for the electric version. In motor sports, the Lagenda 110 has gained a very good reputation as a racing machine because the bike had won almost all podium position for every rounds during the Malaysian Cub Prix.|$|E
50|$|Given {{the design}} {{emphasis}} on durability {{and ease of}} manufacture, the C-Series has always been considered an engine that was both large and heavy for its capacity and power output, initially proving to have little benefit, aside from the greater refinement of six-cylinders, over the Austin-designed four-cylinder 2.6-litre BS1 engine installed in the Austin A90 Atlantic and Austin-Healey 100. Austin's engineers attributed this to the poor cylinder head design. In 1957 the Healey was given a twelve-port head with a conventional intake manifold, increasing output by 15 bhp or fifteen percent. In 1959 carburetters were revised and replaced. In 1961 the <b>inlet</b> <b>tract</b> was improved, exhaust timing was adjusted, and twin exhausts added. Later in 1961 the saloon engines were slightly detuned and the Healey version's performance upgraded, probably by Weslake. Then the Austin Healey Mark III was announced.|$|E
5000|$|Very closely {{based on}} the Norton engine, the MidWest engine {{nevertheless}} took things a stage further. The lubrication system became a semi-total-loss system whereby Silkolene 2-stroke oil was directly injected into the <b>inlet</b> <b>tracts</b> and onto the main roller bearings, but the oil that fed the bearings became an oil-mist within the rotor-cooling air, and around 30% of the oil was recovered {{and returned to the}} remote oil tank. Unlike the Nortons, the rotor-cooling air was forced in by a belt-driven centrifugal pump and then dumped overboard as it was considered too hot for ideal volumetric efficiency. Instead, ambient-temperature combustion air was inducted into the engine separately. Early Midwest engines had simple Tillotson carburettors, but these proved unsatisfactory, and later engines were fitted with fuel injection. [...] This gave the advantage both of excellent fuelling, and avoided any need for carb heat.|$|R
2500|$|Despite {{having only}} a single rotor, the RE5's engine was {{mechanically}} complex and its numerous subsystems made for a heavy motorcycle. Rotary engines produce a lot of heat, and the RE5 had [...] water- and oil-cooling, and double-skinned exhaust pipes. [...] Ignition was CDI, with two sets of ignition points actuated via vacuum and rpm sensors, to light a solitary NGK spark plug. Three oil reservoirs served the sump, gearbox and total loss tank. Separate oil pumps fed (respectively) the main bearings and the <b>inlet</b> <b>tracts</b> (to lubricate tip seals). The throttle controlled both the primary carburetor butterfly and a second valve in the inlet manifold of the secondary throat (the [...] "port" [...] valve), as well as governing oil supply to the combustion chamber. Five cables in total were moved by the throttle twist grip! The carburetor {{was similar to that}} in a rotary-powered car, and was far more complicated than for normal motorcycles.|$|R
5000|$|The CX series {{feature a}} {{crankshaft}} configuration aligned longitudinally with {{the axis of}} bike, similar to the Moto Guzzi layout. Unlike a [...] "boxer" [...] flat-twin, the cylinders protrude at an angle above the horizontal. The included angle of the CX is 80°, and the heads are twisted 22° so that the <b>inlet</b> <b>tracts</b> do {{not interfere with the}} rider's legs. A camshaft nestles {{at the base of the}} V between the cylinders. Although Honda generally favors OHC engines, the cylinder head twist necessitated the use of stubby pushrods to operate the four overhead valves per cylinder, with a forked rocker arm acting off each pushrod. The 5-speed transmission is located below the crankshaft, with both in the same housing, an arrangement which keeps the engine short (length wise) but quite tall. The engine has a 10.0:1 compression ratio and 9,650 rpm redline. Just as with the Honda Gold Wing, the transmission spins contrariwise to the engine's rotation to help counteract the engine torque's tendency to tip the bike slightly to one side when the throttle is opened or closed.|$|R
50|$|In a {{naturally}} aspirated engine, air for combustion (diesel cycle in a diesel engine, or {{specific types of}} Otto cycle in gasoline engines - namely gasoline direct injection), or an air/fuel mixture (traditional Otto cycle petrol engines) is drawn into the engines cylinders by atmospheric pressure acting against a partial vacuum that occurs as the piston travels downwards toward bottom dead centre during the intake stroke. Owing to innate restriction in the engine's <b>inlet</b> <b>tract</b> which includes the intake manifold, a small pressure drop occurs as air is drawn in, resulting in a volumetric efficiency of less than 100 percent - and a less than complete air charge in the cylinder. The density of the air charge, and therefore the engine's maximum theoretical power output, {{in addition to being}} influenced by induction system restriction, is also affected by engine speed and atmospheric pressure, the latter which decreases as the operating altitude increases.|$|E
5000|$|The M47TUD20 {{introduced}} new common failure points. Chief {{among these}} {{was a new}} 'swirl flap' mechanism embedded in the inlet manifold. This consisted {{of a number of}} butterfly valves within each individual <b>inlet</b> <b>tract,</b> which are secured to an actuating rod via two small screws. It has become clear that over time these screws can come loose via vibration etc. When this happens they can end up being drawn into the respective cylinder, causing significant damage to piston, cylinder head and valves. If unlucky further damage can be caused to the turbo if the screw then makes its way through the exhaust valve into the manifold and subsequently into the turbo. These failures have occurred in such quantity that a number of specialist BMW magazines have featured articles on the problem including information on how to remove the swirl flaps. [...] For those who wish to perform some preventive maintenance on the M47TUD20 engine, there are companies who supply and/or fit blanking plugs to allow the removal of these swirl flaps altogether. BMW addressed the problem by introducing stronger swirl flaps and larger diameter spindles - made from plastic - in 2006.|$|E
5000|$|Gordon Murray then {{approached}} BMW, {{which took}} an interest, and the motorsport division BMW M headed by engine expert Paul Rosche {{designed and built}} Murray a 6.1 L (6,064 cc) 60-degree V12 engine called the BMW S70/2.At [...] and 266 kg the BMW engine ended up 14% more powerful and 16 kg heavier than Gordon Murray's original specifications, with the same block length.It has an aluminium alloy block and heads, with 86 mm x 87 mm bore/stroke, quad overhead camshafts with variable valve timing (a relatively new and unproven technology for the time) for maximum flexibility {{of control over the}} four valves per cylinder, and a chain drive for the camshafts for maximum reliability.The engine uses a dry sump oil lubrication system.The carbon fibre body panels and monocoque required significant heat insulation in the engine compartment, so Murray's solution was to line the engine bay with a highly efficient heat-reflector: gold foil. Approximately 16 g (0.8 ounce) of gold was used in each car.The road version used a compression ratio of 11:1 to produce [...] at 7400 rpm and torque output of 480 lb·ft (651 N·m) at 5600 rpm. The engine has a redline rev limiter set at 7500 rpm.In contrast to raw engine power, a car's power-to-weight ratio is a better method of quantifying acceleration performance than the peak output of the vehicle's powerplant. The standard F1 achieves 550 hp/ton (403 kW/tonne), or just 3.6 lb/hp.The cam carriers, covers, oil sump, dry sump, and housings for the camshaft control are made of magnesium castings. The intake control features twelve individual butterfly valves and the exhaust system has four Inconel catalysts with individual Lambda-Sondion controls.The camshafts are continuously variable for increased performance, using a system very closely based on BMW's VANOS variable timing system for the BMW M3; it is a hydraulically actuated phasing mechanism which retards the inlet cam relative to the exhaust cam at low revs, which reduces the valve overlap and provides for increased idle stability and increased low-speed torque. At higher rpm the valve overlap is increased by computer control to 42 degrees (compare 25 degrees on the M3) for increased airflow into the cylinders and thus increased performance.To allow the fuel to atomise fully, the engine uses two Lucas injectors per cylinder, with the first injector located close to the inlet valve - operating at low engine rpm - while the second is located higher up the <b>inlet</b> <b>tract</b> - operating at higher rpm. The dynamic transition between the two devices is controlled by the engine computer.Each cylinder has its own miniature ignition coil. The closed-loop fuel injection is sequential. The engine has no knock sensor as the predicted combustion conditions would not cause this to be a problem. The pistons are forged in aluminium.Every cylinder bore has a nikasil coating giving it a high degree of wear resistance.From 1998 to 2000, the Le Mans-winning BMW V12 LMR sports car used a similar S70/2 engine.The engine was given a short development time, causing the BMW design team to use only trusted technology from prior design and implementation experience. The engine does not use titanium valves or connecting rods. Variable intake geometry was considered but rejected on grounds of unnecessary complication.As for fuel consumption, the engine achieves on average 15.2 mpg (15 L/100 km), at worst 9.3 mpg (25 L/100 km) and at best 23.4 mpg (10 L/100 km).|$|E

40|$|For maximum {{operating}} efficiency of Roots type blowers, the leakage of compressed air through clearance must {{be reduced to}} a minimum. At the same time it is desirable to keep the design as compact as possible. The following analysis endeavours to show, for involute rotors, the effect of the geometrical design variables, pressure angle, rotor tip radius, and base circle radius, on leakage and compactness. Firstly limits of permissible values of the geometrical design variables, to allow correct mating between rotors, are established. Within these limits, relative blower compactness and carry-over of compressed air back to the <b>inlet</b> <b>tract</b> is obtained for the ideal blower with no clearance between relative rotating parts. The analysis and results are expressed in dimensionless form independent of blower size, and results are compared with cycloid rotors. Leakage through blower clearances, in terms of the geometrical design variables, is then determined for a range of pressure ratios, and the dependence on blower size is examined. It is concluded that optimum design values cannot be obtained. A compromise solution between minimum total leakage and maximum compactness is necessary, depending on the operating requirements for a particular Roots blower...|$|E
40|$|A {{multipurpose}} computational {{engine crankcase}} model of KUKTEM two-stroke modular diesel engine {{has been developed}} to analyze the crankcase interior flow. The complexity of crankcase flow {{is due to the}} occurrence of reed valve before the crankcase and upstream the crankcase at the auxiliary port of the engine. Furthermore, current computational fluid dynamic solver is unable to handle the multi-physics interaction of reed valve petal with air. The crankcase flow is investigated by profiling the pressure built-up inside the crankcase geometry and examination of flow pattern during transient operation. The methodology is based on solution of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) formulation. The governing equation of CFD and robust k-e model are coupled with moving dynamic mesh model and sliding mesh model to represent the isotropic motion of piston and rotational motion of crankshaft and balancing shaft. The inputs to this model are based on motoring results of the same base engine. The pressure fluctuation inside the <b>inlet</b> <b>tract</b> is used as the pressure inlet boundary while the cylinder pressure upstream of the crankcase is set as the pressure outlet boundary. The modeling results shows that the maximum pressure inside the crankcase can achieve its ideal compression pressure. The compression ratio is about 1. 14 bar based on nominal crankcase compression ratio but the trend of plot having large deviation due to ineffective reed valve model. Better solution of the flow can be achieved if proper reed valve model is available where the pressure at inlet and the outlet boundary can be calculated simultaneously...|$|E
40|$|Atriofascicular {{accessory}} bundles with AV-node like conduction properties {{can sustain}} atrioventricular (AV) re-entrant tachycardia (Mahaim tachycardia). During early embryogenesis, the AV canal is situated above the primitive left ventricle (LV), and a right AV connection {{has not been}} achieved yet. We studied {{the formation of the}} right ventricular (RV) inflow tract in relation to the developing cardiac conduction system and hypothesized a morphological explanation for functional atriofascicular bypass tracts. Analysis of lacZ-expression during sequential stages of cardiogenesis was performed in CCS-lacZ transgenic mice (E 9. 5 to 15. 5). Embryos were stained for beta-galactosidase activity and the myocardial marker HHF 35. At early stages CCS-lacZ expression was observed in a ring surrounding the AV canal, which connected at the inner curvature to the primary fold. The first sign of formation of the (CCS-lacZ negative) RV inlet component was a groove in the CCS-lacZ positive tissue of the primary fold. Outgrowth of the RV <b>inlet</b> <b>tract</b> resulted in division of the primary fold in a septal part, the trabecula septomarginalis and a lateral part, the moderator band, which extended laterally up to the right AV ring. Electrophysiological measurements in embryonic hearts (E 15. 5) in which the right atrium (RA) and RV were isolated from the left atrium (LA) and LV supported the functionality of this AV-connection via the moderator band, by demonstrating sequential atrial and ventricular activation in both RA/RV and LA/LV preparations. In conclusion, our observations may provide a possible morphological and functional explanation for atriofascicular accessory pathways via the moderator band, underlying Mahaim tachycardi...|$|E

ABSTRACT Mitral stenosis is the {{obstruction of}} the left ventricular <b>inlet</b> <b>tract</b> by a generally rheumatic mitral valve pathology. The most frequent symptoms are dyspnea on exertion, which can sometimes progress to acute pulmonary edema, and palpitations. Hemoptysis, systemic embolisms, thoracic pain, and {{signs and symptoms of}} right failure may also be observed. Medical treatment is aimed at reducing symptoms and avoiding the impact of increased left atrial pressure on the pulmonary circulation; while surgical treatment should be considered in those patients with a disabling symptomatology or when the valvular area is {{less than or equal to}} 1. 5 cm 2. This paper presents the case of a 42 -year-old female with a diagnosis of severe mitral stenosis associated with atrial fibrillation. The clinical status, the evolution, the findings of ECG and ECO- 2 D are examined. The pertinent considerations are made to the medical and surgical management, based on the criteria of the patient studied. Key words: Mitral Stenosis, Valvulopathy, Atrial Fibrillation. <br...|$|E
