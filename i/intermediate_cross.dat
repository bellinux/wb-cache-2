DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a method for reducing tensile stress at surfaces in circumferential direction during pulling or spinning of wires. USE - Drawing die for reducing the cross section of a wire.

40|$|Physical process {{version of}} the first law of black hole {{mechanics}} relates the change in entropy of a perturbed Killing horizon, between two asymptotic cross sections, to the matter flow into the horizon.

Moreover, the above result goes beyond general relativity and holds for Lanczos-Lovelock gravity as well. Comment: 15 pages, 1 figur...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of transverse steel configuration on the inelastic behaviour of high-strength reinforced concrete (HSRC) columns {{that were designed}} complying with the shear strength of BS 8110 (BS columns), the authors' proposed equation (NEW columns) and the provisions of Design Guidance for High Strength Concrete (BS' columns) has been studied experimentally. Totally ten (five pairs) HSRC columns having concrete cube strength from 57 to 111 MPa were fabricated and tested under various levels of compressive axial load as well as reversed cyclic inelastic displacement excursions. Each pair of the columns contained almost identical cross-sectional properties, including concrete strength, applied compressive axial load level, content of longitudinal steel and transverse steel, except the configuration of transverse steel. In the BS columns (two pairs) {{as well as the}} NEW columns (two pairs), one of the columns in each pair contained <b>intermediate</b> <b>cross</b> ties along with single closed square hoops, which formed the transverse steel of the other column of the same pair. All end hooks of the transverse steel were bent 90 ° in the BS columns, but 135 ° (forming 45 ° angle) in the NEW columns. In the BS' columns, both of them contained <b>intermediate</b> <b>cross</b> ties in addition to single closed square hoops, but their end hooks were bent 90 ° in one of the columns and 135 ° in the other column. It was evident from the results that: (1) the NEW columns with cross ties had ultimate deformability superior than their counterparts without cross ties, (2) adverse effects in flexural strength and ductility were found in the BS columns containing cross ties with moderate amount of longitudinal steel due to large transverse steel spacing, (3) 45 ° end hooks effectively delayed the inelastic buckling of longitudinal steel, and (4) all the NEW columns behaved in a limited ductile manner. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|We {{study how}} the {{internal}} structure of dark halos is affected if {{cold dark matter}} particles are assumed to have a large cross section for elastic collisions. We identify a cluster halo in a large cosmological N-body simulation and resimulate its formation with progressively increasing resolution. We compare the structure found in the two cases in which dark matter is treated as collisionless or as a fluid. For the collisionless case, the overall ellipticity of the cluster, the central density cusp, {{and the amount of}} surviving substructure are all similar to those found in earlier high-resolution simulations. Collisional dark matter results in a cluster that is more nearly spherical at all radii, has a steeper central density cusp, and has less-but still substantial-surviving substructure. As in the collisionless case, these results for a ``fluid'' cluster halo are expected to carry over approximately to smaller mass systems. The observed rotation curves of dwarf galaxies then argue that self-interacting dark matter can only be viable if <b>intermediate</b> <b>cross</b> sections produce structure that does not lie between the extremes we have simulated...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an extensive numerical parametric study on seismic behavior of 2 D homogenous hills subjected to vertically propagating incident SV waves. It is shown that the amplification potential of these hills is strongly influenced by the wavelength, by the shape ratio, by the shape of the hill and in a less order of importance, by the Poisson ratio of the media. The 2 D topography effect could be ignored, only if the hill has a shape ratio of less than 0. 1 or if it is subjected to incident waves with predominant dimensionless periods of greater than 13 times the shape ratio. In incidence of waves with wavelengths longer than the width of the hill, the amplification curve usually finds its maximum at the crest and decreases towards the base of the hill. Else, some de-amplification zones would occur along the hill. Among hills with similar shape ratios, those with <b>intermediate</b> <b>cross</b> section areas show intermediate seismic behavior, too. Estimated seismic site coefficients for the crest of a 2 D rocky hill depend on its shape ratio and could reach even 1. 7, which encourages one to classify it according to standard site categorization procedures as soil profile types SC or SD instead of the conventional SB type. 1...|$|E

40|$|Steel girders require {{stability}} {{controls for}} different construction stages before the lateral-torsional {{support from the}} concrete deck occurs. The load-carrying capacity of bridge girders and bracing forces generated in their bracings {{are very sensitive to}} the girders' initial imperfections in terms of both the magnitude and distribution along the span. Relatively little knowledge is available in this matter; however, decisions on the "worst" shape of imperfections that gives a conservative resistance and/or maximizes the bracings forces is often not an easy task in practice. The present paper reports the test results (in terms of the load-carrying capacities and bracing forces) of a large-scale bridge of twin I-girder type in which the location of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>cross</b> beam was varied across the depth of the main girders. Moreover, extensive numerical investigations were performed to study the effects of some relevant shape of imperfections on both the load-carrying capacities of the studied bridges and the magnitude of bracing forces generated in the cross beams that were involved. The test results showed that the load-carrying capacity of steel girders can exceed their lowest theoretical eigenvalue {{because of the presence of}} initial imperfections. In the finite-element analyses of the studied bridge cases, in some cases, the girders followed their shape of geometric imperfections and reached a load value that was greater than the lowest eigenvalue of the systems...|$|E
40|$|What is Data Cabling? A {{structured}} cabling {{system is a}} type of network construction that is open and is used by different systems like data, access management, telephony, building automation, along with many other similar capabilities. It is an extremely flexible and economical set up. Usually, a cabling system such as this can be broken into six components: work space, horizontal cabling, backbone cabling, gear space, telecommunication closet (room) and entrance ways. Common Network Set up Work space components are extended over into horizontal cabling networks via the telecommunications connector, reaching into the equipment in the targeted workspace. The components utilized in the work place usually include channel equipment (computers, information terminals, telephones, etc.), patch cables (modular cords, PC adapter wires, fiber patch cables, etc.) and communication sockets or outlets. Horizontal cabling setups are designed to extend to the telecommunications data outlet directly to the desired work area. The elements of horizontal cabling contain cable terminations, telecommunication outlets, cross-connections, cable from the patch panel into the work place, and cross-connects into different telecommunication rooms. Generally speaking, backbone cabling networks contain components such as spine wires (typically optical fiber cables), mechanical terminations, intermediate and main cross-connects, and patch cables that can be utilized for backbone-to-backbone cross-connections. Typically, equipment rooms within a building houses (stores) equipment in a type of network room. This usually includes main corr-connect, horizontal connects, or <b>intermediate</b> <b>cross</b> connects. A telecommunication room house any terminations of backbone and horizontal cables to joining hardware such as patch cords or jumpers. Entrance facilities typically have a telecommunications service entrance to the backbone and construction pathways different buildings. These areas contain the wires, network demarcation points, connecting safety devices, hardware and other equipment that connect to personal network cabling and your access provider.

40|$|Breeding {{programs}} {{aiming at}} transferring desirable genes from one species to another through interspecific hybridization and backcrossings often produce monosomic and disomic additions as <b>intermediate</b> <b>crossing</b> products. Such aneuploids contain alien chromosomes {{added to the}} complements of the recipient parent {{and can be used}} for further introgression programs, but lack of homoeologous recombination and inevitable segregation of the alien chromosome at meiosis make them often less ideal for producing stable introgression lines. Monosomic and disomic additions can have specific morphological characteristics, but more often they need additional confirmation of molecular marker analyses and assessment by fluorescence in situ hybridization with genomic and chromosome-specific DNA as probes. Their specific genetic and cytogenetic properties make them powerful tools for fundamental research elucidating regulation of homoeologous recombination, distribution of chromosome-specific markers and repetitive DNA sequences, and regulation of heterologous gene expression. In this overview we present the major characteristics of such interspecific aneuploids highlighting their advantages and drawbacks for breeding and fundamental researc...|$|R

The onward line to Salisbury lay across thinly populated territory, and the GWR pressed ahead with other priorities at first, but the authorising Act of Parliament (inherited by the GWR) did not merely permit the construction, it required it. Local interests were frustrated {{at the lack of}} progress towards Salisbury, as well as other routes of the original Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth scheme. A writ of mandamus was obtained at the Queen's Bench for the line from Bradford on Avon to Bathampton, and the GWR applied for an extension of time and certain other powers to complete the lines. This was granted, but on the condition that GWR dividends would be stopped if the construction was not swiftly completed. In the face of this the GWR proceeded quickly; there were no great engineering difficulties, and the line from Warminster to Salisbury opened to mineral traffic on 11 June 1856, and to passengers on 30 June 1856.
