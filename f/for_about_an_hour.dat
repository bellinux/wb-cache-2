5|$|A {{particularly}} damning {{piece of}} evidence came from a bonnetmaker named Maria Durden who told the court that Webster had visited her {{a week before the}} murder and had said {{that she was going to}} Birmingham to sell some property, jewellery and a house that her aunt had left her. The jury interpreted this as a sign that Webster had premeditated the murder and convicted her after deliberating <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> and a quarter.|$|E
5|$|Adults of {{most species}} of mole cricket can fly powerfully, if not with agility, but males do so infrequently. The females {{typically}} take wing soon after sunset, and {{are attracted to}} areas where males are calling, which they do <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> after sunset. This may be in order to mate, {{or they may be}} influenced by the suitability of the habitat for egg-laying, as demonstrated by the number of males present and calling in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|Goss darted inside, but Hays {{slipped and}} fell {{before he could}} enter the blockhouse. As he fell, three musket balls lodged {{themselves}} into the wall {{where he had been}} standing moments before. While the attackers reloaded, Hays slipped inside and <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> an exchange of heavy gunfire erupted between the parties before the attackers withdrew. A fourth man, Upton, was out hunting nearby; when he was discovered by the attackers he was chased throughout the afternoon. Upton escaped the attackers injury-free. In fact, no person was killed or injured during the Plum River raid. The small raiding party escaped with three horses, but two horses were badly wounded by gunfire, and the other shot dead by the settlement's defenders.|$|E

50|$|Similar {{to group}} couple counseling, couple-enrichment {{programs}} are conducted by trained professionals and have groups of couples (typically about 10) attend {{and learn how}} to improve and enrich their relationships. Many different teaching formats are used that include tools such as role playing, the viewing of videos, and the implementation of other psycho-social exercises. Sessions run <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour's</b> time.|$|R
5|$|Komet {{returned}} to Nauru following the unsuccessful attempt to mine Rabaul, and arrived {{off the island}} at 05:45 {{on the morning of}} 27December. After issuing a warning for those on shore to not use radio and signalling her intent to destroy the phosphate loading plant, she opened fire at 06:40. The bombardment lasted <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> during which time the raider wrecked the loading plant, oil tanks, boats, buildings and mooring buoys. Following this attack, she sailed to the south-east and Nauru broadcast news of the attack to Australia. This was the last visit of German ships to Nauru during the war, and Komet transferred her activities to the Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Next in the line, to the north, was Quinn's Post, {{defended by}} the 15th Battalion and the 2nd Light Horse Regiment. For {{some time after}} the start of the Turkish attack, the Turks {{opposite}} Quinn's just threw hand grenades at the post. Around 03:30 the Turks' machine-guns and rifles opened fire at the Australians. This lasted <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> when the Turks went over the top and assaulted the post. As elsewhere, they were stopped by the weight of the Australian fire, not only from the trench they were attacking, but also by the defenders at Pope's and from the 2nd New Zealand Artillery Battery. Three more Turkish attacks were also repulsed in a similar fashion.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlers}} took shelter {{inside the}} fort {{while the men}} and boys took up their positions at the portholes inside the fort. A vicious firefight erupted, involving around 150 of Black Hawk's British Band. The battle raged <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> with heavy gunfire from both sides. At the battle's onset many of the settlement's women had been huddled {{in and around the}} cabins, but several married woman, including Elizabeth Armstrong, rallied the women and older children to provide support to the soldiers. She assigned the unmarried young women, boys, and girls as young as eight years old to such tasks as cutting and rolling gunpowder cartridges and molding rifleballs. The married women reloaded the weapons while the soldiers tried to maintain an increased rate of fire.|$|E

5|$|With {{most of its}} {{circulation}} {{over the}} western portion of Florida during its existence, Tropical Storm Marco produced 39–74mph winds across western Florida. As it brushed the coastline, the storm developed strong convective rain bands, leading to peak sustained winds of 69mph (112km/h) with gusts to 85mph (137km/h) on the Sunshine Skyway Bridge; the bridge was closed after gusts reached 70mph (115km/h). Squalls from the storm spawned four tornadoes in the state, one of which struck the city of Crystal River, destroying a mobile home and left 2,000people without power <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> Storm damage left about 25,000customers across the state without power and about 40families temporarily homeless.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the details}} of Hendrix's last day and death are widely disputed, {{he spent much of}} September 17, 1970, in London with Monika Dannemann, the only witness to his final hours. Dannemann said that she {{prepared}} a meal for them at her apartment in the Samarkand Hotel, 22 Lansdowne Crescent, Notting Hill, sometime around 11 p.m., when they shared a bottle of wine. She drove Hendrix to the residence of an acquaintance at approximately 1:45a.m., where he remained <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> before she picked him up and drove them back to her flat at 3 a.m. Dannemann said they talked until around 7 a.m., when they went to sleep. She awoke around 11 a.m., and found Hendrix breathing, but unconscious and unresponsive. She called for an ambulance at 11:18a.m., which arrived on the scene at 11:27a.m. Paramedics then transported Hendrix to St Mary Abbot's Hospital where Dr. John Bannister pronounced him dead at 12:45p.m. on September 18, 1970.|$|E
5|$|In late September, the Italian fleet, {{including}} Fiume, made a sweep for a British troop convoy from Alexandria to Malta, {{but it made}} {{no contact}} with the British ships. Fiume was present in the harbor at Taranto when the British fleet launched the nighttime carrier strike on Taranto {{on the night of}} 1112 November, but she was not attacked in the raid. Another attempt to intercept a British convoy in late November resulted in the Battle of Cape Spartivento. The Italian fleet left port on 26 November and clashed with the British fleet the next day, in an engagement that lasted <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> Campioni broke off the action because he mistakenly believed he was facing a superior force, the result of poor aerial reconnaissance. The British heavy cruiser HMS Berwick was hit twice by 203mm rounds during the engagement, either fired by Fiume or her sister Pola.|$|E

5|$|Information about Wallenberg {{after his}} {{detention}} is mostly speculative; {{there were many}} witnesses who claim to have met him during his imprisonment. Wallenberg was transported by train from Debrecen, through Romania, to Moscow. The Soviet authorities may have moved him to Moscow {{in the hope of}} exchanging him for defectors in Sweden. Vladimir Dekanozov notified the Swedish government on 16 January 1945 that Wallenberg was under the protection of Soviet authorities. On 21 January 1945, Wallenberg was transferred to Lubyanka prison and held in cell 123 with fellow prisoner Gustav Richter, who had been a police attaché at the German embassy in Romania. Richter testified in Sweden in 1955 that Wallenberg was interrogated once <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> and a half, in early February 1945. On 1 March 1945, Richter was moved from his cell and never saw Wallenberg again.|$|E
5|$|With the {{resistance}} seemingly at an end, Morgan began crossing his {{troops in the}} captured steamers. The first company to land moved up the ridge {{on the north shore}} and engaged the Legion defenders in a skirmish. Union commanders in Louisville had sent out requests for naval support in preventing Morgan's crossing when they first received reports from Brandenburg. The tinclad Springfield, armed with six 24-pound howitzers, was at New Albany and was dispatched down-river and arrived on the scene just after Morgan had begun to ferry his force across the river. The Springfield opened fire on Morgan's two steamers who retreated back under the covering fire of the Confederate artillery. The ship began shelling both the north and south shores of the river, firing at least fifty shells into Brandenburg, damaging several buildings and killing three horses. Morgan's forces took cover in nearby forests while the armed steamer and the artillery on the shore dueled <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> Once the Springfield ran out of ammunition she withdrew, allowing Morgan to resume the crossing.|$|E
5|$|Live BBC {{television}} coverage at 08:15 {{the following morning}} showed that although the whole train had been derailed, the rear carriages were standing nearly vertically on the sleepers and ballast. Standard class, the front five carriages, were the worst affected, and the rear four first class carriages were in better condition. The leading carriage, a driving motor coach, had headed down the embankment, and turned end-for-end as it fell. It was lying on its side {{at the foot of}} the embankment. The second carriage had jack-knifed against the first, breaking the coupling, and so had not followed it down the bank. This second carriage came to rest some distance further along the track, at a steep angle with one end in the air. The middle part of the train toppled sideways down the embankment. All the partially friction stir welded carriages remained structurally intact, with damage mainly confined to the crumple zones at their ends. None of the windows broke, and lighting remained in all the carriages. Most injuries occurred in the front two carriages. The driver, who had stayed at the controls (but had little option to move once the accident had started and had no prior indication of derailment), was trapped <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> while specialist cutting equipment was used to free him from his cab. The other three members of the crew were in the rear first class section of the train.|$|E

5|$|The {{only known}} {{predator}} of the fin whale is the killer whale, {{with at least}} 20 eyewitness and second-hand accounts of attack or harassment. They usually flee and offer little resistance to attack. Only a few confirmed fatalities have occurred. In October 2005, 16 killer whales attacked and killed a fin whale in the Canal de Ballenas, Gulf of California, after chasing it <b>for</b> <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> They fed on its sinking carcass for about 15 minutes before leaving the area. In June 2012, a pod of killer whales was seen in La Paz Bay, in the Gulf of California, chasing a fin whale {{for over an hour}} before finally killing it and feeding on its carcass. The whale bore numerous tooth rakes over its back and dorsal fin; several killer whales flanked it on either side, with one individual visible under water biting at its right lower jaw. In July 1908, a whaler reportedly saw two killer whales attack and kill a fin whale off western Greenland. In January 1984, seven were seen from the air circling, holding the flippers, and ramming a fin whale in the Gulf of California, but the observation ended at nightfall.|$|E
