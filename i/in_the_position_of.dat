5|$|In 31, Sejanus {{held the}} consulship with Tiberius , and began his play for power in earnest.

5|$|Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark {{retreated from}} Wollstonecraft's earlier focus on God as judge to God as mere creator, {{shocking}} some conservative readers {{who were not}} prepared to accept anything akin to deism. Worried more about Wollstonecraft's promotion of sensibility, fellow feminist and author Mary Hays criticized the book's mawkishness. A professor of moral philosophy, Thomas Brown, published a poetic response to the book, The Wanderer in Norway (1816). Rather than rejoicing in the freedom that Wollstonecraft argued the connection between nature and emotion offered, however, Brown represented {{her work as a}} failure and Wollstonecraft as a tragic victim. He read the book as a cautionary tale, whereas Wollstonecraft had intended it as a description of the possibilities of social and personal reform. As Favret argues, almost all of the responses to Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark placed the narrator/Mary <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> a sentimental heroine, while the text itself, with its fusion of sensibility and politics, actually does much to challenge that image.|$|E

5|$|Lodge later {{claimed the}} South Vietnamese {{prosecutors}} {{failed to make}} any case against Cẩn. The Vietnamese leader also {{had to contend with}} {{the other side of the}} arguments, from those who considered themselves to be victims of the Diệm regime. During the trial, Thích Trí Quang, along with other opponents of the old regime, lobbied for a death sentence for Cẩn. He argued that if Cẩn lived, he could regain power along with his late brothers' supporters. He told Lodge that if the Americans did not support a tough sentence, then the Vietnamese Buddhist community's opinion of Washington would fall. Lodge was initially critical of Quang's campaigning against Cẩn. Cẩn was sentenced to death. He appealed to the head of state for clemency; his lawyers used a provision in the legal code to make the appeal. This placed Minh — who was still the titular head of state — <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> approving a third death in the Ngô family, having already ordered his bodyguard Nguyễn Văn Nhung to execute Diệm and Nhu during the coup.|$|E

5|$|Proxy records {{based on}} paleotempestological {{research}} {{have revealed that}} major hurricane activity along the Gulf of Mexico coast varies on timescales of centuries to millennia. Few major hurricanes struck the Gulf coast during 3000–1400 BC and again during the most recent millennium. These quiescent intervals were separated by a hyperactive period during 1400 BC and 1000 AD, when the Gulf coast was struck frequently by catastrophic hurricanes and their landfall probabilities increased by 3–5 times. This millennial-scale variability {{has been attributed to}} long-term shifts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> the Azores High, which may also be linked to changes in the strength of the North Atlantic Oscillation.|$|E

5|$|Sejanus again {{attempted}} to marry into the Julio-Claudian family. Having divorced Apicata two years earlier, he requested marriage with Drusus's widow Livilla in AD 25, possibly {{with an eye}} towards placing himself, as an adopted Julian, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> a potential successor. The emperor denied this request, warning Sejanus {{that he was in}} danger of overstepping his rank. Alarmed by this sudden denigration, Sejanus changed his plans and began to isolate Tiberius from Rome. By fueling his paranoia towards Agrippina and the Senate, he induced the emperor to withdraw to the countryside of Campania, which he did in AD 26, and finally to the island of Capri, where he lived until his death in AD 37. Guarded by the Praetorians, Sejanus easily controlled all information that passed between Tiberius and the capital.|$|E
5|$|The {{figures of}} both Venus and Cupid were {{significantly}} altered during the painting process, {{the result of}} the artist's corrections to the contours as initially painted. Pentimenti can be seen in Venus's upraised arm, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>of</b> her left shoulder, and on her head. Infra-red reveals that she was originally shown more upright with her head turned to the left. An area on the left of the painting, extending from Venus's left foot to the left leg and foot of Cupid, is apparently unfinished, but this feature is seen in many other works by Velázquez and was probably deliberate. The painting was given a major cleaning and restoration in 1965–66, which showed it to be in good condition, and with very little paint added later by other artists, contrary to what some earlier writers had asserted.|$|E
