40|$|We {{studied the}} acute antiproteinuric and renal hemodynamic effect of {{dipyridamole}} 30 – 60 mg intravenously in 13 salt-depleted {{patients with the}} nephrotic syndrome of different etiology.

The <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> filtration fraction was positively correlated with the <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> proteinuria.

5|$|Globally, {{there were}} 87 million {{unwanted}} pregnancies in 2005, of those 46 million resorted to abortion, of which 18 million were considered unsafe, resulting in 68,000 deaths.
