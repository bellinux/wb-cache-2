5000|$|He {{has worked}} with many pianists of note, a long-standing {{collaboration}} with Imogen Cooper being widely admired for its exceptionally close rapport; other partners include Andreas Haefliger and Philippe Cassard as well as dedicated accompanyists Gerard Wyss, Russell Ryan and Roger Vignoles. He also maintains a strong presence {{in the world of}} chamber music, where the Trio Wanderer, the Nash Ensemble and the Rachmaninov Trio are among his collaborators. Holzmair regularly appears in major centres in Europe and North America, and also travels to outlying venues where communities have fewer opportunities to hear live recitals. Recent European Music Festivals include Risør, Kuhmo, Lockenhaus, Kyburgiade, the Oxford Lieder Festival and Styriarte, and he has also participated in La Folle Journée's program for bringing classical music to new audiences. In 2010 Holzmair and the <b>Departure</b> <b>Centre</b> for Creative Design in Vienna collaborated in a bid to attract new listeners to lieder, by presenting concerts in which the baritone and 6 compatriots performed Wolf against visual backdrops. The experiment was deemed a success, and was repeated for Mahler’s lieder, with a slightly different cast of singers, in 2011. [...] The Wolf series is now available on 5 DVDs, which show the visuals but not the singers. [...] Holzmair's wide-ranging repertoire includes melodies as well as lieder and extends from the 18th to the 21st century. He has long been committed to bringing to attention the [...] "Entartete" [...] composers who suffered under the Nazi regime and has recorded lieder by Hanns Eisler, Franz Mittler, Erich Zeisl, Ernst Krenek, Franz Schreker and composers from Theresienstadt; in 2010 he joined the Nash Ensemble in a week-end show-casing music by the Theresienstadt composers, at the Wigmore Hall.|$|E

50|$|After the <b>departure</b> {{of regular}} <b>centre</b> half Ray Daniel to Sunderland that summer, Dodgin became first choice {{at the back}} for Arsenal, missing only three matches that season. However, despite his height Dodgin was a rather {{cumbersome}} defender, and could {{not live up to}} the performances of his predecessor. He was dropped at the start of 1954-55 in favour of Jim Fotheringham. He returned in 1956-57 and was a regular in the side for the next four seasons. All through this time, Arsenal were going through a barren patch, and apart from a third-place finish in 1958-59, they were never close to winning a trophy. In total he played 208 matches for Arsenal, scoring one goal.|$|R
5000|$|In 2008, Begum {{worked as}} {{producer}} {{on a new}} interpretation of Federico García Lorca's Blood Wedding which was performed at <b>Departure</b> Arts <b>Centre.</b> In 2013, she worked on live multimedia visuals, costume and stage design for the theatre production The Griot's Tale which was performed at Yinka Shonibare's studio followed by a two-week run at the Africa Centre, London in 2013 and {{was part of the}} first Africa Centre Summer Festival Covent Garden Piazza in London. The Griot's Tale is an inter-disciplinary collaboration featuring actor and storyteller Patrice Naiambana and was written and directed by composer and musician Tunde Jegede. In 2014 Begum worked closely with Tunde Jegede on a new conception entitled, Emidy: He Who Dared To Dream, the life and story of an African Slave who became a composer and virtuoso violinist in C19 England. The piece was initially developed through a month long artist residency at Yinka Shonibare's studio and further developed at Abbaye Royale de Fontevraud in France in 2016. Emidy: He Who Dared To Dream, then went on to tour France and UK in 2017 at the following venues, La Cave Poésie, Tara Theatre, Lyric Theatre and Theatre Utopia.|$|R
50|$|The Hugo Valentin Centre {{is named}} after the Swedish {{historian}} and is an inter-disciplinary forum at Uppsala University with research as its prime task. Research is carried out within two prioritized areas: {{on the one hand}} cultural and social phenomena and processes of change related to the ethnic dimension in human life, on the other hand the Holocaust and other cases of genocide and severe crimes against human rights. To these subject fields belong minority studies and Holocaust and genocide studies as well as related and adjacent subjects where the Centre has a marked specialisation: Holocaust history, massive violence, discrimination, multilingualism, migration and integration. Conditions in the Nordic countries and in the Balkans have a special position, and culture, language, history and religion are natural points of <b>departure</b> for the <b>Centre's</b> work.|$|R
50|$|On 12 May Anson and {{his staff}} were, at Simla when {{the news of the}} actual {{outbreak}} of the mutiny at Meerut and Delhi reached him. He immediately ordered that European troops take possession of the various arsenals in the Punjab but delayed his own <b>departure</b> for the <b>centre</b> of rebellion while logistical problems were resolve. Anson finally left Ambala for Delhi on 23 May at the head of three regiments of British troops and some sepoy units that he considered reliable. His intention was to join with the Meerut Brigade and press on to retake Delhi. However Anson died of cholera four days into the march, at the age of 59. He was buried in Kurnaul (now Karnal). The body was later exhumed and taken back to England to be buried in Kensal Green cemetery.|$|R
50|$|On 2 February 2015, O'Connell {{signed for}} Championship club Brentford on a three-and-a-half year contract. After a spell away on loan, {{he was an}} unused {{substitute}} on four occasions {{before the end of}} 2014-15. O'Connell made his long-awaited debut with a start at left-back in Brentford's second match of 2015-16, a 4-0 League Cup first round defeat to Oxford United. A suspension to Harlee Dean in late November saw O'Connell come into the team and his headed his first Brentford goal to level the score at 2-2 in a West London derby with Fulham on 12 December.

40|$|Much of {{prevailing}} {{research on}} street children pertains to their experiences at home {{prior to their}} abode on the streets, {{as well as their}} ordeal on the streets once they have departed from their homes. Only a few studies highlight their experiences in rehabilitation centres. Hence no study was undertaken to explore factors that contribute to their <b>departure</b> from rehabilitation <b>centres</b> and return to the streets. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine why do some of the street children who were formerly placed in the rehabilitation centres return to the streets. Thus the objectives of the study were to (a) determine the norms and values that are applicable in the centres and (b) determine whether their tendency of returning to the streets results from their negative perception of certain factors in the centres, as well as their desire to resume the life that they adopted on the street prior to their placement in the centres. The sample comprised of sixteen street children who have previously resided in the centres. Focus group interviews were adopted as data collection techniques, and the children were subjected to four focus group interviews. A semi-structured interview was also conducted to one of the caregivers in the centre. A Grounded Theory Approach, which is an integration of the methods proposed by Strauss and Corbin (1990), Glaser (1992), Creswell (1998) and Strauss and Corbin (1998), was utilised for the analysis of the interviews. The findings evinced that the children's <b>departure</b> from the <b>centres</b> and return to the streets culminated from their familiarity with street life, desire to return home, discontentment with some of the living conditions in the centres, ill-treatment by the police and older boys, as well as their desire to resume street life, that is, to partake in income-generation activities and to be reunited with other children who reside on the streets. Much of their interaction with the caregivers also contributed to their retreat from the centres. The caregivers subjected them to discrimination, ill-treatment, false accusations, humiliation, restriction and threatened to transfer them to another centre. In addition to the above- mentioned factors, there were unanticipated findings that also emerged during the study. The findings were clustered as follows: factors that influenced the children to leave the centre and return home, factors that influenced the children to leave their homes and reside on the streets, factors that influenced the children to leave the streets and reside in the centre and factors that influenced the children to leave their homes and return to the streets. Therefore, the children's negative perception of the conditions that they were subjected to in the centres contributed to their return to the streets, as they related well with other street children and were able to earn an income on the streets.

50|$|In the 2010-11 season, Hutchinson made a {{recovery}} from the hamstring injury and made appearances as an unused substitute in the matches, though he remained injured. Hutchinson was due {{to go on a}} one-month loan to Second Division team Ayr United in December 2010, to get match-sharpness. However, the bad weather and match postponements led to Motherwell being forced to call off the switch. Hutchinson forced his way back into the first team {{in the second half of}} the 2010-11 season, mainly due to the <b>departure</b> of first-choice <b>centre</b> back Mark Reynolds to Sheffield Wednesday. Hutchinson made his first appearance of the season when Mothewell and Inverness CT drew 0-0 on 16 January 2011. Hutchinson then scored his first goal of the season on 2 April 2011, in a 2-1 win over Aberdeen. After scoring his first goal of the season, Hutchinson said the goal against Aberdeen put a last laugh on Craig Brown after being overlooked by him the previous season and the start of the season. He helped Motherwell to the final of the 2011 Scottish Cup but they lost the match 3-0 against Celtic. Hutchinson revealed that he never expected to play in the final and couldn't stop smiling. On 2 June 2011, Hutchinson signed a two-year extension to his contract, tying him to Motherwell until 2014. Hutchinson was later grateful to Brown's successor Stuart McCall for giving a first team opportunity and fill in the boots of Reynolds.|$|R
