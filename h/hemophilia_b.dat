DNA testing on the remains of the royal family proved conclusively in 2009 that Alexei suffered from <b>Hemophilia</b> <b>B,</b> a rarer form of the disease. His mother and one sister, identified alternatively as Maria or Anastasia, were carriers. Therefore, had Anastasia lived to have children of her own, they may have been afflicted by the disease as well.

5|$|Maria, {{like her}} mother, was likely a carrier of the {{hemophilia}} gene {{and might have}} passed on the disease to another generation if she had survived to have the children she dreamed of. One of Alexandra's brothers and two of her nephews, {{as well as one}} of her maternal uncles and two children of one of her first cousins were all hemophiliacs, as was Maria's brother Alexei. Maria herself reportedly hemorrhaged in December 1914 during an operation to remove her tonsils, according to her paternal aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia, who was interviewed later in her life. The doctor performing the operation was so unnerved that he had to be ordered to continue by Maria's mother, Tsarina Alexandra. Olga Alexandrovna said she believed all four of her nieces bled more than was normal and believed they were carriers of the hemophilia gene like their mother. Symptomatic carriers of the gene, while not hemophiliacs themselves, can have symptoms of hemophilia including a lower than normal blood clotting factor that can lead to heavy bleeding during childbirth or surgical procedures such as a tonsillectomy. DNA testing on the remains of the royal family proved in 2009 that Alexei suffered from <b>hemophilia</b> <b>B,</b> a rarer form of the disease. The same testing proved that his mother and one of the four Grand Duchesses were carriers. Russians identify the grand duchess who carried the gene as Anastasia, but American scientists identified the young woman as Maria.|$|E

50|$|Impaired {{coordination}} of calcium {{can result in}} serious disorders. Defective calcium binding to coagulation factor IX contributes {{to the development of}} <b>hemophilia</b> <b>B.</b> Individuals afflicted with this hereditary disease tend to develop hemorrhages, potentially leading to life-threatening conditions. The cause of <b>hemophilia</b> <b>B</b> is decreased activity or deficiency of blood coagulation factor IX. Point mutations resulting in decreased affinity of factor IX to calcium are thought to be implicated in this bleeding disorder. On a molecular basis, it appears that <b>hemophilia</b> <b>B</b> can be the result of an impaired ability to localize the Gla module efficiently, as it usually occurs after calcium coordination by the cbEGF module in fully functional factor IX. This defect is thought to impair the biological function of factor IX. A similar problem occurs in patients suffering from <b>hemophilia</b> <b>B</b> and carrying a mutation (Glu78Lys) in factor IX that prevents interaction of the two cbEGF modules with one another. Conversely, in healthy individuals, Glu78 in the first cbEGF-module contacts Arg94 in the second cbEGF module and thereby aligns both modules. Thus, domain-domain interactions (partially facilitated by calcium coordination) are crucial for the catalytic activity of proteins involved in the blood-clotting cascade.|$|E
40|$|<b>Hemophilia</b> A and <b>B</b> are X-linked {{monogenic}} disorders {{caused by}} deficiencies in coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) and factor IX (FIX), respectively. Current {{treatment for hemophilia}} involves intravenous infusion of clotting factor concentrates. However, this does not constitute a cure, {{and the development of}} gene-based therapies for hemophilia to achieve prolonged high level expression of clotting factors to correct the bleeding diathesis are warranted. Different types of viral and nonviral gene delivery systems and a wide range of different target cells, including hepatocytes, skeletal muscle cells, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and endothelial cells, have been explored for hemophilia gene therapy. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) -based and lentiviral vectors are among the most promising vectors for hemophilia gene therapy. Stable correction of the bleeding phenotypes in <b>hemophilia</b> A and <b>B</b> was achieved in murine and canine models, and these promising preclinical studies prompted clinical trials in patients suffering from severe hemophilia. These studies recently resulted in the first demonstration that long-term expression of therapeutic FIX levels could be achieved in patients undergoing gene therapy. Despite this progress, there are still a number of hurdles that need to be overcome. In particular, the FIX levels obtained were insufficient to prevent bleeding induced by trauma or injury. Moreover, the gene-modified cells in these patients can become potential targets for immune destruction by effector T cells, specific for the AAV vector antigens. Consequently, more efficacious approaches are needed to achieve full hemostatic correction and to ultimately establish a cure for <b>hemophilia</b> A and <b>B.</b> © 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

40|$|To gain greater {{insight into}} the nature of the {{bleeding}} tendency in hemophilia, we compared the spatial dynamics of clotting in platelet-free plasma from healthy donors and from patients with severe <b>hemophilia</b> A or <b>B</b> (factor VIII:C or IX:C < 1 %). Clotting was initiated via the intrinsic or extrinsic pathway in a thin layer of nonstirred plasma by bringing it in contact with the glass or fibroblast monolayer surface. The results suggest that clot growth is a process consisting of two distinct phases, initiation and elongation. The clotting events on the activator surface and the preceding period free of visible signs of clotting are the initiation phase. In experiments with and without stirring alike, this phase is prolonged in hemophilic plasma activated by the intrinsic, but not the extrinsic pathway. Strikingly, both <b>hemophilia</b> A and <b>B</b> are associated with a significant deterioration in the elongation phase (clot thickening), irrespective of the activation pathway. The rate of clot growth in hemophilic plasma is significantly lower than normal and declines quickly. The resulting clots are thin, which may account for the bleeding disorder...|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} of factor XI deficiency is not straightforward for three reasons: firstly, {{the role of}} this factor in the coagulation pathway is not clearly understood; secondly, the bleeding tendency, although mild, is unpredictable and does not clearly relate to the factor XI level; and thirdly, all treatment products, although available, have some potentially serious side effects. These factors (or enigmas) contribute to the variable {{management of}} patients with this coagulation factor deficiency, but recent research is helping to clarify some of these areas. Factor XI (FXI) deficiency was described in threemembers a Jewish family in the USA and was calledhemophilia C to distinguish it from <b>hemophilias</b> A and <b>B.</b> 1 FXI deficiency was distinguished from classical hemophilia by its presence in both men and women, a mild bleeding tendency, and the observation that the laboratory defect could be corrected by mixing tests with <b>hemophilia</b> A and <b>B</b> plasmas.

40|$|<b>Hemophilia</b> A and <b>B</b> are X-chromosome linked {{recessive}} bleeding disorders {{that result}} from a deficiency in factor VIII (FVIII) and factor IX (FIX) respectively. Though factor substitution therapy has greatly improved the lives of hemophiliac patients, there are still limitations to the current treatment that have triggered interest in alternative treatments by gene therapy. Significant progress has recently {{been made in the}} development of gene therapy for the treatment of <b>hemophilia</b> A and <b>B.</b> These advances parallel the technical improvements of existing vector systems including MoMLV-based retroviral, adenoviral and AAV vectors, and the development of new delivery methods such as lentiviral vectors, helper-dependent adenoviral vectors and improved non-viral gene delivery methods. Therapeutic and physiologic levels of FVIII and FIX could be achieved in FVIII- and FIX-deficient mice and hemophilia dogs by different gene therapy approaches. Long-term correction of the bleeding disorders and in some cases a permanent cure has been realized in these preclinical studies. However, the induction of neutralizing antibodies often precludes stable phenotypic correction. Another complication is that certain promoters are prone to transcriptional inactivation in vivo, precluding long-term FVIII or FIX expression. Several gene therapy phase I clinical trials are currently ongoing in patients suffering from severe <b>hemophilia</b> A or <b>B.</b> No significant adverse side-effects were reported, and semen samples were negative for vector sequences by sensitive PCR assays. Most importantly, some subjects report fewer bleeding episodes and occasionally have very low levels of clotting factor activity detected.

Preclinical studies in various animal models have demonstrated markedly improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, as well as prolonged retention in the joint tissues, of rVIIa-FP compared with a commercially available rFVIIa (NovoSeven®). A phase I study in healthy volunteers – the first study in the PROLONG- 7 FP program – confirmed that rVIIa-FP has a good tolerability profile in doses of up to 1, 000 μg/kg and has demonstrated enhanced pharmacodynamic activity relative to rFVIIa.

Several preclinical and clinical studies have explored the use of onco-retroviral and, more recently, lentiviral vectors for gene therapy of <b>hemophilia</b> A or <b>B.</b> Both ex vivo and in vivo gene therapy approaches have been evaluated, resulting in therapeutic FVIII or FIX levels in preclinical animal models. Whereas in vivo gene therapy using onco-retroviral or lentiviral vectors often led to long-term FVIII or FIX expression from transduced hepatocytes, ex vivo approaches were generally hampered by either low or transient expression of FVIII or FIX levels in vivo and/or inefficient engraftment. Furthermore, immune responses against the transgene product remain a major issue that must be resolved before the full potential of these vectors eventually can be exploited clinically.

40|$|Background Bone marrow {{transplantation}} (BMT) is nowadays used {{in various}} hematological disorders including leukemias. <b>Hemophilia</b> A & <b>B</b> are sex linked bleeding disorders {{in which there}} are various genetic abnormalities in factor VIII & IX genes. Among various hematological disorders, bleeding disorders mainly hemophilia in now widely treated using plasma derived and recombinant factor VIII & IX concentrates. Day to day transfusion of coagulation factor VIII & IX in current lifelong disorder is a burden for the patients and decrease their quality of life. Although infection of coagulation products with blood-borne viruses that was major concern in treatment of hemophilia has been eliminated nearly complete at the present time, but appearance of factor VIII & IX inhibitors are huge burdens in treatment of hemophilia for both clinicians and patients. In this day and age BMT has gathered new insight and acceptable treatment for many hematological and non-hematological disorders. If BMT will be successful in treatment of hemophilia, it will improve quality of life (by nearly permanent treatment without necessary of daily treatment) and decrease mortality rate (by providing continuous coagulation factor level in blood system). The aim of current study was to determine current role of BMT in treatment of <b>hemophilia</b> A & <b>B</b> and evaluate current usage of BMT for treatment of <b>hemophilia</b> A & <b>B.</b> Methods literature review was done using following key words: “bone marrow transplantation & hemophilia”, “stem cells transplantation & hemophilia”, BMT & hemophilia” in PubMed search engine without any time restriction. In addition the literature search limited to English languages papers. Results After complete search, abstracts of 24 original papers obtained and among them full text of 18 full text of papers accessed. The review of current papers showed that although BMT has been used in a rare cases with hemophilia (mainly hemophilia with another blood disorder), it does not use commonly and currently in treatment of patients with hemophilia A at present time. Literature review showed that scientists now focused on bone marrow transplantation in mouse model of hemophilia.  Conclusion  The literature review showed that BMT at present time is not common medical procedure and it is now in animal models, stage.   Key Words: Bone marrow transplantation, Hemophilia, Treatment. ...|$|R
