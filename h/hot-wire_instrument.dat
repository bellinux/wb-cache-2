40|$|The {{enhancement}} of the thermal conductivity {{of water in}} the presence of carbon-multiwall nanotubes (C-MWNT) was investigated. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was employed as the dispersant, and a 0. 6 vol% suspension of C-MWNT in water was used in all measurements. The thermal conductivity was measured with a transient <b>hot-wire</b> <b>instrument</b> built for this purpose, and operated with a standard uncertainty better than 2 The maximum thermal conductivity enhancement obtained was 38 %. In an attempt to explain the experimental observations, a number of micro-structural investigations have been carried out and those results are presented here along with the analysis...|$|E
40|$|The paper reports an {{assessment}} of the repeatability of a method for the measurement of the thermal conductivity of high temperature melts. The main goal is to demonstrate that a novel approach to the transient hotwire technique can yield highly accurate results that are consistent with previous, independent measurements. The paper summarizes the modified transient hot-wire method, presents improvements in the finite-element analysis of its operation, and briefly discusses deviations from available analytical equations. The transient <b>hot-wire</b> <b>instrument</b> and experimental configuration are also described. Results from measurements on molten metals, in particular, tin and indium, in the temperature range from their melting points up to 750 K are presented. A comparison with previously measured values is given, and the accuracy and repeatability of the method are discussed...|$|E
40|$|New {{measurements}} of the thermal conductivity of molten mercury, gallium, tin, and indium are reported up to 750 K. The measurements are performed in a novel transient <b>hot-wire</b> <b>instrument</b> described elsewhere. The present experimental technique overcomes problems of convection, and it is shown that it operates in an absolute way in accord with a theoretical model. The uncertainty of the thermal conductivity results {{is estimated to be}} +/- 2 %, which is superior to that achieved in most earlier work. The low uncertainty of the present experimental results has allowed us to test the only significant theory for the thermal conductivity of molten metals, which relates this property to the electrical conductivity The pattern of results among the four metals indicates that further theoretical developments would be warranted...|$|E
40|$|The {{transient}} short-hot-wire {{method for}} measuring thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity {{makes use of}} only one thermal-conductivity cell, and end effects {{are taken into account}} by numerical simulation. A search algorithm based on the Gauss-Newton nonlinear least-squares method is proposed to make the method applicable to high-diffusivity (i. e., low-density) gases. The procedure is tested using computer-generated data for hydrogen at atmospheric pressure and published experimental data for low-density argon gas. Convergence is excellent even for cases where the temperature rise versus the logarithm of time is far from linear. The determined values for thermal conductivity from experimental data are in good agreement with published values for argon, while the thermal diffusivity is about 10 % lower than the reference data. For the computer-generated data, the search algorithm can return both thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity to within 0. 02 % of the exact values. A one-dimensional version of the method may be used for analysis of low-density gas data produced by conventional transient <b>hot-wire</b> <b>instruments.</b> No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Measurements {{were made}} of the heat loss and {{recovery}} temperature of a fine hot-wire at a nominal Mach number of 5. 8. Data were obtained over an eight-fold range of Reynolds numbers in the transitional regime between continuum and free-molecule flow. At high Reynolds numbers, the heat transfer data agree well {{with the results of}} Laufer and McClellan, which were obtained at lower Mach numbers. At lower Reynolds numbers, the results indicate a monotonic transition between continuum and free molecule heat transfer laws. The slope of the heat transfer correlation also appears to vary monotonically, with Nu=√Re at high Reynolds numbers and Nu Re for Re < < 1. Data on the wire recovery temperature (corresponding to zero net heat transfer) were obtained for free-stream Knudsen numbers between 0. 4 and 3. 0. Comparison with previous data suggests that for Mach numbers greater than about two the normalized variation of recovery temperature in the transitional regime is a unique function of the free-stream Knudsen number. The steady-state hot-wire may be used to obtain two thermodynamic measurements: the rate of heat transfer from the wire and the wire recovery temperature. An illustrative experiment was performed {{in the wake of a}} transverse cylinder, using both <b>hot-wire</b> and pressure <b>instruments</b> in a redundant system of measurements. It was shown that good accuracy may be obtained with a hot-wire even when the Reynolds number based on wire diameter is small...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} the most suitable, practical and representative sampling sites to undertake reliable air quality and environmental assessments in intensive piggery buildings, the spatial, diurnal and seasonal variations observed in the concentrations of major airborne pollutants (including ammonia, carbon dioxide, and airborne particles) and related environmental parameters (such as airspeed, temperature and humidity) were investigated. Air quality parameters were recorded {{in a number of}} piggery buildings over a 2. 5 -day period. The air quality monitoring equipment used included cyclone attachments to measure particles of less than 5 microns and an SHS (Seven Hole Samplers) attachment to measure inhalable airborne particles, attached to air pumps operated at 1. 9 and 2. 0 L/min respectively. Ammonia and carbon dioxide were monitored using a Multi-gas Gas Monitoring Machine (MGM) for a number of days on each monitoring occasion. The concentrations of airborne particles were also measured using Osiris optical particle counter (Turnkey technologies, UK) and airspeed were measured using a <b>hot-wired</b> anemometer (Alnor <b>Instruments,</b> Shoreview, Minn.). Interesting patterns in the concentration of carbon dioxide, dust and ammonia were observed over time and space. Carbon dioxide, airspeed and dust concentration demonstrated an obvious circadian pattern. The difference in the concentrations ammonia and carbon dioxide between different sampling sites in the same building was not statistically significant. However, the concentration of inhalable particles was not uniform throughout the buildings and proved to be higher above the walkways when using gravimetric measurements. Ammonia and respirable particle concentrations were significantly higher in summer when compared to winter conditions. The results combined give us a clear picture of the most appropriate sampling times and sampling places for appropriate evaluation of air quality in intensive livestock buildings...|$|R

The measurements have been carried out with a transient <b>hot-wire</b> <b>instrument</b> originally designed for the measurement of the thermal conductivity of pure molten metals. In the application reported here the instrument has been used largely unchanged but an improved finite-element code has been used for the analysis of the raw data so as to yield the thermal conductivity of the molten solders. The measurements extend from the melting point of the solder up to 625 K. The uncertainty in the thermal conductivity measurements is estimated to be no larger than 3 %...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} {{contribution}} systematic effective thermal conductivity measurements with different methods are reported for various materials. Some {{of these are}} isotropic (calcium silicate) some of them not (alumino-silicate and alumina fibre mats). The measurements were done with two different steady-state panel test facilities (according to ASTM C 201, self designed and constructed), two guarded hot plate facilities (ISO 8302, with one and with two samples respectively), one steady-state radial heat flow facility (self designed) and one transient <b>hot-wire</b> <b>instrument</b> (DIN EN 993 - 14). These facilities are operated at ambient pressure and atmosphere (air) between 20 °C and 1650 °C, and they are briefly described in the paper. The results show the well known increase of conductivity with the temperature mainly due to radiation heat transfer. In case of the isotropic calcium silicate material (bulk density 220 kg m- 3) {{no significant differences between}} the various methods have been found and the results can easily be correlated within ± 10 %. The fibre-mat results, however, show additional effects of the density (between 103 and 170 kg m- 3) and the fibre orientation. Big differences exceeding 30 % are found between plate and hot-wire results. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a steady-state thermal {{model of a}} <b>hot-wire</b> <b>instrument</b> applicable to atmospheric measurement of water content in clouds. In this application, the power required to maintain the wire at a given temperature is used to deduce the water content of the cloud. The model considers electrical resistive heating, axial conduction, convection to the flow, radiation to the surroundings, as well as energy loss due to the heating, melting, and evaporation of impinging liquid and or ice. All of these parameters can be varied axially along the wire. The model further introduces a parameter called the evaporation potential which locally gauges the maximum fraction of incoming water that evaporates. The primary outputs of the model are the steady-state power required to maintain a spatially-average constant temperature {{as well as the}} variation of that temperature and other parameters along the wire. The model is used to understand the sensitivity of the hot-wire performance to various flow and boundary conditions including a detailed comparison of dry air and wet (i. e. cloud-on) conditions. The steady-state power values are compared to experimental results from a Science Engineering Associates (SEA) Multi-Element probe, a commonly used water-content measurement instrument. The model results show good agreement with experiment for both dry and cloud-on conditions with liquid water content. For ice, the experimental measurements under read the actual water content due to incomplete evaporation and splashing. Model results, which account for incomplete evaporation, are still higher than experimental results where the discrepancy is attributed to splashing mass-loss which is not accounted in the model...|$|E

Part I: Measurements {{were made of}} the heat loss and recovery temperature of a fine hot-wire at a nominal Mach number of 5. 8. Data were obtained over an eight-fold range of Reynolds numbers in the transitional regime between continuum and free-molecule flow. At high Reynolds numbers, the heat transfer data agree well {{with the results of}} Laufer and McClellan, which were obtained at lower Mach numbers. At lower Reynolds numbers, the results indicate a monotonic transition between continuum and free molecule heat transfer laws. The slope of the heat transfer correlation also appears to vary monotonically, with Nu [ [...] . ] at high Reynolds numbers and Nu ~ Re for Re< < 1. Data on the wire recovery temperature (corresponding to zero net heat transfer) were obtained for free-stream Knudsen numbers between 0. 4 and 3. 0. Comparison with previous supersonic data suggests that for Mach numbers greater than about two the normalized variation of recovery temperature in the transitional regime is a unique function of the free-stream Knudsen number. The recent data of Vrebalovich (33) suggests that the relation between the normalized recovery temperature and Knudsen number found in this investigation also applies to subsonic and transonic flow. The steady-state hot-wire may be used to obtain two thermodynamic measurements: the rate of heat transfer from the wire and the wire recovery temperature. An illustrative experiment was performed {{in the wake of a}} transverse cylinder, using both <b>hot-wire</b> and pressure <b>instruments</b> in a redundant system of measurements. It was shown that good accuracy may be obtained with a hot-wire even when the Reynolds number based on wire diameter is small. Part II: A theoretical model of the near wake is derived following the ideas of Chapman. This model is based on the postulates of mass conservation in the base flow region, thin viscous shear layers, and a recompression process which is independent of Reynolds number. The analysis, which includes the effects of initial shear layer thickness and base flow temperature, shows that the characteristics of the near wake (base pressure, shear layer angle, etc.) are independent of Reynolds number, and that the shear layer and initial wake thicknesses are proportional to Re[ [...] . ]. A series of experiments are presented which show that the postulate of thin shear layers is invalid for Reynolds numbers less than about [ [...] . ]. At higher Reynolds numbers, the theory is qualitatively incorrect if the Mach number [ [...] . ] external to the shear layer is large. Detailed measurements with a steady-state hot-wire in the near wake of a two-dimensional circular cylinder indicate that the compression process at the neck is not isentropic, and that the maximum pressure rise occurs downstream of the stagnation point formed by the merging shear layers. Comparison between the experimental and theoretical results points out the importance of the base flow temperature and the initial shear layer profile in determining the observable characteristics of the near wake...|$|R
