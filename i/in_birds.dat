5|$|The mallard {{is a rare}} {{example of}} both Allen's Rule and Bergmann's Rule <b>in</b> <b>birds.</b> Bergmann's Rule, which states that polar forms tend to be larger than related ones from warmer climates, has {{numerous}} examples <b>in</b> <b>birds,</b> as in case of the Greenland mallard which {{is larger than the}} mallards further south. Allen's Rule says that appendages like ears tend to be smaller in polar forms to minimise heat loss, and larger in tropical and desert equivalents to facilitate heat diffusion, and that the polar taxa are stockier overall. Examples of this rule <b>in</b> <b>birds</b> are rare as they lack external ears, but the bill of ducks is supplied with a few blood vessels to prevent heat loss, and, as in the Greenland mallard, the bill is smaller than that of birds farther south, illustrating the rule.|$|E

5|$|Among animals, {{variable}} snow camouflage {{is a type}} {{of seasonal}} polyphenism with a distinct winter plumage or pelage. It is found <b>in</b> <b>birds</b> such as the rock ptarmigan, lagomorphs such as the Arctic hare, mustelids such as the stoat, and one canid, the Arctic fox. Since these have evolved separately, the similar appearance is due to convergent evolution. Some high Arctic species like the snowy owl and polar bear however remain white all year round.|$|E

Samples of shedding were collected using a sterile swab to perform a bacterial culture in blood agar and McConkey agar. An antibiogram was performed as well. The bacterial culture revealed the growing of Proteus sp. and Proteus vulgares, respectively. The antibiogram performed with the samples of bird [A 1] showed the resistance to the follow antibiotics: ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, aztreonam, cefepime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and gentamicin. <b>In</b> <b>bird</b> [A 2], strain was resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, aztreonam, cefotoxin, chloramphenicol, tetraciclin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and gentamicina.

5|$|Many modern {{birds are}} highly social, often found living in flocks.

This explains the rapid appearance of migratory behavior after the most recent glacial maximum.|$|E
