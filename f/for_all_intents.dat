5|$|Heydrich was, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> and purposes, {{military}} dictator of Bohemia and Moravia. His {{changes to}} the government's structure left President Emil Hacha and his cabinet virtually powerless. He often drove alone {{in a car with}} an open roof—a show of his confidence in the occupation forces and in his government's effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Zrínyi saw {{action in}} the Adriatic Sea. She served with the Second Division of the Austro-Hungarian Navy's battleships and shelled Senigallia {{as part of the}} {{bombardment}} of the key seaport of Ancona, Italy, during May 1915. However, Allied control of the Strait of Otranto meant that the Austro-Hungarian Navy was, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> and purposes, effectively bottled up in the Adriatic. Nonetheless, the presence of the Zrínyi and other battleships tied down a substantial force of Allied ships.|$|E
5|$|With the Ordos now {{adequately}} fortified, the Mongols avoided {{its walls}} by riding east to invade Datong and Xuanfu (宣府; present-day Xuanhua, Hebei Province), which were two major garrisons guarding {{the corridor to}} Beijing where no walls had been built. The two defence lines of Xuanfu and Datong left by the Northern Qi and the early Ming had deteriorated by this point, and <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> and purposes the inner line was the capital's main line of defence.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the next}} few hours a fierce {{exchange}} of fire took place. In the process John Wahl moved in and rescued Gert Botha. Bok Kriel also moved in and rescues Jaco Kotze. Again John Wahl moved in and rescued Giel Visser. This he did without his gunner as to make space for Giel and <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>intent</b> and purposes were thus unarmed.Taljaard was killed and Bok Kriel got wounded for the second time, in his neck.|$|R
50|$|Nirit {{was founded}} on January 19, 1982 and was named after an {{indigenous}} plant, Ridolfia segetum, growing nearby. It expanded twice, once in 1986-1988 and again in 2000. Until 1986 there were only 15 families in temporary buildings, and nowadays it grew to about 240 families. In 2005 a new neighborhood named Nof Hasharon was built adjacent to Nirit. This neighborhood is located just outside the Green Line, actually belongs to the settlement Alfei Menashe, but in reality merged with Nirit <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>intent</b> and purpose.|$|R
50|$|CJZN {{signed on}} {{for the first time}} on January 18, 1950 as CKDA, {{initially}} broadcasting on 1340 AM at 250 watts under the ownership of Capital Broadcasting System Ltd. (headed by founder David Armstrong). On August 1, 1954, CKDA moved to 1280 AM and increased its power to 5000 watts; in 1955, CKDA-FM was signed on as a simulcast of CKDA-AM, and was <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>intent</b> the studio transmitter link to the off-shore transmitter site. On September 18, 1957, the AM station moved to 1220 kHz and doubled its power to 10,000 watts.|$|R
5|$|The dam was completed, and Beaver Lake was at {{full height}} by June 1966. <b>For</b> <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> and purposes, Harvey's Monte Ne was gone. However, {{in times of}} drought, some of the {{structures}} become visible again. The lake dropped to its lowest level on January 22, 1977, more than 27feet (8m) below its average depth, and the amphitheater and bridges were visible {{for the first time}} in more than 10 years. Before the water flooded downtown Monte Ne again, the rest of the buildings were either bulldozed or moved to avoid problems for swimmers, boaters, and fishermen. The few bridges that spanned the lagoon and the amphitheater were not demolished.|$|E
5|$|Timmy {{prepares to}} gun down Langly and Frohike, but is {{injected}} with the mind control drug by Byers. As it {{takes hold of}} him and he collapses, and the Lone Gunmen successfully mind-control him into turning himself in. Byers explains to Susanne Modeski that, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> and purposes, she is deceased and {{that she has a}} new identity. She asks Byers to go with her to start a new life, but he explains he has to keep up the fight. She kisses him goodbye and hands over a wedding ring meant for Grant Ellis.|$|E
5|$|Although {{formally}} {{separate from}} Greek Orthodox and Latin (Catholic) Christians, the Armenians consider their quarter {{to be part}} of the Christian Quarter. The three Christian patriarchates of Jerusalem and the government of Armenia have publicly expressed their opposition to any political division of the two quarters. The central reasons for the existence of a separate Armenian Quarter is the miaphysitism and distinct language and culture of the Armenians, who, unlike the majority of Christians in Jerusalem (also in Israel and Palestine), are neither Arab nor Palestinian. However, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> and purposes, the Armenians living in the Armenian Quarter are considered Palestinians by Israel and the United Nations (UN). They have faced many of the same restrictions on their lives as have the Palestinians.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the decline}} of the Mughal power, the region of Deccan saw the rise of Maratha Empire. The Nizam himself saw many invasions by the Marathas in the 1720s, which {{resulted}} in the Nizam paying a regular tax (Chauth) to the Marathas. The major battles fought between the Marathas and the Nizam include Palkhed, Bhopal, Rakshasbhuvan, and Kharda, in all of which the Nizam lost. Following the conquest of Deccan by Bajirao I and the imposition of chauth by him, Nizam remained a tributary of the Marathas <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>intent</b> and purposes.|$|R
50|$|The {{president}} {{has the right to}} legitimise children born out of wedlock, upon request by the parents. Since Austrian law, <b>for</b> (almost) <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> and purposes, no longer differentiates between legitimate and illegitimate children, this is no longer of any practical importance.|$|R
40|$|<b>For</b> <b>all</b> <b>intent</b> and {{purposes}} the United States of America in 1927 was an apartheid state. The Plessy v. Ferguson decision in 1896 {{determined that the}} best social policy for this nation to pursue was one which required racial separation. The Plessy decision essentially capped a series of Supreme Court decisions which underscored the destruction of Reconstruction {{and the return of}} 2 ̆ 2 states rights 2 ̆ 2 to southern governments. Decisions like the Slaughter House Cases (1872) and the Civil Rights Cases (1883) gave clear evidence of the federal government 2 ̆ 7 s hasty retreat from serving as an advocate for the civil rights of African Americans...|$|R
5|$|Production of {{components}} would be split between Breguet and BAC, and the aircraft themselves would be assembled on two production lines; {{one in the}} UK and one in France, To avoid any duplication of work, each aircraft component had only one source. The British light strike/tactical support versions were the most demanding design, requiring supersonic performance, superior avionics, a cutting edge nav/attack system of more accuracy and complexity than the French version, moving map display, laser range-finder and marked-target seeker (LRMTS). As a result, the initial Br.121 design needed a thinner wing, redesigned fuselage, a higher rear cockpit, and after-burning engines. While putting on smiling faces for the public, maintaining {{the illusion of a}} shared design, the British design de facto departed from the French sub-sonic Breguet 121 {{to such a degree that}} it was <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> and purposes a new design.|$|E
25|$|Blackfoot syllabics have, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> and purposes, disappeared. Present day Blackfoot {{speakers}} use a Latin alphabet, {{and very}} few Blackfoot can still read—much less write—the syllabic system.|$|E
25|$|For example, MCC was {{authorised}} {{to determine}} the status of matches played in Great Britain. <b>For</b> <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> and purposes, the 1947 ICC definition confirmed the 1894 MCC definition and gave it international recognition and usage.|$|E
50|$|The rule {{also failed}} {{every step of}} the {{proportionality}} test. The relationship between alcohol and crime was not substantial enough to rationally link the two. As well, the rule was less than minimally impairing as it provided exemption <b>for</b> <b>all</b> general <b>intent</b> crimes.|$|R

50|$|Caroliner's members are, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> public <b>intents</b> and purposes, anonymous. The band {{itself has}} never officially {{disclosed}} {{any of its}} identities. Instead, nonsensical aliases are used, like Obsidian Skeleton, The Sickwood Adventure, and Cottypearile Weddingforke. The aliases are only used during interviews with the band; no credits appear on any Caroliner records.|$|R
25|$|The Slaver stasis field, {{which causes}} {{time in the}} {{enclosed}} volume to stand still; since time has <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> and purposes ceased for an object in stasis, no harm can come to anything within the field.|$|E
25|$|Whether {{it was the}} public's {{resistance}} to disco, {{or the lack of}} Dread's popular frontman, Tortelvis, sales of It's Not Unusual were disappointing. The band was dropped by IRS and <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> and purposes, had broken up.|$|E

5000|$|Before the fire, {{however, the}} band were looking towards a new musical direction. In a 2009 {{interview}} with QTheMusic.com, Andy Williams stated that, [...] "As Sub Sub we {{never made the}} album {{we thought we were}} all capable of. We'd always been in love with the idea of albums as opposed to just singles - which are cool in their way and suit dance music perfectly but we wanted to stretch ourselves and make a statement with a set of songs. So around 1996 we started writing and recording the songs which would finally become Lost Souls. We were <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>intent</b> and purposes still Sub Sub (we only called ourselves Doves a week or two before The Cedar Room was released, because we wanted a fresh start and a break from the past)." ...|$|R
25|$|With {{tensions}} rising, a 1986 accord {{negotiated in}} Jabuuti between the Siyad Barre regime of Somalia and Mengistu Haile Miriam of Ethiopia {{to end the}} support of the respective rebellions against their regimes had <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>intent</b> and purposes entailed the dismemberment the SNM. Having lost its Ethiopian sanctuary, as a consequence of this agreement, in May 1988 the SNM waged a historically daring invasion on Togdheer and Northwest regions of Somaliland. With this secretly and meticulously planned attack—a shocking surprise to both Siyad Barre and Mingeste Haile Miriam regimes — SNM fighters easily took Burao (Burco) and Hargeisa (Hargeysa) cities. Although the SNM was finally pushed out of the two cities, the lightning attack proved to be the deathblow of the Siyad Barre regime. The end result being the peaceful transfer of power, in a spirit of unity, at the 1990 SNM Congress — a lasting peace that survives today.|$|R

25|$|<b>For</b> <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> and purposes, Creole is {{an ethnic}} and {{linguistic}} denomination. Some natives, even with blonde {{hair and blue}} eyes, may call themselves Creoles. The designation is more racial than cultural, and is evident to physical appearance.|$|E

25|$|<b>For</b> <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> and purposes, the AA {{ceased to}} exist and {{function}} after it was subsumed by SWOC. Philip Murray was appointed director of SWOC, and ran the organization (and union) until his death. Murray oversaw a $500,000 budget and 36 organizers.|$|E
6000|$|Freddie's mouth slowly opened. He {{was trying}} not to realize the meaning of what his friend was saying.

60|$|But for a {{long time}} Hester sat beside the sinking fire. Her brother, whom she loved and admired, {{differed}} slightly, but noticeably in one or two respects, from any of the prairie farmers she had known. Though it was hard to procure books, he had read widely and about other subjects than agriculture. Odd tricks of thought and speech also suggested the difference; but she knew that nobody else except her mother had noticed it, <b>for,</b> to <b>all</b> <b>intents,</b> Craig was merely a shrewd, hard-working grower of wheat.|$|R
5000|$|The word {{is derived}} from popor, meaning [...] "people" [...] in Romanian.

25|$|The last Spacemen 3 album, Recurring, {{was finally}} {{released}} in February 1991. Although the band had not officially disbanded, <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> and purposes {{it was a}} posthumous release. The {{two sides of the}} album – one by Kember (A-side), the other by Pierce (B-side) – reflected the split between the band's two main personnel.|$|E
25|$|<b>For</b> <b>all</b> <b>intents</b> and purposes, {{the coup}} {{destroyed}} Gorbachev politically. On 24 August, he advised the Central Committee to dissolve, resigned as general secretary and dissolved all party units within the government. Shortly afterward, the Supreme Soviet suspended all Party activities on Soviet territory. In effect, Communist {{rule in the}} Soviet Union had ended—thus eliminating the only unifying force left in the country.|$|E
25|$|Peter III's son, Frederick III of Sicily (also {{known as}} Frederick II of Sicily) reigned from 1298 to 1337.

50|$|Parties cannot create {{contractual}} obligations that {{are impossible to}} perform.

In the case of initial impossibility, the contractual obligation is void; in the case of supervening impossibility, performance becomes impossible after conclusion of the contract. The obligation then terminates. Where a party makes performance impossible, however, the obligation does not terminate: Such a party commits breach of contract.|$|R
5000|$|The {{last of the}} Tri-Five Chevrolets {{introduced}} several changes, {{including the}} large tailfins, [...] "twin rocket" [...] hood design, even more chrome, tri-color paint and a choice from no less than seven different V8 engines. [...] While in 1957, Ford outsold Chevrolet {{for the first time}} in a great while, years later the used 1957 Chevrolets would sell for hundreds more than their Ford counterparts. [...] As the horsepower race continued, Chevrolet introduced a new version of their small block, with 283 cubic inches of displacement and 245 horsepower. They also introduced a limited number of Rochester fuel injected 283 engines that produced 283 horsepower, the first production engine to achieve 1 horsepower per cubic inch. [...] <b>For</b> <b>all</b> <b>intent</b> and purposes, this made the 1957 Bel Air a [...] "hot rod", right off the production line. It was available with manual transmission only. The base 265cid engine saw an increase from 170 to 185 horsepower as well. While not as popular as the previous year's offering, Chevrolet still managed to sell 1.5 million cars in 1957. [...] Even now, the 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air is one of the most sought after collector cars ever produced.|$|R
