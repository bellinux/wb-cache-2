40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 68 - 69) This report {{describes the}} design and development of an integrated circuit capable of performing image correlation, specifically template matching. Its uniqueness lies in its use as the building block in a systolic array. The number of LSI's used to form the array {{is determined by the}} size of the template used in a match. The systolic architecture allows a constant flow of data through the array so that multiple correlation computations can proceed simultaneously. The <b>Image</b> <b>Correlator</b> LSI was designed and its performances were obtained through simulation testing. An <b>image</b> <b>correlator</b> was then designed by interconnecting several <b>image</b> <b>correlator</b> LSI's to form a systolic array. Simulation tests on the array indicated that the system performed as designed...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the use of}} optical memory disks in optical pattern recognition systems. Algorithmic and architectural issues associated with the realization of such systems are discussed. Experimental demonstrations of several optical disk-based architectures are included {{to aid in the}} understanding of system limitations and performance issues. First we discuss correlation-based pattern recognition and {{describe the}} relationship between this approach and the neural paradigm. The need for invariances in image recognition leads to the notion of the reference image library. This approach is shown to be attractive in the case of limited processor and spatial light modulator dynamic range. We characterize the optical disk as a parallel readout device. An overview of optical storage media is included. Parallel readout of data from Sony sampled format media is characterized. We identify a match between the characteristics of the optical disk and the requirements for pattern recognition systems. Four optical disk-based <b>image</b> <b>correlators</b> which may serve as building blocks in disk-based pattern recognition systems are introduced. These <b>image</b> <b>correlators</b> are experimentally demonstrated and compared in terms of speed, efficiency, and sensitivity to noise sources and disk imperfections. We discuss advantages and limitations of these systems. We include a discussion of learning and generalization in neural networks. We present a new learning algorithm and discuss its generalization characteristics. Three disk-based systems for pattern recognition are proposed. The first is a correlation-based architecture. The performance of this system as compared with theoretical expectations is encouraging; however, data rate constraints suggest the investigation of an alternate approach. The next two systems are more neurally inspired and realize the k-nearest neighbor and radial basis function algorithms. An evaluation of the performance of these two systems is presented with respect to the handwritten digit recognition problem. Lastly, we present two candidates for future optoelectronic computing and pattern recognition systems. We detail the operation of these architectures and discuss the need for {{a better understanding of the}} relationship between mass memory and a general parallel processing environment...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{radio telescopes}} are favouring densely packed array layouts {{with large numbers}} of antennas (N_A≳ 1000). Since the {{complexity}} of traditional correlators scales as O(N_A^ 2), there will be a steep cost for realizing the full imaging potential of these powerful instruments. Through our generic and efficient E-field Parallel <b>Imaging</b> <b>Correlator</b> (EPIC), we present the first software demonstration of a generalized direct imaging algorithm, namely, the Modular Optimal Frequency Fourier (MOFF) imager. Not only does it bring down the cost for dense layouts to O(N_A_ 2 N_A) but can also image from irregular layouts and heterogeneous arrays of antennas. EPIC is highly modular, parallelizable, implemented in object-oriented Python, and publicly available. We have verified the images produced to be equivalent to those from traditional techniques to within a precision set by gridding coarseness. We have also validated our implementation on data observed with the Long Wavelength Array (LWA 1). We provide a detailed framework for imaging with heterogeneous arrays and show that EPIC robustly estimates the input sky model for such arrays. Antenna layouts with dense filling factors consisting {{of a large number of}} antennas such as LWA, the Square Kilometre Array, Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array, and Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment will gain significant computational advantage by deploying an optimized version of EPIC. The algorithm is a strong candidate for instruments targeting transient searches of Fast Radio Bursts (FRB) as well as planetary and exoplanetary phenomena due to the availability of high-speed calibrated time-domain images and low output bandwidth relative to visibility-based systems.

With only 3 mW of power incident upon the SI-MQW device, the correlation is obtained in 1 microsec {{and can be}} erased in as fast as 2 microsec, which presents {{the possibility of a}} system capable of 3 x 10 exp 5 correlations/s. We also show that images can be stored for a controllable length of time (2 - 25 microsec), which presents possibilities {{for the use of the}} SI-MQW device as a data or image buffer memory...|$|E

The use of conventional contour generation methods, such as the photogrammetric plotting technique, electronic correlator, and digital correlator are described. Coherent optical techniques for contour generation are discussed and compared to the electronic correlator. The optical techniques are divided into two categories: (1) image plane operation and (2) frequency plane operation. The description of image plane correlators are further divided into three categories: (1) image to <b>image</b> <b>correlator,</b> (2) interferometric correlator, and (3) positive negative transparencies. The frequency plane correlators are divided into two categories: (1) correlation of Fourier transforms, and (2) filtering techniques...|$|E
40|$|Investigation {{has been}} {{conducted}} into means of improving the <b>image</b> <b>correlator</b> and overlay function portions of the LARS image registration system. The fast Fourier transform correlator was analysed in detail and a modified version was programmed and tested. More reliable and accurate correlation has been achieved on both multispectral and multitemporal scanner imagery and Apollo 9 digitised multispectral photography. A quadratic overlay function was developed which uses local correlation checkpoints to interpolate the required overlay shifts between checkpoints. these improvements are described in the memo. The modified correlator is checked out and ready {{for inclusion in the}} registration system. More work is required on the overly function to implement it in the system...|$|E
40|$|Photorefractive quantum wells are dynamic {{holographic}} {{materials that}} combine {{the advantages of}} large excitonic electroabsorption with large carrier mobilities to produce high-sensitivity holographic devices operable at extremely low optical intensities compatible with image processing applications. They are finding a niche as versatile optical devices in systems such as joint <b>image</b> <b>correlators,</b> femtosecond autocorrelators, laser-based ultrasound detection, and time-to-space mapping. These devices contain high defect densities which trap and store photogenerated carriers. The trapped space-charge results in a spatially varying space-charge field that matches the periodicity of the incident intensity pattern, which alters the optical properties of the device. The principal objective {{of the present study}} was to develop a new material system (low-temperature-grown AlGaAs/GaAs quantum wells) for photorefractive applications. We have achieved ultrafast electron recombination lifetimes in combination with sharp excitonic features, a goal which was considered mutually exclusive, by engineering low-temperature-grown AlAs/GaAs quantum wells. This material system was used to develop photorefractive p-i-n quantum well diodes operating in the quantum-confined Stark geometry for holographic applications. These photorefractive diodes operate with photocarrier transport perpendicular to the grating vector, unlike traditional photorefractive materials. They operate under transient electrical excitation resulting in a rich variety of spatio-temporal dynamics. We have optimized these devices to achieve record output diffraction efficiencies and shown that the design of these devices is relatively flexible as long as the principal functions of photoconductivity, electro-optics, and charge trapping are supplied by one or several functional layers. Nonreciprocal energy transfer, normally forbidden in Stark-effect devices, has been achieved using moving gratings. This led to the development of these photorefractive diodes to measure Doppler shifts by using electrically strobed gratings. Related to this work on longitudinal geometries, transverse-field photorefractive quantum wells were developed as adaptive beamsplitters to interrogate surface vibrations for laser-based ultrasound detection systems. These devices are tuned to quadrature for true linear detection by tailoring the excitonic spectral phase, a new contribution that is unique to the photorefractive quantum wells. This work has evolved from the physics of semi-insulating materials, to optimizing devices, to building complete systems using photorefractive quantum wells. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavior}} of digital cross-correlation algorithms {{as applied to}} image matching problems is examined {{in terms of the}} relationship between measureable image properties and algorithm characteristics. Statistical image quality measures are developed which could be employed in a preprocessor to predict the performance of automatic stereo-compilation equipment. The measures include a quantity derived from the Cramer-Rao lower bound on the variance of any unbiased parameter estimator, various contrast measures such as variance, contrast modulation, and median absolute deviation, and a stationarity detector related to the variance gradient. These measures are based on <b>image</b> and <b>correlator</b> models which describe the {{behavior of}} correlation processors under conditions of low image contrast or signal-to-noise ratio, geometric distortion, and image non-stationarity. Computer simulations using synthetic imagery were performed to verify the various models, and indicate the potential for the use of image quality measures in the predicting of correlation behavior. Implications of the models in terms of correlation processor design and implementation are discussed...|$|R

The correlation filter and the input image are displayed on commercial liquid-crystal television ~LCTV! panels. Although it cannot handle high-resolution <b>images,</b> the incoherent <b>correlator</b> is lensless, compact, low cost, and uses a white-light source. A bipolar technique is devised to represent any linear filter, computed from a single reference image or composite, in the correlator.

40|$|At {{the present}} time, {{arguments}} continue regarding the migration speeds of Martian dune fields and their correlation with atmospheric circulation. However, precisely measuring the spatial translation of Martian dunes has been rarely successful {{due to the}} technical difficulties to quantitatively observe expected small surface migrations. Therefore, we developed a generic procedure to measure the migration of dune fields employing a high-accuracy photogrammetric processor and sub-pixel <b>image</b> <b>correlator</b> on the 25 -cm resolution High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE). The established algorithms have been tested over a few Martian dune fields. Consequently, migrations over well-known crater dune fields appeared to be almost static for the considerable temporal periods and were weakly correlated with wind directions estimated by the Mars Climate Database. Only over some Martian dune fields, such as Kaiser crater, meaningful migration speeds (>  1 m/year) considering photogrammetric error residual have been detected. Currently a technically improved processor to compensate error residual using time series observation is under development and expected to produce the long term migration speed over Martian dune fields where constant HiRISE image acquisitions are available...|$|E

40|$|Thermal {{monitoring}} {{is useful}} for revealing some ser ious electrical problems in a factory that often go undetected until a serious breakdown occurs. In facto ries, there are various types of functioning machines to be monitored. When there is any malfunctioning of a machine, extra heat will be generated which can {{be picked up by}} thermal camera for image processing and identification purpose. In this paper, a new and effective omnidirectional machine condition monitoring system applying log-polar mapper, quaternion based thermal <b>image</b> <b>correlator</b> and max-product fuzzy neural network classifier is proposed for monitoring machine condition in an omnidirectional view. With this monitoring system, it is convenient to detect and monitor the conditions of (overheat or not) of more than one machines in an omnidirectional view captured by using a single thermal camera. Log-polar mapping tec hnique is used to unwarp omnidirectional thermal image into panoramic form. Two classification characteristics namely: peak to sidelobe ratio (PSR) and real to complex ratio of the discrete quaternion correlation output (p-value) are applied in the proposed machine condition monitoring system. Large PSR and p-value observe in a good match among correlation of the input thermal image with a particular reference image, while small PSR and p-value observe in a bad/not match among correlation of the input thermal image with a particular reference image. Simulation results also show that the proposed system is an efficient omnidirectional machine monitoring system with accuracy more than 97...|$|E

40|$|A report {{discusses}} the continuing development of Windows Interface for Nominal Displacement Selection (WINDS), {{a computer program}} for automated analysis of images of the Sun and planets acquired by scientific instruments aboard spacecraft. WINDS is intended to afford capabilities for identification of features, measurement of displacements and velocities, analysis of terrain and of atmospheres, and synthesis of animation sequences of images of terrains and atmospheres from small sets of samples by use of velocity-based interpolation. A major element of WINDS will be a nonlinear correlator capable of tracking small features in complex image sequences.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Pattern recognition is a rapidly expanding area of research, with applications ranging from character recognition and component inspection to robotic guidance and military reconnaissance. The basic principle of image recognition is that of comparing the unknown image with many known reference images or 'filters', until a match is found. By comparing the unknown image with a large data bank of filters, {{the diversity of the}} application can be extended. The work presented in this thesis details the practical development of an optical disk based memory system as applied in various optical correlators for pattern recognition purposes. The characteristics of the holographic optical disk as a storage medium are investigated in terms of information capacity and signal to noise ratio, where a fully automated opto-mechanical system has been developed for the control of the optical disk and the processing of the information recorded. A liquid crystal television {{has been used as a}} Spatial Light Modulator for inputting the image data, and as such, the device characteristics have been considered with regard to processing both amplitude and phase information. Three main configurations of optical correlator have been applied, specifically an <b>image</b> plane <b>correlator,</b> a VanderLugt correlator, and an Anamorphic correlator. Character recognition has been used to demonstrate correlator performance, where simple matched filtering has been applied, subsequent to which, an improvement in class discrimination has been demonstrated with the application of the Minimum Average Correlation Energy filter. The information processing rate obtained as a result of applying 2 D parallel processing has been shown to be many orders of magnitude larger than that available with comparable serial based digital systems...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} results of our {{experimental}} investigation on a shift-invariant photorefractive <b>image</b> <b>correlator</b> that uses a thin crystal plate of Fe:LiNbO 3, which operates in the Raman-Nath regime of diffraction. Optical image correlators can play an essential role in applications such as machine vision, target detection, and pattern recognition. They have the advantages of processing a large amount of information in a parallel fashion. The joint-transform correlator {{is one of the most}} widely studied architectures that perform optical image correlation. 1 - 2 It is especially suitable for real-time applications when used in con-junction with photorefractive crystals. Over the past few years, a variety of real-time optical image correla-tors have been demonstrated by using either a spatial light modulator or a photorefractive crystal in the Fourier domain. 3 - 9 Although the technology of spa-tial light modulators has advanced rapidly, the de-vices still have poor resolutions compared with pho-torefractive crystals. Photorefractive crystals have the capability of real-time operation and an extremely high sensitivity for certain materials such as sillen-ites and compound semiconductors. On the other hand, owing to the nature of Bragg diffraction from the volume hologram, the photorefractive-crystal-based optical correlators have a narrow field of view, which is responsible for the lack of shift invariance. In this Note, we present experimental studies of a joint-transform correlator that uses a thin photore-fractive crystal plate and investigate the shift-invariant properties of the correlator. The results show that, by using the thin photorefractive crystal in the Fourier domain, the correlators have the com...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOver {{the last}} 10 years, the {{accessibility}} of high spatial resolution remote sensing images has strongly increased. These images are available in ortho-rectified format which do not necessitate any further geometrical processing to be analyzed. In parallel, image correlation software has become more efficient and friendly. In this paper, image correlation methods are tested to evaluate their potential and limitations to measure the surface displacements in a complex case of a landslide located in a tropical environment. This studied landslide, called “Mare à Poule d’Eau”, {{is located in the}} Salazie erosion watershed in Réunion Island (France). This landslide is monitored daily by a DGPS station which registers the south-north displacements. Two pairs of ortho-rectified SPOT- 5 images at 2. 5 m resolution provided by Kalideos ([URL] were selected. The first pair frames the period between 2002 and 2005 during which the landslide activity was low. The second pair of images (2006 – 2008) frames a period of time during which the landslide was more active. Fifty-nine Image Control Points (ICP) were selected on the images by the SIFT method (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) and visually controlled. The shifts of these points used as external control are estimated for the two time periods. Two <b>image</b> <b>correlator</b> softwares are used: MicMac and Cosi-Corr. The results obtained by the two correlators are similar. For the 2002 – 2005 period, the shift measured by correlators in the landslide is similar to the shift outside the landslide. This means that the displacement cannot be detected and estimated during periods of low activity of the landslide. The shift of the landslide for the 2006 – 2008 period is out of noise and reaches 8. 5 m. The displacement can be estimated by applying a correction factor extracted from the ICP located in the stable areas. The potential and limits of the image correlation in such complex environments is discussed. A strategy is proposed to evaluate the quality of the results and to extract the displacement signal from the shift measurements...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. {{technology}} {{to support a}} CEV AR&D activity is mature and was developed by NASA and supporting industry during an extensive research and development program conducted during the 1990 's and early 2000 time frame at the Marshall Space Flight Center. Development and demonstration of a rendezvous/docking sensor was identified early in the AR&D Program as the critical enabling technology that allows automated proxin~ity operations and docking. A first generation rendezvous/docking sensor, the Video Guidance Sensor (VGS) was developed and successfully flown on STS 87 and again on STS 95, proving {{the concept of a}} video-based sensor. Advances in both video and signal processing technologies and the lessons learned from the two successful flight experiments provided a baseline {{for the development of a}} new generation of video based rendezvous/docking sensor. The Advanced Video Guidance Sensor (AVGS) has greatly increased performance and additional capability for longer-range operation. A Demonstration Automatic Rendezvous Technology (DART) flight experiment was flown in April 2005 using AVGS as the primary proximity operations sensor. Because of the absence of a docking mechanism on the target satellite, this mission did not demonstrate the ability of the sensor to co~ltrold ocking. Mission results indicate that the rendezvous sensor operated successfully in "spot mode" (2 km acquisition of the target, bearing data only) but was never commanded to "acquire and track" the docking target. Parts obsolescence issues prevent the construction of current design AVGS units to support the NASA Exploration initiative. This flight proven AR&D technology is being modularized and upgraded with additional capabilities through the Hydra project at the Marshall Space Flight Center. Hydra brings a unique engineering approach and sensor architecture to the table, to solve the continuing issues of parts obsolescence and multiple sensor integration. This paper presents an approach to sensor hardware trades, to address the needs of future vehicles that may rendezvous and dock with the International Space Station (ISS). It will also discuss approaches for upgrading AVGS to address parts obsolescence, and concepts for modularizing the sensor to provide configuration flexibility for multiple vehicle applications. Options for complementary sensors to be integrated into the multi-head Hydra system will also be presented. Complementary sensor options include ULTOR, a digital <b>image</b> <b>correlator</b> system that could provide relative six-degree-of-freedom information independently from AVGS, and time-of-flight sensors, which determine the range between vehicles by timing pulses that travel from the sensor to the target and back. Common targets and integrated targets, suitable for use with the multi-sensor options in Hydra, will also be addressed...|$|E
