The inhibition was non-competitive, the decrease of the maximum initial velocity following exponential kinetics. Glucose transport was not significantly affected either by ethanol (up to 13 %, w/v) or by acetic acid (up to 1. 5 %, w/v). The uptake of labelled acetic acid followed simple diffusion kinetics, indicating that a carrier was not involved in its transport. Therefore, the undissociated acid appears to be the only form that enters the cells and is probably responsible for the toxic effects.

It can be formed as a byproduct of alcoholic fermentation or as a product of the metabolism of acetic and lactic acid bacteria, which can metabolize residual sugars to increase volatile acidity.

In this minireview, we present an overview of fermentation conditions and grape-must composition favoring acetic acid formation, as well the metabolic pathways leading to its formation and degradation by yeast. The negative effect of acetic acid on the fermentative performance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae will also be covered, including its role as a physiological inducer of apoptosis.

40|$|Grape musts {{sometimes}} reveal excess acidity. An excessive {{amount of}} organic acids negatively affect wine yeasts and yeast fermentation, and the obtained wines {{are characterized by}} an inappropriate balance between sweetness, acidity or sourness, and flavor/aroma components. An appropriate acidity, pleasant to the palate {{is more difficult to}} achieve in wines that have high acidity due to an excess of malic acid, because the Saccharomyces species in general, cannot effectively degrade malic acid during alcoholic fermentation. One approach to solving this problem is biological <b>deacidification</b> <b>by</b> lactic acid bacteria or non-Saccharomyces yeasts, like Schizosaccharomyces pombe that show the ability to degrade L-malic acid. Excessive volatile acidity in wine is also a problem in the wine industry. The use of free or immobilized Saccharomyces cells has been studied to solve both these problems since these yeasts are wine yeasts that show a good balance between taste/flavor and aromatic compounds during alcoholic fermentation. The aim of this review is to give some insights into the use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains to perform biological demalication (malic acid degradation) and deacetification (reduction of volatile acidity) of wine in an attempt to better understand their biochemistry and enological features...|$|R

The efficacy of stabilisation of highly lignified wood-containing paper by the carbonated magnesium propylate in the liquified gas of the 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3 -heptafluoropropane (HFC 227) was measured and compared with deacidification of the same paper by hexamethyldisiloxane, and air-water based deacidifying processes. The wood-containing paper test books were deacidified in Preservation Academy Leipzig, air-conditioned at the relative humidity RH = 50 %, and aged in sealed bags at 96 ± 2 °C. The kinetics of folding endurance (ω), tensile strength (lt) were measured and the indexes of relative increase of the lifetime (Sτ, ω), the folding endurance (Sω, t) and the tensile strength (Slt, t) were calculated.

40|$|Paper {{lamination}} is {{a widely}} known method to consolidate fragile and brittle documents. Since the loss of mechanical strength of paper documents is almost completely due to their acidity, the procedure generally adopted by restorers consists of an aqueous treatment of <b>deacidification</b> followed <b>by</b> consolidation. The drawback of this method {{is due to the}} loss of paper fragments during the deacidification step, that must be therefore accurately controlled. Some preliminary experiments showed that a better and faster practice would be the lamination of paper documents with a water-resistant sheet before their immersion in the deacidification bath. The aim of this work is to evaluate the permeability, chemical stability and reversibility of the lamination sheets coated with two commercially available acrylic resins. From both gravimetric and FTIR analyses it appeared that slight modifications of the acrylic monomers led to different properties, and this behaviour can be exploited to improve the properties of lamination sheets in order to set up a reliable method of aqueous mass deacidification...|$|R

While this secondary fermentation can occur spontaneously, the majority of winemakers, particularly in new world winemaking regions, prefer to minimise the risk of a failed or sluggish MLF by inoculating with a reliable, commercially available starter culture. This review focuses on the scientific literature underpinning growing trends in the application of MLF starters. It considers the literature on co-inoculation regimes, where MLF bacteria are inoculated into a ferment prior to completion of alcoholic fermentation and what benefits this might bring relative to sequential inoculation, when bacteria are added after completion of primary fermentation. It also considers the benefits of the growing trend of using bacteria other than the traditional Oenococcus oeni for induction of MLF, and of developing starter cultures from regional isolates of MLF bacteria to enhance regional identity of wines.

The results showed that the positive charge of chitosan acted as a double-edged sword, in that it promoted erythrocyte adhesion, fibrinogen adsorption, and platelet adhesion and activation, but inhibited acti-vation of the contact system. In contrast to prevailing views, we found that the positive charge of chitosan retarded thrombin generation and blood coagulation on these films. At least two reasons were responsible for this phenomenon. First, the positive charge inhibited the contact activation, and second, the positive charge could not significantly promote the activation of non-adherent platelets in the bulk phase during the early stage of coagulation. The present findings improve our understanding of the events leading to blood coagulation on chitosan films, which will be useful for the future development of novel chitosan-based hemostatic devices...|$|R

40|$|Introduction : In Mediterranean regions, pH {{values are}} often {{considered}} {{too high and}} acidification by addition of tartaric acid is often used. A decrease in pH allows better control of wine oxidation, physico– chemical stability, microbiological development, SO 2 additions (1), and affects its sensory characteristics. Correction of pH by acidification is difficult to obtain with random results up to date, principally because high levels of pH are normally related {{to high levels of}} potassium ions (K+) and not only to organic acid contents. To decrease K+ contents and consequently pH, an electromembrane process with bipolar membranes has been recently tested in wine (2). This separative technique, under the effect of a continuous current and selective membranes (cationic and bipolar), permits the extraction of K+ ions and the free acid/salified acid equilibrium is displaced towards the acid form, thus lowering pH. Sourness, astringency and bitterness are three of the main sensory attributes of red wine. Different parameters such as alcohol (3 - 6), sweetness, viscosity (7), tannin and proanthocyanidin composition and concentration (4, 8), type and concentration of organic acids (9 - 11) and pH (5, 6, 10) have been shown to affect these sensory attributes in model solutions and wine. Sourness of wines (4, 12) and acid aqueous solutions (10, 13) is dependent of pH, and is also elicited by the concentration and anion species of the acid (10). Lowering the pH of wines (3, 6, 12) or model solutions (12) has no effect on bitterness. Adding acid has also been reported to increase the astringency of wine (5, 12) and model solutions (10, 12). Astringency elicited by acids is related to pH in aqueous solutions (10, 13, 14), and in white wine, but not in red wine (14). Wine micro-oxygenation may increase coarseness and colour intensity in a first phase, to later soften tannins (15). After a 6 month treatment of 0. 75 to 3 ml/l/month micro-oxygenation, moutounet et al. (16) observed a positive action over the hard and drying expression of red wines, together with a gain of structure. The evolution of native anthocyanins and their conversion to ethyl-bridged anthocyanin–flavanol adducts following wine microoxygenation have been reported (17). Involvement of tannins in these reactions may explain in part the decrease of astringency in wines. This research was conducted primarily to investigate the effects of a pH decrease obtained <b>by</b> an <b>electromembrane</b> process on sourness, bitterness and astringency perception in red wine after a 9 months storage. This was achieved by descriptive sensory analysis where all three sensory attributes are evaluated {{at the same time to}} simulate a real wine tasting...|$|R
40|$|Vegetable oils are {{important}} compounds {{of the human}} diet {{and they should be}} refined before consumption. Consumers demand for healthier products as well as stiff environmental legislation are forcing refining industries towards changes and improvement of processes. In this context, this thesis has as main objective to investigate/improve the physical refining of vegetable oils, emphasizing the bleaching step. As first step, a HPLC methodology for simultaneous quantification of carotenes and tocols was developed and validated, and lately, it was used by our research groups. Then, bleaching step of palm oil, nowadays the most consumed oil in the world, was studied under different aspects: (1) determining kinetics, equilibrium and thermodynamic parameters of adsorptive removal of carotenes and phosphorus onto acid activated bleaching earth; (2) influence of different procedures on final color of palm oil; (3) influence of bleaching earth kind on final color of palm oil. These studies were important for a better understanding of bleaching process of palm oil, and some conclusions were obtained: adsorptive removal of carotenes and phosphorus onto acid activated bleaching earth occurs by chemisorption and it is endothermic; new procedures in the bleaching step can improve final color of palm oil when using the same amount of bleaching earth and deodorization time; a hypothesis was proposed to explain how the kind of bleaching earth can interfere in the final color of palm oil. Further studies are still necessary to optimize bleaching step and the new procedures suggested. Later, physical <b>deacidification</b> was studied <b>by</b> computer simulation and experimental data from literature. It was compared two mathematical approaches: differential and flash distillations. This last one presented better results regarding acidity and neutral oil loss profiles. In this approach, it was considered the heat transfer equations. In this way, this thesis presents an advance in refining process towards high quality products and the use of less chemicals...|$|R
