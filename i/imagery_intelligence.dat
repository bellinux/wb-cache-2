2500|$|Further intelligence, {{including}} {{human intelligence}} and signals intelligence, indicated that Shah based his insurgent / terrorist operations {{out of some}} small structures outside of the village of Chichal, high {{on the slopes of}} Sawtalo Sar mountain in the upper Korangal Valley, approximately [...] to the west of Kunar's provincial capital, Asadabad. Using <b>imagery</b> <b>intelligence,</b> taken from a UAV on June 17, 2005, Westerfield identified likely structures used for housing his team, IED making, and overwatch of the area below, for IED strikes. The intelligence staff identified four Named Areas of Interest, or NAIs containing specific structures which Shah might be using. These Named Areas of Interest and specific buildings were determined by analyzing and processing a number of instances of a variety of intelligence, including signals intelligence, human intelligence, and <b>imagery</b> <b>intelligence.</b> Westerfield and his staff determined that Shah and his men had been responsible for approximately 11 incidents against American, Coalition, and Government of Afghanistan entities, including IED strikes and small arms ambushes. They determined that Shah and his men would be occupying the area of Chichal in late June, a time of low lunar illumination. The operation would require a helicopter insertion of forces to cordon the area and search for Shah and his men, and they sought to conduct this operation at night, after positive identification of Shah by a Marine Corps Scout / Sniper team, which would walk into the area under cover of darkness some nights before.|$|E
2500|$|What is in {{the open}} or under visible {{camouflage}} nets elsewhere is completely hidden within structures during urban contingencies (i.e., defeating conventional <b>imagery</b> <b>intelligence</b> IMINT) Further, movement of units is less frequently evident. Well-trained organizations minimize exterior activities; their soldiers remain within buildings to the maximum extent possible to reduce detection. Vehicles leave few signs of their passage on asphalt and concrete, unlike in other areas where their tracks {{can be seen in}} dirt or compressed foliage. The same LOS obstacles that interfere with friendly force communications block signal-collection efforts. The city foe will in some in stances employ local telephone systems, cellular networks, or other communications systems for which friendly force military SIGINT capabilities were not designed. [...] Such challenges mean that intelligence analysis during urban contingencies relies more on human intelligence (HUMINT) than is the norm.|$|E

Unlike a number of similar military forces, the Irish Defence Forces actively include intelligence as part of Officer and NCO education, but those selected to join the Directorate receive further specialist training. The Defence Forces run their own Defence Intelligence & Security Course (DISC). The course runs for a number of months and covers the main areas of intelligence operations, including the principles of intelligence operations, defence intelligence, intelligence analysis, and combat intelligence. The course is supported by additional [...] "on-the-job" [...] training as part of the Directorate. This includes additional weapons, surveillance and communications training to support ongoing operations. Further training in languages is available, and specialist training on sensitive subjects such as religion, culture, ethnicity and radicalisation are also provided.

40|$|DoD and Air Force {{direction}} is clear regarding acquisition of new systems and direction for legacy systems: service oriented implementation and net-centric sharing of data {{are no longer}} optional. A key challenge with this direction, however, {{is the ability to}} align services in terms of their capabilities, inputs, outputs, and other constraints â€“ what is referred to as schema matching and transformation. Without this capability key service-based initiatives such as Global Command and Control System- Integrated <b>Imagery</b> and <b>Intelligence</b> (GCCS-I 3) 1, which is a standard set of tools and services to accessing <b>imagery</b> and <b>intelligence,</b> will not be realized to their maximum potential. The schema matching and transformation needed to interoperate with such services has been a manual, tedious, and error prone task. While there has been some automation, the majority is based on syntactical comparisons. This paper illustrates how semantic modeling concepts can be applied to facilitate schema matching and transformation. Our approach leverages an ontology-based model that encodes semantics of the domain and determines how well services schema match the domain. Consequently schema is compared based on semantics, or the underlying intent of information exchange within the intended domain, versus a syntax-based comparison. 2...|$|R
