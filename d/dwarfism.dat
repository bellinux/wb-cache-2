5|$|<b>Dwarfism</b> was {{not seen}} as a defect in ancient Egypt, unlike in many other cultures. Egyptian texts advised the {{acceptance}} of those with physical or mental disabilities, and there were even two dwarf gods, Bes and Ptah.|$|E
5|$|Seneb's <b>dwarfism</b> is {{depicted}} realistically in the sculpture. It portrays {{him with a}} large head but small arms and legs. This possibly indicates that he had achondroplasia, a common form of <b>dwarfism</b> that most severely affects the fastest-growing {{parts of the body}} – particularly the femur and humerus, which become short and squat – and stunts the forearms and lower legs. It also affects the head, producing a relatively large skull with a bulging forehead and often a depressed nasal bridge. An alternative diagnosis is dysmelia – a condition that produces short arms and legs. Seneb's wife Senites is portrayed far less realistically; her depiction is of a piece with other contemporary portraits of high-ranking Egyptian women.|$|E
5|$|While the wrestler {{known as}} Espantito {{is known as}} a Mini-Estrella ("Mini-Star) it does not {{indicate}} that Espantito has <b>Dwarfism.</b> Unlike Midget professional wrestling where all competitors are under the height of , Mini-Estrellas are often wrestlers of shorter stature such as Espantito at , but not true Little People in a medical sense.|$|E
5|$|Although a clear {{relative}} to the common hippopotamus, H. lemerlei was much smaller, {{roughly the size of}} the modern pygmy hippopotamus. The largest specimens were 6.5ft (2 m) long and 2.5ft (0.7 m) tall. The ancestors of H. lemerlei may have been full-sized hippos who shrunk through the process of insular <b>dwarfism.</b> A similar dwarfing process has occurred with hippos in many Mediterranean islands such as with the Cretan dwarf hippopotamus or the Cyprus dwarf hippopotamus.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} {{proboscideans}} lived on islands and experienced insular <b>dwarfism.</b> This occurred primarily during the Pleistocene when some elephant populations became isolated by fluctuating sea levels, although dwarf elephants did exist {{earlier in the}} Pliocene. These elephants likely grew smaller on islands {{due to a lack}} of large or viable predator populations and limited resources. By contrast, small mammals such as rodents develop gigantism in these conditions. Dwarf proboscideans are known to have lived in Indonesia, the Channel Islands of California, and several islands of the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|The King Island emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae minor) is an extinct {{subspecies}} of emu {{that was}} endemic to King Island, which {{is situated in}} the Bass Strait between mainland Australia and Tasmania. Its closest relative may be the extinct Tasmanian emu (D. n. diemenensis), as they belonged to a single population until less than 14,000 years ago, when Tasmania and King Island were still connected. The small size of the King Island emu may {{be an example of}} insular <b>dwarfism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Three {{species of}} Malagasy {{hippopotamus}} became extinct during the Holocene on Madagascar, {{one of them}} within the past 1,000 years. The Malagasy hippos were smaller than the modern hippopotamus, likely {{through the process of}} insular <b>dwarfism.</b> Fossil evidence indicates many Malagasy hippos were hunted by humans, a likely factor in their eventual extinction. Isolated members of Malagasy hippopotamus may have survived in remote pockets; in 1976, villagers described a living animal called the kilopilopitsofy, which may have been a Malagasy hippopotamus.|$|E
5|$|At higher altitudes {{the trees}} {{gradually}} thin out {{and there are}} alpine pastures. These pastures are rich in flowers in the late spring. The wildflowers in the park's high meadows include wild pansies, gentians, martagon lilies, and alpenroses. The park has many rocky habitats. They are mostly located above the timberline and alpine pastures. These areas have rock and detritus on their surface. Alpine plants have adapted to these habitats by assuming characteristics like <b>dwarfism,</b> hairiness, bright coloured flowers, and highly developed roots. About 1,500 plant species {{can be seen at}} Paradisia Pyromaniacle Garden near Cogne inside the park.|$|E
5|$|During the Late Quaternary period (0.7 {{million years}} ago), small emus {{lived on a}} number of {{offshore}} islands of mainland Australia. In addition to the King Island emu, these included taxa found on Kangaroo Island (D.n.baudinianus) and Tasmania (D.n.diemenensis), all of which are now extinct. The smallest taxon, the King Island emu, was confined to a small island situated in the Bass Strait between Tasmania and Victoria, approximately 100km (62mi) from both coasts. King Island was once part of the land bridge which connected Tasmania and mainland Australia, but rising sea levels following the last glacial maximum eventually isolated the island. As a result of phenotypic plasticity the King Island emu population possibly underwent a process of insular <b>dwarfism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Seneb is {{depicted}} {{with his wife}} and children in a painted sculpture from his tomb, rediscovered in 1926, that is a famous example of Old Kingdom art. It shows him sitting cross-legged on a block of stone with his wife embracing him and his children standing below him where the legs of a full-size person would ordinarily have been. The composition of the scene thus achieves a harmonious symmetry. It depicts Seneb realistically with the facial features and shortened limbs of an individual with achondroplasia, a common form of <b>dwarfism.</b> Paintings and carvings in the tomb give his titles and depict various scenes from his life, such as carrying out inspections of his estate and holding symbols of his office.|$|E
5|$|Tigers first reached India and {{northern}} Asia {{in the late}} Pleistocene, reaching eastern Beringia (but not the American Continent), Japan, and Sakhalin. As evidenced by Sandra Herrington, some fossil skulls that are morphologically distinct from lion skulls could indicate however that tigers might have been present in Alaska within the last 100,000 years during the last glaciation. Fossils found in Japan indicate the local tigers were, like the surviving island subspecies, smaller than the mainland forms, an example of insular <b>dwarfism.</b> Until the Holocene, tigers also lived in Borneo, {{as well as on}} the island of Palawan in the Philippines. As of the Middle Ages, Caspian tigers were noted to range in the Pontic-Caspian steppes of Ukraine and southern Russia.|$|E
5|$|Every {{participant}} at the Paralympics {{has their}} disability grouped {{into one of}} five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly {{under one of the}} other categories, for example <b>dwarfism</b> or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.|$|E
5|$|Fearing for Shae's safety, Tyrion {{breaks up}} with her and orders her to leave for Pentos. She refuses until he calls her a whore, and {{declares}} that she cannot have his children. Joffrey is poisoned to death at his wedding feast, and Cersei immediately accuses Tyrion. At his trial, Shae appears to testify against him, falsely claiming that Sansa refused to bed Tyrion unless he killed Joffrey. Outraged at her betrayal and finally snapping from years of mockery for his <b>dwarfism,</b> Tyrion demands a trial by combat. Cersei names the virtually undefeatable Gregor Clegane as her champion. Tyrion is defended by Oberyn Martell, who believes that his sister, niece, and nephew were murdered by Gregor. Oberyn is nearly victorious, but his refusal to kill Gregor without obtaining a confession gives Gregor the opportunity to kill him, and Tyrion is sentenced to death. Before his execution, Tyrion is released by Jaime to be smuggled out of Westeros by Varys. Tyrion decides to confront Tywin before his flight, and finds Shae in his father's bed. Tyrion strangles her to death, and then confronts Tywin on the privy. Tyrion kills his father with a crossbow bolt, and then leaves for Pentos with Varys.|$|E
5|$|Wolves in Japan became extinct {{during the}} Meiji {{restoration}} period, an extermination known as ōkami no kujo. The wolf was deemed {{a threat to}} ranching, which the Meiji government promoted at the time, and targeted via a bounty system and a direct chemical extermination campaign inspired by the similar contemporary American campaign. The last Japanese wolf was a male killed on January 23, 1905 near Washikaguchi (now called Higashi Yoshiro). The now extinct Japanese wolves were descended from large Siberian wolves, which colonized the Korean Peninsula and Japan, before it separated from mainland Asia, 20,000 years ago during the Pleistocene. During the Holocene, the Tsugaru Strait widened and isolated Honshu from Hokkaidō, thus causing climatic changes leading to the extinction of most large bodied ungulates inhabiting the archipelago. Japanese wolves likely underwent a process of island <b>dwarfism</b> 7,000–13,000 years ago {{in response to these}} climatological and ecological pressures. C. l. hattai (formerly native to Hokkaidō) was significantly larger than its southern cousin C. l. hodophilax, as it inhabited higher elevations and had access to larger prey, as well as a continuing genetic interaction with dispersing wolves from Siberia.|$|E
25|$|Johnny Roventini, {{also known}} as John Louis Roventini and popularly as Johnny Philip Morris, (August 15, 1910– November 30, 1998) was an American actor with <b>dwarfism.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Jak-STAT pathway is {{instrumental}} {{in the development of}} limbs, specifically in its ability to regulate bone growth through paracrine signaling of cytokines. However, mutations in this pathway have been implicated in severe forms of dwarfism: thanatophoric dysplasia (lethal) and achondroplasic <b>dwarfism</b> (viable). This is due to a mutation in a Fgf gene, causing a premature and constitutive activation of the Stat1 transcription factor. Chondrocyte cell division is prematurely terminated, resulting in lethal <b>dwarfism.</b> Rib and limb bone growth plate cells are not transcribed. Thus, the inability of the rib cage to expand prevents the newborn's breathing.|$|E
25|$|Vizslas {{can also}} suffer from hypothyroidism, <b>dwarfism,</b> {{persistent}} right aortic arch, tricuspid valve dysplasia, and progressive retinal atrophy. Major risks include epilepsy and lymphosarcoma. Vizslas {{can also be}} prone to skin and food allergies.|$|E
25|$|Achondroplasia is {{a common}} cause of <b>dwarfism.</b> It occurs as a {{sporadic}} mutation in about 80% of cases (associated with advanced paternal age) {{or it may be}} inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic disorder.|$|E
25|$|Europasaurus is a basal macronarian sauropod, {{a form of}} quadrupedal herbivorous dinosaur. It lived {{during the}} Late Jurassic (middle Kimmeridgian, about 154 million years ago) of {{northern}} Germany, and {{has been identified as}} an example of insular <b>dwarfism</b> resulting from the isolation of a sauropod population on an island within the Lower Saxony basin.|$|E
25|$|In 1915 Alfredo Boloña Jimenez {{formed a}} son group in Havana. He played the marimbula, the bongó and the guitar at {{different}} times and, despite his physical limitations (<b>dwarfism),</b> he was a force in Cuban music for half a century. His first group was Hortensia Valerón (vocalist), Manuel Menocal (tres), Manuel Corona (guitar), Victoriano Lopéz (maracas) and Joaquín Velasquéz (bongó).|$|E
25|$|It is {{a lethal}} rhizomelic (malformations which result in short, {{underdeveloped}} limbs) form of <b>dwarfism,</b> exhibiting both skeletal dysplasia (malformations of bone) and fibroblastic dysplasia (abnormal development of fibroblasts, specialized cells {{that make up}} fibrous connective tissue, which {{plays a role in}} the formation of cellular structure and promotes healing of damaged tissues). Death caused by complications of fibrochondrogenesis occurs in infancy.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the high}} number of MAPK genes, MAPK {{pathways}} of higher plants were studied less than animal or fungal ones. Although their signaling appears very complex, the MPK3, MPK4 and MPK6 kinases of Arabidopsis thaliana are key mediators of responses to osmotic shock, oxidative stress, response to cold and involved in anti-pathogen responses. In addition, they are also involved in morphogenesis, since MPK4 mutants display severe <b>dwarfism.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2008 Australian {{researchers}} Peter J. Obendorf, Charles E. Oxnard, and Ben J. Kefford {{suggested that}} LB1 and LB6 suffered from myxoedematous (ME) endemic cretinism resulting from congenital hypothyroidism {{and that they}} were part of an affected population of H.sapiens on the island. This disease, caused by various environmental factors including iodine deficiency, is a form of <b>dwarfism</b> which can still be found among the local Indonesian population.|$|E
25|$|Robinow {{syndrome}} {{is an extremely}} rare genetic disorder characterized by short-limbed <b>dwarfism,</b> abnormalities in the head, face, and external genitalia, as well as vertebral segmentation. The disorder was first described in 1969 by human geneticist Meinhard Robinow, along with physicians Frederic N. Silverman and Hugo D. Smith, in the American Journal of Diseases of Children. By 2002, over 100 cases had been documented and introduced into medical literature.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{three percent}} of PGD clinics in the US {{reported}} having selected an embryo {{for the presence of}} a disability. Couples involved were accused of purposely harming a child. This practice is notable in <b>dwarfism,</b> where parents intentionally create a child who is a dwarf. In the selection of a saviour sibling to provide a matching bone marrow transplant for an already existing affected child, there are issues including the commodification and welfare of the donor child.|$|E
25|$|Deletion of the Trsp gene in osteochondroprogenitor cells {{results in}} {{abnormal}} bone growth, delayed ossification, chondronecrosis and <b>dwarfism.</b> General Trsp gene deletion is lethal to the embryo. The {{results of this}} research was used as a model for Kashin-Beck disease. Kashin-Beck is a result of combinatorial environmentally induced by factors such as: toxic mould, contaminated grains by mycotoxins, and mostly by selenium deficiency, which is necessary for selenoprotein function. The disease has symptoms similar to those resulting from Trsp gene knockout.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{suffer from}} <b>dwarfism,</b> short lower arms, small feet, and small hands. Fingers and toes {{may also be}} {{abnormally}} short and laterally or medially bent. The thumb may be displaced and some patients, notably in Turkey, experience ectrodactyly. All patients often suffer from vertebral segmentation abnormalities. Those with the dominant variant have, at most, a single butterfly vertebra. Those with the recessive form, however, may suffer from hemivertebrae, vertebral fusion, and rib anomalies. Some cases resemble Jarcho-Levin syndrome or spondylocostal dysostosis.|$|E
25|$|The typical {{depiction}} of a dwarf in Egyptian art is realistic, showing a normally grown torso and head, but visibly shortened and slightly bent arms and legs. These proportions point to achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia as the conditions responsible for the <b>dwarfism</b> of the individual. Yet, there are also reliefs of small peoples with normal body proportions and it remains unclear if these representations show real pygmies or if these people are represented small in order to reflect their low rank or accentuate the main scene of the relief.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of rare {{diseases}} which resemble GH deficiency, including the childhood growth failure, facial appearance, delayed bone age, and low IGF levels. However, GH testing elicits normal or high levels of GH in the blood, demonstrating that the problem is not due to a deficiency of GH but rather to a reduced sensitivity to its action. Insensitivity to GH is traditionally termed Laron <b>dwarfism,</b> but over the last 15 years many different types of GH resistance have been identified, primarily involving mutations of the GH binding protein or receptors.|$|E
25|$|Endocrine {{abnormalities}} {{in other}} areas have also been present with the disorder. These include hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency and hypopituitarism. Findings affecting pituitary function in some JBS patients have included such anomalies as {{the formation of a}} glial hamartoma (a neoplasm, or tumor composed of glial cells) on a lobe of the pituitary gland, as well congenital underdevelopment of the anterior pituitary. Growth failure and associated short stature (<b>dwarfism)</b> in JBS can be attributed to growth hormone deficiency caused by diminished anterior pituitary function, with malabsorption of fats playing a subsequent role.|$|E
25|$|Unconditional Love was not {{released}} until 2002. Her performance {{was seen by}} Paul Haggis, who created the role of Emily Resnick for her on Family Law. Joining the cast in 2002, she continued with the series until its cancellation later that same year. She later had significant guest appearances on NYPD Blue, Dharma & Greg, , House and NCIS. She also appeared as herself in Standing Tall at Auschwitz, which was a History Channel documentary on the Ovitz family, and in No Bigger Than a Minute, an independent documentary on <b>dwarfism</b> which aired on the PBS program P.O.V.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{symptoms}} generally include coarse or rough {{facial features}} (including a flat nasal bridge, thick lips, and enlarged mouth and tongue), short stature with disproportionately short trunk (<b>dwarfism),</b> dysplasia (abnormal bone size and/or shape) and other skeletal irregularities, thickened skin, enlarged organs such as liver (hepatomegaly) or spleen (splenomegaly), hernias, and excessive body hair growth. Short and often claw-like hands, progressive joint stiffness, and {{carpal tunnel syndrome}} can restrict hand mobility and function. Recurring respiratory infections are common, as are obstructive airway disease and obstructive sleep apnea. Many affected individuals also have heart disease, often involving enlarged or diseased heart valves.|$|E
25|$|Dubreuillosaurus is a genus of {{carnivorous}} dinosaur {{from the}} middle Jurassic Period. It is a megalosaurid theropod. Its fossils were found in France. The only named species, Dubreuillosaurus valesdunensis, was originally described as a species of Poekilopleuron, Poekilopleuron? valesdunensis, which is still formally the type species of the genus. It was later renamed Dubreuillosaurus valesdunensis when, in 2005, Allain {{came to the conclusion}} that it was not part of the genus Poekilopleuron. Its type specimen, MNHN 1998-13, is only rivalled in the number of preserved elements in this group by that of Eustreptospondylus. Dubreuillosaurus is considered to be the sister species of Magnosaurus. It did not show signs of insular <b>dwarfism</b> even though it was uncovered on an island.|$|E
25|$|Achondroplasia {{is caused}} by a {{mutation}} in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). In normal development FGFR3 has a negative regulatory effect on bone growth. In achondroplasia, the mutated form of the receptor is constitutively active and this leads to severely shortened bones. The effect is genetically dominant, with one mutant copy of the FGFR3 gene being sufficient to cause achondroplasia, while two copies of the mutant gene are invariably fatal (recessive lethal) before or shortly after birth (known as a lethal allele). A person with achondroplasia thus has a 50% chance of passing <b>dwarfism</b> to each of their offspring. People with achondroplasia can be born to parents that do not have the condition due to spontaneous mutation.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} report further claims neither {{growth retardation}} nor pituitary <b>dwarfism</b> could {{be responsible for}} the unique skull and short stature (however, no reason is provided); instead, Brown et al. suggest insular dwarfing of H. erectus as a result of selective pressures acting on island populations. This theory posits that the tropical rainforests present on the island tend to be a calorically impoverished environment, causing a dietary strain on hominins, especially in the absence of agriculture. Because of reduced resources, an advantage is placed on individuals who are smaller with lower energy requirements. This selection can also greatly affect sensory organs such as the brain, which could explain the small endocranial volume present in H. floresiensis.|$|E
25|$|To {{explain the}} small stature of H.nbsp&floresiensis, Brown et al. have {{suggested}} that in the limited food environment on Flores, H.nbsp&erectus evolved a smaller body size via insular <b>dwarfism,</b> a form of speciation which has been observed in other species on Flores alsonbsp&– including several species of the proboscidean genus Stegodon, an elephant-like creature. (A dwarf stegodont species of Flores, Stegodon sondaari, became extinct by about 850,000 years ago {{and was replaced by}} another species of normal size, Stegodon florensis, which then also evolved into a dwarf form, Stegodon florensis insularis, which disappeared about 12,000 years ago.) This hypothesis has been criticized by Teuku Jacob and colleagues who argue that LB1 is similar to the pygmy peoples who populate a Flores village, Rampasasa,nbsp&– and who point out that size can vary substantially in pygmy populations. Contradictory evidence has emerged.|$|E
