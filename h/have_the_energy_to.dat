60|$|Courts and {{camps are}} always the scenes of {{conspiracy}} and treason, and Alexander was continually hearing of conspiracies and plots formed against him.

50|$|During retirement, he {{continued}} to remain active particularly in areas relating {{to the welfare of}} soldiers and their widows, as well as historical aspects of The Parachute Regiment, especially in respect of monuments in Normandy, France.

50|$|A common pious {{practice}} sometimes alternates Mary Salome with Jacob, due to {{a popular}} belief that Salome, an elderly person at this time would not <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> reach <b>the</b> tomb of Christ at the morning of resurrection, though she {{was present at the}} Crucifixion. To date, this remains to be a geographical tradition that varies from one town to another. Another practice pertains to Mary Magdalene is sometimes referred to Mary of Bethany being the same person, in line with the long-standing tradition in Western Christianity that identified Mary Magdalene (probably from Magdala near Lake Tiberias) with Mary of Bethany, a place near Jerusalem, much further south.|$|R
6000|$|The reason, indeed, is very simple. A man {{cannot be}} {{wise enough to}} be a great artist without being wise enough to wish to be a philosopher. A man cannot <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> produce good art without having the energy to wish to pass beyond it. A small artist is content with art; a great artist is content with nothing except everything. So we find that when real forces, good or bad, like Kipling and G. B. S., enter our arena, they bring with them not only startling and arresting art, but very startling and arresting dogmas. And they care even more, and desire us to care even more, about their startling and arresting dogmas than about their startling and arresting art. Mr. Shaw is a good dramatist, but what he desires more than {{anything}} else to be is a good politician. Mr. Rudyard Kipling is by divine caprice and natural genius an unconventional poet; but what he desires more than anything else to be is a conventional poet. He desires to be the poet of his people, bone of their bone, and flesh of their flesh, understanding their origins, celebrating their destiny. He desires to be Poet Laureate, a most sensible and honourable and public-spirited desire. Having been given by the gods originality--that is, disagreement with others--he desires divinely to agree with them. But the most striking instance of all, more striking, I think, even than either of these, is the instance of Mr. H. G. Wells. He began in a sort of insane infancy of pure art. He began by making a new heaven and a new earth, with the same irresponsible instinct by which men buy a new necktie or button-hole. He began by trifling with the stars and systems in order to make ephemeral anecdotes; he killed the universe for a joke. He has since become more and more serious, and has become, as men inevitably do when they become more and more serious, more and more parochial. He was frivolous about the twilight of the gods; but he is serious about the London omnibus. He was careless in [...] "The Time Machine," [...] for that dealt only with the destiny of all things; but he is careful, and even cautious, in [...] "Mankind in the Making," [...] for that deals with the day after to-morrow. He began {{with the end of the}} world, and that was easy. Now he has gone on to the beginning of the world, and that is difficult. But the main result of all this is the same as in the other cases. The men who have really been the bold artists, the realistic artists, the uncompromising artists, are the men who have turned out, after all, to be writing [...] "with a purpose." [...] Suppose that any cool and cynical art-critic, any art-critic fully impressed with the conviction that artists were greatest when they were most purely artistic, suppose that a man who professed ably a humane aestheticism, as did Mr. Max Beerbohm, or a cruel aestheticism, as did Mr. W. E. Henley, had cast his eye over the whole fictional literature which was recent in the year 1895, and had been asked to select the three most vigorous and promising and original artists and artistic works, he would, I think, most certainly have said that for a fine artistic audacity, for a real artistic delicacy, or for a whiff of true novelty in art, the things that stood first were [...] "Soldiers Three," [...] by a Mr. Rudyard Kipling; [...] "Arms and the Man," [...] by a Mr. Bernard Shaw; and [...] "The Time Machine," [...] by a man called Wells. And all these men have shown themselves ingrainedly didactic. You may express the matter if you will by saying that if we want doctrines we go to the great artists. But it is clear from the psychology of the matter that this is not the true statement; the true statement is that when we want any art tolerably brisk and bold we have to go to the doctrinaires.|$|E

John Stewart rose to a new level of awareness and became the first mortal Guardian of the Universe.
