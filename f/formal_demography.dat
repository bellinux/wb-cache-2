40|$|This {{dissertation}} first {{identifies the}} household cycle {{as the core}} concept in <b>formal</b> household <b>demography,</b> and presents a simple model of the determinants of the size distribution and the average size of the household. In this model, the proximate processes which govern the end points of the household cycle are fission, fusion, and fission-fusion of households and the joint mortality of household members. The growth of the household during its cycle is, on the other hand, influenced by events occurring to individual household members given that the household is viable. Analytical models then can be developed {{for the study of}} the household using the concept of the household cycle as the unit of analysis.;From the perspective of the household cycle, then, Ryder 2 ̆ 7 s model of the average size of the household cycle is first formalized, and then extended to two cases: the extended family household with and without a foster mother. Expressions of average household size are determined in terms of various demographic parameters such as the gross level of fertility, parental survival, and the net reproduction rate. Illustrative results are provided for three hypothetical societies described in the classical theory of demographic transition.;In addition, a microsimulation model of Canadian household cycles is developed in order to examine the sensitivity of average household size to different demographic parameters associated with the formation, growth, and extinction of households. An interesting and counterintuitive finding of this research is that the overall influence of mortality would depend on the net outcome of the two contradictory effects at the two levels of analysis [...] the household and the individual. Fertility increase necessarily leads to an increase in the average size of the household, keeping other factors constant. Nuclear family household formation, the last component in the simulation model, on the other hand, checks the growth of households and lowers the average size of the household.;It is finally suggested that more varieties of household organization could be modeled using the analytical approaches developed in this Dissertation One could also use the microsimulation model to study the demographic component of the size distribution of households...|$|R

OBJECTIVE We want to deepen understanding of how compositional change affects population averages. RESULTS The difference between two averages of a variable, calculated using alternative weighting functions, equals the covariance between the variable and {{the ratio of the}} weighting functions, divided by the average of the ratio. We compare weighted and unweighted averages and also provide examples of use of the relationship in analyses of fertility and mortality.

40|$|We {{present and}} prove {{a formula for}} decomposing change in a {{population}} average into two components. One component captures the effect of direct change in the characteristic of interest, and the other captures the effect of compositional change. The decomposition is applied to time derivatives of averages over age and over subpopulations. Examples include decomposition of the change over time in the average age at childbearing and in the general fertility rate for China, Denmark and Mexico. A decomposition of the change over time in the crude death rate in Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands is also presented.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the existence of}} tempo effects in mortality and evaluates the procedure developed by Bongaarts and Feeney for calculating a tempo-adjusted life expectancy. It is shown that Bongaarts and Feeney's index {{can be interpreted as}} an indicator reflecting current mortality conditions under specific assumptions regarding the effects of changing period mortality conditions on the timing of future cohort deaths. It is argued, however, that currently there is no clear evidence about the existence of such effects in actual populations. This paper concludes that until the existence of these effects can be demonstrated, it is preferable to continue using the conventional life expectancy as an indicator of current mortality conditions. demographic methods, <b>formal</b> <b>demography,</b> measurement issues, mortality models, tempo adjustments, tempo effects...|$|E

Closed form solutions for the equations governing dynamic multistate models are not always possible, but are presented for certain special cases.

Simplicity is a virtue in making projections, allowing sensitivity tests of assumptions and avoiding the misleading impression of precision associated with more complicated methods.

40|$|Religion {{has survived}} {{a period of}} {{comparative}} neglect in social science to become a topic of keen interest. Questions on religion are now often included in censuses and surveys. It does not follow from the perceived importance of the topic, however, that these questions yield useful data. The difficulties and limitations of using survey responses on religion, and the purposes that such information might nevertheless serve, are examined in this paper. The effects of religion may relate either to religious identity or {{to the degree of}} religious commitment (religiosity). Neither of these characteristics is easy to measure. The potential importance of religion means that demand for data on the topic is unlikely to disappear, however. Religion can affect age at marriage, marital stability, attitudes to family planning and desired family size, health and morbidity, and propensity to move, that is, fertility, mortality, and migration, the main topics of <b>formal</b> <b>demography.</b> It can also be relevant in various areas of applied population studies, including education, economic activity, social equality, crime, alcohol use, social attitudes, and social capital, making it a factor in public-policy debates. ...|$|E
40|$|Background. <b>Formal</b> <b>demography</b> has a {{long history}} of {{building}} simple models of age schedules of demographic quantities, e. g. mortality and fertility rates. These are widely used in demographic methods to manipulate whole age schedules using few parameters. Objective. The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) factorizes a matrix into three matrices with useful properties including the ability to reconstruct the original matrix using many fewer, simple matrices. This work demonstrates how these properties can be exploited to build parsimonious models of whole age schedules of demographic quantities that can be further parameterized in terms of arbitrary covariates. Methods. The SVD is presented and explained in detail with attention to developing an intuitive understanding. The SVD is used to construct a general, component model of demographic age schedules, and that model is demonstrated with age-specific mortality and fertility rates. Finally, the model is used (1) to predict age-specific mortality using HIV indicators and summary measures of age-specific mortality, and (2) to predict age-specific fertility using the total fertility rate (TFR) ...|$|E
40|$|Although {{there is}} general {{consensus}} that growth in the prison population should be reversed, there is little agreement on how to achieve this goal. In this paper, I apply classic demographic methods to answer questions that assess the strategies, complexities, and realities of routes to zero and negative prison population growth. Modified admissions policies have had {{the greatest impact on}} halting growth, whereas decreasing the length of sentences has had only a modest, short-term influence on the prison population size. As state and federal policy-makers consider reducing sentences for selective classes of nonviolent offenders, it is important that they have a holistic understanding of the implications of such policies. Traditionally, this type of modification has been coupled with more punitive policies for violent offenders, a pattern that reinforces the appearance of having “tough on crime” policies. Model estimates show that such strategies countervail the overall goal of decreasing the size of the prison population. Regardless of underlying reasons to halt growth of the prison populations, integration of the <b>formal</b> <b>demography</b> enable a means to assess the short- and long-term consequences of current and future policy...|$|E
40|$|Industrial {{dynamics}} {{is increasingly}} studied from a demographic perspective. Demography of firms {{is one of}} the research methods to describe and analyse the evolution of industries. Although this is a very useful and promising interdisciplinary field of study, {{there are a number of}} conceptual problems when dealing with the <b>formal</b> <b>demography</b> of firms, and especially in the demographic component of firm start-ups. Fertility or parenthood is not clearly defined here, and occurrence-exposure rates or probabilities of giving birth to a firm are difficult to define. An alternative way of looking at the process of firm start-ups is to view the process as essentially driven by decisions of entrepreneurs within a labour market setting. A worker may decide to be an employee, to be self-employed or an entrepreneur. Although there is not a one-to-one correspondence between entrepreneurs and enterprises, the behaviour of more than 90 percent of firms can be studied from an individual entrepreneurial point of view. There is a large methodological advantage when taking the labour market point of view. Standard demographic tools may be used for describing, analysing and even conditional forecasting of the process. This paper shows how multidimensional demographic models may be used in describing and analysing the process of firm start-ups from an entrepreneurial perspective. ...|$|E
40|$|The core aim of {{this book}} is to {{determine}} how anthropology and demography {{can be used in}} conjunction in the field of population and development. The boundaries of demography are not as clearly defined or as stable as one might think, especially in view of the tension between a <b>formal</b> <b>demography</b> centered on the 'core of procedures and references' and a more open form of demography, generally referred to as Population Studies. Many rapprochements, missed opportunities and isolated attempts marked the disci- plinary history of anthropology and demography, both disciplines being founded on distinct and highly differentiated traditions and practices. Moreover, the role and the place assigned to epistemology differ significantly in ethnology and demography. Yet, 1 anthropology and demography provide complementary models and research instru- ments and this book shows that neither discipline can afford to overlook their respec- tive contributions. Based on research conducted in West Africa over more than twenty years, it is a defense of field demography that makes case for a continuum ranging from the initial concep- tion of fieldwork and research to its effective implementation and to data analysis. Changes in behaviors relating to fertility, poverty or migration cannot be interpreted without invoking the cultural factor at some stage. Representations in their collective and individual dimensions also fit into the extended explanatory space of demography...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{dedicated}} to the 50 th anniversary of the Stanovništvo (Population) journal, launched by the Center for demographic research in Belgrade in 1963. The anniversary is an opportunity to reflect on developments and trends in demography as a discipline, thus the paper points out certain specifics of these developments. The specifics discussed mirror the author's choice, which was guided primarily by the criterion of interestingness, but also by the intention to make a survey. Hence points about the development of demography are backed by insights made by a number of other demographers. The major source of references were papers and speeches given on similar occasions - anniversaries of journals, anniversaries of associations of demographers, as well as special issues of journals dedicated to theory and methodology. Certain points are also made based on other sources of reference. The major part of the paper is related to transformations of demography, which has started as a predominantly formal discipline and has developed into a social and interdisciplinary field. Topical and methodological expansion of demography induces mixed reactions among demographers. Ones welcome its diversification, whereas others see such changes as signs of abandoning the essence of demography. This makes it harder and harder to define the area of demographic research. Changes in demography are mostly studied from the standpoint of polarized dimensions: quantitative-qualitative, macro-micro, and, in the context of diversification, <b>formal</b> <b>demography</b> vs. population studies. Another important segment of development trends in demography is that of improving its vocabulary, which is affected by other fields related to demography. Terminological changes are also related to the specification of certain branches and subfields of demography. For instance, anthropological and spatial demography have roots in earlier development phases of demography. Still, these terms have become popular at a later stage, only when the methodological and cognitive capacities of the corresponding research approaches have increased. The paper also indicates that demographers do not find new inspiration only outside of the core demographic problems. As an example, man fertility is briefly discussed as an increasingly popular topic in literature during the last decade. Finally, attractive presentation of demographic content is found to be very important for visibility and applicability of demography, which is illustrated by interpreting some of the most frequently videos related to demography on YouTube. The paper concludes that different paths that open during the development of demography are not incompatible, that they represent demographers' diverse choices, and that they all contribute to strengthening the field.

40|$|Population {{geography}} is a subdiscipline of Human geography and studies the distribution, concentration and {{density of population}} over the terestrial surface, as well as differences in population size, changes and characteristics, like structures, migrations, activity etc, among some places present compared to others. Population geography has had a perscientific stage as long as human history. First modern scientific treatis of population in geography was the F. Ratzels book Antropogeography in 1882. During {{the first half of}} the XX century, French geographer Vidal de la Blanche gave a capital importance of population studies in his work Principes de Geographie Humaine. In interwar years, various aspects of population were studied. After The Second World War started the renovating movement of geography and new tendencies appear in human geography and, consequently in population geography. Attempts were made to define population geography as a separate sub-discipline. The world wide trend of treating population geography as separate discipline was expressed by publishing monographs, bibliographies and textbooks. The most significant authors who worked on defining population geography were French geographers P. George (1951, 1959), Beaujen-Garnier (1965, 1966); North-american geographers: G. Trewarta (1953, 1969), W. Bunge (1962), J. Clance (1965, 1971), W. Zelinski (1966); in Great Britain: J. I. Clarke (1965); in USSR: Ju. G. Sauškin i D. N. Anučin (1950), V. V. Pokšiševskij (1966), D. I. Valentej (1973); in Poland V. Ormotski (1931), L. Kosinski (1967) A. Jagelski (1980). Those authors and their works had the significant influence on the development of population science in the world and also in Serbia. Although the development of population geography was different in different countries and scientific research centers, we can clearly defined four stages. First stage lasted untill 1960 s and was characterised by works of G. Trewarta, H. Doerres Ju. G. Sauškin, D. N. Anučin, J. Beaujeu-Gariner. G. Trewarta argued that the population is the point of reference from which all other elements are observed and from which all derive significance and meaning. This view was adopted and shared by authors dealing with population items, explicitly or implicitly. Second stage lasted from 1960 s till 1970 s and the most significant authors dealing with population problems were W. Zelinsky, W. Bunge; H. Bobek, W. Hartke, K. Ruppert, F. Schaffer; D. I. Valentej, K. Korčak. This phase was characterized by the application of quantitative methods and efforts for understanding the spatial structure of the population. Many scientists see this development phase as a particularly prosperous period, because it carried more intensive relations of geography and demography through the introduction of statistical, mathematical and demographic methods and techniques in studies of population geography. Third phase lasted from 1970 s to 1980 s, and was characterized by close relations between population geography and <b>formal</b> <b>demography.</b> Development and application of GIS and computer data, have made population studies more complex and applicable in practice, through population policy and population projections. The most significant authors in this period were L. Kosinski, A. Jagelski, Hägerstrand. And at last, fourth stage started in 1980 s and in many countries lastes untill present days. In population geography appeared new tendencies associated with the critique of positivism, the establishment of humanistic approaches and modifications of general geographic concepts. In this period, spatial analysis and quantitative scientific methods were reaffirmed, and because of that some population studies were redefined in spatial demography, a time dimension advocated in historical demography. In this context, we emphasize the work of D. Plane and P. Rogerson. Population {{geography is}} viewed differently from one country to another. Its definition differs from too narrow to overly broad. But two research areas were of particular interest to geographers - population distribution and migration. Both items acquired an international dimension. Recently, eminent population geographers exchanged various view points in an attempt to provoke new thinking on subject and define the answers of new fields research in population geography. Population geography in the XXI Century is no longer a field comprised of spatial applications of fertility, mortality and migration only. Contemporary population geography is theoretically sophisticated, integrating spatial analysis, GIS and geo-referenced data. Future progress in the field of population geography will derive from more research at the intersections of population processes and societal issues and concerns. Major themes of future empirical researches in population geography should be: global population growth, studies of migration, transnationalism, human security issues, population-health-environment nexus, human-environment sustainability, economic development and poverty issues.
