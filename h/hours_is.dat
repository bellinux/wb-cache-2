5|$|Fluorine-18 {{is often}} found in {{radioactive}} tracers for positron emission tomography, as its half-life of almost two <b>hours</b> <b>is</b> long enough to allow for its transport from production facilities to imaging centers. The most common tracer is fluorodeoxyglucose which, after intravenous injection, is taken up by glucose-requiring tissues such as the brain and most malignant tumors; computer-assisted tomography can then be used for detailed imaging.|$|E

5|$|Adderall is {{available}} as immediate-release tablets or two different extended-release formulations. The extended-release capsules are generally {{used in the}} morning. A shorter, 12-hour extended-release formulation {{is available}} under the brand Adderall XR and {{is designed to provide}} a therapeutic effect and plasma concentrations identical to taking two doses 4hours apart. The longer extended-release formulation, approved for 16 <b>hours,</b> <b>is</b> available under the brand Mydayis. In the United States, the immediate and extended release (XR) formulations of Adderall are both available as generic drugs, while Mydayis is available only as a brand-name drug.|$|E
5|$|Each police {{district}} may dictate that operational personnel {{have a higher}} amount of training, for instance 80 <b>hours</b> <b>is</b> required in Oslo. Officers are certified at five levels, of which the top four can use firearms. Level three consists of a call-out unit for each {{police district}}, consisting of a combined 646 people. This requires 103 hours of special training per year. Higher levels are required for body-guard service (55 officers) and the Emergency Response Union (73 officers). All certification curriculum is developed by and organized by the university college.|$|E

5|$|The {{forecasting}} of the precipitation {{within the}} next six <b>hours</b> <b>is</b> {{often referred to as}} nowcasting. In this time range it is possible to forecast smaller features such as individual showers and thunderstorms with reasonable accuracy, as well as other features too small to be resolved by a computer model. A human given the latest radar, satellite and observational data {{will be able to make}} a better analysis of the small scale features present and so will be able to make a more accurate forecast for the following few hours. However, there is now expert systems using those data and mesoscale numerical model to make better extrapolation, including evolution of those features in time.|$|E
5|$|Transport between islands is {{primarily}} by ferry, and Shetland Islands Council operates various inter-island services. Shetland is also {{served by a}} domestic connection from Lerwick to Aberdeen on mainland Scotland. This service, which takes about 12 <b>hours,</b> <b>is</b> operated by NorthLink Ferries. Some services also call at Kirkwall, Orkney, which increases the journey time between Aberdeen and Lerwick by 2 hours. There are plans for road tunnels {{to some of the}} islands, especially Bressay and Whalsay, however it is hard to convince the mainland government to finance them.|$|E
5|$|Hydroquinone lightens {{the skin}} when applied topically by {{inhibiting}} tyrosinase, the enzyme responsible for converting the amino acid tyrosine {{to the skin}} pigment melanin, and is used to treat acne-associated postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. By interfering with new production of melanin in the epidermis, hydroquinone leads to less hyperpigmentation as darkened skin cells are naturally shed over time. Improvement in skin hyperpigmentation is typically seen within six months when used twice daily. Hydroquinone is ineffective for hyperpigmentation affecting deeper layers of skin such as the dermis. The use of a sunscreen with SPF15 or higher {{in the morning with}} reapplication every two <b>hours</b> <b>is</b> recommended when using hydroquinone. Its application only to affected areas lowers the risk of lightening the color of normal skin but can lead to a temporary ring of lightened skin around the hyperpigmented area. Hydroquinone is generally well-tolerated; side effects are typically mild (e.g., skin irritation) and occur with use of a higher than the recommended 4% concentration. Most preparations contain the preservative sodium metabisulfite, which has been linked to rare cases of allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and severe asthma exacerbations in susceptible people. In extremely rare cases, repeated improper topical application of high-dose hydroquinone has been associated with an accumulation of homogentisic acid in connective tissues, a condition known as exogenous ochronosis.|$|E

5|$|In {{his next}} project, 127 Hours, {{directed}} by Danny Boyle, Franco portrayed real-life mountain climber Aron Ralston. It {{was given a}} limited release starting on November 5, 2010. 127 Hours centered on Ralston trying to free his hand after it became trapped under a boulder in a ravine while canyoneering alone in Utah and resorting to desperate measures in order to survive, eventually amputating his arm. During the five-week, 12-hours-per-day shoot, Franco would only leave the gully set to use the lavatory and would read books such as academic textbooks to keep busy. Franco later called making 127 Hours a {{once in a lifetime}} experience. To date, 127 <b>Hours</b> <b>is</b> one of his most well-reviewed movies and was also a commercial success, earning $60.7million against an $18million budget. His performance earned him universal acclaim from critics. Subsequently, he was nominated for an Academy Award, Golden Globe and SAG award, as well as winning an Independent Spirit Award.|$|E
