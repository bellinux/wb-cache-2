5|$|The Mendelian and biometrician {{models were}} {{eventually}} reconciled {{with the development}} of population genetics. A key step was the work of the British biologist and statistician Ronald Fisher. In a series of papers starting in 1918 and culminating in his 1930 book The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, Fisher showed that the continuous variation measured by the biometricians could be produced by the combined action of many discrete genes, and that natural selection could change gene frequencies in a population, resulting in evolution. In a series of papers beginning in 1924, another British geneticist, J. B. S. Haldane, applied statistical analysis to real-world examples of natural selection, such as the evolution of <b>industrial</b> <b>melanism</b> in peppered moths, and showed that natural selection worked at an even faster rate than Fisher assumed.|$|E
5|$|Some animals' colours and {{patterns}} resemble a particular natural background. This {{is an important}} component of camouflage in all environments. For instance, tree-dwelling parakeets are mainly green; woodcocks of the forest floor are brown and speckled; reedbed bitterns are streaked brown and buff; in each case the animal's coloration matches the hues of its habitat. Similarly, desert animals are almost all desert coloured in tones of sand, buff, ochre, and brownish grey, whether they are mammals like the gerbil or fennec fox, birds such as the desert lark or sandgrouse, or reptiles like the skink or horned viper.Military uniforms, too, generally resemble their backgrounds; for example khaki uniforms are a muddy or dusty colour, originally chosen for service in South Asia.Many moths show <b>industrial</b> <b>melanism,</b> including the peppered moth which has coloration that blends in with tree bark. The coloration of these insects evolved between 1860 and 1940 to match the changing colour of the tree trunks on which they rest, from pale and mottled to almost black in polluted areas. This is taken by zoologists as evidence that camouflage is influenced by natural selection, as well as demonstrating that it changes where necessary to resemble the local background.|$|E

5000|$|Henry Bernard Davis Kettlewell (24 February 1907 - 11 May 1979) was a British geneticist, lepidopterist {{and medical}} doctor, who {{performed}} {{research on the}} influence of <b>industrial</b> <b>melanism</b> on peppered moth (Biston betularia) colouration, showing why moths are darker in polluted areas.

5000|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>melanism</b> is an {{evolutionary}} effect in insects {{such as the}} peppered moth, Biston betularia in areas subject to industrial pollution. Darker pigmented individuals are favored by natural selection, apparently because they are better camouflaged against polluted backgrounds. When pollution was later reduced, lighter forms regained the advantage and melanism became less frequent. Other explanations have been proposed, such as that the melanin pigment contributes {{to the destruction of}} invaders through the immune defences of the dark-colored form of the organism. Another proposed mechanism {{is that there is a}} thermal advantage from the darker coloration.|$|E
5000|$|This {{is quite}} a small species with a {{wingspan}} of 22-30 mm. The forewings are white with dark grey cryptic markings, giving excellent camouflage against the lichens on which the eggs are laid. The intensity of the markings vary considerably, with darker individuals predominating in urban areas, an example of <b>industrial</b> <b>melanism.</b> A significant proportion of individuals also have orange or yellow markings. The hindwings are whitish with a broad grey band at the margin. The adults fly at night in July and August [...] and are attracted to light.|$|E
50|$|His {{grant was}} to study <b>industrial</b> <b>melanism</b> {{in general and}} in {{particular}} the peppered moth Biston betularia which had been studied by William Bateson during the 1890s. Kettlewell's research from three surveys between 1952 and 1972 seemed to show a static pattern with a high frequency of the dark-coloured carbonaria phenotype in industrial regions, and the light coloured typica moths the most common in more rural areas. In the first of Kettlewell's experiments moths were released into an aviary to observe how insectivorous birds reacted. He showed that the birds ate the moths, and found that if the camouflage of the moths made them difficult for him to see against a matching background, the birds too had difficulty in finding the moths. Most famously he then performed experiments involving releasing and then recapturing marked moths in polluted woodlands in Birmingham, and in unpolluted rural woods at Deanend Wood, Dorset, England. He demonstrated experimentally the efficiency of natural selection as an evolutionary force: light-coloured moths are more conspicuous than dark-coloured ones in industrial areas, where the vegetation is darkened by pollution, and are therefore easier prey for birds, but are less conspicuous in unpolluted rural areas, where the vegetation is lighter in colour, and therefore survive predation better. His experiment resulted in better understanding of <b>industrial</b> <b>melanism</b> and its effects on the evolution of species.|$|E
50|$|Kettlewell's {{experiment}} was a biological {{experiment in the}} mid-1950s to study the evolutionary mechanism of <b>industrial</b> <b>melanism</b> in the peppered moth (Biston betularia). It was executed by Bernard Kettlewell, who was working as research fellow in the Department of Zoology, University of Oxford. His aim {{was to investigate the}} scientific reason for the appearance of dark-coloured moth since Industrial Revolution in England in the 19th century. He conducted his first experiment in 1953 in the polluted woodland of Birmingham, and his second experiment in 1955 in Birmingham {{as well as in the}} clean woods of Dorset.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>melanism</b> is {{widespread}} in the Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), involving species such as Hamadryas feronia (variable cracker butterfly), Odontopera bidentata (scalloped hazel moth), Oligia latruncula (tawny marbled minor moth), Oligia strigilis (marbled minor moth), Lymantria monacha (dark arches), and many other species of moth; the most studied example is in the peppered moth, Biston betularia. It is also seen in a beetle, Adalia bipunctata (two-spot ladybird), where camouflage is not involved as the insect has conspicuous warning coloration. The rapid decline of melanism that has accompanied the reduction of pollution makes natural selection [...] "the only credible explanation". Camouflage against a darker background is the usual historical explanation.|$|E
5000|$|This is {{a fairly}} small species with a {{wingspan}} of 29-34 mm.
