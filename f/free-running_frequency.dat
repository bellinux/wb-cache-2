40|$|In {{order to}} model the {{synchronization}} of brain signals, a three-node fully-connected network is presented. The nodes {{are considered to be}} voltage control oscillator neurons (VCON) allowing to conjecture about how the whole process depends on synaptic gains, <b>free-running</b> <b>frequencies</b> and delays. The VCON, represented by phase-locked loops (PLL), are fully-connected and, as a consequence, an asymptotically stable synchronous state appears. Here, an expression for the synchronous state frequency is derived and the parameter dependence of its stability is discussed. Numerical simulations are performed providing conditions {{for the use of the}} derived formulae. Model differential equations are hard to be analytically treated, but some simplifying assumptions combined with simulations provide an alternative formulation for the long-term behavior of the fully-connected VCON network. Regarding this kind of network as models for brain frequency signal processing, with each PLL representing a neuron (VCON), conditions for their synchronization are proposed, considering the different bands of brain activity signals and relating them to synaptic gains, delays and <b>free-running</b> <b>frequencies.</b> For the delta waves, the synchronous state depends strongly on the delays.

50|$|It {{operates}} {{similarly to}} an injection locked oscillator. In an injection locked frequency divider, {{the frequency of}} the input signal is a multiple (or fraction) of the <b>free-running</b> <b>frequency</b> of the oscillator. While these frequency dividers tend to be lower power than broadband static (or flip-flop based) frequency dividers, the drawback is their low locking range. The ILFD locking range is inversely proportional to the quality factor (Q) of the oscillator tank. In integrated circuit designs, this makes an ILFD sensitive to process variations.

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis is on {{the application of the}} injection-locked oscillator technique to microwave balanced oscillators. The balanced oscillator design is primarily analysed using the extended resonance technique. A transmission line is connected between the two active devices, so that the active device resonate each other. The electrical length of the transmission line is also analysed for the balanced oscillation condition. The balanced oscillator can be viewed with the negative resistance model and the feedback model. The former model is characterised at a circuit plane where the feedback network is cut. By using both the negative-resistance oscillator model and the feedback model, the locking range of the oscillator is analysed by extending Kurokawa's theory. This analysis demonstrates the locking range of the injection phenomenon, where the injection frequency is either close to the <b>free-running</b> <b>frequency,</b> close to (1 /n) x <b>free-running</b> <b>frequency</b> or close to n x the <b>free-running</b> <b>frequency.</b> It also reveals the effect of different injection power levels on the locking range. Injection-locked balanced oscillators for subharmonic and fundamental modes are constructed. When the balanced oscillator is in the locking state, it is clearly shown that the output signal is better stabilised and the phase noise is attenuated. The experimental results agree with the analysis. Furthermore, the spurious signal suppression in a cascaded oscillator is investigated. The other focus of this research is on the design of frequency doublers. A balanced doubler is designed and integrated with a balanced injection-locked oscillator. The experimental result shows that the output signal is clean and stabilised. The other important frequency doubler design technique studied is the use of the feedforward technique to significantly eliminate the fundamental frequency component. The design and the experiment show that the fundamental component can be suppressed to bet...|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a normal {{form for the}} equation which describes nonlinear oscillations of spin-torque nano-oscillators (STNO). The general form of the equation might be reduced to the equation for STNO with uniformly magnetized free layer or to the equation for STNO with free layer in a magnetic vortex state. The equation is used to study the injection-locking problem. The bifurcation diagram for this problem is derived by using as bifurcation parameters the frequency and the amplitude of the ac excitation. Bifurcations lines corresponding to local bifurcations, i. e. the Saddle-node and the Hopf bifurcations, are derived by using linearization, while the lines corresponding to the Homoclinic bifurcation, which is global in nature, are derived numerically. The diagram exhibits universal features {{in terms of the}} shape and position of bifurcation lines. When the frequency of the ac excitation is relatively close to the <b>free-running</b> <b>frequency</b> of the oscillator the system is in synchronized state. For small ac amplitudes, the synchronization is lost for values of the ac frequency which imply the crossing of saddle-node bifurcations. For sufficiently larger values of the ac amplitude and for ac frequency smaller that the <b>free-running</b> <b>frequency,</b> the loss of the synchronized state occurs through a more complex bifurcation pattern which involves a sequence of two homoclinic bifurcations and an Hopf bifurcation.
