2500|$|On the French side, {{owing to}} the greater {{permeability}} to water, earth pressure balance TBMs with open and closed modes were used. The TBMs were of a closed nature during the initial , but then operated as open, boring through the chalk marl stratum. This minimised the impact to the ground, allowed high water pressures to be withstood and it also alleviated the need to grout ahead of the tunnel. The French effort required five TBMs: two main marine machines, one main land machine (the short land drives of [...] allowed one TBM to complete the first drive then reverse direction and complete the other), and two service tunnel machines. On the English side, the simpler geology allowed faster open-faced TBMs. Six machines were used, all commenced digging from Shakespeare Cliff, three marine-bound and three for the land tunnels. Towards {{the completion of the}} undersea drives, the UK TBMs were driven steeply downwards and buried clear of the tunnel.

For fibreglass and wooden hulls and HF transmission, the usual solution is to attach a sintered bronze plate to the outside of the hull for RF earthing. The construction of a sintered bronze plate is porous to water so that although the plate may be only a square foot or two and an inch thick, the actual surface area of metal in electrical contact with the water is very many times that.|$|E

40|$|A {{test section}} {{consisting}} of a circumferential array of conductance probes has been developed to measure the thickness distribution around the pipe wall of a liquid layer flowing in near horizontal pipes. When the film thickness is known, the array can be employed to measure the local film flow rate by injecting a high conductivity tracer into the liquid flowing at pipe wall. The test section consists of a short pipe made of a non-conducting material installed in a flow rig designed to operate at an appreciable pressure (40 bar). The flow loop is made of metallic pipes connected to the <b>electrical</b> <b>earth.</b> The conductance probes are made of three parallel, rigid wires spaced along the flow direction and are {{used to measure the}} height or the electrical conductivity of the liquid layer. The three-electrode geometry is aimed at minimizing current losses toward earth. The simultaneous operation of all the probes of the array, without multiplexing, allows a substantial reduction of current dispersion and a good circumferential resolution of film thickness or conductivity measurements. The probe geometry may generate an appreciable disturbance to the gas-liquid interface. This aspect of the proposed method has been studied with an experimental and numerical investigation relative to free falling liquid layers...|$|E
40|$|When {{creating}} an <b>electrical</b> <b>earth</b> for a transformer with vertically driven earthing rods, problems can arise either because {{the ground is}} too hard or because the ground is too resistive to achieve the required earthing resistance. To assist in the planning of earthing installations a geographic information system (GIS) layer has been created. In its simplest form it consists of a colour coded map that indicates the most likely earthing installation: a single vertically driven rod (indicated by dark green); multiple vertically driven rods (indicated by light green); a horizontal trench, where a rod installation is unlikely (indicated by yellow); for difficult ground, a specialist installation (i. e. drilling; indicated by red). However, the GIS can be interrogated to provide site-specific information such as site conditions, likely depth of installation and quantity of earthing materials required. The GIS was created from a spatial model constructed from soil, superficial and bedrock geology that has been attributed with engineering strength and resistivity values. Calculations of expected earthing rod resistance, rod or trench length, and all possible combinations of ground conditions have been compared with the ‚Äòlikely‚Äô conditions required {{for each of the}} four proposed installation scenarios to generate the GIS layer. The analysis has been applied to the electrical network distribution regions of Western Power Distribution, in the English Midlands, and UK Power Networks, which covers East Anglia, London and the SE of England. Because the spatial model that underlies the GIS has been constructed from national databases the analyses can be extended to other regions of the UK...|$|E
40|$|Carbon fibre {{reinforced}} polymers (CFRP) {{are increasingly}} used for structures on aircraft {{due to their}} superior mechanical properties compared to traditional materials, such as aluminium. Additionally, {{in order to improve}} aircraft performance, there is a continued trend for electrically driven loads on aircraft, increasing the on-board electrical power generation capacity and complexity of the electrical power system, including a desire to increase voltage levels and move towards DC distribution systems. Central to the reliable operation of an electrical power system is the development of an appropriate protection and fault management strategy. If an <b>electrical</b> <b>earth</b> fault occurs on a composite more-electric aircraft then the CFRP may form part of the route to ground. In order to develop an appropriate protection system and thus to understand the effects on engine generators it is necessary to investigate the fault response of this network. Hence a suitable electrical model of the CFRP material is required, which will enable CFRP to be included in a computationally-intensive systems-level simulation study of a more-electric aircraft (MEA) with fully switching power electronic converter models. This paper presents an experimentally validated impedance model of CFRP at an appropriate level of fidelity for use in systems level simulation platforms, enabling appropriate protection methods to be developed. The validated model considers the impact of the electrical bonding to ground, including the impedance added by a metallic frame that a CFRP panel may be mounted in. The simplicity of the model results in a less complex process to determine the expected impedance of the CFRP material, enabling a focus on the fault response of the system and subsequent development of appropriate protection solutions...|$|E

A precursor (104), e. g. hexamethyl disiloxane (HMDSO), is introduced into the chamber (102). The novel feature is connection of the substrate as the cathode of a magnetron plasma discharge (107), at least at intervals. The vacuum chamber forms the anode, or a separate anode (106) is included in the chamber, on the side to be coated. The substrate is connected to the <b>electrical</b> <b>earth</b> of the vacuum chamber. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An electrical screen surrounding the anode, is open towards the substrate. A metal sheet or stack of spaced metal sheets is located between substrate and screen, and parallel to the substrate. Screen, metal sheet and substrate are each separated by 1 - 10 mm spacing. The precursor feed is located in the volume enclosed by the screen and substrate. One electrode of a magnetron forms the anode for magnetron discharge. The substrate and electrode are the cathode or anode of the magnetron discharge, in alternation. A sputtering gas inlet is included. The vaporized material is connected as the anode of the magnetron discharge. The vaporizer is optionally an electron-beam vaporizer. Pulsed energy is supplied to the substrate. It is supplied with an alternating voltage. AN INDEPENDENT CLAIM IS INCLUDED FOR the corresponding method. USE - Apparatus for plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition. ADVANTAGE - Coatings are deposited on plates and continuous strips, using CVD processes. Even electrically-insulating layers are deposited with good long-term stability and uniform properties. A very high-intensity plasma is produced over the side to be coated, increasing the coating rate. Ionized material is predominantly positively-charged and is accelerated to the surface being coated. Dense, and where relevant, hard layers are produced. The cathode-anode voltage is 100 - 500 V.
