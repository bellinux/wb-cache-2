They pretend it's not {{important}} that our following among blacks, and young people, and urban communities is not what it should be... But I feel it's of the greatest importance that if there's to be a Republican Party, we look these <b>facts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face.|$|E
5|$|WHEN {{on board}} HMS Beagle, as naturalist, I was much struck with certain <b>facts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{distribution}} of the inhabitants of South America, and in the geological relations of the present to the past inhabitants of that continent. These facts {{seemed to me to}} throw some light on the origin of species—that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers.|$|E
5|$|A partial ouster or {{time limit}} clause {{specifies}} a restricted period, after which no remedy will be available. Such clauses are generally effective, unless the public authority has acted in bad faith. Similarly, {{the existence of}} bad faith entitles applicants to challenge decisions of authorities despite the existence of statutory provisions declaring such decisions to be conclusive evidence of certain <b>facts.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> absence of bad faith, the courts will enforce conclusive evidence clauses.|$|E

5|$|The {{courts in}} Singapore have {{followed}} the legal position on errors as to precedent <b>facts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom. This {{is illustrated by the}} High Court case Lau Seng Poh v. Controller of Immigration (1985), which held that if a precedent fact is a prerequisite to the exercise of executive power, the court is responsible for deciding if the precedent fact has been satisfied. This principle was affirmed by the Court of Appeal case Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), which applied the principle set out in Khawaja and its departure from the approach taken in Zamir.|$|E
5|$|In August, 1874, Ezra Abbot sent to Scrivener a letter: {{the rough}} draught of which covered forty odd pages, {{devoted to the}} {{correction}} of apparent errors and a statement of overlooked <b>facts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first edition of the Plain Introduction. The letter came too late {{to be used in}} preparing the body of the second edition of Scrivener's work. Abbot's studies largely argumented the number of suggestions, particularly in those portions of the book devoted to describing the extant manuscripts. They were accumulated in great part to the older and well-known authorities - such as Griesbach, Matthaei, Scholz (particularly his work Biblisch-kritische Reise, Leipzig 1823), Bianchini, Montfaucon, Silvestre, Bandini, Laubecius, and Zaeagni. Part of suggestions were a result of Abbott's studies of recent edited Catalogues of the ancient Greek Manuscripts held in the British Museum, Bodleian Library, Oxford Catalogues, Kitchin's Catalogue of the manuscripts in the Library of Christ Church College (Oxrofd, 1867). Abbott added numerous references to facsimile editions.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} jointly written by Kumar and David Brooks Miller. In order {{to present the}} correct {{technical}} and medical <b>facts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film, Kumar analysed documents of the court proceedings, forensic evidences and interviewed several survivors of the tragedy and also the staff members of the Union Carbide plant. Bhopal Group for Information and Action and many activists fighting {{for the rights of}} the victim of the disaster wanted to stop the film's screening, called it an insult to the victims, blamed the filmmakers of distorting the facts related to the disaster, diverting attention from Dow Chemical Company which acquired Union Carbide in 2001 and for portraying Anderson as a person who wanted to help the people but was unable to do so. Sheen denied these allegations and said that he did not sympathise for Anderson. Kumar also denied these allegations and said that the organisations had seen an older script. He added that making the film was a life-changing experience for him. A Prayer for Rain was added to the film's title because had it rained on the night of 2—3 December 1984, fewer people would have died.|$|E

25|$|United States v. Rock Royal Cooperative, Inc., – This {{was one of}} {{the first}} cases in which Reed wrote the {{majority}} opinion.

25|$|Pennekamp v. Florida, – Reed {{authored}} this {{majority opinion}} {{for a court}} which confronted {{the issue of whether}} judges could censor newspapers for impugning the reputation of the courts. The Miami Herald newspaper had published two editorials and a cartoon criticizing a Florida court's actions in a pending trial. The judge cited the publisher and editors for contempt, claiming that the published material maligned the integrity of the court and thereby interfered with the fair administration of justice. Hewing closely to the <b>facts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case, Reed used the clear and present danger test to come down firmly on the side of freedom of expression.|$|E
25|$|The record {{discloses}} {{that although}} the propanone was difficult to obtain, it {{was by no means}} impossible. The defendants admitted making the drug both before and after those batches made with the propanone supplied by Shapiro. Shapiro testified that he saw an empty bottle labeled phenyl-2-propanone on his first visit to the laboratory on December 7, 1969. And when the laboratory was searched pursuant to a search warrant on January 10, 1970, two additional bottles labeled phenyl-2-propanone were seized. Thus, the <b>facts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> record amply demonstrate that the propanone used in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine not only could have been obtained without the intervention of Shapiro but was in fact obtained by these defendants.|$|E
