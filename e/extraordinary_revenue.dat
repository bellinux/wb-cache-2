It is an expenditure rule with sets {{a limit on}} expenditure both during boom and during recession periods and applies to the federal budget and account.

There is a sanction mechanism present since deviations from the expenditure limit have to be corrected in the future.

The European State Finance Database (ESFD) is an international collaborative research project for the collection of data in European fiscal history. There are no strict geographical or chronological boundaries to the collection, although data for this collection comprise the period between c. 1200 to c. 1815. The purpose of the ESFD was to establish a significant database of European financial and fiscal records. The data are drawn from the main extant sources {{of a number of}} European countries, as the evidence and the state of scholarship permit. The aim was to collect the data made available by scholars, whether drawing upon their published or unpublished archival research, or from other published material. The ESFD project at the University of Leicester serves also to assist scholars working with the data by providing statistical manipulations of data and high quality graphical outputs for publication. The broad aim of the project was to act as a facilitator for a general methodological and statistical advance in the area of European fiscal history, with data capture and the interpretation of data in key publications as the measurable indicators of that advance.

40|$|The {{establishment}} of the Bourbon monarchy encountered one of its main hurdles in the critical situation of the royal treasury inherited from the reign of Charles II, {{with most of the}} assets engaged in the payment of public debt. One further obstacle was the start of the War of Succession, which brought about, on the one hand, a reduction in the treasury income and, on the other, a considerable increase in expenses intended to fund the creation of a large new army. To cope with such a situation, the monarchy had to resort to multiple extraordinary resources. This article deals with two of these resources: the income obtained from the sale of positions and honours, and an exceptional loan provided by the clergy in the spring of 1707. It also addresses the monarchy’s <b>extraordinary</b> <b>revenue</b> accounts between June 1705 and June 1707, which reveal the multiple resources employed to fund the war during that critical period...|$|E

Four nonexclusive explanations for the correlation are discussed: (i) the growing potential gains of corruption; (ii) the number of transactions {{under the control of}} the local government; (iii) the pressure from groups of private rent-seekers and; (iv) revenue transfers might be the result of collusion between local governments and federal congressmen. Using data from the Controladoria-Geral da União (Brazilian Internal Audit Agency) Anticorruption Program based on the random auditing of municipal government’s expenditures, we study the relationship between amendments to the Brazilian Federal Budget Law and municipal corruption. On average, after controlling for a series of socio-economic and political variables, cities granted with revenue transfers derived from amendments have corruption rates that are 25 % higher than the rest of the sample. Although our empirical results indicate that the increase in corruption occurs when the municipalities receive <b>extraordinary</b> <b>revenue</b> transfers, corruption seems to be insensitive to the amount of resources transferred.

A esta organismo dirigido por el prelado y que crecía auspiciado por el cabildo, le correspondía para financiar su actividad la recaudación de un cúmulo importante de rentas de diferente naturaleza: rentas de los inmuebles adscritos a su patrimonio, excusados de Obra, aliceres, mandas y demandas e ingresos extraordinarios. La envergadura de estas rentas y una sabia gestión apoyada en un sólido aparato administrativo, forjado en base a la experiencia, venía a garantizar un sabio empleo de estos recursos financieros.
