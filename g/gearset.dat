25|$|A Getrag F23 5-speed manual or an Aisin AF23 5-speed {{automatic}} transmission were available. The compact 5-speed automatic had several unique characteristics. The transmission lacked an overdrive, allowing for five forward gears to be packaged {{in the size}} of a typical four-speed manual gearbox, both providing close gear ratios for better acceleration and fuel efficiency while eliminating the heat and parasitic loss generated by the additional planetary <b>gearset.</b> The unit was also “fill-for-life”, meaning that it was not intended to be serviced {{for the life of the}} vehicle. The 2003 and 2004 Ion Coupes were available with the VTi continuously variable transmission or a Getrag F23 5-speed manual.|$|E
25|$|During {{the post-war}} period, Lionel {{produced}} a construction set, utilizing a unique component set. While competitive sets used {{nut and bolt}} fasteners, the Lionel set employed round-head aircraft rivets retained with rubber grommets, {{eliminating the need for}} tools. The structural elements were hollow beams of square cross section made from folded and quite thin sheet aluminum, as a consequence subject to destruction if stepped upon. A more substantial folded aluminum base plate was used to form the foundation of most constructions, and additional circular plates could be used to construct larger wheels or pivots. Pulleys, gussets, and splices were also included. The deluxe kits included an electric AC motor with a worm drive and reduction <b>gearset</b> that was powered from household power. While innovative, the lack of general purpose beam members with lots of holes limited the adaptability of the set to complex constructions. Finished assemblies also lacked the robust durability of its principal competition at the time, the Erector Set.|$|E

50|$|Automatic {{transmission}} {{families are}} usually based on Ravigneaux, Lepelletier, or Simpson planetary <b>gearsets.</b> Each uses some arrangement {{of one or}} two central sun gears, and a ring gear, with differing arrangements of planet gears that surround the sun and mesh with the ring. An exception to this is the Hondamatic line from Honda, which uses sliding gears on parallel axes like a manual transmission without any planetary <b>gearsets.</b> Although the Honda is quite different from all other automatics, it is also quite different from an automated manual transmission (AMT).|$|R
50|$|The {{predominant}} form {{of automatic}} transmission is hydraulically operated; using a fluid coupling or torque converter, {{and a set}} of planetary <b>gearsets</b> to provide a range of gear ratios.|$|R
50|$|In 1921 Henry Ford & Son was {{acquired}} by the Ford Motor Company. Simpson became a design engineer at Ford, working primarily on tractor designs and planetary <b>gearsets.</b> He often worked directly with Henry Ford himself.|$|R
2500|$|The Turbo-Hydramatic {{heavy-duty}} three-speed {{automatic transmission}} became available during {{development of the}} Toronado. Called the TH425 in FWD form, the transmission's torque converter was separated from its planetary <b>gearset,</b> with the torque converter driving the <b>gearset</b> through a [...] wide silent chain-drive called Hy-Vo, riding on two [...] sprockets. The Hy-Vo chain drive was developed by GM's Hydra-Matic Division and Morse Chain Division of Borg-Warner. The chains were made from a very strong hardened steel and required no tensioners or idler pulleys because they were pre-stretched on a special machine at the factory. Although the rotation direction of the transmission's gearing had to be reversed, {{a large number of}} components were shared with the conventional TH400. Use of the automatic also obviated the need to devise a workable manual-shift linkage; no manual transmission was ever contemplated, as engineers deemed performance to be adequate with the automatic transmission and because virtually all U.S.-built luxury cars during this period came with automatic transmissions as standard equipment. With this, the [...] time was clocked in 9.5seconds.|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, Chrysler {{introduced}} the Spirit R/T, featuring {{a version of}} the 2.2L engine with a 16-valve DOHC head designed by Lotus, who won a design competition against Maserati and Hans Hermann. Fed by a Garrett intercooled turbocharger, the Turbo III engine produced [...] and [...] The R/T also featured unique interior and exterior trims. The only transmission was a heavy-duty A568 5-speed manual transmission built by Chrysler's New Process Gear division, with a <b>gearset</b> supplied by Getrag. Heavy-duty vented four wheel disc brakes were standard equipment, with optional anti-lock brakes. Color-keyed 15-inch alloy wheels were standard, with P205/60R15 tires.|$|E
2500|$|The {{general layout}} of the initial {{production}} platform is considered {{by some to be}} a plug-in series hybrid design (since mechanical power initially drives the generator, which in turn charges the battery pack), despite its transmission design that makes it, by definition, a parallel hybrid. Power is drained from the batteries to run the electrical motors which move the vehicle. The internal combustion engine can run at a constant speed for both optimal efficiency and mechanical simplicity (i.e., {{there is no need for}} variable cam phasing). [...] The Voltec, like the Prius, uses a planetary <b>gearset</b> to couple power from two sources to the wheels. Unlike the Prius, the Voltec only rarely drives the wheels with mechanical assist from the engine, and only when battery charge is depleted. The Voltec could therefore be considered a power-split hybrid.|$|E

50|$|Simpson left Ford in 1938. In 1948 he was {{diagnosed}} with cancer. Told he had less than six months to live, he moved to the American southwest (California and then Arizona). He spent much of his time drawing every arrangement he could conceive for planetary <b>gearsets,</b> filing patents on each. He was granted 23 patents in this field during his lifetime.|$|R
2500|$|Along {{with these}} chassis refinements, Sport package {{equipped}} models came with firmer rear shocks, bigger front brake calipers, and larger [...] rotors all around (up from 12.6/12.1-inch front/rear). Sport package equipped cars {{also get a}} viscous limited slip differential. An all-new Active Steering package can be ordered for sport package equipped models. It features a planetary <b>gearset</b> on the steering shaft (similar to BMW), that varies the steering ratio between 12.0:1 and 18.5:1. A rear-wheel steering system that induces up to one degree of rear steer is also included in this package. The Active Steering package includes even stiffer shocks than the sport package at all four corners and the ride has been repeatedly reported as being too stiff for most customers except the most [...] "enthusiastic" [...] drivers. Base and Journey model [...] tires bump up from 215s to 225s, while the [...] upgrade (included in sport or wheel package) with 225/50-ZR18 front and 245/45-ZR18 rear is now a size smaller in front and larger in back than the 1st gen model's all-around 235/45R18s.|$|E

50|$|The first rear {{mid-engined}} {{road car}} was the 1962 (Rene) Bonnet / Matra Djet, which used the 1108cc Renault Sierra engine, mated to the transaxle from the FWD Renault Estafette van. Nearly 1700 were built until 1967. This {{was followed by}} the first De Tomaso, the Vallelunga, which mated a tuned Ford Cortina 1500 Kent engine to a VW transaxle with Hewland <b>gearsets.</b> Introduced at Turin in 1963, 58 were built 1964-68.|$|R
50|$|Some Dana 61s {{shared a}} common carrier with the Dana 60 part #706040x, which means the <b>gearsets</b> (3.07-4.10) will {{interchange}} between the two. Dana differential case #706400 (3.07-3.73) shows in Dana's parts catalog to be Dana 61-specific. The 706040x carrier can be purchased relatively inexpensively and used to install lower gears in a Dana 61 axle, such as when replacing a broken or damaged Dana 60 with a Dana 61 while retaining the factory gear ratio.|$|R

Together with the Modelica simulation environment Dymola, this library is suited and used for HIL (Hardware-In-the-Loop) simulations...|$|R
5000|$|In Simpson's gearbox, {{the first}} gear {{is the most}} {{difficult}} to understand, and probably the one that causes most stress in the components. It happens because there is a feedback: the first <b>gearset</b> actuates on the second <b>gearset</b> and output shaft; the second <b>gearset</b> reacts and makes the sun turn in reverse, causing the first <b>gearset</b> to increase the reduction ratio. The mechanical energy has actually to [...] "loop" [...] in the <b>gearset</b> system until settling the ratio.|$|E
50|$|The Simpson <b>gearset</b> is {{now more}} or less obsolete. Other gearsets can make 4 forward gears with just two planetaries. Most modern {{gearboxes}} employ the Ravigneaux planetary <b>gearset</b> design, which produces 4 forward gears from a single set, or a Lepelletier <b>gearset</b> which provides 6 or more forward gears by adding another standard planetary to the Ravigneaux <b>gearset.</b>|$|E
50|$|Torqueflites use a torque {{converter}} and the Simpson <b>gearset,</b> two identical planetary gearsets sharing a common sun gear. Chrysler Corporation licensed this <b>gearset</b> from Simpson in 1955.|$|E
5000|$|Mixing of <b>gearsets</b> can be {{achieved}} due to the similarity between the various transmissions, but some gears must be interchanged in sets. First and second gear are integral to the input shaft and cannot be interchanged independently. All transmissions have a third gear ratio of 1.38:1. However, third and fourth gear are clustered on the counter shaft which was available with two different fourth gear ratios: 1.03:1 or [...]94:1. Fifth gear is independently interchangeable and available with a [...]80:1 and [...]72:1 ratio.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine was}} a 1.5 L straight-4 Kent engine from the Ford Cortina with [...] at 6200 rpm. A Volkswagen Beetle transaxle, fitted with Hewland <b>gearsets,</b> was used. The chassis was a pressed steel {{backbone}} with a tubular subframe at the rear. Suspension was double wishbone and coil springs at all four corners with {{front and rear}} anti-roll bars and with uprights sourced from Triumph. The small car weighed 1600 lb with a fiberglass body and many drilled aluminium parts. Brakes were disc all around.|$|R
40|$|Miniaturised dc-motors used in {{servomotor}} applications {{show some}} disadvantages like very high speed and therefore are combined with <b>gearsets</b> {{of a high}} gear ratio which introduce backlash and low efficiency.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1950s Simpson {{attempted}} {{to sell his}} patent to major American automakers in Detroit, but was greeted with skepticism, despite his experience and positive reputation. Ford Motor Company licensed his three-speed <b>gearset</b> in 1953, although they did not put it into production at that time. In 1955 Chrysler Corporation licensed the same <b>gearset</b> for use in their new three-speed Torqueflite automatic, which went into production in mid-1956. General Motors was reluctant to adopt this <b>gearset,</b> but eventually relented and licensed it for the Turbo Hydramatic, which entered production for the 1964 model year. Ford similarly introduced reengineered Cruise-O-Matic transmissions (C3, C4, and C6) using the <b>gearset</b> they had already licensed. The Simpson-geared Cruise-O-Matics were introduced in the 1964 and 1965 model years. Germany's Daimler-Benz licensed the <b>gearset</b> as well, although it did not enter production until the early 1970s, as the Mercedes-Benz three-speed automatic.|$|E

It's the boundary between both continuously variable ranges. The two-modes switching occurs at this point, when the third planetary <b>gearset</b> ring gear reach zero rotational speed, and all the planetary <b>gearset</b> carriers gears reach the same rotational speed together.|$|E
50|$|First Power Split Mode, {{also known}} as Input-Split:(clutches C1 engaged, C2+C3+C4 released)The first {{planetary}} <b>gearset</b> pair acts as a four-driveshaft power-split transmission, and the last planetary <b>gearset</b> reduces the rotational speed. The second motor-generator (MG-B) rotational speed {{is proportional to the}} output driveshaft.|$|E
50|$|The 4F27E is a {{strengthened}} 4-speed F-4EAT automatic. It {{now has a}} four-element {{torque converter}} that includes a torque converter clutch and geartrain with two planetary <b>gearsets,</b> a transfer-shaft gear final drive, and a larger differential. The hydraulic control system of the 4F27E transaxle has six electronically controlled solenoids for shift feel (through line pressure control), shift scheduling (through shift valve position control) and TCC (torque converter clutch) apply, controlled by pulse-width modulation (PWM). The Mazda FS5A-EL (Ford FNR5) is the 5-speed successor to this transmission. It uses {{many of the same}} parts.|$|R
40|$|Acoustic {{intensity}} {{measurements were}} made at NASA Lewis Research Center on a spur gear test apparatus. The measurements were obtained with the Robotic Acoustic Intensity Measurement System developed by Cleveland State University. This system provided dense spatial positioning, and was calibrated against a high quality acoustic intensity system. The measured gear noise compared <b>gearsets</b> having two different tooth profiles. The tests evaluated the sound field of the different gears for two speeds and three loads. The experimental results showed that gear tooth profile had a major effect on measured noise. Load and speed {{were found to have}} an effect on noise also...|$|R
40|$|A {{spur gear}} {{efficiency}} prediction method previously {{developed by the}} authors was extended to include power loss of planetary <b>gearsets.</b> A friction coefficient model was developed for MIL-L- 7808 oil based on disc machine data. This combined with the recent capability of predicting losses in spur gears of nonstandard proportions allows the calculation of power loss for complete aircraft gearboxes that utilize spur gears.

50|$|In 1968, part-throttle {{downshift}} functionality {{was added}} to A-904 transmissions used with 6-cylinder engines. This feature permitted the transmission to shift from third to second gear in response to moderate accelerator pressure. Previously, an automatic 3-2 downshift occurred only if the driver pushed the accelerator to the floor. This change was made to maintain acceptable in-town performance with taller final-drive ratios in the rear axle — 2.76:1 rear axle gears were being furnished in applications previously equipped with 2.93:1 or 3.23:1 <b>gearsets.</b> Part-throttle downshift functionality was extended to V8 A-904s in 1969, and to most A-727 transmissions in 1970 to 1971.|$|R
50|$|Triple-cone {{synchronizers}} {{are used}} on 1st and 2nd gears. These synchronizers have three friction surfaces, which increase {{their ability to}} transfer the flow of torque more smoothly from one gear to another. Synchronizers act as clutches to speed up or slow down the <b>gearsets</b> that are being shifted to, and greater friction area results in easier shifting for the driver. The 3rd, 4th, and reverse synchronizers are double-cone, while the 5th and 6th gear synchronizers are single-cone. All of the friction surfaces on the Synchronizer rings are sintered bronze. The ratios in the 6-speed are widely spaced for versatile performance and efficiency.|$|R
5000|$|The Hydramatic used a two-element fluid {{coupling}} (not a torque converter, which {{has at least}} three elements, the pump, turbine and stator although Roto HydraMatic has a {{fluid coupling}} and a fixed stator) and three planetary <b>gearsets,</b> providing four forward speeds plus reverse.
