5|$|Advocates for {{the diet}} {{recommend}} {{that it be}} seriously considered after two medications have failed, as the chance of other drugs succeeding is only 10%. The diet can be considered earlier for some epilepsy and genetic syndromes where it has shown particular usefulness. These include Dravet syndrome, <b>infantile</b> spasms, myoclonic-astatic epilepsy and tuberous sclerosis complex.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, a young Davis had {{appeared}} as a National Foundation for <b>Infantile</b> Paralysis volunteer in a memorable short subject shown in movie theaters to raise donations for the crusade against polio. The Crippler featured a sinister figure spreading over playgrounds and farms, laughing over its victims, until finally dispelled by the volunteer. It was very effective in raising contributions.|$|E
5|$|One theory interprets Putana {{as being}} the first foe faced by Krishna (further {{numerous}} demons are sent by Kamsa to kill Krishna) or as the first obstacle of possessive maternal instinct faced by yogis. The legend assures a devotee liberation if they treat god as their own son. Another theory interprets Putana as an <b>infantile</b> disease that Krishna survived, which can be cured by forcefully suckling the child affected. Further, the theory relates to Krishna's later life when he fights a demon called Jvara (fever).|$|E

5|$|Putana is {{interpreted}} as an <b>infantile</b> disease or bird, symbolizing danger to an infant or desire respectively, and even as a symbolic bad mother. She is included {{in a group of}} malevolent Hindu mother goddesses called the Matrikas and also in the group of Yoginis and Grahinis (Seizers). Ancient Indian medical texts prescribe her worship to protect children from diseases. A group of multiple Putanas is mentioned in ancient Indian texts.|$|E
5|$|Reactive {{arthritis}} {{occurs in}} 1% of people following infections with Campylobacter species, and Guillain–Barré syndrome occurs in 0.1%. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) may occur due to infection with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli or Shigella species, causing low platelet counts, poor kidney function, and low {{red blood cell}} count (due to their breakdown). Children are more predisposed to getting HUS than adults. Some viral infections may produce benign <b>infantile</b> seizures.|$|E
5|$|Vincent DiStephano was not {{included}} in the original screenplay for Alien: Resurrection, but director Jean-Pierre Jeunet admired Cruz' previous work and had casting director Rick Pagano arrange a meeting. DiStephano was added to the cast as the remaining soldier and guide for the band of survivors. In Alien Zone II: The Spaces of Science-fiction Cinema, Annette Kuhn calls DiStephano's death at the hands of the Newborn a perverse joke because of its juxtaposition of <b>infantile</b> features and curiosity with gruesome killing.|$|E

5|$|Wilson's {{disease is}} the most common from a group of {{hereditary}} diseases that cause copper overload in the liver. All can cause cirrhosis at a young age. The other members of the group are Indian childhood cirrhosis (ICC), endemic Tyrolean <b>infantile</b> cirrhosis and idiopathic copper toxicosis. These are not related to ATP7B mutations: for example, ICC has been linked to mutations in the KRT8 and the KRT18 gene.|$|E
5|$|Krueger {{retired to}} San Antonio, Texas, where, in February 1946, {{he bought a}} house for the first time. Because of a large income tax bill {{left over from the}} war, he was unable to buy it {{outright}} and so some of his friends established the Krueger Fund Committee, which paid for much of the house. In retirement, Krueger was involved in a number of charity and community organizations, including the United Service Organization, the Red Cross, and the National Foundation for <b>Infantile</b> Paralysis, and he served as director of civil defense for San Antonio and Bexar County.|$|E
5|$|Poliomyelitis, {{often called}} polio or <b>infantile</b> paralysis, is an {{infectious}} disease {{caused by the}} poliovirus. In about 0.5 percent of cases there is muscle weakness resulting in an inability to move. This can occur over {{a few hours to}} a few days. The weakness most often involves the legs but may less commonly involve the muscles of the head, neck and diaphragm. Many but not all people fully recover. In those with muscle weakness about 2 to 5 percent of children and 15 to 30 percent of adults die. Another 25 percent of people have minor symptoms such as fever and a sore throat and up to 5 percent have headache, neck stiffness and pains in the arms and legs. These people are usually back to normal within one or two weeks. In up to 70 percent of infections there are no symptoms. Years after recovery post-polio syndrome may occur, with a slow development of muscle weakness similar to that which the person had during the initial infection.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration has {{approved}} several drugs for managing {{some of the}} major manifestations of TSC. The antiepileptic medication vigabatrinwas approved in 2009 for treatment of <b>infantile</b> spasms and was recommended as first-line therapy for <b>infantile</b> spasms in children with TSC by the 2012 International TSC Consensus Conference. Adrenocorticotropic hormone was approved in 2010 to treat <b>infantile</b> spasms. Everolimus was approved for treatment of TSC-related tumors in the brain (subependymal giant cell astrocytoma) in 2010 and in the kidneys (renal angiomyolipoma) in 2012. Everolimus also showed evidence of effectiveness at treating epilepsy in some people with TSC. In 2017, the European Commission approved everolimus for treatment of refractory partial-onset seizures associated with TSC.|$|E
