5|$|Above the troposphere, the {{atmosphere}} is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. Each layer <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> lapse rate, defining {{the rate of change}} in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The Kármán line, defined as 100km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between {{the atmosphere}} and outer space.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} level, the rocket stays {{assembled}} and just requires refuelling. However, every four levels, the rocket resets (giving the player an extra life) and the replacement {{has to be}} built {{before it can be}} re-fuelled for take off. Each new model has a new design with a higher number written on it, although the gameplay remains unchanged. The enemies change forms each level (cycling back to the first after eight levels) and each alien <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> pattern of movement which means they can be dealt with in a different manner.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his speech}} to the NAACP, Wright speculated that, [...] "Africans <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> meter, and Africans <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> tonality. Europeans <b>have</b> seven tones, Africans have five. White people clap {{differently}} than black people. Africans and African-Americans are right-brained, subject-oriented in their learning style. They <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> way of learning." [...] The comments were labeled as racist, and likened to eugenics. This initiated {{a revival of the}} controversy, which had been slowly waning.|$|R

People with <b>a</b> <b>different</b> mother’s occupation or household income per month <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> correct rate of Go/Nogo. This implies that the performance of participants could be affected by their demographic variables (i.e., native place, household income, parents’ occupation). In some way, this may happen during their growth experience (Anacker et al., 2014;DePrince and Kristin, 2009; DePrince et al., 2009).|$|R

Although many items have returned from previous Super Smash Bros. games, new ones have been introduced as well. Some returning items have changed appearance and function. Two varieties of items, Assist Trophies and Poké Balls, temporarily summon guest characters and Pokémon, respectively, that generally aid the summoner. They cannot be controlled by players and are usually invincible.|$|E

However, the early prototypes of the TR-85M1 were known as the TR-85M or TR-85M1A. The add-on armour of these tanks <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> shape and was welded. Additionally, the turret bustle <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> shape and the bore evacuator <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> position. <b>A</b> TR-85M1A variant is currently on display at the National Military Museum in Bucharest.|$|R
5|$|Lactarius repraesentaneus {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to Lactarius scrobiculatus, which has latex that turns yellow when exposed to air, a different smell, a stinging flesh and a different reaction of the milk to alkali: in L.scrobiculatus the milk turns reddish-orange while that of L.representaneus does not change color. Lactarius uvidus also has a violet reaction but it <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> color and is not hairy at {{the margin of the}} cap.

5|$|Shattered Memories {{retains the}} premise of the {{original}} game—Harry Mason's quest to find his missing daughter in the fictitious American town of Silent Hill—but is set in a different fictional universe, <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> plot, and altered characters, alongside new ones. Five endings are available. Gameplay takes place in two parts: a framing, first-person psychotherapy session, and an over-the-shoulder perspective of Harry's journey through Silent Hill, which is periodically interrupted by the occurrence of a shift to an alternate dimension. Answers given to the psychological tests in the therapy session affect various gameplay elements in Harry's journey.|$|E

It is considered a masterwork for its accurate detail and composition. Copies include a larger version by Bruegel's son Pieter Brueghel the Younger, and the work has inspired literature such as poetry by Charles Baudelaire and William Carlos Williams, and a novel by Gert Hofmann.|$|E
5|$|The song {{begins with}} a {{distinctly}} Vivaldian style, as the fast tempo and classical-style chord progression anticipates the lyrics to follow. The opening chords and the melody emphasize the tonic of the leading notes: Fm–E–D–Cm–D–E–Fm–D–E–Fm, resembling a Baroque work. This {{is followed by the}} sound of dance music, produced by a powerful beat from the instruments. Madonna's vocal range spans from F3 to C5, and <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> sound from her previous work, more mature, centered, and with a lower range.|$|E
5|$|The term {{metalloid}} originally {{referred to}} nonmetals. Its more recent meaning, {{as a category}} of elements with intermediate or hybrid properties, became widespread in 1940–1960. Metalloids are sometimes called semimetals, a practice that has been discouraged, as the term semimetal <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> meaning in physics than in chemistry. In physics it more specifically refers to the electronic band structure of a substance.|$|E

5|$|Dating Lindow Man is {{problematic}} as {{samples from the}} body and surrounding peat have produced dates spanning a 900-year period. Although the peat encasing Lindow Man has been radiocarbon dated to about 300BC, Lindow Man himself <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> date. Early tests at different laboratories returned conflicting dates for the body; later tests suggested a date between 2BC and 119AD. There has been a tendency to ascribe the body to the Iron Age period rather than Roman due to the interpretation that Lindow Man's death {{may have been a}} ritual sacrifice or execution. Explanations for why the peat in which he was found is much older have been sought. Archaeologist P.C.Buckland suggests that as the stratigraphy of the peat appears undisturbed, Lindow Man may have been deposited into a pool that was already some 300years old. Geographer K.E.Barber has argued against this hypothesis, saying that pools at Lindow Moss would have been too shallow, and suggests that the peat may have been peeled back to allow the burial and then replaced, leaving the stratigraphy apparently undisturbed.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the telerecorded material, some early 1970s material survives only, or in colour only, on NTSC videotapes produced for North American transmission (e.g., TV Ontario and CKVU in Vancouver). NTSC runs at a different framerate than PAL video, and <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> number of scanlines. The conversion process used in the 1970s was primitive by modern standards, resulting in a noticeable amount of picture and motion loss. Converting the NTSC tapes back to PAL introduces more artifacts, creating a blurry picture and juddering motion. To rectify the problem, in 2005 a new Reverse Standards Conversion process, which attempts to unpick the original video conversion, was introduced for the DVD release of The Claws of Axos.|$|E
