5|$|The {{standard}} {{method of cooling}} is passing a coolant (usually water) {{through a series of}} holes drilled through the mould plates and connected by hoses to form a continuous pathway. The coolant absorbs heat from the mould (which has absorbed heat <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> plastic) and keeps the mould at a proper temperature to solidify the plastic at the most efficient rate.|$|E
5|$|Deep frying is {{done with}} a deep fryer, a pan such as a wok or chip pan, a Dutch oven, or a {{cast-iron}} pot. Additional tools include fry baskets, which are used to contain foods in a deep fryer and to strain foods when removed from the oil, and cooking thermometers, used to gauge oil temperature. Tongs, slotted spoons, wooden spoons, and sieves {{may be used to}} remove or separate foods <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> oil.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{its vast}} size {{and range of}} altitudes, Argentina {{possesses}} {{a wide variety of}} climatic regions, ranging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> subtropical region in the north to the cold subantarctic in the far south. Lying between those is the Pampas region, featuring a mild and humid climate. Many regions have different, often contrasting, microclimates. In general, Argentina has four main climate types: warm, moderate, arid, and cold in which the relief features, and the latitudinal extent of the country, determine the different varieties within the main climate types.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{winds are}} strongest {{immediately}} under the tropopause (except locally, during tornadoes, tropical cyclones or other anomalous situations). If two air masses of different temperatures or densities meet, the resulting pressure difference {{caused by the}} density difference (which ultimately causes wind) is highest within the transition zone. The wind does not flow directly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> to the cold area, but is deflected by the Coriolis effect and flows along the boundary of the two air masses.|$|E
5|$|The Snake River Plain is a {{volcanic}} province {{that was created}} {{by a series of}} cataclysmic caldera-forming eruptions which started about 15 million years ago. A migrating hotspot thought to now exist under Yellowstone Caldera in Yellowstone National Park has been implicated. This hot spot was under the Craters of the Moon area some 10 to 11million years ago but 'moved' as the North American Plate migrated southwestward. Pressure <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> spot heaves the land surface up, creating fault-block mountains. After the hot spot passes the pressure is released and the land subsides.|$|E

40|$|We discuss two themes from Chandra cluster observations. First, we {{describe}} the interaction of buoyant, radio emitting plasma bubbles with <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> intracluster gas. Second we summarize the Chandra observations of "cold" fronts (sharp discontinuities in gas density and temperature) separating cool, denser gas clouds <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hotter</b> intracluster medium...|$|R
5|$|After a {{star has}} formed, it generates thermal {{energy in the}} dense core region through nuclear fusion of {{hydrogen}} atoms into helium. During {{this stage of the}} star's lifetime, it is located along the main sequence at a position determined primarily by its mass, but also based upon its chemical composition and other factors. All main-sequence stars are in hydrostatic equilibrium, where outward thermal pressure <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> core is balanced by the inward pressure of gravitational collapse from the overlying layers. The strong dependence of the rate of energy generation in the core on the temperature and pressure helps to sustain this balance. Energy generated at the core makes its way to the surface and is radiated away at the photosphere. The energy is carried by either radiation or convection, with the latter occurring in regions with steeper temperature gradients, higher opacity or both.|$|E
5|$|It {{is often}} claimed {{that at the}} time, the pass of Thermopylae {{consisted}} of a track along {{the shore of the}} Malian Gulf so narrow that only one chariot could pass through at a time. In fact, as noted below, the pass was 100 metres wide, probably wider than the Greeks could have held against the Persian hordes. Herodotus reports that the Phocians had improved the defenses of the pass by channelling the stream <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> springs to create a marsh, and it was a causeway across this marsh which was only wide enough for a single chariot to traverse. In a later passage, describing a Gaulish attempt to force the pass, Herodotus describes how the Gauls who fell into the marsh disappeared and were drowned.|$|E
5|$|The offset boiler {{and coal}} bunker caused the locomotive's {{centre of gravity}} to be shifted to one side. Experiments had to be {{undertaken}} to balance the locomotive by filling the linking corridor with large quantities of scrap metal, replaced in a re-design by a raised floor, covering the weighted material. These modifications resulted in the engine exceeding the total weight limit of 150 tons (151 tonnes), severely limiting the design's route availability during testing. A related problem was that despite being a tall locomotive, at , the cab ceilings were relatively low. The cab at the smokebox end of the locomotive suffered from the same excessive heat as did the fireman's cab. To circumvent this problem the locomotive was used in reverse, as the rear cab was next to the water tank and coal chute and therefore away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> gases circulating inside the smokebox.|$|E
5000|$|Conventional {{heat pipes}} {{transfer}} heat in either direction, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hotter</b> to <b>the</b> colder {{end of the}} heat pipe. Several different heat pipes act as a thermal diode, transferring heat in one direction, while acting as an insulator in the other: ...|$|R

25|$|This {{definition}} of efficiency {{makes sense for}} a heat engine, {{since it is the}} fraction of the heat energy extracted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> reservoir and converted to mechanical work. A Rankine cycle is usually the practical approximation.|$|E
5000|$|Service Remote Locations - Given that {{relocatable}} {{buildings are}} constructed offsite in controlled settings, finding a skilled labor force in remote locations {{is less of}} an issue. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>hottest,</b> driest desert locations to the coldest, most severe winter climates, relocatable buildings can be utilized anywhere.|$|R

The public first heard him rap on OutKast's first album, Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, on the song Git Up, Git Out.|$|R
50|$|In {{mesoscopic}} heat engines, work per {{cycle of}} operation fluctuates due to thermal noise.

25|$|The sodium {{bicarbonate}} (NaHCO3) that precipitates out in reaction (I) is filtered out <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) solution, and {{the solution is}} then reacted with the quicklime (calcium oxide (CaO)) left over from heating the limestone in step (II).|$|E
25|$|As {{the fuel}} of a LFTR is a molten salt mixture, it is {{attractive}} to use pyroprocessing, high temperature methods working directly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> molten salt. Pyroprocessing does not use radiation sensitive solvents and is not easily disturbed by decay heat.|$|E
25|$|His {{earliest}} {{influence was}} gypsy jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hot</b> Club of Paris. Other influences include mentor Ike Isaacs, Ted Greene, Kenny Burrell, Wes Montgomery, and Joe Pass. Although Taylor {{is inspired by}} many guitarists, musically he relates more to pianists, particularly Art Tatum.|$|E

50|$|A {{prime example}} of {{irreversibility}} is in the transfer of heat by conduction or radiation. It was known long before {{the discovery of the}} notion of entropy that when two bodies initially of different temperatures come into thermal connection, then heat always flows <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hotter</b> body to <b>the</b> colder one.|$|R

25|$|The firebox was {{separate}} from the boiler and was double walled, with a water jacket between them. Stephenson recognised that the hottest part of the boiler, and thus the most effective for evaporating water, was that surrounding the fire itself. This firebox was heated by radiant heat from the glowing coke, not just convection <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> exhaust gas.|$|E
25|$|X-ray {{continuum}} emission. This {{can arise}} both from a jet and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> corona of the accretion disc via a scattering process: {{in both cases}} it shows a power-law spectrum. In some radio-quiet AGN there is an excess of soft X-ray emission {{in addition to the}} power-law component. The origin of the soft X-rays is not clear at present.|$|E
25|$|Direct contact {{membrane}} distillation (DCMD). Applicable to desalination. Heated seawater is passed along {{the surface of}} a hydrophobic polymer membrane. Evaporated water passes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> side through pores in the membrane into a stream of cold pure water on the other side. The difference in vapour pressure between the hot and cold side helps to push water molecules through.|$|E
