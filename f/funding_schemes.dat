The Mandatory Provident <b>Fund</b> <b>Schemes</b> Authority (MPFA), up and running in September 2000, is charged with supervising the provision of MPF schemes - it registers schemes and ensures that approved trustees administer schemes prudently.

25|$|In {{the pension}} industry, actuarial methods {{are used to}} measure the costs of {{alternative}} strategies with regard to the design, funding, accounting, administration, and maintenance or redesign of pension plans. The strategies are greatly influenced by short-term and long-term bond rates, the funded status of the pension and benefit arrangements, collective bargaining; the employer's old, new and foreign competitors; the changing demographics of the workforce; changes in the internal revenue code; changes in the attitude of the internal revenue service regarding the calculation of surpluses; and equally importantly, both the short and long term financial and economic trends. It is common with mergers and acquisitions that several pension plans have to be combined or at least administered on an equitable basis. When benefit changes occur, old and new benefit plans have to be blended, satisfying new social demands and various government discrimination test calculations, and providing employees and retirees with understandable choices and transition paths. Benefit plans liabilities have to be properly valued, reflecting both earned benefits for past service, and the benefits for future service. Finally, <b>funding</b> <b>schemes</b> have to be developed that are manageable and satisfy the standards board or regulators of the appropriate country, such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board in the United States.|$|E

Market Street, near the explosion {{and at that}} time the second-busiest shopping street in the UK, was considered by some commentators a [...] "fearful" [...] place, to be [...] "avoided like the plague". Until Margaret Thatcher's third consecutive election victory in 1987, the staunchly Labour-controlled Manchester Council believed that Manchester's regeneration should be funded solely by public money, despite the government's insistence on only <b>funding</b> <b>schemes</b> with a significant element of private investment. Graham Stringer, leader of Manchester City Council, later admitted that after the 1987 General Election result [...] "there was no get out of jail card. We had gambled on Labour winning the General Election and we lost." [...] Thatcher's victory effectively put paid to Manchester's [...] "socialist experiment", and Stringer shortly afterwards wrote a letter of capitulation to Nicholas Ridley, then Secretary of State for the Environment, saying, [...] "in a nutshell; OK, you win, we'd like to work together with you".|$|E
