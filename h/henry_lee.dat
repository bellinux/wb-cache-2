5|$|Little {{is known}} of Mason's {{political}} views prior to the 1760s, {{when he came to}} oppose British colonial policies. In 1758, Mason successfully ran for the House of Burgesses when George William Fairfax, holder of one of Fairfax County's two seats, chose not to seek re-election. Also elected were Mason's brother Thomson (for Stafford County), George Washington (for Frederick County where he was stationed as commander of Virginia's militia as the French and Indian War continued) and Richard <b>Henry</b> <b>Lee,</b> who would work closely with Mason through their careers.|$|E
5|$|Illness forced Mason to absent {{himself from}} the Committee of Safety for several weeks in 1775, {{and he did not}} attend the fourth convention, held in December 1775 and January 1776. With {{independence}} from Britain widely accepted as necessary among prominent Virginians, the fifth convention, to meet in May 1776 at Williamsburg, would need to decide how Virginia would be administered henceforth, as the royal government was dead in all but name. Accordingly, the convention was seen as so important that Richard <b>Henry</b> <b>Lee</b> arranged for his temporary recall from Congress {{to be a part of}} the convention, and Jefferson tried but failed to arrange to leave Congress as well. Other notables elected to the convention were Henry, George Wythe, and a young delegate from Orange County, James Madison. Mason was elected for Fairfax County, though with great difficulty.|$|E

5|$|The British Parliament's {{efforts to}} levy new taxes {{following}} the French and Indian War were deeply unpopular in the colonies. In the House of Burgesses, opposition to {{taxation without representation}} was led by Patrick Henry and Richard <b>Henry</b> <b>Lee,</b> among others. Virginians began to coordinate their actions with other colonies in 1773, and sent delegates to the Continental Congress the following year. After the House of Burgesses was dissolved by the royal governor in 1774, Virginia's revolutionary leaders continued to govern via the Virginia Conventions. On May 15, 1776, the Convention declared Virginia's independence from the British Empire and adopted George Mason's Virginia Declaration of Rights, which was then included in a new constitution. Another Virginian, Thomas Jefferson, drew upon Mason's work in drafting the national Declaration of Independence.|$|E

25|$|The CIB hired renowned {{forensic}} scientist <b>Henry</b> <b>Lee</b> ({{forensic scientist}}) {{to examine the}} physical evidence. Dr. <b>Henry</b> <b>Lee</b> was famous for defending O.J.

Dr. <b>Henry</b> <b>Lee</b> and his team of Americans had previously established the belly wound was in fact a gunshot wound, and then claimed the windshield hole had been struck from the outside based on the lack of windshield powder outside the jeep. Despite widespread speculation that the casings were planted on the street, Lee expressed no concern regarding the origin of the evidence even though the casings had been found some 3½ hours after the incident occurred and street cleaning had cleaned up the firecracker debris. Dr. Lee was also not critical of the local police and National Security Bureau's inability to secure the scene of the incident afterwards until the casings were found.|$|E
