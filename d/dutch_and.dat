5|$|On 25 July, Visscher's {{replacement}} Abraham Roos—sent in late June because Visscher {{was considered}} mentally unstable—arrived in Semarang with 170 men, {{noting that the}} company only controlled the fortress, European quarters and beachhead. After Roos' arrival, the Dutch government began sending more reinforcements, eventually totalling at least 1,400 <b>Dutch</b> <b>and</b> 1,600 Indonesian soldiers. By November 1741, the company's fortress in Semarang was surrounded by 3,500 Chinese and 20,000 Javanese troops, who were armed with 30 cannons, as opposed to 3,400 <b>Dutch</b> <b>and</b> loyalist troops. With the superior Dutch firepower and tactics causing 's troops to scatter, the siege was eventually broken and an expedition was able to reclaim Jepara.|$|E

5|$|Culture in the Netherlands {{at the end}} of the 15th {{century was}} {{influenced}} by the Italian Renaissance through trade via Bruges, which made Flanders wealthy. Its nobles commissioned artists who became known across Europe. In science, the anatomist Andreas Vesalius led the way; in cartography, Gerardus Mercator's map assisted explorers and navigators. In art, <b>Dutch</b> <b>and</b> Flemish Renaissance painting ranged from the strange work of Hieronymus Bosch to the everyday life depictions of Pieter Brueghel the Elder.|$|E

5|$|On 4 May 1702 (O.S.) England {{formally}} {{declared war}} on France. Marlborough was given command of the English, <b>Dutch,</b> <b>and</b> hired German forces, {{but he had not}} as yet commanded a large army in the field, and had far less experience than a dozen <b>Dutch</b> <b>and</b> German generals who must now work under him. His command had its limitations, however. As commander of Anglo-Dutch forces he had the power to give orders to Dutch generals only when their troops were in action with his own; at all other times he had to rely on his powers of tact and persuasion, and gain the consent of accompanying Dutch field deputies or political representatives of the States General. Nevertheless, despite his Allies' initial lassitude the campaign in the Low Countries (the war's principal theatre) began well for Marlborough. After outmanoeuvring Marshal Boufflers, he captured Venlo, Roermond, Stevensweert and Liège, for which in December a grateful Queen publicly proclaimed Marlborough a duke.|$|E
