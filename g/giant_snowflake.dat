50|$|Harbin has {{a number}} of large, {{multi-level}} underground shopping areas, originally built for air defense. The largest is at the roundabout intersection of Xida Zhi street and Hongjun street where three levels of markets following streets from four directions meet under the <b>giant</b> <b>snowflake</b> atrium.|$|E
5000|$|In a July 1958 {{issue of}} Superman, he {{journeys}} to Pluto to obtain <b>giant</b> <b>snowflakes,</b> {{so cold that}} they will not melt on Earth, for inclusion among the collection of “space trophies” which the Metropolis Museum can collect for a time capsule to open in the 50th century.|$|R
50|$|Several {{mutations}} {{have long}} been established, including Californian Jumbo, Wisconsin Jumbo, Northern <b>Giant,</b> Albino, <b>Snowflake,</b> Blonde, Fawn, Barred, Silver, and Red.|$|R
5000|$|The Atommobile {{entered the}} Monsanto Mighty Microscope {{and began to}} shake {{back and forth as}} the riders entered the darkness. As their vision returned, the riders saw <b>giant</b> <b>snowflakes</b> all around them, some still {{spinning}} as they fell. As they continued to shrink, the narrator exclaimed, [...] "I am passing beyond the magnification limits of even the most powerful microscopes. These are snowflakes - and yet they seem to grow larger and larger. Or can I be shrinking - shrinking beyond the smallness of a tiny snowflake crystal? Indeed, I am becoming smaller and smaller!" ...|$|R
50|$|One of {{his later}} works, Lobby-for-the-Time-Being is an {{installation}} in the North Wing Lobby of Bronx Museum of the Arts. It {{has been there}} since 2009. The installation fills the lobby with a web of white Corian, creating a long, undulating wall resembling <b>giant</b> paper <b>snowflakes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 2015 - The [...] "Jingle Cruise" [...] overlay from 2014 was reused for the 2015 holiday season, {{using the}} 2014 script, boat names, and show scenes. There was one new scene added, {{involving}} <b>giant</b> snowmen and <b>snowflakes</b> on the termite mounds by the African Veldt.|$|R
60|$|She effectually {{prevented}} reply, even if such {{had been}} intended, by suddenly seizing her little charge round {{the neck and}} kissing his right eye passionately. Master Charlie cared nothing for that. He gazed past her at the gulls with the unobliterated eye. When she {{kissed him on the}} left cheek, he gazed past her at the gulls with the other eye. When she let him go, he continued to gaze at the gulls with both eyes. He had often seen the same gulls at a distance, from the lower level of Bounty Bay, but he had never before stood on their own giddy cliffs, and watched them from their own favourite bird's-eye-view point; for there were thousands of them sloping, diving, and wheeling in the airy abyss, pictured against the dark blue sea below, as well as thousands more circling upwards, floating and gyrating in the bright blue sky above. It seemed as if <b>giant</b> <b>snowflakes</b> were trembling in the air in all directions. Some of the gulls came so near to those who watched them that their black inquiring eyes became distinctly visible; others swept towards them with rustling wings, as if intending to strike, and then glanced sharply off, or upwards, with wild cries.|$|R
50|$|On 9 November 2009, a {{video was}} posted on YouTube for the single. In the video, {{the band members}} appear to be lost in a <b>giant</b> maze with <b>snowflakes</b> {{drifting}} down from the sky. All members are playing their separate instruments, while Ian Kenny is singing and wandering around in the maze. Once the song goes into the chorus, all the members except Ian appear together (whereas before they were wondering apart) and start jamming, while a black substance shoots {{up into the sky}} around them. All this is mixed with footage of water rushing down a section of the maze. This is how the video continues until the end, which shows Ian kneeling in front of what looks like a giant mirror. A transparent hand reaches out of the mirror, and just when Ian's hand is about to touch the other hand the song ends and the video fades out.|$|R
