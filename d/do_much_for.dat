5|$|Alarmed by over grazing of meadows, logging {{of giant}} sequoia, and other damage, Muir changed {{from being a}} {{promoter}} and scientist to an advocate for further protection. He persuaded many influential people to camp {{with him in the}} area, such as Ralph Waldo Emerson in 1871. Muir tried to convince his guests that the entire area should be under federal protection. None of his guests through the 1880s could <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> Muir's cause, except for Robert Underwood Johnson, editor of Century Magazine. Through Johnson, Muir had a national audience for his writing and a highly motivated and crafty congressional lobbyist.|$|E
25|$|However, making {{cotton and}} {{textiles}} fair trade {{does not always}} benefit laborers. Burkina Faso and Mali export the largest amount of cotton in Africa. Although many cotton plantations in these countries attained fair trade certification in the 1990s, participation in fair trade further ingrains existing power relations and inequalities that cause poverty in Africa rather than challenging them. Fair trade does not <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> farmers when it does not challenge the system that marginalizes producers. Despite not empowering farmers, the change to fair trade cotton has positive effects including female participation in cultivation.|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club's Noel Murray graded {{the episode}} with an A-, admitting that despite its faults, he [...] "enjoyed {{the hell out}} of" [...] it. He loved it for several reasons: he is {{a big fan of}} Anna Torv's Bellivia {{performance}} and its plotline, the drugs incorporated into the plot, its Inception-like qualities, the animation, and Bell's final goodbye. IGN Fringe reviewer Ramsey Isler rated the episode 8.0/10, calling it [...] "one of the most memorable Fringe episodes to date." [...] Like Murray, Isler also noted the similarities to Inception {{as well as to the}} 1968 film Yellow Submarine and the 1977 science fiction novel A Scanner Darkly. Isler did however remark that [...] "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide" [...] "end a string of episodes that didn't really have much point", though it was a [...] "beautiful episode that doesn't really <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> the mythology of the series... it sure was a blast to watch." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. IGN columnist Brian Zoromski rated [...] "The Coup" [...] 7.8/10, indicating it as a [...] "good" [...] episode. He felt {{that after the}} [...] "brilliant" [...] episode from the previous week, [...] "The Coup" [...] was [...] "somewhat anticlimactic, as Jim doesn't interact at all with the Scranton branch and the Pam-Jim storyline is pretty much ignored." [...] Despite his disappointment with Jim's storyline, Zoromski commented that the [...] "best moments of the episode were the completely random ones, such as Dwight knowing that Jan wears blouses from Liz Claiborne and earrings from Ann Taylor." [...] AOLTV's Michael Sciannamea was also unhappy with Jim's scenes, writing that they were [...] "beginning to grate on [...] Is every branch office at Dunder Mifflin filled with crazies? How then does the company stay in business? I {{think it would have}} been funnier if Jim ended up in an office where it's nothing but work and no play at all. The Call of Duty bits didn't <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> me." ...|$|E
500|$|A mixed {{review was}} given by Andy Gill of The Independent who said that [...] "the vocal editing on 'Start Over' is far too sloppy, {{confirming}} again that a series of individual flourishes doesn't pass muster as a performance." [...] David Amidon of PopMatters also gave a mixed review for [...] "Start Over" [...] and [...] "Countdown" [...] saying that they [...] "just don't seem to be listening to themselves, and will get by on listenability more than lyrical wizardry if they get by at all." [...] Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone also gave a mixed review for the song, saying: [...] "While the other songs on 4 all have a distinct flavor and give Beyoncé an opportunity {{to try something new}} in some way or another, 'Start Over' just kind of sits there at the middle of the disc not doing much of anything." [...] He also noted that [...] "Start Over" [...] was an [...] "inoffensive ballad that doesn't <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> the record aside from break its momentum at the halfway point." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mixed, calling it a [...] "slow start to the season." [...] Dan Iverson of IGN {{reviewed}} the episode positively, noting that the episode [...] "would make even the most anti-Family Guy television viewers out there laugh pretty hard." [...] Iverson went on to comment, however, that [...] "it probably won't be remembered as fondly as some {{of the episode}}s from the first few seasons." [...] For him, the [...] "funniest aspect of the episode" [...] was the radio scene, in which [...] "we get the impression that [...] are immature, simple-minded idiots." [...] Brett Love of TV Squad reviewed the episode slightly more negatively, stating that [...] "the whole Peter story just didn't <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> me." [...] Love did find that the [...] "Stewie and Brian stuff was {{the best part of the}} episode," [...] but went on to proclaim that [...] "there are 20 more episodes to get it right." [...] In his review of the Family Guy Volume 5 box set, Francis Rizzo of DVD Talk wrote that the radio subplot is [...] "a perfect parody of everything that's wrong in radio." ...|$|E

500|$|Goergen {{found the}} sound design unmemorable, {{saying that the}} music does not add much and that players {{would be likely to}} mute the game after hearing the [...] "beeping" [...] sound effect used for {{dialogue}} for too long. Meanwhile, Ponce and Petit liked it: Ponce called the score [...] "masterful" [...] and said that it [...] "gets under your skin at the right moments", while Petit said that she appreciated the sound, which she called atmospheric and [...] " [...] shivers up your spine". She was unimpressed with the environments, but said that they were clear and easy to look at. She liked the character portraits, calling them expressive and, paired with the dialogue, enough to make the player not care about the lack of voice acting. Ponce, too, felt that the game did not need voice acting. He felt that the way the game favored textual narration over animated cutscenes made it more immersive, allowing the player to imagine the scenes. Goergen said that the graphics were well done, but that they did not <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> the atmosphere. Kaplan called the presentation [...] "awesome", saying that it looked great and that the artwork stood on its own despite the simplicity of the animations, and that the soundtrack was [...] "fantastic".|$|E
500|$|Brett Love of TV Squad {{posited that}} Gordon's {{return in the}} [...] "great" [...] episode was [...] "well worth the wait". He noted that the revelation that Lucy was just an {{innocent}} girl was a [...] "nice twist", and deemed it a [...] "great choice" [...] to have Gordon turned into a vampire. Love was sad to see Gordon depart from the series, finding the [...] "outstanding" [...] Brown to be [...] "so intense and committed" [...] to the role. However, he considered Bela's appearance to be unnecessary, and pointed out the implausibility of it being easier for Gordon to track down Bela {{than it would have}} been to just track down the Winchesters. Like Love, Julie Pyle of Airlock Alpha believed Bela's appearance [...] " [...] forced". She was saddened by the deaths of Gordon and Kubrick, and had hoped that their storylines would have been further explored. Pyle also criticized the episode's lighting, commenting, [...] "With the added gore this season, the show should seem darker. Instead, it's like Supernatural Lite." [...] While Maureen Ryan of Chicago Tribune found the concept of Gordon hunting down Sam to be [...] "inspired", she noted that [...] "'Fresh Blood' didn't <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> [...] ".|$|E

In 1869, the library moved to the Ladd & Tilton Bank Building where it received free rent. Deady was the president from 1874 until 1893, and found that fundraising was [...] "like pulling teeth", calling the local establishment [...] "closefisted narrow visioned millionaires" [...] in 1888, also stating [...] "The rich men of Portland will never <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> [...] until they die, and maybe not then."

Shortly after its release, Harrison described [...] "Maybe I'm Amazed" [...] and [...] "That Would Be Something" [...] as [...] "great", but the rest, he said, [...] "just don't <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> me". Harrison added that, unlike Lennon, Starr and himself, McCartney was probably too [...] "isolated" [...] from other musicians, such that: [...] "The only person he's {{got to tell}} him if the song's good or bad is Linda." [...] In a December 1970 interview with Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner, Lennon dismissed McCartney as [...] "rubbish" [...] and expressed a belief that his primal therapy-inspired album John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band would [...] "probably scare [...] into doing something decent".|$|E

2500|$|Beginning circa 1950, Ferrer {{concentrated}} on film work, but {{would return to}} the stage occasionally. In 1959 Ferrer directed the original stage production of Saul Levitt's The Andersonville Trial, about the trial following the revelation of conditions at the infamous Civil War prison. It was a hit and featured George C. Scott. He took over the direction of the troubled musical Juno from Vincent J. Donehue, who had himself taken over from Tony Richardson. The show folded after 16 performances and mixed-to extremely negative critical reaction. The show's commercial failure (along with his earlier flop, Oh, Captain!), was a considerable setback to Ferrer's directing career. Nor did the short-lived The Girl Who Came to Supper <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> his acting career. A notable performance of his later stage career was as Miguel de Cervantes and his fictional creation Don Quixote in the hit musical Man of La Mancha. Ferrer took over the role from Richard Kiley in 1966 and subsequently went on tour with it in the first national company of the show. Tony Martinez continued in the role of Sancho Panza under Ferrer, as he had with Kiley. [...] During the Bicentennial, Ferrer narrated the world premiere of Michael Jeffrey Shapiro's A Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776 for narrator and orchestra with the Philharmonic Symphony of Westchester, Martin Rich, conductor.|$|E
