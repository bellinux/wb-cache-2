5|$|The {{country has}} {{developed}} into a centre of Islamic banking, and is {{the country with the}} highest numbers of female workers in that industry. Knowledge-based services are also expanding. To create a self-reliant defensive ability and support national development, Malaysia privatised some of its military facilities in the 1970s. The privatisation has created <b>defence</b> <b>industry,</b> which in 1999 was brought under the Malaysia <b>Defence</b> <b>Industry</b> Council. The government continues to promote this sector and its competitiveness, actively marketing the <b>defence</b> <b>industry.</b> Science policies in Malaysia are regulated by the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation. The country is one of the world's largest exporters of semiconductor devices, electrical devices, and IT and communication products. Malaysia began developing its own space programme in 2002, and in 2006, Russia agreed to transport one Malaysian to the International Space Station as part of a multibillion-dollar purchase of 18 Russian Sukhoi Su-30MKM fighter jets by the Royal Malaysian Air Force. The government has invested in building satellites in through the RazakSAT programme.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, {{bilateral}} ties were characterised {{by trade}} and economic co-operation; {{other areas of}} bilateral co-operation were explored from 2000 onwards. In that year, Vietnam and Malaysia reached an agreement on bilateral efforts on law enforcement and suppressing the trans-national drug trade. In 2004, three Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) {{in the areas of}} information technology, education and diplomatic ties, and co-operation-in-general were signed. Bilateral co-operation between both countries was also extended to defence matters in 2008 when another MoU was signed, which proposed for joint military trainings and collaboration in the <b>defence</b> <b>industry</b> between the Malaysian and Vietnamese militaries. The MoU also provided for the navies of both countries to prevent Vietnamese fishermen from encroaching into Malaysian waters for fishing activities as well as to control piracy.|$|E
5|$|The Collins {{class is}} an {{enlarged}} {{version of the}} Kockums Västergötland class submarine. The design {{was referred to as}} the Type 471 Submarine until it was decided to name the lead boat, HMAS Collins, after RAN Vice Admiral Sir John Augustine Collins. The names of the six submarines was first announced during Collins laying down ceremony: Collins, Farncomb, Waller, Dechaineux, Sheean, and Rankin; all named after Australian naval personnel who distinguished themselves during World War II. The Collins-class submarines are classified by the RAN as SSGs, or guided missile carrying submarines, although some <b>defence</b> <b>industry</b> websites refer to the boats as hunter-killer submarines, or SSKs.|$|E
5|$|Kirilenko {{was seen}} as a {{possible}} candidate for the post of First Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in 1977, however, First World observers tended to overrate the significance of the office, and because of it, their observation were completely off the mark. Vasili Kuznetsov, a 76-year-old man, was chosen to the office of First Deputy Chairman instead. During Brezhnev's later rule, KGB chairman Yuri Andropov gradually took over the functions and, eventually, Kirilenko's position within the Soviet leadership. In 1979, Kirilenko lost his unofficial office as supervisor of the <b>defence</b> <b>industry</b> over to Pavel Finogenov, a protegé of Dmitriy Ustinov. Kirilenko {{was seen as}} a key candidate by the West to replace Brezhnev as Soviet leader in 1982. After Brezhnev's death, Kirilenko was removed from the ruling Politburo by the new General Secretary Andropov. With his deteriorating health, having a disease known as arteriosclerosis, Kirilenko was disabled from ensuing active politics or protecting himself from Andropov's attacks. After Brezhnev's death and funeral, Kirilenko's mental condition deteriorated to where he could not remember the names of several leading Politburo members. He was unable to write properly during his later life; when asked by Andropov to write a letter of resignation in 1982, he was unable to do so. The decision to remove Kirilenko was taken before Andropov rose to power, so in the event Brezhnev had died later, Kirilenko would still have been forced to resign. The reason for the decision was that Kirilenko's son had tried to defect to the United Kingdom.|$|E
