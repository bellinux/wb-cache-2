The {{heightened}} perception induced by the hallucinogen inspired both musicians in their subsequent work with the Beatles, notably on the albums Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), and led directly to a shared interest in Eastern philosophical concepts and meditation. Harrison later said of the profound change he felt {{as a result of}} first taking the drug: [...] "I had such an overwhelming feeling of well-being, that there was a God, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> in every blade of grass. It was like gaining hundreds of years of experience within twelve hours. It changed me, {{and there was no way}} back to what I was before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, mother----Mother, I must let Mr. Trafford {{know that}} I'm {{not to see}} him. I can't {{suddenly}} cease.... If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> once----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wouldn't trust him, not 'alf {{as far as}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> {{though he}} was twice my father." [...] This again came from Mr. Hart.|$|E
60|$|Warn. How {{the devil}} got he here before me! 'Tis very unlucky <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>him</b> first.|$|R
60|$|That settled it. That's {{the police}} all over, and that's 'ow {{they get their}} way and do as they like. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>'im</b> in my mind's eye talking to the guv'nor, and letting out little things about broken glasses and such-like by accident. I drew back to let 'im pass, and I was so upset that when that little rat of a {{landlord}} follered 'im I didn't say a word.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's {{all very}} well to say that, but I have some heart. I love <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>him</b> starve. Think what he might be with Â£20,000 a-year!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, ma'am, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> well enough. He was talkin' an' laughin', {{as far as}} I {{could make}} out, with an {{uncommon}} pretty girl." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Oural Mountains! {{that is out}} of reach. I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> One {{might find}} some means of {{clearing}} him. What directed your suspicion to Maddox?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh HIM!' rejoined Mark, {{with an air}} of {{careless}} defiance. 'Yes, I see HIM. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> {{a little}} better, if he'd shave himself, and get his hair cut.' ...|$|E
60|$|The boarder was {{standing}} in the middle of the dining-room, into which the stairs led. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> but <b>I</b> put my hand against him as I was feeling my way across the floor.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>him</b> for {{the tears}} which his earnestness and goodness, so adorned by, and so adorning, the perfect {{simplicity}} of his manner, brought into my eyes. He {{had moved to}} the door, when he added: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's Peterson's Troupe," [...] {{said the}} other. [...] "I was {{on when they}} come in last week. One of 'em was dead in his box, and from what <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> of <b>him</b> it looked mighty like he'd had the tar knocked outa him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would know}} him as far as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> just by his tail alone," [...] exclaimed Johnny. [...] "I don't know of any other tail at all like it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go upstairs!" [...] I {{whispered to}} her. She shook her head. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> taking heavy breaths, and the veins {{of his neck}} were swelling. I was furious at her disobedience.|$|E
60|$|How frightened he was! Yet how {{still he}} sat! Whenever I took my eyes from {{him a moment}} I had to hunt again, {{sometimes}} two or three minutes, before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> there.|$|E
60|$|Because, I mean to say, {{there was}} no {{possibility}} of error. He wasn't singing. As I approached, he gave an encore, and it was beyond question a groan. Moreover, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> now <b>see</b> <b>him</b> clearly, and his whole aspect was definitely sand-bagged.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank Heaven {{he is in}} his bed; {{having been}} up all night, as you know, and on his feet all day. He was quite tired out. Ah, neighbour, if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> but <b>see</b> <b>him</b> oftener so--if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> but tame down that terrible restlessness--' ...|$|R
60|$|Leaning {{over the}} side, with {{two pairs of}} gloves on, I caught the double line, and as I pulled and Dan reeled the fish came up nearer. But <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> Then <b>I</b> reached the leader and held on as for dear life.|$|R
6000|$|... "A brave life, Uncle, {{and full}} of excitement. The minutes in that cage must be splendid. I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> once!" [...] cried Rose, with the restless {{look in her eyes}} again.|$|E
6000|$|... "I must go, Abijah. There {{is nothing}} else for me to do. Do you think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> after {{treating}} him as I have done? I should fall dead at his feet for shame." ...|$|E
60|$|Uncle Ebenezer {{went and}} looked {{out of the window}} for awhile. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> all {{trembling}} and twitching, like a man with palsy. But when he turned round, he had a smile upon his face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sometimes, {{toward the}} end, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> three of <b>him</b> {{in the ring}} at once, an' I wouldn't know which to hit an' which to duck....|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{wanted it}} very much. He {{had gone away}} a ruined man because of his gambling; and now, when he had come back and was to be put upon his legs again, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>him</b> again ruined for the need of such a sum. It was very foolish." ...|$|R
6000|$|The man, who {{had opened}} the door only a few inches, kept in the background, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> nothing of <b>him,</b> but I heard his grim, monosyllable reply: ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{the king}} said: 'If only <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> once more, {{and if it}} turned out that after all he was a man and not a god, I would reward him with half my kingdom.' ...|$|E
60|$|But it {{was plain}} that they meant nothing should delay their shot. They had never {{so much as}} looked at their fallen comrade, though he was not dead, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> trying to crawl away.|$|E
60|$|Uncle Ebenezer {{went and}} looked {{out of the window}} for a while. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> all {{trembling}} and twitching, like a man with palsy. But when he turned round, he had a smile upon his face.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am your brother,' {{replied the}} stranger, 'and I have {{returned}} home without the money I {{hoped to have}} made. And, what is worse, they tell me in the village that my father is dead. I would have counted my lost gold as nothing if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> once more.' ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the dimness}} {{of the landing}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>him</b> very well, but there was {{something}} in his voice that surprised me. I knew he was of abstemious habit or I should have thought he had been drinking. I led the way into my sitting room and asked him to sit down.|$|R
6000|$|... "My orders are--" [...] the gendarme resumed; {{but already}} my {{sensitive}} ear had detected a faint wavering in the gruffness of his voice. The hectoring tone {{had gone out}} of it. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> of course, but somehow I felt that his attitude had become less arrogant and his glance more shifty.|$|R
60|$|That {{evening after}} dinner Tom came in alone, and I {{suspected}} that Perry had sent him. He was fidgety, ill at ease, and presently asked if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> {{a moment in}} my study. Maude's glance followed us.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{guess there}} is," [...] said Hannah. [...] "I {{used to think}} that that Wiley was low enough, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> It was some satisfaction. I could know the worst, anyhow.... I guess it's about time for another flood." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Colonel declined. [...] "I {{have long}} had the House of Commons in my eye," [...] he said; [...] "but not for me. I wanted my boy to go there. It {{would be a}} proud day for me if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> there." ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{gave him}} a nice burial even tho [...] I am a widow with $90.00 per month to pay for it. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>him</b> buried in Potter's field... I know his soul is in heaven with God and I will meet him someday ... Letter to the prison {{chaplain}} from the mother of James W. Rodgers ...|$|R
60|$|When {{at length}} {{we reached the}} outspan I asked the Hottentot, Klaus, who was {{assisting}} me to drive the team, where his master was, for <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>him</b> anywhere. He answered that he had gone back down the kloof to look for something that had fallen from the wagon, a bolt I think he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think he}} was glad of it. Clearly indeed he was. He stayed {{a quarter of an}} hour. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that for <b>him</b> it was long. He's interested," [...] said Mrs. Stringham.|$|R
