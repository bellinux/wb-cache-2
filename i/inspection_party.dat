5|$|By early 1943, with Radford's {{training}} programs established and functioning efficiently, he sought combat duty. In April of that year, {{he was ordered}} to report to the office of Commander, Naval Air Forces, Pacific Fleet where he was promoted to rear admiral and tapped to be a carrier division commander. This was an unusual appointment, as most carrier division commanders were appointed only after duty commanding a capital ship. He then spent May and June 1943 on an <b>inspection</b> <b>party</b> under Gates, touring U.S. bases in the south Pacific. Following this, he was assigned under Rear Admiral Frederick C. Sherman, commander of Carrier Division 2 at Pearl Harbor. Radford spent several weeks observing flight operations and carrier tactics for various ships operating out of Hawaii. He was particularly impressed with how carrier doctrine had evolved in the time since his own assignment on a carrier, and in June 1943, {{he was ordered to}} observe operations on the light aircraft carrier , learning the unique challenges of using light carriers.|$|E
25|$|Seeadler left port on 21 December 1916 {{and managed}} to slip through the British {{blockade}} disguised as a Norwegian ship. Many of the crew of six officers and 57 men, including Luckner himself, had been selected {{for their ability to}} speak Norwegian, in case they were intercepted by the British. By Christmas Day, Seeadler was southeast of Iceland, where she encountered the British armed merchant cruiser Avenger. Avenger put an <b>inspection</b> <b>party</b> aboard, but failed to detect the German deception.|$|E
500|$|In July 1913, Lane {{left on a}} long {{inspection}} tour of National Parks, Indian reservations, {{and other}} areas under the Interior Department's jurisdiction. [...] Fearful that local employees would control what {{he was allowed to}} see, he sent an assistant to visit each site and provide him with a complete report on it two weeks in advance of his arrival. The tour was interrupted in August, when President Wilson asked his Interior Secretary to go to Denver and serve as his representative at the Conference of Governors. Lane did, and then rejoined his <b>inspection</b> <b>party</b> in San Francisco. After several days of meetings there, he collapsed because of an attack of angina pectoris. After three weeks recuperating, he returned to Washington against medical advice to resume his work.|$|E

2500|$|The war {{records of}} the {{submarine}} chaser PC-1264 and the destroyer escort USS Mason considerably contributed to opening up billets for African Americans in the post-war navy. As a final honor for the PC-1264, the officer-in-charge of the final <b>inspection</b> <b>party</b> remarked, [...] "This ship has {{done a better job}} of decommissioning—is in better shape—than any other ship, at least, here in New York."

2500|$|One of {{the more}} notable skirmishes between American and Communist forces {{became known as the}} Kuyeh Incident. On November 14, a train {{carrying}} General Dewitt Peck, 7th Marines, and an <b>inspection</b> <b>party</b> consisting of Marines was fired on near the village of Kuyeh, while it was traveling from Tangshan to Chinwangtao. An indecisive battle ensued. For over three hours the Marines exchanged fire with the Communists, who were positioned around the village, about 500 yards north of the railroad tracks. Chinese fire from the village was so intense at one point the Americans called in air support. However, because the Marine aircraft could not clearly identify enemy targets, and because there was a risk of harming innocent civilians, permission to open fire was not given. Therefore, the aircraft flew over the Communists, but they did not actually fire on them. Later that day, a company from the 7th Marines was sent to reinforce the ambushed train. Men of the company found that the resistance had [...] "melted away," [...] so General Peck's train proceeded into Kuyeh after nightfall. There were no casualties among the Marines. Chinese casualties, if any, are unknown.|$|E

5000|$|At 11:15 {{hours on}} 5 August 1917, an aide {{from the office}} of the Commandant, 4th Naval District, arrived at Vidofners dock and {{requested}} that she make ready to get underway at once. Accordingly, an <b>inspection</b> <b>party</b> boarded Vidofner and she headed downstream toward the troop transport USS Henderson (Transport No. 1), which had run aground earlier that day. Early on 6 August, after the <b>inspection</b> <b>party</b> had been transferred to the stranded troopship, Vidofner headed back to the navy yard and relieved the patrol boat [...] on patrol at 08:00 hours. Two hours later, Vidofner stopped the tug Sam Weller near a restricted area and ordered her out. When the tug failed to comply quickly enough, Vidofner fired two shots in the air, which was sufficient prodding to hurry Sam Weller on her way.|$|E

5000|$|Third-party {{inspection}} or [...] "Category A" [...] is {{the most}} stringent of the 3 categories of inspection organization that the standard specifies.
