This information can be used to monitor skill development among EU countries while comparing its progress with the agreed target and EU average performance. A preliminary list of indicators is proposed based on data availability. Some discussion on their appropriateness is also presented in line with the <b>Joint</b> <b>Assessment</b> <b>Framework</b> methodology (JAF). The conceptual framework and approach build upon the work of OECD et al. (2013) in developing indicators of skills in the context of developing countries. JRC.

40|$|This {{technical}} report represents the official guide to DG EAC’s <b>Joint</b> <b>Assessment</b> <b>Framework</b> (JAF). The JAF methodology {{was first introduced}} by DG EMPL in 2010 to standardise the monitoring of benchmarks and indicators under the Employment Guidelines. Since two of the Employment Guidelines concern education and training, DG EAC was directly involved in developing the methodology and has since introduced it into its own monitoring approach concerning the strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training (ET 2020). The JRC’s Centre for Research on Education and Lifelong Learning (CRELL) has helped EAC to adapt the JAF to the context of education and training, developing the quantitative part of the methodology for the ET 2020 benchmarks. This report details the main empirical, theoretical and policy arguments behind {{the selection of the}} various sub-groups and sub-indicators for each of the six operational ET 2020 benchmarks; it also lists the methodological criteria adopted throughout the JAF development work. Finally, the report provides explanations on how to interpret the JAF charts that are produced annually by CRELL for the quantitative assessment. JRC.

In this paper, we first derive a new result for optimal policymaking under uncertainty. It consists of two components: one of a unilateral policy reaction under certainty, which is then multiplied by a scale factor, reflecting the uncertainty over the impact coefficient concerned with respect {{to those of the}} other policy variables. Based on this finding, we use a large multi-country labour market model, estimated in Bassanini and Duval (2006), to derive and discuss the various employment policy interventions and relevant labour market indicators to be monitored in the EU's <b>Joint</b> <b>Assessment</b> <b>Framework</b> (JAF). As the derived optimal labour market policy entails streamlining welfare benefits and may thus jeopardise the other target of inclusion in the EU 2020 process, we then discuss and evaluate how the distributional consequences of such a policy can be mitigated through transfer and tax changes. It turns out that compensation of the losers is possible {{in such a way that}} all will gain, and employment, GDP and aggregate labour supply will all rise...|$|E
40|$|The {{highway bridge}} {{infrastructure}} system within the United States is rapidly deteriorating {{and a significant}} percentage of these bridges are approaching the end of their useful service life. Deterioration mechanisms affect the load resisting capacity of critical structural components and render aging highway bridges more vulnerable to earthquakes compared to pristine structures.

40|$|The {{systematic}} {{inclusion of}} information on orientation of study (vocational vs. general) in the Labour Force Survey (LFS) starting from 2014 will give the possibility to analyse the features and the labour market outcomes of individuals depending on the programme orientation of their qualification. One of the main purposes of this technical briefing is to investigate the possible impact of the addition of this information {{in the context of}} the <b>Joint</b> <b>Assessment</b> <b>Framework</b> (JAF) approach, in particular with reference to the benchmark on the employment rate of recent graduates. In this perspective, orientation of study appears to be a natural candidate for inclusion among the additional sub-groups concerning the employment rate of recent graduates within the JAF methodology. The analysis carried out in the briefing shows a labour market advantage, at least in the short run, of young individuals with VET qualifications (compared to their non-VET counterparts), although with important cross-country differences. However, {{in the context of the}} JAF approach, the current data availability would not allow programme orientation to work in the same way as other JAF sub-groups, thus the recommendation is to add the VET/non-VET distinction within one of the sub-groups of the benchmark, i. e. the already existing level of education.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{technical}} brief is to investigate the comparability between two early childhood education and care indicators currently used by the European Commission – namely the Barcelona target and the ET 2020 ECEC benchmark – and to identify methodological differences and common traits that may have implications in their use for policy-making. Results show that, despite being potentially similar measures of participation of children in early childhood education and care in the different countries, they are essentially different in their nature as they cover different groups of individuals. Additionally, {{the fact that they}} use different datasets, namely administrative data from UOE and survey data from EU-SILC, implies that they follow diverse data collection protocols; in particular, the use of EU-SILC survey data brings the risk of not having a fully representative sample of the children population; and exposes data to respondent and interviewer’s biases, which further contributes to the existing differences between them. Notwithstanding, results provided in the brief suggest that the different age composition of the two indicators could explain a consistent part of the difference in the overall shares; in the majority of countries, for age groups 4 and 5, numbers are quite similar. Thus, while still taking into account all the caveats explained in this document, we could conclude that for these age groups results could be equally used for policy support. Some suggestions for the improvement of the Barcelona target sub-indicator for the ET 2020 ECEC benchmark within the <b>Joint</b> <b>Assessment</b> <b>Framework</b> are also proposed. JRC.

40|$|The {{highway bridge}} {{infrastructure}} system within the United States is rapidly deteriorating {{and a significant}} percentage of these bridges are approaching the end of their useful service life. Deterioration mechanisms affect the load resisting capacity of critical structural components and render aging highway bridges more vulnerable to earthquakes compared to pristine structures. While past literature has traditionally neglected the simultaneous consideration of seismic and aging threats to highway bridges, a <b>joint</b> fragility <b>assessment</b> <b>framework</b> is needed to evaluate the impact of deterioration mechanisms on bridge vulnerability during earthquakes. This research aims to offer an efficient methodology for accurate estimation of the seismic fragility of aging highway bridges. In addition to aging, which is a predominant threat that affects lifetime seismic reliability, other stressors such as repeated seismic events or simultaneous presence of truck traffic are also incorporated in the seismic fragility analysis. The impact of deterioration mechanisms on bridge component responses are assessed for a range of exposure conditions following the nonlinear dynamic analysis of three-dimensional high-fidelity finite element aging bridge models. Subsequently, time-dependent fragility curves are developed at the bridge component and system level to assess the probability of structural damage given the earthquake intensity. In addition to highlighting the importance of accounting for deterioration mechanisms, these time-evolving fragility curves are used within an improved seismic loss estimation methodology to aid in efficient channeling of monetary resources for structural retrofit or seismic upgrade. Further, statistical learning methods are employed to derive flexible parameterized fragility models conditioned on earthquake hazard intensity, bridge design parameters, and deterioration affected structural parameters to provide significant improvements over traditional fragility models and aid in efficient estimation of aging bridge vulnerabilities. In order to facilitate bridge management decision making, a methodology is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed multi-dimensional fragility models to estimate the in-situ aging bridge reliabilities with field-measurement data across a transportation network. Finally, this research proposes frameworks to offer guidance to risk analysts regarding the importance of accounting for supplementary threats stemming from multiple seismic shocks along the service life of the bridge structures and the presence of truck traffic atop the bridge deck during earthquake events...|$|R

40|$|Aims and objectives: To {{evaluate}} structured patient <b>assessment</b> <b>frameworks</b> 2 ̆ 7 {{impact on}} patient care. Background: Accurate patient assessment {{is imperative to}} determine the status {{and needs of the}} patient and the delivery of appropriate patient care. Nurses must be highly skilled in conducting timely and accurate patient assessments to overcome environmental obstacles and deliver quality and safe patient care. A structured approach to patient assessment is widely accepted in everyday clinical practice, yet {{little is known about the}} impact structured patient <b>assessment</b> <b>frameworks</b> have on patient care. Design: Integrative review. Methods: An electronic database search was conducted using Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System, PubMed and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. The reference sections of textbooks and journal articles on patient assessment were manually searched for further studies. A comprehensive peer review screening process was undertaken. Research studies were selected that evaluated the impact structured patient <b>assessment</b> <b>frameworks</b> have on patient care. Studies were included if frameworks were designed for use by paramedics, nurses or medical practitioners working in prehospital or acute in-hospital settings. Results: Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria. There were no studies that evaluate the impact of a generic nursing <b>assessment</b> <b>framework</b> on patient care. The use of a structured patient <b>assessment</b> <b>framework</b> improved clinician performance of patient assessment. Limited evidence was found to support other aspects of patient care including documentation, communication, care implementation, patient and clinician satisfaction, and patient outcomes. Conclusion: Structured patient <b>assessment</b> <b>frameworks</b> enhance clinician performance of patient assessment and hold the potential to improve patient care and outcomes; however, further research is required to address these evidence gaps, particularly in nursing. Relevance to clinical practice: Acute care clinicians should consider using structured patient <b>assessment</b> <b>frameworks</b> in clinical practice to enhance their performance of patient assessment. </span...|$|R

40|$|The Department of Health's (2000) <b>Framework</b> for the <b>Assessment</b> of Children in Need and Their Families [Assessment Framework] {{represents}} {{the most significant}} attempt to aid social work decision making in the UK currently. Its overriding objective is to improve outcomes for children in need through effective assessment and decision making. Yet, since its introduction in April 2000, no empirical {{research has been conducted}} exploring {{the ways in which the}} <b>Assessment</b> <b>Framework</b> helps social workers in the decision making process. Clearly, if the <b>Assessment</b> <b>Framework</b> is not effective in helping social workers reach decisions, it may not be effective in achieving better outcomes for children in need. This thesis therefore explores the impact of the <b>Assessment</b> <b>Framework</b> on social workers' decision making practice. Documentary analysis of 98 core assessment records in four local authorities was used as a means to reconstruct social workers' cognitive decision making processes and the role of the <b>Assessment</b> <b>Framework</b> within these processes. Follow-up semi structured interviews were carried out with the 50 social workers responsible for completing these core assessments. Particular attention was given to investigating the effects of case, individual and environmental characteristics on participants' decision making strategies and use of the <b>Assessment</b> <b>Framework</b> in order to identify factors that facilitated or obstructed the integration of this tool in practice. The resulting qualitative data was used to reconstruct a trace of the decision making process and to explore any potential causal factors affecting this process. Tests of association and cluster analysis were then employed as a means of exploring these causal connections further. Due to the complex way in which the relevant causal factors interacted Qualitative Comparative Analysis was also used as a method for understanding the causal mechanisms affecting social workers' decision making processes. The findings reveal variations in social work decision making strategies and in the use of the <b>Assessment</b> <b>Framework</b> associated with a range of case, environmental and individual characteristics. Participants identified strengths and weaknesses in the use of the <b>Assessment</b> <b>Framework</b> and confirmed that the <b>Assessment</b> <b>Framework</b> does not always fit with the way in which social workers approach assessment and decision-making.

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades many {{countries}} and regions throughout the world have taken steps to establish Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs). Developing SDIs requires a considerable amount of time, energy and financial resources. Therefore it is increasingly important to assess SDI outcomes in order to justify the resources spent on those infrastructures. The main objective of this thesis is to develop a framework for assessing Spatial Data Infrastructures. This thesis achieves this main objective in four sub objectives. First, for the reason that SDI complexity is seen as a serious obstacle for its comprehensive assessment, this thesis analyses SDI complexity by determining whether SDI can be viewed as Complex Adaptive System (CAS). Second, the principles of assessing CAS and the norms of general evaluation theory {{serve as the basis for}} developing a Multi-view SDI <b>assessment</b> <b>framework.</b> Third, the thesis evaluates the application process and applicability of the Multi-view SDI <b>assessment</b> <b>framework</b> to assess SDIs by applying it in 21 National SDIs. Fourth, the thesis expands the Multi-view SDI <b>assessment</b> <b>framework</b> by adding an assessment view for a goal-oriented SDI assessment. The thesis results show that SDI can be viewed as Complex Adaptive System (CAS). The principles of assessing CAS serve as a basis for developing a Multi-view SDI <b>assessment</b> <b>framework</b> which allows for a more comprehensive and less biased SDI assessment.
