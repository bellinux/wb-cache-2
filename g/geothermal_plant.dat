5|$|Electricity {{interconnection}} between Sabah, the Indonesian {{province of}} North Kalimantan and the Philippine province of Palawan {{are also in}} the process as part of the BIMP-EAGA; with the interconnection with Palawan is expected to be completed in 2018. Since 2007, there is an attempt to establish a coal power plant in Lahad Datu which receiving opposition from local residents and non-governmental organisations for the pollution that would be caused by the plant. Thus Sabah has start to exploring alternative ways to generate electricity with the usage of renewable energy such as solar, mini hydro, biomass, geothermal and micro-algae and tidal technologies. The Japanese government has extended aid totalling RM172,190.93 for the solar electrification project in the island of Larapan in Sabah's east coast in 2010. In 2016, Malaysia's first <b>geothermal</b> <b>plant</b> was started to be developed in Tawau to boost electricity in the east coast after a research by United States GeothermEx Inc. and Jacobs New Zealand indicated the existence of an active geothermal system centred around the flanks of Mount Maria on Apas Kiri. A South Korean company GS Caltex also sets to built Malaysia's first bio-butanol plant in the state.|$|E

500|$|Iselle brought {{damaging}} surf {{along the}} east coast of the island. Strong winds unroofed homes near Hilo and downed trees. These winds also felled power lines, causing widespread outages impacting roughly 23,000electricity customers. A <b>geothermal</b> <b>plant</b> in Puna released toxic hydrogen sulfide gases upon losing its power sources, prompting officials to urge an exodus of the immediate area, although a number of nearby residents reported health impacts. A water treatment plant in Kula on Maui also shut down due to power failure, prompting the conservation of water supplies in that area. Iselle's winds also damaged about 1,000 coffee trees and over 2,000 macadamia trees. Damage was heaviest to the papaya crop, with about 60% of the statewide crop destroyed, accounting for $55million in losses (2014USD). Other crops, including coffee, macadamia nuts, and flowers, were also damaged, and overall crop losses in the state were estimated at $66million (2014USD). Only one known death took place {{as a direct result of}} the storm [...] a 19-year-old woman who was swept away by flood waters while hiking in a closed state park. Over 250property owners reported damage, with at least 11houses destroyed, and 28 with major damage. Public damage and the cost to remove debris was estimated at $13.2million. Overall damage in the state is unknown, but estimated by a Hawaiian economist between $148325million (2014USD).|$|E
