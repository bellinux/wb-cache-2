25|$|In the Henry {{system of}} classification, {{there are three}} basic {{fingerprint}} patterns: loop, whorl, and arch, which constitute 60–65%, 30–35%, and 5% of all fingerprints respectively. There are also more complex classification systems that break down patterns even further, into plain arches or tented arches, and into loops that may be radial or ulnar, depending {{on the side of}} the <b>hand</b> <b>toward</b> which the tail points. Ulnar loops start on the pinky-side of the finger, the side closer to the ulna, the lower arm bone. Radial loops start on the thumb-side of the finger, the side closer to the radius. Whorls may also have sub-group classifications including plain whorls, accidental whorls, double loop whorls, peacock's eye, composite, and central pocket loop whorls.|$|E
25|$|All five {{versions}} of the picture are of roughly the same large size (2.6 x 2.2 m). Bonaparte appears mounted in the uniform of a general in chief, wearing a gold-trimmed bicorne, and armed with a Mamluk-style sabre. He is wreathed {{in the folds of}} a large cloak which billows in the wind. His head is turned towards the viewer, and he gestures with his right <b>hand</b> <b>toward</b> the mountain summit. His left hand grips the reins of his steed. The horse rears up on its back legs, its mane and tail whipped against its body by the same wind that inflates Napoleon's cloak. In background a line of the soldiers interspersed with artillery make their way up the mountain. Dark clouds hang over the picture and in front of Bonaparte the mountains rise up sharply. In the foreground BONAPARTE, HANNIBAL and KAROLVS MAGNVS IMP. are engraved on rocks. On the breastplate yoke of the horse, the picture is signed and dated.|$|E

500|$|Though it was {{initially}} feared {{he would not}} survive his injuries, Bailey recovered enough {{to participate in the}} benefit game. He presented gifts and shook the hands of each player as they were introduced. Among them was Eddie Shore himself, who was playing for the NHL all-stars. [...] The crowd fell silent as Shore approached, then erupted into loud cheering when Bailey extended his <b>hand</b> <b>toward</b> his attacker. The Maple Leafs announced during the ceremonies that no player on their team would again wear Bailey's number 6, marking the first time in NHL history that a team retired a player's uniform number.|$|E
500|$|Set {{prior to}} most of the film's action, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] is the second proper song in The Little Mermaid, and takes place in Ariel's grotto before she meets Eric. A {{character}} song used to progress the plot, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] resembles a monologue in which Ariel expresses her desire {{to become part of the}} human world while reveling in her expansive collection of discarded human items and artifacts. Singing about her interest in exploring the human world and learning as much as she can about it, Ariel performs the ballad while gazing up towards the surface longingly, wishing that she could be human herself and live among other humans. [...] "Part of Your World" [...] reveals that Ariel feels repressed and unhappy in her current environment despite her belongings and royal lineage, [...] "want to be a part of something else." [...] A wind-up toy resembling a woman dancing is used to demonstrate that Ariel would much rather be like her. The character also sings the line [...] "What’s a fire and why does it ... What’s the word? Burn!” to Georges de La Tour's painting Magdalene with the Smoking Flame to indicate a similar sentiment. Offering character development, the song explores and voices the inner goings-on of Ariel's mind. Ariel's craving for adventure makes it difficult for the character to enjoy her current surroundings while knowing there is much left for her to explore, causing her to grow increasingly despondent; [...] "change", a non-physical concept that can not be purchased or stolen, is the only thing that could make her truly happy. In the meantime, Ariel uses material belongings to fill the void of what is missing from her life, attempting to live among humans vicariously via what she has salvaged from sunken ships. Voicing her frustration over being confined to the ocean, Ariel is not shy about what she wants, choosing to belt out her desires instead. The Animated Movie Guide author Jerry Beck wrote that the song [...] "capture's Ariel's yearning so intensely that when she extends her <b>hand</b> <b>toward</b> the surface we long to reach out with her", ending with Ariel gesturing while sighing longingly and descending back down to the ocean floor.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Jacob's sight had dimmed with age, so Joseph brought his sons near, and Jacob kissed them and embraced them. Jacob told Joseph {{that he had}} not thought to see his face, and now God had let him see his children, as well. Joseph took them from between his knees, bowed deeply, and brought them to Jacob, with Ephraim in his right <b>hand</b> <b>toward</b> Jacob's left hand, and Manasseh in his left <b>hand</b> <b>toward</b> Jacob's right hand. But Jacob laid his right hand on Ephraim, the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh, the firstborn, and prayed that God bless the lads, let Jacob's name be named in them, and let them grow into a multitude. The second reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E

2500|$|An {{authenticated}} video surfaced on the Internet {{that shows}} two gunmen {{and a police}} officer, Ahmed Merabet, who is wounded and lying on a sidewalk after an exchange of gunfire. This took place near the corner of Boulevard Richard-Lenoir and Rue Moufle, [...] east of the main crime scene. One of the gunmen ran towards the policeman and shouted, [...] "Did {{you want to kill}} us?" [...] The policeman answered, [...] "No, it's fine, boss", and raised his <b>hand</b> <b>toward</b> the gunman, who then gave the policeman a fatal shot to the head at close range.|$|E

2500|$|A {{very early}} image which is {{believed}} to be an early anti-Christian graffito is the Alexamenos graffito, a unique piece of wall graffiti near the Palatine hill in Rome. The inscription has been ascribed dates ranging from the 1st to the 3rd centuries AD. It was apparently drawn by a Roman soldier to mock another soldier who was a Christian. The caption reads, in Greek, [...] "Alexamenos worships [...] God", while the image shows a man raising his <b>hand</b> <b>toward</b> a crucified figure with a donkey's head. This seems to refer to a Roman misconception that the Jews worshipped a god with the form of a donkey, so that the image would be at once antisemitic and anti-Christian. A small minority of scholars dispute whether this image depicts Jesus, proposing that this image may be a reference to another deity.|$|E

2500|$|In , Magneto returns {{again as}} the main {{antagonist}} and has expanded the Brotherhood of Mutants with new recruits. After learning that a major company has produced a [...] "cure" [...] for the mutant gene, he and his Brotherhood attack the facility {{with the intention of}} killing the cure's source. Upon learning of Jean Grey's return, Magneto sets his concerns about the cure aside to sway Phoenix to his side; he succeeds, but is shaken when Phoenix vaporizes Xavier before his eyes. After Xavier's apparent demise, Magneto shows genuine grief over Xavier's death. During the Brotherhood's assault on Alcatraz, Magneto lifted and manipulated the Golden Gate Bridge and had no qualms about endangering or sacrificing dozens of his mutant followers by knowingly sending them against anti-mutant weapons while he remained safely out of range stating that [...] "in chess, the pawns go first." [...] During the final showdown, Wolverine and Beast work together and inject Magneto with the [...] "cure" [...] which strips him of his powers. From there, Magneto realizes his horror as Phoenix unleashes her fury on all sides of the conflict before fleeing. In the final scene, he extends his <b>hand</b> <b>toward</b> a metal chess piece and is able to slightly move it, indicating that his powers are returning.|$|E
2500|$|After the Meccans' withdrawal, Muhammad {{then led}} his forces against the Banu Qurayza neighborhood. According to Ibn Ishaq, {{he had been}} asked to do so by the angel Gabriel. The Banu Qurayza retreated into their stronghold and endured the siege for 25 days. As their morale waned, Ka'b ibn Asad {{suggested}} three alternative ways out of their predicament: embrace Islam; kill their own children and women, then rush out for a charge to either win or die; or make a surprise attack on the Sabbath. The Banu Qurayza accepted none of these alternatives. Instead they asked to confer with Abu Lubaba, one of their allies from the Aws. According to Ibn Ishaq, Abu Lubaba felt pity for the women and children of the tribe who were crying and when asked whether the Qurayza should surrender to Muhammad, advised them to do so. However he also [...] "made a sign with his <b>hand</b> <b>toward</b> his throat, indicating that [...] {{at the hands of the}} Prophet would be slaughter". The next morning, the Banu Qurayza surrendered and the Muslims seized their stronghold and their stores. The men - Ibn Ishaq numbers between 400 and 900 - were bound and placed under the custody of one Muhammad ibn Maslamah, who had killed Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf, while the women and children - numbering about 1,000 - were placed under Abdullah ibn Sallam, a former rabbi who had converted to Islam.|$|E
