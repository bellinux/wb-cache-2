5|$|Despite the defeat, the {{soldiers}} were received as heroes in Santiago. Thanks to Las Heras, a potential <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> patriot armies turned into a minor setback. The army was reorganized again, but the deaths, injuries and desertions caused by the defeat at Cancha Rayada reduced its size to 5,000 soldiers, which was closer to the royalist forces. They took position next to the Maipo River, near Santiago.|$|E
5|$|Ecgfrith succeeded Oswiu as king of Northumbria in 670. Soon after, the Picts rose in {{rebellion}} against Northumbrian subjugation at the Battle of Two Rivers, {{recorded in the}} 8th century by Stephen of Ripon, hagiographer of Wilfrid. Ecgfrith was aided by a sub-king, Beornhæth, {{who may have been}} a leader of the Southern Picts, and the rebellion ended in <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Northern Picts of Fortriu. Their king, Drest mac Donuel, was deposed and was replaced by Bridei mac Bili.|$|E

5|$|The 6th Division's next {{campaign}} was the failed Battle of Greece, a <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> British Commonwealth forces sent there. While in Greece, Mackay led a hastily assembled Australian-British-New Zealand-Greek formation known as Mackay Force, defending the Klidi Pass at the Battle of Vevi. The Allies {{were forced to}} retreat in a fierce assault by the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler brigade. Mackay was the only Australian general to face the Waffen-SS in battle.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} {{was composed}} of 20 warships, 21 frigates, and 32 transport ships, containing 800 cannons, 3,000 soldiers, and 10,000 marines. The expedition was to retake Louisbourg and then Annapolis Royal. However, after a three months crossing, and the dispersal of the fleet between Sable Island and the mainland, the expedition {{turned out to be}} a <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> French, and they would not try to recapture Port Royal again.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Romanian {{expeditionary force}} on the Eastern Front came at Stalingrad, where, during the Soviet counter-offensive of November 1942, the thinly spread forces of the Third Army (deployed north of Stalingrad) and of the Fourth Army (deployed south of Stalingrad) were attacked by vastly superior Soviet forces and suffered combined losses of some 158,000 personnel.|$|E

5|$|Unable {{to subdue}} Basarab, the king ordered the retreat through the mountains. But {{in a long}} and narrow valley, the Hungarian army was {{attacked}} by the Romanians, who had taken up positions on the heights. The battle, called the Battle of Posada, lasted for four days (November 9–12, 1330) and was a <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Hungarians whose defeat was devastating. The king was only able to escape with his life by exchanging his royal coat of arms {{with one of his}} retainers.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{royal decree}} of 1428, Louis I had also ordered that only Catholics be granted {{land in the}} Sebeş {{district}} of Timiş county. As a result of official pressure, many Romanian noblemen converted to Catholicism. For example, {{the members of the}} powerful Drágffy family turned Catholic in the 15thcentury. The Ottomans raided Transylvania {{for the first time in}} 1394. Sigismund I of Hungary (13871437) organized a crusade against them, but the battle of Nicopolis (now Nikopol, Bulgaria) ended in <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Christian forces in 1396.|$|E
5|$|Because of the South Vietnamese {{need for}} {{security}} which precluded thorough planning, an inability {{by the political}} and military leaders of the U.S. and South Vietnam to face military realities, and poor execution, Operation Lam Son 719 collapsed when faced by the determined resistance of a skillful foe. The campaign was a <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ARVN, demonstrating deficiencies in ARVN military leaders and that the best units of the ARVN could be defeated by PAVN and destroying the confidence that had been built up over the previous three years.|$|E

5|$|The American Revolutionary War, {{which began}} in April 1775 with the Battles of Lexington and Concord, widened in September 1775 when the Continental Army {{embarked}} on an invasion of the British Province of Quebec. The province was viewed by the Second Continental Congress as a potential avenue for British forces to attack and divide the rebellious colonies, and {{was at the time}} lightly defended. The invasion reached a peak on December 31, 1775, when the Battle of Quebec ended in <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Americans. In the spring of 1776, 10,000British and German troops arrived in Quebec, and General Guy Carleton, the provincial governor, drove the Continental Army out of Quebec and back to Fort Ticonderoga.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} a <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> French. According to {{unofficial}} accounts, they lost approximately 900men killed or drowned {{and at least}} 300wounded, {{in addition to the}} loss of a number of the newly constructed landing craft. In France the newly appointed Minister of Marine Étienne Eustache Bruix ordered a second attempt on the islands soon afterwards but the orders were immediately countermanded by the French Directory, which did not want the embarrassment of a second disastrous attack. Instead, Lacrosse gave orders for most of the surviving ships to be sent to Cherbourg, detachments later reaching Saint Malo and Granville. Muskein was ordered to return to Le Havre with the remainder.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} the last attempt by Indonesian forces to launch a major raid into Malaysian territory, and was a {{propaganda}} <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Indonesian government. Dissent grew in military and political circles, particularly over the perceived foolishness of incumbent President Sukarno in continuing the conflict, and on 30 September elements of the army revolted against him. Despite the speedy defeat of the rebels, Sukarno's rivals, particularly in the army, blamed the uprising on him and the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI). The conflict subsequently began to wind down, and a peace treaty ending the Confrontation was signed in August 1966. The increasingly unpopular Sukarno was forced to step down from office the next year.|$|E
50|$|Emperor Yuan was {{a renowned}} writer and {{collector}} of ancient books, but was criticized by historians for concentrating on eliminating potential contenders <b>for</b> <b>the</b> throne {{rather than on}} fighting Hou Jing. As Jiangling was sieged by Western Wei troops, Emperor Yuan set his {{collection of more than}} 140,000 volumes of ancient books on fire, and this is commonly considered as one of <b>the</b> greatest <b>disasters</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> study of ancient works in Chinese history.|$|R
40|$|We {{tabulate}} {{and measure}} the burden of disasters on the Pacific Island Countries (PICs) by aggregating and comparing the data found in the two global datasets on disaster impacts. We show that {{the most commonly used}} dataset greatly underestimates <b>the</b> burden of <b>disasters</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Pacific islands. Next, we describe a new index that aggregates disaster impacts, calculate this index <b>for</b> <b>the</b> PICs, and then compare <b>the</b> burden of <b>disasters</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> island countries of the Pacific with the island countries of the Caribbean. This comparison demonstrates quite clearly that the burden of disasters is significantly more acute in the Pacific. Lastly, we discuss the evidence regarding the future impact of climatic change in the Pacific on the region’s disaster burden. The Pacific is facing a very high degree of disaster risk, and that is only predicted to increase in the future. On the other hand, the region has a small population, and given the global resources available <b>for</b> <b>disaster</b> risk reduction, it can easily be seen as the frontier where attempts to create a more sustainable and resilient future can be put to their first tests. ...|$|R

5|$|At the {{strategic}} level the general uprising never eventuated, and in late February the communist offensive collapsed. Suffering more than 45,000 killed—against South Vietnamese and allied losses of only 6,000 men—it {{had been a}} tactical <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> communists. Regardless, the offensive {{was a turning point}} in the war. Prior to Tet American commanders and politicians had talked confidently about winning the war, arguing that Westmoreland's strategy of attrition had reached the point where the communists were losing soldiers and equipment faster than they could be replaced. Yet the scale of the fighting, and the surprise and violence with which the offensive was launched, had shocked the public, contradicting such predictions of imminent victory. Confidence in the military and political leadership collapsed, as did public support for the war in America. Ultimately, Tet was a publicity and media triumph for the communists, and Hanoi emerged with a significant political victory. In its wake President Lyndon Johnson announced that he would not seek a second term in office.|$|E
5|$|Despite Cimon's massive victory, {{something}} of a stalemate developed between Persia and the League. The Greeks {{do not appear to}} have pressed their advantage home in a meaningful way. If the later date of 466 BC for the Eurymedon campaign is accepted, this might be because the revolt in Thasos meant that resources were diverted away from Asia Minor to prevent the Thasians seceding from the League. Conversely, as Plutarch suggests, the Persians adopted a very defensive strategy in the Aegean for the next decade and a half. The Persian fleet was effectively absent from the Aegean until 451 BC, and Greek ships were able to ply the coasts of Asia Minor with impunity. The next major Delian League campaign against the Persian would only occur in 460 BC, when the Athenians decided to support a revolt in the Egyptian satrapy of the Persian empire. This campaign would last 6 years, before eventually ending in <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Greeks.|$|E
5|$|Duperré did {{not meet}} any British ships on his journey back to the French island, {{as most of the}} British {{blockade}} squadron were engaged {{in the aftermath of the}} Invasion of Île Bonaparte, conducted during July by Commodore Rowley. With the British distracted by this amphibious operation, it was simple for Duperré to reach Grand Port on the south east coast of Île de France in spite of the small blockade squadron under Captain Samuel Pym. This narrow and well-protected anchorage was considered to be the best place to refit the battered French squadron, but in August it came under attack by a British squadron in the Battle of Grand Port. This action was a <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> British as their ships became grounded in the unfamiliar shoals of the harbour and four frigates were lost under fire from shore batteries and Duperré's squadron.|$|E
50|$|The Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905 was a {{military}} <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> Russia. <b>The</b> 1905 Treaty of Portsmouth, concluded {{at the end of}} this war, gave the southern half of Sakhalin Island to Japan.|$|R
50|$|The {{confiscations}} of the 19th {{century were}} one of <b>the</b> biggest environmental <b>disasters</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Iberian Peninsula in centuries. The Confiscation of Madoz, in particular, resulted in the privatization of huge expanses of publicly owned forest. The oligarchs who bought <b>the</b> land paid, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> most part, with wood obtained from it. Much of the deforestation of the Iberian Peninsula occurred at that time, leading to the extinction of many {{plant and animal species}} in the region.|$|R

5|$|Four of {{the five}} French ships managed to break past the British blockade, taking shelter in the {{protected}} anchorage, which was only accessible {{through a series of}} complicated reefs and sandbanks that were impassable without an experienced harbour pilot. When Pym ordered his frigates to attack the anchored French on August 22 and 23, his ships became trapped in the narrow channels of the bay: two were irretrievably grounded; a third, outnumbered by the combined French squadron, was defeated; and a fourth was unable to close to within effective gun range. Although the French ships were also badly damaged, the battle was a <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> British: one ship was captured after suffering irreparable damage, the grounded ships were set on fire to prevent their capture by French boarding parties and the remaining vessel was seized as it left the harbour by the main French squadron from Port Napoleon under Commodore Jacques Hamelin.|$|E
5|$|The Hoops' defeat to Shelbourne in {{the first}} round of the FAI Cup in 1970, their first defeat in 32 Cup games over seven years, marked the start of the decline in the {{fortunes}} of the club. Despite only narrowly missing out on the League title in the 1970–71 season in controversial circumstances, the next twelve years proved to be a <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> club both on and off the field. On 25 April 1971, Rovers met Cork Hibs in Dalymount in a League play-off watched by 28,000 people. Their pre-match buildup was thrown into disarray when players and directors clashed over win bonuses. Hibs won the play-off 3–1. The next season, the Cunninghams, now under the control of sons Arthur and Des, sold the club to three brothers from Dublin; Paddy, Barton and Louis Kilcoyne. The Kilcoynes had witnessed decades of huge attendances at Irish football games and sought to take over the club primarily for business reasons. However, within the space of five years, the large crowds disappeared from Irish football stadia and combined with the demise of Drumcondra and Cork Hibs, the decline in fortunes of a number of top clubs and the lack of action by the FAI, the League of Ireland was plunged into a drastic decline.|$|E
