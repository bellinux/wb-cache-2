40|$|This {{dissertation}} samples three episodes from {{nineteenth century}} United States history that conveniently illustrate economic {{behavior in the}} arena of banking and finance. The first chapter considers improvements in cross-market arbitrage due to technological change. The completion of the undersea Atlantic telegraph cable in July 1866 more closely integrated securities markets on two continents. Chapter 1 conducts an event study on one security with a dual listing on the New York and London Stock Exchanges using daily data. The event study provides some evidence that the information lag between the two markets shortened from ten days to zero days. We can recover transatlantic steamship crossing times from securities prices. The second chapter investigates bank window dressing. Window dressing is a temporary change in portfolio designed to produce a more appealing report to regulators or to the public. Market observers accused national banks of window dressing after the Civil War. Chapter 2 attempts {{to determine whether or not}} postbellum Philadelphia banks window dressed their balance sheets. A test finds some evidence for window dressing. The third chapter conducts an econometric test of Diamond and Dybvig's (1983) theory of bank runs as interpreted by Calomiris and Gorton (1991). Diamond and Dybvig employ an exogenous liquidity shock to depositors in order to develop a theory of bank runs. Calomiris and Gorton interpret the exogenous liquidity shock as a seasonal withdrawal from the nation's agricultural interior. Chapter 3 reexamines the hypothesis that a seasonal interior reserve drain served as the exogenous liquidity shock before the bank panics of 1873 and 1893 in the United States. Using individual bank level data in New York, this paper tests whether the banks that held most of the deposits from the interior, the "interest-paying" banks, experience reserve drains just before the panic. The evidence reveals that a seasonal <b>interior</b> <b>drain</b> could have triggered the 1873 panic, but that Diamond and Dybvig's model cannot be applied to the bank panic of 1893 without a non-seasonal interpretation of the exogenous liquidity shock...|$|E
40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of suspended sediment and stream discharge, and their interrelationships, on intake rates in the Santa Cruz River. A lysimeter-flume, 100 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 5 feet deep, was constructed at the Field Laboratory. The interior boundaries of the unit were lined with butyl rubber to prevent leakage. A perforated pipe line was installed {{in the bottom of}} the lysimeter-flume to permit drainage of percolating water. The unit was filled with representative materials from the contiguous river bed. Cortrol sections were installed immediately before and after the flume to promote stabilization of flow conditions through the unit. A six-inch Parshall flume was located at the inlet of the upstream control section for measuring application rates during testing. A steel hopper, constructed and installed near the upstream control section, was used to store and meter sediment into the applied water in controlled amounts. The water supply for testing was obtained from the Field Laboratory. Three flow rates, 300 gpm, 450 gpm and 600 gpm, and three sediment concentrations, 10, 000 ppm, 20, 000 ppm, and 30, 000 ppm, were selected for experimentation. The nine possible treatment combinations from these application rates were replicated twice, so that a total of 18 trials {{were conducted}}, The combinations were tested in random order. During each trial, water and suspended sediment were metered onto the lysimeter-flume at the required rates. Infiltration rates were determined by measuring the discharge from the <b>interior</b> <b>drain</b> line. Recharge rates varied from 4. 2 feet/day to 5. 0 feet/day in the streambed model. In general, the effects of discharge and suspended sediment in Santa Cruz materials were similar to those reported for Rillito Creek materials. Increasing discharge rates appeared to increase infiltration rates indirectly through the effect of stream velocity on bed erosion and sedimentation. Increasing suspended sediment concentrations were found to be highly significant in reducing infiltration rates...|$|E

40|$|In {{the absence}} of {{significant}} body forces the passive manipulation of fluid interfacial flows is naturally achieved by control of the specific geometry and wetting properties of the system. Numerous 2 ̆ 7 microfluidic 2 ̆ 7 systems on Earth and 2 ̆ 7 macrofluidic 2 ̆ 7 systems aboard spacecraft routinely exploit such methods and the term ‘capillary fluidics’ is used to describe both length-scale limits. In this work a collection of analytic solutions is offered for passive and weakly forced flows where a bulk capillary liquid is slowly drained or supplied by a faster capillary flow along at least one interior edge of the container. The solutions are enabled by an assumed known pressure (or known height) dynamical boundary condition. Following a series of assumptions this boundary condition can be in part determined a priori from the container dimensions and further quantitative experimental evidence, but not proof, is provided in support of its expanded use herein. In general, a small parameter arises in the scaling of the problems permitting a decoupling of the edge flow from the global bulk meniscus flow. The quasi-steady asymptotic system of equations that results may then be easily solved in closed form for a useful variety of geometries including uniform and tapered sections possessing at least one critically wetted <b>interior</b> edge. <b>Draining,</b> filling, bubble displacement and other imbibing flows are studied. Cursory terrestrial and drop tower experiments agree well with the solutions. The solutions are valued for the facility they provide in computing designs for selected capillary fluidics problems by way of passive transport rates and meniscus displacement. Because geometric permutations of any given design are myriad, such analytic tools are capable of efficiently identifying and comparing critical design criteria (i. e. shape and size) {{and the impact of}} various wetting conditions resulting from the fluid properties and surface conditions.

40|$|Understanding the geomorphic {{setting of}} the Sigatoka dune field on the south coast of Viti Levu in Fiji is {{critical}} for interpreting the associated archaeological site, with culture levels dating back to 3000 years ago. The dune field lies along the seaward fringe of the Holocene delta of the Sigatoka River, which <b>drains</b> <b>interior</b> highlands astride {{the boundary between the}} wet windward and dry leeward climatic zones of Viti Levu. Sand brought down to the shoreline by the Sigatoka River is transported longshore westward by surf along the delta front and blown inland oblique to the shore by the prevailing trade winds. Three successive culture levels, dating to approximately 900 - 400 B. C., A. D. 100 - 400, and A. D. 1300 - 1500, respectively, occur in three discrete paleosol horizons that are buried near the present beach face under younger dune sand. Our geomorphic analysis of the Sigatoka delta plain arid its environs reveals a complex Holocene history of progradation and aggradation, shifting distributaries, sea-level change, subsidence owing to sediment compaction, and enhancement of dune development through time. The oldest two of the three paleosols that have yielded artifacts evidently formed on a low-lying backbeach coastal flat, located behind a beach-dune berm-crest ridge of low relief, with only the youngest of the three paleosols representing a temporarily stabilized surface within a growing dune field. Enhanced dune growth may have been fostered by augmented sediment delivery to the coast as a result of wholesale inland deforestation associated with population movement into the interior highlands of the Sigatoka drainage basin.

40|$|High-resolution swath {{bathymetry}} and TOPAS sub-bottom profiler acoustic {{data from}} the inner and middle continental shelf of north-east Greenland record the presence of streamlined mega-scale glacial lineations and other subglacial landforms that are formed in {{the surface of a}} continuous soft sediment layer. The best-developed lineations are found in Westwind Trough, a bathymetric trough connecting Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden Gletscher and Zachariae Isstrøm to the continental shelf edge. The geomorphological and stratigraphical data indicate that the Greenland Ice Sheet covered the inner-middle shelf in north-east Greenland during the most recent ice advance of the Late Weichselian glaciation. Earlier sedimentological and chronological studies indicated that the last major delivery of glacigenic sediment to the shelf and Fram Strait was prior to the Holocene during Marine Isotope Stage 2, supporting our assertion that the subglacial landforms and ice sheet expansion in north-east Greenland occurred during the Late Weichselian. Glacimarine sediment gravity flow deposits found on the north-east Greenland continental slope imply that the ice sheet extended beyond the middle continental shelf, and supplied subglacial sediment direct to the shelf edge with subsequent remobilisation downslope. These marine geophysical data indicate that the flow of the Late Weichselian Greenland Ice Sheet through Westwind Trough was {{in the form of a}} fast-flowing palaeo-ice stream, and that it provides the first direct geomorphological evidence for the former presence of ice streams on the Greenland continental shelf. The presence of streamlined subglacially derived landforms and till layers on the shallow AWI Bank and Northwind Shoal indicates that ice sheet flow was not only channelled through the cross-shelf bathymetric troughs but also occurred across the shallow intra-trough regions of north-east Greenland. Collectively these data record for the first time that ice streams were an important glacio-dynamic feature that <b>drained</b> <b>interior</b> basins of the Late Weichselian Greenland Ice Sheet across the adjacent continental margin, and that the ice sheet was far more extensive in north-east Greenland during the Last Glacial Maximum than the previous terrestrial-glacial reconstructions showed...|$|R
40|$|The bicycle {{invented in}} Europe at the {{beginning}} of 19 th century was a vehicle which was used by elites at first, then it wasused for sporting purposes. After the bicycle started to become widespread, it was brought to Ottoman Empire by Levantines andat first it was used postal service, police organization and army. The news about the bicycle was firstly announced by Tarik Newsin Ottoman Empire in 1885. An American called Mösyö Tomas İstefanis came to İstanbul by his bicycle, then reached Ankara viaİzmit in 5 days, and from there he reached to Sivas via Yozgat. A text about using bicycle in army in a Europe newspaper was presented to sultan in 1894. As time went by, bicyclesincreased in number in İstanbul. While one of the bicycles was offered to palace, municipality of İstanbul took precautions forregulation of using bicycle. The number of people who wandered by a bicycle at Beyoğlu in İstanbul increased, so the municipalityinvoked Ministry of the Interior to be banned the wanderings at Beyoğlu, except Taksim-Şişli Road. A bicycle contest fromVienna to İstanbul was planned to be done by an attempt of bicycle associations in Vienna but this contest couldn’t beimplemented. At the end of 19 th century, on Ottoman lands except capital İstanbul the cities where bicycles were commonly used wereİzmir and Selanik. In the Ottoman period, the first bicycle contests were arranged at a wooden grandstand velodrome in Selanikin 1897. Levantine families in İzmir were initiators of bringing cycling to the city. They were also the initiators of bringing otherchanges in Western to the country. The first bicycle contest was done in İzmir on May 15 th, 1895. Bicycle contests took place, tooat games arranged by Rum (greek who hold Turkish citizenship) clubs in İzmir since 1900. It is seen that bicycle and athleticismcompetitions were arranged regularly by clubs established by Levantines. The first bicycle competition in İstanbul was arranged on August 18 th, 1895. This competition in Tarabya was arranged in 5 different tracks but any Turks didn’t join the competition. Sellers who imported bicycles to the country started to introduce thebicycles by building velodromes. Some promoters arranged bicycle competitions at concrete tracks made by them in Tepebaşı inİstanbul. When these competitions turned into betting games, they were banned. Bicycle competitions in İstanbul started to bedone again after the declaration of Second Constitutional Monarchy. Fenerbahçe was the first club giving importance to bicyclesport during its activities. Cyclists playing for Fenerbahçe shared championship at first bicycle competitions arranged in Turkey in 1912. After Second Constitutional Monarchy there were attempts to be bought bicycles to police station at many provinces. Therewere formal requests such as buying bicycles and teaching staff how to cycle from revenue office. The reason of these financialrequests was to speed up policemen’s work. It is extracted that Abdülhamit ordered a research to be done into bicycles used in American army in 1894. A documentincluding using bicycle at armies was presented to Second Abdülhamit by İstanbul embassy of U. S. A on October 21 st, 1894. Atranslation of a newspaper cutting including technical knowledge about bicycle was added to the document, too. It is seen that except army at some departments bicycles were used for clerks to provide them to move quickly. It is written atone of the correspondence made for buying bicycles that state contributions for necessary bicycles which would be used by clerksof ministry of the <b>interior</b> <b>drained</b> away in 1915, so some bicycles were received, provided that the expenses would be paid fromsubsidy of next year. A bicycle federation was formed in 1923 after forming of “Türkiye İdman Cemiyetleri İttifakı”. The first president of thefederation was Muvaffak (Menemencioğlu) Bey one of the promoters of bicycle sport. The first major road competition in Turkey was arranged in Fethiye-Antalya by Ege Gençlerbirliği Club in 1924. The firstTurkey Bicycle Competition was arranged in İstanbul in 1926. In bicycle sport the first national game was played against Bulgariaat Taksim stadium track in 1927. In this competition Bulgarian and Turkish cyclists shared championship. There was a halt inbicycle sport with the removal of bicycle federation in 1929. The bicycle federation was formed again with the decision of generalcongress of Türkiye İdman Cemiyetleri İttifakı in 1933. Turkish National Bicycle Team couldn’t take any rank in Olympic games in Berlin in 1936. Talat Tunçalp took part in a 100 -kilometer road race that 30 riders participated. He entered in front row to the last meters, but a series of mishap led him to be last. Cycling in the Second World War years with a shortage of spare parts and tires had a period of stagnation. Four Turkishcyclists participating in London Olympics couldn’t complete the 195 -kilometer endurance road race due to puncture andmechanical malfunction in 1948. Cavit Cav, making much effort to develop the sport of cycling, attempted to construct a factory producing bicycles in 1961,but he failed in his attempt. Bisan joint-stock company established in İzmir in 1963 started to produce Turkey's first domesticbicycles. The International Marmara Race started by attempts of Talat Tunçalp in 1963 was converted to the Presidential Tour ofTurkey in 1964. This was done by extending racetrack and increasing the number of laps. The tour which is the most importantbicycle competition of Turkey has been going on since that day. 46 th Presidential Tour of Turkey ascended to the 2. 0 level ininternational category and was broadcasted by TRT, in this way reached a large number of spectators in 2010. Konya which had plain lands was famous for a bicycle city in the years of 1950 s. In those years there were 6000 bicycles inKonya-city center. The bicycle sport developed in Konya through velodrome which was built in 1952. Konya Mevlana Tour wasstarted to be arranged in 1990 and it was an international tour in 1922. Work is continuing on the development of cycling in Turkey. Turkish Basketball Federation adds new work to the existingcompetitions. In the intervening 120 years, from 1890 s to today, the use of bicycle in everyday life has increased and gained mobility insporting terms. However, it is difficult to say that bicycles are commonly used as a healthy means of transport in Turkey likedeveloped countries. It is a necessity of civilization that the use of bicycles is encouraged for reasons such as physical health,energy conservation, environmental awareness and city roads are built according to bicycle...|$|R

This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Journal of Quaternary Science [© John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] swath bathymetry and TOPAS sub-bottom profiler acoustic data from the inner and middle continental shelf of north-east Greenland record the presence of streamlined mega-scale glacial lineations and other subglacial landforms that are formed in the surface of a continuous soft sediment layer. The best-developed lineations are found in Westwind Trough, a bathymetric trough connecting Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden Gletscher and Zachariae Isstrøm to the continental shelf edge. The geomorphological and stratigraphical data indicate that the Greenland Ice Sheet covered the inner-middle shelf in north-east Greenland during the most recent ice advance of the Late Weichselian glaciation. Earlier sedimentological and chronological studies indicated that the last major delivery of glacigenic sediment to the shelf and Fram Strait was prior to the Holocene during Marine Isotope Stage 2, supporting our assertion that the subglacial landforms and ice sheet expansion in north-east Greenland occurred during the Late Weichselian. Glacimarine sediment gravity flow deposits found on the north-east Greenland continental slope imply that the ice sheet extended beyond the middle continental shelf, and supplied subglacial sediment direct to the shelf edge with subsequent remobilisation downslope. These marine geophysical data indicate that the flow of the Late Weichselian Greenland Ice Sheet through Westwind Trough was {{in the form of a}} fast-flowing palaeo-ice stream, and that it provides the first direct geomorphological evidence for the former presence of ice streams on the Greenland continental shelf. The presence of streamlined subglacially derived landforms and till layers on the shallow AWI Bank and Northwind Shoal indicates that ice sheet flow was not only channelled through the cross-shelf bathymetric troughs but also occurred across the shallow intra-trough regions of north-east Greenland. Collectively these data record for the first time that ice streams were an important glacio-dynamic feature that <b>drained</b> <b>interior</b> basins of the Late Weichselian Greenland Ice Sheet across the adjacent continental margin, and that the ice sheet was far more extensive in north-east Greenland during the Last Glacial Maximum than the previous terrestrial–glacial reconstructions showed...|$|R
