50|$|Double skin (USA: double wall): The outer tent is a {{waterproof}} layer which extends {{down to the}} ground all round. One or more 'inner tents' provide sleeping areas. The outer tent may be just a little larger than the <b>inner</b> <b>tent,</b> or it may be a lot larger and provide a covered living area separate from the sleeping area(s). An <b>inner</b> <b>tent</b> is not waterproof, but allows water vapour to pass through so that condensation occurs only on the exterior side. The double layer may also provide some thermal insulation. Either the outer skin or the inner skin may be the structural component, carrying the poles; the structural skin is always pitched first, though some tents are built with the outer and inner linked so that they are both pitched at the same time.|$|R

5000|$|A {{flysheet}} or rain fly (found only {{in double}} skin tents) {{is used to}} protect the actual tent from water. A flysheet is waterproof {{on the outside and}} also provides a surface to collect condensation on the inside, which then runs down to the ground. When a flysheet is used, it is important that there be no contact with the <b>inner</b> <b>tent</b> it is protecting; this keeps the <b>inner</b> dry. 'Expedition' <b>tents</b> often have extra poles to help ensure that wind does not blow the two layers into contact.|$|R

5000|$|Dome tents have a {{very simple}} {{structure}} and are available {{in a wide variety}} of sizes ranging from lightweight 2-person tents with limited headroom up to 6 or 9-person tents with headroom exceeding 180 cm. These may be single wall, or single-wall with partial flysheet, or double wall. Depending on the pole arrangement, some models pitch outer-tent first, while others pitch inner-tent first. The former helps keep the <b>inner</b> <b>tent</b> dry, but the latter is easier to pitch.|$|R

5000|$|The {{vestibule}} (they can be plural) is a floorless covered section located {{outside a}} tent entrance that is typically {{used for the}} storage of boots, packs, and other small equipment. Vestibules are often used for activities that are preferably not performed within the tent itself, such as cooking or equipment cleaning. Vestibules may be included as a removable attachment or integrated into the tent itself. Vestibule size varies considerably, ranging from extended areas with more surface than the <b>inner</b> <b>tent</b> down to practically nothing.|$|R

40|$|There is {{a gap in}} today’s {{market in}} the Rigid Inflatable Boat {{industry}} for an add-on sleeping accommodation {{to bridge the gap}} between Open Rigid Inflatable Boats (RIBs) and Cabin RIBs. As the leisure market in the RIB industry is expanding continuously people want to take their boats further a field, but can not afford the price increase to a Cabin RIB therefore an interim method is required. Research data for popular sized RIBs, anthropometrics and ergonomics was collected and analysed to determine an ideal boat to base the accommodation on which fulfilled the design brief. Add-on accommodation was designed to fit a Gemini Waverider 730. The accommodation consists of a semi permanent fibreglass, 3 -section structure, a fold down canvass shelter and an <b>inner</b> <b>tent</b> with built in groundsheet to sleep in. The canvass folds down from the roof section on the structure when stationary and the <b>inner</b> <b>tent</b> is then clipped in place. The design had to conform to towing regulations and the Recreational Craft Directives (RCD). The effect the accommodation has on the RIB was evaluated. As the accommodation was estimated to weigh 80 kg, the trim and performance of the RIB would not be affected. The maximum stress on the structure was calculated to be 2. 43 MPa and the lifting force 1236 N...|$|R

These six spaces not taking up the whole circumference, what other apartments the outer circle had, were thus ordered: as soon as you were in {{at the door of the}} outer circle, you had a short passage straight before you to the door of the inner house; but on either side was a wicker partition, and a door in it, by which you went first into a large room or storehouse, twenty feet wide, and about thirty feet long, and through that into another not quite so long: so that in the outer circle were ten handsome rooms, six of which were only to be come at through the apartments of the <b>inner</b> <b>tent,</b> and served as closets or retired rooms to the respective chambers of the inner circle; and four large warehouses or barns, or what you please to call them, which went in through one another, two on either hand of the passage that led through the outer door to the <b>inner</b> <b>tent.</b>|$|R

5000|$|A {{groundsheet}} is used {{to provide}} a waterproof barrier between the ground and a sleeping bag. With double skin <b>tents,</b> the <b>inner</b> <b>tents</b> normally have a sewn-in groundsheet, but a separate flat groundsheet may be provided for any living area. With single skin tents, the groundsheet may be sewn in or separate. Normal practice with sewn-in groundsheets is for the groundsheet to extend some 15 cm up {{the lower part of}} the walls (sometimes called a 'bathtub' arrangement); this copes with a situation where water seeps under the side walls of the tent. Separate groundsheets allow load-sharing when backpacking, and may make it easier to pitch and strike a tent, but they provide less protection against insects etc. getting into the sleeping area; also, if any part of a separate groundsheet protrudes from under the side walls, then it provides a ready path for moisture to flow into the tent.|$|R
5000|$|Frame tents are double-skin tents. They have {{a living}} area {{and one or}} more cotton/nylon/polyester <b>inner</b> <b>tents.</b> The outer tent is draped over a {{free-standing}} steel frame, and may be made of canvas or polyester (the latter often has a hydrostatic head of 3000 mm, i.e. three season camping). The living area is generally at least {{as large as the}} sleeping area, and there may be a specific section with window and extra air vents for use as a kitchen. The walls are nearly vertical and are typically about 150 to 180 cm high. The center of the gently sloping roof is often 210 cm high or more and provides reasonable headroom throughout. The smaller 2-person models were less than 3 metres square (10 ft), but these have largely been replaced by dome or tunnel tents. The larger 8-person models may exceed 5 m in length and/or width.|$|R

They were strange-looking creatures, short of form and round of face, with straight black hair and mouths unusually large.

60|$|So {{much had}} they {{addicted}} themselves to wicker-work, {{prompted by the}} ingenuity of the Indians, who assisted them, that when I viewed the Englishmen's colonies, they seemed at a distance {{as though they had}} lived like bees in a hive: for Will Atkins, who was now become a very industrious and sober man, had made himself a tent of basket-work round the outside; the walls were worked in as a basket, in pannels or strong squares of thirty-two in number, standing about seven feet high: in the middle was another, not above twenty-two paces round, but much stronger built, being of an octagonal form, and in the eight corners stood eight strong poles, round the top of which he raised a pyramid for the roof, mighty pretty, I assure you, and joined very well together, with iron spikes, which he made himself; for he had made him a forge, with a pair of wooden bellows and charcoal for his work, forming an anvil cut of one of the iron crows, to work upon, and in the manner would he make himself hooks, staples, spikes, bolts, and hinges. After he had pitched the roof of his innermost tent, he made it so firm between the rafters with basket-work, thatching that over again with rice-straw, and over that a large leaf of a tree, that his house was as dry {{as if it had been}} tiled or slated. The outer circuit was covered as a lean-to, quite round this inner appartment, laying long rafters from the thirty-two angles to the top posts of the inner house, about twenty-feet distant, so that there was a space like a wall between the outer and inner wall, near twenty feet in breadth. The inner place he partitioned off with the same wicker-work, dividing it into six neat apartments every one of which had a door, first into the entry of the main tent, and another into the space and walk that was round it, not only convenient for retreat, but for family necessaries. Within the door of the outer circle, there was a passage directly to the door of the inner house; on either side was a wicker partition, and a door, by which you go into a room twenty-two feet wide, and about thirty long, and through that into another of a smaller length; so that in the outer circle were ten handsome rooms, six of which were only to be come at through the apartments of the <b>inner</b> <b>tent,</b> serving as retiring rooms to the respective chambers of the inner circle, and four large warehouses, which went in through one another, two on either hand of the passage that led through the outer door to the <b>inner</b> <b>tent.</b> In short, nothing could be built more ingeniously, kept more neat, or have better conveniences; and here lived the three families, Will Atkins, his companion, their wives and children, and the widow of the deceased. As to religion, the men seldom taught their wives the knowledge of God, any more than the sailors' custom of swearing by his name. The greatest improvement their wives had, was, they taught them to speak English, so as to be understood.|$|R
