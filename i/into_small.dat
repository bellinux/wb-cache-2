5|$|Biological {{structures}} or sequences {{in different}} taxa are homologous {{if they are}} derived from a common ancestor. Homology thus implies divergent evolution. For example, many insects (such as dragonflies) possess two pairs of flying wings. In beetles, the first pair of wings {{has evolved into a}} pair of hard wing covers, while in Dipteran flies the second pair of wings has evolved <b>into</b> <b>small</b> halteres used for balance.|$|E
5|$|Deprived of {{his left}} wing (still {{in pursuit of the}} Norman right), Alexios was exposed in the centre. Guiscard sent his heavy cavalry against the Byzantine centre. They first routed the Byzantine skirmishers before {{breaking}} <b>into</b> <b>small</b> detachments and smashing into various points of the Byzantine line. This charge broke the Byzantine lines and caused them to rout. The imperial camp, which had been left unguarded, fell to the Normans.|$|E
5000|$|Separable {{permutations}} {{may also}} be used to describe hierarchical partitions of rectangles <b>into</b> <b>smaller</b> rectangles (so-called [...] "slicing floorplans", used for instance in the design of integrated circuits) by using the positive and negative signs of the separating tree to describe horizontal and vertical slices of a rectangle <b>into</b> <b>smaller</b> rectangles.|$|R

5|$|In {{computer}} vision, {{digital images}} are partitioned <b>into</b> <b>small</b> square pixels, {{each of which}} has its own color. The dual graph of this subdivision into squares has a vertex per pixel and an edge between pairs of pixels that share an edge; it is useful for applications including clustering of pixels into connected regions of similar colors.|$|E
5|$|Many rove beetles {{have greatly}} reduced elytra, {{and while they}} are capable of flight, they most often move on the ground: their soft bodies and strong {{abdominal}} muscles make them flexible, easily able to wriggle <b>into</b> <b>small</b> cracks.|$|E
5|$|Sandwiches usually using markook or khubz, such as Shawarma and Falafel {{are also}} common bread meals. Shawarma {{can be served}} as a {{sandwich}} or meal with shaved meat and bread. Shawarma can be chicken or beef, and is adorned {{with a variety of}} garnishes. These can include pickles, hummus, or a garlic yogurt mix. Falafel, fried chickpeas, parsley and onion are fried <b>into</b> <b>small</b> patties and are adorned with similar toppings as shawarma.|$|E

5|$|The koala {{has several}} adaptations for its {{eucalypt}} diet, {{which is of}} low nutritive value, of high toxicity, and high in dietary fibre. The animal's dentition consists of the incisors and cheek teeth (a single premolar and four molars on each jaw), which are separated by a large gap (a characteristic feature of herbivorous mammals). The incisors are used for grasping leaves, which are then passed to the premolars to be snipped at the petiole before being passed to the highly cusped molars, where they are shredded <b>into</b> <b>small</b> pieces. Koalas may also store food in their cheek pouches before it {{is ready to be}} chewed. The partially worn molars of middle-aged koalas are optimal for breaking the leaves <b>into</b> <b>small</b> particles, resulting in more efficient stomach digestion and nutrient absorption in the small intestine, which digests the eucalyptus leaves to provide most of the animal's energy. A koala sometimes regurgitates the food into the mouth to be chewed a second time.|$|E

At times the river has been closed to traffic to aid the demolition. The job is dangerous and two workers have died.|$|E

5|$|Variety frustosus is morphologically {{similar to}} the main type, but its cap becomes areolate (marked out <b>into</b> <b>small</b> areas by cracks and crevices) in maturity. Its spores are {{slightly}} smaller too, measuring 11–15 by 4–5.5µm. In the European form ereticulatus, the reticulations on the upper stipe are replaced with fine reddish granules, while the variety ruforubraporus has pinkish-red pores.|$|E
5|$|After Watson's death, {{the hotel}} lost its {{popularity}} to the rival Taj Hotel. In the 1960s {{the hotel was}} closed. Sometime after this, it was subdivided and partitioned <b>into</b> <b>small</b> cubicles with independent access and let out on rent. Over the years, apathy toward the building by the residents has resulted the building decaying, {{and it is now}} in a dilapidated state. The atrium was subsequently used as a dumping ground and has several illegal constructions. , building had 53 families and 97 commercial establishments. Most of the commercial establishments are chambers of lawyers attached to the adjacent Bombay Civil & Session Courts and the nearby Bombay High Court.|$|E
5|$|An {{immediate}} concern of environmentalists was the potential {{use of chemical}} dispersants. To keep big slicks from washing ashore, dispersants {{can be used to}} break the oil <b>into</b> <b>small</b> droplets that disperse throughout the water column. There are significant concerns about the health effects of the dispersants and the effects on aquatic life. Coast Guard officials overseeing the cleanup indicated that no chemical dispersants were being used but did not immediately rule the use of them out.|$|E

5|$|Archaeologists have {{attributed}} these circles to the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, {{and have}} noted that they are comparable to the stone circles found further south, in Dartmoor. However, {{in contrast to the}} two known Exmoor circles, over seventy such monuments have been identified on Dartmoor. This may be because Exmoor, unlike Dartmoor, has no natural granite. Instead it has Devonian slates and Hangman Grits, both of which easily break up <b>into</b> <b>small</b> slabs, resulting in a general shortage of big stones on Exmoor.|$|E
5|$|Ba Cụt was {{publicly}} guillotined on 13 July 1956, in Cần Thơ. His {{body was}} later diced <b>into</b> <b>small</b> pieces, {{which were then}} buried separately. Some followers, led by a deputy named Bảy Đớm, retreated to a small area beside the Cambodian border, where they vowed not to rest until Ba Cụt was avenged. Many of his followers later joined the Việt Cộng—the movement that succeeded the Việt Minh their leader had fought—and took up arms against Diệm.|$|E
5|$|Bardou-Jacquet {{wanted to}} compose the {{advertisement}} {{with as little}} computer-generated imagery as possible, believing that the final product would be that much more appealing to its audience. To this end, he set two months aside {{for the creation of}} hundreds of conceptual drawings detailing various possible interactions between the parts, and a further four months for practical testing and development. For the testing phase, the script was broken <b>into</b> <b>small</b> segments, each comprising only one or two interactions. Ideas deemed unworkable by the testing crew, such as airbag explosions and collisions between front and rear sections of the car, were abandoned, and the remaining segments were slowly brought together until the full and final sequence was developed.|$|E
