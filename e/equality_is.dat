5|$|The Right to <b>Equality</b> <b>is</b> one of {{the chief}} {{guarantees}} of the Constitution. It is embodied in Articles 14–16, which collectively encompass the general principles of equality before law and non-discrimination, and Articles 17–18 which collectively encompass further the philosophy of social equality. Article 14 guarantees equality before law as well as equal protection of the law to all persons within the territory of India. This includes the equal subjection of all persons to the authority of law, as well as equal treatment of persons in similar circumstances. The latter permits the State to classify persons for legitimate purposes, provided there is a reasonable basis for the same, meaning that the classification is required to be non-arbitrary, based on a method of intelligible differentiation among those sought to be classified, as well as have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the classification.|$|E

25|$|<b>Equality</b> <b>is</b> both an {{equivalence}} relation and a partial order. <b>Equality</b> <b>is</b> {{also the only}} relation on a set that is reflexive, symmetric and antisymmetric. In algebraic expressions, equal variables may be substituted for one another, a facility that is not available for equivalence related variables. The equivalence classes of an {{equivalence relation}} can substitute for one another, but not individuals within a class.|$|E

During the governmental reforms effected January 6, 2001, the Gender <b>Equality</b> Bureau <b>was</b> established under the newly formulated Cabinet Office. Coupled with the Gender Equality Council, the Bureau is tasked with devising and coordinating plans regarding issues of gender equality in addition to executing plans that fall outside of the jurisdiction of any other ministry.

25|$|One {{advantage}} of this alternative realization is that <b>equality</b> <b>is</b> identity, not an inductively defined relation.

Comparing 20% to 20%, perfect <b>equality</b> <b>is</b> expressed as 1; 20% to 40% changes this value to 0.5.|$|E

25|$|In {{the context}} of {{category}} theory, objects are usually at most isomorphic—indeed, a motivation {{for the development of}} category theory was showing that different constructions in homology theory yielded equivalent (isomorphic) groups.

As such, during the past decades the position of women in Spanish society has greatly improved.|$|E
