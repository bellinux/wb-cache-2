The <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transferase</b> (GGT) enzyme was previously thought to be helpful in confirming a hepatic source of ALP; however, GGT elevations lack the necessary specificity to be a useful confirmatory test for ALP. Normally GGT and ALP are anchored to membranes of hepatocytes and are released in small amounts in hepatocellular damage. In cholestasis, synthesis of these enzymes is induced and they are made soluble. GGT is elevated because it leaks out from the bile duct cells due to pressure from inside bile ducts.|$|E
50|$|Metadoxine is an ion pair salt of {{pyridoxine}} and pyrrolidon carboxilate (PCA). Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) is {{a precursor}} of coenzymes including pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP), which accelerates the metabolic degradation of ethanol and prevents adenosine triphosphate (ATP) inactivation by acetaldehyde. Pyridoxal phosphate dependent enzymes {{also play a}} role in the biosynthesis of four important neurotransmitters: serotonin (5-HT), epinephrine, norepinephrine and GABA: see vitamin B6 functions. L-PGA is present in the diet and is produced endogenously by enzymatic conversion of gamma-glutamyl amino acids to L-PGA and free amino acids. In the central nervous system (CNS), L-PGA was found to have a role in composition of neuro-active molecules. Its production has been linked to hepatic <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transferase</b> activity and levels of reduced glutathione (GSH).

Waist circumference, subscapular skinfold and body mass index all had similar positive associations with total cholesterol, triglycerides and diastolic blood pressure. <b>Gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transferase</b> levels were associated with indicators of fatness and fat distribution (waist circumference, waist/hip ratio, body mass index, and subscapular skinfold) and serum lipids (total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides). <b>Gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transferase</b> and body mass index both made independent contributions to the explanation of the waist/hip ratio. In multiple regression analysis, <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transferase</b> levels were (after adjustment for waist/hip ratio and body mass index) associated with serum lipids (total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides), but not with HDL-cholesterol and blood pressure.

40|$|ABSTRACT CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: The {{location}} of embolism {{is associated with}} clinical findings and disease severity in cases of acute pulmonary embolism. The level of <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transferase</b> increases under oxidative stress-related conditions. In this study, we investigated whether <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transferase</b> levels could predict the {{location of}} pulmonary embolism. DESIGN AND SETTING: Hospital-based cross-sectional study at Cumhuriyet University, Sivas, Turkey. METHODS : 120 patients who were diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism through computed tomography-assisted pulmonary angiography were evaluated. They {{were divided into two}} main groups (proximally and distally located), and subsequently into subgroups according to thrombus localization as follows: first group (thrombus in main pulmonary artery; n = 9); second group (thrombus in main pulmonary artery branches; n = 71); third group (thrombus in pulmonary artery segmental branches; n = 34); and fourth group (thrombus in pulmonary artery subsegmental branches; n = 8). RESULTS : <b>Gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transferase</b> levels on admission, heart rate, oxygen saturation, right ventricular dilatation/hypokinesia, pulmonary artery systolic pressure and cardiopulmonary resuscitation requirement showed prognostic significance in univariate analysis. The multivariate logistic regression model showed that <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transferase</b> level on admission (odds ratio, OR = 1. 044; 95 % confidence interval, CI: 1. 011 - 1. 079; P = 0. 009) and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (OR = 1. 063; 95 % CI: 1. 005 - 1. 124; P = 0. 033) remained independently associated with proximally localized thrombus in pulmonary artery.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to analyze the serum levels of aspartate and alanine aminotransferases, <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transferase,</b> and the hematocrit in patients with chronic kidney disease who were undergoing peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients on peritoneal dialysis and 40 on hemodialysis were assessed, and the patients were matched according to the length of time that they had been on dialysis. Blood samples were collected (both before and after the session for those on hemodialysis) to measure the enzymes and the hematocrit. RESULTS: In the samples from the patients who were undergoing peritoneal dialysis, the aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels were slightly higher compared with the samples collected from the patients before the hemodialysis session and slightly lower compared with the samples collected after the hemodialysis session. The levels of <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transferase</b> in the hemodialysis patients were slightly higher than the levels in the patients who were undergoing peritoneal dialysis. In addition, the levels of aminotransferases and <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transferase</b> that were collected before the hemodialysis session were significantly lower than the values collected after the session. The hematocrit levels were significantly lower in the patients who were on peritoneal dialysis compared with the patients on hemodialysis (both before and after the hemodialysis session), and the levels were also significantly lower before hemodialysis compared with after hemodialysis. CONCLUSION: The aminotransferase levels in the patients who were undergoing peritoneal dialysis were slightly higher compared with the samples collected before the hemodialysis session, whereas the aminotransferase levels were slightly lower compared with the samples collected after the session. The hematocrits and the aminotransferase and <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transferase</b> levels of the samples collected after the hemodialysis session were significantly higher than the samples collected before the session. Taken together, the present data suggest that hemodilution could alter the serum levels of liver enzymes...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} the baseline status of patients with hepatitis B virus-associated acute-on-chronic liver failure on short-term outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted that included a total of 138 patients with hepatitis B virus-associated acute-on-chronic liver failure admitted to the Department of Infectious Diseases, Taihe Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine, from November 2013 to October 2016. The patients were divided into a poor prognosis group (74 patients) and a good prognosis group (64 patients) based on the disease outcome. General information, clinical indicators and prognostic scores of the patients’ baseline status were analyzed, and a prediction model was established accordingly. RESULTS: Elder age, treatment with artificial liver support systems and the frequency of such treatments, high levels of white blood cells, neutrophils, neutrophil count/lymphocyte count ratio, alanine aminotransferase, <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transferase,</b> total bilirubin, urea, and prognostic scores as well as low levels of albumin and sodium were all significantly associated with the short-term outcomes of hepatitis B virus-associated acute-on-chronic liver failure. The predictive model showed that logit (p) = 3. 068 + 1. 003 × neutrophil count/lymphocyte count ratio - 0. 892 × <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transferase</b> - 1. 138 × albumin - 1. 364 × sodium + 1. 651 × artificial liver support therapy. CONCLUSION: The neutrophil count/lymphocyte count ratio and serum levels of <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transferase,</b> albumin and sodium were independent risk factors predicting short-term outcomes of hepatitis B virus-associated acute-on-chronic liver failure, and the administration of multiple treatments with artificial liver support therapy during the early stage is conducive to improved short-term outcomes...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{define a}} {{possible}} metabolic and/or signaling role for Cys-Gly in glutathione homeostasis in bovine eye lenses. METHODS: Bovine lenses were cultured up to 24 h {{in a medium}} containing 0. 5 mM reduced glutathione (GSH) under different conditions. The intracellular and the extracellular contents of thiol compounds were evaluated using a free zone capillary electrophoresis method. RESULTS: Culture of lenses {{in the presence of}} GSH and the <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transferase</b> inhibitor serine-borate demonstrated a 1. 5 fold increase in the level of extra-lenticular glutathione with respect to the initial value. Cys-Gly exogenously added impaired the extra-lenticular accumulation of glutathione. Both cysteine and gamma-Glu-Cys were ineffective in reducing extra-lenticular glutathione accumulation. In all conditions no differences in reduced and total intra-lenticular glutathione levels were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The impairment of Cys-Gly generation correlated with inhibition of <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transferase</b> by serine/borate, resulting in high extra-lenticular concentration of glutathione effluxed from the bovine lens. The possibility that Cys-Gly may intervene either in the replenishment processes for cysteine in the GSH biosynthetic step or in the function of the efflux GSH-transporters is considered...|$|E

Adhering to {{the hypothesis that}} the exposure of hepatocytes to free fatty acids, resulting in increased ROS production and mitochondrial damage, is balanced by the presence of antioxidant substances, circulating levels of <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transferase,</b> cytochrome c, triglycerides and unconjugated bilirubin were explored in patients suffering from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with different severity. One hundred and eighty-six consecutive patients who presented recent ultrasound feature of bright liver without any liver disease of known origin were enrolled, eighty-nine of whom underwent liver biopsy. Forty-five subjects were allocated on the basis of histology in fatty liver group while 44 patients formed the group with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. A cohort of 27 young, lean, apparently healthy individuals was selected as control group. The levels of <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transferase</b> were normal or slightly increased, while unconjugated bilirubin concentrations were elevated in all the spectra of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Comparing the present results with relevant findings from other studies dealing with diseases characterized by apoptosis, we did not find high circulating levels of cytochrome c in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

40|$|BACKGROUND Stroke {{is one of}} {{the major}} health {{problems}} in many countries. There is supporting evidence suggesting that <b>Gamma-Glutamyl</b> <b>Transferase</b> (GGT) enzyme has an active involvement in atherosclerosis through its oxidative and inflammatory mechanisms. With this background, we conducted a study among acute stroke patients with an aim and objective to evaluate the relationship between stroke and serum GGT levels and to assess the severity of various types of stroke in relation to the levels of serum GGT enzyme. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 50 acute stroke patients and 50 normal individuals as controls participated in the study. Stroke patients were advised for routine haematological investigations, serum GGT estimation and plain CT of brain. RESULTS Out of the 50 acute stroke patients who participated in our study, 32 patients had elevated levels of serum GGT and 3 patients had drastically elevated levels of GGT (> 100 IU/L). A statistically significant relationship was found between ischaemic stroke and GGT with a p-value of 0. 0418.

40|$|Liver {{ischemia}} is {{of clinical}} interest {{because of its}} role in liver failure and also hepatic graft rejection. The generation of reactive oxygen species contributes to the injury that follows ischemia-reperfusion. One therapy utilizes the administration of antioxidants; however, only limited experience suggests a potential benefit of systemic administration of these compounds. To overcome the limitations of these compounds, small molecules with improved cell membrane permeability characteristics and higher potency, such as tempol, are being tested in vivo. Tempol, a membrane-permeable radical scavenger, interferes with the formation or the effects of many radicals, including superoxide anions, hydroxyl radicals, and peroxynitrite. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effects of tempol in an in vivo rat model of liver ischemia-reperfusion injury. Male Wistar rats were pretreated with tempol (30 mg/kg, IV) 5 minutes prior to liver ischemia (for 30 minutes) and reperfusion (for 2 hours). The liver injury was assessed by measuring serum levels of transaminases, lactate dehydrogenase, and <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transferase.</b> Tempol significantly mitigated the increase in transaminases, lactate dehydrogenase, and <b>gamma-glutamyl</b> <b>transferase</b> following liver ischemia-reperfusion, suggesting an improvement in liver function and resistance to injury...|$|E
