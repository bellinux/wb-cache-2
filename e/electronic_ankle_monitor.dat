50|$|In 2015, eight {{organizations}} including John E. Reid & Associates {{settled with}} Juan Rivera, who was wrongfully {{convicted of the}} 1992 {{rape and murder of}} 11-year-old Holly Staker. A number of pieces of evidence excluded Rivera, including DNA from the rape kit and the report from the <b>electronic</b> <b>ankle</b> <b>monitor</b> he was wearing at the time while awaiting trial for a non-violent burglary. However, he confessed after being interrogated by the police several days after taking two polygraph examinations at Reid and Associates. After his exoneration, Rivera filed a suit for false arrest and malicious prosecution. The case was settled out of court with John E. Reid & Associates paying $2 million.|$|E

5000|$|Despite his release, Haynesworth was {{dogged by}} the {{convictions}} {{for the two}} remaining cases; as new physical evidence was unavailable, these remained on his record. As a result, he was still listed on the state's sex offender registry. Because of this status, Haynesworth had to wear an <b>electronic</b> <b>ankle</b> <b>monitor,</b> be subject to curfews, inform authorities {{in order to move}} from one home to another, and had to request permission to visit his young nieces. Knowing how hard it would be for Haynesworth to find a job until he was fully exonerated, Cuccinelli hired him to work as a clerk in his office. Haynesworth said Cuccinelli was [...] "an extraordinary guy" [...] and that as [...] "a total stranger he put it on the line for me." [...] Cuccinelli had also invited Haynesworth to his office, where the State Attorney General personally apologized to him for the miscarriage of justice in his case.|$|E
50|$|Juan Rivera, a Waukegan, Illinois man, was wrongfully {{convicted of}} the 1992 {{rape and murder of}} 11-year-old Holly Staker. A number of pieces of {{evidence}} excluded Juan, including DNA from the rape kit and the report from the <b>electronic</b> <b>ankle</b> <b>monitor</b> he was wearing at the time while awaiting trial for a non-violent burglary, however, he confessed after being interrogated for several days using the Reid technique, a style of police interrogation that is known for its history of eliciting false confessions. His conviction was overturned in 2011 and the appellate took the unusual step of barring prosecutors from retrying him. Rivera filed a lawsuit against a number of parties, including John E. Reid & Associates, who developed the Reid technique. Reid contends that the false confession {{was the result of the}} Reid technique being used incorrectly. Rivera was taken to Reid headquarters in Chicago twice during his interrogation for polygraph tests, which were inconclusive, however, an employee named Michael Masokas told Rivera that he failed. The case was settled out of court with John E. Reid & Associates paying $2 million.|$|E
5000|$|In May 2014, a CIS {{report said}} that in 2013 Immigration and Customs Enforcement had [...] "freed 36,007 convicted {{criminal}} aliens from detention who were awaiting the outcome of deportation proceedings... {{the vast majority of}} these releases from ICE custody were discretionary, not required by law (in fact, in some instances, apparently contrary to law), nor the result of local sanctuary policies." [...] An ICE spokesman said that many such releases were required by law, for instance when a detainee's home country refuses to accept them or required by a judge's order. Caitlin Dickson, writing in the Daily Beast said that ICE had [...] "highlighted key points that CIS failed to address". Associated Press, however, when reporting on the CIS's figures, said that [...] "the releases that weren't mandated by law, including the 28 percent of the immigrants with homicide convictions, undermines the government's argument that it uses its declining resources for immigration enforcement to find and jail serious criminal immigrants who may pose a threat to public safety or national security." [...] CIS's report was criticized by the Immigration Policy Center of the American Immigration Council who said that [...] "looking at this group of people as an undifferentiated whole doesn’t tell you much about who poses a risk to public safety and who does not." [...] Muzaffar Chishti, the New York director of the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, said that the CIS report was [...] "a select presentation of a set of facts without any comparative analysis that can lead to misleading conclusions." [...] According to CBS, Gregory Chen of the American Immigration Lawyers Association said the report had “a lot of misleading information” and [...] "that the report's definition of criminals who have been 'released' includes those who are still subject to supervision including <b>electronic</b> <b>ankle</b> <b>monitoring</b> and regular check ins with ICE." ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is an ethnographic {{study of}} seeking political asylum in the United States. With {{the implementation of}} restrictive immigration measures, particularly following September 11, 2001, seeking asylum in the U. S. has become increasingly onerous and protracted. From an institutional standpoint, {{the goal of the}} asylum process is to discern 'deserving' migrants ('authentic' refugees) from 'undeserving' migrants ('bogus' asylum seekers, economic migrants), and the process is undergirded by a tension between humanitarian imperatives and concerns over national security and border control. Based on fifteen months of fieldwork in an urban area of the American Midwest, this dissertation explores the experiential dimensions of being embedded in this complex landscape, focusing on how contemporary configurations of power mediate self and social processes. The study uses data collected among a multi-national sample of asylum seekers, with a particular focus on asylum seekers from Cameroon. Data were also collected within institutional settings (among immigration advocates, attorneys, government officials, legal proceedings). This dissertation reveals that the asylum process evokes novel forms of suffering and modes of being-in-the-world. By lodging an asylum claim, migrants become both liminal (noncitizens whose legal status is to be determined) and (hyper) visible subjects who are 'managed' and policed via myriad techniques, ranging from barriers to employment and housing to tactics of surveillance and criminalization, including <b>electronic</b> <b>ankle</b> <b>monitoring</b> and detention. I argue that the asylum process entails a "paradox of visibility" : asylum seekers' (hyper) visibility is at once a promise of security and a powerful source of insecurity. A significant finding of this dissertation is that asylum seekers locate their suffering not in their traumatic pasts, but rather in the present moment - in the political asylum process itself. More specifically, I posit asylum seekers as occupying a particular temporal, subjective state of "existential limbo," in which life is understood as immobilized during the asylum process. In elaborating this existential state of being "stuck," I argue that although the institutional forces of asylum are powerful in shaping experience, they are not wholly determinate of it. Thus, this dissertation also explores how asylum seekers exercise agency and practice hope within this oppressive environmen...|$|R

5000|$|Following Janice Porter's death, Two-Face has {{her body}} left in Alberto's bed {{in order to}} trick him into {{thinking}} he had killed her. This time Scarecrow uses his fear toxins to make Alberto hallucinate that his father's voice is commanding him to commit suicide. Alberto then knows that the voice is not real [...] - [...] his father {{did not believe in}} suicide [...] - [...] and he exposes Calendar Man. What happens next is never explicitly shown, but later events suggest that Calendar Man shoots and wounds Alberto, at which point Sofia Falcone attacks Calendar Man, breaking his jaw and attaching her brother's <b>electronic</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>ankle</b> collar to him, leaving him unconscious outside the Falcone estate for Batman and the authorities to find (Gordon and Batman appear doubtful that Alberto could have injured the Calendar Man so badly himself). Sofia then takes her wounded brother to a hiding place in the Falcone mausoleum. There Sofia criticizes Alberto for complaining about the pain, recalling how Carmine had survived five shots to the chest. Alberto replies that he is not his father. Sofia, disgusted, agrees with this assessment and smothers him to death.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Drug {{courts are}} an {{alternative}} approach for drug offenders {{in the criminal justice}} system to reduce recidivism and drug use in adults. Residential community-based treatment has been shown to provide positive results for women in Drug Courts, but absconding from treatment is a common problem. In response to absconding, a number of Dallas County Drug Courts introduced mandated GPS tracking <b>ankle</b> <b>monitors</b> to increase drug treatment completion and drug court effectiveness. ^ Methods: We evaluated the effect of <b>ankle</b> <b>monitors</b> on drug treatment completion, positive urinalysis at any time in the first 6 months of drug court, continued drug use 6 months after starting drug court, and re-arrests/warrants in 31 women referred to residential drug treatment by the Dallas County Drug Courts using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression. ^ Results: Overall, 77. 4 % of women completed drug treatment, and 51. 6 % of women were re-rearrested or had a warrant for arrest 6 months after starting treatment. Women with <b>ankle</b> <b>monitors</b> were 0. 05 times less likely to be re-arrested or have an active arrest warrant compared to women without <b>ankle</b> <b>monitors</b> (OR 0. 05, p-value 0. 04). We also found a positive but not significant association between <b>ankle</b> <b>monitor</b> use and treatment completion (OR 9. 9; p-value 0. 14). ^ 32. 3 % of women had a positive urinalysis at some point during the first 6 months post-treatment and 16. 1 % was still using drugs and/or alcohol 6 months post-treatment. <b>Ankle</b> <b>monitors</b> did not affect positive urinalysis (OR 4. 2; p-value 0. 36) or continued drug use 6 months after starting drug court (OR 0. 32; p-value 0. 42). ^ Conclusion: <b>Ankle</b> <b>monitors</b> appear to reduce re-arrest, but not drug use, among women in Dallas Count Drug Courts. Drug Courts might consider using GPS-tracking <b>ankle</b> <b>monitors</b> to reduce re-arrests. Further research in a larger study population is needed to evaluate the long-term effect of <b>ankle</b> <b>monitors</b> on drug court completion, drug use and re-arrests/warrant 1 year after starting treatment. ...|$|R
