50|$|From 1951 on Bad Lausick {{was part}} of Geithain {{district}} and became {{the seat of the}} district court of law. In 1956 a rural department store (Landwarenhaus) opened on the market square, and in 1957 the romanic character of St Kilian church was restored. A Silbermann organ dating from 1722 and extended by Johann Gottlob Trampeli was installed in the church at the same time. Based on a document by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, the town celebrated its 800th anniversary in 1958. The spa was modernised again until 1962 and became a specialist sanatorium for cardiac and circulatory disorders in 1972. Former enterprises with state holdings were fully nationalized by that time, in particular the <b>house</b> <b>shoe</b> factory and the mill works. The school was extended in 1967/1968. The agricultural cooperatives of Bad Lausick, Ballendorf, Buchheim, and Ebersbach merged in 1976.

40|$|High-level {{regions of}} the ventral visual pathway respond more to intact objects {{compared}} to scrambled objects. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine if this selectivity for objects emerges at an earlier stage of processing. Visual areas (V 1 –V 3) were defined for each participant using retinotopic mapping. Participants then viewed intact and scrambled images from different object categories (bottle, chair, face, <b>house,</b> <b>shoe)</b> while neural responses were measured using fMRI. Our rationale for using scrambled images is that they contain the same low-level properties as the intact objects, but lack the higher-order combinations of features that are characteristic of natural images. Neural responses were higher for scrambled than intact images in all regions. However, the difference between intact and scrambled images was smaller in V 3 compared to V 1 and V 2. Next, we measured the spatial patterns of response to intact and scrambled images from different object categories. We found higher within-category compared to between category correlations for both intact and scrambled images demonstrating distinct patterns of response. Spatial patterns of response were more distinct for intact compared to scrambled images in V 3, but not in V 1 or V 2. These findings demonstrate the emergence of selectivity to natural images in V 3...|$|E
