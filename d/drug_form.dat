40|$|Background: Targeted toxins require {{multiple}} {{treatments and}} therefore must be deimmunized. We report {{a method of}} protein deimmunization based on the point mutation of highly hydrophilic R, K, D, E, and Q amino acids on the molecular surface of truncated diphtheria-toxin (DT 390). Methods: Based on their surface position derived from an X-ray-crystallographic model, residues were chosen for point mutation that were located in prominent positions on the molecular surface {{and away from the}} catalytic site. Mice were immunized with a targeted toxin containing either a mutated DT 390 containing seven critical point mutations or the non-mutated parental toxin form. Results: Serum analysis revealed a significant 90 % reduction in anti-toxin antibodies in mice immunized with the mutant, but not the parental <b>drug</b> <b>form</b> despite multiple immunizations. The experiment was repeated in a second strain of mice with a different MHC-haplotype to address whether point mutation removed T or B cell epitopes. Findings were identical indicating that B cell epitopes were eliminated from DT. The mutant <b>drug</b> <b>form</b> lost only minimal activity in vitro as well as in vivo. Conclusion: These findings indicate that this method may be effective for deimmunizing of other proteins and that discovery of a deimmunized form of DT may lead to the development of more effective targeted toxin...|$|E

40|$|We are {{conducting}} {{a series of}} experiments for the development of technology of Lagoden hemostatic gel obtaining. We studied different bases for the gel obtaining. According to the results, carbopol was selected as a gelling agent. By studying the change in the rheological properties of the gel and technological basis, a series of experiments were done to determine the concentration of a gelling agent and a neutralizing agent.  We worked on an optimal composition of the drug and a method for producing it in the technological process. Initially some substances like carbopol, sodium hydroxide, glycerin, purified water, and preservatives were used. Lagoden is a sodium salt trihydrate 3, 16, 18 -trihydroxy- 9, 13 -epoxilabdan- 15 -carboxylic acid. Lagoden is obtained by processing of Inebrin substance, which is obtained from a Lagochilus inebriansplant.  Lagochilus inebrians has been used  in folk medicine for a long time. The aim  of the work was to develop technology of obtaining of the soft <b>drug</b> <b>form</b> of Lagoden. Methods. Chemical reactions, me-thods of soft drug forms obtaining were used in the study. Results. Influence of different gel components on Lagoden gel were tested through various experiments. After studying of gel characteristics which on the basis of carbopol- 934 its alternative concentration for the formation of optimal gelwas defined. The experiments determined that the carbopol gel retained its physical state in the range of 5. 5 <pH < 8. 2.
