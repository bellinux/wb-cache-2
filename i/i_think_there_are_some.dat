It was pitiful to watch Vincent Jopp in his downfall. By {{the end of the}} first nine his lead had been reduced to one, and his antagonist, rendered a new man by success, was playing magnificent golf. On the next hole he drew level. Then with a superhuman effort Jopp contrived to halve the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth. It seemed as though his iron will might still assert itself, but on the fourteenth the end came.|$|E

I'm not strait-laced, but I am a clergyman's son, you know, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> things which are quite beyond the pale.

"It {{takes all}} sorts of people to make a world, as I've often heard, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> who could be spared," [...] Anne told her {{reflection}} in the east gable mirror that night. [...] "I wouldn't have mentioned the disgraceful thing to a soul anyhow, so my conscience is clear on THAT score. I really don't know who or what is to be thanked for this. I did nothing to bring it about, and it's hard to believe that Providence ever works by means of the kind of politics men like Judson Parker and Jerry Corcoran have." ...|$|E

I will not refer to [...] "Him who hath not Music in his soul," [...] but merely request the reader to recollect, for ten seconds, {{the features of the}} woman whom he believes to be the most beautiful; and, if he then does not comprehend fully what is feebly expressed in the above line, I shall be sorry for us both. For an eloquent passage in the latest work of the first female writer of this, perhaps of any, age, on the analogy (and the immediate comparison excited by that analogy) between [...] "painting and music," [...] see vol. iii. cap. 10, De l'Allemagne. And is not this connection still stronger with the original than the copy? with the colouring of Nature than of Art? After all, this is rather to be felt than described; still <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> who will understand it, at least they would have done had they beheld the countenance whose speaking harmony suggested the idea; for this passage is not drawn from imagination but memory,{A} that mirror which Affliction dashes to the earth, and looking down upon the fragments, only beholds the reflection multiplied! ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have not}} read through all Mr. Tennyson's poems, {{which have been}} sent to me; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> things of a good deal of beauty in what I have seen. The misfortune is, that he has begun to write verses without very well {{understanding}} what metre is. Even if you write in a known and approved metre, the odds are, if you are not a metrist yourself, that you will not write harmonious verses; but to deal in new metres without considering what metre means and requires, is preposterous. What I would, with many wishes for success, prescribe to Tennyson,--indeed without it he can never be a poet in act,--is to write for {{the next two or three}} years in none but one or two well-known and strictly defined metres, such as the heroic couplet, the octave stanza, or the octo-syllabic measure of the Allegro and Penseroso. He would, probably, thus get imbued with a sensation, if not a sense, of metre without knowing it, just as Eton boys get to write such good Latin verses by conning Ovid and Tibullus. As it is, I can scarcely scan some of his verses.|$|E
60|$|It {{was before}} sailing for America, as I have said, that I stood with the {{official}} paper {{in my hand and}} these thoughts in my head. It was while I stood on English soil that I passed through the two stages of smiling and then sympathising; of realising that my momentary amusement, at being asked if I were not an Anarchist, was partly {{due to the fact that}} I was not an American. And in truth <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> things a man ought to know about America before he sees it. What we know of a country beforehand may not affect what we see that it is; but it will vitally affect what we appreciate it for being, because it will vitally affect what we expect it to be. I can honestly say that I had never expected America to be what nine-tenths of the newspaper critics invariably assume it to be. I never thought it was a sort of Anglo-Saxon colony, knowing that it was more and more thronged with crowds of very different colonists. During the war I felt that the very worst propaganda for the Allies was the propaganda for the Anglo-Saxons. I tried to point out that in one way America is nearer to Europe than England is. If she is not nearer to Bulgaria, she is nearer to Bulgars; if she is not nearer to Bohemia, she is nearer to Bohemians. In my New York hotel the head waiter in the dining-room was a Bohemian; the head waiter in the grill-room was a Bulgar. Americans have nationalities at the end of the street which for us are at the ends of the earth. I did my best to persuade my countrymen not to appeal to the American as if he were a rather dowdy Englishman, who had been rusticating in the provinces and had not heard the latest news about the town. I shall record later some of those arresting realities which the traveller does not expect; and which, in some cases I fear, he actually does not see because he does not expect. I shall try to do justice to the psychology of what Mr. Belloc has called 'Eye-Openers in Travel.' But there are some things about America that a man ought to see even with his eyes shut. One is that a state that came into existence solely through its repudiation and abhorrence of the British Crown is not likely to be a respectful copy of the British Constitution. Another is that the chief mark of the Declaration of Independence is something that is not only absent from the British Constitution, but something which all our constitutionalists have invariably thanked God, with the jolliest boasting and bragging, that they had kept out of the British Constitution. It is the thing called abstraction or academic logic. It is the thing which such jolly people call theory; and which those who can practise it call thought. And the theory or thought is the very last to which English people are accustomed, either by their social structure or their traditional teaching. It is the theory of equality. It is the pure classic conception that no man must aspire to be anything more than a citizen, and that no man should endure to be anything less. It is by no means especially intelligible to an Englishman, who tends at his best to the virtues of the gentleman and at his worst to the vices of the snob. The idealism of England, or if you will the romance of England, has not been primarily the romance of the citizen. But the idealism of America, we may safely say, still revolves entirely round the citizen and his romance. The realities are quite another matter, and we shall consider in its place the question of whether the ideal will be able to shape the realities or will merely be beaten shapeless by them. The ideal is besieged by inequalities of the most towering and insane description in the industrial and economic field. It may be devoured by modern capitalism, perhaps the worst inequality that ever existed among men. Of all that we shall speak later. But citizenship is still the American ideal; there is an army of actualities opposed to that ideal; but there is no ideal opposed to that ideal. American plutocracy has never got itself respected like English aristocracy. Citizenship is the American ideal; and it has never been the English ideal. But it is surely an ideal that may stir some imaginative generosity and respect in an Englishman, if he will condescend to be also a man. In this vision of moulding many peoples into the visible image of the citizen, he may see a spiritual adventure which he can admire from the outside, at least as much as he admires the valour of the Moslems and much more than he admires the virtues of the Middle Ages. He need not set himself to develop equality, but he need not set himself to misunderstand it. He may at least understand what Jefferson and Lincoln meant, and he may possibly find some assistance in this task by reading what they said. He may realise that equality is not some crude fairy tale about all men being equally tall or equally tricky; which we not only cannot believe but cannot believe in anybody believing. It is an absolute of morals by which all men have a value invariable and indestructible and a dignity as intangible as death. He may at least be a philosopher and see that equality is an idea; and not merely one of these soft-headed sceptics who, having risen by low tricks to high places, drink bad champagne in tawdry hotel lounges, and tell each other twenty times over, with unwearied iteration, that equality is an illusion.|$|E

5000|$|Bango {{has been}} {{compared}} to Elvis Costello, a comparison he initially was uncomfortable with but has since accepted. [...] "I can see why people spot the influence but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> others that, to me seem just as obvious. But if people hear Costello that's A OK with me. I used to get worried about that but after trying to fight it for years I just decided that he was a bona fide influence". He also acknowledges the influence of Brian Wilson, Ray Davies and Charlie Rich and Jonathan Richman.|$|E
5000|$|The Soul Sessions Vol. 2 was {{recorded}} over two live recording sessions in New York City and Nashville. The album {{is a joint}} release between Stone's own independent label Stone'd Records and S-Curve Records, the label that released her first two studio albums, The Soul Sessions (2003) and Mind Body & Soul. Stone stated, [...] "I really had fun revisiting The Soul Sessions idea and I'm really pleased with the results. I've committed long term to my label Stone'd Records, but it felt right to team up with Steve Greenberg and S-Curve again for this release. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> great songs on the album and I loved performing them with such brilliant musicians." ...|$|E

But it's kind of absurd. I mean, it's just where we were at. We were a young band, a little pretentious, full of ambitions, full of grand ideas, {{and we wanted to}} see if we could make some of those grand ideas happen. And 'Fountain of Lamneth' was the first attempt to do that. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> beautiful moments, but a lot of it is ponderous and off the mark. It's also the most time we ever had to make a record. I think we had a full three weeks, and we were just indulging ourselves.'" ...|$|E

5000|$|After [...] "Power of a Love Song" [...] {{reached a}} peak of number 49 on the Billboard Country Airplay chart, no further singles were {{released}} from the album. Subsequently, in August 2013, after winning a record deal with Sony (RCA Nashville), Stevens parted ways with the label {{to take control of}} his musical destiny. “I really felt it was important to take control of my music,” continued Stevens. “Everyone on the business side was in a rush to get a record out and consequently I really wasn’t able to make the album I wanted to. It really was a pop approach and not a country music approach. And though <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> glimpses of what I wanted to achieve in the first album, I realized that if I was going to build on the experience of the show and have a long term career, I was going to need to {{follow in the footsteps of}} Kelly Clarkson and take control.” ...|$|E
5000|$|On 3 November 2008, WestJet {{commenced}} the airline's inaugural {{flight to}} Barbados. The main competitory of WestJet on this route is Air Canada. The airline announced {{the start of}} a four-flights per week schedule going from Toronto, Ontario to Barbados. During the post-inaugural flight ceremony held at the executive lounge of the Grantley Adams International Airport the Barbadian Minister of Tourism Richard Sealy said that the Barbados Tourism Authority was currently seeking to increase its tourism from Canada. He also offered opportunity to collaborate in the future with WestJet should they need a regional Caribbean hub. According to the Barbados Advocate newspaper Sealy stated [...] "We are game if Westjet is interested, in becoming the regional hub for more of your business and we would certainly like to see not four flights a week, but eventually, if we can have a daily service. Grantley Adams is already an established hub and we can feed business into the other territories. So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> possibilities for even greater levels of cooperation with Westjet" [...] he remarked to his Canadian counterparts.|$|E
5000|$|Schumacher's {{performance}} did not impress Hill {{after his}} defensive moves forced Hill to either back off or {{go off the}} track. Schumacher claimed that he had only blocked Hill at the low-speed corners, but video evidence suggested that Schumacher had blocked Hill {{on some of the}} high speed corners, such as the Radillion and Blanchimont. Hill later commented that [...] "We (he and Schumacher) had some pretty hairy moments and I am not satisfied with being driven into; I don't think that was acceptable. That is all well and good but if it was meant on purpose I would be very upset, F1 cars are not go-karts. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> things which are acceptable and some things which are not." [...] Schumacher defended himself by agreeing that touching wheels in high-speed corners is [...] "not acceptable" [...] but added that at the speed he and Hill were doing, he thought it was acceptable. Schumacher was given a one-race suspended ban for driving aggressively in order to stop Hill from passing.|$|E
