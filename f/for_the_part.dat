40|$|The optical {{constants}} of Hg xCd 1 -xTe as {{a function}} of energy and composition x are modeled over a wide spectral range from 1. 5 to 6 eV. The model employed represents an extension of Adachi's model and incorporates the adjustable broadening function rather than the conventional Lorentzian one. In this way, greater flexibility of the model is achieved, enabling us to obtain an excellent agreement with the experimental data. The relative rms errors obtained for all compositions are below 2. 5 % <b>for</b> <b>the</b> real <b>part</b> and below 6 % <b>for</b> <b>the</b> imaginary <b>part</b> of <b>the</b> index of refraction. The lowest rms errors are obtained for x = 0 (0. 6 % <b>for</b> <b>the</b> real <b>part</b> and 0. 7 % <b>for</b> <b>the</b> imaginary <b>part</b> of <b>the</b> index of refraction), and <b>the</b> highest <b>for</b> <b>the</b> x = 0. 91 (2. 4 % <b>for</b> <b>the</b> real <b>part</b> and 5. 8 % <b>for</b> <b>the</b> imaginary <b>part).</b> © 1999 American Institute of Physics. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

5|$|Cold Feet {{began its}} first {{series with the}} six main cast members—James Nesbitt, Helen Baxendale, John Thomson, Fay Ripley, Hermione Norris and Robert Bathurst—who had {{appeared}} in the pilot. Thomson's character Pete Gifford was written specifically for him after his performance in The Perfect Match made a positive impression on Christine Langan. Norris originally auditioned <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> of Rachel but was cast as Karen because the role suited her social class. Nesbitt got an audition through a mutual friend of pilot director Declan Lowney, and read the part in his natural accent because he was keen to play a Northern Irish character in a contemporary drama unconnected to The Troubles. Baxendale was best known for her role in Cardiac Arrest and was hesitant to star as Rachel because she did not believe she could perform comedy. Bathurst was known to Langan for his starring role in Joking Apart. Ripley thought she would be auditioning <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> of Rachel, and had to put on an accent for her role as natural Mancunian Jenny. When the fourth series was commissioned, Ripley announced that she was leaving the show to broaden her career options. Kimberley Joseph was cast as Jo Ellison, a replacement character who remained on screen until Cold Feets conclusion. Bullen makes numerous Hitchcock-esque cameo appearances; he plays a neighbour and a husband in the first series and a workman in the third.|$|E
