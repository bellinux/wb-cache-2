50|$|Under three {{treaties}} with the United States in 1833, 1843, and 1857, the Pawnee ceded {{all of their}} lands to the United States government except a reservation 10 mi wide by 30 mi long along the Loup River in Nebraska. After the state of Nebraska was admitted into the Union, the state government extinguished the tribe's rights to their land. It soon sold the land and used the proceeds to <b>defray</b> <b>expenses</b> <b>to</b> obtain lands elsewhere for the Indians. In the mid-1870s {{the remainder of the}} reservation was sold, and in 1876 the tribe was relocated to its present-day location in central Oklahoma.|$|E
50|$|The {{land that}} {{comprises}} Nance County was originally {{part of the}} Pawnee Reservation, created in 1857 when the Pawnee Indians signed a treaty with the United States ceding its lands {{in exchange for the}} reservation. After the state of Nebraska was admitted into the Union, the state government extinguished the tribe's rights to their land. It soon sold the land and used the proceeds to <b>defray</b> <b>expenses</b> <b>to</b> obtain lands elsewhere for the Indians. In the mid-1870s the remainder of the reservation was sold, and in 1876 the tribe was relocated to its present-day location in central Oklahoma. The boundaries for Nance County were approved in 1879. It was named after Governor Albinus Nance.|$|E
60|$|Having seen Eustacia's {{signal from}} the hill at eight o'clock, Wildeve {{immediately}} prepared to assist her in her flight, and, as he hoped, accompany her. He was somewhat perturbed, and his manner of informing Thomasin {{that he was going}} on a journey was in itself sufficient to rouse her suspicions. When she had gone to bed he collected the few articles he would require, and went upstairs to the money-chest, whence he took a tolerably bountiful sum in notes, which had been advanced to him on the property he was so soon to have in possession, <b>to</b> <b>defray</b> <b>expenses</b> incidental <b>to</b> the removal.|$|R

Starting from an old two story house {{in front of the}} Lazatin Vinegar Plant, now the school is conveniently located in a highly urbanized Sunset Subdivision in Barangay Cutcut.|$|R
60|$|Early in {{the morning}} Edward entered Calais in triumph, taking with him thirty French nobles as prisoners, while two hundred more {{remained}} dead on the field. That evening a great banquet was held, at which the French prisoners were present. The king presided at the banquet, and the French nobles were waited upon by the Black Prince and his knights. After the feast was concluded the king bestowed on De Ribaumont the chaplet of pearls which he wore round his crown, hailing him as the most gallant of the knights who had that day fought, and granting him freedom to return at once to his friends, presenting him with two horses, and a purse <b>to</b> <b>defray</b> his <b>expenses</b> <b>to</b> the nearest French town.|$|R
50|$|At many campuses, {{study abroad}} {{programs}} {{are run by}} multiple companies and non-profit institutes that offer colleges generous incentives to increase enrollments. An influential article that appeared in The New York Times in 2007 highlighted that this can include free and subsidized travel overseas for officials, back-office services <b>to</b> <b>defray</b> operating <b>expenses,</b> stipends <b>to</b> market the programs to students, unpaid membership on advisory councils and boards, and even cash bonuses and commissions on student-paid fees. This money generally goes directly to colleges, not always to the students who take the trips.|$|R

60|$|At New York I {{found my}} friend Collins, who had arriv'd there {{some time before}} me. We had been {{intimate}} from children, and had read the same books together; {{but he had the}} advantage of more time for reading and studying, and a wonderful genius for mathematical learning, in which he far outstript me. While I liv'd in Boston most of my hours of leisure for conversation were spent with him, and he continu'd a sober as well as an industrious lad; was much respected for his learning by several of the clergy and other gentlemen, and seemed to promise making a good figure in life. But, during my absence, he had acquir'd a habit of sotting with brandy; and I found by his own account, and what I heard from others, that he had been drunk every day since his arrival at New York, and behav'd very oddly. He had gam'd, too, and lost his money, so that I was oblig'd to discharge his lodgings, and <b>defray</b> his <b>expenses</b> <b>to</b> and at Philadelphia, which prov'd extremely inconvenient to me.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the later}} Medieval and early Renaissance periods, wealthy and {{powerful}} English noble houses sometimes maintained a troupe {{of half a}} dozen [...] "players," [...] just as noblemen kept jesters or jugglers for entertainment. English theatre benefited greatly from the predilection for theatricality displayed by the Tudors. Henry VII kept a company of players called the [...] "Lusores Regis", which probably consisted of four men and a boy who were used to swift costume changes and multiple roles. In the early period the difference between players, acrobats and other entertainers was not hard and fast. A troupe of players, however, was more costly to keep than a jester; players (who usually had other household duties as well) could <b>defray</b> <b>expenses</b> by touring <b>to</b> various cities and performing for profit a practice that began the evolution away from the medieval model of noble patronage and toward the commercial and capitalistic model of modern entertainment. It is from the scattered records of such touring, and from occasional performances at the English Royal Court, that our very limited knowledge of English Renaissance theatre in the early and middle 16th century derives.|$|R

"Well, yes; in a way, of course, that {{is quite}} true, Mr. Quiverful; and when we know how very {{inadequate}} are the incomes of the working clergy, we cannot but feel ourselves to be, if I may so say, put upon, when we have <b>to</b> <b>defray</b> the <b>expenses</b> incidental <b>to</b> special duties out of our own pockets.

[...] This was ungrateful {{on the part of}} Mr. Thumble, who had been permitted to ride miles upon miles to various outlying clerical duties upon the bishop's worn-out cob. [...] "You see," [...] continued Mr. Thumble, [...] "you and I go specially to represent the palace, and the palace ought to remember that.

2500|$|In July 1982, {{the city}} {{purchased}} {{most of the}} land in a complex deal with the Academy and the US Forest Service. The City paid the Academy $23.9 million, raised by a bond issue supported by a temporary ¼ percent sales tax. The City retained part of the land, which is now the 640 acre (2.6km²) Elena Gallegos Picnic Area/Albert G. Simms Park, located {{at the feet of the}} Sandias at the mouths of Bear and Pino Canyons. The 7,000 acre (28km²) plus remainder of the purchase, most of it forest land in the canyons proper, was sold to the Forest Service, and is now part of the Cibola National Forest and the Sandia Mountain Wilderness. The Academy retained two parts of the tract, the larger adjoining Tramway Boulevard. The school set up the High Desert Investment Corporation (HDIC) to develop this portion as the master-planned community known as High Desert. (The smaller portion, within Bear Canyon itself, is still used by the Academy for experiential education purposes.) HDIC then purchased a large tract of land in the northern section of Rio Rancho, which it is currently developing as Mariposa. The proceeds from the land sales and from HDIC have provided the Academy with a substantial endowment, which is used partly <b>to</b> <b>defray</b> tuition <b>expenses</b> and <b>to</b> subsidize a significant need-based financial aid program.|$|R
