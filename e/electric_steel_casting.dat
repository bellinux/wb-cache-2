40|$|This {{cross-sectional}} study {{was aimed at}} evaluating in a large sample of male foundry workers the current exposure levels to carcinogenic compounds, including metallic elements [arsenic (As), beryllium (Be), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni) ] and aromatic polycyclic hydrocarbons (PAH) by a biological monitoring approach, using validated biomarkers of exposure. Workers were recruited from 15 aluminium, copper alloy, <b>electric</b> <b>steel</b> and <b>cast</b> iron foundries and provided an end-of-shift urine sample to determine urinary concentrations of As, Be, Cd, Cr, Ni and 1 -hydroxypyrene (1 -OHP). Metallic elements were determined either by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (Be, Cd and Cr) or by atomic absorption spectrometry (As, Ni), whereas 1 -OHP was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography with fluorimetric detection. Most of the determinations fell within the laboratory's reference values. Age and lifestyle habits (smoking, alcohol, diet) played a significant interfering role...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The inverse problem {{consisting}} in {{the identification}} of volumetric latent heat of <b>steel</b> <b>cast</b> is presented. Additionally it is assumed that the courses of temperature at the points from the casting or mould are known. The substitute thermal capacity of <b>steel</b> <b>cast</b> (this parameter is directly connected with the latent heat) is approximated by the fourth-degree polynomial. In order to solve the inverse problem the least squares criterion containing the sensitivity coefficients is applied. In the final part of the paper the results of computations are shown. Design/methodology/approach: In this work numerical modelling of solidification process is applied. A <b>steel</b> <b>cast</b> solidifying in a sand mould is analyzed. The information concerning the course of cooling curve at the selected point from the casting domain is used in order to identify the latent heat of <b>steel</b> <b>cast.</b> Findings: It is shown that only one sensor located at the optional point from casting or mould domain gives the information sufficient for successful identification of unknown parameter. Research limitations/implications: Further work requires an introducing of real temperature measurements to the model presented. Practical implications: The paper shows the possibilities of thermophysical parameters identification on the basis of temperature measurements. In the case considered the latent heat of <b>steel</b> <b>cast</b> has been identified. Originality/value: The algorithm presented allows to identify the latent heat {{in the case of the}} complex, temperature dependent function determining the substitute thermal capacity of metallic alloy...|$|R
