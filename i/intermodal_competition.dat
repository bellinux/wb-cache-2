State commissions are often charged with monitoring competitive conditions in their states and adapting policy to changing conditions. Failure to consider the competitive effect of wireless and broadband services in local telephone markets will bias competitive analyses towards concluding that incumbent wireline providers have more market power than they actually do and lead to more intervention than is necessary to achieve public interest outcomes. Conversely, assuming that the availability of wireless and broadband services automatically makes local telephone markets workably competitive will bias competitive analyses towards concluding that incumbent wireline providers have less market power than they actually do and lead to less intervention than is necessary to achieve public interest outcomes. Assessing competitive conditions in a market and determining whether a firm or group of firms has market power requires defining the market in product and geographic terms, determining which producers and consumers {{are part of the}} market, measuring market shares and/or other indicators of the competitiveness of the market, and making a determination as to whether the market is or is not workably competitive.

40|$|The Telecommunications Act of 1996 {{has yielded}} more {{litigation}} and less local competition than its supporters expected or intended. Calls for its reform are multiplying. The article diagnoses the 1996 Act 2 ̆ 7 s failings and prescribes {{a framework for}} reform. The successful deregulations of the transportation industries and of long-distance telecommunications (precedents the 1996 Act sought to follow) demonstrate that the Act should have taken additional steps to promote intermodal telecommunications competition. Transportation deregulation successfully prompted competition where (as {{in the case of}} airlines and trucking) multiple firms could compete on an intramodal basis or where (as in the case of railroads) the single firm was subject to <b>intermodal</b> <b>competition</b> from firms using other technologies. The 1996 Act 2 ̆ 7 s reliance on the unbundling of incumbent local telephone companies 2 ̆ 7 networks reveals that its supporters thought that portions of the local wireline networks would remain bottlenecks. The lesson, therefore, is that the 1996 Act should have taken additional steps to create the conditions for <b>intermodal</b> <b>competition.</b> Based on this analysis, the article outlines a new communications law that increases the possibilities for <b>intermodal</b> <b>competition.</b> Indeed, the glimmers of hope for local competition - cell phone substitution and voice-over-Internet-protocol (VoIP) telephony - are intermodal competitors. Although the 1996 Act did move in this direction and the Federal Communications Commission is vigorous on several fronts, more can be done. Spectrum reform (the most significant missed opportunity in the 1996 Act) and other steps would decrease legal and economic barriers to <b>intermodal</b> <b>competition.</b> The article also addresses local and state control of telecommunications carriers, regulatory parity, universal service reform, and government funding of research and infrastructure, and it offers a technology-neutral regulatory scheme for VoIP.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} effects of network {{unbundling}} in telecommunications. It includes discussions of the basic economics of unbundling; the competitive effects of unbundling on voice services in the US and broadband in the US and the European Union; and unbundling policy {{in a world of}} convergence. Mandatory unbundling can delay facilities-based entry and reduce network investment, particularly if unbundled input prices are set too low. Excessive prices for essential network elements could hamper competitive entry. Some argue that mandatory unbundling has stimulated competition; however, the results suggest that when relevant demand and supply determinants are included in the analysis, the association between mandatory unbundling and increased broadband penetration is not statistically significant. Assessing {{the costs and benefits of}} unbundling is more difficult because of convergence and <b>intermodal</b> <b>competition</b> among the video, wireless and telephone providers. Thus, the dynamic nature of the sector and the costs of implementing mandatory unbundling imply that policy makers should carefully examine the costs and benefits of regulatory intervention.

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} extent and {{importance}} of rate competition among railroads for the export shipment of three narrowly defined agricultural commodities since passage of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which increased the railroads' freedom to set rates. I construct measures of intermodal and intramodal competition, and find that each has strong impacts on rail rates. The farther a shipper is from competing water transportation, the more considerably rates rise. Rates fall as railroad competition in a region increases. There appears to be some interaction between intermodal and intramodal competition. I find that the competitive effects of two proposed rail mergers depend on the vigor of <b>intermodal</b> <b>competition</b> from truck and water transport and on the change in interrailroad competition that results from the reduced number of competing rail systems. ...|$|E

Using a comprehensive data set of all firm and route entries and exits, we find that the industry grew much quicker than originally expected - with particularly a few new entrants being most successful in quickly extending their route networks from regional to national coverage. Although the clear majority of routes is operated on a monopoly basis, competition does play a key role on routes with a sufficiently large base of (potential) customers. From a spatial perspective, three years after deregulation, the entire interurban bus network connects 60 percent of all 644 larger German cities - with the intensity of entry being dependent on the number of inhabitants, average income, the share of under 24 years old and the presence of <b>intermodal</b> <b>competition</b> by intercity railway services...|$|E
40|$|The {{future of}} {{interurban}} public transport will be significantly affected by public sector decisions concerning investment in infrastructure, particularly {{the construction of}} new high-speed rail lines in medium-distance corridors where cars, buses, airplanes and conventional trains are the competing modes of transport. The distribution of traffic between the alternative modes of transport depends on the generalized prices, which fundamentally consist of costs, time and government’s pricing decisions. High-speed rail investment, financed by national governments and supranational institutions such as the European Union (EU), has drastically changed the previous equilibrium in the affected corridors.
