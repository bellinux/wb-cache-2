5|$|Modern {{furnaces}} {{are equipped}} {{with an array of}} supporting facilities to increase efficiency, such as ore storage yards where barges are unloaded. The raw materials are transferred to the stockhouse complex by ore bridges, or rail <b>hoppers</b> and ore transfer cars. Rail-mounted scale cars or computer controlled weight <b>hoppers</b> weigh out the various raw materials to yield the desired hot metal and slag chemistry. The raw materials are brought {{to the top of the}} blast furnace via a skip car powered by winches or conveyor belts.|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers have a {{wide range}} of predators at {{different}} stages of their lives; eggs are eaten by bee-flies, ground beetles and blister beetles; <b>hoppers</b> and adults are taken by other insects such as ants, robber flies and sphecid wasps, by spiders, and by many birds and small mammals.|$|E
5|$|The many {{inhabitants}} of the tidal flats include lugworms, polychaete worms, sand <b>hoppers</b> and other amphipod crustaceans, and gastropod molluscs. These molluscs feed on the algae growing {{on the surface of}} the mud, and include the tiny Hydrobia, an important food for waders because of its abundance at densities of more than 130,000m−2. Bivalve molluscs include the edible common cockle, although it is not harvested here.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hopper</b> was {{originally}} named Warren, Illinois. The village {{was laid out}} by Lambert <b>Hopper</b> on March 25, 1840. It was often called <b>Hopper's</b> Mill in the 19th century because Lambert <b>Hopper</b> and his son, Wesley <b>Hopper,</b> operated a thriving lumber mill in the area.|$|R
5|$|The {{last four}} wheeled open wagons {{were built in}} 1958, but were not {{scrapped}} in large numbers until the 1980s when new bogie wagons replaced them. In 1987 the bogie wagon fleet numbered 5000, with approximately 700 grain <b>hoppers,</b> 800 container flats, 1000 louvred vans, 700 open wagons, 400 tank cars, and 300 flat wagons. Today the broad gauge intrastate fleet numbers 2600, {{with large numbers of}} louvred vans, open and flat wagons, and tank cars stored or scrapped due to the transfer of traffic to road following years of apathy by Governments.|$|E
5|$|From the <b>hoppers,</b> {{the waste}} falls onto the furnace-charging chute {{and from there}} onto the incinerating grate. Here it is burned at a {{temperature}} in excess of 1,200°C. This heat is then converted into super heated steam through the plant's boilers. This in turn powers steam turbines, much {{in the same way}} as a conventional thermal power station. Electricity is generated at 11 kilovolts. After exiting the turbines, the steam is condensed back to water. For the original two incinerating lines use river water from the Tees as a cooling medium, whereas in the third line, water is condensed through air cooled condenser. The cooled water is treated and reused in the boilers.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{people could}} {{do little to}} protect their crops from being devastated by locusts, {{although}} eating the insects {{may have been some}} consolation. By the early 20th century, efforts were being made to disrupt the development of the insects by cultivating the soil where eggs were laid, collecting <b>hoppers</b> with catching machines, killing them with flamethrowers, trapping them in ditches, and crushing them with rollers and other mechanical methods. By the 1950s, the organochloride dieldrin was found to be an extremely effective insecticide, but it was later banned from use in most countries because of its persistence in the environment and its bioaccumulation in the food chain.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hopper</b> barges {{are seen}} in two {{distinctive}} types; raked <b>hopper</b> or box <b>hopper</b> barges. The raked <b>hopper</b> barges move faster than the box hoppers; they are both designed for movement of dry bulky commodities.|$|R
25|$|In 1999, Rip Torn filed a {{defamation}} {{lawsuit against}} <b>Hopper</b> over a story <b>Hopper</b> told on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. <b>Hopper</b> claimed that Torn pulled a knife on him during pre-production {{of the film}} Easy Rider. According to <b>Hopper,</b> Torn was originally cast in the film but was replaced with Jack Nicholson after the incident. According to Torn's suit, it was actually <b>Hopper</b> who pulled the knife on him. A judge ruled in Torn's favor and <b>Hopper</b> was ordered to pay US$475,000 in damages. <b>Hopper</b> then appealed but the judge again ruled in Torn's favor and <b>Hopper</b> was required to pay another US$475,000 in punitive damages.|$|R

5|$|Locust plagues {{can have}} devastating effects on human {{population}}s, causing famines and population upheavals. They are mentioned {{in both the}} Koran and the Bible and have also been held responsible for cholera epidemics, resulting from the corpses of locusts drowned in the Mediterranean Sea and decomposing on beaches. The FAO and other organisations monitor locust activity around the world. Timely application of pesticides can prevent nomadic bands of <b>hoppers</b> from forming before dense swarms of adults can build up. Besides conventional control using contact insecticides, biological pest control using the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium acridum, which specifically infects grasshoppers, has been used with some success.|$|E
5|$|Waste {{arriving}} at the plant is checked in and weighed, before being delivered to the plant's reception hall. The large reception hall allows the vehicles to dump their waste safely. Air for the combustion of the waste later in the plant is drawn from the reception hall so that odour and dust doesn't pollute the building's surroundings. From the hall waste is tipped into a large concrete bunker. Here the feedstock is homogenefied by a crane operator, who mixes and removes unsuitable waste. A grab crane then manoeuvers waste from the bunker to the <b>hoppers</b> that feed the furnace. This crane is operated from a control room. This room also monitors the equipment in the plant, the combustion gases and maximises {{the efficiency of the}} plant.|$|E
5|$|When the GWR {{was opened}} no trains in the United Kingdom were fitted with vacuum brakes, instead handbrakes were fitted to {{individual}} wagons and trains also conveyed brake vans where a guard had {{control of a}} screw-operated brake. The first goods wagons to be fitted with vacuum brakes were those that ran in passenger trains carrying perishable goods such as fish. Some ballast <b>hoppers</b> were given vacuum brakes in December 1903, and general goods wagons were constructed with them from 1904 onwards, although unfitted wagons (those without vacuum brakes) still formed {{the majority of the}} fleet in 1948 when the railway was nationalised {{to become a part of}} British Railways.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{cultural}} and social differences between local communities, lindy <b>hoppers</b> have much in common. They not only share specific dance forms, but also dance cultures. There is great enthusiasm for social dancing in most lindy hop communities (with of course allowance for regional variation), and lindy <b>hoppers</b> are often keen travellers. The lindy exchange culture which developed in the United States and Canada, coupled with a European enthusiasm for holiday camps has seen the development of many large events held throughout the world, which not only attract local dancers but also visitors from other communities. There is a strong culture of hospitality in lindy hop culture today.|$|E
25|$|In {{species such}} as the Coleopteran family Lampyridae, the males fly in the {{darkness}} and emit a species-species specific pattern of light flashes, which are answered by perching receptive females. The color and temporal variation of the flash {{contribute to the success}} in attracting females. Acoustic signals are produced by many groups including several orthopeteran species, neuropterida, cicadas, flies, cave planthroppers, leaf <b>hoppers,</b> and tree <b>hoppers.</b> In crickets and other Orthopeterans, loudness and/or uninterrupted songs often attract more females. In other insects, females may choose a mate in relation to aspects of his songs. In any case, it is possible that females compare the songs of several males before making a choice.|$|E
25|$|Despite these {{differences}} in taste, lindy hop is historically and practically associated with artists such as Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald, Benny Goodman, Chick Webb, Lionel Hampton and so on. Lindy <b>hoppers</b> are particularly fond of big band arrangements by and featuring these (and other) musicians.|$|E
40|$|This study aims to reframe the {{consideration}} {{and appreciation of}} Edward <b>Hopper’s</b> art focusing on the 1940 s. The thesis proposes that <b>Hopper</b> should be categorised as a Modernist. This notion was explored by selecting and critically evaluating literature and original paintings by <b>Hopper.</b> The literature utilised for this research included: materials covering the social, political and economic circumstances of post-depression America, Art Historical critique of <b>Hopper’s</b> work and life, and the philosophical theories which influenced Modernism at the time. These theories, in particular Existentialism and Feminist writing, are here applied to <b>Hopper’s</b> own work. The research provided {{evidence to support the}} initial proposal, and helped draw clear comparisons between Abstract Expressionism (Modernism) and <b>Hopper’s</b> work. The investigation opened up new lines of enquiry, predominantly the relevance of Existential and Modern Man theories to <b>Hopper’s</b> work. The argument follows a journey which began by analysing Edward <b>Hopper</b> in terms of the social context of the 1940 s, through different mediums commonly identified as modern, (such as film noir), which are used as a comparison. Existentialism is applied as a way of looking at ‘the individual’ in three distinct areas: <b>Hopper</b> himself, the figures depicted in his paintings and the viewer of those paintings. Once these notions of the individuals and their relationships to <b>Hopper</b> and the Modern are clarified, the last segment addresses gender issues in relation to <b>Hopper</b> and Modernism. The final discourse investigates the relationship between <b>Hopper’s</b> work and gender theories, notably Feminist critiques of notions of masculinity and femininity, focusing on three distinct areas: <b>Hopper’s</b> own gender, the genders <b>Hopper</b> depicts and the gender of the viewer of <b>Hopper’s</b> work. The whole analysis is based on Jean-Paul Sartre’s description of the possibility of stepping outside of Bad Faith into existential authenticity and demonstrates how this is observable in <b>Hopper’s</b> work. This enables the thesis to argue the necessity and importance of <b>Hopper’s</b> recognition as a Modernist...|$|R
