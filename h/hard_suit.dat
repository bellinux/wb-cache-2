50|$|This {{aluminum}} <b>hard</b> <b>suit</b> has fully articulated, rotary joints in {{the arms}} and legs that give the pilot a great range of mobility. These joints operate freely at high pressures. At the time the suit was constructed, {{it was the first}} of its kind in this regard. The pilot can control objects and handle tools with manipulator jaws at the ends of the arms. Although the suit is certified to 300 metres, it has been tested to 900 metres.|$|E

5000|$|Hard-shell {{suits are}} usually made of metal or {{composite}} materials {{and do not}} use fabric for joints. <b>Hard</b> <b>suits</b> joints use ball bearings and wedge-ring segments similar to an adjustable elbow of a stove pipe to allow {{a wide range of}} movement with the arms and legs. The joints maintain a constant volume of air internally and do not have any counter force. Therefore, the astronaut does not need to exert to hold the suit in any position. <b>Hard</b> <b>suits</b> can also operate at higher pressures which would eliminate the need for an astronaut to pre-breathe oxygen to use a [...] space suit before an EVA from a [...] spacecraft cabin. The joints may get into a restricted or locked position requiring the astronaut to manipulate or program the joint. The NASA Ames Research Center experimental AX-5 hard-shell space suit had a flexibility rating of 95%. The wearer could move into 95% of the positions he or she could while nude.|$|R
40|$|NASA-Ames Research Center {{developed}} the Suitport as an advanced space suit airlock {{to support a}} Space Station suit based on the AX- 5 <b>hard</b> <b>suit.</b> Several third parties proposed their own variations of the Suitport {{on the moon and}} Mars. The Suitport recently found its first practical use as a terrestrial application in the NASA-Ames Hazmat vehicle for the clean-up of hazardous and toxic materials. In the Hazmat application, the Suitport offers substantial improvements over conventional hazard suits by eliminating the necessity to decontaminate before doffing the suit...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{orbiting}} satellites, spent components, collisions and explosions have populated the near earth orbit with debris potentially more hazardous {{than the average}} meteoroid debris. This new debris has an average density of aluminum (2. 78 g/cc) and an average encounter velocity of 10 km/sec. The space station will require many hours of work in this environment and there is concern over hazard to the assembly personnel. A proposed <b>hard</b> <b>suit</b> design utilizes 6061 -T 6 Aluminum {{for most of its}} exposed area. The aluminum surface will be treated for thermal and radiation control. The basic thickness of this suit will be on the order of 1. 78 mm (0. 070 inches). The selection of 6061 -T 6 Aluminum for space suits for use on the space station would appear to be worthwhile. The relatively ductile behavior of 6061 -T 6 aluminum is better than a choice of a more brittle material...|$|E
40|$|Space Station {{operations}} and maintenance {{are expected to}} make unprecedented demands on astronaut EVA. With Space Station expected to operate with an 8 to 10 psi atmosphere (4 psi for Shuttle operations), the effectivness of pressurized gloves is called into doubt {{at the same time}} that EVA activity levels are to be increased. To address the need for more frequent and complex EVA missions and also to extend the dexterity, duration, and safety of EVA astronauts, NASA Ames and Stanford University have an ongoing cooperative agreement to explore and compare alternatives. This is the final Stanford/Ames report on manually powered Prehensors, each of which consists of a shroud forming a pressure enclosure around the astronaut's hand, and a linkage system to transfer the motions and forces of the hand to mechanical digits attached to the shroud. All prehensors are intended for attachment to a standard wrist coupling, as found on the AX- 5 <b>hard</b> <b>suit</b> prototype, so that realistic tests can be performed under normal and reduced gravity as simulated by water flotation...|$|E

5000|$|A former engineer, Nigel {{worked on}} the Boomer Project with Sylia's father and Brian J. Mason, then later helped Sylia design and build the <b>hard</b> <b>suits.</b> Now a mechanic, he helps {{maintain}} the <b>hard</b> <b>suits.</b> He is romantically involved with Sylia, but because of his quiet, sullen nature he is called the [...] "man of a thousand grunts" [...] by other characters and his true feelings for Sylia are unknown. Mackey becomes his protege {{and one of the}} few people Nigel seems to consider a friend. At the beginning of the series, Priss appears to be infatuated with him, though he does not react to her flirtations. However, he later creates a [...] "Motoslave" [...] (motorcycle that can transform into an exoskeleton for Priss's hardsuit) specifically for her that, using Nigel's voice, says it wishes to protect Priss. Both Priss and Sylia are attracted to Nigel, however, Nigel never showed preference for either one. However, Sylia was more emotionally desperate to have Nigel and Priss gave up on Nigel since she has Leon. Nigel would later build more advanced Hard-Suits for the ladies in their battle against the mad-boomers and eventually Galatea.|$|R
40|$|A <b>hard</b> <b>suit</b> for use {{in space}} or diving {{applications}} having an adjustable length torso covering that will fit a large variety of wearers is described. The torso covering comprises an upper section and a lower section which interconnect so that the covering will fit wearers with short torsos. One or more sizing rings may be inserted between {{the upper and lower}} sections to accommodate larger torso sizes as required. Since access of the astronaut to the torso covering is preferably through an opening {{in the back of the}} upper section (which is closed off by the backpack), the rings slant upward-forward from the lower edge of the opening. The lower edge of the upper covering section has a coupler which slants upward-forward from the lower edge of the back opening. The lower torso section has a similarly slanted coupler which may interfit with the upper section coupler to accommodate the smallest torso size. One or more sizing rings may be inserted between the coupler sections of the upper and lower torso sections to accommodate larger torsos. Each ring has an upper coupler which may interfit with the upper section coupler and a lower coupler which may interfit with the lower section coupler...|$|E
40|$|The risk of EVAs is {{critical}} to the decision of whether or not to automate {{a large part of the}} construction of the International Space Station (ISS). Furthermore, the choice of the technologies of the space suit and the life support system will determine (1) the immediate safety of these operations, and (2) the long-run costs and risks of human presence in space, not only in lower orbit (as is the case of the ISS) but also perhaps, outside these orbits, or on the surface of other planets. The problem is therefore both an immediate one and a long-term one. The fundamental question is how and when to shift from the existing EMU system (suit, helmet, gloves and life support system) to another type (e. g. a <b>hard</b> <b>suit),</b> given the potential trade-offs among life-cycle costs, risks to the astronauts, performance of tasks, and uncertainties about new systems' safety inherent to such a shift in technology. A more immediate issue is how to manage the risks of EVAs during the construction and operation of the ISS in order to make the astronauts (in the words of the NASA Administrator) "as safe outside as inside". For the moment (June 1997), the plan is to construct the Space Station using the low-pressure space suits that have been developed for the space shuttle. In the following, we will refer to this suit assembly as EMU (External Maneuvering Unit). It is the product of a long evolution, starting from the U. S. Air Force pilot suits through the various versions and changes that occurred for the purpose of NASA space exploration, in particular during the Gemini and the Apollo programs. The Shuttle EMU is composed of both soft fabrics and hard plates. As an alternative to the shuttle suit, at least two hard suits were developed by NASA: the AX 5 and the MRKIII. The problem of producing hard suits for space exploration is very similar to that of producing deep-sea diving suits. There was thus an opportunity to develop a suit that could be manufactured for both purposes with the economies of scale that could be gained from a two-branch manufacturing line (space and deep sea). Of course, the space suit would need to be space qualified. Some of the problems in adopting one of the hard suits were first that the testing had to be completed, and second that it required additional storage space. The decision was made not to develop a <b>hard</b> <b>suit</b> in time for the construction and operation of the ISS. Instead, to improve the safety of the current suit, it was decided to reinforce the soft parts of the shuttle EMU with KEVLAR linings to strengthen it against debris impacts. Test results, however, show that this advanced suit design has little effect on the penetration characteristics...|$|E

40|$|Past space {{suits and}} the current Shuttle suit, which are {{constructed}} primarily from fabric, use the Integrated Thermal and Micrometeoroid Garment, which insulates the astronaut from his environment. The new generation of <b>hard</b> <b>suits</b> affords designers the opportunity to incorporate thermal control into the suit structure. Environmental influence on the suit temperature and heat flux can then be minimized with a high reflectance coating. Candidate coatings have been identified and ranked {{on the basis of}} thermophysical properties; wear, corrosion and atomic oxygen degradation resistance; and coating process and cost. Laboratory determination of properties, thermal cycling and wear resistance tests are underway to identify the optimum coating. A computer model is being developed to evaluate various environmental configurations. Preliminary results are presented here...|$|R

5000|$|Like the Mark III and the Generation III I-Suit, the [...] "Configuration Two" [...] suit {{will use}} a rear-entry hatch design, {{eliminating}} the need for the dual-plane closure used on the Shuttle/ISS EMU suits and unlike the current NASA suit, a hybrid of both the Apollo A7L/A7LB suits and the Litton-developed RX-series <b>hard</b> <b>suits,</b> will be of a [...] "soft-suit" [...] design, allowing astronauts to bend over and grasp objects when fully suited and pressurized. New joint designs on the [...] "Configuration Two" [...] suits, along with the soft-suit elements from the [...] "Configuration One" [...] suits, will allow the suits to operate at a higher pressure (around 8.0 psi/552 hPa, the pressurization used on the Orlan space suit), eliminating the danger of undergoing decompression sickness normally associated with the lower pressure of the Shuttle/ISS suits (which operates at 4.3 psi/296 hPa).|$|R
50|$|An enigmatic billionaire, and {{the founder}} of the Knight Sabers, Sylia is the {{daughter}} of Dr. Katsuhito Stingray, the man who invented Boomers. Implants in her brain were used to create both Galatea and Mackey and her brain patterns were used in the creation of Boomers thus strongly relating her to boomers, but she sees them as an abomination as her mother did. She acts as ground support for the Knight Sabers. She is in love with Nigel Kirkland, a sullen mechanic who was an engineer on the Boomer project who helped her design and build the <b>hard</b> <b>suits.</b> Sylia owns and operates an upscale clothing boutique called Silky Doll, which also serves as a front for the Knight Sabers HQ. Sylia suffers from regular flashbacks; most stem from her extremely complicated and disturbing childhood involving her mother's death and the cruel experiments her father conducted on her. She rarely dons her hardsuit or enters combat.|$|R

5000|$|ILC began {{delivering}} spacesuits for the Apollo {{program in}} 1966. Initial deliveries of suits {{did not perform}} well in tests and NASA initially cancelled its contract with ILC and Hamilton Standard. NASA relaunched the program to develop a spacesuit for the Apollo program experimenting at first with <b>hard</b> <b>suits.</b> ILC and Hamilton Standard submitted competing designs this time with ILC winning the sole contract based on its flexible, close-fitting design which featured water cooled undergarment, a blue inner pressurized layer, and covered in a white nylon layer to protect the suits from rocks. Hamilton received a separate contract for the life support backpack unit. ILC was further challenged after the Apollo 1 fire to remove all flammable material from space suits. After a nationwide search, ILC settled on beta cloth, a fireproof silica fiber cloth. [...] Apollo spacesuits were custom-made {{for each of the}} astronauts in the program, and for each of the twelve manned flights carried out, ILC produced fifteen suits. Three suits were made {{for each of the three}} astronauts comprising the crew (one suit for flight, one for training, one for back-up) and two suits were made for each of the three back-up crew members (one suit for flight and one for training). Twenty extra-vehicular activities (EVAs) were performed during the Apollo program, and ten were performed during Skylab. The Apollo suits were used for a total of 160 hours on the lunar surface.|$|R

50|$|The Mark III is a rear-entry suit, {{unlike the}} EMU {{currently}} in use, {{which is a}} waist-entry suit. The suit incorporates a mix of <b>hard</b> and soft <b>suit</b> components, including <b>hard</b> upper torso, hard lower torso and hip elements made of graphite/epoxy composite, bearings at the shoulder, upper arm, hip, waist, and ankle, and soft fabric joints at the elbow, knee, and ankle.|$|R
50|$|Flexibility of {{the human}} anatomy is another design issue, and which also affects the design of {{unpowered}} <b>hard</b> shell space <b>suits.</b> Several human joints such as the hips and shoulders are ball and socket joints, with the center of rotation inside the body. It is difficult for an exoskeleton to exactly match the motions of this ball joint using a series of external single-axis hinge points, limiting flexibility of the wearer.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} evaluation of the “gestural joystick, ” a wearable 2 -D pointing controller for mobile robots in hazardous environments that uses hand gestures. Hazardous environments, {{such as that of}} a collapsed building search, require operators to wear a significant amount of protective clothing. This protective clothing, which may include <b>hard</b> hats, <b>suits,</b> gloves, goggles, etc., reduces comfort, mobility, dexterity, load capacity, and ability to interact with conventional computer input devices. The gestural joystick, which is embedded in protective clothing, mitigates some of these impacts, but at the cost of lesser familiarity for the user and, therefore, potentially lesser performance. Effective performance metrics are required to evaluate this interface mechanism. Path tortuosity has been proposed as a performance metric for the evaluation o...|$|R

In this paper, M. Nerlove-type dynamic model was improved so that parameter itself was set as {{the function of the}} time variable. The problem of multicollinearity was arisen in this case. Therefore the best model avoided multicollinearity was found by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient for variables. The results estimated by this model are following. Income and price elasticities of meat were decreasing tendency every year. The habit formation effect increased every year little by little.

40|$|An elbow or {{knee joint}} for a <b>hard</b> space <b>suit</b> or similar usage is formed of three {{serially}} connected rigid sections which have truncated spherical configurations. The ends of each section form solid geometric angles, and the sections are interconnected by hermetically sealed ball bearings. The outer two sections are fixed together for rotation {{in a direction}} opposite to rotation of the center section. A preferred means to make the outer sections track each other in rotation comprises a rotatable continuous bead chain which engages sockets circumferentially spaced on the facing sides of the outer races of the bearings. The joint has a single pivot point and the bearing axes are always contained in a single plane for any articulation of the joint. Thus flexure of the joint simulates the coplanar flexure of the knee or elbow and is not susceptible to lockup...|$|R
40|$|Shoulder and hip joints for <b>hard</b> space <b>suits</b> are {{disclosed}} which are comprised of three serially connected truncated spherical sections, {{the ends of}} which converge. Ball bearings between the sections permit relative rotation. The proximal {{end of the first}} section is connected to the torso covering by a ball bearing and the distal end of the outermost section is connected to the elbow or thigh covering by a ball bearing. The sections are equi-angular and this alleviates lockup, the condition where the distal end of the joint leaves the plane in which the user is attempting to flex. The axes of rotation of the bearings and the bearing mid planes are arranged to intersect in a particular manner that provides the joint with a minimum envelope. In one embodiment, the races of the bearing between the innermost section and the second section is partially within the inner race of the bearing between the torso and the innermost spherical section further to reduce bulk...|$|R
