40|$|Redefining of {{agricultural}} extension service delivery has been considered lately as an essential option to remedy the decline in efficient organization, administration and delivery of extension due to so many challenges facing effectiveness of the system. Agriculture is an important {{sector of the economy}} with high potentials for employment generation, food security and poverty reduction. These potentials has remained largely untapped which has led to the dwindling performance of the sector both domestically and in the international trade over years. The Nigerian government seeks to exploit these potentials through her Agricultural Transformation Agenda (ATA). The major challenges of Nigeria’s agricultural extension and advisory services have been identified to include: lack of a legislated agricultural extension policy, compounded by policy somersaults; grossly inadequate and untimely funding; poor leadership and coordination, low private sector participator, very weak Research-Extension-Farmer-Inputs Linkages system and driven by ineffective top-down, supply-driven, extension approaches. The Nigerian agricultural extension system should properly fit into the ATA road map to address the critical challenges {{of agricultural}} extension and advisory services to transform it into a participatory, demand-response, market-oriented and ICT driven service that will provide for all the extension needs of all actors along the targeted commodity value chains of interest. Three key features are essential; inclusion of all farmers as target beneficiaries; effective <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>farmers</b> ’ extension service needs, and an accountability system to provide better {{agricultural extension service}}s to farmers.

40|$|A Bayesian belief network (BBN) was {{developed}} to assess preferred combinations of trees in live fences and on pastures in silvopastoral systems. The BBN was created with information from Rivas, Nicaragua, using local farmer knowledge on tree species, trees' costs and benefits, farmers' expressed needs and aspirations, and scientific knowledge regarding tree functional traits and their contribution to ecosystem services and benefits. The model identifies combinations of trees, which provide multiple ecosystem services from pastures, improving their productivity and contribution to farmer livelihoods. We demonstrate how the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> portfolios of multifunctional trees can satisfy a profile of desired ecosystem services prioritized by the farmer. Diagnostics using Bayesian inference starts with an <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>farmer</b> needs and ‘works backwards’ to identify a silvopastoral system structure. We conclude that Bayesian belief networks are a promising modeling technique for multi-criteria decisions in farm adaptation processes, where interventions must be adapted to specific contexts and farmer preferences.

The <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>farmer</b> groups that are successful today helps develop tomorrow’s effective groups. This case study examines characteristics associated {{with the success of}} community seed production groups in multiplying and disseminating high-yielding maize seed in Timor-Leste. Previous research from Timor-Leste indicates that the likelihood of an individual adopting a new variety is strongly related to the closeness of social relationships with growers already using that variety. This research explored the hypothesis that social capital, that is social relationships within a farmer group, can be leveraged for development through seed production groups. The groups were established in 2011 for seed production as part of the National Seed System for Released Varieties primarily through previously existing farmer groups. After 2  years, in 2013, a survey was conducted on 30 seed production groups. Successful groups produced sufficient seed for multiplication at a larger scale the following year, as well as surplus seed for distribution to group members or for sale. Several characteristics were correlated with the quantity of shared seed distributed to individual group members, as a measure of group effectiveness: meeting frequency, with r of 0. 69; the number of positive leadership traits, with r of 0. 57; the level of group trust, with r of 0. 51; and the number of defined management roles within the group, with r of 0. 41. These traits all reflect the strength of social capital and group governance.

40|$|International audienceLandscape spatial {{organization}} (LSO) strongly impacts {{many environmental}} issues. Modelling agricultural landscapes and describing meaningful landscape patterns are thus regarded as key-issues for designing sustainable landscapes. Agricultural landscapes are mostly designed by farmers. Their decisions dealing with crop choices and crop allocation to land can be generic {{and result in}} landscape regularities, which determine LSO. This paper comes within the emerging discipline called "landscape agronomy", aiming at studying the organization of farming practices at the landscape scale. We here aim at articulating the farm and the landscape scales for landscape modelling. To do so, we develop an original approach consisting in the combination of two methods used separately so far: the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> explicit <b>farmer</b> decision rules through on-farm surveys methods and the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> landscape stochastic regularities through data-mining. We applied this approach to the Niort plain landscape in France. Results show that generic farmer decision rules dealing with sunflower or maize area and location within landscapes are consistent with spatiotemporal regularities identified at the landscape scale. It results in a segmentation of the landscape, based on both its spatial and temporal organization and partly explained by generic farmer decision rules. This consistency between results {{points out that the}} two modelling methods aid one another for land-use modelling at landscape scale and for understanding the driving forces of its spatial organization. Despite some remaining challenges, our study in landscape agronomy accounts for both spatial and temporal dimensions of crop allocation: it allows the drawing of new spatial patterns coherent with land-use dynamics at the landscape scale, which improves the links to the scale of ecological processes and therefore contributes to landscape ecology...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss {{inclusiveness}} <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> among <b>farmers</b> in Galicia (Spain) and The Netherlands. Identification with three nested categories - farmers in the local community, farmers in the country, and farmers in Europe was assessed among 167 Dutch and 248 Galician farmers at three points in time: winter of 1993 / 94, winter 1995 and fall 1995. Our findings suggest that inclusiveness reduces the level <b>of</b> <b>identification.</b> However, the observed patterns <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> were more complex than inclusiveness per se can account for. Borrowing from the common ingroup-identity model, functional and socialization models of identity formation, and a model of politicized collective identity we formulated hypotheses about patterns <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> that were to be expected. On the whole our findings supported our theoretical reasoning. Galician farmers appear to identify much less with farmers in their country and Europe than Dutch <b>farmers</b> do. Inclusiveness <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> appears {{to be linked to}} experience with national and supranational political institutions.

This is because the local adaptive choices practiced by the farmers are either substitutive or supplementary of one another. Even if the univariate probit model is possible to estimate the adaptive choices <b>of</b> <b>farmers</b> on the available alternative measures, it is prone to bias due to neglecting the common factors that are not observable and unmeasured.

40|$|International audienceTo {{face the}} problem of {{groundwater}} depletion, the Indian Government relies on large projects of Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR). Numerous recharge structures such as percolation tanks exist but {{the impact of these}} structures on groundwater resources remains poorly understood. Although the evaporation/infiltration ratio of percolation tanks was determined in several studies in semi-arid contexts using surface water balance methods, few studies evaluated the impact on the aquifer recharge. However, knowledge on recharge dynamics over time and space is essential for (1) the quantitative evaluation of stored water volumes, (2) the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> beneficiaries (<b>farmers)</b> and (3) the estimation of percolation tanks recharge zone to the extent that is required to define proper management regulations at basin scale. These three points are of prime importance in the case of semi-arid regions where a limited number of rain events determine the water stored over the entire year. Assessment of the stored groundwater is even more difficult in crystalline aquifers due to the heterogeneous structure of flow paths. To date no methodological guidelines exist for local assessment of percolation tanks in crystalline aquifers. In this paper, we develop a method for calculating a local groundwater budget and we compare it with a computed surface balance. The method is applied to a case study in semi-arid crystalline context. From the groundwater balance we draw conclusions on (1) the limited amount of stored water in the aquifer, (2) the delayed recharge of the aquifer highlighting temporary storage/slow groundwater movement in the unsaturated zone and (3) the limited number of beneficiaries in years of medium monsoon rainfall. These results complement the understanding of the hydrodynamic functioning of percolation tanks, and their impact on the local groundwater balanc...|$|R

40|$|An {{environment}} {{conducive to}} a viable emerging agricultural sector is developing in South Africa, {{but it has}} yet to benefit most resource-poor producers. Some of the crucial constraints are accessibility and affordability of resources and services. Centrally managed agricultural projects as the main historical development model have largely {{failed to live up to}} the expectation that this would be the 'cutting edge' of development. This paper argues that the failure of these projects was partly due to four criteria for development not being sufficiently incorporated into project design and implementation: technical aspects of a project must be reconciled with social structures and realities; farmer diversity must be dealt with through focused support; business linkages must be structured and maintained; and skills development and participation must be institutionalised. Two of these criteria - dealing with diversity and facilitating participation - are elaborated on through a case study in the North West Province of South Africa. Typology analysis led to the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> four distinct <b>farmer</b> types and this was followed by a Logical Framework planning process to develop a unique support strategy for each type.
