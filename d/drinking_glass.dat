500|$|When Halliday died in June, {{parliament}} was in recess. As {{a result}} of this, a writ could not be issued until parliament reconvened in the winter. This extended the election campaign to run for six months, causing major disruption to the wool trade in the town. In his History of Taunton, Joshua Toulmin reported that {{the length of the}} campaigning allowed [...] "the display of every manoeuvre, and the exertion of every power, by which the parties could counteract each other's views." [...] A lot of money was spent {{on both sides of the}} election; in addition to the £3,000 which Maxwell said he was willing to spend, the government put forward £3,675 of secret service money for his campaign. Both men had plates and mugs made which were given free to the voters, generally full of food and drink. A number of delft plates bearing the enscription [...] "Sir John Pole for ever" [...] still exist, and one such plate sold for over £2,000 in 2011. A <b>drinking</b> <b>glass</b> with a similar inscription is housed at the British Museum in London. The public houses became aligned to one of the two candidates, and much of the campaign money was placed into these to gain their support. Toulmin lamented that [...] "the houses of entertainment were kept open during all this time; [...] habits of idleness and licentiousness were formed." [...] In a letter to Lord Sackville, Maxwell wrote that the election campaign involved [...] "a great deal of smoking, some drinking, and kissing some hundreds of women." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{claim is}} the name is from the large {{drinking}} glasses used by Dutch seamen known as rummers, from the Dutch word roemer, a <b>drinking</b> <b>glass.</b> Other options include contractions of the words iterum, Latin for [...] "again, a second time", or arôme, French for aroma.|$|E
2500|$|Bezoars had value {{because they}} were {{believed}} to have {{the power of a}} universal antidote against any poison.

2500|$|Diseases {{that are}} {{transmitted}} primarily by oral means may be caught through direct oral contact such as kissing, or by indirect contact such as by sharing a <b>drinking</b> <b>glass</b> or a cigarette.

50|$|The term verrophone {{originally}} {{referred to}} a glass harp. Previous glass instruments include the glass harmonica and arrangements of ordinary <b>drinking</b> <b>glasses</b> (approximately glass tubes closed at one end). The verrophone is capable of louder dynamics than the glass harp due to its larger radiating surfaces.|$|R

2500|$|The Thompson-inspired {{character}} Uncle Duke {{appears on}} a recurring basis in Doonesbury, the daily newspaper comic strip by Garry Trudeau. When the character was first introduced, Thompson protested, quoted {{in an interview}} as saying that he would set Trudeau on fire if the two ever met, although {{it was reported that}} he liked the character in later years. Between March 7, 2005 (roughly two weeks after Thompson's suicide) and March 12, 2005, Doonesbury ran a tribute to Hunter, with Uncle Duke lamenting the death of the man he called his [...] "inspiration". The first of these strips featured a panel with artwork similar to that of Ralph Steadman, and later strips featured various non-sequiturs (with Duke variously transforming into a monster, melting, shrinking to the size of an empty <b>drinking</b> <b>glass,</b> or people around him turning into animals) which seemed to mirror some of the effects of hallucinogenic drugs described in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.|$|E
2500|$|Workers {{discovered}} a cavity {{in one of}} the walls when the castle was being partially demolished in 1815; this contained four small urns, a painted <b>drinking</b> <b>glass</b> and a large jaw bone, possibly of an ox. [...] Two of the urns had handles and all were tightly closed with shreds or trimmings of woven cloth. [...] One of the urns contained the breast and side bones of a chicken and the others a sort of greasy soil. [...] A coin was found in the grounds near the old tower, bearing the legend 'FESTINA LENTE' ('Make Haste Slowly'); other details being too worn too make out. No explanation has been put forward for these articles presence here. [...] A portion of the castle survives, about 20 feet long and 25 feet in height, forming the north elevation of the walled garden. It has an elliptical gun port in it and a rectangular window. Some square bee bole recesses are also present.|$|E
2500|$|Although Cheap Thrills {{sounded as}} if it {{consisted}} of concert recordings, like on [...] "Combination of the Two" [...] and [...] "I Need a Man to Love", only [...] "Ball and Chain" [...] was actually recorded {{in front of a}} paying audience; the rest of the tracks were studio recordings. The album had a raw quality, including the sound of a <b>drinking</b> <b>glass</b> breaking and the broken shards being swept away during the song [...] "Turtle Blues". Cheap Thrills produced very popular hits with [...] "Piece of My Heart" [...] and [...] "Summertime". Together with the premiere of the documentary film Monterey Pop at New York's Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts on December 26, 1968, the album launched Joplin's successful, albeit short, musical career. Cheap Thrills reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 album chart eight weeks after its release, remaining for eight (nonconsecutive) weeks. The album was certified gold at release and sold over a million copies in the first month of its release. The lead single from the album, [...] "Piece of My Heart", reached No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the fall of 1968.|$|E

60|$|Margaret {{talked and}} laughed {{as much as}} her husband, but Susie could not tell whether this {{animation}} was affected or due to an utter callousness. Her voice seemed natural enough, yet it was inconceivable {{that she should be}} so lighthearted. Perhaps she was trying to show that she was happy. The supper proceeded, and the lights, the surrounding gaiety, the champagne, made everyone more lively. Their host was in uproarious spirits. He told a story or two at which everyone laughed. Oliver Haddo had an amusing anecdote handy. It was a little risky, but it was so funnily narrated that everyone roared but Arthur, who remained in perfect silence. Margaret had been <b>drinking</b> <b>glass</b> after glass of wine, and no sooner had her husband finished than she capped his story with another. But whereas his was wittily immoral, hers was simply gross. At first the other women could not understand to what she was tending, but when they saw, they looked down awkwardly at their plates. Arbuthnot, Haddo, and the other man who was there laughed very heartily; but Arthur flushed to the roots of his hair. He felt horribly uncomfortable. He was ashamed. He dared not look at Margaret. It was inconceivable that from her exquisite mouth such indecency should issue. Margaret, apparently quite unconscious of the effect she had produced, went on talking and laughing.|$|E
