25|$|The Royal Navy {{preferred}} to upgrade to the Poseidon missile, {{increasing the number}} of warheads from three per missile to between ten and thirteen of a newer and lighter design. In this case a single Resolution could launch up to 208 warheads, guaranteeing that some would <b>get</b> <b>through.</b> <b>This</b> option also had the advantage of maintaining commonality with the US Navy, as well as offering greater range, and thus increasing the safety of the launch submarines.|$|E
25|$|The Maginot line {{required}} {{a large number}} of fixed anti-tank artillery, which was easily disrupted by artillery shelling or smoke screens. Flexible lines use mixed natural and artificial anti-tank obstacles; tanks and other armored vehicles could not get through these well-planned defense lines on their own, especially if the design take advantage of the natural relief and objects. The most effective protection provided by double or triple U trenches on hillsides, because enemy's artillery can not destroy an indentation. Armored troops can only <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> line with AVLBs or extensive engineering operations, which is relatively easy to counteract.|$|E
25|$|For his part, Ya`qub {{traveled}} through Khuzistan, {{during which he}} gained the defection of a former general of the caliph's, Abi'l-Saj Devdad, and entered Iraq. The caliphal general Masrur al-Balkhi managed to slow down his progress by flooding the land outside Wasit, but the Saffarid army was able to <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> and he entered Wasit on March 24. Leaving Wasit, he set for the town of Dayr al-`Aqul, which was about fifty miles from Baghdad. According to one source, Ya`qub did not actually expect the caliph to offer battle; instead he would give in to any demands that the Saffarid had. Al-Mu'tamid, however, sent al-Muwaffaq to stop him. The two armies met at Istarband, between Dayr al-`Aqul and Sib Bani Kuma.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the first}} {{appointments}} Harrison was forced to reverse was that of James S. Clarkson as an assistant postmaster. Clarkson, who had expected a full cabinet position, began sabotaging the appointment from the outset, gaining the reputation for [...] "decapitating a fourth class postmaster every three minutes". Clarkson himself stated, [...] "I am simply on detail from the Republican Committee...I am most anxious to <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> task and leave."

500|$|Instigated by Kushner's wife, Velvet Revolver reunited for a one-off {{performance}} with Scott Weiland at a benefit concert {{for the late}} John O'Brien, on January 12, 2012. Following a benefit show for the Road Recovery in 2011 with the other Velvet Revolver members, each one agreed to a one-off reunion before Kushner invited Weiland, who also agreed. Kushner also stated it was then unknown what Velvet Revolver's plans were for the future after the reunion show; [...] "I know everyone’s got other commitments, but I think everyone’s like, 'Let’s get this thing done and <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> and then we’ll see.'".|$|E

When one of Vonnegut's characters, Kilgore Trout, finds the question [...] "What is the purpose of life?" [...] written in a bathroom, his response is, [...] "To be the eyes and ears and conscience of the Creator of the Universe, you fool." [...] Marvin finds Trout's theory curious, given that Vonnegut was an atheist, and thus for him, there is no Creator to report back to, and comments that, [...] " [...] Trout chronicles one meaningless life after another, readers are left to wonder how a compassionate creator could stand by and do nothing while such reports come in." [...] In the epigraph to Bluebeard, Vonnegut quotes his son Mark, and gives an answer to what he believes is the meaning of life: [...] "We are here to help each other <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> thing, whatever it is." ...|$|E

[...] Kaufman noted that Jackson became more forceful during the chorus, when he sang, [...] "You're the one that makes me strong / I can't make it another day / You're the fire that keeps me warm / I can't make it another day." [...] The journalist also noted the lyrical and melodical similarities between [...] "Another Day" [...] and [...] "Storm", which features Kravitz singing, [...] "I walked away but I was wrong / You're the one that keeps me strong / You're the fire that keeps me warm / How will I <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> storm?" ...|$|E
500|$|Philip Andelman {{directed}} the music video for [...] "Lips Are Movin". It was filmed in Los Angeles. It premiered on Trainor's Vevo account on November 19, 2014. Trainor told [...] MTV News, [...] "Here's me being sassy {{and other people}} dancing with me and having just {{a good time and}} trying to <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> feeling of, Ugh he's cheating on me again". The video was commissioned by information technology corporation Hewlett-Packard. It features several [...] "influencers"—actors, dancers and set designers with large social media followings. The influencers featured in the video include set designer Bri Emery; actors Marcus Johns, Cody Johns, and Robby Ayala; YouTube star Liza Koshy; dancers Les Twins; Spanish stylist Sara Escudero; hair stylist Kristin Ess; Japanese nail artist Mei Kawajiri; American dancer Chachi Gonzales; and Pomeranian dog Barkley the Pom. Andelman suggested showcasing behind-the-scenes events occurring during a music video shoot, which was used as the video's theme. Trainor's team asked the ad agency 180LA to make the music video similar to [...] "All About That Bass" [...] and not stray too far from it.|$|E
500|$|The writers for {{the season}} worked in Los Angeles, with {{one member of the}} writing team on set in New York for filming. Actress Carrie-Anne Moss talked about how the scripts {{developed}} through the production of the season, explaining that the dialogue usually did not change much while filming, but scenes were altered to accommodate the filming locations when necessary. Rosenberg stated that, since Jones is a private investigator, there would be some procedural elements to the show, [...] "but that’s not our focus. There are cases. In particular, there is a large case that carries over the season." [...] Elaborating on this, Marvel Television head Jeph Loeb said that the [...] "fun about being a private detective is that the line between what’s legal and what’s not legal gets very blurred....her drive is not always necessarily to solve the case, {{as much as it is}} to go, 'Okay, can I pay the rent? How am I going to <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> day?'" [...] He also added that inspiration {{for the season}} came from [...] "the noir films from the ‘40s" [...] and [...] "film like Chinatown." ...|$|E

500|$|Eno {{has also}} said the album is about [...] "paint {{a picture of the}} human trying to survive in an {{increasingly}} digital world" [...] and Byrne considered his job as lyricist to [...] "bring more humanity" [...] to Eno's instrumentals, which can be [...] "cold and academic." [...] Themes of humanity struggling with technology are apparent on several tracks and Byrne has characterized the [...] "overall vibe" [...] of the album as [...] "We're going to <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>this.</b> Humanity will prevail." [...] The lyrical content includes [...] "a sinister inflection" [...] but [...] "many songs feel fairly uplifting and the overall tone is hopeful." [...] Byrne focused on mundane events and attempted to write in a style that was [...] "simple but not corny, basic but heartfelt." [...] His inspiration in writing lyrics for [...] "OneFineDay" [...] was the story of ValentinoAchakDeng as told in DaveEggers' —the two are thanked in the liner notes and Byrne had previously performed at a fundraiser for Eggers' 826Valencia. The story of the LostBoys of Sudan is emblematic of the spiritual themes of the album as they go through [...] "all kinds of unrelenting horrors, but [...] eternally hopeful and even cheerful, in a way that defies all logic." [...] The music on this album also expresses homesickness—a lyrical trend that is apparent in Byrne's work with TalkingHeads.|$|E
500|$|Cooder {{recorded}} most of Election Special at Drive-By Studios, {{the living}} room of engineer Martin Pradler's house in North Hollywood. Sessions also took place at Wireland Studios in Chatsworth, California. Pradler later mixed and mastered the album at both recording locations. The album was produced entirely by Cooder. He performed most of the album himself, playing bass, guitar, and mandolin. His son Joachim contributed on drums, and session musician Arnold McCuller sung harmony vocals on the song [...] "Take Your Hands off It". At Drive-By Studios, Cooder recorded songs in a series of unrehearsed, single-take performances, which he felt helped him channel the songs' respective characters more efficiently. He later said of his approach to developing the songs, [...] "The way I think these songs can work is if you don't ponder over it too hard, because the tunes wanna have a spontaneous-combustion effect. What I want to do is get a certain attitude in the voice, and I can only do that once. By take two, I'm startin' to think about it. By take three, I'm startin' to map it out – it's gone. It's spoiled, y'see? So I need to <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> fast." [...] He first recorded the song [...] "The Wall Street Part of Town" [...] in November 2011.

500|$|Three {{reviewers for}} Computer Gaming World had {{conflicting}} reactions. Ken St. Andre—designer of the Tunnels & Trolls RPG—approved {{of the game}} despite his dislike of the D system, praising the art, the mixture of combat and puzzles, and surprises. He concluded, [...] "take it from a 'rival' designer, Pool of Radiance has my recommendation for every computer fantasy role-playing gamer". Tracie Forman Hicks, however, stated that over-faithful use of the D system left it behind others like Ultima and Wizardry. She also disliked the game's puzzles and lengthy combat sequences. Scorpia also disliked the amount of fighting in a game she otherwise described as a [...] "well-designed slicer/dicer", concluding that [...] "patience (possibly of Job) [...] required to <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> one". Shay Addams from Compute! stated that experienced role-playing gamers [...] "won't find anything new here", but recommended it to those who [...] "love dungeons, dragons, and drama". In their March 1989 [...] "The Role of Computers" [...] column in Dragon magazine #143, Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser (often called [...] "The Lessers") gave Pool of Radiance a three-page review. The reviewers praised Pool of Radiance as [...] "the first offering that truly follows AD game rules", calling it a [...] "great fantasy role-playing game" [...] that [...] "falls into the must-buy category for avid AD game players". The reviewers advised readers to [...] "rush out to your local dealer and buy Pool Of Radiance". They considered it SSI's flagship product, speculating that it would [...] "undoubtedly bring thousands of computer enthusiasts into the adventure-filled worlds of TSR". The Dragon reviewers criticized the [...] "notoriously slow" [...] technology of the C64/128 system but added that the C64/128 version would become nearly unplayable without a software-based fastloader utility which Strategic Simulations integrated into the game. Conversely, the reviewers felt that the MS-DOS version was extremely fast, {{so much so that}} they had to slow the game operation down in order to read all the on-screen messages. They found that the MS-DOS version played at twice the speed of the C64/128 version when using the Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) graphics mode.|$|E

Darabont {{did not want to}} attempt conveying on screen the protagonist being involved in an extramarital affair. The characters in the film, portrayed by Thomas Jane and Laurie Holden respectively, instead share a more emotional relationship. Jane explained, [...] "We kind of form a little family, sort of surrogate family where my son and I'm a father and she becomes the mother to the son. We become a little unit as we're trying to <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> nightmare together." [...] Holden compared the nightmare to what refugees experienced at the Louisiana Superdome during Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
