50|$|Blue&Me is a {{new feature}} first {{introduced}} with the Fiat Grande Punto and is fitted as standard on the Bravo Dynamic and Sport. Developed with Microsoft, this system offers Bluetooth hands free use with a mobile phone. It is also capable of displaying SMS text on the <b>dash</b> <b>screen,</b> and it has built in voice activation. Another {{part of the system}} is the inclusion of a USB connector so that an MP3 player or USB flashcard can be plugged in, giving the car's entertainment system access to MP3 files stored on the unit.|$|E

50|$|The film is {{sometimes}} cited, {{as on the}} DVD release of the 1952 Singin' in the Rain, as the movie {{that led to the}} downfall of Gilbert's career. Gilbert, a popular silent film actor best known for his work opposite Garbo, possessed a pleasant tenor speaking voice which didn't always match his heroic, <b>dashing</b> <b>screen</b> image. In Hollywood Revue he plays the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet with Norma Shearer, first straight, then for laughs with contemporary slang. It is possible, though, that the negative effect of the film on Gilbert's career has been overstated, since many contemporary reviews made no criticism of his performance. His problems really began with the next two films he made, His Glorious Night (1929) and Redemption (1930).|$|R
5000|$|Typing in a swear {{word would}} {{generate}} the message [...] "Mary is not amused..." [...] and a dwarf would <b>dash</b> onto the <b>screen</b> to punch the player. Mary {{could be found}} in El Vinos but killing her achieved little as she would return within a minute.|$|R
50|$|Astal also {{includes}} a 2-Player cooperative mode, with a second player controlling the bird. The bird can strike at the enemy with wings and beak using the B button, launch an arrow attack by holding down and then releasing the B button, or dive bomb the enemy by pressing and holding the C button while using left and right on the D-pad to control direction. The bird can also <b>dash</b> across the <b>screen</b> by pressing left or right twice and holding.|$|R
50|$|A large, 8.8-inch {{monitor in}} the center of the {{dashboard}} displays all the information the driver needs, apart from the speedometer and tachometer, which are conventional analog instruments. The monitor is positioned within the driver's field of vision, allowing it to be viewed while focusing attention on the road ahead. Controls are operated with a single large, multifunction knob located between the front seats. The control (called the Intuitive Interaction Concept) consists of a combination rotary and push button for selecting functions. Confirmation of the selected mode is displayed on the <b>dash</b> mounted <b>screen.</b> Several hundred functions can be controlled with this device. The concept of operating the Z9, which BMW calls Intuitive Interaction Concept, allows the driver to easily activate functions while driving without the need to constantly examine and manipulate conventional controls. It was an early prototype of the series production iDrive, introduced in 2001 on the BMW 7 Series (E65).|$|R
50|$|The Player {{is given}} a {{selection}} of characters to choose from, namely, Jazz, Spaz, and eventually (in the subsequent expansions) Lori. Each character has certain traits that are exclusive to each other. For an example, Jazz can launch himself vertically higher than others, Spaz can double jump, and Lori can <b>dash</b> across the <b>screen</b> whilst eliminating almost any enemy or obstacle in her path. Each Character {{is equipped with a}} gun that can fire an inexhaustible supply of projectiles in a straight manner. During the course of the game, however, the player can encounter additional ammunition that can provide the player with greater fire-power and range but with limiting ammo. These ammo types can result in different effects from flamethrowing to firing ice shards (that freezes almost any enemy or object on contact).|$|R
500|$|Epsilon-Eagle can run, double jump, hover in the air, and use six {{different}} types of weapons. Only four can be equipped at any given time, but the player may choose which weapons {{they would like to}} equip before the game starts. Each gun has its own ammunition bar which can be replenished; if it's depleted the player will be left with a little firepower. The player can also perform a <b>dash</b> across the <b>screen,</b> which when at full health, will become a deadly move called [...] "Phoenix Force" [...] that will damage any enemies in its path. There is also a counter move, that if timed properly, will change enemy bullets into health. Epsilon-Eagle can attack in either fixed-fire or free-moving styles. The first makes him immovable while firing a weapon, instead allowing for quick aiming, while the second allows walking and shooting simultaneously with the sacrifice of directional accuracy.|$|R
