5|$|Unlike most Bollywood films which {{indulge in}} months of {{promotion}} before the release, Aashiqui 2 {{had less than}} three weeks for promotion before its release.

The makers of the film launched the Aashiqui 2 jackets, as seen in the film's poster. Statues resembling the signature image of the couple <b>hiding</b> <b>under</b> the jacket were placed inside various theatres. Due to the romantic theme of the film, it was originally planned for a Valentine's day release on 14 February 2013, but this was postponed because of production delays. The film's new release date was 10 May 2013, but it was released a fortnight early on 26 April 2013 in over 2800 screens across India. The film was not released in key markets such as UK, US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
