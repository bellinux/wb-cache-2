5|$|On August 22 & 23, 1869, Carpenter {{and other}} troopers became {{involved}} in a fierce attack by Kiowa and Naconee Indians, who were focused on destroying the buildings and settlement on the Anadarko Reservation. Carpenter, with Troops H and L, patrolled the area aggressively and engaged several groups of warriors who were setting prairie fires upwind of the settlement at different points. Further and increasingly violent assaults {{were made by the}} Native Americans, in numbers ranging from 50 to 500 at different points of the defensive lines. The decisive feature of the engagement was a charge made by Captain Carpenter's troopers. His men routed a body of over 150 warriors, who were about to take up a commanding position <b>in</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> other defenders. On June 5, 1872, the 10th left Fort Sill to elements of the 3rd Infantry and proceeded back to Fort Gibson.|$|E

25|$|The nearly {{simultaneous}} attack upon Wagnelée by the 5th Brigade (Tippelskirch's), {{previously mentioned}} as having taken post <b>in</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> that village, {{was not as}} successful as the counterattack on Saint-Amand-la-Haye.|$|E
25|$|It {{was at this}} {{critical}} period of the battle, that the 2nd Battalion of the 1st Westphalian Landwehr, which still continued in reserve, <b>in</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> Brye, {{under the command of}} Captain Gillnhaussen, appeared upon the height in front, where it particularly distinguished itselt In the first place it succeeded in checking, by its vigorous fire, the French Cuirassiers, who were in pursuit of the Prussian infantry. Then it drove back French Cavalry which was on the point of making a fresh attack upon the Prussian dragoons. Afterwards it successfully withstood three charges by the Imperial Guard cavalry. General Grolman then ordered this battalion to join the 9th Regiment near Sombreffe; and, with the latter, to take up a position at the junction of the cross road from Ligny with that from Brye to Sombreffe. This position, which was <b>in</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> the hollow road, was maintained until past midnight.|$|E
25|$|The Brigade was reformed, {{under the}} {{protection}} of the 2nd Prussian Regiment, which now advanced from the reserve, boldly encountered the French, and aided by the effective fire of the Foot Battery No. 10, stemmed the further progress of the French, and thus gained time for the remaining Battalions to reform <b>in</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> Wagnelée. Upon the advance, however, of a French column towards its left flank, it fell back as far as the entrance into the village.|$|E

25|$|The III Prussian Corps (Thielemann's), {{which left}} Namur at about 07:00, had reached Sombreffe before 12:00. It was {{immediately}} assigned {{its position in}} that part of the field which lay between Sombreffe and Balâtre, and was posted in columns upon both high roads, here to remain available for either a movement to the right, or for the occupation of the position in left front of Sombreffe, along the heights <b>in</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> the Ligny.|$|E
25|$|Major General Grolman, the Quartermaster General of the Prussian Army, foreseeing the {{consequences}} of the line having been thus broken by the French, hastened to Brye, and requested General Pirch II to cover the retreat by means of the troops here collected together. He then proceeded in the direction of Sombreffe, and finding near this place two battalions of the 9th Regiment (6th Brigade) he posted them <b>in</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> a hollow road, leading from Brye towards Sombreffe.|$|E
25|$|The {{defect in}} the Prussian {{position}} this respect was subsequently made strikingly manifest {{by the fact that}} the gradual weakening of the Prussian centre for the purpose of reinforcing the right, was closely observed by Napoleon, who took advantage of the insight thus obtained into his opponent's designs, by collecting <b>in</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> the heights of Ligny that force with which, when he saw that the Prussians had no reserve remaining, he so suddenly assailed and broke the centre of their line.|$|E

25|$|Blücher {{had only}} one brigade {{remaining}} of the cavalry of his corps, namely that of Colonel Count Lottum; the other Brigade, under Colonel Makwitz, having been (as already explained), for some time detached to the extreme right of the Prussian Army. General Hobe, who commanded III Cavalry Division, had previously moved forward Count Lottum's Brigade and posted it <b>in</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> the 10th Infantry Brigade (Colonel Kampfen's). Thielemann now desired him to advance with Lottum's Brigade and the Horse Battery No. 19, along the Fleurus high road.|$|E
25|$|General Steinmbtz, whose Brigade {{was posted}} <b>in</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> Saint-Amand, pushed forward all the Sharpshooters of the 12th and 24th Begiments to their support.These, however, {{being unable to}} make head against the French, who already made a {{disposition}} to debouch from the village, the 12th and 24th Regiments were led forward to renew the contest. In the mean time, just as the French appeared at the outlet of the village, a shower of grape and canister was poured right down amongst them from the Foot Battery No. 7.|$|E
25|$|These two battalions, thus posted, {{caught the}} eye of Blücher as he looked round for the nearest {{available}} force, and he immediately ordered them to advance, and join in the contest; and General Brause, on being made acquainted with this disposition, led forward the 3rd Battalions of the 14th and 22nd Regiments, and the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Elbe Landwehr, while the four remaining battalions of his brigade, making a change of front to their left, formed up, in reserve, <b>in</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> the Namur road.

25|$|While {{the battle}} for the village of Ligny continued, on the right, the 5th Brigade (Tippelskirch's) was ordered to renew the attack upon Saint-Amand-la-Haye; and, as an {{auxiliary}} movement, a bold push was to be made upon the group of houses <b>in</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> that village, and of Wagnelée, called the Hameau de Saint-Amand. Both of the 3rd Battalions of the 2nd and 25th Regiments, under Major Wftzleben, advanced against the latter point, while the 1st and 2nd battalions of the 2nd Regiment, the 3rd Battalion of the 5th Westphalian Landwehr, and a battalion of the 25th Regiment made a direct attack upon Saint-Amand-la-Haye.|$|E
25|$|Thielmann {{intended}} {{that the}} 9th Brigade should be posted <b>in</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> this general disposition of his troops, {{so that its}} services might be made available according as circumstances might require; but through some misunderstanding in the transmission of the order, General Borcke was induced, after having moved along the Brussels road until near La Bawette, thence to turn off to his left, and continue his march, according to his original instructions {{in the direction of}} Fromont, Bourgeois, and Saint-Lambert, towards Couture-Saint-Germain; being under the impression that the whole corps had already commenced this march, in pursuance of the general plan, and that his brigade was destined to cover the movement.|$|E
25|$|As soon as Lieutenant General Röder {{perceived}} the imposing array of the French columns in full advance, {{he ordered the}} immediate retreat of his cavalry, which he covered with the 6th Uhlans and the Brandenburg Dragoons, together with two pieces of horse artillery. He sent the main body, which he had stationed in a hollow, <b>in</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> the Tombe-de-Ligny, as also {{the remainder of the}} artillery, across the Ligny, with directions to take post between the village of that name and Sombreffe. He himself continued with the above two regiments, and the two guns, near the Tombe-de-Ligny, until he received orders also to retire.|$|E

25|$|The 2nd Brigade (General Pirch II's) {{had been}} posted by Blücher <b>in</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> Saint-Amand-la-Haye, preparatory to a renewed attack, was upon {{the point of}} {{proceeding}} to support the 7th and 8th Brigades, then heavily engaged, when Pirch II observed the retreat towards Brye. He immediately withdrew his brigade to this point, where he supported and facilitated the retreat of the troops from the village, {{with the assistance of}} the twelve pounder Battery No. 6, and the Foot Battery No. 34, as also of the Westphalian Landwehr Cavalry (Major Wulffen's), to which latter corps several dragoons that had become separated from their own Regiments, attached themselves.|$|E
25|$|Blücher now {{decided on}} a renewed attack upon Saint-Amand-la-Haye, in order to occupy the front of Girard's Division, while he should carry into effect his {{previously}} projected movement against the French left flank; and,anxious to ensure the due execution of his instructions and to direct the attacks himself, he repaired in person {{to this part of}} the field. 5th Brigade (Tippelskirch's), having advanced along the Roman road, was already formed in brigade order, <b>in</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> Wagnelée, while Jürgass had posted his cavalry more to the left, and opposite to the interval between that village and Saint-Amand-la-Haye, where he could with considerable advantage fall upon the French, should the latter venture to debouch in that direction.|$|E
25|$|While the Prussian Infantry <b>in</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> Ligny were in {{movement}} {{for the purpose}} of relieving their comrades who were already giving way before this renewed attack, they suddenly perceived, on the French right of Ligny, a column issuing from under the heavy smoke that rolled away from the well served batteries which had so unexpectedly opened upon them, and, which continued so fearfully to thin their ranks; and, as the mass rapidly advanced down the slope with the evident design of forcing a passage across the valley, they could not fail to distinguish both by its well sustained order and compactness, and by its dark waving surface of bearskins, that they had now to contend against the redoubted Imperial Guard.|$|E
