Richard Tisei of Wakefield, Massachusetts, {{the leader of the}} Republican minority in the state Senate, called Brown [...] "the acknowledged expert on veterans' issues." [...] State Senator Jack Hart, a Democrat of South Boston, said: [...] "He does his homework, he's comprehensive in his approach, and on veterans' issues, he's one of them and has <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good job on their behalf." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to DDoS attacks against Church of Scientology websites, Anonymous also organized a campaign {{on one of}} their websites to [...] "begin bumping Digg", referring to an attempt to drive up Scientology-related links on the website Digg.com. On January 25, 2008, eight of the top ten stories on Digg.com were about either Scientology-related controversies or Anonymous and attempts to expose Scientology. Digg CEO Jay Adelson told PC World that Anonymous had not manipulated the site's algorithm system to prevent artificial poll results, stating: [...] "They must have <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good job of bringing in a diverse set of interests ... It just happened to hit a nerve that the Digg community was interested in." [...] Adelson said two other instances which similarly have dominated the Digg main page in the past were the Virginia Tech Massacre {{in the aftermath of the}} incident and the [...] "7/7" [...] London bombings in 2005. Adelson commented on the popularity of Scientology theme within the Digg community: [...] "In the history of Digg, there's no question that the topic of Scientology has been of great interest to the community ... I can't explain why." ...|$|E

On March 31, 2008 he congratulated Fox News {{on what he}} {{considered to be the}} best campaign coverage. Addressing Fox & Friends host Steve Doocy, Rendell said, [...] "I think during this entire primary coverage, starting in Iowa and up to the present, Fox has done the fairest job, has remained the most objective of all the cable networks ...

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Alexandra Fenwick of the Columbia Journalism Review on September 18, 2009, journalist Mark Bowden of The Atlantic said about the case:The young woman and filmmaker who visited those ACORN offices were political activists, and they put together what is, in essence, a very effective political protest against an organization {{they would like to}} damage. And they've <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> effective job of doing that. But I think they're clearly not journalists.The next spring, on March 20, 2010, Clark Hoyt, public editor of The New York Times, wrote an op-ed column conceding some errors in the paper's reporting. ACORN and its supporters had complained [...] "that The Times got the story wrong and, by failing to correct it, has played into the hands of a campaign that has pushed the group near extinction." [...] Hoyt acknowledged that it was by then known that it was not likely that O'Keefe went into the ACORN offices dressed as a pimp, as {{at the beginning and end}} of most of the videos. O'Keefe had presented himself [...] "as a clean-cut young man, sometimes a college student, trying to rescue his girlfriend and under-age girls from an abusive pimp." [...] But, Hoyt wrote:ACORN's supporters appear to hope that the whole story will fall apart over the issue of what O'Keefe wore: if that was wrong, everything else must be wrong. The record does not support them. If O'Keefe did not dress as a pimp, he clearly presented himself as one: a fellow trying to set up a woman — sometimes along with under-age girls — in a house where they would work as prostitutes.His article appeared before the release on April 1, 2010, of the California AG Report, which found that O'Keefe's videos had all been heavily edited to misrepresent the ACORN workers and present them in the worst possible light. The pair had set up the workers rather than doing investigative journalism. Investigations by the California AG, Brooklyn U.S. Attorney and the U.S. GAO found that ACORN workers had not participated in criminal activities.|$|E
