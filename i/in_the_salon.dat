5|$|By {{the time}} he painted September Morn, Paul Émile Chabas (1869–1937) already had an {{established}} reputation as an academic artist. He regularly submitted to the Paris Salon, first participating in 1886. He won a third class medal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Salon</b> of 1895, and four years later won the Prix National for his painting Joyeux ébats, which earned him a {{gold medal at the}} 1900 Exposition Universelle and was acquired by the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nantes.

In 1902 he was made a Chevalier in the Legion of Honour.|$|E
5|$|Lewis and Audrey {{decide to}} go on holiday {{together}} and Lewis offers to pay for himself. Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly wrote that Lewis' renewed relationship with Audrey and their plans {{to go on a}} round-the-world cruise would cause a feud between her and David. Audrey's money is tied up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>salon,</b> so she asks David to sign it back to her so she can pay for the holiday. However, David refuses to sign the salon back as he thinks Lewis might be planning another fraud. Kilkelly said Lewis tries to play peacemaker and suggests postponing the trip until he can save the money himself, but Audrey insists David will co-operate and she tears up their contract.|$|E

25|$|Degas painted Interior at a {{time when}} his growing {{commitment}} to Realism had led him away from his earlier preoccupation with historical subjects such as Sémiramis Building Babylon (1860–62), Young Spartans Exercising (ca.1860), and the painting which marked his Salon debut, Scene of War in the Middle Ages (1865). His new direction was apparent by the time he exhibited Steeplechase—The Fallen Jockey <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Salon</b> of 1866. Degas probably intended to submit Interior for exhibition <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Salon</b> of 1869, but it was not shown publicly until June 1905, when it was displayed at Galerie Durand-Ruel in Paris.|$|E

50|$|He {{was born}} in Grenoble. He {{received}} a Jesuit education at Lyon and joined the staff of Marshal François de Franquetot de Coigny, rising to become the Marshal's chief secretary and serving him in this capacity for a decade. On his return he was {{taken up by the}} young Mlle Poisson, not yet marquise de Pompadour. His libretto for Jean-Philippe Rameau's Castor et Pollux (1737), a resounding success, rendered him fashionable <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>salons.</b> He translated Ovid's Ars amatoria (L'Art de l'Amour) but never intended to publish it, or much else of his fugitive verses. The publisher Leroux noted it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>salons</b> where Bernard often declaimed it, and printed it. Bernard was also known for his Epistle to Claudine.|$|R
50|$|In 1860, {{he opened}} a mobile pupazzi theatre staging celebrities of the moment as caricatures. It was a great success <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>salons</b> of <b>the</b> late nineteenth.

25|$|Seventy-one {{percent of}} Paris residences had three rooms or less, usually a salon, a bedroom and a kitchen, the salon also {{serving as a}} dining room.

25|$|In {{his last}} years Manet painted many {{small-scale}} still lifes {{of fruits and}} vegetables, such as Bunch of Asparagus and The Lemon (both 1880). He completed his last major work, A Bar at the Folies-Bergère (Un Bar aux Folies-Bergère), in 1882 and it hung <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Salon</b> that year. Afterwards he limited himself to small formats. His last paintings were of flowers in glass vases.|$|E
25|$|After {{painting}} {{a series of}} pictures, {{some of which are}} still in existence today, I was still dissatisfied and yet better prepared for experiments that would go deeper. It was in 1910 that, for the first time, I showed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Salon</b> des Indépendants and completely abandoned the salon of the Nationale, where there was nothing more for me to do. I sent to the Cours-la-Reine a full figure, a full sized portrait of the poet René Arcos, as well as two landscapes of the area round Paris, simple collections of masses in restrained colours. From that moment onwards, I can see it clearly now, my researches passed from the surface to the interior of the plastic problem. So 1910 brought another white stone to my life, as it would mark a stage which, if it was not conclusive, would at least be very positive. Above all {{in the second half of}} that year, when I painted the canvasses which would appear <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Salon</b> des Indépendants of 1911.|$|E
