5|$|The {{treatment}} for <b>ectropion</b> {{varies depending on}} {{the severity of the}} condition. The only {{treatment for}} entropion is surgical, and may be delayed until the dog reaches adulthood as whilst a puppy the facial structures of the animal are still growing and changing. Dogs who have surgical correction for defects such as entropion or <b>ectropion</b> may not be exhibited in the show ring.|$|E
5|$|Cervical polyps, {{which are}} benign {{overgrowth}}s of endocervical tissue, if present, may cause bleeding, or a benign overgrowth {{may be present}} in the cervical canal. Cervical <b>ectropion</b> refers to the horizontal overgrowth of the endocervical columnar lining in a one-cell-thick layer over the ectocervix.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ectropion</b> is {{the outward}} rolling of the eyelid, which {{abnormally}} exposes the eye, resulting in irritation. Because {{of the increased}} exposure, the dog can develop allergic or bacterial conjunctivitis or keratoconjunctivitis sicca also known as dry-eye syndrome. It is most commonly found in breeds with exaggerated facial features such as the Boxer, Bloodhound, Gordon Setter {{as well as the}} English and American Cocker Spaniels, and the English Springer Spaniel.|$|E
50|$|Usually no {{treatment}} is indicated for clinically asymptomatic cervical <b>ectropions.</b> Hormonal therapy may be indicated for symptomatic erosion. If it becomes troublesome to the patient, {{it can be}} treated by discontinuing oral contraceptives, cryotherapy treatment, or by using ablation treatment under local anaesthetic. Ablation involves using a preheated probe (100 °C) to destroy 3 - 4 mm of the epithelium. In post-partum erosion, observation and re-examination are necessary for 3 months after labour.|$|R
40|$|AIMS—To {{describe}} the ophthalmic findings {{in a large}} cohort of epidermolysis bullosa (EB) patients managed in one large specialist centre.  METHODS—A case note review of consecutive patients seen at Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital. Data on the dermatological disease, ophthalmic history, and examination were collected and coded onto a data sheet.  RESULTS— 181 patients: 50  (28 %) simplex EB; 15  (8 %) junctional EB; 28  (15 %) autosomal dominant dystrophic EB; 72  (40 %) autosomal recessive dystrophic EB; nine patients (5 %) with dystrophic EB whose inheritance could not be ascertained; and seven cases (4 %) of EB {{that could not be}} classified. Ocular problems were found in 12 % (n= 6) of simplex patients and 40 % (n= 6) of those with junctional disease. One patient (of 28) in the autosomal dominant dystrophic group had ocular involvement and 51 % (37 / 72) of patients in the autosomal recessive dystrophic group had ophthalmic complications: corneal (25 / 72), lid <b>ectropions</b> (3 / 72), lid blisters (5 / 72), and symblepharon (3 / 72).  CONCLUSION—Ophthalmic complications are common in EB overall but the incidence varies widely with subtype. Ophthalmic complications are the most severe in the dystrophic recessive and junctional subtypes where {{there is a need for}} extra vigilance. The major treatment modality was use of ocular lubricants.    Keywords: epidermolysis bullos...|$|R
25|$|<b>Ectropion</b> (eyelid folding outward) is {{a common}} {{condition}} in dogs, usually affecting the lower lid. Breeds associated with <b>ectropion</b> include the Cocker Spaniel, the St. Bernard, the Bloodhound, and the Basset Hound.|$|E

25|$|Conjunctivitis* is {{inflammation}} of the conjunctiva. In dogs it is most commonly caused by mechanical irritation (such as by entropion, <b>ectropion,</b> or trichiasis), allergies, and keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Any bacterial infection is usually secondary.|$|E
25|$|The {{very fast}} growth {{rate and the}} weight of a St. Bernard can lead to very serious {{deterioration}} of the bones if the dog does not get proper food and exercise. Many dogs are genetically affected by hip dysplasia or elbow dysplasia. Osteosarcoma (bone cancer) {{has been shown to be}} hereditary in the breed. They are susceptible to eye disorders called entropion and <b>ectropion,</b> in which the eyelid turns in or out. The breed standard indicates that this is a major fault. The breed is also susceptible to epilepsy and seizures, a heart disease called dilated cardiomyopathy, and eczema.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ectropion</b> is {{a medical}} {{condition}} in which the lower eyelid turns outwards. It {{is one of the}} notable aspects of newborns exhibiting congenital Harlequin-type ichthyosis, but <b>ectropion</b> can occur due to any weakening of tissue of the lower eyelid. The condition can be repaired surgically. <b>Ectropion</b> is also found in dogs as a genetic disorder in certain breeds.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ectropion</b> in dogs usually {{involves}} the lower eyelid. Often the condition has no symptoms, but tearing and conjunctivitis may be seen. Breeds associated with <b>ectropion</b> include the Cocker Spaniel, the Saint Bernard, the Bloodhound, the Clumber Spaniel, and the Basset Hound. It can also result from trauma or nerve damage. Treatment (surgery) is recommended {{only if there}} is chronic conjunctivitis or if there is corneal damage. A {{small part of the}} affected lid is removed and then the lid is sewn back together.|$|E
50|$|The baby {{is often}} {{born in a}} {{collodion}} membrane, a shiny, wax outer layer on the skin and usually with <b>ectropion,</b> having the lower eyelid turned outwards. When the membrane is shed the skin is red with a generalized white scale. Palms, soles and areas on the joints are often affected with hyperkeratosis, a thickening of the layer of dead skin cells {{on the surface of}} the skin. In classical CIE (unlike LI) there is little eclabion (eversion of the lips), <b>ectropion</b> and alopecia (hair loss).|$|E

50|$|Another study, “Combined Transconjunctival Release and Midface-lift for Postblepharoplasty <b>Ectropion</b> Repair”, was co-authored by Dr. Benjamin Stong and {{appeared}} in the May/June 2010 issue of Archives of Facial Plastic Surgery.|$|E
50|$|He was {{the author}} of {{numerous}} articles on ophthalmic medicine, published in Carl Wilhelm von Zehender's Klinische Monatsblatt für Augenheilkunde. He is credited with performing the first Z-plasty for correction of <b>ectropion.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Ectropion</b> {{is another}} aging-related eyelid {{condition}} {{that may lead}} to chronic eye irritation and scarring. It may also be the result of allergies and its main symptoms are pain, excessive tearing and hardening of the eyelid conjunctiva.|$|E

5000|$|The first Z-plasty was {{performed}} by Horner in 1837, followed by Denonvilliers in 1854, both for correction of <b>ectropion.</b> [...] The first standard double transposition Z-plasty was reported by Berger in 1904, and McCurdy introduced the term in 1913.|$|E
50|$|Any {{deviation}} from the foregoing points {{should be considered a}} failure, with the severity of this proportional to the degree of {{deviation from}} the standard. The most common may be the presence of <b>ectropion</b> and entropion, topline saddle, pointed snout, level bite, etc.|$|E
50|$|The {{appearance}} {{is often described}} as a shiny film looking like a layer of vaseline. The eyelids and mouth may have the appearance of being forced open due to the tightness of the skin. There can be associated eversion of the eyelids (<b>ectropion).</b>|$|E
50|$|Cervical <b>ectropion</b> can be {{associated}} with excessive but non-purulent vaginal discharge due to the increased surface area of columnar epithelium containing mucus-secreting glands. It may also give rise to post-coital bleeding, as fine blood vessels present within the columnar epithelium are easily traumatised.|$|E
50|$|Walther is {{best known}} for his pioneer work in {{ophthalmology}} and ophthalmic surgery. In 1826 he described the first tarsorrhaphy for closure of a portion of the eyelids for partial <b>ectropion.</b> In the treatise Ueber die Hornhautflecken, he gave an early account of corneal opacity.|$|E
50|$|Cervical polyps, {{which are}} benign {{overgrowth}}s of endocervical tissue, if present, may cause bleeding, or a benign overgrowth {{may be present}} in the cervical canal.

50|$|Eurasiers are {{generally}} healthy dogs, though a small gene {{pool in the}} breed's early years has led to some hereditary diseases being seen occasionally. Known issues include hip dysplasia, luxating patella, and hypothyroidism, as well as eyelid and lash disorders such as distichiae, entropion, and <b>ectropion.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Cervical <b>ectropion</b> is {{a normal}} phenomenon, {{especially}} in the ovulatory phase in younger women, during pregnancy, and in women taking the oral contraceptive pill, which increases the total estrogen level in the body. It also may be a congenital problem by persistence of the squamocolumnar junction which is normally present prior to birth.|$|E
