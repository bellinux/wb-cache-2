This study investigates the impact of <b>governing</b> <b>bodies</b> on schools in the Northern Province: Region Three. In doing so, the study examines the role played by the Provincial Education Department, headmasters, teachers and learners in the {{establishment of}} democratic <b>governing</b> <b>bodies.</b> It covers six schools from six areas of Region Three in the Northern Province. Through interviewing officials of the Department of Education who are actively involved with school governance, the headmasters of each school visited, parents, teachers and learners, their views and perceptions were examined regarding the role of <b>governing</b> <b>bodies</b> in schools. The researcher also made use of observation to gather information on the work of <b>governing</b> <b>bodies</b> in schools. School environments and the state of buildings were observed as a measure to determine dedication and commitment of the headmasters, staff and members of the <b>governing</b> <b>bodies.</b> Despite all the democratic processes followed in the implementation of school <b>governing</b> <b>bodies,</b> and the new powers and functions that have been given to them, <b>governing</b> <b>bodies</b> have not successfully democratised schools. Neither have <b>governing</b> <b>bodies</b> improved the culture of learning and teaching; contributed to the provision of quality education and curriculum development; helped in the maintenance of discipline, or raised funds for the schools. This study has revealed that factors such as educational resources, time,different interest groups, lack of active participation, differing value systems in the sub-culture and different age groups impact [...] the activities of <b>governing</b> <b>bodies.</b> The results of the study suggest that there is the need for programmes to train members of the <b>governing</b> <b>bodies</b> into the new ethos, including sacrificing their time; being committed and becoming actively involved in the activities of <b>governing</b> <b>bodies</b> and schools...|$|R

40|$|M. Ed.) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2003 The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the possible training needs of the school <b>governing</b> <b>bodies</b> so that they can play their roles efficiently. Education can no longer be led by the producers, namely the academic theorists, the administrators and the educators' unions. Education must be shaped by the users, by what is good for the individual child and what hopes are held by parents. If power is to be moved, then it has to be managed, by implication, this management is to be by the users represented by the governors. <b>Governing</b> <b>bodies</b> have to take ownership of their schools to make sure that quality education is provided. In order to be effective democratically and managerially, the need for training should be recognized. The responsibilities for <b>governing</b> <b>bodies</b> are so important and complex that a governor cannot be expected to discharge them effectively without some training going beyond the normal process of picking up the job by doing it. The empirical investigation was employed to determine the training needs and strategies of the school <b>governing</b> <b>bodies.</b> Literature survey was also employed to determine the possible problems preventing the <b>governing</b> <b>bodies</b> to manage effectively. The population involved in this study was confined to principals, educator governors, parents, learners and co-opted members. The results of 210 respondents were analyzed. The findings revealed that the <b>governing</b> <b>bodies</b> did not know what to do and what not to do (i. e. they do not know their job description). Findings more over revealed that the <b>governing</b> <b>bodies</b> need to be empowered through extensive training. Recommendations made by the respondents on how training of school <b>governing</b> <b>bodies</b> should be done are also expounded. The respondents put more effort on organisation of workshops, mentoring, in-service training, clinical supervision and induction as relevant strategies that can enhance efficient school governance.
