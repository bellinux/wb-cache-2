5|$|In myth, {{the gods}} behave much like humans. They feel emotion; they can eat, drink, fight, weep, sicken, and die. Some have unique {{character}} traits. Set is aggressive and impulsive, and Thoth, patron {{of writing and}} <b>knowledge,</b> <b>is</b> prone to long-winded speeches. Yet overall, the gods are more like archetypes than well drawn characters. Their behavior is inconsistent, and their thoughts and motivations are rarely stated. Most myths about them lack highly developed characters and plots, because the symbolic meaning of the myths {{was more important than}} elaborate storytelling.|$|E

5|$|Other {{volcanic}} techniques, such as hazard mapping, {{displays a}} volcano's eruptive history in detail and speculates {{an understanding of}} the hazardous activity that could possibly be expected in the future. At present no hazard maps have been created for the Silverthrone Caldera because the level of <b>knowledge</b> <b>is</b> insufficient due to its remoteness. A large volcanic hazard program has never existed within the Geological Survey of Canada. The majority of information has been collected in a lengthy, separate way from the support of several employees, such as volcanologists and other geologic scientists. Current <b>knowledge</b> <b>is</b> best established at Mount Meager and is likely to rise considerably with a temporary mapping and monitoring project. Knowledge at the Silverthrone Caldera and other volcanoes in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt is not as established, but certain contributions are being done at least Mount Cayley. An intensive program classifiying infrastructural exposure near all young Canadian volcanoes and quick hazard assessments at each individual volcanic edifice associated with recent seismic activity would be in advance and would produce a quick and productive determination of priority areas for further efforts.|$|E
5|$|Past {{experiences}} {{or general}} <b>knowledge</b> <b>is</b> {{often called upon}} in conversation, {{so it is a}} useful context for children to learn words. Recalling past experiences allows the child to call upon their own visual, tactical, oral, and/or auditory references. For example, if a child once went to a zoo and saw an elephant, but did not know the word elephant, an adult could later help the child recall this event, describing the size and color of the animal, how big its ears were, its trunk, and the sound it made, then using the word elephant to refer to the animal. Calling upon prior <b>knowledge</b> <b>is</b> used not only in conversation, but often in book reading as well to help explain what is happening in a story by relating it back to the child's own experiences.|$|E
40|$|Background : With {{respect to}} the {{importance}} of prevention on disease process and also bear in mind the fact of leshmaniasis as an endemic disease in Kashan, teachers education could play an utmost role in the process of disease control. Thus their knowledge towards the leshmaniasis should be considered. Materials and Methods : It was a quasi experimental study. 1300 teachers had entered the pretest, among whom, 776 have continued their cooperation and took part in post test. Their <b>knowledge</b> <b>was</b> evaluated using 16 criteria. Their <b>knowledge</b> <b>was</b> reevaluated one month late r following they have received a training pamphlet. Data analysis was performed using Mc Nemar test. Meanwhile, the association between age, sex, marital status, level of education, etc with <b>knowledge</b> <b>was</b> evaluated. Results : Of 776 teachers, 462 were primary school and 314 were guidance school teachers. The level of <b>knowledge</b> <b>was</b> increased from 77. 8 to 86. 9. This increment was statistically significant on all criteria. The least <b>knowledge</b> <b>was</b> towards the etiology of leshmaniasis (30. 2), however, following the training material this <b>knowledge</b> <b>was</b> improved to 61. 9. Conclusion : Training materials can be helpful to promote teachers <b>knowledge.</b> Similar activities <b>are</b> highly recommended...|$|R

5|$|There is a {{distinction}} between when a player is in character, meaning they are actively representing their character, and when the player is out-of-character, meaning they are being themselves.

In a LARP, it is usually assumed that players are speaking and acting in character unless otherwise noted, which {{is the opposite of}} normal practice in tabletop role-playing games. Character <b>knowledge</b> <b>is</b> usually considered to be separate from player knowledge, and acting upon information a character would not know may be viewed as cheating.|$|E

Articulatory-phonetic skill was evaluated using maximum repetition tasks and by assessing stimulability for /s/. Phonological <b>knowledge</b> <b>was</b> assessed by examining the acoustic cues used by children to distinguish their productions of /s/ and /theta/. Acoustic-phonetic knowledge and phonological <b>knowledge</b> <b>were</b> each found to explain a small but significant amount of the variance in articulation accuracy.
