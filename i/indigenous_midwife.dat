40|$|Throughout the Third World, {{a notable}} trend {{has been the}} {{proliferation}} of parallel health care systems in which cosmopolitan medical services co-exist {{with a variety of}} indigenous health care services, and client populations must make decisions regarding the preferred choice among the existing alternatives. Correspondingly, Bariba women in People's Republic of Benin, West Africa, who seek obstetrical care have an increasing number of available options from which to select, including government hospitals, maternity clinics, private clinics, and a variety of indigenous practitioners. An examination of the factors influencing choices of birth assistance among Bariba women suggests that attributes of indigenous midwives such as status characteristics and type of training serve as significant considerations for clientele selecting obstetrical care. Characteristics discussed as salient features of the midwife include religion, age, marital status, education, apprenticeship, and certain personal qualities such as courage and lack of modesty. In addition, features of the midwifery role are delineated; for instance, the role of <b>indigenous</b> <b>midwife</b> involves a great deal of variability in contrast to that of the government nurse-midwife, which appears as a more narrow specialization. In order to fulfill role expectations, the <b>indigenous</b> <b>midwife</b> must demonstrate attributes which fall within an acceptable range to the client population, thus rendering her reasonably homophilous. Homophily is defined as 'the degree to which pairs of individuals who interact are similar in certain attributes such as beliefs, values, education, social status'. The data suggest that a healer, in this instance an <b>indigenous</b> <b>midwife,</b> is selected in order to accomplish a particular task. A client assumes certain characteristics of the role occupant are requisite for the healer to be effective and competent. Clients and midwives are found to be homophilous in that they share concepts of causation, beliefs, values and role expectations. Where the healer is not homophilous with the client, the absence of homophily operates to deter prospective clients from utilizing obstetrical services. Thus {{in the case of the}} rural client/government midwife relationship, the respective role occupants are shown not to be homophilous. In contrast to the <b>indigenous</b> <b>midwife,</b> the government midwife does not share significant attributes, values and expectations with her client and this lack of homophily deters prospective clients from selecting the government midwife as an option for birth assistance. ...|$|E

40|$|International reports {{highlight}} that {{improvements to}} health outcomes for Indigenous populations {{is linked to}} greater participation by Indigenous people {{in the provision of}} health service delivery. Australian government policies underline the need {{to increase the number of}} practising <b>Indigenous</b> <b>midwives</b> as a strategy for delivering culturally appropriate healthcare that will help improve health outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families. One of the key components of the 'Close the Gap' initiative includes enabling Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to enter the healthcare workforce. <b>Indigenous</b> <b>midwives</b> and nurses' lived experiences, along with their knowledge of health service delivery, provides them with unique insight of the health system. It is recognised that it is essential to increase the numbers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with tertiary level qualifications in order to provide culturally appropriate healthcare that will ultimately lead to increased uptake and subsequent health improvements. In this presentation, we share the stories told to us as part of a small, qualitative study that explored the experiences of a sample of Indigenous Australian women and <b>Indigenous</b> student <b>midwives</b> who participated in a 'follow through' journey as part of a Bachelor of Midwifery program in northern Australia. The findings of our study highlight the urgent need for improved strategies and policies that recruit and retain Indigenous midwifery students as their contribution is key to improving health outcomes for Indigenous childbearing women and their families...|$|R

40|$|The {{health care}} system in Mexico was built upon a western model in which {{curative}} rather than preventive medicine is emphasized. However, the incorporation of <b>indigenous</b> <b>midwives</b> into maternal and child care and family planning programs by several public health agencies is an exception to the governmental health policies. An analysis of midwife preferences among rural women indicates that primarily poor illiterate women with children, living in remote areas with difficult access, rely on midwives. The continued reliance on midwives by this sector of the population makes the government programs most important. These programs are a unique case in which the incorporation of traditional practitioners in the modern health system has occurred. However, in order to implement programs that have the capability to offer rural women the benefits of both health systems, the incorporation of the traditional midwives requires not only the upgrading of their skills in modern antiseptic techniques, but the recognition of the contributions of traditional health practices, and the research of elements and practices to foster its understanding. traditional midwife rural health maternal and child care indigenous medicine...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{explore how}} Cakchiquel {{midwives}} {{were involved in}} the Mayan cultural-political shift perpetuating traditional beliefs and practices while adapting to the new expectations of midwifery and care of parturient women. Design: A qualitative study based on in-depth interviews. Setting: Three municipalities, Tecpán, Patzicia and Patzún, located in the departemento of Chimaltenango in the highlands of Guatemala. Participants: Cakchiquel midwives from Tecpán, Patzicia and Patzún (n = 11). Measurement of findings: The study analysis involved a coding framework to identify all key themes and categories. The analytical and interpretive process involved understanding midwives ‟ practices and beliefs within each transcript/interview. Key conclusions and implications for practice: The main themes that emerged from the interviews with the Cakchiquel midwives from Tecpán, Patzicia and Patzún were the noted differences between past and present obstetrical practices and beliefs, such as the different „callings ‟ that midwives experience to practice midwifery, the persistent socio-economic disadvantages confronted by <b>indigenous</b> <b>midwives,</b> the legalization of midwifery as a profession, and the inception and support of a referral system. The respondents have been active in a social movement of post-materialism and newly created identities generating an intercultural healthcare alternative for indigenous wome...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{workforce}} data, as {{an estimate}} of the current capability of the midwifery workforce to provide midwifery care, is confounded by systematic reporting issues that may overestimate the potential of the existing midwifery workforce. This paper reports the characteristics of qualified Australian midwives who responded to the baseline data collection in the Midwives and Nurses e-Cohort Study and compares those who are currently practising in midwifery with those who are not. Currently practising midwives represented only 52 % of those respondents who identified as midwives and the profile of the typical midwife is female, aged over 40 years, Australian, married or in a de facto relationship. She has been registered for over 10 years, educated to postgraduate diploma level and currently works in a clinical midwifery role in a hospital for less than 35 hours per week. Specific deficits in the Australian midwifery workforce namely low numbers of <b>indigenous</b> <b>midwives,</b> independent practitioners and midwives suitably qualified to teach and undertake research in academia are identified. Drawing on the nationally representative e-cohort data, this cross-sectional analysis identifies {{for the first time the}} real face of the Australian midwifery workforce and provides an evidence-based foundation for future workforce planning and a methodology for other countries interested in accurately monitoring their actual and potential midwifery workforce...|$|R
40|$|Background: Evidence is {{emerging}} {{of the benefits}} to students of providing continuity of midwifery care as a learning strategy in midwifery education, however {{little is known about}} the value of this strategy for midwifery students. Aim: To explore Indigenous students' perceptions of providing continuity of midwifery care to Indigenous women whilst undertaking a Bachelor of Midwifery. Methods: Indigenous Bachelor of Midwifery students' experiences of providing continuity of midwifery care to Indigenous childbearing women were explored within an Indigenous research approach using a narrative inquiry framework. Participants were three Indigenous midwifery students who provided continuity of care to Indigenous women. Findings: Three interconnected themes; facilitating connection, being connected, and journeying with the woman. These themes contribute to the overarching finding that the experience of providing continuity of care for Indigenous women creates a sense of personal affirmation, purpose and a validation of cultural identity in Indigenous students. Discussion and Conclusions: Midwifery philosophy aligns strongly with the Indigenous health philosophy and this provides a learning platform for <b>Indigenous</b> student <b>midwives.</b> Privileging <b>Indigenous</b> culture within midwifery education programs assists students develop a sense of purpose and affirms them in their emerging professional role and within their community. The findings from this study illustrate the demand for, and pertinence of, continuity of care midwifery experiences with Indigenous women as fundamental to increasing the Indigenous midwifery workforce in Australia.

40|$|The well {{established}} disparities in health outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians include {{a significant and}} concerning higher incidence of preterm birth, low birth weight and newborn mortality. Chronic diseases (eg, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular and renal disease) that are prevalent in Indigenous Australian adults have their genesis in utero and in early life. Applying interventions during pregnancy and early life that aim to improve maternal and infant health {{is likely to have}} long lasting consequences, as recognised by Australia’s National Maternity Services Plan (NMSP), which set out a 5 -year vision for 2010 - 2015 that was endorsed by all governments (federal and state and territory). We report on the actions targeting Indigenous women, and the progress that has been achieved in three priority areas: The Indigenous maternity workforce; Culturally competent maternity care; and; Developing dedicated programs for “Birthing on Country”. The timeframe for the NMSP has expired without notable results in these priority areas. More urgent leadership is required from the Australian government. Funding needs to be allocated to the priority areas, including for scholarships and support to train and retain <b>Indigenous</b> <b>midwives,</b> greater commitment to culturally competent maternity care and the development and evaluation of Birthing on Country sites in urban, rural and particularly in remote and very remote communities.

40|$|In recent years, Indigenous midwifery has reemerged {{as a vital}} form of {{maternity}} care in Canada. With {{the majority}} of practices being situated in rural and remote areas, Seventh Generation Midwives Toronto (SGMT) remains the only urban-based Indigenous focused midwifery practice in the country. Looking to develop a culturally relevant performance measurement system for the practice, SGMT partnered with the Well Living House (WLH) ? an Indigenous action research centre in Toronto ? to undertake a community-based, participatory, realist, and utilization-focused evaluation study. This thesis project was nested {{in one of the}} qualitative branches of this evaluation. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine former clients of SGMT who self-identified as Indigenous to determine (1) how Indigenous women conceptualize cultural safety and (2) the extent to which their experiences at SGMT aligned with these conceptualizations. The interviews were transcribed verbatim, and the transcripts were analyzed using collaborative, consensus-based, iterative, and decolonizing methods. Twelve core themes that were grouped into four thematic pillars or containers emerged from this process. Even though the women participants were unique in their backgrounds, insights, and experiences, when taken together, culturally safe Indigenous midwifery care meant (1) "culturally continuous care?, (2) being able to access both Indigenous knowledge and practice and practical reproductive health information, (3) being connected to the community, and (4) feeling ?at home? in a health care setting. There was also widespread support for SGMT as a practice; most ? although not all ? women felt that their pregnancy, birthing, and reproductive needs were fully met, and that they were made to feel culturally safe. All of the women offered constructive and loving feedback for the practice, even if they had experiences that fell short of their expectations. This confirms that SGMT can and does provide culturally safe care, and that cultural safety both has benefits and a place in the mainstream health care system. This project also sheds light on the roles and responsibilities of contemporary <b>Indigenous</b> <b>midwives</b> {{and the ways in which}} they can be supported. Altogether, herein lies a compelling argument for the continued support and expansion of urban-based Indigenous midwifery, and the application of cultural safety in a Canadian context...|$|R

40|$|Developing {{high-quality}} {{and culturally}} responsive maternal and infant health services {{is a critical}} part of ‘closing the gap’ in health disparities between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and other Australians. The National Maternity Services Plan led work that describes and recommends Birthing on Country best-practice maternity care adaptable from urban to very remote settings, yet few examples exist in Australia. This paper demonstrates Birthing on Country principles can be applied in the urban setting, presenting our experience establishing and developing a Birthing on Country partnership service model in Brisbane, Australia. An initial World Café workshop effectively engaged stakeholders, consumers and community members in service planning, resulting in a multiagency partnership program between a large inner city hospital and two local Aboriginal Community-Controlled Health Services (ACCHS). The Birthing in Our Community program includes: 24 / 7 midwifery care in pregnancy to six weeks postnatal by a named <b>midwife,</b> supported by <b>Indigenous</b> health workers and a team coordinator; partnership with the ACCHS; oversight from a steering committee, including Indigenous governance; clinical and cultural supervision; monthly cultural education days; and support for <b>Indigenous</b> student <b>midwives</b> through cadetships and placement within the partnership.

40|$|Australia {{needs more}} Indigenous nurses. This is widely {{recognised}} in both academic literature and government policy. In 2012, only 0. 8 {{percent of the}} Australian nursing workforce was Indigenous (AIHW, 2012). In spite of the clear need, there is little discussion about how to successfully recruit, retain and graduate Indigenous nursing students. This paper describes a successful program being implemented at the University of Southern Queensland (USQ). Between 2000 and 2012, USQ graduated 80 <b>Indigenous</b> nurses and <b>midwives,</b> at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. In this paper, the authors outline the journey they undertook to develop the successful program at USQ: the Indigenous Nursing Support (INS) Model: Helping Hands.

40|$|Overview] Since 2007, the 'Helping Hands' {{team from}} the Department of Nursing and Midwifery in the Faculty of Sciences at USQ, lead by Lynne Stuart, has {{developed}} and implemented a package of retention and support strategies, called 'Helping Hands for Indigenous Nursing Students'. Each team member provided cultural knowledge which the team leader, Lynne Stuart, synthesised to create an Indigenised nursing support package called 'Helping Hands'. This has now been translated into a written Indigenous nursing support model. Since it was implemented in 2007, Helping Hands, has contributed to a large growth in enrolments and graduations, with the annual graduation rate over the period 2007 - 2011 being nearly six times that for the previous 17 years. Key industry stake holders at Queensland Health advised the Head of Department, Professor Cath Rogers – Clark, that 'USQ is now {{a leader in the}} educational preparation of <b>Indigenous</b> nurses and <b>midwives</b> in Australia' USQ acknowledged these outcomes by awarding the Helping Hands team a USQ Citation in 2010 for outstanding contributions to student learning. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{contribution}} {{deals with}} the potential of indigenous knowledge for the geotourism sustainability of the aspiring Rio Coco Geopark (Nicaragua). This indigenous knowledge includes traditional, orally transmitted wisdom, skills and lifestyle of indigenous people built on their intensive linkage to nature and verified by time. The article focuses on the analysis of potential of integration of this traditional know-how passed {{from generation to generation}} and as well as other elements of collective memory into the philosophy, management and products of the emerging geotourism destination of Rio Coco Geopark. Author presumes that the integration of local indigenous knowledge into the geotourism developed by Rio Coco Geopark has potential to increase the sustainability level of this geotourism. To analyse this presumption, the local indigenous people – Chorotegas were inquired. The research of these native people was conducted in all four municipalities of Rio Coco Geopark recognized as indigenous and it employed methods of participant observation, photo-documentation, focal group discussions, life history narratives and local informants (<b>indigenous</b> leaders, healers, <b>midwifes</b> etc.) interviewing. The main potential was found in the system of values related to nature (e. g. respect for Mother Earth as a life giving entity) and related natural resources management, the systematic involvement of seniors into the top management, using cosmology and natural cycles into the local agriculture and medicine, using the traditional knowledge in processing of local crops and natural raw materials as well as keeping and transmission of many interesting indigenous legends and rites connected to the local geological heritage and other elements of local nature. Findings of the research indicate that the sensible and gradual fusion of the modern science knowledge with the traditional indigenous knowledge can essentially assist with optimization of the environmental, socio-cultural and economic tourism impacts. It could be assumed that it pays not only for the aspiring Rio Coco Geopark but also for other destinations with important geological heritage and related fragile natural and cultural heritage...|$|R
