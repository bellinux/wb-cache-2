However, {{it is not known}} to what extent patients express cues or concerns and how providers respond. In this study, we investigated cues and responses that occur in online patient-provider communication at an infertility-specific <b>expert</b> <b>forum.</b> We extracted 106 threads from the multidisciplinary <b>expert</b> <b>forum</b> of two Dutch IVF clinics. We performed the following analyses: (1) thematic analysis of patients' questions; and (2) rating patients' emotional and informational cues and subsequent professionals' responses using an adaptation of the validated Medical Interview Aural Rating Scale. Frequencies of themes, frequencies of cues and responses, and sequences (what cue is followed by what response) were extracted. Sixty-five infertile patients and 19 providers participated. The most common themes included medication and lifestyle. Patients gave more informational than emotional cues (106 versus 64). Responses to informational cues were mostly adequate (61 %). The most common response to emotional cues was empathic acknowledgment (72 %). Results indicate that an online <b>expert</b> <b>forum</b> could {{have a positive effect on}} patient outcomes, which should guide future research. Offering infertile patients an <b>expert</b> <b>forum</b> to communicate with providers can be a promising supplement to usual care in both providing information and addressing patients' concerns...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundAn <b>Expert</b> <b>Forum</b> {{was held}} at the 2014 European Respiratory Society International Congress to address issues {{involved}} in the management of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB). Multiple studies have found that chronic P.  aeruginosa infection is associated with more severe disease and higher morbidity and mortality. OverviewParticipants discussed appropriate management of P.  aeruginosa infection at three stages: 1) first isolation, including eradication protocols; 2) during exacerbations; and 3) during chronic infection, including long-term antibiotic therapy to reduce the severity of symptoms and frequency of exacerbations. Topics covered included frequency of sputum cultures, antibiotic treatment at first isolation and for exacerbations, optimal use of inhaled antibiotics, indications for long-term therapy, and treatment regimens that may reduce the frequency or severity of symptoms. Electronic polling and roundtable discussions followed by expert insights were used to address these topics. Significant diversity in management practices was reported among different countries and centres, and in many cases clinical management was at variance with published guidelines. ConclusionsThis <b>Expert</b> <b>Forum</b> identified standardised terminology, clinician training, additional research into management strategies, and the development of new drugs as areas requiring improvement for the optimal management of P.  aeruginosa in NCFB...|$|R

The institutional design of ETPs and the political priorities that ZEP’s visions and activities have become entangled with are also discussed. The article concludes that predictions about technological development allows potentially contentious societal choices to be masked as technological ones, and that increased attention to the sociotechnical dynamics of technology-driven visions, drawing on insights from FS and STS, could add necessary transparency and legitimacy to the activities of <b>expert</b> <b>forums,</b> consistent with current EC guidelines.|$|R

40|$|Background: As {{the problem}} of patient non-adherence {{persists}} and a solution appears hard to be found, {{it continues to be}} important to look for new ways to further the issue. We recently conducted a meta-review of adherence intervention studies which yielded a preliminary agenda for future research, practice and theory development in patient adherence. The objective of the present project was to find out to what extent adherence experts consider this agenda relevant and feasible. Methods: The thirty-five corresponding authors of the review studies included in the meta-review were invited to join the International <b>Expert</b> <b>Forum</b> on Patient Adherence and to participate in a four-week web-based focus group discussion. The discussion was triggered by the points on the preliminary agenda presented as propositions to which forum members could react. Two researchers analysed the transcripts and selected relevant phrases. Results: Twenty adherence experts participated. Various ideas and viewpoints were raised. After the closure of the web-site, the <b>expert</b> <b>forum</b> was asked to authorize the synthesis of the discussion, to list the propositions in order of priority and to answer a few questions {{on the use of the}} web-based focus group as a tool to obtain expert opinions. Their ranking showed that the development of simple interventions is the most promising step to take in fostering patient adherence, preferably within a multidisciplinary setting of medical, pharmaceutical, social and technical science and, not in the least, by incorporating patients' perspectives. Conclusion: For enhancing adherence, the development of simple interventions originating from a multidisciplinary perspective including patients' input, appears most promising. Disclosing patients' perspectives requires open communication about patients' expectations, needs and experiences in taking medication and about what might help them to become and remain adherent...|$|R

ANDI is widely viewed as the vehicle to implementing some of these recommendations. There is tremendous opportunity for Africa, to leverage the expertise in natural products and traditional medicines in support of this objective to kick-start innovation.

This paper addresses these questions by focusing on a behind-the-scenes ethnography of an exhibition celebrating 30 years of Doi Moi – the economic reform period in Vietnam that commenced in 1986. Focusing on the museum as method – the process of documenting how curators deliberate over labels, objects, photos and so forth – the paper analyses how national narratives are authored and transformed through curatorial exchanges and <b>expert</b> <b>forums.</b> By focusing on how aesthetics and achievement provide a foundation for inclusive interpretative strategies that integrate official histories alongside personal memories, this paper reflects on the alienating effects of official histories in state institutions and the strategies by which people appropriate these to reclaim their past...|$|R
