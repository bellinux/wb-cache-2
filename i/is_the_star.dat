It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers, i.e. 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.|$|E

25|$|At {{the center}} of the Crab Nebula are two faint stars, one of which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> {{responsible}} for the existence of the nebula. It was identified as such in 1942, when Rudolf Minkowski found that its optical spectrum was extremely unusual. The region around the star was found to be a strong source of radio waves in 1949 and X-rays in 1963, and was identified as one of the brightest objects in the sky in gamma rays in 1967. Then, in 1968, the star was found to be emitting its radiation in rapid pulses, becoming one of the first pulsars to be discovered.|$|E

25|$|Rosenzweig's major work <b>is</b> <b>The</b> <b>Star</b> of Redemption (first {{published}} in 1921). It is {{a description of}} the relationships between God, humanity, and the world, as they are connected by creation, revelation and redemption. If one makes a diagram with God at the top, and the World and the Self below, the inter-relationships generate a Star of David map. He is critical of any attempt to replace actual human existence with an ideal. In Rosenzweig's scheme, revelation arises not in metaphysics but in the here and now. We are called to love God, and to do so is to return to the world, and that is redemption.|$|E
500|$|Indian tribes were {{familiar}} with the painted turtle—young braves were trained to recognize its splashing into water as an alarm—and incorporated it in folklore. A Potawatomi myth describes how the talking turtles, [...] "Painted Turtle" [...] and allies [...] "Snapping Turtle" [...] and [...] "Box Turtle", outwit the village women. Painted Turtle <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> of the legend and uses his distinctive markings to trick a woman into holding him so he can bite her. An Illini myth recounts how Painted Turtle put his paint on to entice a chief's daughter into the water.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the series}} never {{specifically}} explains the three dots {{written on the}} Connors' basement wall in [...] "", reviewers (including IGN, TWoP, and Total Sci-Fis Owen Van Spall) attributed them to this episode's revelation of the Terminators' temporal triangulation ability. [...] Van Spall and TWoP also noted the plot point of the T-888's mission to kill the governor of California. [...] Stark's assassination mission was to take place on New Year's Eve 2010, at which time Arnold Schwarzenegger would still be the Californian governor (leaving office in January 2011); Schwarzenegger <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> {{of the first three}} Terminator films in the franchise, having premiered the role in 1984.|$|E

500|$|As widely {{considered}} traditional, predictable, and wholesome publishers {{to the nth degree}} for generations, Archie Comics' open recognition of homosexuality through {{the addition of}} Kevin Keller came as a surprise to many readers. However, as Lyle Masaki of AfterElton.com recognizes, [...] "There is a long-standing misconception that sexuality has {{to be a part of}} a gay character, but being gay doesn't have anything to do with sex." [...] Kevin went on to star in his own mini-series, and now <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> of his own digest-size series, and guest starred in the Life with Archie: The Married Life series, with the issue depicting his wedding becoming one of the fastest selling Archie comics in decades.|$|E
500|$|When Four Leaf and {{pyrotechnics}} operator Cody Underwood try {{to locate}} the dead director, they are captured by Flaming Dragon. Four Leaf is revealed to have hands; he confesses to Underwood that he actually served in the Coast Guard, has never left the United States, and that he wrote his [...] "memoir" [...] as [...] "a tribute". As the actors continue through the jungle, Kirk and Kevin discover that Tugg is leading them in the wrong direction. The resulting argument results in Lazarus leading {{the rest of the}} cast as an increasingly delirious Tugg is captured by Flaming Dragon. Taken to their base, Tugg believes it is a POW camp from the script. The gang discovers he <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> of their favorite film, the box office bomb Simple Jack, and force him to reenact it several times a day.|$|E
500|$|Continuing the Bad Wolf story {{arc of the}} series, {{the nuclear}} power station is named [...] "Blaidd Drwg", which means [...] "bad wolf" [...] in the Welsh language. This was the first {{reference}} to be explicitly addressed by the Doctor and Rose. The Rift was established earlier in the series in [...] "The Unquiet Dead", and the Doctor refuels there again in [...] "Utopia" [...] (2007). The place where the TARDIS lands in Roald Dahl Plass develops unusual properties, {{as seen in the}} spin-off series Torchwood. Rose mentions that she and the Doctor have been to Justicia, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> system that they visit in the New Series Adventures novel The Monsters Inside by Stephen Cole. Blaine says that as a child she was threatened with being fed to venom grubs; these creatures appeared in the First Doctor serial The Web Planet (1965).|$|E

500|$|Mainstream comics—the {{genre of}} superhero comics {{published}} in the United States since the late 1930s—have historically excluded gay characters, and the superhero genre and its two largest publishing houses, Marvel Comics and DC Comics, have been criticised for their lack of inclusivity. Transgender characters have likewise been under-represented, although the common storyline of a superhero having their sex changed by magical or technological means has been regarded as an oblique reference to transgender and transsexual issues. Queer theory analyses have noted that LGBT characters in mainstream comic books are often shown as assimilated into heterosexual society, whereas in alternative comics the diversity and uniqueness of LGBT culture is at the forefront. Mainstream comics have also been labelled as [...] "heteronormative", in comparison to [...] "integrationist" [...] alternative comics. Since the 1990s LGBT themes have become more common in mainstream US comics, including {{in a number of}} titles in which a gay character <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>star.</b>|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] {{music video}} {{presents}} {{an early version}} of Madonna's musings about her Italian-American heritage and focus on her feminocentric street theology, which was also explicitly brought out by 1987's Who's That Girl World Tour. It starts with the little boy trying to go inside a peep show, where Madonna <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> performer, but gets rebuffed by an old man at the ticket booth. Inside Madonna starts singing the song from the center of a carousel that revolves to display her to the gaze of the customers who are sitting safely in their cubicles. Madonna is dressed in a black bustier, spike heels, fishnets, revealing her new slimmed down body at that time. She begins the video wearing a black wig which she subsequently removes, revealing her short bleached hair. The bluish and dark lighting reveals her look as a mix of actresses Marlene Dietrich in the movie The Blue Angel as well as Liza Minnelli as the character Sally Bowles in the Bob Fosse-directed musical film, Cabaret.|$|E
500|$|Since the 1990s LGBT themes {{have become}} more common in {{mainstream}} US comics, including {{in a number of}} titles in which a gay character <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>star.</b> European comics have been more inclusive from an earlier date. The lack of censorship, and greater acceptance of comics as a medium of adult entertainment led to less controversy about the representation of LGBT characters. The popular Japanese manga tradition has included genres of girls' comics that feature homosexual relationships since the 1970s, in the form of yaoi and yuri. These works are often extremely romantic and idealized, and include archetypal characters that often do not identify as gay or lesbian. Since the Japanese [...] "gay boom" [...] of the 1990s, a body of manga by queer creators aimed at LGBT customers has been established, including both bara manga for gay men and yuri aimed at lesbians, which often have more realistic and autobiographical themes. Pornographic manga also often includes sexualised depictions of lesbians and intersex people. Queer theorists have noted that LGBT characters in mainstream comic books are usually shown as assimilated into heterosexual society, whereas in alternative comics the diversity and uniqueness of LGBT culture is emphasized.|$|E
