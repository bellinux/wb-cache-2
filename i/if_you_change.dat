Author Douglas Hofstadter, in Gödel, Escher, Bach, characterizes the distinction in this way. Logic is done inside a system while reason is done outside the system by such methods as skipping steps, working backward, drawing diagrams, looking at examples, or seeing what happens <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>change</b> the rules of the system.|$|E
500|$|Muddy Waters {{recorded}} After the Rain {{the following}} year, incorporating {{elements of the}} sound of Electric Mud. According to Cosey, [...] "I'll never forget, as soon as I walked into the studio for the follow-up and Muddy saw me, he threw his arms around me, said 'Hey, how you doing, boy, play some of that stuff you played on that last album.'" [...] Following strong criticism of the album, Muddy Waters claimed that he disliked the album and its sound, {{and that he did}} not consider the album to be blues. He stated, [...] "Every time I go into Chess, [...] put some un-blues players with me [...] <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>change</b> my sound, then you gonna change the whole man." [...] In the biography The Mojo Man, Muddy Waters stated [...] "That Electric Mud record was dogshit. But when it came out, it started selling like wild, but then they started sending them back. They said, 'This can't be Muddy Waters with all this shit going on, all this wha-wha and fuzztone.'" [...] AllMusic reviewer Richie Unterberger panned the album as being [...] "crass".|$|E
2500|$|MacIsaac plays a {{right-handed}} fiddle left-handed, {{most notably}} {{allowing it to}} remain strung right-handed, a highly unusual style of playing. MacIsaac however explained in a 2014 interview for the Celtic Colours Festival that during his first fiddle lesson with Stan Chapman when his father asked if he should change the strings around the other way, Stan said [...] "Well, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>change</b> the strings on your fiddle, you'll {{never be able to}} play anyone else's fiddle. So if he's gonna learn that way, learn that way". MacIsaac also elaborated in the same interview that his unorthodox playing style keeps the lower notes on the lower side of the fiddle and then he goes up to the higher notes; [...] "It just makes sonic sense to me", he said.|$|E

2500|$|Peter Jackson, {{producer}} of the remake that later began, said in 2006 that [...] "It is not our intention to offend people. But really {{you are in a}} no-win, damned-if-you-do-and-damned-if-you-don't scenario: [...] <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>change</b> it, everyone's going to whinge and whine about political correctness. And if you don't change it, obviously you are offending a lot of people inadvertently. [...] We haven't made any decisions about what we'll do." [...] Stephen Fry, writer for the remake, was asked to provide several alternative names for the dog, and came up with several suggestions. [...] Executive producer David Frost rejected them all, saying [...] "Guy sometimes used to call his dog Nigsy, so I think that's what we will call it. Stephen has been coming up with other names, but this is the one I want." [...] Jackson's assistant contradicted this a week later, however, saying [...] "To stay true to the story, you can't just change [...] We have not made any decisions yet. The script is still being written; and that decision will be made closer to the time." ...|$|E
2500|$|In physics, {{as well as}} mathematics, a vector {{is often}} {{identified}} with a tuple of components, or list of numbers, that act as scalar coefficients {{for a set of}} basis vectors. When the basis is transformed, for example by rotation or stretching, then the components of any vector in terms of that basis also transform in an opposite sense. The vector itself has not changed, but the basis has, so the components of the vector must change to compensate. The vector is called covariant or contravariant depending on how the transformation of the vector's components is related to the transformation of the basis. In general, contravariant vectors are [...] "regular vectors" [...] with units of distance (such as a displacement) or distance times some other unit (such as velocity or acceleration); covariant vectors, on the other hand, have units of one-over-distance such as gradient. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>change</b> units (a special case of a change of basis) from meters to millimeters, a scale factor of 1/1000, a displacement of 1m becomes 1000mm–a contravariant change in numerical value. In contrast, a gradient of 1K/m becomes 0.001K/mm–a covariant change in value. See covariance and contravariance of vectors. Tensors are another type of quantity that behave in this way; a vector is one type of tensor.|$|E
2500|$|Russell Barkley {{believes}} labeling is {{a double-edged}} sword; {{there are many}} pitfalls to labeling but by using a precise label, services can be accessed. He also believes that labeling can help the individual understand and make an informed decision how best {{to deal with the}} diagnoses using evidence-based knowledge. Furthermore studies also show that the education of the siblings and parents has at least a short-term impact on the outcome of treatment. Barkley states this about ADHD rights: [...] "... because of various legislation that has been passed to protect them. There are special education laws with the Americans with Disabilities Act, for example, mentioning ADHD as an eligible condition. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>change</b> the label, and again refer to it as just some variation in normal temperament, these people will lose access to these services, and will lose these hard-won protections that keep them from being discriminated against. ..." [...] Psychiatrist Harvey Parker, who founded CHADD, states, [...] "we should be celebrating the fact that school districts across the country are beginning to understand and recognize kids with ADHD, and are finding ways of treating them. We should celebrate the fact that the general public doesn't look at ADHD kids as [...] "bad" [...] kids, as brats, but as kids who have a problem that they can overcome". However, children may be ridiculed at school by their peers for using psychiatric medications including those for ADHD.|$|E
