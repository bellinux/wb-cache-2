The majority of leukemia cells were enriched in the L subpopulation and the same clone {{was included in the}} D and L subpopulations, suggesting clonal evolution. In this study, we analyzed patients with indolent-type ATL and human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) asymptomatic carriers (ACs) to see whether the CD 3 versus CD 7 profile reflected progression in the properties of HTLV-I-infected cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patient samples, we performed multi-color flow cytometry. Cells that underwent fluorescence-activated cell sorting were subjected to molecular analyses, including <b>inverse</b> long <b>PCR.</b> RESULTS: In the D(%) versus L(%) plot, patient data could largely be categorized into three groups (Group 1 : AC; Group 2 : smoldering- and chronic-type ATL; and Group 3 : acute-type ATL). Some exceptions, however, were noted (e. g., ACs in Group 2). In the follow-up of some patients, clinical disease progression correlated well with the CD 3 versus CD 7 profile. In clonality analysis, we clearly detected a major clone in the D and L subpopulations in ATL cases and, intriguingly, in some ACs in Group 2. CONCLUSION: We propose that the CD 3 versus CD 7 plot reflects progression of disease stage in patients infected with HTLV-I. The CD 3 versus CD 7 profile will be a new indicator, along with high proviral load, for HTLV-I ACs in forecasting disease progression...|$|R

Hepatocyte clones containing unique virus-cell DNA junctions formed by the integration of HBV DNA were detected using <b>inverse</b> nested <b>PCR.</b> The maximum hepatocyte clone size tended to increase with age, although there was considerable patient-to-patient variation in each age group. There was an upward trend in maximum clone size with increasing fibrosis, inflammatory activity and with seroconversion from HBV e-antigen (HBeAg) -positive to HBeAg-negative, but these differences did not reach statistical significance. Maximum hepatocyte clone size did not differ between patients with and without a coexisting hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, large hepatocyte clones containing integrated HBV DNA were detected during all stages of chronic HBV infection. Using laser microdissection, no significant difference in clone size was observed between foci of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) -positive and HBsAg-negative hepatocytes, suggesting that expression of HBsAg is not a significant factor in clonal expansion. Laser microdissection also revealed that hepatocytes with normal-appearing histology make up a major fraction of the cells undergoing clonal expansion. Thus, preneoplasia {{does not appear to be}} a factor in the clonal expansion detected in our assays. Computer simulations suggest that the large hepatocyte clones are not produced by random hepatocyte turnover but have an as-yet-unknown selective advantage that drives increased clonal expansion in the HBV-infected liver.

The purified enzyme was homogeneous with the estimated molecular mass of 19 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE and gel filtration. The Lip-SBRN 2 was stable in a pH range of 9 – 11 and temperature range of 45 – 60 °C. The enzyme was a non metallo-monomeric protein and was active against pNP-caprylate (C 8) and pNP-laurate (C 12) and coconut oil.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a novel double Amplification Refractory Mutation System (double ARMS) using a highly polymorphic region 5 ' to the human delta-globin gene as a model system. The double ARMS approach involves using two allele-specific ARMS primers simultaneously during DNA amplification by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The resulting system is highly sensitive and more specific than single ARMS. In addition, this approach enables the elucidation {{of the relationship of}} polymorphic sites on the same chromosome and thus allows the direct determination of haplotypes. We have also demonstrated that this system can be used in conjunction with <b>inverse</b> <b>PCR,</b> the resulting double ARMS <b>inverse</b> <b>PCR</b> (DARMSI-PCR) may allow haplotype determination on polymorphic sites which are separated further apart than the length limit imposed by PCR. The double ARMS approach has numerous other applications in molecular biology including HLA typing, virology, forensic pathology and the investigation of the phenomenon of chimerism following bone marrow transplantation...|$|E
30|$|To {{obtain the}} DNA {{sequences}} flanking the T-DNA inserts in the recipient genome, we adopted TAIL-PCR and <b>inverse</b> <b>PCR</b> using genomic DNA isolated from randomly selected transformants. We first performed TAIL-PCR, which produced readable {{segments of the}} recipient genome adjacent to {{both sides of the}} T-DNA from all transformants (13 / 13 transformants) harboring the T-DNA as a single copy. However, when the T-DNA existed in the recipient genome with the vector backbone or as concatemeric bands with or without the vector backbone at a single locus, segments derived from the vector or the T-DNA tended to be amplified rather than the recipient genome. Therefore, the DNA sequences flanking the T-DNA inserts could only be identified on one side in 5 of 13 transformants. The T-DNA integration with a vector backbone made it difficult to rescue the flanks of the T-DNA border. To rescue the recipient genome flanking the T-DNA irrespective of its integration mode, we performed <b>inverse</b> <b>PCR</b> or TAIL-PCR on the recipient genome digested with restriction enzymes, as described in the Materials and Methods section. We considered that the trimming of a vector backbone or concatemeric T-DNA fragments attached to the recipient genomic DNA would increase the rescue rate for either side flanking the T-DNA. Indeed, the flanks were obtained in 5 out of 6 transformants by TAIL-PCR and 5 out of 5 transformants by <b>inverse</b> <b>PCR</b> using recipient genomic DNA digested with restriction enzymes. However, it remains challenging to rescue the flanks if the vector backbone is attached to both sides of the T-DNA or if the selected restriction sites do not exist near the T-DNA integration locus. In this case, we confirmed that {{the far side of the}} recipient genome was effectively rescued by TAIL-PCR using circular DNA produced by digestion with a restriction enzyme followed by ligation. Furthermore, we were able to identify T-DNA flanking sequences even though the T-DNA fragments were integrated into different loci, although only in one transformant. Our data indicate that the tagged genes in almost all of the transformants could be recovered by a combination of TAIL-PCR and <b>inverse</b> <b>PCR,</b> which satisfies the requirement for a successful gene tagging protocol.|$|E

40|$|Vibrio {{pathogenicity}} island- 2 (VPI- 2) is a 57 -kb region integrated at {{a transfer}} RNA (tRNA) -serine locus that encompasses VC 1758 to VC 1809 on the V. cholerae N 16961 genome and {{is present in}} pandemic isolates. VPI- 2 encodes a P 4 -like integrase, a restriction modification system, a Mu phage-like region, and a sialic acid metabolism region, as well as neuraminidase (VC 1784), which is a glycosylhydrolase known to release sialic acid from sialoglycoconjugates to unmask GM 1 gangliosides, the receptor for cholera toxin. We examined the tRNA-serine locus among the sequenced V. cholerae genomes and identified five variant VPI- 2 regions, four of which retained the sialometabolism region. Three variant VPI- 2 regions contained a type three secretion system. By using an <b>inverse</b> nested <b>PCR</b> approach, {{we found that the}} VPI- 2 region can form an extrachromosomal circular intermediate (CI) molecule after precise excision from its tRNA-serine attachment site. We constructed a knockout mutant of VC 1758 (int) with V. cholerae strain N 16961 and found that no excision PCR product was produced, indicating that a functional cognate, VPI- 2 integrase, is required for excision. The Vibrio seventh pandemic island-I (VSP-I) and VSP-II regions are present in V. cholerae O 1 El Tor and O 139 serogroup isolates. Novel regions are present at the VSP-I insertion site in strain MZO- 3 and at the VSP-II insertion site in strain 623 - 39. VSP-II is a 27 -kb region that integrates at a tRNA-methionine locus, is flanked by direct repeats, and encodes a P 4 -like integrase. We show that VSP-II can excise and form a CI and that the cognate VSP-II integrase is required for excision. Interestingly, VSP-I is not inserted at a tRNA locus and does encode a XerDC-like recombinase, but similar to VPI- 2 and VSP-II, VSP-I does excise from the genome to form a CI. These results show that all three pathogenicity islands can excise from the chromosome, which is likely a first step in their horizontal transfer...|$|R
40|$|Chemometric {{calibration}} of near Infrared (NIR) {{spectra of}} biological fluids such as interstitial fluid and human serum to predict glucose concentration remains a challenge. As the biological fluids exhibit multiple light scattering, the pathlength travelled by {{light through the}} medium is not fixed. The complexity of systems increases not only due to scattering and chemical interference from other absorbing species, but also from variation in chemical composition and environmental conditions of measurements. From spectroscopic point of view, the chemometric calibration using classical least squares (CLS) method based on a linear additive model (Beer-Lambert law) is the most intuitive. However, this gives typically poor performance in practice, because the concentrations of all contributing components are needed to build a good prediction model. In the implicit or <b>inverse</b> approach (<b>PCR,</b> PLS) the concentration(s) to be predicted are modeled as a sum of the measured signals multiplied by estimated regression coefficients. Although this is less intuitive, good prediction results can be obtained even if not all concentrations of contributing components are known. To obtain good estimates for the regression coefficients, and thus also good prediction performance, a “representative” calibration set is essential. This is not trivial, because not only the expected variation in the component(s) of interest should be included, but also the variation of the other contributing factors (interferents) and their correlations. Several methodologies have been proposed to robustify inverse models against these changes in the interferent structure. One of the widely used strategies is to filter out {{the influence of the}} interferents using pre-processing techniques such as extended multiplicative scatter correction, pre-whitening, orthogonal signal correction, external parameter orthogonalization, etc. In present study, NIR spectra of aqueous glucose solution and human serum are recorded in carefully designed experiments. Various pre-processing techniques combined with PLS are tried with the aim of achieving good prediction accuracy for PLS models by either effectively filtering the non-specific variations or by including known sources of error in the model to make it insensitive to the change in interferent structure. status: publishe...|$|R
