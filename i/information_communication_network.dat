The effective analysis on mining of the network alarm association rules is achieved by incorporating classic data association mining algorithm and swarm intelligence optimization algorithm. From the related concept of the <b>information</b> <b>communication</b> <b>network,</b> the paper analyzes the data characteristics and association logic of the network alarms. Besides, the alarm data are preprocessed and the main standardization information fields are screened. The APPSO algorithm is proposed {{on the basis of}} combining the evaluation method for support and confidence coefficient in the Apriori (AP) algorithm as well as the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. By establishing a sparse linked list, the algorithm is able to calculate the particle support thus further improving the performance of the APPSO algorithm. Based on the test for the network alarm data, it is discovered that rational setting of the particle swarm scale and number of iterations of the APPSO algorithm can be used to mine the vast majority and even all of the association rules and the mining efficiency is significantly improved, compared with Apriori algorithm...|$|E

Also, we {{consider the}} impact of accuracy of information {{and the number of}} agents on the identification of receivers under the condition of dynamic network. Our study is related with previous studies. We found that the accuracy of information and the number of neighbors positively related with the identification ability of receivers, which is consistent with the Benabou and Laroque (1992) and the Krishna and Morgan (2001) or Klumpp (2007). Moreover, our paper made more considerations on the dynamic searching behavior in the cheap talk communication. We not only reach conclusions of available literatures about the influence of number of neighbors and information accuracy on identification, but also found relationships between the dynamic <b>information</b> <b>communication</b> <b>network</b> and identification ability, which are the previous models did not give a explicit description.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Entities in an <b>information</b> <b>communication</b> <b>network</b> may use {{various types}} of {{collaborative}} networking for sharing information such as documents, sensing reports, datasets, etc. The derivation history (i. e., the provenance) of the information plays {{a very important role}} in such a networking environment. For example, provenance can be used for information trustworthiness assessment, copyright clearance, data reconciliation, and data replication. While substantial research efforts have focused on these usages of provenance, very limited work has focused on the security issues of the provenance, which is the prerequisite of any provenance-based information analysis systems. In this paper, we explore the security properties of provenance meta-data compared to other general user data in a distributed network environment. We introduce a “chain-structure ” provenance scheme to provide security assurance for the provenance meta-data in three dimensions- confidentiality, integrity and availability. Our scheme outperforms the previously proposed “onion-structure” provenance security scheme in terms of the flexibility, protection capability as well as computational overhead...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—As the disfunctions of the {{information}} society and social development progress, intrusion problems such as malicious replies, spam mail, private information leakage, phishing, and pharming, and side effects such as the spread of unwholesome information and privacy invasion are becoming serious social problems. Illegal access to information is also becoming a problem as the exchange and sharing of information increases {{on the basis of}} the extension of the communication network. On the other hand, as the communication network has been constructed as an international, global system, the legal response against invasion and cyber-attack from abroad is facing its limit. In addition, in an environment where the important infrastructures are managed and controlled {{on the basis of the}} <b>information</b> <b>communication</b> <b>network,</b> such problems pose a threat to national security. Countermeasures to such threats are developed and implemented on a yearly basis to protect the major infrastructures of information communication.

Quick decision-making, data based-planning, effective implementation through quantitative techniques seemed to clinch the issue in its favour. The Information revolution promises {{to change the world}} like never before. The objective {{of this paper is to}} examine and analyzing the improving citizens interface with the government through electronic means in India. For this purpose we selected the Andhra Pradesh (herein after referred as AP) state in India. In the state of AP, IT is an important tool for governance. AP is the first state in India for design a state – wide computerization programme covering al levels of the administrative spectrum from the smallest- the village level revenue offices- to the top most, largest and most powerful. The successful implementation of e-Governance in the administration in AP has indicated positive response by various communities. The analysis indicates that almost 100 percent respondents are appreciating the electronic means of operation of citizen services and use of computers in administration. It is saving their valuable time and money.

40|$|Microblog {{is one of}} the {{important}} social information communication platform. Because of its characteristics of easy operation and fast spread, people can directly and quickly express their attitude to emergencies, public figures, hot products and daily life through microblog. In order to utilize the vast microblog information, it needs to combine various microblog analysis methods to discover the potential value of information. This paper first reviews the current research of microblog analysis field and puts forward the independent research and development system of microblog analysis, then explores the future research direction of microblog analysis. First of all, this paper introduces two dominating technical methods of microblog analysis, including microblog open platform and web crawler technology. People can have convenient and prompt access to microblog information resources via open interface of microblog, such as microblog content, user reviews, user personal details, the number of fans, the number of attention, etc [...] But it also has many limitations. For example, it can only be grabbed for limited times every hour and it is not open for all the resources information. Utilizing the web crawler technology, more information resources can be obtained. For example, the information acquisition technology based on general web crawler can cover a wider range and based on the focused crawler, the predefined theme can be crawled selectively. Secondly, this paper presents the hot issues of current microblog, including analysis on users' behavior and microblog content. Research on microblog user behavior includes: 1) Research on <b>information</b> <b>communication</b> <b>network.</b> Its purpose is to predict future propagation, which uses Gephi visualization tools to present propagation path under microblog diffusion, propagation range and the key of forwarding nodes, etc [...] 2) Research on propagation factors. It reveals the possible causes of information dissemination by analyzing users' behavior. 3) Research on user's influence. Different scholars give different methods of measurement, while accurate evaluation of user's influence should take into account many factors, such as the number of fans, the forwarding number, mentioned numbers, reply, and social relationship, etc [...] Analysis of the microblog contents includes: 1) Microblog texts pretreatment, including words segmentation and stop words. 2) Microblog hot topic detection. Its methods include statistical method of word frequency and text clustering methods, which are beneficial to the improved detection effect of hot topics without considering the characteristics of dynamic topic evolution. 3) Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, has always been a hot issue in the research field of microblog. It can use microblog expression image to extract emotional words and combine with the method of constructing the semantic dictionary and machine learning to classify the sentiments of microblog, finally judge sentiment polarity of microblog. It can be used for public opinion monitoring, business forecasting and product selection, etc [...] Thirdly, we put forward We-Reading, an independent research and development system of microblog analysis, and introduce three main modules including sentiment analysis, geographical distribution and propagation graph expansion. Sentiment analysis module classifies users' comments sentiment based on the method of sentiment lexicon. Regional distribution module extracts the geographical position information of users and does statistical analysis in order to show the spread distribution of microblog nationwide. Propagation graph module uses visual means to represent the microblog broadcast of information diffusion, such as forwarding relations, forwarding layer, and forwarding scope, etc [...] Finally, this paper summarizes the challenging problems that microblog faces from two aspects of technology and applications. Technical analysis of microblog can break interface resource constraints, and improve the efficiency and precision of microblog analysis system. Practical analysis of microblog expands event monitoring, management application and commercial application...|$|E
