The relative error {{is defined as}} the absolute difference between fitted and true quantile divided by the true quantile.

40|$|We {{consider}} an age replacement problem with cost function {{based on the}} renewal reward theorem. However, instead of assuming a known probability distribution for the lifetimes, we apply Hill’s assumption A (n) for predicting probabilities for the lifetime of a future item. Lower and upper bounds for the survival function of a future item are used, resulting in upper and lower cost functions. Minimising these upper and lower cost functions to obtain the optimal age replacement times is simplified due to the special form of these functions. To discuss some features of our approach, we first study the consequences of using n <b>equally</b> <b>spaced</b> percentiles <b>from</b> a known distribution instead of n observed data.

40|$|We {{consider}} magnetic oscillations due to Landau quantization in {{the mixed}} state of type-II superconductors. Our work {{is based on}} a previously developed formalism which allows the mean-field gap equations of the Abrikosov state to be conveniently solved in a Landau level representation. We find that the quasiparticle band structure changes qualitatively when the pairing self-energy becomes comparable to the Landau level separation. For small pairing self- energies, Landau level mixing due to the superconducting order is weak and magnetic oscillations survive in the superconducting state although they are damped. We find that the width of the quasiparticle Landau levels in this regime varies approximately as Δ_ 0 n_μ^- 1 / 4 where Δ_ 0 is proportional to the magnitude of the order parameter and n_μ is the Landau level index at the Fermi energy. For larger pairing self-energies, the lowest energy quasiparticle bands occur in pairs which are nearly <b>equally</b> <b>spaced</b> <b>from</b> each other and evolve with weakening magnetic field toward the bound states of an isolated vortex core. These bands have a weak magnetic field dependence and magnetic oscillations vanish rapidly in this regime.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{present study}} {{aimed to develop}} a test {{procedure}} to diagnose and visualize errors in linearity of digitizing tablets. Errors of linearity are caused by the distortion of the x- and y-co-ordinates of the digitizing tablet. This results in a given object apparently having different dimensions when recorded on different locations of the digitizing surface. The test is performed by systematic recording of n <b>equally</b> <b>spaced</b> points <b>from</b> a calibrated test foil. Algorithms were developed to calculate the difference matrices DXji and DYji between expected and observed values of the co-ordinates. Three-dimensional mapping of the non-linearity of the x- and y-co-ordinates was performed by the UNIRAS-geopak®, a 3 -D surface representative system. The tested digitizers showed varying degrees of scaling errors, fields of non-linearity, and random noise. Most digitizers allow for correction of scaling by setting of switches in the control unit. A method is suggested for correction of non-linearities by use of the DXji and DYji matrices in the digitizing programme...|$|R

Inside this {{laboratory}} is the Nozzle Acoustic Test Rig (NATR), which is used in support of Advanced Subsonics Technology (AST) and High Speed Research (HSR) to test engine exhaust nozzles for thrust and acoustic performance under simulated takeoff conditions. Acoustic measurements had been gathered by a far-field array of microphones located along the dome wall and 10 -ft above the floor. Recently, it became desirable to collect acoustic data for engine certifications (as specified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)) that would simulate the noise of an aircraft taking off as heard from an offset ground location. Since nozzles for the High-Speed Civil Transport have straight sides that cause their noise signature to vary radially, an additional plane of acoustic measurement was required.

The microphones needed to be aimed at the nozzle accurately and held firmly in place during testing, {{but it was also}} essential that they be easily and routinely lowered to the floor for calibration and servicing. Once serviced, the microphones would have to be returned to their previous location near the ceiling. In addition, there could be no structure could between the microphones and the nozzle, and any structure near the microphones would have to be designed to minimize noise reflections.

40|$|Three {{experiments}} were conducted separately {{to estimate the}} digestible Lys (dig. Lys) requirements of Cobb × Cobb 500 male broilers using different statistical models. For each experiment, 1, 200 chicks were housed in 48 floor pens in a completely randomized design with 6 treatments and 8 replicates. Broilers were fed diets with increasing dig. Lys levels from 1 to 12 d (Exp. 1), from 12 to 28 d (Exp. 2), and 28 to 42 d (Exp. 3). Increasing dig. Lys levels were <b>equally</b> <b>spaced</b> <b>from</b> 0. 97 to 1. 37 % in Exp. 1, 0. 77 to 1. 17 % in Exp. 2, and 0. 68 to 1. 07 % in Exp. 3. The lowest dig.

In Exp. 3, six birds per pen {{were randomly selected from}} each replication to evaluate carcass and breast yields. Digestible Lys requirements were estimated by quadratic polynomial (QP), linear broken-line (LBL), quadratic broken-line (QBL), and exponential asymptotic (EA) models. Overall, dig.

40|$|Optical {{observations}} of thermospheric winds and temperatures determined with high resolution measurements of Doppler shifts and Doppler widths of the OI 630 -nm equatorial nightglow emission {{have been made}} with improved accuracy at Arequipa, Peru (16. 4 &deg; S, 71. 4 &deg; W) with an imaging Fabry-Perot interferometer. An observing procedure previously used at Arecibo Observatory was applied to achieve increased spatial and temporal sampling of the thermospheric wind and temperature with the selection of eight azimuthal directions, <b>equally</b> <b>spaced</b> <b>from</b> 0 to 360 &deg;, at a zenith angle of 60 &deg;. By assuming the equivalence of longitude and local time, the data obtained using this technique is analyzed to determine the mean neutral wind speeds and mean horizontal gradients of the wind field in the zonal and meridional directions. The new temperature measurements obtained with the improved instrumental accuracy clearly show the midnight temperature maximum (MTM) peak with amplitudes of 25 to 200 K in all directions observed for most nights. The horizontal wind field maps calculated from the mean winds and gradients show the MTM peak is always preceded by an equatorward wind surge lasting 1 &ndash; 2 h. The results also show for winter events a meridional wind abatement seen after the MTM peak. On one occasion, near the September equinox, a reversal was observed during the poleward transit of the MTM over Arequipa. Analysis inferring vertical winds from the observed convergence yielded inconsistent results, calling into question the validity of this calculation for the MTM structure at equatorial latitudes during solar minimum. Comparison of the observations with the predictions of the NCAR general circulation model indicates that the model fails to reproduce the observed amplitude {{by a factor of}} 5 or more. This is attributed in part to the lack of adequate spatial resolution in the model as the MTM phenomenon takes place within a scale of 300 &ndash; 500 km and ~ 45 min in local time. The model shortcoming is also attributed in part to the need for the model to include a hydrodynamical mechanism to describe the merging of the zonal wind with the meridional tidal winds that converge onto the geographical equator. Finally, a conclusion of this work is that the MTM compressional heating takes place along the perimeter of the pressure bulge rather than within the bulge, an issue previously not appreciated...|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} of whether intonation events have a categorical mental representation {{has long been a}} puzzle in prosodic research, and one that experiments testing production and perception across category boundaries have failed to definitively resolve. This paper takes the alternative approach of looking for evidence of structure within a postulated category by testing for a Perceptual Magnet Effect (PME). PME has been found in boundary tones but has not previously been conclusively found in pitch accents. In this investigation, perceived goodness and discriminability of re-synthesised Dutch nuclear rise contours (L*H H%) were evaluated by naive native speakers of Dutch. The variation between these stimuli was quantified using a polynomial-parametric modelling approach (i. e. the SOCoPaSul model) in place of the traditional approach whereby excursion size, peak alignment and pitch register are used independently of each other to quantify variation between pitch accents. Using this approach to calculate the acoustic-perceptual distance between different stimuli, PME was detected: (1) rated goodness, decreased as acoustic-perceptual distance relative to the prototype increased, and (2) <b>equally</b> <b>spaced</b> items far <b>from</b> the prototype were less frequently generalised than <b>equally</b> <b>spaced</b> items in the neighbourhood of the prototype.
