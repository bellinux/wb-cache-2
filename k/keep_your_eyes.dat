[...] According to Chris Schilling of VideoGamer.com, [...] "Enemy Unknown is respectful of Julian Gollop's 1994 turn-based strategy classic, but it's not reverential." [...] Charlie Hall of Ars Technica wrote that [...] "in the end, {{this is not the}} X-Com that everyone was expecting. It’s more. It’s better. If you’re merely looking for a highly competent re-skin of the original X-Com, <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> peeled for the upcoming Xenonauts." [...] Gollop himself said: ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with author Cicily Janus, Joseph commented that his perspective has changed {{a great deal from}} when he was younger. [...] He said, [...] "Everything I did was focused on making good music and being a great musician, not running a business. Yet it takes a businessperson to bring music to the masses." [...] But some artists just want to [...] be involved in the music and do not like the added problems or have the personality to work with both. [...] Joseph suggests newer artists read and study both courses and pick one that best suits their needs and wants. [...] He advises, [...] "...to <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> and ears open all the time. [...] All the information you need is available to you to have a successful career in music, if you're paying attention, and not closed off to anything." [...] He explains, [...] "Time and persistence has shown me that I can succeed at sharing my art with others as a musician while running my own music business. [...] And that kind of success is as good as I could have ever wished for." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 2 April 1801, Nelson began to advance into Copenhagen harbour. The battle began badly for the British, with , [...] and [...] running aground, {{and the rest of}} the fleet encountering heavier fire from the Danish shore {{batteries}} than had been anticipated. Parker sent the signal for Nelson to withdraw, reasoning:I will make the signal for recall for Nelson's sake. If he is in a condition to continue the action he will disregard it; if he is not, it will be an excuse for his retreat and no blame can be attached to him. Nelson, directing action aboard , was informed of the signal by the signal lieutenant, Frederick Langford, but angrily responded: [...] "I told you to look out on the Danish commodore and let me know when he surrendered. <b>Keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> fixed on him." [...] He then turned to his flag captain, Thomas Foley, and said [...] "You know, Foley, I have only one eye. I have a right to be blind sometimes." [...] He raised the telescope to his blind eye, and said [...] "I really do not see the signal." [...] The battle lasted three hours, leaving both Danish and British fleets heavily damaged. At length Nelson dispatched a letter to the Danish commander, Crown Prince Frederick, calling for a truce, which the Prince accepted. Parker approved of Nelson's actions in retrospect, and Nelson was given the honour of going into Copenhagen the next day to open formal negotiations. At a banquet that evening, he told Prince Frederick that the battle had been the most severe he had ever been in. The outcome of the battle and several weeks of ensuing negotiations was a 14-week armistice, and on Parker's recall in May, Nelson became commander-in-chief in the Baltic Sea. As a reward for the victory, he was created Viscount Nelson of the Nile and of Burnham Thorpe in the County of Norfolk, on 19 May 1801. In addition, on 4 August 1801, he was created Baron Nelson, of the Nile and of Hilborough in the County of Norfolk, this time with a special remainder to his father and sisters. Nelson had sailed to the Russian naval base at Reval (now Tallinn) in May, and there learned that the pact of armed neutrality was to be disbanded. Satisfied with the outcome of the expedition, he returned to England, arriving on 1 July.|$|E

He served as the Londons acting-signal lieutenant during the battle, sending Parker's famous signal for Nelson to withdraw.

[...] Spears added, [...] "she just has this presence that you're so drawn to her, you can't <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> off her." [...] Spears' rendition of [...] "Stronger" [...] on the Dream Within a Dream Tour referenced Jackson's performance of [...] "You", performing in a similar vein among masked dancers wearing one-piece attire. Several performances and themes of Spears' Onyx Hotel Tour drew comparisons for its choreography and sensuality, as well as a reworked lounge version of [...] "Baby One More Time" [...] sonically reminiscent of Jackson's [...] "Rope Burn." [...] Spears' following tour The Circus Starring Britney Spears used a circus theme, observed to be partially inspired by segments of the tour. During [...] "Lace and Leather" [...] on the Femme Fatale Tour, Spears performed a lap dance for a selected fan while wearing a boa after a pole dance, considered a direct reference to Jackson's performance of [...] "Rope Burn." [...] An analysis of Rihanna's Last Girl on Earth Tour observed there was [...] "definitely a Janet vibe", particularly comparing Jackson's performance of [...] "Rope Burn", [...] "in which she tied an audience member to a bed and proceeded to seduce them", to Rihanna's rendition of [...] "Skin." [...] The critique added, [...] "Fast forward 13 years later, and there was Rihanna, writhing around on a lucky audience member at the conclusion of Skin off her current Loud album." [...] New Zealand's Stuff.co.nz praised Lady Gaga's Born This Way Ball as the best [...] "pop-star show" [...] since Jackson's Velvet Rope Tour.|$|E
