5|$|Jerry {{knows what}} the {{situation}} is. I think he's done very well for us, considering we plucked him out of non-league football at Yeovil. But he is aware that I {{have been looking for}} a right-back and I will continue looking for one. That doesn't mean I don't appreciate what Jerry has done for me since I signed him three-and-a-half years ago. There isn't a more reliable player at the club than Jerry Gill. He captains my reserve team, his fitness is of a very high standard and he has endless enthusiasm. When I put him in the first team, he never lets me <b>down.</b> <b>I</b> value Jerry's professionalism and for as long as I remain manager of Birmingham, {{there will always be a}} place for him here.|$|E
25|$|We have weekly caucus meetings. We have daily {{leadership}} meetings. We have weekly ranking Member meetings. We have party effectiveness meetings. There's a {{lot more}} communication. I believe leadership is bottom up, not top <b>down.</b> <b>I</b> {{think you have to}} build policy and strategy and vision from the bottom up, and involve people in figuring out what that is.|$|E
25|$|We have a {{song called}} Charlie Brown, which was the centrepiece of this other record we started first. We were playing the riff on an {{accordion}} and Guy came in one morning and said, 'I'm afraid I have to put my foot <b>down.</b> <b>I</b> don't want to speak out of turn, but I will not allow this song to be played on an accordion - that has {{to go in with}} the Mylo bunch'. So then we thought — let's just make one album.|$|E

25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you <b>down.</b> <b>I</b> used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E
500|$|A {{shortage}} of new {{material and the}} slow progress of the sessions contributed to Dylan's decision to cancel three additional recording dates. Six weeks later Dylan confided to critic Robert Shelton, [...] "Oh, I was really <b>down.</b> <b>I</b> mean, in ten recording sessions, man, we didn't get one song... It was the band. But you see, I didn't know that. I didn't want to think that".|$|E
500|$|Fleance's line [...] "The moon is <b>down,</b> <b>I</b> {{have not}} heard the clock" [...] was the {{inspiration}} for the title of John Steinbeck's 1942 short novel The Moon is Down. Fleance's line foreshadows the evil encompassing the kingdom. The book was published just as the United States entered World War II and signalled the threat of the Axis powers by outlining the events in a European town occupied by foreign powers. Steinbeck's book became a Broadway play and a film.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Thunder" [...] is a ballad {{about finding}} the [...] "strength of rising after the fall" [...] and follows the self-empowerment {{theme of the}} album. The song begins with the lyrics [...] "First it was heaven, ev'rything roses and fire," [...] and she later proclaims [...] "I’m coming back with the thunder." [...] Lewis {{projects}} a stance of empowerment as she performs the line [...] "With an empty heart, I am free again" [...] over a [...] "striding" [...] beat accompanied by a piano. Angela Wilson of Vibe described the track as [...] "a celebratory salute to self love" [...] and highlighted the lines [...] "And I won’t wait any longer / When you let me <b>down,</b> <b>I</b> got stronger," [...] as empowering. Will Hodgkinson of The Times thought that [...] "Thunder" [...] was about her former record label boss and friend Simon Cowell, writing that the lyrics [...] "I won’t wait any longer, when you let me <b>down</b> <b>I</b> got stronger," [...] was Lewis' way of saying [...] "Check me out now, you high-waisted berk." [...] The song, in the key of B major, has a tempo of 92beats per minute. Lewis' voice spans more than two octaves, from F3 to G5.|$|E
500|$|Police constable Martin Spirito {{told the}} court that, on 2 February: [...] "The search {{commenced}} at 10.00am. At 10.24am {{one of the officers}} came up and said he had found a lifeless body. I followed the officer's line down. Six metres <b>down</b> <b>I</b> saw a white male. The male had a bottle of beer clenched in his right hand." [...] Police sergeant Roy Dawson, in charge of overseeing the dive, {{told the court}}: [...] "The bottle was held in his right hand. It fell from his hand on the ascent." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon retirement, Barkley {{was later}} quoted as stating, {{in regard to}} his career, [...] "I was fairly controversial, I guess, but I regret only one thing—the {{spitting}} incident. But you know what? It taught me a valuable lesson. It taught me that I was getting way too intense during the game. It let me know I wanted to win way too bad. I had to calm <b>down.</b> <b>I</b> wanted to win at all costs. Instead of playing the game the right way and respecting the game, I only thought about winning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] Wrayson answered. [...] "She is, {{for some}} reason--I {{do not know}} why--estranged from her family. Now the {{question}} arises, has this fellow here come over to track her <b>down?</b> <b>Is</b> he an English detective?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He must do, then," [...] Mr. Brook said, [...] "but I wish Mr. Thompson {{had been}} here. Perhaps {{you would like}} to look at the plan of the pit before you go <b>down?</b> <b>Is</b> Williams's office open?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. <b>Downs,</b> <b>I</b> {{am glad to}} meet you, and to {{know you}} will go with me. I thank God I shall take into the {{wilderness}} one who is young enough {{to carry on the}} work when my days are done." ...|$|R
500|$|Newman was, {{according}} to Nilsson, [...] "tired {{of the album}} when we were finished making it." [...] "For him it was just doing piano and voice... over and over." [...] Nilsson explained [...] "once I got the take <b>down,</b> <b>I</b> knew what I {{was going to do}} with it later. He didn't." [...] Newman said of his experience that he [...] "was honored that a writer with Harry's talent would choose to do an album of someone else's songs." [...] Newman continued, [...] "he was such a great singer, a virtuoso singer, really, and he could do so many things as a vocalist that I couldn't do—like hold a note." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Live Together, Die Alone" [...] {{has been}} {{generally}} well received. IGN's Eric Goldman praised actor Henry Ian Cusick (Desmond Hume) for giving [...] "a likable, sympathetic performance". Goldman {{went on to}} say that the episode [...] "was a much better finale than last season", and that it contained one of the [...] "more interesting flashbacks of the entire season". Entertainment Weekly writer Scott Brown described his viewing experience as [...] "I was up, I was <b>down,</b> <b>I</b> was frustrated, I was thrilled, and finally I was...well, a bit numb." [...] Brown criticized the way Charlie reacted to the hatch explosion, stating that he felt the writers were trying to [...] "get us to hate Charlie".|$|E
500|$|After {{taking a}} year off, Gil Cates was {{selected}} by AMPAS in November 1996 to oversee production of the ceremony for the seventh time. Immediately, he chose actor and comedian Billy Crystal to host the 1997 telecast, stating, [...] "Billy is quick and agile and bright, and he plays the unexpected events of the live telecast like a Stradivarius. He's become the standard against which all other hosting performances are measured." [...] Crystal expressed his excitement on hosting the ceremony {{for the fifth time}} joking, [...] "Once Barry Scheck turned it <b>down,</b> <b>I</b> had a feeling they'd come to me." [...] Furthermore he set up a website with the address www.whyistheshowsolong.com asking the public to send in jokes that would eventually be used during the gala.|$|E
5000|$|During a 2008 {{interview}} to promote its expanded CD reissue, Duffy commented that [...] "I never liked The Ups and <b>Downs.</b> <b>I</b> enjoyed mixing with Stephen Street and making 'The Icing on the Cake' {{but the rest}} of it is just a mess." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'That Christmas week {{twenty-two years}} ago, when the late Duchess's cousin Frederick implored her {{to meet him}} on Marlbury <b>Downs.</b> <b>I</b> saw the meeting--it {{was just such a}} night as this--and I, as you know, saw more. She met him once, but not the second time.' ...|$|R
500|$|Armagh manager Joe Kernan {{claimed he}} would have {{resigned}} had his side won but defeat encouraged him to continue. He lauded his players for their effort nonetheless, saying: [...] "..we've won an All-Ireland, and {{got back to the}} final. I think that's a phenomenal achievement." [...] He added that he was confident Armagh would win another title in the future. Of the match itself, Kernan said: [...] "I think if Steven McDonnell had got that goal towards the end, even with the man <b>down</b> <b>I</b> think we would have won the game. Big matches hinge on certain things {{and that was one of}} them." [...] McDonnell applauded Conor Gormley's tackle which prevented him from scoring: [...] "...I'd say it was one of the best tackles ever." ...|$|E
500|$|Apart {{from their}} protests, Theroux {{found them to}} be quite kind, and commented, [...] "It shows you what strange avenues the {{religious}} impulse can take you <b>down.</b> <b>I</b> think another part of the answer is that parts of the Christian Bible are pretty weird. There's a lot of weird stuff in there and when you take that and you add this angry, domineering kind of a father figure, which is Gramps, and you add that he has sort of separated them off from other people, other families and driven them to achieve a lot, and he was kind of a charismatic guy, and still is up to a point. He was a very verbal, very persuasive, an extremely compelling speaker. All these things added together combined to make a powerful influence." ...|$|E
500|$|Author Ian Inglis interprets [...] "Far East Man" [...] {{as being}} about Indian sitar maestro Ravi Shankar, for whom Harrison had staged the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971. Three years later, {{with the new}} nation of Bangladesh still beset by problems, and {{conflict}} clouding the issue of friendship generally for Harrison, Inglis suggests that [...] "this is one friendship [...] is determined to preserve". The choruses therefore promise: [...] "I won't let him <b>down</b> ... <b>I</b> won't let him drown ..." [...] Harrison later credited Shankar with being [...] "probably {{the person who has}} influenced my life the most", since [...] "Indian music was like a stepping-stone to the spiritual path". Inglis views the song as reflecting Harrison's commitment to [...] "all the things that India has given him".|$|E

500|$|In January 2009, Rourke and Rockwell entered {{negotiations}} {{to play a}} pair of villains. A few days later, Rockwell confirmed {{he would take the}} role, and that his character would be Justin Hammer. Paul Bettany confirmed that he would be returning to voice J.A.R.V.I.S. Marvel entered into early talks with Emily Blunt to play the Black Widow, though she was unable to take the role due to a previous commitment to star in Gulliver's Travels. Samuel L. Jackson confirmed that he had been in discussions to reprise the role of Nick Fury from the first film's post-credits scene, but that contract disputes were making a deal difficult. Jackson claimed that [...] "There was a huge kind of negotiation that broke <b>down.</b> <b>I</b> don't know. Maybe I won't be Nick Fury." ...|$|E
500|$|North's low {{academic}} {{results have}} led to criticism. In February 2007 Minneapolis City Council member Don Samuels suggested burning North down. [...] "My children will not darken {{the door of a}} Minneapolis public school in this city at this time under these conditions. I've said burn North High School <b>down!</b> <b>I</b> can't be paying as a taxpayer for the education of my neighbors and 72 percent of them are failing—meaning black boys. Something worse than vouchers could come along. If it works, if it sacrifices the entire school system, fine! Get rid of the damn thing! It hasn't worked!" [...] His suggestion caused uproar in the community, and his remarks were heavily criticized. Samuels later apologized for the [...] "extreme language" [...] but stated that he did not regret making the comments.|$|E
500|$|Reddick drew {{inspiration}} for the episode from undercover FBI agent Joe Pistone, whom he met while filming the TV series Falcone. Pistone recommended his autobiography , and Reddick found many parallels to it and the episode. [...] "In the book, [...] talked about how while being undercover in the Mafia, he had to separate his personal feelings from his professional and moral sense of responsibility. There were certain guys he really couldn’t stand, {{but there were some}} people he genuinely liked, even though ultimately he had to bring them <b>down.</b> <b>I</b> think Col. Broyles feels the same way about Olivia. On various occasions, she has performed heroically to earn his respect, and in tonight’s episode, that appreciation — and the angst that goes with it — reaches a new level".|$|E
