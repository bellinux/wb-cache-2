5|$|Kinetic models {{describe}} the particle velocity <b>distribution</b> <b>function</b> at each {{point in the}} plasma and therefore {{do not need to}} assume a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. A kinetic description is often necessary for collisionless plasmas. There are two common approaches to kinetic description of a plasma. One is based on representing the smoothed <b>distribution</b> <b>function</b> on a grid in velocity and position. The other, known as the particle-in-cell (PIC) technique, includes kinetic information by following the trajectories {{of a large number of}} individual particles. Kinetic models are generally more computationally intensive than fluid models. The Vlasov equation may be used to {{describe the}} dynamics of a system of charged particles interacting with an electromagnetic field.|$|E

5|$|The concept {{underlying}} {{the method is}} based on the probability integral transform, in that a set of independent random samples derived from any random variable should on average be uniformly distributed with respect to the cumulative <b>distribution</b> <b>function</b> of the random variable. The MPS method chooses the parameter values that make the observed data as uniform as possible, according to a specific quantitative measure of uniformity.|$|E
5|$|There {{are certain}} distributions, {{especially}} those with three or more parameters, whose likelihoods may become infinite along certain paths in the parameter space. Using maximum likelihood to estimate these parameters often breaks down, with one parameter tending to the specific value that causes the likelihood to be infinite, rendering the other parameters inconsistent. The method of maximum spacings, however, being dependent on the difference between points on the cumulative <b>distribution</b> <b>function</b> and not individual likelihood points, does not have this issue, and will return valid results over a much wider array of distributions.|$|E

5|$|In {{most cases}} the {{electrons}} are close enough to thermal equilibrium that their temperature is relatively well-defined, even {{when there is a}} significant deviation from a Maxwellian energy <b>distribution</b> <b>function,</b> for example, due to UV radiation, energetic particles, or strong electric fields. Because of the large difference in mass, the electrons come to thermodynamic equilibrium amongst themselves much faster than they come into equilibrium with the ions or neutral atoms. For this reason, the ion temperature may be very different from (usually lower than) the electron temperature. This is especially common in weakly ionised technological plasmas, where the ions are often near the ambient temperature.|$|E

40|$|Quasi-parton <b>distribution</b> <b>functions</b> have {{received}} a lot of attentions in both perturbative QCD and lattice QCD communities in recent years because they not only carry good information on the parton <b>distribution</b> <b>functions,</b> but also could be evaluated by lattice QCD simulations. However, unlike the parton <b>distribution</b> <b>functions,</b> the quasi-parton <b>distribution</b> <b>functions</b> have perturbative ultraviolet power divergences because they are not defined by twist- 2 operators. In this paper, we identify all sources of ultraviolet divergences for the quasi-parton <b>distribution</b> <b>functions</b> in coordinate-space, and demonstrate that power divergences, as well as all logarithmic divergences can be renormalized multiplicatively to all orders in QCD perturbation theory.
