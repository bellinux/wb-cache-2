5|$|The {{majority}} of the inhabitants today are Muslim, but there are small Christian and Samaritan communities as well. Much of the local Palestinian Muslim population of Nablus {{is believed to be}} descended from Samaritans who converted to Islam. Certain Nabulsi family names are associated with Samaritan ancestry – Muslimani, Yaish, and Shakshir among others. According to the historian Fayyad Altif, large numbers of Samaritans converted due to persecution and because the monotheistic nature of Islam made it <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> accept it.|$|E
5|$|In March 2000, he {{left for}} Pakistan with Waleed and Ahmed al-Nami; later, {{they went on to}} Afghanistan. Wail al-Shehri {{followed}} the standard path for new al-Qaeda recruits in Afghanistan, spending time in the Khalden training camp and then Al Farouq training camp near Kandahar. Details on how the non-pilot ("muscle") hijackers were chosen for the September 11 attacks are vague, though the hijackers appear to have been selected by senior al-Qaeda leaders in 2000 from the thousands of recruits at training camps in Afghanistan. The most capable and motivated volunteers were at al-Farouq, and Saudi citizens were good candidates, since it would be <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> obtain visas to travel to the United States. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director George Tenet later said that the muscle hijackers were probably told little about their mission in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The poorer {{people were}} also {{alarmed by the}} {{contagion}} and some left the city, {{but it was not}} <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> abandon their accommodation and livelihoods for an uncertain future elsewhere. Before exiting through the city gates, they were required to possess a certificate of good health signed by the Lord Mayor and these became increasingly difficult to obtain. As time went by and the numbers of plague victims rose, people living in the villages outside London began to resent this exodus and were no longer prepared to accept townsfolk from London, with or without a certificate. The refugees were turned back, were not allowed to pass through towns and had to travel across country, and were forced to live rough on what they could steal or scavenge from the fields. Many died in wretched circumstances of starvation and thirst in the hot summer that was to follow.|$|E

25|$|Priests and {{candidates}} for the priesthood often live at a level both materially and educationally superior to that of their families {{and the members of}} their own age group. It is therefore very <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> succumb to the temptation of thinking of themselves as better than others. When this happens, the ideal of priestly service and self-giving dedication can fade, leaving the priest dissatisfied and disheartened.|$|E

25|$|Norwegians are {{accustomed}} to variation, and may perceive Danish and Swedish only as slightly more distant dialects. This is because they have two official written standards, {{in addition to the}} habit of strongly holding on to local dialects. The people of Stockholm, Sweden and Copenhagen, Denmark, have the greatest difficulty in understanding other Scandinavian languages. In the Faroe Islands and Iceland, learning Danish is mandatory. This causes Faroese people as well as Icelandic people to become bilingual in two very distinct North Germanic languages, making it relatively <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> understand the other two Mainland Scandinavian languages.|$|E
25|$|Transient (state) {{loneliness}} {{is temporary}} in nature, caused by {{something in the}} environment, and is easily relieved. Chronic (trait) loneliness is more permanent, caused by the person, and is not easily relieved. For example, {{when a person is}} sick and cannot socialize with friends would be a case of transient loneliness. Once the person got better it would be <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> alleviate their loneliness. A person who feels lonely regardless of if they are at a family gathering, with friends, or alone is experiencing chronic loneliness. It does not matter {{what goes on in the}} surrounding environment, the experience of loneliness is always there.|$|E
25|$|Responsible men {{can become}} more deeply {{convinced}} of {{the truth of the}} doctrine laid down by the Church on this issue if they reflect on the consequences of methods and plans for artificial birth control. Let them first consider how easily this course of action could open wide the way for marital infidelity and a general lowering of moral standards. Not much experience is needed to be fully aware of human weakness and to understand that human beings—and especially the young, who are so exposed to temptation—need incentives to keep the moral law, and it is an evil thing to make it <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> break that law. Another effect that gives cause for alarm is that a man who grows accustomed to the use of contraceptive methods may forget the reverence due to a woman, and, disregarding her physical and emotional equilibrium, reduce her to being a mere instrument for the satisfaction of his own desires, no longer considering her as his partner whom he should surround with care and affection.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a general}} rule, while ambling horses {{are able to}} canter, they usually are not known for speed, nor is it {{particularly}} <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> transition from an ambling gait into the canter or gallop. [...] Thus, in history, where comfort for long hours in the saddle was important, ambling horses were preferred for smoothness, sure-footedness and quiet disposition. [...] However, when speed and quick action was of greater importance, horses that trotted were more suitable due to their speed and agility. [...] When horses were used in warfare, particularly during the Middle Ages, {{it was not uncommon}} for a knight to ride an ambling horse to a battle site, then switch to a war horse for galloping into the actual battle.|$|E
2500|$|Hydrogenated {{vegetable}} oils differ in two major ways from other oils which are equally saturated. During hydrogenation, {{it is easier}} for hydrogen to come into contact with the fatty acids {{on the end of the}} triglyceride, and less <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> come into contact with the center fatty acid. This makes the resulting fat more brittle than a tropical oil; soy margarines are less [...] "spreadable" [...] The other difference is that trans fatty acids (often called trans fat) are formed in the hydrogenation reactor, and may amount to as much as 40 percent by weight of a partially hydrogenated oil. Hydrogenated oils, especially partially hydrogenated oils with their higher amounts of trans fatty acids are increasingly thought to be unhealthy.|$|E
2500|$|While {{awaiting}} sentencing, Madoff {{met with}} the SEC's Inspector General, H. David Kotz, who conducted an investigation into how regulators had failed to detect the fraud despite numerous red flags. Madoff said {{he could have been}} caught in 2003, but that bumbling investigators had acted like [...] "Lt. Colombo" [...] and never asked the right questions: I was astonished. They never even looked at my stock records. If investigators had checked with The Depository Trust Company, a central securities depository, it would've been <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> see. If you're looking at a Ponzi scheme, it's the first thing you do.

2500|$|In the High Court case of Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1989), the applicant's counsel {{argued that}} the Singapore courts should {{recognize}} the basic features doctrine and thereby limit the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution. The doctrine was rejected by Justice Frederick Arthur Chua. He noted that Article 5 of the Constitution does not place any limitations on Parliament's power to amend the Constitution, and concluded that if {{the framers of the}} Constitution had intended for such limitations to apply they would have expressly provided for them. Justice Chua also referred to the Malaysian case Phang Chin Hock, in which the Federal Court had rejected the basic features doctrine, stating that [...] "if our Constitution makers had intended that their successors should not in any way alter their handiwork, it would have been perfectly <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> so provide; but nowhere in the Constitution does it appear that that was their intention". Moreover, if proposed constitutional amendments are only valid if they are consistent with its existing provisions this would render Article 159 of the Malaysian Constitution, which provides for amendment of the Constitution, [...] "superfluous, for the Constitution cannot be changed or altered in any way, as if it has been carved in granite".|$|E
2500|$|In 2013 a {{class action}} lawsuit was filed against Facebook alleging the company scanned user {{messages}} for web links, translating them to “likes” on the user’s Facebook profile. Data lifted from the private messages was then used for targeted advertising, the plaintiffs claimed. [...] "Facebook's practice of scanning the content of these messages violates the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA {{also referred to as}} the Wiretap Act), as well as California's Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA), and section 17200 of California's Business and Professions Code," [...] the plaintiffs said. This shows that once information is online it is no longer completely private. [...] It is an increasing risk because younger people are having easier internet access than ever before, therefore they put themselves in a position where it is all too <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> upload information, but they may not have the caution to consider how difficult it can be to take that information down once it is out in the open. [...] This is becoming a bigger issue now that so much of society interacts online which was not the case fifteen years ago. [...] In addition, because of the quickly evolving digital media arena, people's interpretation of privacy is evolving as well, and {{it is important to consider}} that when interacting online. [...] New forms of social networking and digital media such as Instagram and Snapchat may call for new guidelines regarding privacy. [...] What makes this difficult is the wide range of opinions surrounding the topic, so it is left mainly up to our judgement to respect other people's online privacy in some circumstances. [...] Sometimes it may be necessary to take extra precautions in situations where somebody else may have a tighter view on privacy ethics. [...] No matter the situation it is beneficial to know about the potential consequences and issues that can come from careless activity on social networks.|$|E
