How much better if engines could be constructed whose moving parts have been eliminated! Solar cells, for the production of electricity, are one way to go: the result is an elegant 'engine' in which only the electrons are the moving parts. In a paper 1 in Physical Review Letters, Reid, Ward and Swift describe another, but less familiar, transition to engines without moving parts. Moreover, by using a single gas both as the working part of the engine and as a <b>heat-exchange</b> <b>medium,</b> an old theoretical efficiency limit can be transgressed...|$|E
