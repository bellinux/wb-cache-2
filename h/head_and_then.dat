5|$|Allen {{then set}} {{off with the}} other two boats in an attempt to seize the {{schooner}} which had helped Revenge crew escape. This second schooner maintained a heavy fire upon the advancing American boats, and Alligator cutter soon lagged behind as it had taken heavy casualties and had trouble manning its oars. Allen attempted to rally his men by standing up and waving them forward. In doing so Allen exposed himself and was struck by musket fire, taking a round first in the <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> in the chest. With their commander mortally wounded and their crew taking heavy casualties, the American boats withdrew, thus allowing the second pirate schooner as well as a third that had not been engaged, to escape. The vessels the pirates had seized were left behind and recovered by the Americans after the action had ended.|$|E
5|$|Although Tsukudani kept a {{notebook}} with story ideas, she admitted that {{on many occasions}} the theme of a chapter {{was born out of}} her own daydreams. Once she decided on a theme, she had the characters move around in her <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> worked out the plot and storyboard. Since she had a solid grasp on who the characters were, she noted that they moved around for her on their own. Conversely, if the characters were stiff with a given theme, Tsukudani could not develop an interesting story and moved on to another idea. The theme developed for the manga serialized in Febri had to do with bonus aspects to the story that she was unable to draw in the main serialization, as well as events that occurred between chapters in the main story.|$|E
5|$|The Joker forces Batman {{into a game}} of {{hide and}} seek, giving him one hour to escape Arkham before his adversaries are sent to hunt him down. Although Batman {{initially}} refuses, he accepts the challenge after the Joker shoots a prison guard in the <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> threatens to kill Adams. However, unbeknownst to Batman, the Joker shortens the time from one hour to ten minutes after being pressured by the other inmates. Batman subsequently encounters Clayface, Mad Hatter, the Scarecrow, and Maxie Zeus, among other villains. During a struggle with Killer Croc, Batman is thrown out of a window, grabbing onto the statue of the angel Michael. Clutching the statue's bronze spear, Batman climbs back inside and impales Croc before throwing him out the window, sustaining a severe wound from the spear in the process.|$|E

5|$|The NWA World Tag Team Championship was {{defended by}} AMW, who were {{accompanied}} by Gail Kim, against The Naturals in the sixth bout on the card. The duration of the contest was 10 minutes and 37 seconds. Douglas' head was busted open during the match, causing him to bleed from the forehead throughout. The Naturals got a two-count on Harris after they performed AMW's signature Death Sentence maneuver on him by slamming him back-first into the mat while jumping on his throat. Kim interfered in the bout by distracting The Naturals, which allowed Storm to bash Douglas over the <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> handcuff him to the ring-barrier. AMW followed by performing the Death Sentence on Stevens and pinning him to remain champions.|$|E
5|$|The final bout of {{the event}} was the main event match between Bam Bam Bigelow and Lawrence Taylor. Bigelow was {{accompanied}} {{by the members of}} DiBiase's Million Dollar Corporation: King Kong Bundy, Tatanka, Irwin R. Schyster, Kama, and Nikolai Volkoff. To prevent the Corporation members from interfering, Taylor brought several football players: Ken Norton Jr., Chris Spielman, Rickey Jackson, Carl Banks, Reggie White, and Steve McMichael. Taylor gained the advantage early and performed a clothesline that knocked Bigelow out of the ring. Once he returned to the ring, Bigelow took control of the match by kicking Taylor repeatedly and performing a Boston crab submission hold to hurt Taylor's back. Taylor got out of the hold and threw Bigelow with a suplex. Bigelow recovered and performed several headbutts on Taylor before executing a moonsault flip to knock Taylor down to the mat. Taylor began {{to take control of the}} match again, but Bigelow kicked him in the back of the <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> performed a headbutt from the top rope. Bigelow was unable to pin Taylor, however. Taylor climbed to the second rope, jumped off, and used his forearm to hit Bigelow. He then covered Bigelow to win the match.|$|E

At {{the beginning of the}} bout, Joe placed Kaz and Steiner in various holds and submission maneuvers.

Kaz then jumped off of a turnbuckle and dropkicked Steiner. Later, Joe dove through the second rope onto Steiner. However, Steiner countered by hitting Joe {{in the head with a}} steel pipe while the referee was distracted by Khan. Near the end of the match, Kaz tried to perform his signature Flux Capacitor maneuver on Steiner from a turnbuckle, but Steiner countered by pushing him off to the ringside area. Joe then kicked Steiner in the <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> performed his signature Muscle Buster maneuver, driving Steiner neck- and back-first into the mat, at fourteen minutes and thirty seconds to win the contest and retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

5|$|The reader {{progressively}} learns their history. Dobroselova originally {{lived in}} the country, but moved to St. Petersburg (which she hates) when her father lost his job. Her father becomes very violent and her mother severely depressed. Her father dies and they move in with Anna Fyodorovna, a landlady who was previously cruel to them but at least pretends to feel sympathy for their situation. Dobroselova is tutored by a poor student named Pokrovsky, whose drunken father occasionally visits. She eventually {{falls in love with}} Pokrovsky. She struggles to save a measly amount of money to purchase the complete works of Pushkin at the market for his birthday present, then allows his father to give the books to him instead, claiming that just knowing he received the books will be enough for her happiness. Pokrovsky falls ill soon after, and his dying wish is to see the sun and the world outside. Dobroselova obliges by opening the blinds to reveal grey clouds and dirty rain. In response Pokrovsky only shakes his <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> passes away. Dobroselova's mother dies shortly afterwards, and Dobroselova is left in the care of Anna for a time, but the abuse becomes too much and she goes to live with Fedora across the street.|$|E
5|$|Francisco Rafael was celebrating his 64th {{birthday}} {{along with}} his wife, children, and friends at Ocean House, a beachfront banquet hall owned by Hotel Marbella in Los Cabos, Baja California Sur on 18 October 2013. There were about 80 to 100 attendees at the party, including prominent businessmen, politicians, celebrities, and sport figures like former Mexican footballer Jared Borgetti and boxing champion Omar Chávez. The party also hosted a number of musical groups, including banda La Cabeña, El Mariachi de Los Cabos, and the former leading vocalist of Banda El Recodo. At around 8:00p.m. that day, a black-colored SUV entered the private property and parked near {{the entrance of the}} ballroom. In the front seats of the car, according to eye-witness reports, were two men; in the back seat was a man dressed as a clown, who descended from the vehicle and headed towards the door that led to the kitchen. Once inside the ballroom, the clown identified Francisco Rafael {{at the center of the}} room and began to walk towards him. When the clown was about 1m (3.3ft) close, he pulled out a pistol from his costume and shot him point-blank in his <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> several times more as he fell to the ground, killing him on the scene. As the former drug lord lay dead near the entrance, the assassin ran through a rear exit while the attendees yelled, fell to the ground, and hid under the tables. Four more shots were heard outside the ballroom shortly after the attack; according to eyewitnesses, the clown had done this to scare off one of Francisco Rafael's sons, who was chasing him. The suspect then fled the crime scene in the black-colored SUV and headed towards the highway.|$|E
