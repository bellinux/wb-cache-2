Under reasonable hypothesis on the [...] "initial" [...] data, the <b>eikonal</b> equation admits a local solution, but a global smooth solution (e.g. a solution for all time in the geometrical optics case) is not possible. The reason is that caustics may develop. In the geometrical optics case, this means that wavefronts cross.|$|E
50|$|The main {{advantage}} that the <b>eikonal</b> approximation offers {{is that the}} equations reduce to a differential equation in a single variable. This reduction into a single variable {{is the result of}} the straight line approximation or the <b>eikonal</b> approximation which allows us to choose the straight line as a special direction.|$|E

50|$|The <b>eikonal</b> {{equation}} (from German <b>Eikonal,</b> {{which is}} from Greek εἰκών, image) is a non-linear partial differential equation encountered in problems of wave propagation, when the wave equation is approximated using the WKB theory. It is derivable from Maxwell's equations of electromagnetics, {{and provides a}} link between physical (wave) optics and geometric (ray) optics.|$|E

50|$|The early steps {{involved}} in the <b>eikonal</b> approximation in quantum mechanics are very {{closely related to the}} WKB approximation for one-dimensional waves. The WKB method, like the <b>eikonal</b> approximation, reduces the equations into a differential equation in a single variable. But the difficulty with the WKB approximation is that this variable is described by the trajectory of the particle which, in general, is complicated.|$|E
50|$|One fast {{computational}} algorithm {{to approximate}} {{the solution to}} the <b>eikonal</b> equation is the fast marching method.|$|E

50|$|The fast {{sweeping}} {{method is}} an iterative method which uses upwind difference for discretization and uses Gauss-Seidel iterations with alternating sweeping ordering {{to solve the}} discretized <b>Eikonal</b> equation on a rectangular grid. The origins of this approach lie in control theory. Although fast sweeping methods have existed in control theory, it was first proposed for <b>Eikonal</b> equations by Hongkai Zhao, an applied mathematician at the University of California, Irvine.|$|E
50|$|In applied mathematics, {{the fast}} {{sweeping}} method is a numerical method for solving boundary value {{problems of the}} <b>Eikonal</b> equation.|$|E
5000|$|Sweeping {{algorithms}} {{are highly}} efficient for solving <b>Eikonal</b> equations when the corresponding characteristic curves {{do not change}} direction very often.|$|E

5000|$|If Ω is {{a subset}} of the Euclidean space Rn with {{piecewise}} smooth boundary, then the signed distance function is differentiable almost everywhere, and its gradient satisfies the <b>eikonal</b> equation ...|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{numerical}} methods to solve boundary value problems. For the <b>Eikonal</b> equation, {{due to the}} good behavior of the refraction index just a simple Shooting method can be used.|$|E
50|$|Anomalous {{diffraction}} theory (also van de Hulst approximation, <b>eikonal</b> approximation, {{high energy}} approximation, soft particle approximation) is an approximation developed by Dutch astronomer van de Hulst describing light scattering for optically soft spheres.|$|E
50|$|In {{theoretical}} physics, the <b>eikonal</b> approximation (Greek εἰκών for likeness, icon or image) is an approximative method {{useful in}} wave scattering equations which occur in optics, seismology, quantum mechanics, quantum electrodynamics, and partial wave expansion.|$|E
5000|$|Plugging {{the series}} into this equation, and equating powers of , the most {{singular}} term [...] satisfies the <b>eikonal</b> equation (in this case called a dispersion relation),To order , the leading-order amplitude must satisfy a transport equation ...|$|E
5000|$|This {{equation}} {{still does}} not [...] "unify" [...] quantum mechanics and general relativity, because the semiclassical <b>Eikonal</b> approximation {{in the context of}} quantum theory and general relativity has been applied, to provide a transition between these theories.|$|E
5000|$|We {{can solve}} the <b>eikonal</b> {{equation}} {{using the method}} of characteristics. One must impose the [...] "non-characteristic" [...] hypothesis [...] along the initial hypersurface , where H=H(x,p) and p=(p1,...,pn) is the variable that gets replaced by ∇u. Here x=(x1,...,xn) = (t,x').|$|E
50|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} May 2015, Peter Pilz, {{a member of}} the Austrian parliament for the Green Party, disclosed several documents and transcripts related to operation <b>Eikonal,</b> in which NSA and BND cooperated for tapping transit cables at a facility of Deutsche Telekom in Frankfurt. These documents were highly sensitive and handed over to the committee for investigating the <b>Eikonal</b> operation. Therefore, it seems likely someone from the committee leaked these documents to Pilz. Among them are lists of communication channels from many European countries, including most of Germany's neighbours. Peter Pilz also discovered NSA spying facilities in Austria, and therefore wants a parliamentary committee on the NSA spying in his own country too.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>eikonal</b> {{equation}} {{is one of}} the formThe plane [...] {{can be thought of as}} the initial condition, by thinking of [...] as [...] We could also solve the equation on a subset of this plane, or on a curved surface, with obvious modifications.|$|E
50|$|Vidale {{also contributed}} an {{improved}} method of ray tracing which {{relied on a}} finite-difference approximation of the <b>eikonal</b> equation and which has been used widely in both earthquake and reflection seismology. There have been some controversies surrounding his research, including endorsements of risky experiments, misquotes, and mild ridicule as well.|$|E
5000|$|The {{solution}} to the <b>eikonal</b> equationcan be interpreted as the minimal amount of time required to travel from [...] to , where [...] is the speed of travel, and [...] is an exit-time penalty. (Alternatively this can be posed as a minimal cost-to-exit by making the right-side [...] and [...] an exit-cost penalty.) ...|$|E
50|$|If {{the field}} has a {{constant}} value subtracted from it in time, the zero level (which was the initial boundary) of the new fields will also be circular and will similarly collapse to a point. This is due to this being effectively the temporal integration of the <b>Eikonal</b> equation with a fixed front velocity.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} fully nonlinear {{equation is}} the <b>eikonal</b> equation. This has the formso that the function F is given byThe dual cone consists of 1-forms a dx + b dy + c dz satisfyingTaken projectively, this defines a circle. The dual curve {{is also a}} circle, and so the Monge cone at each point is a proper cone.|$|E
50|$|For the <b>Eikonal</b> equation, this {{correction}} {{can be done}} by {{solving a}} boundary value problem. As the equation is of second order, the problem is well defined. In spite of the lack of a firm theoretical basis for the ITU method, a trial-error by dichotomy (or binary search) can also be used. The next figure shows the results of numerical simulations.|$|E
50|$|Information on Operation <b>Eikonal</b> {{was first}} {{unveiled}} by Süddeutsche Zeitung, Norddeutscher Rundfunk and Westdeutscher Rundfunk on October 3, 2014. Although some documents {{suggested that the}} operation had been completed in 2008, {{it was revealed that}} in December 2012, there were still transfers of 500 million metadata per month being made. Of these 500 million datasets, 180 million were captured using XKeyscore.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first two}} are only of 1st order {{approximation}} (see Orders of approximation). For the <b>eikonal</b> equation, many numerical schemes are available. Here only a simple second order scheme was chosen. For most standard configurations of source-target, the three methods differ little from each other. It {{is only in}} the case of rays grazing the ground that the differences are meaningful. The following was used for testing: ...|$|E
