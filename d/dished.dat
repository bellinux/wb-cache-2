5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} {{are manufactured}} with domed (convex) and <b>dished</b> (concave) bottoms. The <b>dished</b> profile {{allows them to}} stand upright on a horizontal surface, and is the standard shape for industrial cylinders. The cylinders used for emergency gas supply on diving bells are often this shape, and commonly have a water capacity of about 50 litres ("J"). Domed bottoms give a larger volume for the same cylinder mass, and are the standard for scuba cylinders up to 18 litres water capacity, though some concave bottomed cylinders have been marketed for scuba.|$|E

5|$|The {{draw for}} {{the third round of}} the FA Cup saw Manchester United take on cup holders Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in a repeat of the 1994 final.

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) {{are one of}} {{the most}} interesting nanomaterials because of their excellent characteristics.
