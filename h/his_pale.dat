5|$|<b>His</b> <b>pale,</b> heavy-boned face {{showed signs}} of sleeplessness. His strong body was bulging over {{the sides of the}} seat; his legs were spread wide over the pale, rose-colored velvet carpet. There was a little cup of black coffee, absurdly delicate, beside his gnarled work-warped hand.|$|E
25|$|It was the Spaniards {{who gave}} the world the notion that an aristocrat's blood is not red but blue. The Spanish nobility started taking shape around the ninth century in classic {{military}} fashion, occupying land as warriors on horseback. They were to continue the process {{for more than five}} hundred years, clawing back sections of the peninsula from its Moorish occupiers, and a nobleman demonstrated his pedigree by holding up his sword arm to display the filigree of blue-blooded veins beneath <b>his</b> <b>pale</b> skin—proof that his birth had not been contaminated by the dark-skinned enemy. Sangre azul, blue blood, was thus a euphemism for being a white man—Spain's own particular reminder that the refined footsteps of the aristocracy through history carry the rather less refined spoor of racism.|$|E
25|$|The {{choice of}} Sophia as wife of her second cousin, the {{prospective}} tsar Peter of Holstein-Gottorp, resulted from some amount of diplomatic management in which Count Lestocq, Peter's aunt (and ruling Russian Empress) Elizabeth and Frederick II of Prussia took part. Lestocq and Frederick wanted {{to strengthen the}} friendship between Prussia and Russia to weaken Austria's influence and ruin the Russian chancellor Bestuzhev, on whom Empress Elizabeth relied, and who acted as a known partisan of Russo-Austrian co-operation. Catherine first met Peter III {{at the age of}} 10. Based on her writings, she found Peter detestable upon meeting him. She disliked <b>his</b> <b>pale</b> complexion and his fondness for alcohol at such a young age. Peter also still played with toy soldiers. Catherine later wrote that she stayed {{at one end of the}} castle, and Peter at the other.|$|E
60|$|He seated {{himself by}} her side. <b>His</b> countenance was <b>pale,</b> <b>his</b> heart trembled.|$|R
60|$|Brandt hurried, looked out. <b>His</b> face <b>paled,</b> <b>his</b> {{lower jaw}} protruded, quivered, {{and then was}} shut hard. He walked away, put his foot on a bench and began to lace his leggings.|$|R
60|$|Johnny Sheehan {{began to}} cry. O'Brien listened anxiously. <b>His</b> face was <b>pale.</b> <b>His</b> lips trembled, {{and at times}} his whole body shook.|$|R
500|$|The Spectator, however, {{criticized the}} {{relationship}} of Presley's character with his love interests: [...] "The girls in his (Michael Curtiz's) latest film, King Creole, are both played by good, serious actresses: Carolyn Jones [...]. and Dolores Hart, ... both are shown to be hungrily, desperately, unpridefully {{in love with him}} (Presley's character). They have no existence, except in him; do nothing but wait for him; hope for nothing but a little rough affection ... Instead of being kissed, they beg for kisses, which Mr. Presley sulkily and reluctantly hands out now and then, with the air of a small, fastidious boy being press to eat marshmallow and, though he feels a bit sick not quite knowing {{how to get out of}} it ... (it) really seems to suggest this is a god come down among us for a spell; and when tender and infinitely patient in spite of the long past of infidelity, nonchalance, and what looks to an observer like plain indifference from him, her lips poised for the kiss that doesn't come ... As the most extreme example of a contemporary idol, Mr. Presley is pretty fascinating, and, though you may be put off at first by <b>his</b> <b>pale,</b> puffy, bruised looking babyish face, by the weary cherubic decadence you might imagine in Nero, and the excessive greasiness of his excessively long, spiky locks, his films, however bad (and King Creole is pretty low on his list), are well worth taking a look at." ...|$|E
2500|$|During his virtuoso heyday, Liszt was {{described}} by the writer Hans Christian Andersen as a [...] "slim young man... dark hair hung around <b>his</b> <b>pale</b> face". He was seen as handsome by many, with the German poet Heinrich Heine writing concerning his showmanship during concerts: [...] "How powerful, how shattering was his mere physical appearance".|$|E
2500|$|Albino is the alias of two Marvel Comics supervillains, Augusta Seger and Ulysses Counts. In Augusta Seger's backstory, he {{acquired}} the nickname [...] "Albino" [...] in school because of <b>his</b> <b>pale</b> skin, {{he grew up}} to become a criminal, and was recruited into the Power Men supervillain team and given a serum which allowed him to mimic others' superpowers. After Augusta was arrested, he accidentally transferred his powers to Ulysses Counts, his friend and old partner in crime, who gained the ability to phase through solid objects, used that power to escape from jail, and assumed the alias of Albino.|$|E

60|$|The boy {{was silent}} for some time. <b>His</b> face was <b>pale,</b> <b>his</b> eyes dark and furious. His mother moved about at her work, taking no notice of him.|$|R
2500|$|Roy Orbison was falsely {{said to be}} albinistic, by his widow, for unknown reasons. [...] German singer Heino has Graves disease, {{which can}} be mistaken for albinism. [...] Actor Anthony Rapp (of [...] ) fronts a rock band called Albinokid, but is not albinistic, being a {{normally}} pigmented, blonde Caucasian. [...] London mayor Boris Johnson, known for <b>his</b> <b>pale</b> hair, has also been mistakenly called albino. In general, platinum blonde ("towheaded") people with very pale skin can be mistaken for albinistic (and conversely, some forms of albinism can result in phenotypes so normal-looking that only genetic testing can reveal the albinistic genes).|$|E
2500|$|As {{in most of}} Italy, native vines are {{abundant}} in the land that the Ancient Greeks called Oenotrua (meaning [...] "land of vines") and was subsequently cultivated by the Romans. With its close proximity, France {{has been a significant}} viticultural influence on the region, particularly Burgundy, which is evident today in the varietal styles of most Piedmontese wines with very little blending. One of the earliest mention of Piedmontese wines occurred in the 14th century when the Italian agricultural writer Pietro de Crescentius wrote his Liber Ruralium Commodorum. He noted the efforts of the Piedmontese to make [...] "Greek style" [...] sweet wines by twisting the stems of the grapes clusters and letting them hang longer on the vine to dry out. He also noted the changes with trellising in the region with more vines being staked close to the grounds rather than cultivated high among trees in the manner more common to Italian viticulture at the time. In the 17th century, the court jeweller of Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy earned broad renown for <b>his</b> <b>pale</b> red Chiaretto made entirely from the Nebbiolo grape.|$|E
2500|$|Worse men {{had been}} less detested, but Danby had none of the amiable virtues which often {{counteract}} the odium incurred by serious faults. John Evelyn, who knew him intimately, described him as [...] "a man of excellent natural parts but nothing of generosity or gratefulness". The Earl of Shaftesbury, doubtless no friendly witness, spoke of him as an inveterate liar, [...] "proud, ambitious, revengeful, false, prodigal and covetous to the highest degree", and Burnet supported his unfavourable judgment. His corruption, his submission to a tyrannical wife, his greed, <b>his</b> <b>pale</b> face and lean person, which had replaced the handsome features and comeliness of earlier days, were the subject of ridicule, from the witty sneers of Halifax to the coarse jests of the anonymous writers of innumerable lampoons. By his championship of the national policy he raised up formidable foes abroad without securing a single friend or supporter at home, and his fidelity to the national interests was now, through an act of personal spite, to be the occasion of his downfall. Kenyon describes the Danby administration by the autumn of 1678 as [...] "weak, discredited, unpopular and unsuccessful"; it required only the Popish Plot to bring it down. Danby was accused of using the insane [...] "revelations" [...] of Israel Tonge for his own advantage; but as Kenyon notes, the King gave Danby an explicit order to investigate Tonge's claims, and whatever Danby's personal views, {{he had no choice}} but to comply.|$|E

60|$|He saw <b>his</b> cousin's <b>pale</b> face grow paler--he had used, {{without knowing}} it, Irene's own words.|$|R
60|$|<b>His</b> {{face was}} <b>pale,</b> <b>his</b> eyes dark, {{there was a}} faint spark of starlight on them. And he saw her face soft and upturned to him, very near. He kissed her softly.|$|R
60|$|His muscles tensed {{to drive}} home the blade, but {{something}} held his hand. <b>His</b> face <b>paled.</b> <b>His</b> shoulders contracted with a little shudder, and he turned toward {{the door of the}} apartment, almost running across the floor in his anxiety to escape. The eye in the dark maintained its unblinking vigilance.|$|R
