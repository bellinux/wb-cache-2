5|$|Priestley {{published}} {{the first volume}} of his projected history of experimental philosophy, The History and Present State of Discoveries Relating to Vision, Light and Colours (referred to as his Optics), in 1772. He paid careful attention to the history of optics and presented excellent explanations of early optics experiments, but his mathematical deficiencies caused him to dismiss several important contemporary theories. Furthermore, he did not include any of the practical sections that had made <b>his</b> <b>History</b> <b>of</b> Electricity so useful to practising natural philosophers. Unlike <b>his</b> <b>History</b> <b>of</b> Electricity, it was not popular and had only one edition, although it was the only English book on the topic for 150 years. The hastily written text sold poorly; the cost of researching, writing, and publishing the Optics convinced Priestley to abandon <b>his</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> experimental philosophy.|$|E

5|$|After {{a mental}} evaluation, a {{psychologist}} concluded Clemmons was competent {{to stand trial}} on the charges, which eliminated him {{as a candidate for}} involuntary commitment. An attorney for Clemmons notified the court he planned to pursue an insanity or diminished-capacity defense. On November 23, 2009, Clemmons paid $15,000 for a $190,000 bail bond from Jail Sucks Bail Bonds, a Chehalis-based company, to secure his release. Two other bail bond agencies had rejected Clemmons based on <b>his</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> failing to appear in court.|$|E
5|$|Also {{dating from}} this time is Beauchief Abbey, which was founded by Robert FitzRanulf de Alfreton. The abbey was {{dedicated}} to Saint Mary and Saint Thomas Becket, who had been canonised in 1172. Thomas Tanner, writing in 1695, stated that {{it was founded in}} 1183. Samuel Pegge in <b>his</b> <b>History</b> <b>of</b> Beauchief Abbey notes that Albinas, the abbot of Derby, {{who was one of the}} witnesses to the charter of foundation, died in 1176, placing foundation before that date.|$|E
5|$|As the {{libel suit}} against Marshall dragged on in Mercer County Circuit Court, Innes {{and his allies}} hired author William Littell to publish Innes' version of his {{interactions}} with Spain. Marshall countered by publishing <b>his</b> <b>History</b> <b>of</b> Kentucky in 1812. Although blatantly partisan, it became the most popular history of Kentucky at the time. When Street returned to Kentucky to give a deposition in the case in 1814, Innes swore out a writ against him to collect the damages awarded in his case against Street. Unable to pay, Street was imprisoned.|$|E

5|$|Historical {{parallelism}} and {{the tradition}} of drawing inspiration from the Middle Ages have become keystones of Islamic ideology.

In <b>his</b> <b>History</b> <b>of</b> the Crusades Sa'id Ashur emphasised the similarity between the modern and medieval situation facing Muslims and the need to study the Crusades in depth. Sayyid Qutb declared there was an international Crusader conspiracy. The ideas of Jihad and a long struggle have developed some currency.|$|E
5|$|In 1823, the Anti-Slavery Society {{was founded}} in Britain, {{dedicated}} to abolishing slavery throughout the British Empire; the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 represented the achievement of their goal. The Zong massacre was frequently cited in abolitionist literature in the 19th century; in 1839, Thomas Clarkson published <b>his</b> <b>History</b> <b>of</b> the Rise, Progress, and Accomplishment of the Abolition of the African Slave Trade, which included an account of killings.|$|E
5|$|In <b>his</b> <b>History</b> <b>of</b> Animals, Aristotle {{considered}} that the garden warbler eventually metamorphosed into a blackcap. The composer Olivier Messiaen used {{the song of}} the garden warbler as the basis for his 1971 solo piano piece La fauvette des jardins, the title being the French name of the species. His Turangalîla-Symphonie, a major work inspired by the legend of Tristan and Iseult, has a summer garden scene as its sixth movement.

5|$|Leonardo Bruni was {{the first}} to use {{tripartite}} periodization in <b>his</b> <b>History</b> <b>of</b> the Florentine People (1442). Bruni's first two periods were based on those of Petrarch, but he added a third period because he believed that Italy was no longer in a state of decline. Flavio Biondo used a similar framework in Decades of History from the Deterioration of the Roman Empire (1439–1453).|$|E

5|$|Senator Henry Wilson, {{founder of}} the unit, was well known during the war for his antislavery {{political}} stance.

In 1872, the same year he was elected Vice-President under Ulysses Grant, Wilson published the first volume of <b>his</b> <b>History</b> <b>of</b> the Rise and Fall of the Slave Power, a severe criticism of slave owners and their primary role, according to Wilson, in bringing about the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|The Crusades in the Holy Land are {{traditionally}} counted as nine distinct campaigns, numbered from the First Crusade of 1095–99 to the Ninth Crusade of 1271–72. This convention {{is used by}} Charles Mills in <b>his</b> <b>History</b> <b>of</b> the Crusades for the Recovery and Possession of the Holy Land (1820), and is often retained for convenience {{even though it is}} somewhat arbitrary. The Fifth and Sixth Crusades led by FrederickII may be considered a single campaign, as can the Eighth Crusade and Ninth Crusade led by LouisIX.|$|E

5|$|Although modern {{biology is}} a {{relatively}} recent development, sciences related to and included within it have been studied since ancient times. Natural philosophy was studied {{as early as the}} ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indian subcontinent, and China. However, the origins of modern biology and its approach to the study of nature are most often traced back to ancient Greece. While the formal study of medicine dates back to Hippocrates (ca. 460 BC – ca. 370 BC), it was Aristotle (384 BC – 322 BC) who contributed most extensively to the development of biology. Especially important are <b>his</b> <b>History</b> <b>of</b> Animals and other works where he showed naturalist leanings, and later more empirical works that focused on biological causation and the diversity of life. Aristotle's successor at the Lyceum, Theophrastus, wrote a series of books on botany that survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to the plant sciences, even into the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1786, Marshall had been implicating several {{prominent}} Kentucky politicians in {{a scheme to}} take Kentucky out of the Union and into alliance with Spain. After the expiration of his Senate term, he resumed these charges {{through the pages of}} the Western World newspaper. His allegations resulted in a legislative investigation of Kentucky Court of Appeals judge Benjamin Sebastian, who was found to be receiving a pension from Spain and resigned from the bench. Federal judge Harry Innes was also a target of Marshall's allegations, and the two became embroiled in a legal battle that lasted almost a decade. Innes hired William Littell to write and publish a book giving Innes' version of his dealings with Spain. Marshall countered by publishing <b>his</b> <b>History</b> <b>of</b> Kentucky in 1812. Although blatantly partisan, it became the most widely read history of the state at the time. Marshall and Innes ended their legal battle with an agreement, signed in 1815, that neither would publish anything negative about the other again. Innes upheld his part of the agreement, but in 1824, years after Innes' death, Marshall published an updated edition of <b>his</b> <b>History</b> <b>of</b> Kentucky which was just as vitriolic as the previous version had been. Marshall faded from public life during his later years. He died at the home of his son in Lexington, Kentucky on July 3, 1841.|$|E
5|$|Croitoru {{was also}} known for <b>his</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> legal problems. He {{was a member of}} Satan's Choice, a biker gang.

After a lengthy investigation, the charges were dropped in June 2006 because of insufficient evidence. He worked as a security guard in Vancouver, British Columbia, until being arrested in May 2009 for conspiracy to commit murder. On January 24, 2011, Croitoru was charged with first degree murder in connection with the 2008 killing of Jonathan Barber in Burnaby, British Columbia.|$|E
