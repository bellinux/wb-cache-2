40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{highlight}} the importance of modern telecommunications networks in combined transport marketing channels deployed for intermodal terminals. To develop a customer-based and broadly applicable framework for studying combined freight transport in Europe, {{the use of the}} marketing channel theory is advocated. The central research question addressed in this paper is: which opportunities do telecommunications networks offer to intermodal <b>freight</b> <b>terminals</b> in order to function more efficiently in combined transport marketing channels? After a description of the information sector and telecommunications networks, recent developments in these booming sectors are pinpointed and the opportunities offered to intermodal <b>freight</b> <b>terminals</b> and combined transport are mapped out. The central focus is on intermodal <b>freight</b> <b>terminals</b> in combined transport marketing channels in which different types of flows are employed (e. g. payment, ordering, promotion, etc.). All these marketing channel flows are, in principle, customer-driven and require a lot of tailor-made information and, thus, also the use of proper telecommunications networks. This paper describes the changing scene of intermodal <b>freight</b> <b>terminals</b> with a particular view to the opportunities-service change, service development, market development, diversification-for intermodal <b>freight</b> <b>terminals</b> to improve their competitive position by using the information and communication technology sector. The main message is that there are numerous opportunities for intermodal <b>freight</b> <b>terminals</b> to function more efficiently...|$|R

5|$|A Class 31 locomotive, number 31296, {{was named}} 'Amlwch Freighter'/'Trên Nwyddau Amlwch' in September 1986 at the Associated Octel plant.

The name was removed in March 1990 and transferred to the Class 47 locomotive 47330, which was renumbered 47390 for a period, retaining the name. This locomotive was later rebuilt as a Class 57, and renamed 'The Hood' by its new operator, Virgin Trains.|$|E

5|$|Andreas Hjelmeland {{established}} Førdefly in 1966 as {{the second}} airline based in Sogn og Fjordane. Førdefly never received a concession to operate scheduled services; instead it flew a daily charter flight to Bergen Airport. The airline established a water aerodrome at Øyrane {{at the mouth of}} the river Jølstra. The aerodrome had a passenger and <b>freight</b> <b>terminal,</b> a quay, a hangar and a control tower. The municipality received permission from the Ministry of Transport and Communications in mid 1970 to operate a municipal airport, and chose to use the terminal facilities operated by Førdefly. Construction of the runway cost 1.3 million Norwegian krone and the first aircraft landed on the strip on 14 July 1970. Scheduled services commenced on 1 July 1971, the same day as Florø Airport, Sogndal Airport, Haukåsen and Ørsta-Volda Airport, Hovden opened.|$|E
5|$|While the {{original}} {{plans for the}} Dovre Line involved completion in 1916, {{it was not until}} 1921 the first train could travel from Oslo to Trondheim via Dovre, mostly due to the First World War. The new depot opened in 1916, and in 1917 the double track and dual gauge to Marienborg as well as the new <b>freight</b> <b>terminal</b> was finished. Instead of using one track for each direction on the double track, the Dovre Line would use the one line while the other would be used for transport from the station to the depot. Skansen Bridge opened on 22 March 1918. In 1922, Norsk Spisevognselskap established a kiosk, and on 1 October 1925, they took over the station restaurant.|$|E
5|$|By 2005, {{ridership}} {{had increased}} to 2.5 million per year, up 278% from 1991, giving a 7% {{market share in}} the corridor. To further increase capacity and regularity, the Norwegian National Rail Administration decided to rebuild the section from Stavanger to Sandnes to double track. At the same time, a new <b>freight</b> <b>terminal</b> was to be built at Ganddal, meaning that the section would only have to be shared with intercity trains. The upgrade involved closing Hillevåg Station, and building three new stations: Paradis, Jåttåvågen and Gausel. Construction was started in 2006 and {{was estimated to be}} completed by 2009. It was estimated to cost 2.2 billion Norwegian krone. From April to November 2009, the section from Ganddal to Stavanger was closed while {{the last part of the}} upgrade was completed. The new line was opened on 16 November 2009 and from 14 December, the 15-minute headway was introduced between Stavanger and Sandnes.|$|E

5|$|Plans for {{the club}} {{to move to a}} new groundMaine Roadin Moss Side were {{announced}} in 1922. The final Manchester City match at Hyde Road was a league fixture against Newcastle United on 28 April 1923, and in August 1923 a public practice game was the last football match played at Hyde Road. Manchester City began the 192324 season at Maine Road, which had an 80,000 capacity. Parts of Hyde Road were used elsewhere; the roof of the Main Stand was sold to Halifax Town, and erected at The Shay, where even in the 21st century, part of the Hyde Road roof is still in place. Within a decade, all traces of the football ground had disappeared from Hyde Road. The bulk of the area was taken over by Manchester Corporation Tramways department, whose major Hyde Road depot and works was alongside, for use as their Permanent Way yard for assembling and storing tramway rails and materials. The Tramways system also provided at this time a substantial parcels handling service within the city, using both vans and special parcels trams, and a new central parcels depot was built on the Bennett Street side of the former site, against the railway viaduct. After the end of Manchester's trams in 1949 (most of the old trams were scrapped on this site) it was used for storing old buses and as a bus drivers' training area. As of 2000, the site of the pitch is Olympic <b>Freight</b> <b>Terminal,</b> a container storage and warehousing facility.|$|E

From {{the time when the}} Sydney Railway Company was formed in 1848, it had been the intention of the company to build a <b>freight</b> <b>terminal</b> at Darling Harbour. To this end, a railway line was constructed between the Sydney Railway Station (the predecessor to Central railway station) and Darling Harbour, which opened on 26 September 1855. This line was extended to Dulwich Hill via Lilyfield in 1922. A short branch from Lilyfield to Rozelle served another <b>freight</b> <b>terminal.</b>|$|E
