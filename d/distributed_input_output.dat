40|$|The Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS) {{has been}} widely adopted in the {{accelerator}} community. Although EPICS is available on many platforms, the majority of implementations have used UNIX workstations as clients, and VME- or VXI-based processors for <b>distributed</b> <b>input</b> <b>output</b> controllers. Recently, {{a significant portion of}} EPICS has been ported to personal computer (PC) hardware platforms running Microsoft`s operating systems, and also Wind River System`s real time vxWorks operating system. This development should significantly reduce the cost of deploying EPICS systems, and the prospect of using EPICS together with the many high quality commercial components available for PC platforms is also encouraging. A hybrid system using both PC and traditional platforms is currently being implemented at LANL for LEDA, the low energy demonstration accelerator under construction as part of the Accelerator Production of Tritium (APT) project. To illustrate these developments the authors compare their recent experience deploying a PC-based EPICS system with experience deploying similar systems based on traditional (UNIX-hosted) EPICS hardware and software platforms...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the issues, requirements, and methodologies for achieving single system image at multiple levels of abstractions necessary {{for ease of}} management and programming. Following that is the central issue of managing <b>distributed</b> <b>input</b> <b>output</b> including secondary storage and the challenges faced by the sometimes-conflicting requirements of generality, robustness, and performance. The challenge to achieving high availability for large and complex systems is considered in the next paper that examines the hardware and software means of improving system reliability. The succeeding next two chapters explore the realm of computation on commodity clusters {{from the perspective of}} shared numerical libraries and example applications. These papers provide quantitative evidence of the effectiveness and power of the cluster approach while exposing the challenges to extracting their best performance. This special issue concludes with a particularly interesting domain of application that while special purpose has extremely wide usage nonetheless. Embedded computing represents an installed base more than an order of magnitude greater than all desktop and server systems combined and the role of cluster computing in this arena is only now being explored for commercial, industrial, and defense related applications. This last paper provides an introduction to a range of embedded applications and the enabling hardware and software technologies that are making cluster computing available to support their growing performance and availability requirements. This special issue is offered as a contribution to a rapidly growing field that is likely to dominate high performance computing in the near future...|$|E

40|$|Linear {{analysis}} and Monte Carlo simulation are two wellestablished methods for statistical tolerance analysis of mechanical assemblies. Both methods have advantages and disadvantages. The Linearized Method, {{a form of}} linear analysis, provides fast analysis, tolerance allocation, and the capability to solve closed loop constraints. However, the Linearized Method does not accurately approximate nonlinear geometric effects or allow for non-normally <b>distributed</b> <b>input</b> or <b>output</b> distributions. Monte Carlo simulation, on the other hand, does accurately model nonlinear effects and allow for nonnormally <b>distributed</b> <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> distributions. Of course, Monte Carlo simulation can be computationally expensive and must be re-run when any input variable is modified. The second-order tolerance analysis (SOTA) method attempts to combine {{the advantages of the}} Linearized Method with the advantages of Monte Carlo simulation. The SOTA method applies the Method of System Moments to implicit variables of a system of nonlinear equations. The SOTA method achieves the benefits of speed, tolerance allocation, closed-loop constraints, non-linear geometric effects and non-normal <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> distributions. The SOTA method offers significant benefits as a nonlinear analysis tool suitable for use in design iteration. A comparison was performed between the Linearized Method, Monte Carlo simulation, and the SOTA method. The SOTA method provided a comparable nonlinear analysis to Monte Carlo simulation with 10 6 samples. The analysis time of the SOTA method was comparable to the Linearized Method. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{investigation}} {{of this paper}} is related to the design of active real-time con-trols which provide the desired performance of flexible constructions subjected to varying disturbances. Physical controllers are piezoelectric elements that transform applied voltages into mechanical forces and moments. Control voltages are computed on the base of signals measured on piezoelectric sensors. The underlying structure is a thin plate or shell. The piezo-electric elements are either surface mounted or embedded within the structure. Conventional averaging procedures are used to eliminate the thickness in mathematical models. A homog-enization procedure is used to reduce structures with large number of piezoelectric elements to the case of continuously <b>distributed</b> <b>input</b> or <b>output</b> signals. 1 CONCEPTION OF ACTIVE CONTROL The idea of active real-time control is intensively developed during several last years.

Furthermore, in the edge region of a cell, both the system capacity and symbol error probability (SER) are significantly improved due to the antenna cluster selection process.

Thus in this paper we study the ergodic capacity, for the single-user case, and the respective capacity increase by the user connection to K new antennas, over a Rayleigh flat fading channel. For each case we provide an exact closed-form expression and simple to compute upper/lower bounds. Results show that symmetry in the antenna configuration is good since maintains the capacity increase curve approximately flat. They also show that the maximum capacity increase by the connection to K new antennas is obtained when we have all mean SNR’s equal, which happens when all antennas are co-located, and not distributed...|$|R
40|$|Spatial {{analysis}} with preamplifier arrays and computers offers fresh perspectives on brain function. Realization {{of its potential}} depends on development of appropriate procedures for data processing and display, experimental paradigms to serve as benchmarks, and theories of brain function to predict {{what to look for}} and how to distinguish valid results from artifacts. Measurement of EEGs from arrays of 64 electrodes chronically implanted on the olfactory bulbs of rabbits that are trained to discriminate odorant conditioned stimuli show that the odorants induce spatially distinctive amplitude patterns of neural activity. The odor-specific information density is inferred to be uniform over the whole main bulb. The neural dynamics that produce these activity patterns emerge from the synaptically interactive sheet of excitatory mitral and inhibitory granule cells with <b>distributed</b> <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> tracts and with static non-linearities deriving from the nerve impulse mechanism. Excitatory synapses between mitral cells are subject to modification when odorants are paired with unconditioned stimuli, thus forming nerve cell assemblies. Odorant-specific information established by a stimulus locally in the bulbar unit activity is integrated with past experience by an assembly, disseminated over the entire bulb on the order of 100 mm 2 in area in a time period of 2. 5 ms, and sustained for a time period on the order of 0. 1 s. An arbitrary spatial sample on the order of 20 % of bulbar EEG activity captures the entire integrated information albeit at lesser resolution than the whole.

40|$|Smell is an underused {{sense in}} human-computer {{interaction}} (HCI). In our daily lives, smell tells us whether food {{is safe to}} eat, if a fire is breaking {{out in the next}} room, and, as evidence increasingly shows, if we find a potential mate attractive [8]. In HCI, however, smell is an almost entirely unexplored medium. There are reasons for this: technical difficulties in emitting scent on demand, chemical difficulties in creating accurate and pleasant scents, and issues of research focus and direction. However, it is now possible to purchase off-theshelf, easily controllable hardware for aroma output, and incorporating scent into HCI is now comparatively simple. The vast majority of work in HCI involves our senses of sight and hearing, with occasional forays into touch. Much of HCI has assumed a single user at his desk with a single screen, controlled by a single keyboard and mouse. The vision of ubiquitous computational power has led to a corresponding emergence of ambient and calm media: efforts exploring <b>distributed</b> <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> for <b>distributed</b> computing. Scent is an excellent medium for ambient or calm display; a scent can “move easily from the periphery of our attention, to the center, and back ” [18].

In [10], we, {{the authors of this}} paper, combined a typical decision-directed iterative ICI cancelation scheme to FADAC-OFDM. We achieved better performance compared with [5] even with low complexity due to better initial detection performance of FADAC-OFDM compared to the conventional Alamouti-coded OFDM. This scheme uses all the detected symbols in the interference reconstruction step without any consideration of reliability of detection symbols. However, even in FADAC-OFDM, some of the detection symbols may eventually have relatively high possibility of errors due to severe ICI terms such as inter-block ICI as mentioned before. It is shown that after the first iteration, the performance fairly improves, but from the second iteration, the performance is stuck in the same value. This is because the reconstructed interference term for cancelation is not updated anymore due to the erroneous portion of the constructed interference. Consequently, the performance gap between this scheme [10] and the case of no ICI is still considerable.|$|R
