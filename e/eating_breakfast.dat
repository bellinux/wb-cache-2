5|$|Since Mayor Senkichi Awaya {{had been}} killed while <b>eating</b> <b>breakfast</b> with his son and granddaughter at the mayoral residence, Field Marshal Hata, who was only {{slightly}} wounded, took over {{the administration of the}} city, and coordinated relief efforts. Many of his staff {{had been killed}} or fatally wounded, including a Korean prince of the Joseon Dynasty, Yi Wu, who was serving as a lieutenant colonel in the Japanese Army. Hata's senior surviving staff officer was the wounded Colonel Kumao Imoto, who acted as his chief of staff. Soldiers from the undamaged Hiroshima Ujina Harbor used suicide boats, intended to repel the American invasion, to collect the wounded and take them down the rivers to the military hospital at Ujina. Trucks and trains brought in relief supplies and evacuated survivors from the city.|$|E
5|$|One of Smith's {{significant}} contributions to the menu was {{the addition of a}} breakfast product line as part of the 1978 product line expansion. Up until that point, breakfast was not a market Burger King had served. Other than the addition of the Croissan'Wich in 1983, the breakfast menu remained almost identical to the McDonald's offerings until a menu revamp in 1986. This expansion introduced BK's A.M. Express product line, which included French toast sticks and mini-muffins. The new breakfast line was designed to be portable, because studies had shown that an increasing percent of consumers were <b>eating</b> <b>breakfast</b> on the go. Shortly after the introduction of the French toast stick products, BK partnered with Lender's Bagels to introduce a bagel breakfast sandwich. The new product was designed to drive sales in the morning by piquing customer's curiosity with a new taste. The product was tested for several months in BK's original home territory of Miami before a national roll-out.|$|E

25|$|On April 3, 1882, after <b>eating</b> <b>breakfast,</b> the Fords and Jameses {{went into}} the living room before {{traveling}} to Platte City for a robbery. From the newspaper, James had just learned that gang member Dick Liddil had confessed to participating in Wood Hite's murder. He was suspicious that the Fords had not told him about it. Robert Ford later said he believed that James had realized they were there to betray him. Instead of confronting them, James walked across the living room and laid his revolvers on a sofa. He turned around and noticed a dusty picture above the mantle, and stood on a chair to clean it. Robert Ford drew his weapon, and shot the unarmed Jesse James {{in the back of the}} head.|$|E

25|$|Cooke {{also participated}} in the Gettysburg Campaign with Stuart. Soon {{after the start of}} the Stuart's ride around the Union Army of the Potomac, Cooke was nearly shot or {{captured}} during the Battle of Fairfax Court House (June 1863). He was <b>eating</b> <b>breakfast</b> with two other staff officers and a courier at the home of a blacksmith while the blacksmith shoed their horses. The Confederate officers were about a half mile from the main body of Brig. Gen. Wade Hampton III's cavalry division when advance riders from the 11th Regiment New York Volunteer Cavalry rode by in pursuit of the advance guard of Hampton's division. The other three Confederates quickly fled toward their main body but Cooke was intent on finishing his breakfast and having his horse shoed. He barely escaped when a second group of Union riders became suspicious of the nature of activity at the farm and rode up to check.|$|E
25|$|Knowing that Murfreesboro and the {{surrounding}} area were staunchly pro-Southern in sentiment, Bragg felt compelled to make a stand on relatively flat ground north of the city, even though several more-defensible areas lay further to the north and south. The Federal Army of the Cumberland, now under the command of Major General William S. Rosecrans, closed with Bragg in late December 1862, arriving at Murfreesboro on December 29 and moving into position the following day. Following a musical contest between Southern and Federal bands during the evening hours on the 30th, both armies prepared to attack each other at dawn on the 31st. Incredibly, Bragg and Rosecrans had each made plans to assault each other's right flank, at almost the same moment. Hardee's corpsmore than 10,000 troops in all would attack at dawn in a massive wave, hoping to catch their enemy off guard and preoccupied with <b>eating</b> <b>breakfast</b> and other morning activities, just as they had done at Shiloh where they had achieved complete surprise. A ration of whiskey was issued to the troops at 8:00pm; soon afterwards they bedded down for the night, sleeping on cornstalks {{in an effort to keep}} off the soggy ground.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 7 December, Maryland was moored along Ford Island, with Oklahoma to port, {{connected}} by lines and a gangway.

Many of Marylands crew were preparing for shore leave at 09:00 or <b>eating</b> <b>breakfast</b> when the Japanese attack began. As the first Japanese aircraft appeared and explosions rocked the outboard battleships, Maryland 's bugler blew general quarters.|$|E

That whole first week I was there we worked on the 'Woods' song, which is called 'Lost in the World'.

500|$|The final track, [...] "Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast", {{is divided}} into three segments, each with its own {{descriptive}} title, joined by dialogue and sound effects of then-roadie Alan Styles preparing, discussing, and <b>eating</b> <b>breakfast.</b> The idea for the piece came about by Waters experimenting with the rhythm of a dripping tap, which combined sound effects and dialogue recorded by Mason in his kitchen with musical pieces recorded at Abbey Road. A slightly re-worked version was performed on stage on 22 December 1970 at Sheffield City Hall, Sheffield, England with the band members pausing between pieces to eat and drink their breakfast. The original LP ends with the sound of the tap which continues into the inner groove, and thus plays on indefinitely.|$|E
500|$|The Canadian and Australian {{forces in}} the centre {{advanced}} quickly, pushing the line [...] forward from its starting point by 11:00am. The speed of their advance was such that a party of German officers and some divisional staff were captured while <b>eating</b> <b>breakfast.</b> A gap [...] long was punched in the German line south of the Somme {{by the end of}} the day. There was less success north of the river, where the British III Corps had only a single tank battalion in support, the terrain was rougher and the German incursion of 6 August had disrupted some of the preparations. Although the attackers gained their first objectives, they were held up short of the Chipilly Spur, a steep wooded ridge.|$|E

500|$|In 1963, {{the comedy}} picture Who's Been Sleeping in My Bed?, {{starring}} Dean Martin, Elizabeth Montgomery, Jill St. John and Carol Burnett, {{was shot at}} the hotel. In the 1970s, John Lennon and Yoko Ono hid out {{in one of the}} bungalows for a week. Richard M. Nixon's chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, and presidential aide John Ehrlichman were <b>eating</b> <b>breakfast</b> in the Polo Lounge when they were informed of the Watergate [...] in 1972. In January, 1976, Peter Finch died of a sudden heart attack while sitting in the hotel lobby. Two months later, he was posthumously awarded the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as Howard Beale in the film Network. His co-star Faye Dunaway stayed at the hotel after winning the Academy Award for Best Actress for the same film; in one memorable photograph she was seated by the hotel pool lounging back in a chair surrounded by newspapers and her Oscar trophy. The exterior of the hotel was featured on the album cover art of The Eagles's [...] LP [...] "Hotel California" [...] that same year. Two years later, [...] California Suite was filmed at the hotel.|$|E
500|$|Perry {{announced}} [...] "Roar" [...] {{would be}} the first single from Prism with the release of a video teaser featuring the singer burning a blue wig. More video teasers were released onto YouTube, that showed Perry at a funeral with a coffin decorated with the singer's famous pink and white pinwheels dress, and entering a recording booth while dressed with a [...] "throwback" [...] jacket featured in the single's cover art, which was revealed on August 8, 2013. It features a tiger print border around Perry, who wears a blue Japanese silk sukajan jacket, with the image of a tiger printed on its back. On the same day of the song's digital release, a lyric video for it, produced by Joe Humpay, Aya Tanimura, Tim Zimmer, and Tuan Le, was released onto YouTube. It primarily shows Perry doing daily activities such as <b>eating</b> <b>breakfast,</b> going to the bathroom, and taking a bath, while texting the lyrics of [...] "Roar" [...] to friends. Some words are substituted with various Emoji characters. It was target of plagiarism accusations by music producer Dillon Francis, who felt it copied the concept of instant messaging from his video entitled [...] "Messages".|$|E
500|$|... "Friday" [...] {{uses the}} 50s {{progression}}, an I-VI-IV-V chord progression that many popular songs have used such as [...] "Heart and Soul" [...] and [...] "Unchained Melody". It is {{performed in the}} key of B major at a tempo of 112 beats per minute. According to Randy Lewis of Los Angeles Times, the familiar structure contributes to the song's catchiness, making it what others have called an earworm. The song also sees Black on a harmony track. In a review for Rolling Stone, writer Matthew Perpetua described the vocals as having [...] "a peculiar tonality that inadvertently highlights the absurdity of boilerplate pop lyrics," [...] adding that the tone in the refrain [...] "sounds unlike anything else in pop music." [...] He noted the sound as being not entirely agreeable to listen to, but stated that Black ultimately ends up [...] "sounding like a distinct singer with an alluring sort of anti-charisma." [...] The lyrics of the song speak about [...] "hanging out with friends and having fun." [...] Paul Asay of Plugged In noted that lyrics reflect the happenings of a day, {{in the life of}} a teenager like Black, like <b>eating</b> <b>breakfast</b> and going to school. [...] "She's excited 'cause it's Friday. Which means a weekend full of possibility awaits," [...] he concluded.|$|E
