25|$|In particular, it is {{commonly}} used to refer to the coil of wire that moves the read–write heads in a moving-head disk drive. In this application, a very lightweight coil of wires is mounted within a strong magnetic field produced by permanent rare-earth magnets. The voice coil is the motor part of the servo system that positions the heads: an <b>electric</b> <b>control</b> signal drives the voice coil and the resulting force quickly and accurately positions the heads.|$|E
2500|$|In North America, Westinghouse Air Brake {{supplied}} High Speed Control {{brake equipment}} for several post-World War II streamlined passenger trains. [...] This was an electrically controlled overlay on conventional D-22 passenger and 24-RL locomotive brake equipment. [...] On the conventional side, {{the control valve}} set a reference pressure in a volume, which set brake cylinder pressure via a relay valve. On the electric side, pressure from a second straight-air trainline controlled the relay valve via a two-way check valve. This [...] "straight air" [...] trainline was charged (from reservoirs on each car) and released by magnet valves on each car, controlled electrically by a 3 wire trainline, in turn controlled by an [...] "electro-pneumatic master controller" [...] in the controlling locomotive. This controller compared the pressure in the straight air trainline with that supplied by a self lapping portion of the engineers valve, signaling all of the [...] "apply" [...] or [...] "release" [...] magnets valves in the train to open simultaneously, changing the pressure in the [...] "straight air" [...] trainline much more rapidly and evenly than possible by simply supplying air directly from the locomotive. The relay valve was equipped with four diaphragms, magnet valves, <b>electric</b> <b>control</b> equipment, and an axle-mounted speed sensor, so that at speeds over [...] full braking force was applied, and reduced in steps at [...] , bringing the train to a gentle stop. [...] Each axle was also equipped with anti-lock brake equipment. [...] The combination minimized braking distances, allowing more full-speed running between stops. The [...] "straight air" [...] (electro-pneumatic trainline), [...] anti-lock, and speed graduating portions of the system were not dependent on each other in any way, and {{any or all of}} these options could be supplied separately.|$|E

50|$|With such {{a number}} of trams in service, {{it should come as}} no {{surprise}} that {{a number of}} detail variations occurred in the fleet, only the main variations are listed here. In 1929, cars 274 and 275 were fitted with additional air brake pipes for use in hauling the horse transport cars between the City and Morphettville Racecourse on the Glenelg line. These airpipes were later removed, most possibly after the suspension of the horse transport service in 1936. As originally built, all the drop centre trams were built with General Electric PC5L2 and later PC5K2 control equipment (except for nos 251 - 261 which had English <b>Electric</b> <b>control</b> equipment). However, in 1952-1953, cars 259, 260 and 261 had their English <b>Electric</b> <b>control</b> gear replaced with General <b>Electric</b> <b>control</b> gear. At the same time, 251 - 258 and 264 had English Electric controllers of a different type fitted. The original control gear from 264 ended up in the solitary H1 car, 381.|$|E
