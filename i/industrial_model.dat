25|$|Started in 1866 the {{development}} {{was built for}} the industrialist, politician and philanthropist Henry William Ripley. It {{was intended as a}} commercial development of model houses but when completed in 1881 had many aspects of an <b>industrial</b> <b>model</b> village – although residency was not limited to Ripley's employees. It was the only model village in the Borough of Bradford and can be compared with Akroydon in Halifax, built by Ripley's friend and schoolmate Edward Akroyd, Saltaire and model housing schemes in other West Riding textile towns.|$|E

Like Salt he was a councillor, JP and Bradford MP who was deeply concerned to improve working class housing conditions. He built the <b>industrial</b> <b>Model</b> village of Ripley Ville on a site in Broomfields, East Bowling close to the dye works.|$|E

The Russian language was mandated and russification of the Nivkh accelerated. Many Nivkh stories, beliefs, and clan ties were forgotten by new generations. From 1945 to 1948, many Nivkh, as well as half of the Oroks and all of the Sakhalin Ainu, who had been living under Japanese jurisdiction in the southern half of Sakhalin, were forced to move to Japan along with the ethnic Japanese settlers.

2500|$|In the 1880s Atlanta editor Henry W. Grady won {{attention}} in the state for his vision of a [...] "New South", a South based on the modern <b>industrial</b> <b>model.</b> By now, the idea had already struck some enterprising South Carolinians that the cotton they were shipping north could also be processed in South Carolina mills. The idea was not new; in 1854, De Bow's Commercial Review of the South & West had boasted to investors of South Carolina's potential for manufacturing, citing its three lines of railroads, inexpensive raw materials, non-freezing rivers, and labor pool. Slavery was so profitable before 1860 that it absorbed available capital and repelled Northern investors, but now the time for industrialization was at hand. By 1900, the textile industry was established in upland areas, which had water-power and an available white labor force, comprising men, women, and children willing to move from hard-scrabble farms to mill towns.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In industry, many {{business}} processes are modelled {{and stored in}} Enterprise Information Systems (EIS). Tools supporting the verification and validation of business processes can help {{to improve the quality}} of these business processes. However, existing tools can not directly be applied to models used in industry. In this paper, we present our approach for model verification and validation: translating <b>industrial</b> <b>models</b> to Petri nets and mCRL 2, and subsequently applying existing tools on the models derived from the initial <b>industrial</b> <b>models.</b> The following translations are described: BPMN models to Petri nets and Petri nets to mCRL 2.
