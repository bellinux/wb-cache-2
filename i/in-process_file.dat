All files and their associated metadata are indexed in the SQL base data management system and are searchable from the Vault client interface. Other information about the files include version history, uses (composed of a list of children), [...] "Where Used" [...] (a list of all parents) {{as well as a}} light weight viewable {{in the form of the}} Autodesk Design Web Format (DWF) file which is automatically published upon check-in. When users intend to edit a file the file is checked-out and edits are made. When the user is satisfied with the changes the file checked-in and new file version, containing the new changes, is then available to other users in the workgroup. <b>In-process</b> <b>file</b> changes (file saves) are hidden from other users until the changes are checked-in. As files are edited, renamed and moved in the folder structure the Vault database automatically updates any file references in related files.|$|E

The basic design concept is for an integrated file system in which a single machine-held record is created and maintained for each bibliographic item. Item records are variously processed for such products as acquisitions purchase orders, fiscal reports, catalog card sets, charge cards, and pocket labels. The system is built around an on-line master <b>in-process</b> <b>file</b> to which records and data can be variously entered as needed for ordering, order record update, cataloging, etc. At any time the master file contains records in many stages of completion; its current size is over 40, 000 records. Altogether more than 100, 000 complete machinereadable bibliographic records have been created through the system. These are stored in a historical file on magnetic tape, to which master file records are transferred when their processing is completed. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|E
