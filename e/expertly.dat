5|$|Many {{caves in}} the Mendip area were {{excavated}} for archaeological and natural history studies by pioneer explorer Herbert E. Balch and were <b>expertly</b> photographed by caver Harry Savory {{early in the}} 20th century using huge cameras, glass plates and flash powder.|$|E
5|$|The {{application}} of gold on the shields, {{in contrast to}} its absence {{on the rest of}} the ceiling, serves to link the ceiling to some extent with the frescoes around the walls. In the latter, gold leaf has been applied lavishly to many details and in some of the frescoes, notably those by Perugino, has been most <b>expertly</b> used not just to detail the robes but to highlight the folds by subtle graduation in the density of golden flecks. It is this technique that Michelangelo has picked up on and carried a step further, inspired also perhaps by the medallions that appear on a Roman triumphal arch in Botticelli's episode from the Life of Moses, showing the Punishment of the Rebels.|$|E
5|$|After his training, Rane {{was posted}} to the 28th Field Company, an {{engineering}} {{unit of the}} 26th Infantry Division which, at the time, was fighting the Japanese in Burma. As his division retreated from the Japanese after the failed Arakan Campaign, he, along with his two sections, was hand-picked by his company commander to stay back behind at Buthidaung to destroy key assets and then be evacuated by the Royal Indian Navy. Though the objective was soon achieved, the expected pickup did not happen. This forced Rane and his men to cross a river that was patrolled by the Japanese to reach their lines. Rane, along with his two sections, <b>expertly</b> evaded the Japanese troops, and joined the 26th Infantry Division at Bahri. For his actions, {{he was promoted to}} havaldar (sergeant).|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the book led to offers of work from The Sunday Times—for which she was paid an advance of 60 guineas—Go, a travel {{magazine}} owned by the newspaper, and Wine and Food, {{the journal of the}} Wine and Food Society. In August 1950 David and her husband went on their final holiday together with the money from the new contracts, although they had trouble with the car they were using for touring and the holiday was unsuccessful. On her return she invited Felicité, her youngest sister, to move into the top flat in her house. David was a reluctant and unskilful typist—she preferred the feel of writing with a pen—and in exchange for a low rent, Felicité <b>expertly</b> typed her articles and books, and later acted as her principal researcher.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} the year, Harry and Dumbledore {{journey to}} a cave to {{retrieve}} a suspected Horcrux, Slytherin's locket. Dumbledore <b>expertly</b> finds a secret passageway to a large, pitch black underground lake, which Harry and Dumbledore cross in a small boat to an island in the centre. The locket is {{at the bottom of a}} basin and can only be reached by drinking the potion above it. Harry helps Dumbledore, who drinks the potion, and though Dumbledore is severely weakened, together they manage to fight off Voldemort's Inferi that have been hiding in the lake. They take the locket and return to find that the Dark Mark has been placed over the highest tower in Hogwarts in their absence. Harry and Dumbledore ascend the tower where they are ambushed by Draco Malfoy, accompanied by Death Eaters that he helped get inside Hogwarts. Dumbledore freezes Harry under his Invisibility Cloak with a body-bind spell to keep him hidden. Draco disarms Dumbledore of his wand and then threatens to kill him, which turns out to have been his mission from Voldemort. Draco is unable to go through with it, and Snape arrives and casts the spell to kill Dumbledore instead. Harry ignores the battle raging in Hogwarts to pursue Dumbledore's killer. Snape successfully fights Harry off, and he reveals that he is in fact the Half-Blood Prince before he, Draco, and the rest of the Death Eaters escape.|$|E
25|$|The Duluth-based 148th Fighter Wing <b>expertly</b> {{provided}} real-time surveillance {{for ground}} commanders using their Theater Aerial Reconnaissance System.|$|E
25|$|Fischer (1997:422) {{remarks that}} the quality of {{inscription}} differs markedly between the two sides. Side a is <b>expertly</b> carved, with small, fine glyphs; side b less so, with larger and cruder glyphs, indicating that were written by different authors.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Assault was remade by {{director}} Jean-François Richet and starring Ethan Hawke and Laurence Fishburne. The Richet remake {{has been}} praised {{by some as}} an <b>expertly</b> made B-movie, and dismissed by others as formulaic, with many critics preferring the original Assault to the remake.|$|E
25|$|The first {{match of}} the {{campaign}} began against cross-town rivals Sydney Thunder at home (Sydney Cricket Ground). Sixers won the toss, electing to field. They were able to restrict the Thunder to 166 runs, with Usman Khawaja scoring 66. Sixers chased down the runs with 10 balls to spare. Player of the Match, Nic Maddinson <b>expertly</b> guided the Sixers to victory with 61 runs.|$|E
25|$|A classically trained singer, Scherzinger is {{comfortable}} {{singing in a}} variety of styles (jazz, theater, classical). Along with control and power, Nicole is able to sing complex melisma throughout her range, <b>expertly</b> alter the dynamics of her voice mid-phrase and, thanks to excellent breath control, hold notes effortlessly. Her mid-range is versatile and can be manipulated to add character and emotional colouring to a vocal. Nicole also possesses a whistle register.|$|E
25|$|Another stone at {{the farm}} may {{represent}} the remains a primitive cheese press. It is an <b>expertly</b> carved 'trough' with various holes, grooves and three vertical sides. The groove running horizontally along the 'back' may have helped support a wooden frame above the 'trough'. It may have been re-used for a different purpose {{at a later date}} and is unlikely to {{have been part of the}} 1760 press.|$|E
25|$|The {{blue jay}} {{occupies}} {{a variety of}} habitats within its large range, from the pine woods of Florida to the spruce-fir forests of northern Ontario. It is less abundant in denser forests, preferring mixed woodlands with oaks and beeches. It has <b>expertly</b> adapted to human activity, occurring in parks and residential areas, and can adapt to wholesale deforestation with relative ease if human activity creates other means for the jays to get by.|$|E
25|$|Goldwork is {{currently}} a fairly uncommon skill, even among embroiderers who work in other free embroidery styles; it is now most commonly used for the highest-quality church vestments and art embroidery. It has always been reserved for occasional and special use only, due to both {{the expense of the}} materials and the time to create the embroidery, and because the threads - no matter how <b>expertly</b> applied - will not hold up to frequent laundering of any kind.|$|E
25|$|After school, he was courted {{by several}} counties, {{including}} his birth county of Yorkshire, but began his first-class career for Northamptonshire in 1980, having impressed {{on a tour}} of the West Indies with England Young Cricketers. A right-arm fast-medium bowler, and an increasingly useful lower-order batsman, he was capable of bowling at a sharp pace, operating within himself and using the conditions <b>expertly.</b> He won his county cap in 1984, but moved to Somerset in 1987. He was an important part of the rebuilding process at Taunton, and soon became popular with members and players alike.|$|E
25|$|Strauss <b>expertly</b> {{managed the}} convention. At the 1972 convention, party infighting had delayed {{candidate}} McGovern's acceptance speech until late at night, when the television audience {{had gone to}} sleep. Strauss made sure that Carter's acceptance speech ran in prime time, and the convention ended with a memorable tableau: {{the leaders of the}} party's opposing wings, conservative George Wallace and liberal George McGovern, flanking Carter with clasped hands upraised. The Democrats entered the fall campaign united {{for the first time in}} years. Credit for this accomplishment was awarded to Chairman Strauss, and Carter quickly asked Strauss to chair his election campaign as well.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the finest}} {{examples}} is Howard House, No. 14 Fournier Street, a mansion house, built circa 1726 by 'carpenter and gentleman', William Taylor, for his own occupation but subsequently leased by silk weavers, 'Signeratt and Bourdillon'. It has three floors and a large garrett attic which once contained the loom. It is here that the silk for Queen Victoria's Coronation gown was woven. The unique hardwood staircase balustrade is carved to display fluted columns with Ionic capitals placed on each turn for one hundred steps. Indeed, each step is <b>expertly</b> carved with a masterly design of hops, barley, and wild roses.|$|E
25|$|The Truth According to Wikipedia {{was given}} {{positive}} reception by Eric Schonfeld of TechCrunch, who {{commented that the}} film was <b>expertly</b> created. Though he praised the documentary for displaying multiple different viewpoints, he was critical of the documentary's emphasis on Andrew Keen throughout, and said it became a tool for Keen to publicize his polemics against Wikipedia. Schonfeld assessed that Keen came away as the winner of his thesis {{by the end of}} the documentary. Of Keen's argument, Schonfeld pointed out that he did not address how researchers on Wikipedia could either be experts themselves, or subsequently become experts by virtue of improving the quality of articles on the website.|$|E
25|$|An award-winning 2014 HBO {{documentary}} about the case, The Newburgh Sting, showed that the attack plans and materials were all supplied by the FBI informant who coaxed the accused into participating by offering incentives including $250,000, described as a clear case of entrapment. The arrest was described (by the documentary) as having been <b>expertly</b> stage-managed {{in the style of}} a Hollywood production, needlessly deploying multiple armoured vehicles and over a hundred officers from various departments, including bomb squads although there was no bomb. The FBI, it was claimed, was motivated throughout by a desire to maintain public fear of terrorism and to enhance their reputation for effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|Yet, in {{attempting}} to show, in a mainstream movie, the reprehensibility of torture, and what was done in our name, the filmmakers seem to have conflated events, and in this they have generated a sore controversy: the chairs of two Senate committees {{have said that the}} information used to find bin Laden was not uncovered through waterboarding. Do such scenes hurt the movie? Not as art; they are <b>expertly</b> done, without flinching from the horror of the acts and without exploitation. But they damage the movie as an alleged authentic account. Bigelow and Boal– the team behind The Hurt Locker– want to claim the authority of fact and the freedom of fiction at the same time, and the contradiction mars an ambitious project.|$|E
25|$|Classical sources {{indicate}} that the trireme was capable of sustained speeds of ca. 6 knots at a relatively leisurely pace. There is also a reference by Xenophon of a single day's voyage from Byzantium to Heraclea Pontica, which translates as an average speed of 7.37 knots. These figures seem to be corroborated by the tests conducted with the reconstructed Olympias: a maximum speed of 8 knots and a steady speed of 4 knots could be maintained, with half the crew resting at a time. Given the imperfect nature of the reconstructed ship {{as well as the}} fact that it was manned by totally untrained modern men and women, it is reasonable to suggest that ancient triremes, <b>expertly</b> built and navigated by trained men, would attain higher speeds.|$|E
25|$|Hemphill style pottery spans {{most of the}} 14th and {{the first}} half of the 15th century CE In this time period there were more than likely only a few potters working in this style at any one time and in some cases archaeologists have found {{signature}} features that suggest a specific potter made multiple known examples. Archaeologists have also dated the ceramics and found that the most <b>expertly</b> made pieces were done in the 14th century. These earlier pieces also show more influences from outside thematic sources, specifically early Walls Phase and late Braden style shell engravings from the Central Mississippi Valley. As the 15th century progressed, less competency is shown by the potters, which may indicate that less importance was attached to this particular artform.|$|E
25|$|The {{company had}} a strict policy {{that they would}} not {{purchase}} any horses that were broke. The company wanted their horses trained exclusively for staging, a process that generally took three months, even then they were never truly broken and had to be <b>expertly</b> handled. A hostler would lead the teams out to the stages only once the baggage had been secured and the passengers and driver were safely seated. Once harnessed to the stage, the reins were given to the driver and he could release the brake. The stage horses often leaped and reared {{at the start of a}} trip, but settled into a smooth trot once they were underway. The whip rarely had to be used to encourage them, as they knew the next station meant a good feed and a warm stable.|$|E
25|$|According to Vasari, Uccello’s first {{painting}} was a Saint Anthony between the saints Cosmas and Damianus, a commission {{for the hospital}} of Lelmo. Next, he painted two figures in the convent of Annalena. Shortly afterwards, he painted three frescoes with scenes {{from the life of}} Saint Francis above the left door of the Santa Trinita church. For the Santa Maria Maggiore church, he painted a fresco of the Annunciation. In this fresco, he painted a large building with columns in perspective. According to Vasari, people found this to be a great and beautiful achievement because this was the first example of how lines could be <b>expertly</b> used to demonstrate perspective and size. As a result, this work became a model for artists who wished to craft illusions of space in order to enhance the realness of their paintings.|$|E
25|$|The Federal Government's {{first step}} towards {{agricultural}} research stations was {{the development of}} ETH Zurich, where the first two federal agricultural experimental stations were established in 1878: the Swiss Federal Seed Control Station and the Swiss Federal Agricultural Chemistry Experimental Station. Both stations grew very quickly. The Seed Control Station in particular developed into a world-renowned institute. Its founder, Friedrich Gottlieb Stebler led it <b>expertly</b> and successfully for 42 years. The topics studied included fertilisers and feedstuffs, soils, milk, wines, farm fertilisers etc.. A focal point was the further development of analysis methods. This provided {{the starting point for}} the subsequent founding of the Reckenholz location of the present-day Agroscope Reckenholz-Tänikon Research Station (ART). However, the second location, Tänikon TG, was only opened in 1970, at that time as a research station for rural economics and agricultural engineering.|$|E
25|$|Finally, at 10:25p.m., Jeff Jones {{gave the}} pre-arranged signal over a bullhorn, and the Weatherman action began. Jacobs, Jones, David Gilbert and others led a charge south {{through the city}} toward the Drake Hotel and the {{exceptionally}} affluent Gold Coast neighborhood, smashing windows in automobiles and buildings as they went. The mass of the crowd ran about four blocks before encountering police barricades. The mob charged the police but splintered into small groups, and more than 1,000 police counter-attacked. Although many protesters had—as J.J. did—motorcycle or football helmets on, the police were better trained and armed and nightsticks were <b>expertly</b> aimed to disable the rioters. Large amounts of tear gas were used, and at least twice police ran squad cars full speed into crowds. After only a half-hour or so, the riot was over: 28 policemen were injured (none seriously), six Weathermen were shot and an unknown number injured, and 68 protesters were arrested. Jacobs was arrested almost immediately.|$|E
25|$|The second title {{match of}} the night saw long time AAA World Tag Team Champions La Hermandad 187 (Nicho and Joe Lider) defend against Latin Lover and Marco Corleone, who were teaming {{together}} for the first time that night. La Hermandad <b>expertly</b> cut the ring in half, keeping Marco Corleone from tagging out so that they could wear him down. Corleone either came into the match with an existing injury or he bruised his thigh early in the match as he favored his right leg throughout most of the match. The crowd booed the supposed fan favorite Latin Lover every time he entered the ring to help out Corleone, which seemed to irritate him. The end came when rudo referee el Hijo del Tirantes tripped Marco Corleone as he was about to take his trademark leap out of the ring, allowing La Hermandad to pin Corleone, making their eight successful title defense in a row. Following the match Corleone and Latin Lover argued and left the ring separately.|$|E
25|$|Parma's next {{engagement}} {{was set to}} be the hosting of Juventus at the Tardini on 31 January, but it {{was called}} off after heavy snowfall. The match was re-scheduled for 15 February. It {{was the first time}} a game at the Tardini had been called off in exactly two years, when Internazionale visited. The mid-week postponement gave Parma extra rest before their third consecutive away match on a Sunday against Chievo, who had played on Thursday night. Both sides had two good chances in the first half, but it was Parma who took the lead, shortly after the break when the returning and freshly signed McDonald Mariga's chipped ball was <b>expertly</b> controlled by Giovinco, who proceeded to finish emphatically. However, the lead was short-lived: Modesto's poor defending allowed Cyril Théréau to finish easily from six yards. Parma had the better of the game after Chievo's equaliser and saw a couple of efforts saved, before a wide Giovinco free-kick was inadvertently sliced home by Chievo's Luciano to give Parma the victory.|$|E
25|$|The President of the United States of America takes {{pleasure}} in presenting the Silver Star to Lieutenant Colonel Thomas L. Ridge (MCSN: 0-5833), United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity as Commanding Officer of the Third Battalion, First Marines, FIRST Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor {{forces in the}} streets of Seoul, Korea, on 25 September 1950. Observing that hostile forces were stubbornly resisting the forward movement of his battalion, Lieutenant Colonel Ridge fearlessly moved elements of his command post to the immediate vicinity of the front lines in order to keep abreast of the situation and, repeatedly braving heavy hostile sniper and machine gun fire, skillfully directed his battalion's operations. Accurately estimating the enemy's capabilities and foreseeing a counterattack {{in the early hours of}} the next day, he <b>expertly</b> placed the units of his command on their night main line of resistance and, when the attack materialized, was primarily responsible for the success of the battalion in decisively defeating and throwing back the enemy with great loss in manpower and materiel. Although suffering from the pain of severe wounds to his hands, which had been inflicted when hostile phosphorus artillery shells landed in the command post, he courageously remained at his post throughout the night. His indomitable fighting spirit, tactical skill and heroic leadership during this aggressive action reflect great credit upon Lieutenant Colonel Ridge and the United States Naval Service.|$|E
25|$|The President of the United States of America, {{under the}} {{provisions}} of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting a Second Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster in lieu of a Third Award of the Distinguished Service Cross to Major William T. Whisner Jr., United States Air Force, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving as a Pilot with the 25th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, 51st Fighter Interceptor Wing, Fifth Air Force, in action against enemy forces in the Republic of Korea on 23 February 1952. On that date Major Whisner destroyed an enemy MiG-15 aircraft attacking an F-86 piloted by a member of his own group. Major Whisner flew to the immediate aid of the pilot {{in the face of the}} enemy's great numerical superiority. With an <b>expertly</b> executed maneuver, he attacked the MiG-15 which was pressing full attack on the friendly aircraft and forced the enemy to break away. As Major Whisner bore in to deter the enemy action, another MiG-15 swept down on his tail and began lobbing shells at his aircraft. In spite of the imminent danger of losing his own life, Major Whisner continued to force the first MiG-15 to break away, and, in the face of overwhelming odds, destroyed the enemy aircraft. The downed MIG-15 raised Major Whisner's record of enemy aircraft destruction to five and one-half and established him as the seventh jet ace of the Korean campaign.|$|E

500|$|As well as distortion, rock musicians {{have used}} audio feedback, which is {{normally}} undesirable. The use of feedback was pioneered by musicians such as John Lennon of The Beatles, Jeff Beck of The Yardbirds, Pete Townshend of The Who, and Jimi Hendrix.

500|$|Although New Jersey {{performed}} her job <b>expertly</b> {{during the}} intervention in Lebanon some {{have criticized the}} decision to have New Jersey shell Druze and Syrian forces. Members of this camp allege that this action forced {{a shift in the}} previously neutral U.S. forces by convincing local Lebanese Muslims that the United States had taken the Christian side; New Jerseys shells had killed hundreds of people, mostly Shiites and Druze. In his memoir, General Colin Powell (at the time an assistant to Caspar Weinberger) noted that [...] "When the shells started falling on the Shiites, they assumed the American ‘referee’ had taken sides." ...|$|E
