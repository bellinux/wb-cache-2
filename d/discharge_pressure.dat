The Philadelphia Fire Department nozzles allowed 100 psi nozzle pressure while One Meridian Plaza's pressure relief valves were giving less than 60 psi <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure,</b> which was not sufficient to fight the fire. It was several hours into the fire before a technician who could adjust the valves arrived at the scene.|$|E
25|$|The {{discharge}} valve is spring-loaded to a preset pressure <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure,</b> {{acting as a}} variable size restriction to hold a constant pressure in chamber D, despite varying fuel flow rates. The valve is opened as the discharge fuel pressure increases above the force from the spring, thereby lowering the fuel pressure to maintain a balanced position with the spring force.|$|E
500|$|The Projector had {{a number}} of defects. It was {{difficult}} to move, the tripod had the tendency to damage itself if it was dropped, and its <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure</b> has been described as [...] "feeble." [...] The phosphorus grenades exhibited a number of faults when used in the Projector; they could often explode inside the weapon if too much black powder were added, or fall short if too little were used, or even fail to explode. They could also break inside the barrel when fired which often led to the weapon being damaged and its crew injured. Even when fired properly, the Projector gave off a large cloud of smoke which could take up to a minute to clear and revealed the weapon's position. Bishop argues that its anti-tank abilities would have been 'doubtful' when it fired hand and rifle grenades, although he considers that the phosphorus grenades might have been more successful. To make handling easier, a lighter version of the weapon, the Northover Projector Mk 2 was developed in 1941, but few were produced.|$|E

2500|$|Aqueous {{film-forming}} foam (AFFF), used on A and B {{fires and}} for vapor suppression. The {{most common type}} in portable foam extinguishers. [...] AFFF {{was developed in the}} 1960s under Project Light Water in a joint venture between 3M and the U.S. Navy. AFFF forms a film that floats out before the foam blanket, sealing the surface and smothering the fire by excluding oxygen. AFFF is widely used for ARFF firefighting at airports, often as a twin agent unit (TAU) with purple-K dry chemical.It contains fluoro-tensides [...] which can be accumulated in the human body. The long-term effects of this on the human body and environment are unclear at this time. AFFF can be discharged through an air-aspirating branchpipe nozzle or a spray nozzle, and is now produced only in pre-mix form, where the foam concentrate is stored mixed with water. In the past, as solid charge model was produced, where the AFFF concentrate was housed as a dry compound in an external, disposable cartridge in a specially designed nozzle. The extinguisher body was charged with plain water, and the <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure</b> mixed the foam concentrate with the water upon squeezing the lever. These extinguishers received double the rating of a pre-mix model (40-B instead of 20-B), but are now considered obsolete, as parts and refill cartridges have been discontinued by the manufacturer.|$|E

By comparison, reciprocating compressors leave {{a small amount of}} compressed gas in the cylinder, because it is not practical for the piston to touch the head or valve plate.

40|$|Lecturepg. 47 Many {{centrifugal}} pump vibration problems {{are due to}} synchronous phenomena such as vane-pass frequency energy and running speed energy. To address such problems, guidelines {{have been developed to}} assist with their identification and to evaluate their severity. However, nonsynchronous phenomenon such as recirculation, stage-stall, and shaft instabilities can also cause vibration problems. These types of problems are more difficult or diagnose, since the excitation mechanisms are less obvious. Discussed herein are field measurements and computer analysis that were done to analyze and solve supersynchronous shaft vibration problem on a two-stage horizontal centrifugal coke crusher pump and a vertical single-stage centrifugal water pump. These pumps were marginally stable at low <b>discharge</b> <b>pressures,</b> but were unstable at high <b>discharge</b> <b>pressures.</b> Field tests indicated that the shaft instability vibrations of both pumps could be removed by installing vanes on {{the back side of the}} impellers (?pumpout? vanes).
