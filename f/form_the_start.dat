50|$|Over the years, Johannesburg and Pretoria (the Tshwane {{metropolitan}} area) {{have also}} been growing together, and the two cities share a common border.

Research suggests, however, that Pretoria is a metropolitan area in its own right, and that Johannesburg and Pretoria actually <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> of a megalopolitan system, with Johannesburg as its apex. The inclusion of another major metropolitan area to the south of Johannesburg, the Vaal Triangle, also forms part of this megalopolis, as a concept first coined and defined by French geographer Jean Gottmann.|$|E
50|$|A special “sync mark” is used {{to allow}} the disk {{controller}} {{to figure out where}} the data starts. This sync mark must follow the RLL code so that the controller can recognize it, but it does not follow the FM and MFM rules for clock bits. This way, it will never occur in any bit position in any encoded data stream. The shortest possible sync bit pattern, which follows the (1,3) RLL coding rules but cannot be produced by normal MFM coding, is 100010010001. In fact, the sync mark that is commonly used in MFM encoding starts with these twelve bits; it is called an “A1 sync” since the data bits <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> of the hexadecimal value A1 (10100001), but the fifth clock bit is different from the normal encoding of the A1 byte.|$|E

The pacemakers dropped away with half a mile left to run, at which point Dihistan took the advantage and led the field into the straight from Shahrastani and Shardari with Dancing Brave making progress. Shardari overtook Dihistan two furlong from the finish but was immediately challenged by Dancing Brave on the outside as Shahrastani began to struggle. Dancing Brave {{took the lead}} approaching the final furlong and drifted to the right, causing Shardari to switch to the left in the closing stages. Dancing Brave held off the renewed challenge of Shardari to win by {{three quarters of a}} length with a gap of four lengths back to the fast-finishing Triptych. Shahrastani was a further five lengths back in fourth, ahead of Dihistan, Petoski and Supreme Leader.|$|E
50|$|He {{returns to}} his {{business}} and becomes more active than ever. He continues to serve his mandates in several enterprises, and becomes {{a director of the}} Bank van Brussel on the Kouter in Ghent and becomes chairman of the Intifil cooperative and attempts to navigate the textile industry of Ghent through the war. At the surface he behaves as a strictly neutral citizen, but <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> of the Nazi occupation he commits himselve to help the prisoners of war, the deportees and the people forced to work in Germany. He refuses to pass on the lists of his employees to the Nazis, what brings him in 1942, for the Court martial. His commitment to resisting the occupation goes even further. Already in 1940, he joins the local resistance. He founded the Ghent department of the information service Zero and is provincial agent for the Socrates group which supports people hiding from the Nazis and organised flight routes. He helps his future son-in-law, Charles Waegemans, to escape to London. Through Albert Maertens he gets involved in the distribution of underground newspapers such as The Belfort and at the activities of the Onafhankelijkheidsfront (E: Independence Front). His contacts in the financial and industrial world and his leading position within freemasonry (as chairing master of Le Septentrion) also mean an important support for the resistance movement.|$|E
5000|$|In June 2016, Cicilia {{signed a}} two-year {{contract}} with EFL League One club Port Vale. He started {{just two of}} the opening ten games of the 2016-17 season and found himself competing with Martin Paterson behind Anton Forrester in the first team pecking order; Cicilia said that additional conditioning work helped him {{to adjust to the}} physicality of the English game.

His size and unconventional playing style quickly made him a 'cult hero' for Vale fans, who nicknamed him 'Reggie'. However Bruno Ribeiro rarely played Cicilia <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> of matches, believing him to be more of an impact substitute. He was sidelined with a calf strain injury in February. He returned to action after a four-week absence, but failed to add to his goal tally, and was sent off for two bookable offence on the final home game of the season - a 2-0 defeat to Bolton Wanderers on 22 April; caretaker-manager Michael Brown said that the sending off was harsh. He left Port Vale following the club's relegation in May 2017 after he and Brown came to a mutual agreement to end his contract.|$|E
