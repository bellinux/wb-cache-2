2500|$|Nitrogen from soil {{gets into}} the water, and can be {{hazardous}} to human health. [...] <b>EC</b> <b>Directive</b> 80/778/EEC and 91/676/EEC both mention a ceiling acceptable level of nitrates of 50mg/litre, {{which is also the}} level recommended by the World Health Organisation. [...] In several places in Britain, particularly in the midlands and the south-east, nitrate concentrations occasionally exceed this level and the government has brought in regulations to control nitrate levels in the water. The regulations governing designated Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZ) aim to protect ground and surface water from contamination with nitrates and manure. [...] The Nitrates Directive was reviewed and expanded in 2008, and with the 2008 expansion, from 1 January 2009 around 68% of English farmland, 14% of Scottish farmland and 4% of Welsh farmland is within a NVZ. The NVZ rules control at what time of year farmers may apply nitrogen or manure to the land and oblige them to keep strict records of nitrogen-containing substances used. [...] They also regulate slurry and manure storage.|$|E

50|$|Vehicle Type Approval is the {{confirmation}} that production samples of a design will meet specified performance standards. Traditionally, {{there are two}} systems of Type Approval in Europe. The first one bases on the <b>EC</b> <b>Directives</b> and regulates the approval of whole vehicles, vehicle systems, and separate components. The second one {{is part of the}} United Nations Economic Commission for Europe regulations (UNECE) and also regulates the approval of whole vehicles, vehicle systems, and separate components. Recent changes to the requirements have seen the General Safety Regulation (GSR) EC661/2009 amending Directive 2007/46/EC by substituting the equivalent UNECE Regulations in place of the <b>EC</b> <b>Directives.</b> In effect the Directives are being replaced by UNECE Regulations.

40|$|This chart {{compares the}} <b>EC</b> Procurement <b>Directives</b> and the UNCITRAL Model Law on Procurement of Goods, Construction and Services. Most {{central and eastern}} European {{countries}} used the Model Law {{as the basis of}} their public procurement laws in the early 1990 s. Now that many countries of the region are candidates for EU accession, they must adapt their laws to <b>EC</b> <b>Directives.</b> The aim of the chart is to assist in that process. The <b>EC</b> Procurement <b>Directives</b> were introduced into the European Union to further the EU’s policy of enabling enterprises from all EU states to compete fairly in public procurement markets. The most important objective of this policy is to prevent discrimination by procuring entities in favour of their own national enterprises. The <b>EC</b> <b>Directives</b> support this by, inter alia, requiring major contracts to be advertised, open to competition, and awarded through transparent procedures. These conditions make it difficult to disguise discrimination. The UNCITRAL Model Law on Procurement of Goods, Construction and Services sets out procedures for the award of public contracts. It is designed for the use of countries introducing procurement laws, or reforming their procurement systems, with the aims of achieving economy and efficiency in public procurement and reducing corruption. The Model Law also seeks to promote international competition in public procurement markets. States should in general seek these objectives by advertising and holding a competition for procurements, and awarding contracts through transparent procedures. ...|$|R
