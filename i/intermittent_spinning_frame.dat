5000|$|For some time, the {{stronger}} yarn {{produced by the}} <b>spinning</b> <b>frame</b> was used in looms for the lengthwise [...] "warp" [...] threads that bound cloth together, while hand powered jennies provided the weaker yarn used for the horizontal filler [...] "weft" [...] threads.

50|$|The water {{frame is}} derived from the use of a water wheel to drive a number of <b>spinning</b> <b>frames.</b> The water wheel {{provided}} more power to the <b>spinning</b> <b>frame</b> than human operators, reducing the amount of human labor needed and increasing the spindle count dramatically. However, unlike the spinning jenny, the water <b>frame</b> could <b>spin</b> only one thread at a time until Samuel Compton combined the two inventions into his spinning mule in 1779.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: To {{improve the}} yarn quality, the {{pressure}} bar {{was installed in}} the break drafting zone of the INA-V <b>spinning</b> <b>frame.</b> The process parameters were optimized in the break drafting zone with pressure bar of the INA-V <b>spinning</b> <b>frame,</b> the drafting principle in the break drafting zone with pressure bar of INA-V <b>spinning</b> <b>frame</b> was analyzed, and the sliver configuration was observed in the break drafting zone with pressure bar. The result revealed that installed the pressure bar in break drafting zone after, when the roving twist factor was small, CV%, thinness, thickness and neps of the yarn spun decrease as the break drafting ratio increase; when the twist factor of roving was larger, the break draft ratio as 1. 3 time was optimum drafting conditions. The yarn quality was improved as roving twist increased...|$|R
40|$|The spin Guard Gardella is a {{centrifugal}} type {{dry spinning}} machine. In this machine yarn can be spun from 72 (2. 08 lbs. /spy) to 241 tex (7 lbs. /spy). But {{in this system}} of this machine, it is preferable to produce fine yarn. Here fine yarn 103 tex (3 lbs. /spy) was produced in existing speed. Apron Draft <b>Spinning</b> <b>frame</b> was modified into ring spinning system. In this system rings and travelers were used and fine yarn upto 103 tex (3 lbs. /spy) was produced. Bangla white B (BWB) grade jute fibres were used for producing fine yarn. The spinning performance and physical properties of produced yarn were found and compared.

25|$|The {{spinning}} jenny, a multi-spool {{spinning wheel}} invented c. 1764 by James Hargreaves, dramatically reduced {{the amount of}} work needed to produce yarn of high consistency, with a single worker able to work eight or more spools at once. At roughly the same time, Richard Arkwright and a team of craftsmen developed the <b>spinning</b> <b>frame,</b> which produced a stronger thread than the spinning jenny. Too large to be operated by hand, a <b>spinning</b> <b>frame</b> powered by a waterwheel became the water frame.|$|R

25|$|This is a later {{development}} of the ring <b>spinning</b> <b>frame.</b> The passage of the yarn from the front rollers to the paper tube - used {{in place of a}} bobbin - is different from other types of <b>spinning</b> <b>frames.</b> When the yarn leaves the rollers it passes direct to the top of an elongated spindle and coils round it two or three times before forming a balloon to the ring traveller. This enables the twist to be imparted between the spindle top and roller nip, thus helping to produce a smoother yarn.|$|R

40|$|The {{effective}} {{weight of a}} cup in a cup <b>spinning</b> <b>frame</b> {{is the difference between}} the actual weight of the cup and the resistance of fibers withdrawn from the cup.

50|$|For instance, when {{holding onto}} a {{carousel}} that turns at {{constant angular velocity}} you experience a radially inward (centripetal) proper-acceleration due to {{the interaction between the}} handhold and your hand. This cancels the radially outward geometric acceleration associated with your <b>spinning</b> coordinate <b>frame.</b> This outward acceleration (from the <b>spinning</b> <b>frame's</b> perspective) will become the coordinate acceleration when you let go, causing you to fly off along a zero proper-acceleration (geodesic) path. Unaccelerated observers, of course, in their frame simply see your equal proper and coordinate accelerations vanish when you let go.|$|R
