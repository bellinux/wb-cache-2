50|$|The {{general term}} {{nebulizer}} {{refers to an}} apparatus that converts liquids into a fine mist. Nozzles also convert liquids into a fine mist, but do so by pressure through small holes.

50|$|Common {{analytical}} {{techniques used}} for quantitative determinations in environmental chemistry include classical wet chemistry, such as gravimetric, titrimetric and electrochemical methods.

Metals are commonly measured by atomic spectroscopy and mass spectrometry: Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (AAS) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission (<b>ICP-AES)</b> or Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometric (ICP-MS) techniques. Organic compounds are commonly measured also using mass spectrometric methods, such as Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Tandem Mass spectrometry MS/MS and High Resolution/Accurate Mass spectrometry HR/AM offer sub part per trillion detection.

50|$|NAA {{can perform}} {{non-destructive}} analyses on solids, liquids, suspensions, slurries, and gases with no or minimal preparation. Due to the penetrating nature of incident neutrons and resultant gamma rays, the technique provides a true bulk analysis. As different radioisotopes have different half-lives, counting can be delayed to allow interfering species to decay eliminating interference. Until {{the introduction of}} <b>ICP-AES</b> and PIXE, NAA was the standard analytical method for performing multi-element analyses with minimum detection limits in the sub-ppm range. Accuracy of NAA is {{in the region of}} 5%, and relative precision is often better than 0.1%. There are two noteworthy drawbacks to the use of NAA; even though the technique is essentially non-destructive, the irradiated sample will remain radioactive for many years after the initial analysis, requiring handling and disposal protocols for low-level to medium-level radioactive material; also, the number of suitable activation nuclear reactors is declining; with a lack of irradiation facilities, the technique has declined in popularity and become more expensive.|$|E
50|$|The {{examination}} of the Nahal Hemar artifacts included: 1. All the plaster statue fragments and plaster beads were examined under a Wild M-8 stereoscopic microscope under oblique illumination. This was used in order to roughly define the homogeneity of the samples. 2. Tiny lumps of plaster {{were removed from the}} items on several locations using a diamonds saw, spatulas, and fine drills bits. Chips with the film casting pigments were sampled in several cases for chemical analyses of straining materials. They used broken artifacts in most cases to prevent further damage to the remaining artifacts. 3. Bulk samples were subjected to Thin-Section Petrographic Analysis (TSPA). 4. Mineralogical analyses of the non calcareous components were carried out to more samples, in which the admixture of clay was observed by the TSPA analysis. The samples were powdered and soaked in 3% HCl to remove the carbonate ingredients and the clay mineralogy was determined by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). 5. Chemical analyses were done on most samples using Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometry (<b>ICP-AES).</b> The benefit of this method is that it has high accuracy with low limits of detection. 6. Small lumps that were coated with yellow, green, red, or dark pigments were removed from the plaster statue and beads and used for X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) analysis, which provided a chemical definition of the pigment materials.|$|E
50|$|The {{results of}} the study: Beads: All but one bead was {{produced}} from a mixture of burnt lime and calcite crystals. The one bead without this mixture had anhydrite crystal also appear within the burnt lime (this was indicated by both TSPA and <b>ICP-AES</b> analyses). The most important trait {{is that all the}} beads are dense contents of calcite crystals. It can be concluded that the beads were likely all made in the same place and for the same reason and all had the same use. All of the beads were made by the same technique, which can be seen in their mineralogy and chemistry. Because the beads were all so closely related, it seems likely that they were all made for the same purpose. It is assumed that the beads were used as parts of garments or costumes for a specific event.Statues: The statues have opposite homogeneity as compared to the beads and baskets. The statues vary greatly in their technology and compositions. The statues can be broken up into seemingly four different categories of statues based on their composition. This hints to the fact they were likely built in different locations and were brought to Nahal Hemar in their present state. There was more than likely little done to the statues once they got into Nehal Hemar. It is thought that the statues were used for ceremonies or ritual activities and the different statues had different symbols.|$|E

40|$|Understanding spatial {{variation}} of potentially toxic trace elements (PTEs) in soil {{is necessary to}} identify the proper measures for preventing soil contamination at both operating and abandoned mining areas. Many {{studies have been conducted}} worldwide to explore the spatial {{variation of}} PTEs and to create soil contamination maps using geostatistical methods. However, they generally depend only on inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (<b>ICP–AES)</b> analysis data, therefore such studies are limited by insufficient input data owing to the disadvantages of <b>ICP–AES</b> analysis such as its costly operation and lengthy period required for analysis. To overcome this limitation, this study used both <b>ICP–AES</b> and portable X-ray fluorescence (PXRF) analysis data, with relatively low accuracy, for mapping copper and lead concentrations at a section of the Busan abandoned mine in Korea and compared the prediction performances of four different approaches: the application of ordinary kriging to <b>ICP–AES</b> analysis data, PXRF analysis data, both <b>ICP–AES</b> and transformed PXRF analysis data by considering the correlation between the <b>ICP–AES</b> and PXRF analysis data, and co-kriging to both the <b>ICP–AES</b> (primary variable) and PXRF analysis data (secondary variable). Their results were compared using an independent validation data set. The results obtained in this case study showed that the application of ordinary kriging to both <b>ICP–AES</b> and transformed PXRF analysis data is the most accurate approach when considers the spatial distribution of copper and lead contaminants in the soil and the estimation errors at 11 sampling points for validation. Therefore, when generating soil contamination maps for an abandoned mine, it is beneficial to use the proposed approach that incorporates the advantageous aspects of both <b>ICP–AES</b> and PXRF analysis data...|$|E

40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{energy dispersive}} X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) spectrometry method {{was developed for}} determining the concentration of palladium (Pd) applied to tobacco cut filler. Control and standards were created in-house with different levels of Pd concentration. After application of the Pd in a salt solution, the tobacco had an average oven volatiles (OV) value of 27. 6 %. Three aliquots were analyzed at each concentration level by EDXRF and inductively coupled plasma- atomic emission spectrometry (<b>ICP-AES).</b> Results were plotted against target values to perform a linear regression. EDXRF and <b>ICP-AES</b> coefficient of determination (R 2) values were both lower than the accepted minimum value of 0. 990. Also, measured concentrations varied significantly between replicates. To improve the calibration technique, two options were evaluated: (a) Improve sample homogeneity by lyophilizing and finely grinding the tobacco, and (b) Improve the linear fit of the EDXRF calibration curve by plotting against <b>ICP-AES</b> results. EDXRF and <b>ICP-AES</b> analyses were performed on lyophilized samples with an average OV value of 3. 3 %. Results demonstrated minimum variation between replicates and distinct variation between levels of concentration.

For evaluation of option (b), EDXRF results were plotted against <b>ICP-AES</b> results to create the calibration curve with an R 2 value of 0. 994.

40|$|Coupling {{dispersive}} liquid-liquid micro-extraction (DLLME) to {{inductively coupled plasma}} atomic {{emission spectrometry}} (<b>ICP-AES)</b> is usually troublesome due to the limited plasma tolerance to the organic solvents usually employed for metal extraction. This work explores different coupling strategies allowing the multi-element determination by <b>ICP-AES</b> of the solutions obtained after DLLME procedures. To this end, {{three of the most}} common extractant solvents in DLLME procedures (1 -undecanol, 1 -butyl- 3 -methyl-imidazolium hexafluorophosphate and chloroform) have been selected to face most of the main problems reported in DLLME-ICP-AES coupling (i. e., those arising from the high solvent viscosity and volatility). Results demonstrate that DLLME can be successfully coupled to <b>ICP-AES</b> after a careful optimization of the experimental conditions. Thus, elemental analysis in 1 -undecanol and 1 -butyl- 3 -methyl-imidazolium hexafluorophosphate extracts can be achieved by <b>ICP-AES</b> after a simple dilution step with methanol (1 : 0. 5). Chloroform can be directly introduced into the plasma with minimum changes in the <b>ICP-AES</b> configuration usually employed when operating with aqueous solutions. Diluted inorganic acid solutions (1 % w w− 1 either nitric or hydrochloric acids) have been successfully tested {{for the first time as}} a carrier for the introduction of organic extractants in <b>ICP-AES.</b> The coupling strategies proposed have been successfully applied to the multi-element analysis (Al, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni and Zn) of different water samples (i. e. marine, tap and river) by DLLME-ICP-AES.

40|$|Liquid chromatography-tandem mass {{spectrometry}} (LC-MS/MS) and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (<b>ICP-AES)</b> methods were developed and validated {{for the evaluation}} of motexafin lutetium (MLu, lutetium texaphyrin, PCI- 0123) pharmacokinetics in human plasma. The LC-MS/MS method was specific for MLu, whereas the <b>ICP-AES</b> method measured total elemental lutetium. Both methods were fast, simple, precise, and accurate. For the LC-MS/MS method, a closely related analogue (PCI- 0353) was used as the internal standard (IS). MLu and the IS were extracted from plasma by protein precipitation and injected onto and LC-MS/MS system configured with a C 18 column and an electrospray interface. The lower limit of quantitation was 0. 05 μg MLu mL− 1, with a signal-to-noise ratio of 15 ∶ 1. The response was linear from 0. 05 to 5. 0 μg MLu mL− 1. For the <b>ICP-AES</b> method, indium was used as the IS. The sample was digested with nitric acid, diluted, filtered, and then injected onto the <b>ICP-AES</b> system. Two standard curve ranges were validated to meet the expected range of sample concentrations: 0. 5 to 50, and 0. 1 to 10 μg Lu mL− 1. The LC-MS/MS and <b>ICP-AES</b> methods were validated to establish accuracy, precision, analyte stability, and assay robustness. Interday precision and accuracy of quality control samples were ≤ 6. 3 % coefficient of variation (CV) and within 2. 2 % relative error (RE) for the LC-MS/MS method, and ≤ 8. 7 % CV and within 4. 9 % RE for the <b>ICP-AES</b> method. Plasma samples from a subset of patients in a clinical study were analyzed using both methods. For a representative patient, over 90 % of the elemental lutetium in plasma could be ascribed to intact MLu at early time points. This percentage decreased to 59 % at 48 hours after dosing, suggesting that some degradation and/or metabolism of the drug may have occurred...|$|E
40|$|The {{accuracy}} and precision of catalytic converter analysis using conventional analytical methodology such as fire assay, x-ray fluorescence, atomic absorption and <b>ICP-AES</b> are typically {{in the range of}} ± 7 - 10 % RSD. Due to the high cost of noble metals, methods of analysis with increased {{accuracy and}} precision are desired to evaluate the loading of noble metals onto converter bricks. The investigations described in this work have resulted in a better understanding of many of the inherent problems and have contributed new approaches for sample dissolution and analysis using array detector based Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (<b>ICP-AES)</b> and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). These methods are shown to be accurate and precise for the analysis of Pt, Pd, and Rh in catalytic converters. Catalytic converters are difficult to dissolve by conventional acid methodology. While carius, tubes have previously been employed to dissolve small weights of sample, complete dissolution of increased amounts of sample, as needed for high precision <b>ICP-AES</b> analysis, has been hindered by the insufficient oxidation potential of the acids in the carius tube. In this work, the addition of ferric chloride is shown to increase the dissolving power of the carius tube method and specifically targets Pt, Pd and Rh for dissolution. Simultaneous collection of analyte wavelengths and simultaneous background correction, as performed with multichannel array detector <b>ICP-AES</b> instrumentation, have enhanced sensitivity and precision in catalytic converter analysis when compared to single channel instrumentation. The studies described within this dissertation demonstrate that flicker noise has been effectively eliminated through the use of multichannel array based <b>ICP-AES</b> instrumentation. With proper line selection {{and the use of the}} high-resolution system, Pt, Pd and Rh in catalytic converters can be analyzed with precision of 1 - 1. 5 %. <b>ICP-AES</b> accuracy has been confirmed through isotope dilution ICP-MS employing new methodology to avoid Zr isobaric interferences...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{evaluates the}} analytical capabilities {{of a field}} portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (pXRF) for the measurement of contaminated soil samples using a matrix-matched calibration. The calibrated pXRF generated exceptional data quality from the measurement of ten soil reference materials. Elemental recoveries improved for all 11 elements post-calibration with reduced measurement variation and detection limits in most cases. Measurement repeatability of reference values ranged between 0. 2 and 10 % relative standard deviation, while the majority (82 %) of reference recoveries were between 90 and 110 %. Definitive data quality, the highest of the US EPA's three level quality ranking, was achieved for 15 of 19 elemental datasets. Measurement comparability against inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (<b>ICP-AES)</b> values was excellent for most elements (e. g, r² 0. 999 for Mn and Pb, r² > 0. 995 for Cu, Zn and Cd). Parallel measurement of reference materials revealed <b>ICP-AES</b> and ICP-MS measured Ti and Cr poorly when compared to pXRF. Individual recoveries of soil reference materials by both <b>ICP-AES</b> and pXRF showed that pXRF was equivalent to or better than <b>ICP-AES</b> values for all but two elements (Ni, As). This study demonstrates pXRF as a suitable alternative to <b>ICP-AES</b> analysis in the measurement of Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Sr, Cd, and Pb in metal-contaminated soils.
