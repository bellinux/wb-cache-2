50|$|Many amateur {{telescope}} makers use cells {{which are}} designed via equal area rule calculation, using {{programs such as}} David Chandler's public domain program, Cell. However, such calculation {{does not account for}} mechanical stresses introduced in one part of a telescope mirror by another part, whereas finite element analysis can be used to reduce such stress. Although general finite element analysis programs such as Nastran will work for mirror cells, an advantage of PLOP is that it can be set to ignore deformation that merely results in refocus of a mirror's parabola. PLOP can be used to calculate floating support points for a mirror's axial (rear) support; however, additional tools are needed to calculate potential error from a mirror's lateral (<b>edge)</b> <b>support.</b>|$|E

The towers would have been entered on the first floor via a wooden staircase from the outside. There were no windows, just arrowslits, suggesting that the towers were purely for defence, not residence.|$|E

The notable change is the inclusion of EGRPS (GPRS with mandatory <b>EDGE</b> <b>support)</b> in the GSM-R specification, corresponding to the new Eirene FRS 8 / SRS 16 specifications. Additionally B3R2 includes the ETCS Driver Machine Interface and the SRS 3.5.0. This Baseline 3 series was accepted by European Commission with decisions 2016/919/EC in late May 2016. The decision references ETCS SRS 3.6.0 that was subsequently published by the ERA in a Set 3 in June 2016. The publications of the European Commission and ERA for SRS 3.6.0 were synchronized to the same day, June 15.

40|$|The {{target of}} this {{research}} is to study the property of the assumptions in the yield line theory and to give practical design method to be used in design. This work is meant to cover an investigation of six slabs. The support condition of these slabs were simply supported, simply and fixed supported, and fixed. The reinforcement arrangement used is isotropic reinforcement. The yield line theory was used as the method of solution to obtain the ultimate load. To verify the analytical results, experimentally the six rectangular two- way slabs subjected to uniformly distributed load are simulated by 16 point loads with various combinations of the possible boundary conditions (simply <b>supported</b> at all <b>edges,</b> fixed <b>supported</b> at one short <b>edge</b> and simply <b>supported</b> at the remaining <b>edges,</b> fixed <b>supported</b> at one long <b>edge</b> and simply <b>supported</b> at the remaining <b>edges,</b> fixed <b>supported</b> at two short <b>edges</b> and simply <b>supported</b> at the other <b>edges,</b> fixed <b>supported</b> at two long <b>edges</b> and simply <b>supported</b> at the two short edges, and the last slab was fixed <b>supported</b> at all <b>edges.</b> Data of the experimental work including deflection readings, and yield line patterns are presented.) Experimental results are discussed and comparisons are made between the theoretical and experimental result. Finally conclusions are drawn and recommendations are presented. It can be concluded that the difference between the experimental and theoretical failure loads were small and mainly on the conservative side. Significant increase in load carrying capacity of isotropically reinforced fixed supported slabs is due to compressive membrane action imposed by horizontal restraints. Also similar yield line patterns for theoretical and experimental cases were observed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This work {{describes}} {{a study of}} vibration characteristics of thin circular plates with elastic <b>edge</b> <b>support</b> and resting on partial Winkler-type elastic foundation. The foundation is described by the Winkler model, which is called as single parameter foundation. The exact analytical method is used to derive the frequency equation of the circular plate with elastic edge support-conditions and resting on partial elastic foundation system. Parametric investigations {{on the behavior of}} circular plates with elastic <b>edge</b> <b>support</b> and resting on partial elastic foundation have been carried out with respect to various values of transverse stiffness parameter, foundation parameter for a variety of boundary conditions. Extensive data is tabulated so that pertinent conclusions can be arrived at on the influence of translational edge restraint, and the foundation modulus parameters of the Winkler foundation on the natural frequencies of uniform isotropic circular plates. A comparison of the results obtained here in this paper with those available in the literature shows an excellent agreement...|$|E

An analytical solution of the traveling wave form along the simply <b>supported</b> <b>edges</b> and the standing wave form along the remaining two edges is obtained based on the Flügge thin shell theory. With such a unidirectional traveling wave form solution, the method of reverberation-ray matrix is introduced to derive the equation of natural frequencies of the open circular cylindrical shell with various boundary conditions. Then, the golden section search algorithm is employed to obtain the natural frequencies of the open circular cylindrical shell. The calculation results are compared with those obtained by the finite {{element method and the}} method in available literature. Finally, the natural frequencies of the open circular cylindrical shell with various boundary conditions are calculated and the effects of boundary conditions on the natural frequencies are examined.
