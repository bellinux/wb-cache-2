40|$|In {{the last}} decade, the European air {{transport}} industry {{has undergone a}} process in several stages of transition towards a single market. Liberalization has been {{closely linked to the}} effective application of the state aid rules of the EC Treaty. In principle, direct aid to undertakings within the common market is not prohibited by the state aid rules in the Treaty. However, aid granted by Member States that distorts or threatens to distort competition by giving one airline an unfair advantage over its competitors, and in so far as it affects trade between Member States, is incompatible with the Treaty. Certain mandatory or discretionary exemptions may apply to aid to airlines providing that the measure fulfills the conditions and requirements as stated by the Treaty. The European Commission and the <b>EFTA</b> <b>Surveillance</b> <b>Authority</b> have a wide discretion in deciding whether or not certain aid measures fall within the stated exemptions. Where the market forces alone are not able to achieve the desired results or if they are only able to do so in a limited capacity, such exemptions may be warranted to the extent not contrary to the common interest. A special mechanism is in place to ensure that state aid is properly scrutinized {{in the light of the}} demands of the Treaty and the EEA Agreement.

40|$|This Scientific Report of EFSA {{provides}} {{scientific and}} technical assistance to the European Free Trade Association (<b>EFTA)</b> <b>Surveillance</b> <b>Authority</b> in evaluating i) if the Norwegian continuous use of fishmeal in feed for ruminants until 30 April 2010 has {{had an impact on}} the overall risk of BSE in the country; and ii) if a proposed Norwegian revised annual monitoring programme for BSE allows the detection of BSE with a yearly design prevalence of at least one case per 100, 000 in the adult population at a confidence level of 95 %. Data related to the implementation of the Norwegian feed ban were collected and assessed. The Cattle TSE Monitoring Model (C-TSEMM) was used in order to answer the second term of reference of the mandate received. It is concluded that the use of fishmeal in feed for ruminants might have had a potential impact on the risk of cattle exposure to BSE in Norway. While it is not possible to quantitatively assess this risk, the lack of detection of BSE cases by the Norwegian monitoring system (in spite of its sensitivity limits) suggests that BSE has not significantly spread in the Norwegian cattle population. The proposed revised Norwegian BSE monitoring regime would not be able to meet a yearly design prevalence of at least one case per 100, 000 in the adult cattle population at a confidence level of 95 %. Moreover, in statistical terms it is not feasible for Norway to achieve the requested design prevalence. It is furthermore highlighted that passing from a sample-based to an exhaustive monitoring scheme (i. e. testing all animals over a certain age that are slaughtered or dead) would provide the most sensitive BSE surveillance system currently possible...|$|R
40|$|Summary: The Icelandic {{internet}} bank Icesave {{went bankrupt}} in late 2008. The insufficient Icelandic deposit guarantee scheme (Tryggingasjóður) did not resist the Icelandic financial meltdown {{and failed to}} compensate British and Dutch depositors the guaranteed sum of EUR 20, 887 as settled in Directive 94 / 19 /EC, which accor¬ding to the European Economic Area Agreement (EEA) regulates the Icelandic financial sector. The British and Dutch deposit schemes paid out guarantees to their national Icesave depositors {{on behalf of the}} Icelandic scheme. Subsequently, an agreement was reached betwe¬en Iceland, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. As part of the arrangement, the Icelandic government guaranteed the reimburse¬ment of the British and Dutch bridging loan. The Icelandic referendum of 6 February 2010 rejected the agreement and the Icesave Act, which torpedoed the Icesave reimbursement plan. The <b>EFTA</b> <b>Surveillance</b> <b>Authority</b> (ESA) issued a formal reprimand to Iceland. However, this has not been followed by any infringement proceedings as provided for by the EEA agreement. My position is that the ESA position results from a confusion of regulatory commitments with pecuniary liabilities. The key point is whether the Icelandic guarantee is in accordance with EU Directive 94 / 19 /EC. The Directive requires the legislator to act. It is not a directive to force the government to pay (see Directive 94 / 19 /EC Article 3. 1.) This provision contributes to the implementa¬tion of the ban on Member States against guarantee schemes that distort competition. The schemes are self-financing and fully paid by the financial institutions. In the case of insufficient coverage, all depo¬sitors are subject to an equal pro rata reduction in compensation, as the scheme guarantee of full payment of the deposit guarantee sum of EUR 20, 887 is an objective to be reached within a reasonable time and not a legal right from day one. Government aid to top up the fund is prohibited, whether it is the intention or consequence. The Icelandic government cannot cover the scheme’s insufficiency by granting mo¬ney to the fund. As the EU enjoys exclusive autonomy over its external relations, Member States cannot bilaterally arrange for such a solu¬tion. Thus, depositors not fully reimbursed are stuck with Icelandic bankruptcy proceedings. Claims are considered by the administrators in accordance with the Icelandic Bankruptcy Act on outstanding debts not paid out by the deposit guarantee scheme...|$|R
40|$|The Member States of the European Communities (EC), EC, and the {{countries}} of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) have concluded the Agreement on European Economic Area (EEA Agreement). When such a combined regional community is formed, while each of these constituting bodies does not cease to exist, a question arises as to what legal constraints are necessitated to avoid divergent application of law among the members. This paper analyzes this question through examination of the EEA institutional system by focusing on the principle of homogeneity. The EEA system can be well understood by viewing it {{from the standpoint of the}} homogeneity principle, which includes two normative requirements. Firstly, it requires the EFTA/EC and their countries secure uniform interpretation of provisions of EEA law. Secondly, it requires that the substantive outcome of the application of the EEA Agreement is homogeneous. These requirements are embedded in the EEA institutional system, which contains not only a number of provisions identical in substance to those of the EC Treaty, but also a procedure for incorporating later EC secondary legislation into the national law of EFTA countries. Regard should also be paid to the EFTA Court as its own judicial organ and the <b>EFTA</b> <b>Surveillance</b> <b>Authority,</b> whose task is to supervise the application of EEA law within the EFTA. This overview shows that the EEA system is built up very similarly to the corresponding EC system, and thereby intends to manage the possibility of divergent development of law. However, the possibility cannot be excluded that the EFTA court may apply EEA law differently within the EFTA framework. The principle of homogeneity again makes up for this deficiency in the EFTA judicial system, i. e., intervention of EC Organ/Member States in the procedure, the case-law information exchange, and monitoring by the EEA Joint Committee. Furthermore, the EFTA Court very often refers the case of the ECJ, and even adopts precedents of constitutional relevance in order to secure homogeneous interpretation and application of the EEA law in so far as homogeneity is concerned. These solutions by the EEA to the divergent problems functions well so far. However, this cannot be easily applicable to the integration of multiple regional communities in general. Two prerequisites of the EEA system must be pointed out. Firstly, the system has been developed under strong influence of the preceding EC acquis. Secondly, it is assumed that the judicial organs play an active role in the governance of integration. Though these points need to be kept in mind, the principle of homogeneity as applied in the EEA is an appreciable legal solution to the unavoidable problems regarding integrating multiple regional communities. ...|$|R
