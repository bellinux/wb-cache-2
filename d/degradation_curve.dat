40|$|The maximum {{shear modulus}} is {{generally}} defined from the stress-strain relationship obtained from laboratory tests. The monotonic loading test has recently gained popularity {{in this role}} due to its simplicity. Stiffness degradation curve; the semi-logarithmic plot between stiffness and strain level, is usually prepared in such a study. The present study points at the shortcoming of the stiffness <b>degradation</b> <b>curve</b> obtained from a monotonic loading test in determination of the maximum stiffness. A simple calculation based on errands of the semi-logarithmic plot is presented first. Next {{the results of the}} triaxial tests that have been conducted for this study are presented in order to demonstrate this discrepancy. It is observed that the <b>degradation</b> <b>curve</b> from a monotonic loading test can mislead the determination of the maximum stiffness. The explanation offered is that the initial or reference point (i. e., initial stress and strain) used for computing the secant stiffness plays a significant influence on the computed value of the maximum stiffness. Moreover, the conventional <b>degradation</b> <b>curve</b> defined from any point on the stress-strain relationship will always exhibit the elastic-like behavior. Namely, the secant stiffness gradually decreases from its maximum value. The present study calls for great caution in usage of the <b>degradation</b> <b>curve</b> obtained from a monotonic loading test...|$|E

40|$|Thermogravimetric {{curves of}} virgin- and waste-PVC in an {{atmosphere}} of nitrogen and nitrogen saturated with water vapour were recorded at several heating rates to determine degradation kinetics. The <b>degradation</b> <b>curves</b> of virgin-PVC showed two stages of considerable mass loss. Application of the Friedman method to the experimental data proved to be too inaccurate to determine the kinetics unambiguously. Numerical determination of the kinetics parameters resulted in a better description of the data. Two models were fitted to a set of <b>degradation</b> <b>curves</b> of virgin-PVC. Both models showed good reproducibility. The effects of addition of water vapour to the atmosphere were limited to very high temperatures. The <b>degradation</b> <b>curves</b> of rigid PVC-waste showed an additional mass loss between 950 and 1150 K, presumably caused by limestone conversion. The model proposed to describe the degradation of rigid PVC-waste fitted the experimental curves well.

This test substance exhibited a rapid initial degradation reaching its maximum (of 97.1 %), at which point the <b>degradation</b> <b>curve</b> plateaued briefly before beginning to slowly decrease.

One of the laboratories suggested that FAS may have shown some initial toxic effects at the tested concentration as the degradation of the toxicity controls were significantly lower than the test substance alone. However, the FAS degradation levels were sufficiently high to suggest that the anaerobic degradation of the test material had not been significantly affected after 60 days.|$|E

Although TRC has been expansively researched, the formalization of experimental methods concerning durability arises when attempting to implement and design such innovative building materials. In this study, accelerated ageing tests paired with tensile tests were performed. The change in physico-mechanical properties of various commercially available textile reinforcements was documented and evaluated. The ability for the reinforcements to retain their tensile capacity was also quantified in the form of empirical <b>degradation</b> <b>curves.</b> It was observed that accelerated test parameters typically applied to fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) bars and grids are generally too aggressive for the textile reinforcement products and alternative boundary conditions are necessary.

30|$|For {{practical}} considerations the AnBUSDiC {{test has}} a fixed time span of 21 days for phase 1. It {{could be that}} in some cases 21 days are too short to reach the plateau phase (see for example Figure 4, there a linear increase in the <b>degradation</b> <b>curve</b> is observed between days 21 - 28). In this case application of equation 2, i.e. neglecting of TOC 1, would result in a potential overestimation of the degradation rate in phase 2. The magnitude of this potential overestimation can be estimated by comparing the degradation rate deduced from the test substance <b>degradation</b> <b>curve</b> at the end of phase 1 and the extrapolated degradation rate when the plateau phase would be reached: the potential overestimation is given by the difference of these two degradation rates. The degree of potential overestimation can be reduced by prolonging the time before the second addition of test substance. However, we believe that 21 days is a good compromise.|$|E
