5|$|In the {{build up}} to the World Cup Charlton gave out first caps to Gary Kelly, Phil Babb and Jason McAteer; he had {{difficulty}} convincing McAteer to join Ireland as he first had to turn down an approach by the FA {{to play for the}} England under-21s. He scheduled difficult matches before the tournament and Ireland picked up positive results by beating both the Netherlands and Germany away from home. Ireland opened the group stage of the tournament by beating Italy 1–0 at the Giants Stadium, Ray Houghton scoring the winning goal on 11 minutes. They then fell to a 2–1 defeat to Mexico at the Florida Citrus Bowl Stadium, during which Charlton had a pitch-side argument with an official who was preventing substitute John Aldridge (who went on to score the consolation goal) from taking the pitch minutes after his teammate Tommy Coyne had left the pitch and sat <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench.</b> For his arguing, Charlton was suspended by FIFA for the final group game against Norway, and had to watch from the commentary box as Ireland qualified with a 0–0 draw. They faced the Netherlands in the Round of 16; Dennis Bergkamp put the Dutch ahead on 11 minutes after Marc Overmars took advantage of a mistake by Terry Phelan, and Wim Jonk scored the second and final goal of the game from 30 yards after Packie Bonner fluffed an otherwise routine save. For his achievements Charlton was awarded the Freedom of the City of Dublin in 1994 by Lord Mayor Tomás Mac Giolla, the first Englishman to be given the honour since 1854.|$|E

60|$|Among {{those who}} carry the banner, Green Park has the {{reputation}} of opening its gates earlier than the other parks, and at quarter-past four in the morning, I, and many more, entered Green Park. It was raining again, but they were worn out with the night's walking, and they were <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>benches</b> and asleep at once. Many of the men stretched out full length <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dripping wet grass, and, with the rain falling steadily upon them, were sleeping the sleep of exhaustion.|$|R

60|$|A {{woman came}} out of the house {{carrying}} a baby of about eighteen months in her arms, and sat <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> beneath the window.|$|E

60|$|Ulysses now took a great cake of bees' wax {{and cut it}} up {{into small}} pieces, which he bade his men soften and place in their ears, {{that they might not}} hear that singing. But, as he desired to hear it and yet live, he bade the sailors bind him tightly to the mast with ropes, and they must not unbind him, however much he might implore them to set him free. When all this was done <b>the</b> men sat <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>benches,</b> all orderly, and smote the grey sea with their oars, and the ship rushed along through the clear still water, and came {{opposite}} the island.|$|R
60|$|She darted away, and Clement {{signed to}} Ivinghoe to sit <b>down</b> with him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> under <b>the</b> tree.|$|R
60|$|He glanced {{about it}} with a {{whimsical}} smile. The light was fading rapidly and the orchard was full of soft, creeping shadows and silences. It seemed to wink sleepy eyes of impish enjoyment at his perplexity. He laid <b>the</b> violin bow <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> old <b>bench.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Trouble? Let {{him tell}} till midnight, I shall be well pleased," [...] said Amyas, sitting <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> by him. [...] "Drawer! ale--and a parcel of tobacco." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Mike lets me {{ride the}} white one to water {{when the judge}} isn't round. It's such fun to go jouncing down the lane and back. I do love horses!" [...] cried Bab, bobbing up and <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> blue <b>bench</b> to imitate <b>the</b> motion of white Jenny.|$|R
60|$|For some {{hours the}} songs and romances, so popular at the time, were sung in the various {{languages}} represented <b>on</b> board; then <b>the</b> knights, one by one, went down to their sleeping places, until only the seven knights of the langue of Auvergne, who were to watch the first night, remained on deck. Five of these wrapped themselves in their mantles and lay <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>benches.</b> One of <b>the</b> others descended to the waist, walked along the plank between the lines of sleeping slaves, and took up {{his place in the}} bow, while the other paced up and down the poop, the fall of his footsteps being the only sound to break the silence that reigned throughout the ship.|$|R
60|$|Wulf {{was then}} {{conducted}} by the host to a small chamber upstairs, where there was the luxury of a bed stuffed with straw.

50|$|Cyclamate was {{discovered}} in 1937 at the University of Illinois by graduate student Michael Sveda. Sveda was working in <b>the</b> lab <b>on</b> <b>the</b> synthesis of anti-fever medication.

6000|$|Biddy {{gave up her}} work, {{moving away}} from it to look at it. She came and sat <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> long <b>bench</b> <b>on</b> which Sherringham had placed himself.

6000|$|When Marston {{had gone}} Flora sat <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench.</b> She {{was pale and}} trembled. Wyndham, looking very grim, leaned against the wall. They were {{quiet for a moment}} or two, and then he asked: ...|$|E
6000|$|As the {{locksmith}} put his mug <b>down,</b> empty, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> whence it {{had smiled}} on him before, {{he glanced at}} these articles with a laughing eye, and looking at them with his head a little on one side, as though he would get them all into a focus, said, leaning on his hammer: ...|$|R
60|$|He soon left, {{conscious}} of an unwonted awkwardness in his brother's presence. Hilary watched him {{out through the}} wicket gate, then sat <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> solitary garden <b>bench.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} them, but I {{conjecture}} them. Your friend is in slavery: you will go and release him. But I am unable to talk now."

60|$|He lay <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench,</b> and, tired as he was, he soon fell asleep. The bench was {{a narrow}} one, {{and as he}} slept his arm fell down and hung {{by the side of}} it.|$|E
6000|$|Worry {{seemed to}} be trying to control violent emotion. [...] "Next batter up!" [...] he called, hoarsely, and sat <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench.</b> He was {{breathing}} hard, and beads of sweat stood out on his brow.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell me now, little one," [...] {{continued}} Tom, sitting <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> {{and drawing}} the child gently towards him, [...] "whom are you pocketing all these good things for?--not for yourself, I'm quite sure of that." ...|$|E
50|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century {{increasing}} arrivals of Italian workers invigorated the Lower Herbert District, with many later buying their own farms and bringing their families out from Italy. Again the mango trees in Macrossan Street provided a social meeting venue for the new immigrants, who regularly met under the shady canopies. Older members of the Italian community maintained this tradition for well over 50 years. They are also remembered for displaying extreme pride in their meeting place, sweeping the street clean and free of leaves and mangoes before settling <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>benches</b> installed around <b>the</b> base for lively discussions. These benches were extant by the mid-20th century. Younger members of the community also found a welcome social spot under the mango trees. In the 1950s, after a Saturday night party at the Dance Hall situated between the two hotels, young men and women would spill out onto the street to congregate under the trees before heading home.|$|R
5000|$|The children, {{their four}} adult caretakers and six Soviet prisoners were brought by truck to the Bullenhuser Damm School in the Hamburg suburb of Rothenburgsort. The school {{had been taken}} over by the SS to house prisoners from Neuengamme used to clear rubble from the {{surrounding}} area after Allied bombing raids. The SS evacuated the building around April 11, 1945 leaving a skeleton crew of two SS guards: Ewald Jauch and Johann Frahm and a janitor. They were accompanied by three SS guards (Wilhelm Dreimann, Adolf Speck, and Heinrich Wiehagen), as well as the driver, Hans Friedrich Petersen, and SS physician Alfred Trzebinski. The children as well as others were told they were being taken to Theresienstadt. Upon arriving at the school they were led into the basement. According to one of the SS men present, the children [...] "sat <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>benches</b> all around and were cheerful and happy that they had been for once allowed out of Neuengamme. The children were completely unsuspecting." ...|$|R
60|$|The frugal supper over, <b>the</b> boys laid <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>benches,</b> {{and were}} soon asleep. The next day passed slowly, {{for the band}} were not {{expected}} to return until late at night--perhaps not until the next morning, as the pass where the attack would be made was some fifteen miles off, and the convoy might not pass there {{until late in the}} afternoon. The boys soon made friends with some of the women and children of the place, to whom they told stories of the great cities of the plain, and of the great water which washed the shores of Spain. The greater portion of the Spanish peasantry are incredibly ignorant, and very few of the inhabitants of this village had ever gone beyond the mountains. Walking about in the village, but apparently mixing but very little in the games of the other children, were two little girls, whose gay dress of rich silk seemed strangely out of place in such a spot.|$|R
