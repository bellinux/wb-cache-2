25|$|In 1930 or 1931, the Teachers Training College {{opened in}} Rangoon and Ba Zaw {{was chosen as}} the art {{lecturer}} there. Ba Zaw accepted the position but had to give <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>when</b> he had a stroke while painting at the Shwedagon Pagoda in the year given as 1932. He was unable to handle his duties at the Teachers Training College, and his position there was taken over by San Win. Min Naing also mentions that Ba Zaw became chairman of the Burma Art Club in 1933, adding that Ba Zaw was also forced to give up this position due to his stroke. Min Naing’s 1933 date for Ba Zaw’s selection as chairman of the BAC is at odds with the 1932 date (given by others) of the stroke which severely debilitated him.|$|E
25|$|Muhammad's {{policy in}} the next two years after the battle of Uhud was to prevent as best he could the {{formation}} of alliances against him. Whenever alliances of tribesmen against Medina were formed, he sent out an expedition to break <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> <b>When</b> Muhammad heard of men massing with hostile intentions against Medina, he reacted with severity. One example is the assassination of Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf, a member of the Jewish tribe of Banu Nadir who had gone to Mecca and written poems that had helped rouse the Meccans' grief, anger and desire for revenge after the battle of Badr (see the main article for other reasons for killing of Ka'b given in the historiographical sources). Around a year later, Muhammad expelled the Jewish Banu Nadir from Medina.|$|E

In September 2016, {{discussing}} the eventual end of the series, Tancharoen said, [...] "You always just forge ahead. Until someone tells us to stop, {{we will continue to}} move forward." [...] Jed Whedon added, [...] "There are always ideas {{in the back of your}} mind for how you'd wrap <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>when</b> they say, 'That's it guys,' but we're not there just yet." [...] By May 2017, Bell noted they had [...] "a sense of how we'd like the show to end when it ends. We just need to know when that time is coming so we can build to it properly." [...] Jed Whedon continued, [...] "Our goal is to know ahead of time, because we would love to land the story in a way that's satisfying".|$|E

500|$|The wolf, {{after some}} complaint, agrees {{to this and}} the two proceed through the woods after the prize—all the while the fox {{considers}} how to trick the wolf. Eventually, as the wolf complains of the fruitlessness of their quest, they arrive at a [...] with buckets on each end of a rope. Seeing {{the reflection of the}} moon in the water {{at the bottom of the}} well, the wolf believes there to be cheese down there and lowers the fox down to pick <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> <b>When</b> he complains that it is too heavy for him to lift alone, the wolf jumps into the other bucket and descends to help. However, this pulls up the other bucket, into which the fox has jumped, and so the two swap places; the wolf at the bottom of the well and the fox safely escaped. The narrator professes that he does not know who helped the wolf out of the well, but that the tale is at an end.|$|E

2500|$|Armstrong {{tried to}} revive the plot in April but gave <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>when</b> someone {{revealed}} the plan to Washington. Gates' aide later complained that a [...] "timid wretch discovered it to the only man from whom he was to have kept it". Historian Robert K. Wright Jr. noted that the wretch whom Armstrong referred to was either Stewart or Brooks. Armstrong went on, [...] "to be more explicit he betrayed it to the Commander in Chief - who, agreeably according to the original plan, was {{not to have been}} consulted till some later period". For his part Gates quietly dropped out of the conspiracy.|$|E
2500|$|These small immune {{signaling}} peptides (PRPs) were independently {{discovered in}} colostrum and other sources, such as blood plasma, in the United States, Czechoslovakia and Poland. Hence they appear under various {{names in the}} literature, including Colostrinin, CLN, transfer factor and PRP. [...] They function as signal transducing molecules that have the unique effect of modulating the immune system, turning <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>when</b> the body comes under attack from pathogens or other disease agents, and damping it when the danger is eliminated or neutralized. At first thought to actually transfer immunity from one immune system to another, {{it now appears that}} PRPs simply stimulate cell-mediated immunity.|$|E

2500|$|Ulsterisation was the British Government's {{policy to}} reduce regular Army troop numbers in Northern Ireland and bring local forces {{into the front}} line. This was {{as a result of}} {{international}} opinion about British soldiers being used in what many viewed as a [...] "colonial occupation". It was also called [...] "normalisation", or [...] "police primacy". [...] The term [...] "Ulsterisation" [...] was coined by the media. The then Assistant Chief Constable of the RUC, Jack Hermon, summed <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>when</b> he said, [...] "Ulstermen need to learn to live together and be policed by Ulstermen. If they have to kill, let them kill each other, not English soldiers." ...|$|E
