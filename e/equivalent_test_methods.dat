Claims that domestic dogs are unique in their ability to respond to diverse novel stimuli may be in part due to the absence of data for the same range of gestures in other species.

In order for simulation results to be valid for implementation on real hardware, the accuracy of the simulation model must be verified.

To ensure the validity of the robot models, NIST proposes standardized <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> that can be easily replicated in both computer simulation and physical form.

40|$|AbstractThermal {{vacuum test}} {{is widely used}} for the ground {{validation}} of spacecraft thermal control system. However, the conduction and convection can be simulated in normal ground pressure environment completely. By the employment of pumped fluid loops’ thermal control technology on spacecraft, conduction and convection become the main heat transfer behavior between radiator and inside cabin. As long as the heat transfer behavior between radiator and outer space can be equivalently simulated in normal pressure, the thermal vacuum test can be substituted by the normal ground pressure thermal test. In this paper, an equivalent normal pressure thermal <b>test</b> <b>method</b> for the spacecraft single-phase fluid loop radiator is proposed. The heat radiation between radiator and outer space has been equivalently simulated by combination {{of a group of}} refrigerators and thermal electrical cooler (TEC) array. By adjusting the heat rejection of each device, the relationship between heat flux and surface temperature of the radiator can be maintained. To verify this method, a validating system has been built up and the experiments have been carried out. The results indicate that the proposed <b>equivalent</b> ground thermal <b>test</b> <b>method</b> can simulate the heat rejection performance of radiator correctly and the temperature error between in-orbit theory value and experiment result of the radiator is less than 0. 5 °C, except for the equipment startup period.

Force, velocity and power patterns were averaged over the push-off phase using accelerometry, linear position transducer and a method based on key positions measurements during squat jump, and compared to force plate measurements. Concurrent validity analyses indicated very good agreement with the reference method (CV= 6. 4 – 14. 5 %). Force, velocity and power patterns comparison confirmed the agreement with slight differences for high-velocity movements. The validity of measurements was <b>equivalent</b> for all <b>tested</b> <b>methods</b> (r= 0. 87 – 0. 98). Bland-Altman plots showed a lower agreement for velocity and power compared to force.
