40|$|Background: Despite the {{mounting}} attention for <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> and <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> theories, {{there is a}} persisting lack of consensus on their conceptualisation and strengthening. This paper contributes to structuring the debate, presenting landmarks {{in the development of}} <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> thinking {{against the backdrop of the}} policy context and its dominant actors.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{increasing}} attention for <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> research in the world, including in lowand middle income countries, with recent developments {{both in terms of}} its definition, and in the evolution of theory and methodologies. In 2011, a team from the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM), Antwerp was tasked by the Alliance for <b>Health</b> Policy and <b>Systems</b> Research to map <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> research capacity, <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> research undertaken and policy uptake of this research in a number of low-and middle income countries. Using an innovative and cost-efficient approach, the team drew on winners of a 2010 essay competition (Emerging Voices) linked to the First Global Symposium on <b>Health</b> <b>Systems</b> Research and ITM alumni to conduct interviews with senior <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> researchers, high-level policy makers and policy brokers in 26 LMICs. Their narratives and stories provide insight into how these three categories within the research-policy continuum conceptualize <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> research, interpret their roles, assess the <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> research capacity in their country as well as the scope of <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> research undertaken, and assess potential policy uptake. <b>Health</b> <b>systems</b> research as an emergent discipline in these contexts is dependent on a cluster of enabling factors, identified in this research: charismatic and strategically thinking individuals with a talent for networking, technical competence and scientific credibility, appropriate international alliances and trends, emergent local knowledge translation structures and increasing national ownership of research agendas, more and better training courses for researchers as well as workshops for decision makers to make them more attuned to each others’ world and constraints, increasing trust between decision makers and researchers, a critical mass of <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> researchers and competing institutions ‘able to deliver’, an entry point for <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> research in decision making circles, sufficient domestic and international funding, and even political transitions, shock events or other windows of opportunity. However, country contexts diverge widely. Where this critical set of enabling factors has not yet been established, <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> research remains undeveloped; nevertheless, in most LMIC countries studied, <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> research appears to be gaining momentum, and its potential for informing policy is increasing...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of strengthening <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> has {{gained increased attention}} in recent years, {{and there have been}} renewed calls for a focus on <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> as part and parcel of meeting the health related Millennium Development Goals.

The divergence in opinion on what constitutes <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> strengthening and the scarcity of rigorous evaluations of various approaches undermine efforts to focus on <b>health</b> <b>systems</b> as a means of improving population health.
