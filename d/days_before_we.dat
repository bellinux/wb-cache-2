25|$|I think I thought I {{could handle}} things. Didn't {{know how to}} shoot music. Music had been {{important}} in my films, it was usually post production. This was tough stuff to shoot. I already had a great respect for people like Minnelli. I just couldn't seem {{to work it out}} without just putting up multiple cameras and shooting an awful lot of film... I later realized or talked to people about this and MGM in the old days everybody was on contract and they would rehearse for weeks. We don't get that. We would stage it and shoot it. We got the songs a lot of times just a few <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> shoot. We only get the final song. The structural advantage of the old studio system we didn't have. It made a very inefficient shoot. I don't think there was any other way to do it given the circumstances.|$|E
500|$|Osbourne {{initially}} {{set out to}} form a solo project featuring former Dirty Tricks members John Frazer-Binnie, Terry Horbury, and Andy Bierne. As the new band were in rehearsals in January 1978, Osbourne had {{a change}} of heart and rejoined Black Sabbath. [...] "Three <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> were due to go into the studio, Ozzy wanted to come back to the band", Iommi explained. [...] "He wouldn't sing any of the stuff we'd written with the other guy (Walker), so it made it very difficult. We went into the studio with basically no songs. We'd write in the morning so we could rehearse and record at night. It was so difficult, like a conveyor belt, because you couldn't get time to reflect on stuff. 'Is this right? Is this working properly?' It was very difficult for me to come up with the ideas and putting them together that quick." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{remember}} that in 1934 the little Ruth accident happened. <b>Days</b> <b>before,</b> <b>we</b> argued a little because I easily gave up the leading part of Yehuda Maccabi in the school show {{and the son of}} the headmaster got it. She argued that I had to fight more and not to give up immediately".|$|E
6000|$|... "Not exactly. He came to {{our house}} begging--the <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> left home," [...] {{answered}} the smaller member of the club, in a whisper.|$|R
6000|$|... "He was. Mr. Appleby, our manager, {{took him}} on the <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> went on the trip. I don't know where Mr. Appleby met him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I fancy we {{have seen}} him, for the <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> picked you up we saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have a box {{or two for}} you, madam, in {{addition}} to your brother's kit. Mr. Bale sent them down, a couple of <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> sailed.|$|E
6000|$|... "It'll be <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> {{can take}} off," [...] Fomar said. [...] "We should keep every man working here. We can't afford {{to send out}} a party." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess that's sufficient. Come {{right back}} with us to 'Frisco and we'll have a few off <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> start you. This is no country for a live man, anyway." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Something that {{happened}} the <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> left Venice. You saw the Countess, {{during the last}} hours of her life. Won't you tell me whether she made any confession to you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The valley would guide us. We {{could do}} {{four hours a}} <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> had to camp. I'm not sure we couldn't try the river. We could drag and carry all our food...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor fellow!" [...] said Henri, [...] "if {{adversity}} {{will teach}} him, {{he is likely}} to get his lesson now. Did he part quietly with you, Agatha, on the <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> started to Saumur?" ...|$|R
60|$|In {{obedience}} {{to his own}} earnest request, though sorely against the feelings of my wife and daughters, I buried the body of my old friend in the ocean, six <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> made the land.|$|E
6000|$|... "To-morrow {{night at}} Portsmouth," [...] he replied. [...] "I'm afraid {{we shall be}} several <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> are at work. It's the Scorpion they're giving me, Gerald--or the mystery ship, {{as they call it}} in the navy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have not}} cleaned up yet; we shall let it run {{for three or}} four <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> do. We are only on the surface yet, and the stuff wouldn't pay for the trouble of washing out." ...|$|E
6000|$|My friend came in {{the other}} <b>day,</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> had left town, and looked round at the {{appointments}} of the room in their summer shrouds, and said, with a faint sigh, [...] "I see you have had the eternal-womanly with you, too." ...|$|R
60|$|I was too drowsy {{and cold}} to answer, {{and how we}} got the team into the stables or even found Fairmead I do not remember; but we {{probably}} did it by force of habit, and it was high noon the next <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> awakened.|$|R
6000|$|... "And we {{will send}} the baby {{down the last}} <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> go to Ryde, with Preston and Butts {{to take care of}} her. We can't spare him to take them down, till we shut up the house. It is so much easier for us to go to Portsmouth from hence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We amuse {{ourselves}} with thinking how she gets on with Arnaud,' said Guy. 'Their introduction took place only two <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> were married, since which, {{they have had}} one continued tete-a-tete, which must have been droll at first.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And God {{give all}} generals such a head as yours! Come, Frank Drake, we'll {{play the game}} out before we move. It will be two good <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> shall be fit to tackle them, so an odd half-hour don't matter." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was another}} two <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> {{were ready to}} limp along, half repaired. The night before the repairs were completed, the sentry came {{to my room and}} awoke me. He was rather an {{intelligent}} fellow of the English middle class, in whom I had much confidence.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} as well as you. I saw you sneak out just the <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> did. But you didn't escape me, ha! ha! You are too good to live, my man. Stand aside here till I call someone who's not quite so frightened. Here, hold him, one of you! Bring another!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{did what}} we could for the boy. In fact, it rather broke up the {{prospecting}} trip, {{but he was too}} far gone. He hung for a week or two, and one of us brought a doctor out from the settlements, but the <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> broke camp Jake and I buried him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I have a {{thing in}} my knife that will do for that, sir,” Joyce said; and he {{produced}} from his pocket a knife with many blades, one of them being a long pricker. “It {{was given to me}} the <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> sailed, and I have always wondered what use that thing could ever be. Here is a use for it at last.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The {{unbroken}} flatness of {{the banks}} of the Mississippi continued unvaried for many miles above New Orleans; but the graceful and luxuriant palmetto, the dark and noble ilex, and the bright orange, were everywhere to be seen, and it was many <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> were weary of looking at them.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Truly you {{say what}} is true. It will be easy to find and follow the trail of a whole tribe," [...] {{returned}} Nazinred, with a smile. [...] "But it is disappointing to find that they have forsaken the old place, {{and it may be}} many <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> find them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not much," [...] he said, [...] "not much. We {{will be able}} to find at Spanish Town {{something}} braver in the way of apparel {{than anything}} you now possess. It will be some <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> sail, and I shall have quietly conveyed on board such belongings as you need." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{travelled}} {{two days}} towards those hills, and still they seemed as far off {{as they did}} at first, {{and it was the}} fifth <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> got to them; indeed, we travelled but softly, for it was excessively hot; and we were much about the very equinoctial line, we hardly knew whether to the south or the north of it.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was signed}} by the governor's aide-de-camp as secretary, and bore the king's seal. In other words, it was a direct command from General Gage to the officer at the Bridewell to deliver over {{any one of the}} {{prisoner}}s taken at Breed's hill which Job Lord might point out, and, what is more, was dated the very <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> made a prisoner of this double-dyed villain! ...|$|R
5000|$|... “Major Dade, {{with seven}} {{officers}} and 110 men, started the <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> arrived, for Fort King. We were all prepared to overtake them the next day….when an intervention of circumstances deferred {{it for one}} day-and {{in the course of}} that day, three soldiers, horribly mangled, came into camp, and brought the melancholy tidings that Major Dade, and every officer and man, except themselves, were murdered and terribly mangled.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Leonard," [...] she implored, [...] "if {{you care}} for me at all, be quiet. Father will turn round {{directly}} and I can't bear it. I shall be your very faithful friend; I shall think of you through the long <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> meet again, but don't--don't spoil this last evening." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{not many}} <b>days</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> {{came to know}} that there was a plan on foot, laid by these two men who should have been working {{for the good of the}} colony instead of to further their own base ends, to seize upon our pinnace, which lay moored to the shore, and to sail in her to England.|$|E
60|$|THESE events {{occupied}} so much time, that June had numbered {{more than}} half its <b>days,</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> again commenced our long-protracted journey. The day after my return to Versailles, six men, from among those I had left at Villeneuve-la-Guiard, arrived, with intelligence, {{that the rest of the}} troop had already proceeded towards Switzerland. We went forward in the same track.|$|E
6000|$|Really and truly, {{two thirds}} of the talk of drivers and {{conductors}} had been about this man Slade, ever since the <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> reached Julesburg. In order that the eastern reader may have a clear conception of what a Rocky Mountain desperado is, in his highest state of development, I will reduce all this mass of overland gossip to one straightforward narrative, and present it in the following shape: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It must be that. I rowled {{it up in}} an owld leather coat {{bought from}} an Injin the <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> left the diggin's. It's but a small {{remainder}} o' me fortune--a thousand pounds, more or less,--but sure, it's found money an comes handy this good day, which reminds me I've got some noose for 'ee. What d'ee think, cap'n?" [...] continued O'Rook, with a very conscious look.|$|R
6000|$|... "The <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> started," [...] {{the doctor}} said, [...] "I saw {{in one of}} the Durban papers a {{telegram}} from Lorenzo Marques saying that there had been an explosion at Komati-poort, where a few waggons had been injured and two natives killed, but that the Boers had suffered in any way, and that the damage would be repaired and the line opened for traffic in a few hours." ...|$|R
