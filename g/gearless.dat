In 1906 it produced, using the Auto-Mixte patents of Belgian Henri Pieper, a petrol-electric vehicle and on 23 May 1906 registered <b>Gearless</b> Motor Omnibus Co. Limited. It was too heavy.

The KPL bus had four-wheel brakes and steel unitary body/chassis construction. Failure to produce the KPL set bus design back twenty years.|$|E
25|$|Ecotècnia, {{established}} 1981, and by 2005 had 2.1% {{world market}} share by installed capacity, with wind turbines in production {{of up to}} 1.6MW. In 2009 the company was acquired by Alstom for €350million. The company continued to develop wind turbines; a 3MW machine was installed in a commercial windfarm in 2009. In 2010 the company was renamed Alstom Wind. In 2011/2 the company developed a prototype 6MW permanent magnet <b>gearless</b> generator for offshore applications, in association with LM Wind Power and Converteam.|$|E
25|$|Ennore Port was {{originally}} {{conceived as a}} satellite port to the Chennai Port, primarily to handle thermal coal to meet the requirement of Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) and was endowed with large chunks of land (about 2,000 acres). The scope was expanded taking into account subsequent developments such as the plan of Government of Tamil Nadu {{to set up a}} 1,880mW LNG power project in association with a private consortium, a large petrochemical park and a naphtha cracker plant. Ennore Port was commissioned by the then Prime Minister of India Sh. Atal Bihari Vajpayee on 1 February 2001. The port was set up under the Companies Act, keeping it outside the scope of the Tariff Authority for Major Ports, the tariff regulator for 11 of the 12 ports owned by the Indian government. The port was declared as a major port under the Indian Ports Act, 1908 in March 1999 and incorporated as the Ennore Port Limited under the Companies Act, 1956 in October 1999. Commercial operations commenced with Handymax geared vessels for unloading of thermal coal on 22 June 2001. With the deployment of self-unloading and <b>gearless</b> vessels of 65,000/77,000 dead weight tonnage (DWT), full-fledged operations were started in December 2002.|$|E
500|$|Until 1961 the {{lighthouse}} was administered as a shore station, and subsequently (after the resident population of Stroma had left) {{as a rock}} station. An electric lamp with a maximum power of 1.1 million cp was installed in 1972, utilising a sealed beam optic mounted on a <b>gearless</b> revolving pedestal. By this time the keepers and their families {{were the only people}} living on Stroma. A helicopter pad was installed to enable supplies and personnel to be flown in. In 1997 the station was converted to automatic operation, utilising a 250 watt metal halide lamp which rotates on a <b>gearless</b> pedestal. A lens system from Sule Skerry lighthouse was refitted in the Stroma lighthouse. The old air-driven fog horn was removed and replaced by an electric fog signal which is installed on the balcony of {{the lighthouse}}. The lighthouse station's power, which was formerly obtained from generators, is now provided by batteries which are charged at regular intervals. The current light flashes white every 20 seconds and can be seen from a nominal range of [...]|$|E

[...] of retail space {{is on the}} underground concourse while the rest {{is located on the}} street level. The building features high ceilings with some floors having a ceiling height of [...] The lower floors {{on the south side of}} the building feature four three-story stacked atrias. The building also features a 500-seat concourse level dining court and an 87-space private underground parking garage. ThyssenKrupp provided the building's 30 <b>gearless</b> elevators, seven hydraulic elevators, and two escalators.|$|E
2500|$|A {{proposed}} alternate way {{to distribute}} {{power to the}} wheels, {{is to use the}} concept of a <b>gearless</b> differential, about which a review has been reported by Provatidis, but the various configurations seem to correspond either to the [...] "sliding pins and cams" [...] type, such as the ZF B-70 available on early VWs, or are a variation of the ball differential.|$|E
2500|$|The {{traction}} motors by Siemens were series-wound [...] <b>gearless</b> motors on the axles. The trains ran in a formation of four cars, the two outer vehicles being motor coaches. [...] The motor cars were constructed to allow an early form of multiple unit operation {{and the front}} car's controller was additionally {{able to control the}} rear car's motors. [...] The two motors at each end were connected in series at starting, then reconnected in parallel (using open circuit transition) as the train accelerated in the well established (at that time) method. [...] This required eight cables to be run the length of the train at roof level. [...] A further cable making nine in all linked the collector shoes at opposite ends of the four-car set to avoid problems with the large gaps in the centrally mounted conductor rail.|$|E
2500|$|The tower has thirty two lifts for tenants to use, where 8 lifts serve roughly ten {{floors of}} the building. All tenant {{passenger}} lifts serve the ground floor and the following groups of floors – floors 5–17, floors 18–28, floors 28–39 and floors 39–50 (note that level 5 is the first office floor {{and there is no}} level 13). In addition there are 2 firemen's lifts which serve all floors in the building. These have colour designations with blue being in the northeast core of the building and green being in the southwest. From the building's initial construction until late 2009 there were 2 large freight lifts at which point another was added. This lift was built inside a vacant lift shaft and has the designation GL37 (GL for goods lift and 37 as it is the 37th lift in the building). The tower uses 'Gearless Traction Elevators' by Otis. [...] These lifts were installed in 1990 (aside from GL37 – 2009) using a <b>gearless</b> traction machine. [...] They have woven steel cables called hoisting ropes that are attached {{to the top of the}} lift cabin and wrapped around the drive sheave in special grooves. The other ends of the cables are attached to a counterweight that moves up and down in the hoistway on its own guiderails. It takes 40 seconds by lift from lobby to top floor (The Canary Wharf website has not been updated to include the new goods lift GL37).|$|E
5000|$|The first, [...] 10001, used <b>gearless</b> motors {{attached}} to the axles. The second, [...] 10002, was built with motors mounted in the truck frames and geared to the wheels. Later on it was given one <b>gearless</b> truck.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Gearless</b> wind {{turbines}} (also called direct drive) {{get rid of}} the gearbox completely. Instead, the rotor shaft is attached directly to the generator, which spins at the same speed as the blades. Enercon and EWT (formerly known as Lagerwey) have produced <b>gearless</b> {{wind turbines}} with separately electrically excited generators for many years, and Siemens produces a <b>gearless</b> [...] "inverted generator" [...] 3 MW model while developing a 6 MW model. To make up for a direct drive generator's slower spinning rate, the diameter of the generator's rotor is increased so that it can contain more magnets to create the required frequency and power.|$|E

5000|$|A major {{characteristic}} of a container ship is whether it has cranes installed for handling its cargo. Those that have cargo cranes are called geared and those that don't are called ungeared or <b>gearless.</b> The earliest purpose-built container ships in the 1970s were all <b>gearless.</b> [...] Since then, the percentage of geared newbuilds has fluctuated widely, but has been decreasing overall, with only 7.5% of the container ship capacity in 2009 being equipped with cranes.|$|E
