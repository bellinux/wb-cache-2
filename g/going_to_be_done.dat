5|$|Lighting and {{its effect}} on characters' skin was of {{particular}} importance to the Business Division 2 team, with a lot of work going into making sure shading and transparency fitted with each character's position in a scene in relation to its lighting. Previsualization was initially <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> entirely in-house, but the team eventually decided to bring in The Third Floor, an external company specializing in previsualization. The Third Floor ended up handling around 40% of the work. The animation was also supposed to be handled in-house using the V-Ray software, but the team found it difficult to adapt the software to their needs. As Nozue wanted to use the experience and technology of Visual Works to create Kingsglaive, they decided to bring in experienced and dedicated outside help to handle V-Ray. This resulted in the cooperation with Digic Pictures, which included former staff from Square Enix's North American branch and were highly skilled in the creation of high-quality cutscenes. For procedural environmental elements such as falling rubble, they used the Houdini animation software.|$|E

"I don't {{know if we}} ever {{released}} an official reason on why [...] was canceled, but in a nutshell, the game was canceled {{because it was not}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> in time to get Interplay the revenue the company needed to continue operations. That sounds like it was all Interplay's fault, but that's really not the case. The project was not going well and continued to be an ongoing challenge." ...|$|E
500|$|Laws {{should be}} [...] "prospective, open and clear". The {{meaning of the}} law should not be [...] "ambiguous, vague, obscure or imprecise", and the law must be {{sufficiently}} publicized.

5000|$|Hartnett {{described}} her menu as having Mediterranean influences {{due to her}} Italian roots.

[...] Prior to taking over the kitchen, she went on a culinary tour of Spain, France, Italy and the United States in order to find inspiration for the new menu. Whilst it was officially described as serving Modern European cuisine, some food critics claimed that it was serving Italian cuisine, whilst others thought it was French style Haute cuisine.|$|R

500|$|Despite {{his many}} accomplishments, the event for which Ward is most remembered {{is the game}} he did not play. In 1934, Michigan had {{scheduled}} Georgia Tech as the third game of the season. After learning that Michigan had an African-American player, Georgia Tech football coach and athletic director W. A. [...] "Bill" [...] Alexander refused to allow his team to take the field if Ward played. [...] As early as the fall of 1933, Alexander wrote to Yost asking what was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> about Ward, asserting that his team would not take the field if Ward played.|$|E

The animators added the wraparound at the beginning to set Bart against the crowd and put the video in [...] "some sort of context." ...|$|E
500|$|Paul McCartney said {{he came up}} {{with the}} title [...] "The Long and Winding Road" [...] during one of his first visits to his {{property}} High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road [...] "stretching up into the hills" [...] in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction his personal life was taking in the autumn of 1968, after he had separated from his fiancée Jane Asher, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: [...] "I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{contained}} several elaborate stunts {{and effect}} sequences. Gish performed {{all of her}} stunts in the episode, including one shot when she jumped from a thirty-foot descender. She later called the sequence [...] "the biggest stunt of my career." [...] For several of the special effect shots, Manners was forced to compromise on his original decision. One specific shot, wherein Audrey Pauley had to disappear after appearing in front of Gish, was originally <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> via CGI. Eventually, Manners decided to [...] "tie the two actresses [...] together [...] and then you [...] to Annabeth and in her face there's an 'oh shit' reaction, and then [...] straight up on a crane, all right, and see that she's completely alone." [...] He called effects like these [...] "creative ways to trim [...] budget." [...] To create the floating hospital scene, a small door set was merged with a CGI hospital. Initially, the scene used a straight flat [...] "piece of cement" [...] as {{the bottom of the}} building. The effects team tried adding a [...] "big piece of earth" [...] under the building, but Paul Rabwin felt it looked too much like The Little Prince, so the piece of earth was removed. The final result also removed the cement-like base.|$|E

[...] The album featured a re-recorded version of their contribution to the Sympathetic Sounds compilation, [...] "I'm Through With White Girls" [...] written and sung by Jim Diamond. The single [...] "Motor City Baby" [...] was featured on Little Steven's Underground Garage as the [...] "Coolest Song in the World".|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, C-SPAN {{planned to}} cover Dr. Lipstadt's {{book on the}} trial, History on Trial: My Day in Court with David Irving via its Book TV programme, but the cable network was heavily criticized when it was {{revealed}} that they had planned to put together a de facto debate between Dr. Lipstadt and Irving, by airing a new speech by Irving that they'd arranged with him to videotape, after an older one by Lipstadt (the network claimed this was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> for [...] "balance"); when Lipstadt told C-SPAN she would not appear on the show under those circumstances, C-SPAN originally told her they would air Irving's speech by itself, but C-SPAN ended up cancelling this planned programme and instead aired a special that focused on how the trial was viewed by Washington Post reporter T. R. Reid and included clips of both Lipstadt and Irving.|$|E

2500|$|The {{league is}} also honoring {{the memory of}} NFLPA leader Gene Upshaw, who died {{suddenly}} at age 63 on August 20 just three days after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. For the entire season, the Oakland Raiders are wearing a patch on the left chest of the jerseys with the initials [...] "GU" [...] and his number 63, his jersey number with the Raiders. All NFL teams also honored Upshaw with a video tribute and {{a replica of the}} uniform patch painted onto the field during the opening weekend. Originally, the patch on the field and the video tribute were only <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> in Oakland at the Raiders' home opener against the Denver Broncos as Upshaw played his entire 15-year Hall of Fame career with the Silver and Black, and at Giants Stadium, when the Giants and Redskins opened the NFL season on September 4. All players wore the same patch during Week One, and have since changed to a smaller helmet decal. The Raiders wore the patch through the remainder of the season.|$|E
2500|$|Newborn {{screening}} debuted as {{a public}} health program in the United States in the early 1960s, and has expanded to countries around the world, with different testing menus in each country. Both prenatal screening (screening before birth) and newborn screening (screening soon after birth) have improved health care. The first disorder detected by modern newborn screening programs was phenylketonuria, a metabolic condition in which the inability to degrade the essential amino acid phenylalanine can cause irreversible mental retardation unless detected early. [...] With early detection and dietary management, the negative effects of the disease can be largely eliminated. [...] Robert Guthrie developed a simple method using a bacterial inhibition assay that could detect high levels of phenylalanine in blood shortly after a baby was born. [...] Guthrie also pioneered the collection of blood on filter paper which could be easily transported, recognizing the need for a simple system if the screening was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> on a large scale. [...] Newborn screening around the world is still done using similar filter paper.|$|E
