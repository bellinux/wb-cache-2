These systems transfer heat to a secondary heat exchanger via the essential service water system, using water pumped out to sea or an onsite cooling tower. Units 2 and 3 were equipped with steam turbine-driven <b>emergency</b> <b>core</b> <b>cooling</b> systems that could be directly operated by steam produced by decay heat, and which could inject water directly into the reactor.

ECCS piping is integrated with the normal reactor cooling system.

The Chernobyl disaster occurred during a botched test of this system. The ECCS has three systems, connected to the coolant system headers. In case of damage, the first ECCS subsystem provides cooling for up to 100 seconds to the damaged half of the coolant circuit (the other half is cooled by the main circulation pumps), and the other two subsystems then handle long-term cooling of the reactor.|$|E

The limiting factor in many industries is the maximum operating temperature and/or the maximum heat flux to be dissipated from the surface. Liquid Jet Impinging Cooling (LJIC) {{is one of the}} most effective cooling means because of its high heat transfer coefficient. LJIC is extensively used in steel quenching, electronic chips <b>cooling</b> and <b>emergency</b> rapid <b>core</b> <b>cooling</b> in nuclear reactors. Though, the surface heat flux has no straight forward formula. The present study adapts the mechanistic modeling approach to quantify the surface heat flux under different conditions. The mechanistic model assumes that the heat is transferred from the surface through multiple mechanisms, namely: boiling, forced convection and transient conduction. The total wall heat flux is calculated as the algebraic sum of these different heat flux components. The boiling heat transfer component depends on bubbles behaviour on the surface (bubble dynamics). Bubble growth rate, departure diameter, release frequency and number of bubbles on the surface are the major bubble dynamics parameters that are affected by the jet. This paper presents the result of an experimental investigation of bubble dynamics under a planar water jet. The experimental data are collected using high speed imaging of the boiling process at different degrees of superheating. Results reported here are for a 0. 85 m/s jet. The jet was found to suppress nucleation close to the impinging zone and deform growing bubble from the spherical shaper. Away from stagnation, bubble diameter was found to depend on the square root of growth time, i. e. D~tg^ 1 / 2 cf 201...|$|R

Most of the insights regarding {{the response of the}} AP 600 safety systems to the postulated accident are derived from calculations performed with the TRAC-PFl/MOD 2 code. However, complementary insights derived from a scaled experiment conducted in the ROSA facility, as well as insights based upon calculations by other codes, are also presented.

40|$|Sub-Neptune {{planets are}} {{very common in}} our galaxy and show a large {{diversity}} in their mass-radius relation. In sub-Neptunes most of the planet mass is in the rocky part (hereafter core) which {{is surrounded by a}} modest hydrogen-helium envelope. As a result, the total initial heat content of such a planet is dominated by that of the core. Nonetheless, most studies contend that the <b>core</b> <b>cooling</b> will only have a minor effect on the radius evolution of the gaseous envelope, because the <b>core's</b> <b>cooling</b> is in sync with the envelope, i. e., most of the initial heat is released early on timescales of about 10 - 100 Myr. In this Letter we examine the importance of the <b>core</b> <b>cooling</b> rate for the thermal evolution of the envelope. Thus, we relax the early <b>core</b> <b>cooling</b> assumption and present a model where the core is characterized by two parameters: the initial temperature and the cooling time. We find that <b>core</b> <b>cooling</b> can significantly enhance the radius of the planet when it operates on a timescale similar to the observed age, i. e. several Gyr. Consequently, the interpretation of sub-Neptunes' mass-radius observations depends on the assumed core thermal properties and the uncertainty therein. The degeneracy of composition and core thermal properties can be reduced by obtaining better estimates of the planet ages (in addition to their radii and masses) as envisioned by future observations.

From 19972007 the Byron plant has received five such actions, two of which resulted in a total of $150,000 in fines. A $100,000 fine was issued on February 27, 1997 due to problems with excessive silt build up in two separate locations at the Byron facility; the NRC fined the plant $50,000 for each problem.

The resulting pressure increase inside the containment, which is designed to withstand the pressure, triggers containment sprays ("dousing sprays") to turn on to condense the steam and thus reduce the pressure. A SCRAM ("neutronic trip") initiates very shortly after the break occurs.

2500|$|As the {{pressure}} in the primary system continued to decrease, reactor coolant continued to flow, but it was boiling inside the core. First, small bubbles of steam formed and immediately collapsed, known as nucleate boiling. As the system pressure decreased further, steam pockets began to form in the reactor coolant. This {{departure from nucleate boiling}} (DNB) into the regime of [...] "film boiling" [...] caused steam voids in coolant channels, blocking the flow of liquid coolant and greatly increasing the fuel cladding temperature. The overall water level inside the pressurizer was rising despite the loss of coolant through the open pilot-operated relief valve, as the volume of these steam voids increased much more quickly than coolant was lost. Because of the lack of a dedicated instrument to measure the level of water in the core, operators judged the level of water in the core solely by the level in the pressurizer. Since it was high, they assumed that the core was properly covered with coolant, unaware that because of steam forming in the reactor vessel, the indicator provided misleading readings. Indications of high water levels contributed to the confusion, as operators were concerned about the primary loop [...] "going solid," [...] (i.e. no steam pocket buffer existing in the pressurizer) which in training they had been instructed to never allow. This confusion was a key contributor to the initial failure to recognize the accident as a loss-of-coolant accident, and led operators to turn off the <b>emergency</b> <b>core</b> <b>cooling</b> pumps, which had automatically started after the pilot-operated relief valve stuck and core coolant loss began, due to fears the system was being overfilled.|$|E

Repeated cooling episodes lowered body core temperature by 1. 3 – 3. 1 °C, and this independently activated tail sympathetic fibre activity, in a graded fashion, below a threshold rectal temperature of 38. 4 ± 0. 2 °C.
