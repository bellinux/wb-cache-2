40|$|Purpose: We {{studied the}} {{influence}} of using plugs for brainstem protection during gamma knife radiosurgery (GKR) of trigeminal neuralgia (TN), with special emphasis on irradiation doses delivered to the trigeminal nerve, pain outcomes, and incidence of trigeminal dysfunction. Methods and Materials: A GKR procedure for TN using an anterior cisternal target and a maximum dose of 90 Gy was performed in 109 patients. For 49 patients, customized beam channel blocking (plugs) were used to reduce the dose delivered to the brainstem. We measured the mean and <b>integrated</b> <b>radiation</b> <b>doses</b> delivered to the trigeminal nerve and the clinical course of patients treated with and without plugs. Results: We found that blocking increases the length of trigeminal nerve exposed to high-dose radiation, resulting in a significantly higher mean dose to the trigeminal nerve. Significantly more of the patients with blocking achieved excellent pain outcomes (84 % vs. 62 %), but with higher incidences of moderate and bothersome trigeminal nerve dysfunction (37 % mild/ 10 % bothersome with plugs vs. 30 % mild/ 2 % bothersome without). Conclusions: The use of plugs to protect the brainstem during GKR treatment for TN increases the dose of irradiation delivered to the intracisternal trigeminal nerve root and is associated with an important increase {{in the incidence of}} trigeminal nerve dysfunction. Therefore, beam channel blocking should be avoided for 90 Gy-GKR of TN. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|The physics {{program of}} Run II at the Tevatron {{includes}} precision electroweak measurements {{such as the}} determination of the top quark and W boson masses; bottom and charm physics including {{the determination of the}} B{sub s} and D{sup 0 } mixing parameters; studies of the strong interaction; and searches for the Higgs particle, supersymmetric particles, hidden space-time dimensions and quark substructure. All of these measurements benefit from a high-resolution tracking detector. Most of them rely heavily on the efficient identification of heavy flavored B hadrons by detection of displaced secondary vertices, and are enhanced by the capability to trigger on tracks not coming from the primary vertex. This is uniquely provided by CDF's finely-segmented silicon detectors surrounding the interaction region. Thus CDF experiment's physics potential critically depends on the performance of its silicon detectors. The CDF silicon detectors were designed to operate up to 2 - 3 fb{sup - 1 } of accumulated pji collisions, with an upgrade planned thereafter. However, the upgrade project was canceled in 2003 and Run II has been extended through 2011, with an expected total delivered integrated luminosity of 12 fb{sup - 1 } or more. Several preventive measures were taken to keep the original detector operational and maintain its performance. The most important of these are the decrease in the operating temperature of the detector, which reduces the impact of radiation exposure, and measures to minimize damage due to <b>integrated</b> <b>radiation</b> <b>dose,</b> thermal cycles, and wire bond resonance conditions. Despite these measures the detectors operating conditions continue to change with issues arising from radiation damage to the sensors, aging infrastructure and electronics.

40|$|This {{material}} {{represents a}} breakthrough in the production, manufacturing, and application of thermal protection system (TPS) materials and radiation shielding, as this represents the first effort to develop a non-metallic, non-ceramic, biomaterial-based, sustainable TPS with the capability to also act as radiation shielding. Until now, the standing philosophy for radiation shielding involved carrying the shielding at liftoff or utilizing onboard water sources. This shielding material could be grown onboard and applied as needed prior to different radiation landscapes (commonly seen during missions involving gravitational assists). The material is a bioplastic material. Bioplastics are any combination of a biopolymer and a plasticizer. In this case, the biopolymer is a starch-based material and a commonly accessible plasticizer. Starch molecules are composed of two major polymers: amylase and amylopectin. The biopolymer phenolic compounds are common to the ablative thermal protection system family of materials. With similar constituents come similar chemical ablation processes, {{with the potential to}} have comparable, if not better, ablation characteristics. It can also be used as a flame-resistant barrier for commercial applications in buildings, homes, cars, and heater firewall material. The biopolymer is observed to undergo chemical transformations (oxidative and structural degradation) at radiation doses that are 1, 000 times the maximum dose of an unmanned mission (10 - 25 Mrad), indicating {{that it would be a}} viable candidate for robust radiation shielding. As a comparison, the total <b>integrated</b> <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> for a three-year manned mission to Mars is 0. 1 krad, far below the radiation limit at which starch molecules degrade. For electron radiation, the biopolymer starches show minimal deterioration when exposed to energies greater than 180 keV. This flame-resistant, thermal-insulating material is non-hazardous and may be sustainably sourced. It poses no hazardous waste threats during its lifecycle. The material composition is radiation-tolerant up to megarad doses, indicating its use as a radiation shielding material. It is lightweight, non-metallic, and able to be mechanically densified, permitting a tunable gradient of thermal and radiation protection as needed. The dual-use (thermal and radiation shielding), sustainable nature of this material makes it suitable for both industrial applications as a sustainable/green building material, and for space applications as thermal protection material and radiation shield...|$|E

40|$|Introduction The {{number of}} {{computed}} tomography (CT) examinations has increased rapidly since CT became commercially available. This resulted in growing concerns regarding {{the risk of}} malignancies induced by application of medical ionizing <b>radiation.</b> Therefore, <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> reduction strategies are needed and being developed. This {{is especially important for}} patients who get many CT scans (e. g. chest CT for follow up of lung nodules), CT scans with high <b>radiation</b> <b>doses</b> (e. g. scans of the heart) and for children who are more sensitive to <b>radiation.</b> A recent <b>dose</b> reduction strategy focuses on optimization of image reconstruction. With current reconstruction methods, <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> reduction results in noisy images, which are susceptible to artefacts. Iterative reconstruction (IR) is an alternative image reconstruction method that allows for image quality improvement at similar <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> or imaging at lower <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> without compromising image quality compared to current methods. Improved computational power of CT reconstruction workstations has permitted the recent introduction of IR for CT. Purpose The aim of this thesis was to evaluate both potential applications of IR: improving image quality and reducing <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> of CT scans of the heart and the lungs. First, in-vitro and ex-vivo preclinical research was performed to globally assess the potentials of IR for both applications. Second, image acquisition of cardiopulmonary CT examinations was optimized in-vivo with IR. Finally, IR was applied to reduce the <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> in the clinical setting and explore novel indications for CT. Results With the current thesis, we showed that IR can be used to improve image quality in routine dose CT, to reduce the <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> without loss of image quality, or with a combination of both strategies. We conclude that <b>radiation</b> <b>doses</b> for CCTA, calcium scoring CT, contrast-enhanced chest CT and plain chest CT can be reduced substantially by using IR. For calcium scoring CT scans of the heart, we first performed a phantom study, then an ex-vivo study and finally a pilot study in 30 individuals evaluating the maximally achievable <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> reduction.

40|$|The of {{the hybrid}} Operation room (an {{operation}} room combined with advanced radiological X-ray equipment) is gaining popularity, {{as it is}} now the preferred room to perform (complex) endovascular aortic procedures. The fixed C-arms equipped in these rooms make it possible to gain very high image quality, add the use of advanced 3 D imaging techniques to the procedure, while the room is optimized for the use of X-ray radiation. Moreover, with a hybrid OR, including these advanced imaging options, combined with evolving stent graft designs, more patients with an aortic aneurysm become eligible for an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), resulting in the fact that both more EVARS, as well as that more complex EVARs, are nowadays performed. Unfortunately, the transition from a standard operation room with a mobile C-arm towards a Hybrid OR with a fixed C-arm is also complicated by the much higher <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> rates as a result of using fixed C-arms. When the operating team does not adapt their working habits, they will be at risk to absorb much high <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> per procedure, and they are at risk to reach their yearly dose limits when working in a hybrid operating environment. In this thesis, we studied the <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> outcomes at three different levels, and for each level, we studied both the effects of radiation exposure to the patient, as well as the effects of the absorbed <b>radiation</b> <b>doses</b> to the surgical staff. The first level included the cumulative <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> outcomes per type of procedure. Using the cumulative <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> outcomes, we were able to analyse the efficiently for new radiation and imaging techniques on reducing the <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> rate. We have shown that for noncomplex (for example bifurcated EVARs) <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> can double when a similar process is performed in a Hybrid OR vs. a standard OR. Additionally, we studied the efficacy of new techniques which may be able to reduce the intraoperative dose, for example, an advanced image processing upgrade which can reduce the radiation in the Hybrid OR or the use of new imaging strategies such as 3 D road mapping using contrast-enhanced Cone beam CT. In the second level,we studied which procedural steps during the variety of EVAR procedures accords for very high <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> and which EVAR steps are relatively safe. The primary goal {{of this study was to}} analyse <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> fluctuations during the procedure and to extract the procedural steps that accord to relatively high <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> exposure and analyse which EVAR procedural steps are relatively safe.

This level was independent of the specific procedure in which the image was used, but dose rates were analysed for each acquired image or X-ray run. The outcomes of these radiation prediction models were translated to an instant patient radiation risk chart and an instant operator radiation risk chart. These charts included the predicted <b>radiation</b> <b>dose</b> for both the patient and the operator, as well as the predicted time they can use these settings until dose thresholds are reached (2 Gray skin threshold for patient sand 20 milliSieverts/year for the operator).
