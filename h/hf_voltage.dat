The dual-frequency discharges are shown to burn {{in one of three}} possible modes. At small LF voltages the first mode is observed, i. e. the HF discharge perturbed by the LF voltage. The second mode, i. e. the combined discharge, exists in the presence of intense ionization in the sheaths, when the LF voltage exceeds some critical value. The third mode (the LF discharge perturbed by an HF field) is observed when a small <b>HF</b> <b>voltage</b> is applied to the burning LF discharge. The range of parameters within which the first mode of the combined discharge may be extinguished by the LF voltage increase is shown to be limited by the HF discharge extinction curve from the low-pressure side as well as the lowest <b>HF</b> <b>voltage</b> for the transition of the discharge from the first mode to the second one...|$|E

40|$|Permanent magnet motors have {{a series}} of {{characteristics}} that make them attractive for the use in industrial drives: low maintenance, high dynamics, small size and mass to power ratio. In particular its higher efficiency means that permanent magnet synchronous motors may be used instead of electro-magnetically exited motors (such induction machines or commutator DC motors) in applications where the energy savings compensate the higher initial cost. Nevertheless, the need for a shaft mounted position measurement to perform the orientation of the control of the synchronous machine is of concern, because it increases the total drive cost and reduces reliability. In this work the sensorless vector control of a surface mounted permanent magnet machine is presented. The emphasis is in the control at low and zero speed, including position control, by means of saturation saliency tracking. Two different strategies for rotor position detection used in salient synchronous machines and in induction machines are analysed. These are <b>hf</b> <b>voltage</b> injection in the stationary, stator, reference frame of the machine (α-ß injection) and <b>hf</b> <b>voltage</b> injection on the estimated rotor axis (so called d-axis or pulsating injection). These two methods are optimised for its application to the surface mounted PM machine. The small magnitude of the saliency present difficulties and disturbances are significant. A commissioning based method (SMP) is used for enhanced rotor position estimation by the α-ß rotating injection. The two methods are implemented on a 4 kW experimental rig and the sensorless controlled results are compared and discussed. A hybrid structure combining the saliency tracking method with a flux-observer is also presented and provides sensorless control capability over the whole speed range.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the quasistatic (QS) and high {{frequency}} (<b>HF)</b> capacitance <b>voltage</b> (CV) method are applied on Al/SiO_ 2 /p-Si MOS capacitors for characterisation of the SiO_ 2 /Si interface. The QS CV curves are {{recorded in the}} dark and under various illumination levels. We find that conventional analysis of interface state distribution leads to contradictious results for the QS and the HF CV curves, respectively. Furthermore, the QS CV curves under illumination show a distinct sharp peak which cannot result from interface states. It is that all these features can be consistently explained with a model, which considers surface states as well as near-interface oxide states interacting with the space charge region via tunneling processes. The capture cross section ratio #sigma#_p/#sigma#_n of interface states required by the model agrees with data obtained from deep level transient spectroscopy. We believe that near-interface oxid states contribute significantly to the net surface recombination velocity and confirm this by correlation of the modeled oxide trap density with independently measured effective minority carrier lifetime.

The specific methods considered employ saliency tracking high frequency (<b>hf)</b> <b>voltage</b> injection in the machine's estimated d axis. In terms of the audible noise reduction, a novel random sinusoidal hf injection sensorless method has been proposed. The perceived audible noise due to the hf injection can be reduced by randomly distributing the injection frequencies around a centre frequency, such that it {{is perceived as a}} background hiss rather than the fixed tone heard with fixed hf injection methods. By analysing the A-weighting scales used to classify human perception of audible noise and frequency analysis of the recorded noise, an injection frequency of (lS 00 ± 328) Hz is found to have the lowest audible noise level compared to other random frequencies and other fixed frequencies methods. A 10 kHz square wave hf injection sensorless method has also been implemented. The frequency analysis of the recorded audible noise indicates that it also may be lower than for the fixed hf sinusoidal injection. In terms of control performance, sensorless torque control for these methods has been achieved from zero speed to ± 240 rpm with up to ± 60 A load (about 63 % rated load).

40|$|Interior {{permanent}} magnet synchronous motors (IPMSMs) are being increasingly used in industry,home application and automobile. The advantages are reduction of motor loss, higher power density,lower rotor inertia, and more robust of the rotor. Since {{the cost and}} space of position sensor aredisadvantages, sensorless IPMSM control systems make these drivers more competitive. The MSVPWM pattern based on the saliency effect for sensorless control has good performance atvery low speed and independent on motor parameters. In this method, the <b>HF</b> components of <b>voltage</b> and　current produced by the MSVPWM pattern are used. In　this way, no injected signal interacts with the　current controller. The response of HF component is obtained by a simple current sampling device. With　this method, the real-time position can be evaluated at low and zero speed. The main study in thesis {{is shown in the}} following. (1) In practical application, the inverter nonlinear effects, e. g., voltage drop in power devices, deadtime, gate drive circuits delay, switching delay, parasitic capacitance effect, zero current clamping effect, and so on, introduce disturbance. Note that the switching state must to be changed more frequently than that in the conventional SVPWM during a modulation period. The voltage vectors during deadtime are uncertain and multiple because all the six output voltage vectors are nonzero. Therefore, the influence of the inverter nonlinear effects is more complicated and serious. An improved position estimationscheme with inverter nonlinear effects ompensation is developed. (2) An inductance estimation method for sensorless IPMSM drives is discussed. It is unique to thismethod that not only the rotor position but also the inductance parameter values can be estimatedinstantaneously during a modulation period. Unfortunately, all the position estimation methods based on the saliency effect can identify the axis of the magnets, but not the magnetic polarity. A novel magnet polarity identification method for initial position estimation during startup for sensorless IPMSM drive is presented. The method is based on MSVPWM pattern. It is unique that magnet polarity can be identified by the variation of the estimated d-axis inductance. (3) Since the conventional SVPWM is possibly the best among all the PWM techniques, modified PWM pattern must compromise PWM performance {{in order to make the}} magnetic saliency effect available. One disadvantage of modified PWM pattern is that the undesired switching sequence boosts theharmonics current. Since six active voltage vectors are generated by the MSVPWM during a PWM period, the output sequences of the six error voltage vectors lead to the different kinds of current ripple. This paper analyzes the current ripple during a PWM period for the various possible schemes of MSVPWM, and proposes a novel PWM scheme for reduced current ripple. The harmonic loss and the efficiency of the system can be improved by the proposed PWM scheme. エネルギーや地球環境の問題を解決していく上で，電気エネルギーを高効率で変換，制御することのできるパワーエレクトロニクス技術の重要性がますます高まっている。内部永久磁石同期モータ(IPMSM) には，体積が小さい，重量が軽い，構造が簡単，効率が高い，制御性が良いなどの特長があるため，現在電気自動車や風力発電などの応用分野で広く採用されている。ネオジム磁石を使った永久磁石同期モータが登場する以前は，自動車を走らせるような大出力の交流モータとして主に誘導モータが使用されてきた。現在では，IPMSMは小型高性能という点で誘導モータを上回り，電気自動車の高性能化に大きく貢献している。IPMSMの速度閉ループ制御にはモータの位置信号が必要であるため，通常はモータに位置センサを取付ける必要があるが，以下のような欠点がある： 1. 位置センサとそのスペースのため，コストと体積が増加。 2. 位置センサの信号線の断線などによる信頼性。 3. 位置センサによる耐環境性（高低温度、湿度、振動）に対する制約。以上の問題を解決するため，モータの電圧、電流と数学モデルを利用して、位置信号を獲得する，すなわち位置センサレスIPMモータ駆動システムが提案されている。この位置センサレスIPMSM駆動システムの高性能化は駆動システムの低コスト、省スペース，高信頼性化のために最も重要なテーマの一つである。IPMSMの突極性によって，固定子巻線から見た自己インダクタンスは回転子の位置によって変化するので，自己インダクタンスを測定し,dq軸インダクタンスの違いを利用して回転子位置を推定可能である。突極性に基づく位置センサレス駆動の利点は停止時や低速時にも位置推定が可能、推定精度が高いである。本論文ではこの位置推定法を採用する。本論文の構成をまとめると以下のようになる。(1) マルチ空間ベクトルPWMパターンで発生する電流の大きさはモータの磁気特性との関係がある。印加される電圧信号と発生する電流の大きさはモータの回転子位置情報を含んでいる。相電流から高調波電流を抽出できるが，インバータの非線形性のため，実際に印加される高調波電圧は理論値に対して，誤差が発生し，位置推定にも悪影響を与える。このため，高調波電圧の誤差を補償して，位置推定の精度を改善する方法を開発した。(2) 突極性に基づく位置推定法では磁極の判定が原理的に不可能である。このため，モータを始動する際，推定インダクタンスの変化に基づく磁極判定法を開発した。この方法はモータの位置信号を推定すると同時に，インダクタンスもリアルタイムで推定できるという他の方法にはない特性を用いて，磁気飽和によりインダクタンスが変化する特性を利用して磁極検出を行った。(3) 提案しているマルチ空間ベクトルPWMを用いた方法は、PWMにより発生する高調波電圧電流成分を利用して，位置推定を行う。発生する高調波電流成分の大きさは電圧指令値及びPWMパターンで決めた出力電圧ベクトルの順番と関係して，有効成分と無効成分を二種類に分けることができる。しかし，これまでにこのPWMパターンに対する高調波電流成分の大きさを理論計算した研究はない。位置推定用に必要な高調波電流成分を維持しつつ，無効な高調波電流成分をできる限り低減して，高調波電流による損失やトルクリプルを改善することを目的とする...|$|R
40|$|My diploma {{thesis is}} focused on a {{comparison}} of direct-current and high frequency (15 - 80 kHz) electric discharge, which generates non-thermal plasma in water solution of sodium chloride. Mainly current-voltage and Lissajous charts {{are discussed in the}} first part of this thesis. These charts describe different discharge phases: electrolysis, bubble formation, discharge breakdown and discharge regular operation in a pin-hole of a dielectric barrier. Influence of frequency, electrolyte conductivity, thickness of the diaphragm (or length of the capillary) and pin-hole diameter on discharge breakdown and bubble generation was studied, too. Measurements were realized in a polycarbonate reactor with total volume of 110 ml, which was divided by a changeable polyacetal insulating wall. This wall divided the reactor into two approximately equal spaces with one stainless steel planar electrode in each part. The Shapal-MTM ceramic discs (thickness of 0. 3 – 1. 5 mm and diameter of the central pin-hole of 0. 3 - 0. 9 mm) were mounted in the centre of the insulating wall. Initial conductivity of sodium chloride solution was chosen within the interval of 100900 S/cm. The second part of my thesis compares an influence of the direct-current (DC) and high frequency (HF) power sources on physical solution properties (conductivity, pH and temperature) and generation of hydrogen peroxide. A plasma reactor with total volume of 4 l and with mixing set up was divided into two equal spaces with one planar platinum electrode in each part. Diaphragm with thickness of 0. 6 mm and pin-hole diameter of 0. 6 mm was installed in the middle of the separating wall. Experiment was held at discharge operation of 45 W for 40 minutes with both power sources. Detection of hydrogen peroxide was realised by using a titanium reagent forming a yellow complex, which was analysed by absorption spectroscopy. If HF discharge power is plotted as a function of applied frequency, exponential decrease of frequency with increasing power can be observed. Higher breakdown voltage is necessary for thicker dielectric barriers, on the other hand for bigger diameter of the pin-hole lower breakdown voltage and higher power is needed in DC as well as in <b>HF</b> regime. Breakdown <b>voltage</b> is decreased by the increasing conductivity in both regimes; due to more charge carriers in the higher conductivity lower breakdown voltage is needed. However frequency in HF regime and DC discharge power increases. HF discharge power is decreased by the increasing conductivity. Solution conductivity and temperature are increased by initial conductivity value in both discharge regimes. Solution pH drops to acidic conditions when HF or DC positive regime is applied due to the generation of reactive species and electrolysis (in DC regime). However solution becomes alkaline when DC negative regime is applied. Concentration of hydrogen peroxide is produced linearly when HF or DC negative regime is applied and it depends on initial solution conductivity...|$|R
