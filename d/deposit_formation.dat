50|$|There {{also appears}} to be {{discrete}} time periods in which porphyry <b>deposit</b> <b>formation</b> appears to be concentrated or preferred. For copper-molybdenum porphyry deposits, formation is broadly concentrated in three time periods: Palaeocene-Eocene, Eocene-Oligocene, and middle Miocene-Pliocene. For both porphyry and epithermal gold deposits, they are generally from the time period ranging from the middle Miocene to the Recent period., however notable exceptions are known. Most large-scale porphyry deposits have an age of less than 20 million years., however there are notable exceptions, such as the 438 million year old Cadia-Ridgeway deposit in New South Wales. This relatively young age reflects the preservation potential of this type of deposit; as they are typically located in zones of highly active tectonic and geological processes, such as: deformation, uplift, and erosion. It may be however, that the skewed distribution towards most deposits being less than 20 million years is at least partially an artifact of exploration methodology and model assumptions, as large examples are known in areas which were previously left only partially or under-explored partly due to their perceived older host rock ages, but which were then later found to contain large, world class examples of much older porphyry copper deposits.|$|E
40|$|Diesel {{engines are}} widely used in heavy duty {{transportation}} applications such as in trucks, buses and ships because of their reliability and high torque output. A key diesel technology is the injection system which is constantly improved to produce better spray quality and deeper spray penetration in the combustion chamber by using high injection pressure and improving {{the design of the}} nozzle holes. The hole size has been continuously reduced; future diameters less than 100 um are expected. Smaller nozzle holes are vulnerable to <b>deposit</b> <b>formation,</b> which will reduce the flow rate and affect the spray pattern. The objective {{of this study is to}} understand the processes that would lead to <b>deposit</b> <b>formation</b> on the injector nozzle surfaces. In specific, a detailed mechanism is proposed after observing engine and injector simulation results. Models for the physical processes and chemical mechanisms responsible for the <b>deposit</b> <b>formation</b> are developed. These models are incorporated into a integrated software package to facilitate calculations of <b>deposit</b> <b>formation</b> rates under different conditions. A benchscale test rig is also constructed to measure the <b>deposit</b> <b>formation</b> of different fuels and detergents. Experiments show that the test procedure can differentiate good detergents from ineffective ones; hence it can be used to pre-screen the detergents and fuels before engine tests. Thus the cost of testing could be reduced substantially. This study is the first to develop a comprehensive quantitative model for injector nozzle <b>deposit</b> <b>formation</b> and a bench scale testing apparatus encompassing the key <b>deposit</b> <b>formation</b> processes of film formation, evaporation and washing. by YinChun Wang.
