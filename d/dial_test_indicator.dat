50|$|<b>Dial</b> <b>test</b> <b>indicators,</b> whose tips {{swing in}} an arc rather than {{plunging}} linearly, usually have spherical tips. This shape gives point contact, allowing for consistent measurements as the tip moves through its arc (via consistent offset distance from ball surface to center point, regardless of ball contact angle with the measured surface). Several spherical diameters are commercially offered; 1mm, 2mm, and 3mm are the standard sizes.|$|R
5000|$|The newer name [...] "full {{indicator}} movement" [...] (FIM) {{was coined}} {{to emphasize the}} requirement of zero cosine error. Whereas <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> <b>indicators</b> will give a foreshortened reading if their tips are on an angle to the surface being measured (cosine error), a drawing callout of FIM is defined as referring to the distance traveled by the extremity of the tip—not by the lesser amount that its lever-like action moves the needle. Thus a FIM requirement is only met when the measured part itself is truly in geometric compliance—not merely when the needle sweeps a certain arc of the dial.|$|R
50|$|A <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> <b>{{indicator}},</b> {{also known}} as a lever arm test indicator or finger indicator, has a smaller measuring range than a standard dial indicator. A test indicator measures the deflection of the arm, the probe does not retract but swings in an arc around its hinge point. The lever may be interchanged for length or ball diameter, and permits measurements to be taken in narrow grooves and small bores where the body of a probe type may not reach. The model shown is bidirectional, some types may have to be switched via a side lever to be able to measure in the opposite direction.|$|E

Because a centerless grinding line has typically three grinding machines the operator must be in complete control and must prevent blockages in transfers, grinding exits and packing areas, also size and quality must constantly be checked, so the operator is always alert while operating the line and checking for problems and quality issues.|$|E

Soil shear resistance indices (C, φ) are determined according to the τ-σ curve. Soil shearing stress (τ) was calculated by the formula τ[*]=[*]KR and tested using a strain-controlled direct shear apparatus. The quantum ring rate coefficient of determination (K) is set as 2.5 kPa/ 0.01  mm, and the unit of <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> <b>indicator</b> readings (R) was set as 0.01  mm. Each sample of the soil-root system was cut into four cylindrical testing samples (diameter 8  cm, depth 2  cm) which was put into a shear box and saturated with water for the determination of shearing stress. Five samples were tested repeatedly at each altitude gradient. The roots of each sample were separated and dried to a constant mass at 60 °C in an oven, and weighed to test their biomass for the relationship analysis between shear strength and root structure.|$|E
50|$|Mounting the {{indicator}} may be done several ways. Many indicators have a mounting lug {{with a hole}} for a bolt {{as part of the}} back plate. Alternately, the device can be held by the cylindrical stem that guides the plunger using a collet or special clamp, which is the method generally used by tools designed to integrate an indicator as a primary component, such as thickness gauges and comparators. Common outside diameters for the stem are 3/8 inch and 8 mm, though there are other diameters made.

One common single lever <b>test</b> <b>indicator</b> was the Starrett (No. 64), and those using systems of levers for amplification were made by companies such Starrett (No. 564) and Lufkin (No. 199A), as well as smaller companies like Ideal Tool Co.

This equipment was substantially extended in the eighties by two „small“ mechanical presses FPZ 100 (max. force 100 kN) and FPZ 10 (max. force 10 kN) purchased in 1987 from GDR. But a really great progress came with the mechanical press ZWICK 1494 (500 kN) controlled by computer with a possibility of recording and processing the data. This press was bought from ZWICK Ulm (FRG) in 1985.

30|$|Two {{independent}} examiners {{performed the}} <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> in knees of 52 patients after knee distorsion with a suspicion on ACL rupture. The <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> {{was performed in}} prone position in 30 °, 60 ° and 90 ° of flexion of the knees. ≥ 10 ° side-to-side difference was considered a positive <b>dial</b> <b>test.</b> For quantification {{of the amount of}} rotation in degrees, a measuring device was used with a standardized 6  Nm force, using a digital torque adapter on a booth. The intra-rater, inter-rater and rater-device agreement were determined by calculating kappa (κ) for the <b>dial</b> <b>test.</b>|$|R
30|$|The <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> was {{performed}} in prone position with flexion angles of the knee of 30 °, 60 ° and 90 ° (Veltri & Warren, 1993). Side-to-side difference of ≥ 10 ° of external rotation was considered a positive <b>dial</b> <b>test.</b> The test was scored either positive or negative.|$|R
30|$|This {{study has}} several limitations. We did not compare {{results of the}} manual <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> {{performed}} in prone position compared to the supine position. Also, we did not differentiate between injury to the PLC or the medial structures which could both result in a positive <b>dial</b> <b>test.</b> No ICC was calculated for the manual <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> due to dichotomy of the results. Therefore, no minimal detectable change (MDC) and minimal clinically important difference (MCID) were calculated. We tried to minimize factors that influence {{the result of the}} <b>dial</b> <b>test.</b> However, the accuracy of the test depends on applied torque of the examiner, accuracy of estimating 10 ° side-to-side difference and laxity of the patient. Moreover, the patient’s reflex to resist instability tests due to discomfort or fear may result in some inaccuracies, such as a positive <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> on the healthy contralateral knee. Also, the orthopaedic surgeon was not blinded in contrast to the second examiner. No significant intra-rater agreement was found, possibly due to a large time interval between the assessments and a small sample size, resulting in large confidence intervals. Also, we do not know whether the time between ACL injury and physical examination influences the amount of external rotation and thus the outcome of the <b>dial</b> <b>test.</b> Because of the absence of a gold standard and the heterogeneity of concomitant injury of our patient population no sensitivity and specificity for the <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> could be calculated for diagnosing PLC injury. However, we do believe this is a representative and clinically relevant group of patients in whom the <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> should be performed.|$|R
30|$|Therefore, {{the purpose}} of this study is to {{determine}} the reliability of the manual <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> by focusing on the rater agreement in patients with suspected ACL injury and possible concomitant injury of the knee. We hypothesize that the <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> has good rater agreement.|$|R
30|$|Posterolateral rotatory {{instability}} (PLRI) of {{the knee}} can easily be missed, because {{attention is paid to}} injury of the cruciate ligaments. If left untreated this clinical instability may persist after reconstruction of the cruciate ligaments and may put the graft at risk of failure. Even though the <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> is widely used to diagnose PLRI, no validity and reliability studies of the manual <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> are yet performed in patients. This study focuses on the reliability of the manual <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> by determining the rater agreement.|$|R
30|$|In {{this study}} we {{focussed}} on increased external rotation as assessed by the <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> in the ACL-injured knee. The principal {{finding of this study}} is that the manual <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> has a fair inter-rater agreement in 30 ° and 90 ° of flexion in patients with ACL injury.|$|R
30|$|Reliability <b>testing</b> of the <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> {{has only}} been {{performed}} in several studies (Forsythe et al., 2017; Jung et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2010; Krause et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2015). These studies show substantial to almost perfect agreement, ranging from 0.60 to 0.92, when using an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) {{that can be used}} for quantitative measurements of tibial external rotation. However, the manual <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> is scored positive or negative by the clinician and no measurement tool is incorporated in to daily practice, therefore an ICC is not useful for determining reliability of the manual <b>dial</b> <b>test.</b> Results of these reliability studies (Forsythe et al., 2017; Jung et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2010; Krause et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2015) are difficult to compare as groups of patients, method of measurement and position in which the <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> is performed, differ from one another.|$|R
30|$|Literature on the {{reliability}} of the <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> is limited (Jung et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2010; Krause et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2015), especially in patients with ACL injury (Forsythe et al., 2017; Samukawa et al., 2007). At the moment no validity and reliability studies of the manual <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> are performed in patients with ACL injury yet.|$|R
30|$|Besides {{variations}} in applied torque by different examiners, {{the amount of}} laxity can also influence {{the result of the}} <b>dial</b> <b>test.</b> Cooper et al. (Cooper, 1991) performed the <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> on healthy subjects under anesthesia. They found that the amount of external rotation laxity varied inversely according to their laxity index and that the thigh-foot angle only indirectly correlates with tibial rotation at the knee. Another study of Stinton et al. (Stinton et al., 2016) shows contradictory results. They state that the foot is not an accurate measure of tibial rotation and that the <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> performed by the clinician should focus on observation at the tibial tubercle and not on the foot. Because of these factors affecting the result of the <b>dial</b> <b>test,</b> it might be beneficial that an increase of side-to-side difference of external tibial rotation must be evaluated as a part of maximum external rotation, resulting in a percentage. This eliminates the individual variety in rotation laxity.|$|R
30|$|In summary, several {{patients}} with ACL injury showed increased external {{rotation of the}} knee as assessed by the manual <b>dial</b> <b>test.</b> This study found fair inter-rater agreement of the manual <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> performed in prone position in {{patients with}} ACL injury. Based on this study rater agreement reliability of the manual <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> is questionable in the patient suspected for ACL injury, with or without concomitant injury. Diagnosing PLRI depends highly on the orthopaedic surgeon performing the <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> if no injury to the PLC is seen on MRI. This can result in high variety in the decision {{of whether or not}} to perform an additional PLC reconstruction amongst orthopaedic surgeons. Caution should be taken when addressing PLRI with a PLC reconstruction if solely based on a positive <b>dial</b> <b>test.</b> Therefore other tests should be performed to eliminate other causes of increased external rotation in the ACL-injured knee, such as concomitant medial injury. Ideally, {{the results of this study}} should be compared to a healthy control group for further clarification on this matter. We believe that the <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> provides valuable information about the external rotation laxity of the knee. Also, further research should focus on quantification devices of tibial rotation (Bae et al., 2008; Bleday et al., 1998; Jung et al., 2009; Krause et al., 2013; Lorbach et al., 2012; Musahl et al., 2007; Stinton et al., 2016; Tsai et al., 2008), so that the increase of tibial rotation can be evaluated in relation to total rotation.|$|R

30|$|Many clinicians use the <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> {{in their}} daily {{practice}} for assessing PLRI in the ACL-deficient knee {{and whether or not}} to perform a PLC reconstruction of the knee at time of ACL reconstruction. The <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> is easy to perform and understand, and is widely accepted to diagnose PLRI of the knee in combination with other tests. We acknowledge the difficulty of relying on physical examination for the diagnosis of PLRI and no objective quantitative test exists for assessing increased external rotation. This makes accurate diagnosis of PLRI difficult (Laprade et al., 2014). As is known, a positive <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> may result from either posterolateral or medial knee injuries (Griffith et al., 2009; Wijdicks et al., 2010) and the results of rotatory instability tests should be carefully interpreted.|$|R
30|$|Rater {{agreement}} {{reliability of}} the manual <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> is questionable. It has a fair inter-rater agreement in 30 ° and 90 ° of flexion.|$|R
30|$|Our {{purpose in}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the clinical outcome of isolated PLC reconstruction following the fibular-based technique performed in patients with chronic isolated PLC injury. The present study shows good results in terms of Lysholm and IKDC scores for both surgical techniques, nearly normal postoperative knee ROM, and good lateral and posterolateral knee stability observed on <b>Dial</b> <b>test</b> and varus stress test. No correlation was found comparing clinical results by <b>Dial</b> <b>test</b> and varus stress test with Lysholm score and IKDC score.|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to cruciate ligament tests, a specific posterolateral corner evaluation was performed. The <b>Dial</b> <b>test</b> (at 30 ° and 90 ° knee flexion) and the varus stress test (at 0 ° and 30 ° knee flexion) were performed, respectively, in prone and supine position. The {{results of these}} tests were {{compared with those of}} the contralateral, uninvolved knee and were considered normal when no difference was found between the involved and uninvolved knee. Instability was graded from 0 to 3 + (Table  2) [7]. The <b>Dial</b> <b>test</b> and the varus stress test were performed also preoperatively with the patient under spinal or general anesthesia. Furthermore, arthroscopic evaluation was performed to detect more than 1  cm of lateral compartment opening with application of varus knee stress (“drive-through” sign) [8]. Surgical reconstruction was performed upon positivity of the <b>Dial</b> <b>test,</b> varus stress test, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination, and if the drive-through sign was present.|$|R
30|$|There is no {{consensus}} in literature whether the <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> should be performed in prone or supine position in the ACL-deficient knee (Lunden et al., 2010). It was first described in supine position (Loomer, 1991) and later on in prone position (Veltri & Warren, 1993). Performing the <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> in prone position is considered the same as applying an anterior force to the tibia when performed in supine position (Jung et al., 2009; Strauss et al., 2007). Even though no posterior tibial subluxation will be visible if the posterior subluxation is reduced in the PCL-injured knee, it increases the ability of an examiner to detect a concomitant PLC injury {{in the setting of}} a PCL-deficient knee (Jung et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2015; Strauss et al., 2007). No such studies are performed in the ACL-deficient knee. Therefore, we chose to perform the <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> in prone position in the suspected ACL-injured patient, because it offers easy control of the flexion angles in the knee, flexion of the hips, manual torque applied and requires only one examiner.|$|R
30|$|The <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> is {{considered}} positive if ≥ 10 ° side-to-side difference is present (Veltri & Warren, 1993), however as is known side-to-side differences {{are present in}} healthy subjects and in the ACL-injured knee without concomitant PLC injury (Forsythe et al., 2017; Krause et al., 2013). A study from Krause et al. (Krause et al., 2013) demonstrated side-to-side differences ranging from 4.7 ° to 5.9 ° in healthy subjects. They show that a threshold of ≥ 10 ° side-to-side difference results in incorrect positive testing in 21 % of their subjects {{and therefore suggest a}} threshold of ≥ 15 ° side-to-side difference. Even though biomechanical cadaveric studies suggest that the ACL does play a secondary role in restraining internal tibial rotation (Mouton et al., 2012; Wroble et al., 1993), a study of Forsythe et al. (Forsythe et al., 2017) demonstrated that isolated deficiency of the ACL accounts for nearly 7 ° of tibial external rotation found by the <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> in the absence of PLC injury and caution should be taken when interpreting the <b>dial</b> <b>test.</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: To {{determine}} if tibial positioning affects the external {{rotation of the}} tibia in a <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> for posterolateral rotatory instability combined with posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries. Methods: Between April 2007 and October 2007, 16 patients with a PCL tear and posterolateral rotatory instability were diagnosed using a <b>dial</b> <b>test.</b> The thigh-foot angle was measured at both 30 ° and 90 ° of knee fl exion with an external rotation stress applied to the tibia in 2 different positions (reduction and posterior subluxation). The measurements were performed twice by 2 orthopedic surgeons. Results: In posterior subluxation, the mean side-to-side difference in the thigh-foot angle was 11. 56 ± 3. 01 ° at 30 ° of knee fl exion and 11. 88 ± 4. 03 ° at 90 ° of knee flexion. In the sequential <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> performed with the tibia reduced, the mean side-to-side difference was 15. 94 ± 4. 17 ° (p < 0. 05) at 30 ° of knee fl exion and 16. 88 ± 4. 42 ° (p = 0. 001) at 90 ° of knee fl exion. The mean tibial external rotation was 5. 31 ± 2. 86 ° and 6. 87 ± 3. 59 ° higher in the reduced position than in the posterior subluxation at both 30 ° and 90 ° of knee fl exion.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the usefulness of tibial reduction during <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> for clinical detection of underestimated posterolateral rotatory instability (PLRI) in combined posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) -posterolateral corner (PLC) deficient knee in terms of external rotation laxity and clinical outcomes. Twenty-one patients who classified as grade I PLRI using <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> with subluxated tibia, but classified as grade II with tibial reduction evaluated retrospectively. The mean follow-up was 39. 3 months (range 24 - 61 months). Each patient was evaluated by the following variables: posterior translation and varus laxity on radiograph, KT- 1000 arthrometer, <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> (reduced and subluxated position), International Knee Documentation Committee, Orthopadische Arbeitsgruppe Knie scoring system and Tegner activity scale. There were significant improvements in posterior tibial translation (8. 6 +/- A 2. 0 to 2. 1 +/- A 1. 0 mm; P < 0. 001), varus laxity (3. 3 +/- A 1. 3 to 1. 4 +/- A 0. 5 mm; P < 0. 001) and external rotation (13. 2 A degrees A A +/- A 0. 8 A degrees to 3. 6 A degrees A A +/- A 1. 1 A degrees at 30 A degrees, 13. 3 A degrees A A +/- A 0. 9 A degrees to 3. 6 A degrees A A +/- A 0. 9 A degrees at 90 A degrees; P < 0. 001). The clinical scores were improved significantly at the last follow-up (P < 0. 001).

30|$|No {{correlation}} {{was found on}} comparing the clinical results on <b>Dial</b> <b>test</b> with the Lysholm score (P =  0.917) or IKDC score (P =  0.489).

30|$|Likewise, {{significant}} {{correlations between the}} <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> and injury to structures of the PLC were found during surgical exploration (Kim et al., 2010; Laprade & Terry, 1997) and in selective ligament cutting studies performing external rotation of the tibia (Bae et al., 2008; Grood et al., 1988; Strauss et al., 2007; Veltri et al., 1995; Wroble et al., 1993). Nonetheless a cadaveric study of Bae et al. (Bae et al., 2008) suggests that in patients with ACL injury, injury to less than three posterolateral structures (excluding the PCL) might not be clinically detected by the <b>dial</b> <b>test.</b> Also Veltri et al. (Veltri et al., 1995) state that the standard external rotation test performed at 30 ° of knee flexion may not be routinely reliable for detecting combined anterior cruciate and posterolateral ligament injury. They suggest that increased total rotation may be indicative for injury to the posterolateral structures in the ACL-deficient knee. Furthermore, a study of Griffith et al. (Griffith et al., 2009) shows that significant increases in external rotation at 30 ° of knee flexion were found with all medial knee structures sectioned, which indicates that a positive <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> may be found not only for posterolateral knee injuries but also for medial knee injuries. Therefore, careful correlation {{with the results of}} valgus stress testing and assessment of the location of tibial subluxation during the <b>dial</b> <b>test,</b> performed in prone and supine position, is necessary to distinct between possible posterolateral or medial knee injury (Griffith et al., 2009; Wijdicks et al., 2010). Also comparing the lateral tibial condyle with the medial tibial condyle during posterolateral and anteromedial drawer tests can aid in this distinction (Hughston & Norwood, 1980; Wijdicks et al., 2010).|$|R
30|$|According to {{our study}} the manual <b>dial</b> <b>test</b> {{performed}} in prone position has a fair inter-rater agreement in 30 ° and 90 ° of flexion {{in patients with}} ACL injury.

As the foot rotates, watch for external rotation of the tibial tubercle of the affected knee compared to the healthy one. A difference of greater than 10-15° indicates a positive test and likely injuries to the posterolateral knee. Next, repeat the test with the patient’s knees flexed at 90°. Increased rotation at 90° indicates a combined PCL and posterolateral knee injury. If the rotation decreases compared to 30°, then an isolated PLC injury has occurred.
