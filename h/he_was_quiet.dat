His manager Miller Huggins called him [...] "indifferent". <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> and reserved, rarely giving newspaper interviews until his career was winding down. He was also known for his lazy attitude, such as refusing to run out ground balls, which many said kept him from achieving greatness.|$|E
500|$|Police officials, who {{reviewed}} the video, pictures and manifesto, {{concluded that the}} contents of the media package had marginal value in helping them learn and understand why Cho committed the killings. Dr. Michael Welner, who also {{reviewed the}} materials, believed that Cho's rantings offer little insight into the mental illness that may have triggered his rampage. Dr. Welner stated that [...] "These videos do not help us understand Cho. They distort him. He was meek. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>quiet.</b> This is a PR tape of him trying to turn himself into a Quentin Tarantino character." ...|$|E

Miller married on August 14, 1982. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> and gentle, and was [...] "a modest man, with a self-deprecating sense of humour". Miller {{described}} his own attitude towards music in a 2005 interview: I worked hard to maintain a certain mental and emotional equilibrium. It's mostly due to my faith in the Creator. I don't put all my eggs in that basket of being a rich and famous jazz guy. That allows me {{a certain amount of}} freedom, because I don't have to play music for money. I play music because I love it.|$|E

500|$|Charles II, Anne's uncle, famously said of Prince George, [...] "I {{have tried}} him drunk, and I have tried him sober {{and there is}} nothing in him". <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> and self-effacing. John Macky thought him [...] "of a familiar, easy {{disposition}} with a good sound understanding but modest in showing it... very fat, loves news, his bottle & the Queen." [...] In making fun of George's asthma, Lord Mulgrave said the Prince was forced to breathe hard in case people mistook him for dead and buried him. By the time of Queen Victoria, George had a reputation as a dullard, and was the target of disdain. Victoria hoped her own husband, Prince Albert, would never fill the [...] "subordinate part played by the very stupid and insignificant husband of Queen Anne". In the 1930s, Winston Churchill said he [...] "mattered very little", except to Anne.|$|E
500|$|SIR {{had become}} {{powerful}} enough for political maneuvering. In 1971 SIR members Jim Foster, Rick Stokes, and Advocate publisher David Goodstein formed the Alice B. Toklas Memorial Democratic Club, known as simply [...] "Alice". Alice befriended liberal politicians {{to persuade them}} to sponsor bills, proving successful in 1972 when Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon obtained Feinstein's support for an ordinance outlawing employment {{discrimination on the basis}} of sexual orientation. Alice chose Stokes to run for a relatively unimportant seat on the community college board. Though Stokes received 45,000votes, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>quiet,</b> unassuming, and did not win. Foster, however, shot to national prominence by being the first openly gay man to address a political convention. His speech at the 1972 Democratic National Convention ensured that his voice, according to San Francisco politicians, was the one to be heard when they wanted the opinions, and especially the votes, of the gay community.|$|E
500|$|According to Hudson, {{his early}} {{religious}} experiences shaped his later life. His father, a Presbyterian, became a Baptist when Hudson was nine. Six years later, his father became a Quaker. The elder Hudson's frequent changes of religion made his son a skeptic; Hudson claimed disgust with the [...] "failings and immoralities" [...] of [...] "many professing Christians." [...] Later, however, he cited the French Revolution as his religious [...] "awakening". Hudson was repelled by the uprising's violence and disregard for life; in 1798 he proclaimed himself a [...] "political Christian", {{and later a}} [...] "speculative Christian". From then on, Hudson felt it his duty to lead a religious life. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> about his beliefs, however: [...] "My pride would not permit me to unburthen my soul to any living person. I hated company". In his writings, Hudson cited the principles of [...] "morality, religion, law observance and education" [...] which may have influenced his later actions, including the settlement {{of land in the}} west.|$|E

500|$|Sanzō Nosaka {{was the son}} of {{a prosperous}} Japanese {{merchant}} and was raised in a bourgeois environment. As a young man Nosaka was known for his fashionable taste in clothing and for the large dog that often accompanied him in public. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>quiet,</b> serious, studious, introverted, and more comfortable in libraries than at public demonstrations. After his secondary education, Nosaka attended Keio University, which was then considered a [...] "rich boys school". [...] At Keio, Nosaka became interested in the international labor movement, an interest that was largely supported by one of his professors, Kiichi Horie. Nosaka decided to write his senior thesis on the moderate labor organization founded by Bunji Suzuki, [...] "Yuaikai" [...] ("The Friendly Society"). To research his thesis, Nosaka contacted Yuaikais head office, and acquainted himself with its senior leaders: Suzuki initially mistook Nosaka for a salesman the first time they met, but eventually grew fond of Nosaka. When Nosaka graduated from Keio, in 1915, he joined Yuaikai and worked for the organization as a research staff member and as an editor of the organization's journal, Rodo Oyobi Sangyo (Labour and Industry).|$|E

2500|$|This {{inspired}} Dominic to take {{a conscious}} decision to become a saint. The immediate result of this was that, not being sure how to live a saintly life, and worried about it, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> and worried for the next few days. Noticing this, John Bosco spoke to Dominic and advised him to resume his customary cheerfulness, persevere in his regular life of study and religious practices, and especially not neglect being with his companions in games and recreation. [...] On learning that his first name meant [...] "belonging to God", his desire to be a saint intensified.|$|E

2500|$|Biographer Cath Carroll {{describes}} the young Fleetwood as [...] "a dreamer, an empathetic youth" [...] who, though intelligent, did not excel academically. According {{to his own}} autobiography, Fleetwood had an extremely difficult and trying time academically at the English boarding schools he attended, including the Kings School in Gloucester. He performed poorly on exams, which he attributes to his persistent inability to commit facts to memory. He nevertheless enjoyed acting during school, often in drag, and was a competent fencer. At 6'6", he was an imposing figure, and sported a beard and long hair {{for much of his}} life. [...] "Mick was very aristocratic," [...] recalls Ken Caillat, a sound engineer on Rumours. [...] "The way he formed sentences was impeccable. When he spoke, everyone stopped and listened. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>quiet</b> and wise, and he had a great sense of humour. He loved to laugh, but he was also a straight shooter." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roy Kelton Orbison {{was born}} in Vernon, Texas, the middle son of Orbie Lee Orbison (1913–1984), an oil well driller and car mechanic, and Nadine Vesta Shults (July 25, 1913 – May 28, 1992), a nurse. Both of his parents were {{unemployed}} during the Great Depression and, searching for work, moved the family to Fort Worth, when Roy was a child. He attended Denver Avenue Elementary School until a polio scare prompted the family to return to Vernon. Later, they moved to Wink, Texas. Orbison later described life in Wink as [...] "football, oil fields, oil, grease and sand" [...] and expressed relief {{that he was able}} to leave the desolate town. All the Orbison children were afflicted with poor eyesight; Roy used thick corrective lenses from an early age. He was not confident about his appearance and began dyeing his nearly-white hair black when he was still young. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>quiet,</b> self-effacing, and remarkably polite and obliging—a product, biographer Alan Clayson wrote, of his Southern upbringing. He was readily available to sing, however, and often became the focus of attention when he did. He considered his voice memorable, if not great.|$|E
