40|$|The frozen storage {{characteristics}} of <b>fish</b> <b>fingers</b> {{made out of}} two different species, differing in lipid content {{for a period of}} six months are outlined. The study reveals that the lipid content of the fish meat used for making <b>fish</b> <b>fingers</b> influences the storage pattern in terms of the chemical parameters like peroxide value, thiobarbituric acid value and free fatty acids. The introduction of monosodium glutamate has improved the flavour of the <b>fish</b> <b>fingers.</b> Further, the application of batter on the <b>fish</b> <b>fingers</b> imparted some protective effect in the case of semi-fatty fish...|$|R

40|$|Production of <b>fish</b> <b>fingers</b> from cod sawdust {{waste and}} minced whiting was studied under {{industrial}} conditions.

The raw material and the unfried <b>fish</b> <b>fingers</b> were of excellent chemical quality. From the bacteriological point of view the addition of batter and breadcrumbs {{was the most important}} source of contamination. <b>Fish</b> <b>fingers</b> produced with 100 % minced whiting and those with a 75 / 25 (whiting/cod) composition were rejected by the taste panel for their rubbery dry texture.

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{example of}} the <b>fish</b> <b>finger</b> sandwich being created is probably during early 1981 when a nursing assistant at the old county psychiatric hospital of St Audry's in Melton, Suffolk found that he regularly {{had a lot of}} fish fingers left over following serving the patients breakfast. He discovered that although fish fingers were not particularly popular as a breakfast food, nevertheless, the kitchen served them each morning. So, rather than throw them away he decided to try them as a sandwich snack for his colleagues. Initially they simply consisted of four fish fingers between two slices of white bread along with a little tomato ketchup. They eventually proved popular with nursing staff and it seems quite likely that news of this simple, tasty snack spread by word of mouth and became popular throughout the UK.|$|E

5000|$|May {{was born}} in Dublin on 10 July 1974 in the Liberties in the south inner city. She is the {{youngest}} of five siblings, with sisters Edel Foy and Maria O'Reilly, and brothers Brendan Clabby and Fintan Clabby. In 1991, she attended Senior College Ballyfermot, where she studied Art, Graphics and Printmaking. Her early musical influences were folk and rock and roll, especially the music of Buddy Holly, Eddie Cochran and Gene Vincent. By the age of nine, she was a fan of Rockabilly and Blues, particularly Elmore James and Billie Holiday. At 14, she sang in an advertisement for Findus Fish Fingers; of which she told Graham Norton on his talk show {{that she and her}} friends as a result [...] "got known as the <b>Fish</b> <b>Finger</b> Girls." [...] However, her career began at age 16 when she began touring the Dublin club circuit and she was occasionally barred from her own shows at Dublin's Bruxelles club for being underage. [...] "I was getting tips from the best musicians in Dublin," [...] May said. [...] "One of them said, 'your voice is great, but it needs to roughen.'" [...] It was around this time, when driving a tearful Imelda to a gig after a boyfriend break-up, that her father asked her, [...] "Is your heart broken? Excellent. Now you can sing the blues." [...] After moving to the UK in 1998, May began singing with Mike Sanchez.|$|E
40|$|Fish {{fingers were}} {{produced}} from Carassius gibelio and evaluated through nutritional parameters. The <b>fish</b> <b>finger</b> nutritional composition changed with pre-frying process. The moisture, crude fat, crude protein and crude ash contents of fish fingers were determined as 56. 543 ± 0. 113, 10. 507 ± 0. 116, 15. 577 ± 0. 382 and 2. 027 ± 0. 133, respectively. Unsaturated fatty acids, especially C 18 : 1 ω- 9 and C 18 : 2 ω- 6 increased with pre-frying process. The values of pH, thiobarbituric acid (TBA) and total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) changed significantly (P< 0. 05) between fresh fish meat and pre-frying fingers. Scores for flavor, texture, color, odour and general acceptability of frying fish fingers were determined as 8. 235 ± 0. 207, 8. 412 ± 0. 193, 8. 294 ± 0. 206, 8. 353 ± 0. 170 and 8. 471 ± 0. 151, respectively...|$|E

This study was carried out to assess the physicochemical and sensory evaluation of minced fish and surimi prepared from small size of A. nibe, which is not common for human consumption. The surimi proximate composition contains protein (14. 77 ± 0. 506 %), lipid (0. 94 ± 0. 081 %), ash (0. 58 ± 0. 007 %) contents and yield rate (36. 56 ± 0. 732 %) were {{significantly lower than the}} mince, while the moisture content was higher in the surimi (79. 58 ± 0. 729 %) as compared to the mince (78. 49 ± 0. 687 %) (P< 0. 05). Total volatile bases and thiobarbituric acid values of black mouth croaker surimi were 4. 76 ± 0. 594 mg N 100 g- 1, and 0. 40 ± 0. 018 mg malondialdehyde kg- 1, which, respectively, were significantly lower than those found for the minced fish (P< 0. 05). Minced fish delivered significantly lower water holding capacity and pH value than the surimi (P< 0. 05). Higher whiteness index was obtained in the surimi (66. 23 ± 0. 029 %) compared to the mince (51. 68 ± 0. 020 %) (P< 0. 05). Total lipids of surimi contained more polyunsaturated fatty acids (36. 32 ± 0. 257 g 100 g- 1 total lipids) than other fatty acids of the minced fish (P< 0. 05). <b>Fish</b> <b>finger...</b>|$|E

5000|$|Task Review: Versatile {{decided to}} sell calamari and <b>fish</b> <b>fingers</b> made of coley. While they bargained well for their choice of fish and had good sales, they ran out <b>fish</b> <b>fingers,</b> while the calamari was of poor quality, with £150 worth lost when its {{container}} overheated, making it unsafe to sell. Meanwhile, Connexus went with salad and fishcakes, but {{got off to a}} bad start when April purchased the required quota of fish from the first vendor she met, and production of the fishcakes was delayed by Dan and Brett, causing them to miss much of the lunch rush trade and having {{less than a third of}} their intended prepared stock. While sales were steady, after they struggled initially from the salad being priced too high, many of their later sales were for reduced prices, effectively costing them the task.|$|R
