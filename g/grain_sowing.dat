With {{the support of}} MCMC approaches and conditional auto-regressive (CAR) Model, we estimated the posterior distribution through iterative sampling among per capita grain possession and the correlated factors. As a useful tool, the spatial bayesian model appeared to gain insights into per capita grain possession on spatio-temporal variability related to the <b>grain</b> <b>sowing</b> area, efficient irrigation area, agriculture machinery conditions. The study results showed that auto correlation characteristics and the posterior density distribution were described by the quantity method with CAR model, correspondingly the posterior mean of observed value and the posterior mean of predicted value of per capita grain possession were developed in Yellow River Delta.

Regional variation characteristics of grain production are introduced from two aspects {{of the decline of}} <b>grain</b> <b>sowing</b> area and the increase of grain output. According to the data in Guangxi Statistical Yearbook, comparative advantages of regional grain production in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region are analyzed by the method of Comprehensive Comparative Dominance index.

Their advantages in grain production are gradually diminished; and the grain production center is moving to central Guangxi and southern Guangxi. In order to solve the problems in grain production, Guangxi should make full use of the comparative advantage in agricultural production, carry out structural adjustment of agricultural production, and try to realize the rational distribution and specialization of agricultural production.

Although band seeding presented a satisfactory technological solution, it was never widely applied. Pneumatic systems, on the other hand, took long to catch on and only started to be successful in the late 1960 s. Up to then, these innovative systems had to be considered as failures.

Several countermeasures are put forward to ease the pressure on cultivated land in Fengxian County, in order to realize the sustainable use of cultivated land resources, to ensure the supply and demand balance of grain and cultivated land, and to stabilize and improve the grain productivity in Fengxian County, such as protecting the current cultivated land resources by the strictest protection system of cultivated land, enhancing the intensity of land development and reclamation, enlarging the area of cultivated land, increasing the agricultural sci-tech input, and improving the grain unit yield.

In our opinion, the most perspective way of presowing processing is processing by mix {{of air and}} ozone, which belongs to physical and chemical ways of impact on seed material. To obtain the mix of air and ozone is also possible in several ways. The most economically expedient way of ozone synthesis is in the barrier electric ozonizer discharge. However, to achieve a positive effect in ozone influence {{it is necessary to}} observe accurately technological parameters as dosages excess can lead to oppression of growth processes in seed. Therefore, it is necessary to consider all known hypotheses connected with ozone influence on agricultural plants and their development process. Researches in this field show that under the influence of ozone on seed material, inside a seed the cleavage of the protein mass takes place. Proteins pass into more available form and as a result it is easier for sprout to receive the nutrients in proteins that promotes the accelerated growth. It is also necessary to note that ozone saturates grain with active forms of oxygen. It is necessary as well to remember bactericidal properties of ozone, which provide destruction of harmful microflora surrounding grain.

Minimum area and deficits/ surplus of cultivated land are used to describe the cultivated pressure, and reasonable range of agricultural structural adjustment is discussed under food security baseline. The results show that the cultivated land area of the Yarkant River Basin increased in 1978 - 2009, following per capita cultivated land area declined, while it showed an icreased warily of cultivated surplus in this basin, which is varied in different counties. The structure of land use affects its benefit, that the higher the percentage of <b>grain</b> crops <b>sown</b> area, the lower the per capita agricultural gross output value and annual per capita net income of rural households. It is effectively increasing agricultural output to adjust the agricultural structure and reduce the percentage of <b>grain</b> crops <b>sown</b> area.

The paper outlines key assumptions about future changes in grain policies and other important explanatory variables in the models. On the supply side, projections are made for <b>grain</b> <b>sown</b> area, <b>grain</b> yield and total grain output. Future grain demand is disaggregated into four categories, human food, animal feed, industrial uses and seed grain, each incorporating high, medium and low demand growth scenarios. A grain balance sheet is constructed for 2010 which shows a 'most probable' import requirement of about 32 million tones—a 10 million tones increase over the actual 1995 level. Thus, net grain imports will increase substantially but China is unlikely to become an importer on a massive scale. ...|$|R
40|$|Regional grain {{flows in}} China have been {{expanding}} {{with the growth}} of grain production and the development of grain markets.

This paper examines this question by using a binomial logit model with a discrete dependent variable of provincial net grain flows, and the independent variables of regional comparative advantage indicators and other factors affecting the supply and demand in grain markets. The study reveals that the current pattern of China’s regional grain flows is consistent with the regional comparative advantage in grain production, measured by the comparative advantage indicators of Domestic Resource Costs Coefficient (DRCC) and Net Social Profitability (NSP). However, the Efficiency Advantage Indices (EAI), measured by relative grain yield, and the Scale Advantage Indices (SAI), measured by relative <b>grain</b> <b>sown</b> area, are not statistically significant determinants of the observed pattern of regional grain flows in China. This implies that government intervention in grain production is still an obstacle for the Chinese farmers to optimise their grain production mix...|$|R

While many viewing it as a supply proglem and propose to cope with it by incrasing self-supply, there are also propostitions of viewing it more as an income problem. This paper has taken the experience of China into study. Being the most populous {{nation in the world}} and with rural low-income and low food consumption groups still a noticeable portion in the rural area, China has devoted strenuous efforts by utilizing various policy approaches. This paper has estimated empirically the impact of different policy measures, i. e., the predominantly used traditional policy aimed at increasing self-production locally, the “supply” approach, and the pro-market approach of increasing income to purchase more food from market, the “income” approach, on the improvement of food security in disadvantageous regions in rural China, Both Provincial and household data are used in the research, with particular attention paid to regions characterized by low income and low grain production. The results show that with the county’s transition into market system, higher ratio of <b>grain</b> <b>sown</b> area to total cultivate area, as advocated by grain self-sufficiency policy, would hardly lead to improved grain and food consumption for disadvantageous farmers in less-favored regions. On the contrary, it might lead to a worsened food security situation. The increase of income, on the other hand, will help farmers in poor and grain insufficient regions to improve their food security status. It is hoped that the experience from China will help to provide additional evidence for the discussion of policy alternatives for food security for other developing countries.
