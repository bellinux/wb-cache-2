50|$|In the {{laboratory}} it {{is a common}} precipitant and cryoprotectant in protein crystallography. Since <b>hexylene</b> <b>glycol</b> is compatible with polar and nonpolar molecules, it competes with the solvent in a crystallography experiment causing the protein to precipitate. <b>Hexylene</b> <b>glycol</b> is so effective in protein crystallography because its amphiphilic nature and small, flexible structure allows it to bind to many different locations on a protein secondary structure including alpha helices and beta sheets. When <b>hexylene</b> <b>glycol</b> binds to these different locations, water is removed and the protein crystals anneal, which prevents ice formation during cryocrystallography techniques.

40|$|Some {{effects of}} gravity on early {{morphogenesis}} are correlated with microtubule locations within cells. During first cleavage in Ilyanassa obsoleta embryos, a transitory polar lobe constriction forms and then relaxes, allowing the polar lobe {{to merge with}} one daughter cell. If the polar lobe is equally divided or removed, morphogenesis is severely disrupted. To examine microtuble locations during early Ilyanassa development, eggs were fixed and stained for polymerized alpha-tubulin during first cleavage. The mitotic apparatus assembles at the animal pole. The cleavage furrow forms between the asters, constricting to a stabilized intercellular bridge encircling midbody-bound microtubules, whereas the polar lobe constriction forms below and parallel to the spindle, constricting to a transitory intercellular bridge encircling no detectable microtubules. At metaphase an alpha-tubulin epitope is distributed throughout the spindle, whereas a beta-tubulin epitope is present predominantly in the asters. Incubation in <b>hexylene</b> <b>glycol,</b> a drug that increases microtubule polymerization, during mitosis causes the polar lobe constriction to tighten around polymerized alpha-tubulin and remain stably constricted. If <b>hexylene</b> <b>glycol</b> is removed, alpha-tubulin staining disappears from the polar lobe constriction, which relaxes, whereas microtubules remain in the cleavage furrow, which remains constricted. These observations suggest that asymmetric distribution of microtubules affects early Ilyanassa cleavage patterns, and that continued presence of microtubules extending through an intercellular bridge is important for stabilization of the bridge constriction prior to completion of cytokinesis. These data {{provide the basis for}} further analysis of the role of microtubules in possible microgravity disruptions of Ilyanassa development...|$|E

40|$|Astral microtubules (MTs) {{emanating from}} the mitotic {{apparatus}} (MA) during anaphase are required for stimulation of cytokinesis in eggs. We have used green fluorescent protein-labeled EB 1 to observe MT dynamics during mitosis and cytokinesis in normal sea urchin eggs. Analysis of astral MT growth rates during anaphase shows that MTs contact the polar cortex earlier than the equatorial cortex after anaphase onset but that a normal cleavage furrow is not induced until contact with MTs has been achieved throughout the cortex. To assess the role of MT dynamics in initiation of cytokinesis, we used a collection of small molecule drugs to affect dynamics. <b>Hexylene</b> <b>glycol</b> resulted in rapid astral elongation due to decreased MT catastrophe and precocious furrowing.

40|$|Microtubule {{dynamics}} underlie spindle assembly, yet we do {{not know}} how the spindle environment affects these dynamics. We developed methods for measuring two key parameters of microtubule plus-end dynamic instability in Xenopus egg extract spindles. To measure plus-end polymerization rates and localize growing plus ends, we used fluorescence confocal imaging of EB 1. This revealed plus-end polymerization throughout the spindle at ∼ 11 μm/min, similar to astral microtubules, suggesting polymerization velocity is not regionally regulated by the spindle. The ratio of EB 1 to microtubule fluorescence revealed an enrichment of polymerizing ends near the spindle middle, indicating enhanced nucleation or rescue there. We measured depolymerization rates by creating a front of synchronized depolymerization in spindles severed with microneedles. This front could be tracked by polarization and fluorescence microscopy as it advanced from each cut edge toward the associated pole. Both imaging modalities revealed rapid depolymerization (∼ 30 μm/min) superimposed on a subset of microtubules stable to depolymerization. Larger spindle fragments contained a higher percentage of stable microtubules, which we believe were oriented with their minus ends facing the cut. Depolymerization was blocked by the potent microtubule stabilizing agent <b>hexylene</b> <b>glycol,</b> but was unaffected by α-MCAK antibody and AMPPNP, which block catastrophe and kinesin motility, respectively.

40|$|The role of microtubules in the thyrotropin- or {{adenosine}} 3 ', 5 ' cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) -stimulated {{accumulation of}} cytoplasmic colloid droplets and secretion of iodine from the mouse thyroid gland {{has been investigated}} by means of different classes of agents that affect the stabili W of microtubules. The onset of inhibition of secretion by colchicine, the uptake of colchicine-aH by thyroid lobes, and the bindmg of colchicine- 3 H to thyroidal soluble protein are shown to have similar time courses Colloid droplet accumulation is also inhibited and does not readily resume upon removal of colchicine from the medium. This appears {{to be due to}} the slow washout of the drug (t ~- ~ 7 hr). Thvroids contain a soluble colchicine-binding protein that resembles mmrotubule proteins of other tissues with respect to apparent K ~ for colchieine, pH optimum, and stability characterisncs Colchicine analogues inhibit iodine secretion and colchicine binding m a parallel manner and as a function of their antimitotic potencies. Microtubule-stabilizing agents such as <b>hexylene</b> <b>glycol</b> and D 20 also inhibit secretion. Thus, inhibition of thyroid secretion by antimitotic agents appears to be mediated by- an effect on microtubules. The inhiMtory locus of colchicine inhibition occurs after the generation of cyclic AMP, since stimulation of secretion by this nucleotide is blocked by colchicine, whereas thyroid-stimulating hormone-induced accumulation of cyclic AMP is not affected.

Treatment with 0 5 M KC 1 caused loss of 45 % of the birefringence, but microtubules remained intact (as seen electron microscopically in glutaraldehyde-fixed MA), and tubulin was not extracted (as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). These {{results suggest that}} a non-tubulin component which is extracted by the KC 1 contributes 45 % of the MA birefringence. Further evidence for this conclusion came from indirect immunofluorescence experiments. Non-extracted (control) MA were fixed with formaldehyde and reacted with antibody against tubulin: there was intense staining of the spindle fibres and astral rays. Electron microscopi-cally, however, microtubules were not present in formaldehyde-fixed MA. Since formaldehyde fixation caused breakdown of microtubules but the tubulin remained in the MA (as judged by reaction with antibodies) we suggest that after microtubule breakdown the tubulin remains in the MA because it is bound to a peri-microtubule spindle component (which we call ' substance y'). When KCl-extracted MA were fixed with formaldehyde and reacted with antibody against tubulin {{there was very little}} staining of spindle fibres and astral rays. Electron microscopically, formaldehyde caused microtubule breakdown, and since the tubulin is lost from formaldehyde-fixed, KCl-extracted MA (as judged by reaction with antibodies), we suggest that the tubulin-binding component, substance y, is extracted by the 0 5 M KC 1.

40|$|Indomethacin (IND) is {{a potent}} non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug used {{in the treatment of}} rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, acute gout and other disorders. IND is available worldwide mostly in the form of capsules and suppositories, however, these formulations usually create side effects. Consequently, an alternate route of administration to avoid or minimize side effects may be found in the form of semisolid dermatological formulations, now available in few countries. The specific goals of this study were: (I) to determine the solubility of IND using different co-solvents: <b>hexylene</b> <b>glycol</b> (HG), propylene glycol (PG), polyethylene glycol 300 (PEG), butylene glycols (1, 2 BG; 1, 3 BG and 1, 4 BG) and ethanol (ETOH). 1 % (w/w) Tween® 80 or polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP- 25) were used as enhancers; (II) to develop suitable topical gel preparations using 20 % (w/w) Pluronic® (PF- 127) or 1 % (w/w) Carbopol ETD® 2001 (C 2001) as gelling agents and HG or PEG 300 as solvents (1 % (w/w) Tween® 80 and PVP- 25 were added as excipients); (III) To evaluate the effect of composition of prepared gel formulations on the following parameters: appearance, crystallization, pH and rheological behaviour and (IV) to investigate the influence of storage time and storage conditions on the characteristics of the gels. These results indicate that all the solvents tested increased the solubility of IND to varying degrees. Tween® 80 and PVP- 25 only slightly enhanced the solubility of IND. 1 % (w/w) IND was able to form a structural gel with both PF- 127 and C 2001. Storing the INDPF- 127 gels at 6 °C resulted in the precipitation of IND. All gels stored at room temperature exhibited good stability. The gels stored at 45 °C developed a dark yellow colour. Gels with C 2001 and PF- 127 /PEG had slightly decreased viscosities with increasing storage time, while the gels with PF- 127 /HG showed increase in viscosities with time. In conclusion, the water solubility of IND was increased by the addition of co-solvents. 1 % (w/w) IND gel can be suitable for using as a gel formulation and it is stable at room temperature. The search for suitable gels for IND topical formulation needs to be continued with more stability studies.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the template-directed {{synthesis}} of protein/mineral composite materials via a biomimetic approach. Two different systems were developed and further investigated: synthesis of protein/hydroxyapatite composite materials and synthesis of lysozyme/silica composite capsules. Both systems differ {{in the type of}} matrix protein and mineral phase, {{as well as in the}} synthesis procedure but follow the same underlying principle: protein-stabilised o/w emulsions are generally used as templates for hollow mineral capsules in biomimetic synthesis routes under mild conditions. On the basis of an existing synthesis procedure, synthesis of protein/hydroxyapatite composite capsules was refined and further investigated. The formation of protein/hydroxyapatite capsules was performed via a protein-stabilised o/w emulsion. Protein molecules self-assemble at o/w interfaces forming a protein matrix covering the oil droplets. This protein matrix stabilises the oil droplets in aqueous media on the one hand and induces interfacial crystallisation on the other hand. Long synthesis times ensuring sufficient mineralisation were shortened by the use of enzymes (alkaline phosphatases) in combination with a phosphate precursor phase. This procedure enables mineralisation within one week reducing the mineralisation time by the factor six. Changing the synthesis media by buffer addition causes constant pH and therefore optimal enzyme activity increasing capsule yield. Temperature increase up to 37 °C further improves enzyme activity and thus capsule yield. Both soft and hard templates were tested to verify their usability in biomimetic mineralisation. Four organic liquids (perfluorooctane, silicone oil, hexane and styrene) were used as apolar phase and turned out to be applicable as soft templates in the synthesis of hollow mineral capsules. The type of organic liquid in combination with protein folding has an impact on mineralisation causing different capsule surface morphologies. Furthermore, successful mineralisation was performed using hard templates (PTFE substrates, micropatterned superhydrophilic-superhydrophobic substrates and PFDTS-coated silicon wafers) as well. Well-mineralised capsules were synthesised using five different hydrophobins of class I and II (H*Protein A, H*Protein B, TT 1, HFBI and HFBII), κ-casein and fetuin-A as matrix protein. Obtained capsules differ in capsule yield, bulk mineral amount and capsule surface structure. These results demonstrate that this synthesis procedure is not limited to one protein type; moreover, it was shown that capsule morphology can be tuned by the choice of protein type. The mineral phase of the composite hollow capsules consists of calcium phosphate in form of hydroxyapatite. Mineralisation experiments showed that the mineral phase can be altered by low molecular agents (citrate, EDTA, EGTA and HEDTA). Going a step further, successful incorporation of Ag, Au, SiO 2, TiO 2 and ZnO 2 particles (in nm or µm scale) into the mineral phase via Pickering-effect was performed to enable functionality, for instance as catalysts or micro-reactor. Additional interfacial tension measurements were performed in order to gain a deeper understanding of underlying principles of protein self-assembly at interfaces. A second synthesis procedure has been investigated and further developed within this thesis as well. The formation of lysozyme/silica composite capsules was performed via an o/w emulsion stabilised by the enzyme lysozyme. Lysozyme assembles at the o/w interface where it converts the silica precursor phase (apolar phase) to silica. In general, well-mineralised capsules were synthesised with high capsule yields within 1 - 2 days and are stable over at least 30 days. TEOS and PEOS were identified as suitable precursor phases. The type of silica precursor phase alters the capsule surface morphology. The influence of ionic additives (CTAB, SDS and THpmp) as co-stabiliser on droplet stability and silica crystallisation were further investigated. While capsule growth could be obtained in the presence of CTAB and SDS, no capsule formation could be achieved in the presence of THpmp. Since SDS causes protein denaturation, <b>hexylene</b> <b>glycol</b> (MPD) has to be added to synthesis reducing protein-binding affinity of SDS in order to prevent protein denaturation.
