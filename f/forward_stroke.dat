25|$|Acute MI (as {{may occur}} {{due to the}} sudden rupture of a chorda tendinae or {{papillary}} muscle) causes a sudden volume overload of both the left atrium and the left ventricle. The left ventricle develops volume overload because with every contraction it now has to pump out not only the volume of blood {{that goes into the}} aorta (the forward cardiac output or <b>forward</b> <b>stroke</b> volume) but also the blood that regurgitates into the left atrium (the regurgitant volume). The combination of the <b>forward</b> <b>stroke</b> volume and the regurgitant volume is known as the total stroke volume of the left ventricle.|$|E
2500|$|If the MI {{develops}} {{slowly over}} months to years {{or if the}} acute phase cannot be managed with medical therapy, the individual will enter the chronic compensated phase of the disease. [...] In this phase, the left ventricle develops eccentric hypertrophy {{in order to better}} manage the larger than normal stroke volume. [...] The eccentric hypertrophy and the increased diastolic volume combine to increase the stroke volume (to levels well above normal) so that the <b>forward</b> <b>stroke</b> volume (forward cardiac output) approaches the normal levels.|$|E
2500|$|Bowes himself {{recalled}} {{in his autobiography}} that [...] "the penny finally dropped" [...] when he read in a coaching booklet written by Herbert Sutcliffe, {{who was not a}} bowler, that placement of the feet in the delivery stride was key to bowling the outswinger. Bowes experimented and was successful. As Hodgson put it, [...] "once he had included the away (sic) swinger in his armoury, Bowes moved from county to Test-class fast bowler". Kilburn wrote that with his ability [...] "to bowl and control the outswinger, he became more than a fast bowler". His pace was already lively enough and his exceptional height (he was 6 foot 4 inches tall) [...] "enabled him to pitch a length that could draw an unwilling <b>forward</b> <b>stroke</b> yet lift the ball sharply to shoulder of the bat or onto fingers". With two-way swing as well as lift and a judicious use of the bouncer, Bowes simply had [...] "too many weapons for most batsmen playing at county level" [...] and was a considerable handful for Test-class batsmen too.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{come now}} to the measure of policy to which I made allusion at the {{beginning}} of my speech. Your Board has decided to expand your enterprise by purchasing the entire fleet of Pillin & Co., Ltd. By this transaction we become the owners of the four steamships Smyrna, Damascus, Tyre, and Sidon, vessels in prime condition with a total freight-carrying capacity of fifteen thousand tons, at the low inclusive price of sixty thousand pounds. Gentlemen, de l'audace, toujours de l'audace!"--it was the chairman's phrase, his bit of the speech, and the secretary did it more than justice. [...] "Times are bad, but your Board is emphatically of the opinion that they are touching bottom; and this, in their view, is the psychological moment for a <b>forward</b> <b>stroke.</b> They confidently recommend your adoption of their policy and the ratification of this purchase, which they believe will, in the not far distant future, substantially increase the profits of the Company." [...] The secretary sat down with reluctance. The speech should have continued with a number of appealing sentences which he had carefully prepared, but the chairman had cut them out with the simple comment: [...] "They ought to be glad of the chance." [...] It was, in his view, an error.|$|E
6000|$|A gondola is {{in general}} rowed only by one man, {{standing}} at the stern; those of the upper classes having two or more boatmen, for greater speed and magnificence. In order to raise the oar sufficiently, it rests, not {{on the side of}} the boat, but on a piece of crooked timber like the branch of a tree, rising about a foot from the boat's side, and called a [...] "fórcola." [...] The fórcola is of different forms, according to the size and uses of the boat, and it is always somewhat complicated in its parts and curvature, allowing the oar various kinds of rests and catches on both its sides, but perfectly free play in all cases; as the management of the boat depends on the gondolier's being able in an instant to place his oar in any position. The fórcola is set on the right-hand side of the boat, some six feet from the stern: the gondolier stands on a little flat platform or deck behind it, and throws nearly the entire weight of his body upon the <b>forward</b> <b>stroke.</b> The effect of this stroke would be naturally to turn the boat's head round to the left, as well as to send it forward; but this tendency is corrected by keeping the blade of the oar under the water on the return stroke, and raising it gradually, as a full spoon is raised out of any liquid, so that the blade emerges from the water only an instant before it again plunges. A downward and lateral pressure upon the fórcola is thus obtained, which entirely counteracts the tendency given by the forward stroke; and the effort, after a little practice, becomes hardly conscious, though, as it adds some labor to the back stroke, rowing a gondola at speed is hard and breathless work, though it appears easy and graceful to the looker-on.|$|E

50|$|The stay on {{one side}} method is where each canoeist takes {{opposite}} sides and the stern paddler uses occasional J-strokes to correct direction of travel. The side chosen is can {{be based on the}} wind and/or current direction, so the stern paddler's <b>forward</b> <b>strokes</b> are pushing the boat in the opposite direction the wind and/or current is, reducing the number of J-strokes required to keep forward momentum, or sides can be chosen based on the paddlers' stronger side, since this is more comfortable and less tiring. A combination of methods for picking sides can be used, and some canoeists will switch sides after twenty to thirty minutes or longer as a means of lessening muscle fatigue, when changing the direction of the boat, or in response to new weather conditions. Both paddlers must paddle on opposite sides from each other except when trying to turn the boat quickly, or in high winds or strong currents.|$|R
5000|$|Left-to-right alphabets can {{be written}} smudge-free and in proper [...] "forward slant" [...] with the left hand if the paper is turned 1/4 turn {{clockwise}} (90 degrees to the right), and the left hand is drawn toward the body on <b>forward</b> <b>strokes,</b> and left to right on upward strokes (as expressed in directionality of the text). It is also possible to do calligraphy in this posture with the left hand, but using right-handed pen nibs. Otherwise, left-handed pen nibs are {{required in order to}} get the thick-to-thin stroke shapes correct for most type faces, and the left-handed calligrapher is very likely to smudge the text. Left-handed pen nibs are not generally easy to find, and strokes may have to be done backwards from traditional right-handed calligraphic work rules to avoid nib jamming and splatter. Left-handed people have an advantage in learning 19th-century copperplate hands, which control line-width by pressure on the point.|$|R
50|$|A simple pump has a cupped fiber {{or plastic}} piston. On the <b>forward</b> <b>stroke</b> the air pushes {{the sides of}} the cup against the cylinder, so forming a seal; it {{provides}} its own valve. Then this piston can push the air out of the hole at the far end.|$|E
5000|$|Boof - The boof {{is likely}} the most creeking-centric paddle stroke, {{but can be}} used on rivers from time to time. The boof move is used to take the boater away from the base of a drop, and to also allow the boater to land a drop flat and in control instead of nose first. To perform the move the boater needs to time a {{powerful}} <b>forward</b> <b>stroke</b> at the lip of the drop. As they are pulling on their <b>forward</b> <b>stroke</b> they need to use their stomach muscles to pull their toes up, and as the paddle passes by their hips they will continue the stroke further than normal, pushing their body as far away from the lip as possible while keeping their toes high. In a canoe, the boof is similar.|$|E

40|$|Many {{micro-organisms}} swim through gels and non-Newtonian fluids {{in their}} natural environments. In this paper, we focus on micro-organisms which use flagella for propulsion. We address how swimming velocities are affected in nonlinearly viscoelastic fluids by examining the problem of an infinitely long cylinder with arbitrary beating motion in the Oldroyd-B fluid. We solve for the swimming velocity in the limit in which deflections of the cylinder from its straight configuration are small relative to the radius of the cylinder and the wavelength of the deflections; furthermore, the radius of the cylinder is small compared to the wavelength of deflections. We find that swimming velocities are diminished by nonlinear viscoelastic effects. We apply these results to examine what types of swimming motions can produce net translation in a nonlinear fluid, comparing to the Newtonian case, for which Purcell’s “scallop” theorem describes how time-reversibility constrains which swimming motions are effective. We find that a leading order violation of the scallop theorem occurs for reciprocal motions in which the backward and <b>forward</b> <b>strokes</b> occur at different rates...|$|R

50|$|An air-blunt {{is similar}} to the blunt in set up but a much bigger move in magnitude. On a smaller wave the kayaker will start {{at the top of the}} wave and then while {{accelerating}} into the trough they will give an aggressive <b>forward</b> <b>stroke</b> on one side of their boat while driving their bow down into the water on the same side. After this drive and push the kayaker will lean back to neutral and over to the other side of their boat putting their paddle under their bum on the side of the boat opposite from the previous <b>forward</b> <b>stroke.</b> This action will force the bottom of their boat into the air, and if the initial bow drive was hard enough their toes will resurface, and the entire boat will be airborne, giving it the distinction of an Air-Blunt. The finishing of the move is for the kayaker to move the bow of their boat towards the blade that is currently engaged in the water. The bow of the boat will hit the water and the stern of the boat will come from over the kayakers head, to behind him is a quick motion, leaving the kayaker back surfing. If the kayaker keeps rotating the boat over their body they Pan-Am. On a larger wave the blunt can be initiated by a bounce, without <b>forward</b> <b>stroke</b> or carve.|$|E
50|$|A {{gear shaper}} is a machine tool for cutting {{the teeth of}} {{internal}} or external gears.

50|$|The <b>forward</b> <b>stroke</b> is {{the most}} {{intuitive}} paddle stroke in kayaking although proper technique is important to master. To do a <b>forward</b> <b>stroke</b> the paddler holds his paddle vertically, with one hand close to the face, and the other hand outstretched outside of the knee. The paddle enters the water near the toes of the paddler, and the paddle is pushed out with the upper hand and pulled in with the lower hand, keeping the paddle vertical. To incorporate {{more than just the}} arms and upper back, paddlers should twist their torsos to reach and twist back while pulling to maximize their reach and power. The blade should leave the water by the paddlers' hips, and the low hand comes up to the face, with the face hand reaching out to outside the knee on its side in order to initiate the next stroke.|$|E
