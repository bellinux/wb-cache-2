5|$|It {{must seem}} {{to the reader}} that this Colonel Beriah Norton was a traitor to his own people, but what could <b>he</b> <b>do</b> but give in to Grey's command! Grey had the force and the power and could have {{destroyed}} the towns on the island in half a day, and would have done so if they had resisted in any way. In the diary, September 12th and 13th are omitted. Those were {{the days when the}} British troops were ravaging the island from Edgartown to Gay Head.|$|E
5|$|In September, Oliver Hazard Perry {{destroyed}} {{most of the}} British fleet at the Battle of Lake Erie, {{taking control}} of the lake. This put the British army, then at Fort Malden (now Amherstburg, Ontario) out of supply, and threatened to cut it {{off from the rest of}} Canada by a landing to the east. The British, under General Henry Procter, withdrew to the northeast, followed by Harrison, who had advanced through Michigan while Johnson kept the Indians engaged. The Indian chiefTecumseh and his tribe, hired as mercenaries, covered the British retreat, but were countered by Johnson, who had been called back from a raid on Kaskaskia that had taken the post where the British had distributed arms and money to their hired Indians.. Johnson's cavalry defeated Tecumseh's main force on September 29, took British supply trains on October 3, and was one of the factors inducing Procter to stand and fight at the Battle of the Thames on October 5, as Tecumseh had been demanding <b>he</b> <b>do.</b> One of Johnson's slaves, Daniel Chinn, accompanied Johnson to the battle.|$|E
5|$|Just {{weeks after}} Letcher's inauguration, William Henry Harrison {{prevailed in the}} 1840 presidential election. Soon after, Harrison visited Letcher in Frankfort to discuss the {{appointment}} of Letcher's friend John J. Crittenden to Harrison's cabinet. On December 14, 1840, Letcher wrote Crittenden {{to tell him that}} the General Assembly would shortly re-elect him to his Senate seat. If he (Crittenden) were going to accept a position in President Harrison's cabinet, Letcher would prefer <b>he</b> <b>do</b> it before March 4, 1841 so the General Assembly would still be in session to elect Crittenden's replacement in the Senate. On January 11, 1841, Crittenden replied that he expected to be named attorney general and believed he could accept the post before Letcher's preferred deadline. However, due to Harrison's death only a month after his inauguration, Crittenden was not able to keep Letcher's timeline; he was appointed attorney general by John Tyler on March 5, 1841.|$|E
60|$|These {{questions}} disturbed Prothero. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> not shoot, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not hunt, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{not go to}} Scotland for the grouse, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not belong, and Lady Marayne {{ought to}} have seen that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{not belong to the}} class that does these things.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>did</b> go to Warminster. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> {{call on the}} Doctor, who was not at home;--and <b>he</b> <b>did</b> call also upon Mr. Jay, who was at home.|$|R

25|$|But Naaman's {{servants}} {{advised him}} that if Elisha had directed him to do some difficult thing {{he would have done}} it, so how much more should <b>he</b> <b>do</b> what Elisha directed when he said merely to wash and be clean. So Naaman dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, and his flesh came back like the flesh of a little child.|$|E
25|$|Though Booth {{became a}} {{prominent}} Methodist evangelist, he was unhappy that the {{annual conference of}} the denomination kept assigning him to a pastorate, the duties of which he had to neglect to respond to the frequent requests that <b>he</b> <b>do</b> evangelistic campaigns. At the Liverpool conference in 1861, after having spent three years at Gateshead, his request to be freed for evangelism full-time was refused yet again, and Booth resigned from the ministry of the Methodist New Connexion.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, Manser {{went on a}} 60-day {{hunger strike}} at the Federal Palace of Switzerland ('"Bundeshaus") to press the Swiss {{parliament}} on enforcing a ban on tropical timber imports and mandatory declarations of timber products. The hunger strike was supported by 37 organisations and political parties. Manser only stopped the hunger strike after his mother requested that <b>he</b> <b>do</b> so. After Manser's disappearance, the Swiss parliament finally adopted the Declaration of Timber Products on 1 October 2010, with a transition period allowed until the end 2011.|$|E
60|$|Alec looked down, but <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not say anything. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> not move.|$|R
50|$|He was a {{very modest}} person, who insisted that even the {{ordinary}} plumber or electrician knows more about his craft than <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> <b>He</b> {{said he could not}} explain how <b>he</b> <b>did</b> what <b>he</b> <b>did</b> on the field of play, and that he just followed his instincts.|$|R
60|$|But <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not heed, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not hear. His {{brain was}} solid and dead.|$|R
25|$|By 1871, Whistler {{returned}} to portraits and soon produced {{his most famous}} painting, the nearly monochromatic full-length figure entitled Arrangement in Grey and Black No.1, but usually (and incorrectly) referred to as Whistler's Mother. A model failed to appear one day, according to a letter from his mother, so Whistler turned {{to his mother and}} suggested that <b>he</b> <b>do</b> her portrait. In his typically slow and experimental way, at first he had her stand, but that proved too tiring so the famous seated pose was adopted. It took dozens of sittings to complete.|$|E
25|$|Risto Ryti was a Freemason, {{but after}} his prison sentence, was {{required}} to give up membership in his lodge, as convicts were barred from membership. He had become a Freemason in 1924, {{but according to the}} Finnish Grand Lodge's assistant grand scribe Reijo Ahtokari, he did not very actively participate in Masonic activities. Historians are still skeptical as to whether Ryti's Freemasonry influenced his political actions. In January 1941, for example, he appointed a fellow Freemason, Jukka W. Rangell, as prime minister only after his secretary Lauri Puntila suggested that <b>he</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E
25|$|Mills {{was born}} in St. Stephen, New Brunswick in January 1923. He {{attended}} Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick. Trained {{from the age of}} 7 in music, he became a concert pianist, with debuts in Toronto in 1952 and New York City in 1961. Though he chose to end his career as a concert pianist in 1963, he concentrated on teaching piano and adjudicating young musicians for another ten years. Living in Toronto, he began speaking spontaneously to those who requested that <b>he</b> <b>do</b> so, ultimately offering many thousands of hours of metaphysical/philosophical lectures and meetings over his lifetime.|$|E

50|$|<b>He</b> <b>did</b> his BS and Master in {{microbiology}} from Karachi University. After this <b>he</b> <b>did</b> two master in Education. One in {{executive and}} second in administration from USA. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> his Ph.D in Educational Psychology from the Washington International University USA.|$|R
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>did</b> not exercise, with {{reasonable}} {{competence in the}} given case, the skill which <b>he</b> <b>did</b> possess.|$|R
25|$|Haig {{preferred}} {{to continue the}} offensive, encouraged by Plumer's recent successful attacks in dry weather at Menin Road (20 September) and Polygon Wood (26 September), and stating that the Germans were “very worn out”. Robertson spoke to the Army Commanders, but declined Haig’s offer that <b>he</b> <b>do</b> so without Haig present. He later regretted not having done so, although {{he was aware of}} the ill-feeling which Painlevé had caused when he asked Nivelle's subordinates to criticise him. He later wrote in his memoirs that “I was not prepared to carry my doubts to the point of opposing (Haig)” or of preventing one more push which might have “convert(ed) an inconclusive battle into a decisive victory”.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} eleven seasons of their {{existence}} in the NBA, the Suns had no official mascot, but some years later this mascot was born by accident. A messenger for Eastern Onion, a singing telegram service, came to the Coliseum during a home game dressed as a gorilla. As he left, Coliseum security suggested <b>he</b> <b>do</b> a few dances underneath the basket during a timeout and the fans loved it. So did the messenger, who kept coming to games until he was officially invited {{to be part of}} the team. And this is how this mascot was accidentally born. The messenger, a quiet young man named Henry Rojas, was anything but quiet in his costume. An early attempt was made involving a sunflower costume, but it never caught on. Given a Suns warm-up jacket, Rojas shed his shyness, and turned into an entertainment beast, dancing, joking with fans and, in general, enjoying himself to the fullest. Nowadays, the Suns Gorilla is one of the most famous mascots in the NBA.|$|E
25|$|Lawrence Cook {{emerged in}} 1907 as a bowler of fast-medium pace, {{possibly}} meant {{to substitute for}} Walter Brearley who was then engaged {{in one of his}} many disputes with the Lancashire committee. Although he took a wicket with his first ball in first-class cricket, on the whole his record for that season was moderate, but with seven wickets on a rare hard pitch against Kent at Canterbury he showed he had great persistence. When Brearley came back into the eleven in 1908, Cook was relegated to the Second Eleven, but in 1910 he re-established in place and in the May following year, helped by a bad pitch and feeble Northamptonshire batting, he bowled with considerable pace and a lot of spin to take eight wickets for 39 runs. Cook indeed bowled so well early that season that Lancashire seemed to have found an excellent pace bowler when Brearley could not play. However, he was felt impossible to fit in when that fast bowler was free from business and on returning to the side he did not maintain his early season form, nor did <b>he</b> <b>do</b> anything of note against the top counties.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, BBC One {{broadcast}} {{an adaptation}} for the ShakespeaRe-Told series, written by Sally Wainwright {{and directed by}} David Richards. Written in modern prose, the episode relocates the story to contemporary London, where Katherine (Shirley Henderson) is an abrasive career politician who is told she must find a husband {{if she wants to}} become the party leader. Meanwhile, her supermodel sister Bianca (Jaime Murray) has fallen in love with Lucentio (Santiago Cabrera) and wants to marry him, but Bianca's manager, Harry (Stephen Tompkinson), has long believed she will marry him. To put him off, Bianca announces she will not marry until her sister is married (as she believes Katherine will never marry). Harry then arranges a meeting between his friend Petruchio (Rufus Sewell) and Katherine. Harry bets Petruchio that he {{will not be able to}} woo Katherine, so, determined to prove him wrong, Petruchio sets out to win her over. At the end of the episode, Katherine's 'submission' speech is triggered when Bianca is annoyed that Lucentio refuses to sign a pre-nuptial agreement. Katherine states it is a woman's duty to love and obey her husband, but with the requirement that <b>he</b> <b>do</b> precisely the same for her. In 2009, ABC Family adapted the 1999 film 10 Things I Hate About You as a sitcom of the same name, starring Lindsey Shaw and Ethan Peck.|$|E
500|$|Youkilis hit a {{walk off}} home run against the Yankees on April 24, 2009. [...] "He has skills, man", said David Ortiz. [...] "I don't know how <b>he</b> <b>do</b> it. He just do it." [...] He was {{subsequently}} {{placed on the}} disabled list a few days later, but returned to play on May 20. [...] "It's frustrating not being able to play", he said. [...] "Watching baseball is not something I like to do." ...|$|E
500|$|Sumner largely {{acted as}} the band's director, a role he {{continued}} in New Order. While Sumner was the group's primary guitarist, Curtis played the instrument {{on a few}} recorded songs and during a few shows. Curtis hated playing guitar, but the band insisted <b>he</b> <b>do</b> so. Sumner said, [...] "He played in quite a bizarre way and that to us was interesting, {{because no one else}} would play like Ian". During the recording sessions for Closer, Sumner began using self-built synthesisers and Hook used a six-string bass for more melody.|$|E

6000|$|But no matter. Nothing {{would have}} come of it, for <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not care for flowers. He called them rubbish, and cannot tell one from another, and thinks it is {{superior}} to feel like that. <b>He</b> <b>does</b> not care for me, <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not care for flowers, <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not care for the painted sky at eventide--is there anything <b>he</b> <b>does</b> care for, except building shacks to coop himself up in from the good clean rain, and thumping the melons, and sampling the grapes, and fingering the fruit on the trees, to see how those properties are coming along? ...|$|R
500|$|Health workers {{played an}} {{important}} role in documenting the injuries, which were at the time downplayed or denied by the government of Bahrain. Rheumatologist Fatima Haji, for example, appeared on Al Jazeera television news in a [...] "hysterical" [...] state, describing Isa Abdul Hasan, a man in his 60s who died in her hospital of a head wound he had received from police: [...] "I just started shouting: 'What the hell did this guy do, he was an old man. What did <b>he</b> <b>do</b> to deserve this?'" [...] She later stated that following her arrest, her interrogations were centered on this television appearance.|$|E
500|$|By 1924, many UFA Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) {{wanted to}} see Greenfield leave office, both because they were {{frustrated}} with his failings and because they thought it likely that a Greenfield-led government would be defeated in the next election. [...] Their first attempt to replace him failed when Brownlee, their intended replacement, refused {{to have anything to}} do with the plan, but a second attempt, in 1925, was successful when Brownlee agreed to take office if Greenfield personally requested that <b>he</b> <b>do</b> so. [...] Greenfield had not wanted the job in the first place, and agreed to resign in Brownlee's favour.|$|E
500|$|In a 1971 {{letter to}} Paul McCartney, Lennon wrote, [...] "When {{people ask me}} {{questions}} about 'What did George Martin really do for you?,' I have only one answer, 'What does <b>he</b> <b>do</b> now?' I noticed you had no answer for that! It's not a putdown, it's the truth." [...] Lennon wrote that Martin took too much credit for the Beatles' music. Commenting specifically on [...] "Revolution 9", Lennon said with ironic authority, [...] "For Martin to state that he was 'painting a sound picture' is pure hallucination. Ask {{any of the other}} people involved. The final editing Yoko and I did alone." ...|$|E

50|$|On August 19, 1938, Latchford {{was named}} the Chief of the State Department's Aviation Section.
