While an <b>inband</b> T1 seemingly has a slight advantage due to 24 lines being available to make calls (as opposed to a PRI that has 23), each channel in an <b>inband</b> T1 must perform its own setup and tear-down of each call. A PRI uses the 24th channel as a data channel to perform all the overhead operations of the other 23 channels (including CID and ANI). Although an <b>inband</b> T1 has 24 channels, the 23 channel PRI can set up more calls faster due to the dedicated 24th signalling channel (D Channel).|$|E

In the middle 20th century, supervision signals on long-distance trunks in North America were usually <b>inband,</b> for example at 2600 Hz, necessitating a notch filter to prevent interference. Late in the century, all supervisory signals were out of band. With the advent of digital trunks, supervision signals are carried by robbed bits or other bits in the E1-carrier dedicated to signaling.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} the use of push-buttons in {{telephony}} originated around 1887 with a device called the micro-telephone push-button, but it was not an automatic dialing system as understood later. This use even predated the invention of the rotary dial by Almon Brown Strowger in 1891. The Bell System in the United States relied on manual switched service until 1919, when it reversed its decisions and embraced dialed, automatic switching. The 1951 introduction of direct distance dialing required automatic transmission of dialed numbers between distant exchanges, leading to use of <b>inband</b> multi-frequency signaling within the Long Lines network while individual local subscribers continued to dial using standard pulses.|$|E

50|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, some trunks were {{modified}} {{to filter out}} single frequency tones arriving from a caller. The death of blueboxing came {{in the mid to}} late 1990s when telcos, becoming aware of the problem, eventually moved to out-of-band signaling systems with separate data and signalling channels (such as CCIS and SS7). These systems separated the voice and signaling channels, making it impossible to generate signalling signals from an ordinary voice phone line. It is rumored that some international trunks still utilize in-band signaling and are susceptible to tones, although often it is 2600+2400 Hz then 2400 Hz to seize. Sometimes the initial tone is a composition of three frequencies. A given country may have <b>inband</b> signalling on trunks from a specific country but not others.|$|E
5000|$|Selcall (Selective Calling) transmits a {{burst of}} up to five <b>inband</b> audio tones at the {{beginning}} of each transmission. This feature (sometimes called [...] "tone burst") is common in European systems. Early systems used one tone (commonly called [...] "Tone Burst"). Several tones were used, the most common being 1,750 Hz, which is still used in European amateur radio repeater systems. The addressing scheme provided by one tone was not enough, so a two tone system was devised - one tone followed by a second tone (sometimes called a [...] "1+1" [...] system). Later on, Motorola marketed a system called [...] "Quik-Call" [...] that used two simultaneous tones followed by two more simultaneous tones (sometimes called a [...] "2+2" [...] system) that was heavily used by fire department dispatch systems in the USA. Later selective call systems used paging system technology that made use of five sequential tones. In the same way that a single CTCSS tone would be used on an entire group of radios, a single five-tone sequence is used in a group of radios.|$|E

30|$|<b>Inband</b> {{full-duplex}} communications is {{a promising}} candidate technology for further improving the spectral {{efficiency of the}} next generation wireless systems, such as the 5 G networks [1 – 11]. The basic idea behind it is to transmit and receive at the same time at the same center-frequency, thereby in principle doubling the spectral efficiency. The drawback of such <b>inband</b> full-duplex operation is the own transmit signal, which is coupling to the receiver and becomes an extremely powerful source of self-interference (SI). The most significant challenge in implementing <b>inband</b> full-duplex radios in practice is thereby the development of SI cancellation solutions, which are capable of removing the SI in the receiver. There are already reports of various demonstrator implementations, which achieve relatively high SI cancellation performance, thereby allowing for true <b>inband</b> full-duplex operation [1 – 3, 6, 7, 11 – 14].|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a fully orthogonal frequency-selective baseband predistortion linearization system for RF multi-carrier power amplifiers (PA) affected by strong differential memory effects. A new scheme is introduced for removing the unwanted <b>inband</b> frequency components {{generated by the}} interband predistortion corrections, thus establishing full orthog-onality between the interband and <b>inband</b> predistortion. The demonstration study is performed on a two-carrier OFDM signal of 8 MHz bandwidth each, separated by 16 MHz for a total RF bandwidth of 32 MHz. Both the OFDM signal generator and the new orthogonal multi-carrier linearization algorithm proposed were implemented in a {{field programmable gate array}} (FPGA) and applied to the experimental investigation of the linearization of a Class AB/Class C LDMOS PA at 3. 5 GHz. It is demonstrated that with the new orthogonality implementation, 5 dB <b>inband</b> distortion introduced by the interband predistortion steps is automatically suppressed such that multiple iterative steps between the interband and <b>inband</b> linearizations are no longer required in the optimization. Adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) of up to- 45 dBc for <b>inband</b> and interband are demonstrated experimentally.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a frequency-selective RF vector predistortion linearization system for RF multicarrier power am-plifiers (PAs) affected by strong differential memory effects. Differ-ential memory {{effects can be}} revealed in two-tone experiment by the divergence for increasing tone-spacing of the vector Volterra coeffi-cients associated with the lower and upper intermodulations tones. Using large-signal vector measurement with a large-singal network analyzer, a class-AB LDMOS RF PA is demonstrated to exhibit a strong differential memory effect for modulation bandwidth above 0. 3 MHz. New frequency-selective RF and baseband predistortion linearization algorithms are proposed to separately address the lin-earization requirements of the interband and <b>inband</b> intermodula-tion products of both the lower and upper sidebands.
