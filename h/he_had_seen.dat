5|$|Kelly {{was known}} as an {{excellent}} defensive first baseman. His positioning and footwork on hits to the outfield became the standard method for teaching future first basemen to handle relays. Frisch considered Kelly the finest first baseman <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before Ladas ran as a three-year-old, Mat Dawson, who {{had been}} {{training}} horses, including more than twenty classic winners since the 1850s, {{was reported to have}} called Ladas the best he had ever trained. Later that season he ranked him second, slightly behind St. Simon. Henry Chaplin, the owner of Hermit, called Ladas the finest horse <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen.</b>|$|E

Bindrich {{refused to accept the}} penalty and withdrew from the tournament shortly after, and went on to blog about the double standards of arbiters, claiming that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> several other players arrive late in the previous rounds, and no penalty was issued to them.|$|E
5|$|Elves {{sometimes}} {{appear to}} age under great stress. Círdan {{appeared to be}} aged himself, since he is described as looking old, save for the stars in his eyes; {{this may be due}} to all the sorrows <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> and lived through since the First Age. Also, the people of Gwindor of Nargothrond had trouble recognizing him after his time as a prisoner of Morgoth.|$|E
5|$|For {{some time}} Butlin had nurtured {{the idea of}} a holiday camp. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> the way landladies in seaside resorts would, {{sometimes}} literally, push families out of the lodgings between meals, regardless of the weather. Butlin {{toyed with the idea of}} providing holiday accommodation that encouraged holiday-makers to stay on the site and even provided entertainment for them between meals.|$|E

Randi writes that one-octave mouth organs were found in Home's belongings after his death. According to Randi 'around 1960' William Lindsay Gresham told Randi <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> these mouth organs in the Home collection at the Society for Psychical Research.|$|E
5|$|The chain {{was founded}} by Tim Waterstone after he was fired by WHSmith, having failed to {{establish}} WHSmith as a brand in the United States. Taking the £6000 redundancy payout, he set up his first store in Old Brompton Road, Kensington with the ambition of creating a 'different breed of bookshop', using techniques <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> in the United States. He used literary authors in front of store displays and employed highly literate staff.|$|E

Van Hoorn had known the Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh, who lived in nearby Nuenen from 1883 until 1885. Van Gogh painted several paintings around the mill, including an 1884 painting of the mill itself, Water Mill at Opwetten (F48). In a video interview in 1973, Van Hoorn said that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> Van Gogh paint and had supplied him with bird nests for his paintings.|$|E
50|$|Reliabilism {{has been}} {{challenged}} by Gettier cases. Another argument that challenges reliabilism, like the Gettier cases (although it was not presented in the same short article as the Gettier cases), {{is the case of}} Henry and the barn façades. In the thought experiment, a man, Henry, is driving along and sees a number of buildings that resemble barns. Based on his perception of one of these, he concludes that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> just <b>seen</b> barns. While <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> one, and the perception he based his belief that the one he saw was of a real barn, all the other barn-like buildings he saw were façades. Theoretically, Henry does not know that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> a barn, despite both his belief that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> one being true and his belief being formed {{on the basis of a}} reliable process (i.e. his vision), since he only acquired his true belief by accident.|$|R

5|$|Alternatively, Lindemann {{may have}} left his combat {{position}} when the ship's controls were rendered inoperable, and {{prior to the}} lethal hit on the command position, {{in order to give}} the command to abandon the ship. The surviving Matrose Paul Hillen—who had managed to escape to the upper deck in the final phase of the battle, stated that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> a group of 20–30 people standing at the bow, among them a man with a white peaked cap. Normally on a German naval vessel at sea, a white cap is worn only by the commanding officer. In addition, the surviving Maschinengefreiter—Rudolf Römer, who at the time was already in the water—claimed that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> Lindemann standing on the bow, near Bismarcks forward 38cm turret, Anton. He was said to be with his combat messenger, a leading seaman, and apparently trying to persuade his messenger to save himself. In this account, his messenger took Lindemann's hand and the two walked to the forward flagmast. As the ship turned over, the two stood briefly to attention, then Lindemann and his messenger saluted. As the ship rolled to port, the messenger fell into the water. Lindemann continued his salute while clinging to the flagmast, going under with the ship.|$|E
5|$|Back at her apartment, Scully runs a {{background}} check of Doggett on her computer, learning about his background as a former NYPD detective. She feels sick and leaves the computer, and later on calls her mom, Margaret (Sheila Larken). When she realizes her phone is tapped, she looks outside {{the window to see}} if anyone is out there. She angrily calls Doggett to protest him monitoring her phone conversations, which he seems genuinely surprised about. She notices a mysterious man and runs into the hall to pursue him, but meets her landlord Mr. Coeben who tells her that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> Mulder.|$|E
5|$|Bewick's last wood engraving, Waiting for Death, was {{of an old}} bony workhorse, {{standing}} forlorn by a tree stump, which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> and sketched as an apprentice; {{the work}} echoes William Hogarth's last work, The Bathos, which shows the fallen artist by a broken column. He died after a few days' illness on 8 November 1828, at his home. He was buried in Ovingham churchyard, beside his wife Isabella, who had died two years earlier, and not far from his parents and his brother John.|$|E

5|$|Driven {{by early}} {{enjoyment}} of the media coverage of cricket, Agnew developed a love for playing the game. At the end of days spent watching cricket on television in a blacked-out room with the commentary provided by the radio, Agnew {{would go into the}} garden and practise his bowling for hours, trying to imitate the players <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen.</b> Agnew's father, an amateur cricketer, taught him the rudiments of the sport, including an offspin action, as he wanted his son to develop into a bowler like him. Another family connection to cricket was his first cousin, Mary Duggan, who was a women's Test player for England from 1948 to 1963.|$|E
5|$|Edward I {{became the}} king of England in 1272. Edward had {{extensive}} experience of warfare and sieges, having fought in Wales in 1257, led the six-month siege of Kenilworth Castle in 1266 and joined the crusade to North Africa in 1270. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> numerous European fortifications, including the planned walled town and castle design at Aigues-Mortes. On assuming the throne, one of Edward's first actions was to renovate and extend the royal fortress of the Tower of London. Edward was also responsible for building a sequence of planned, usually walled, towns called bastides across Gascony {{as part of his}} attempt to strengthen his authority in the region. Edward also authorised new planned towns to be built across England.|$|E

But when the Colorado legislature acknowledged the complaints of organized labor and passed an eight hour law, the Colorado supreme court declared it unconstitutional. So the WFM took the issue to the voters, and 72 percent of the state's voters approved the referendum. But the Colorado government ignored the results of the referendum.|$|E
