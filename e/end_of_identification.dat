60|$|There is {{for example}} this {{practical}} identity of religious feeling and this discrepancy of interpretation between such an inquirer as myself and a convert of the Salvation Army. Here, clothing itself in phrases {{and images of}} barbaric sacrifice, of slaughtered lambs and fountains of precious blood, a most repulsive and incomprehensible idiom to me, and expressing itself by shouts, clangour, trumpeting, gesticulations, and rhythmic pacings that stun and dismay my nerves, I find, the same object sought, release from self, and the same end, the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> with the immortal, successfully if perhaps rather insecurely achieved. I see God indubitably present in these excitements, and I see personalities I could easily have misjudged as too base or too dense for spiritual understandings, lit by the manifest reflection of divinity. One may be led into the absurdest underestimates of religious possibilities if one estimates people only coldly and {{in the light of}} everyday life. There is a sub-intellectual religious life which, very conceivably, when its utmost range can be examined, excludes nothing human from religious cooperation, which will use any words to its tune, which takes its phrasing ready-made from the world about it, as it takes the street for its temple, and yet which may be at its inner point in the directest contact with God. Religion may suffer from aphasia and still be religion; it may utter misleading or nonsensical words and yet intend and convey the truth. The methods of the Salvation Army are older than doctrinal Christianity, and may long survive it. Men and women may still chant of Beulah Land and cry out in the ecstasy of salvation; the tambourine, that modern revival of the thrilling Alexandrine sistrum, may still stir dull nerves to a first apprehension of powers and a call beyond the immediate material compulsion of life, when the creeds of Christianity are as dead as the lore of the Druids.|$|E

40|$|This article evaluates two {{divergent}} {{views of}} the future <b>of</b> occupation <b>identification</b> by core industry employees. The first asserts that occupational identities are waning as identity-challenging managerial techniques reshape classic worker identities. The sec-ond contends that frontline workers are developing new repertoires of resistance that sustain robust occupational identities. Underlying these views, respectively, is an implicit teleology and a cyclical notion of labour history that posits trade unions as the locus of identity formation and resistance. Contemporary instances <b>of</b> occupational <b>identification</b> render these assumptions problematical. Drawing from an underground coalmining industry case study, we show how miners achieve a shared occupational identity through narrative resistance to individuating managerial techniques.

To that <b>end,</b> <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> the associated allergen is important for facilitating both education and allergen avoidance that are essential to long-term risk reduction. As the number of known exposures associated with anaphylaxis is limited, discovery of novel causative agents is crucial to evaluation and management of patients with idiopathic anaphylaxis. Within the last 10 years several apparently separate observations were recognized to be related, all of which resulted from the development of antibodies to a carbohydrate moiety on proteins. Interestingly, the exposure differed from airborne allergens but was nevertheless capable of producing anaphylactic and hypersensitivity reactions. Our recent work has identified these responses as being due to a novel IgE antibody directed against a mammalian oligosaccharide epitope, galactose-alpha- 1, 3 -galactose (“alpha-gal”).

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} symmetry-based {{approach}} {{which can be used}} to detect humans and to extract biometric characteristics from video image-sequences. The method employs a simplified symmetry-feature extracted from the images. To obtain a useful descriptor of a walking person, we track temporally the symmetries which result from the movements of the person's legs. In a further processing stage these patterns are filtered, then re-sampled using Bezier-splines to generate an invariant and noise-cleaned signature or “feature”. In our detection method the extracted spatio-temporal feature with a large number of dimensions (800) is transformed to a space with a much smaller number of dimensions (3), which we call the “eigenwalks space”; the method uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality, and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method in the eigenspace for recognition purposes.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} {{the prevalence of}} spondyloarthritis and its subtypes. METHODS: The Swedish healthcare organisation comprises a system where all inpatient and outpatient care is registered by a personal identifier. For the calendar years 2003 - 7, all residents aged ≥ 15 years in the southernmost county of Sweden (1. 2 million inhabitants) diagnosed by a physician with spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), inflammatory arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease (Aa-IBD) or undifferentiated spondylarthritis (USpA)) were identified. To obtain valid point estimates of prevalence by the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> 2007, <b>identification</b> numbers were cross-referenced with the population register to exclude patients who had died or relocated. RESULTS: The authors estimated the prevalence of spondyloarthritis (not including chronic reactive arthritis) as 0. 45 % (95 % CI 0. 44 % to 0. 47 %). The mean (SD) age of patients with prevalent spondyloarthritis by the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> 2007 was 53 (15) years. Among the component subtypes, PsA accounted for 54 % of cases, AS 21. 4 %, USpA 17. 8 % and Aa-IBD 2. 3 % with a prevalence of 0. 25 %, 0. 12 %, 0. 10 % and 0. 015 %, respectively. The remaining 6. 4 % had some form of combination of spondyloarthritis diagnoses. The prevalence of spondyloarthritis at large {{was about the same}} in men and women. However, the subtype PsA was more prevalent in women and AS was more prevalent in men.
