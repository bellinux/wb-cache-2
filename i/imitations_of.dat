5|$|Military {{camouflage}} patterns {{have been}} popular in fashion and art from {{as early as}} 1915. Camouflage patterns {{have appeared in the}} work of artists such as Andy Warhol and Ian Hamilton Finlay, sometimes with an anti-war message. In fashion, many major designers have exploited camouflage's style and symbolism, and military clothing or <b>imitations</b> <b>of</b> it have been used both as street wear and as a symbol of political protest.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{theological}} investigation <b>of</b> the <b>Imitation</b> <b>of</b> Christ. It {{is a study}} <b>of</b> the <b>Imitation</b> <b>of</b> Christ as a theological theme as it occurs in Christian theology. The theme <b>of</b> the <b>Imitation</b> <b>of</b> Christ is investigated in two areas, that of Christian theology in general {{in the first and}} larger section of the thesis, and that of the theology of Dietrich Bonhoeffer in the second section. In the first section, the <b>Imitation</b> <b>of</b> Christ is studied in the following ways. The various strands <b>of</b> the <b>Imitation</b> tradition are analysed, the <b>Imitation</b> <b>of</b> Christ is studied as an instance of the human practice <b>of</b> <b>Imitation,</b> the Christological issues are investigated, as also is the relationship between Imitation and Christian theology. In the second section Bonhoeffer's notion <b>of</b> the <b>Imitation</b> <b>of</b> Christ is studied {{in the light of the}} issues raised in the first section. Thus Bonhoeffer's place in the Imitation tradition is assessed, and more light shed on the nature <b>of</b> the <b>Imitation</b> <b>of</b> Christ...|$|R

5|$|Bronze mirrors {{arrived to}} Japan from China {{as early as}} the Yayoi period and {{continued}} to be imported through the Tang Dynasty (618–907). During that period mirrors cast in Japan were <b>imitations</b> <b>of</b> Chinese prototypes and subsequently Japanese designs were established. All of these mirrors were generally circular, with a polished front, and a back decorated with molded or engraved reliefs, sometimes inlaid with gold or silver. Three mirrors or sets of mirrors decorated with floral and animal motifs have been designated as National Treasures.|$|E
5|$|Cave 2 {{is similar}} to cave 1 in design. The veranda has two pillars and two {{pilaster}}s, a bench between each pillar and pilaster with curtains in the back, which have a rail pattern. Over the pillars rests the rail-patterned rock beam, above which is the ceiling. Parts of the pillars and pilasters are broken. In front over the beam project rock <b>imitations</b> <b>of</b> rafters. A doorway with grooves for a wooden frame, leads into a middle room, with a bench along the left wall. The position of the hall-cell and cell are exchanged with respect to cave 1 design. Each has a bench.|$|E
5|$|In 1760, {{one year}} after Voltaire {{published}} Candide, a sequel was published with the name Candide, ou l'optimisme, seconde partie. This work is attributed both to Thorel de Campigneulles, a writer unknown today, and Henri Joseph Du Laurens, who is suspected of having habitually plagiarised Voltaire. The story continues in this sequel with Candide having new adventures in the Ottoman Empire, Persia, and Denmark. Part II has potential use in studies of the popular and literary receptions of Candide, but is almost certainly apocryphal. In total, by the year 1803, at least ten <b>imitations</b> <b>of</b> Candide or continuations of its story were published by authors other than Voltaire.|$|E

50|$|By {{the end of}} the 9th century, the {{physical}} <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> Christ had grown in popularity among Christians and the 895 Council of Tribur considered triple immersion in Baptism as an <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> the three days of Jesus in the tomb, and the rising from the water as an <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> the Resurrection of Jesus. This period also witnessed a growing trend towards the denial of the flesh in favor of the soul among the monastic communities, who saw the rebuffing of {{the physical}} body (as an <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> the sufferings of Christ) as a path to a higher level of spiritual achievement.|$|R

5|$|Though Han wooden {{structures}} decayed, some Han-dynasty ruins made of brick, stone, and rammed earth remain intact. This includes stone pillar-gates, brick tomb chambers, rammed-earth city walls, rammed-earth and brick beacon towers, rammed-earth {{sections of the}} Great Wall, rammed-earth platforms where elevated halls once stood, and two rammed-earth castles in Gansu. The ruins of rammed-earth walls that once surrounded the capitals Chang'an and Luoyang still stand, along with their drainage systems of brick arches, ditches, and ceramic water pipes. Monumental stone pillar-gates, twenty-nine of which survive from the Han period, formed entrances of walled enclosures at shrine and tomb sites. These pillars feature artistic <b>imitations</b> <b>of</b> wooden and ceramic building components such as roof tiles, eaves, and balustrades.|$|E
5|$|A {{prototype}} for the Kinetoscope {{was shown to}} a convention of the National Federation of Women's Clubs on May 20, 1891. The first public demonstration of the Kinetoscope {{was held at the}} Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences on May 9, 1893. Instrumental to the birth of American movie culture, the Kinetoscope also had a major impact in Europe; its influence abroad was magnified by Edison's decision not to seek international patents on the device, facilitating numerous <b>imitations</b> <b>of</b> and improvements on the technology. In 1895, Edison introduced the Kinetophone, which joined the Kinetoscope with a cylinder phonograph. Film projection, which Edison initially disdained as financially nonviable, soon superseded the Kinetoscope's individual exhibition model. Many of the projection systems developed by Edison's firm in later years would use the Kinetoscope name.|$|E

5|$|Camouflage {{is found}} in many butterflies. Some like the oakleaf {{butterfly}} and autumn leaf are remarkable <b>imitations</b> <b>of</b> leaves. As caterpillars, many defend themselves by freezing and appearing like sticks or branches. Others have deimatic behaviours, such as rearing up and waving their front ends which are marked with eyespots {{as if they were}} snakes. Some papilionid caterpillars such as the giant swallowtail (Papilio cresphontes) resemble bird droppings. Some caterpillars have hairs and bristly structures that provide protection while others are gregarious and form dense aggregations. Some species are myrmecophiles, forming mutualistic associations with ants and gaining their protection. Behavioural defences include perching and angling the wings to reduce shadow and avoid being conspicuous. Some female Nymphalid butterflies guard their eggs from parasitoidal wasps.|$|E
5|$|In 849, Calakmul was {{mentioned}} at Seibal where a ruler named as Chan Pet attended the K'atun-ending ceremony; his name {{may also be}} recorded on a broken ceramic at Calakmul itself. However, {{it is unlikely that}} Calakmul still existed as a state in any meaningful way at this late date. A final flurry of activity took place {{at the end of the}} 9th century or the beginning of the 10th. A new stela was erected, although the date records only the day, not the full date. The recorded day may fall either in 899 or 909 with the latter date the most likely. A few monuments appear to be even later although their style is crude, representing the efforts of a remnant population to maintain the Classic Maya tradition. Even the inscriptions on these late monuments are meaningless <b>imitations</b> <b>of</b> writing.|$|E
5|$|Well-known poets of the Edwardian {{era of the}} 1890s, such as Alfred Austin, Stephen Phillips, and William Watson, {{had been}} working {{very much in the}} shadow of Tennyson, {{producing}} weak <b>imitations</b> <b>of</b> the poetry of the Victorian era. They continued to work in this vein into {{the early years of the}} 20th century. As the new century opened, Austin was still the serving British Poet Laureate, a post he held up to 1913. In the century's first decade, poetry still had a large audience; volumes of verse published in that time included Thomas Hardy's The Dynasts, Christina Rossetti's posthumous Poetical Works, Ernest Dowson's Poems, George Meredith's Last Poems, Robert Service's Ballads of a Cheechako and John Masefield's Ballads and Poems. Future Nobel Prize winner William Butler Yeats was devoting much of his energy to the Abbey Theatre and writing for the stage, producing relatively little lyric poetry during this period. In 1907, the Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to Rudyard Kipling.|$|E

The <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> Christ, as in Ephesians 5:1 is then viewed by Paul as a path to the <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> God: [...] "Be ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children, and walk in love, even as Christ also loved you".|$|R
5|$|Constantinople's {{cultural}} influence {{extended from}} Sicily to Russia. Armenia, as a border state between the Roman-Byzantine and Sasanian empires, {{was influenced by}} both. The exact relationship between Byzantine architecture {{and that of the}} Caucasus is unclear. Georgia and Armenia produced many central planned, domed buildings in the 7th century and, after a lull during the Arab invasions, the architecture flourished again in the Middle Byzantine Period. Armenian church domes were initially wooden structures. Etchmiadzin Cathedral (c. 483) originally had a wooden dome covered by a wooden pyramidal roof before this was replaced with stone construction in 618. Churches with stone domes became the standard type after the 7th century, perhaps benefiting from a possible exodus of stonecutters from Syria, but the long traditions of wooden construction carried over stylistically. Some examples in stone as late as the 12th century are detailed <b>imitations</b> <b>of</b> clearly wooden prototypes. Armenian church building was prolific in the late 6th and 7th centuries and, by the 7th century, the churches tend to be either central plans or combinations of central and longitudinal plans. Domes were supported by either squinches (which were used in the Sasanian Empire but rarely in the Byzantine) or pendentives like those of the Byzantine empire, and the combination of domed-cross plan with the hall-church plan could have been influenced by the architecture of Justinian. Domes and cross arms were added to the longitudinal cathedral of Dvin from 608 to 615 and a church in Tekor. Other domed examples include Ptghnavank in Ptghni (c. 600), a church in T'alinn (662-85), and the Cathedral of Mren (629-40).|$|E
