The measurement of residual stresses is very important in exacting dynamically loaded machine parts, which have been subjected to different kinds of heat treatment.

After that distribution of other relevant mechanical properties was predicted based on predicted as-quenched and tempered hardness of steel. Experimental investigation has been performed on low alloy steel. The established procedure for estimation of quenched and tempered properties of steel has been applied in computer simulation of mechanical properties of quenched and tempered steel workpiece of complex form. Findings: Algorithm of estimation of hardness of quenched and tempered steel was improved.

40|$|AbstractGrade 91 {{steel is}} a <b>heat</b> <b>treatable</b> <b>steel</b> and hence its {{microstructure}} is {{very sensitive to}} temperature. The weld joint consisting of a heterogeneous microstructure exhibits a lower fatigue life {{than that of the}} base metal. This is due to the presence of soft zone in the heat affected zone (HAZ). The failure location in the weld joint is very sensitive to the test parameters such as temperature and strain amplitude and application of hold. At high temperatures and under hold application, strain localization occurs in the soft intercritical HAZ (ICHAZ) which results in the failure in the HAZ. Sub- surface creep cavity formation in the soft region and their linkage cause enhanced crack propagation and that translates into lower fatigue life of the weld joint at high temperatures. Occurrence of compression dwell sensitivity in the material is attributed to the presence of surface oxides...|$|E

40|$|In {{implementation}} of innovative lightweight construction concepts in automotive engineering, {{the design of}} steel materials moved into {{the focus of the}} engineers which have high strength after forming. The requirements, producing sheet metal parts with complex geometry and high strength, combined with a minimum part weight, can be met by using an innovative forming process called press hardening. High-strength <b>heat</b> <b>treatable</b> <b>steels,</b> such as the 22 MnB 5, are suitable for use in this process and also for the subsequent use in automobiles. A process simulation for efficient optimization of forming processes requires precise material data in the temperature range of the used process. The possibilities to determine these material data are very limited and appropriate test facilities are cost-intensive. The aim is, to examine how it is possible to perform hot tensile tests under the process conditions of press hardening with a low cost extension of a mechanical universal testing machine. In the present work, initially a systematically elementary knowledge of hot forming of sheet metal and the determination of flow curves of sheet metal blanks is acquired. To extend the universal testing machine a heating unit is designed. The measurement of deformations and the sample temperature in the testing procedure is carried out with existing measurement systems. The usage of a thermografic camera enables a large-scale measurement on the sample surface and thus the analysis of the temperature distribution. With the knowledge gained, suitable sample geometries for the usage in conductively heated tensile test are identified. Elemental analysis methods are applied to these sample geometries for flow curve determination. This work shows that a low cost extension of a universal testing machine is feasible to realize tensile tests under the process conditions of press hardening. Finally, the conditions for an application of FEM for inverse simulation of conductively heated tensile test were tested. The simulation model created represents the sample heating and the subsequent tensile test as well. For this case, the basic conditions for a use of the FEM for inverse simulation are now given...|$|R
40|$|Hot {{cracking}} in welding {{is still}} an unresolved problem {{for a wide range}} of materials that restricts their use in production. Although free cutting steels are a prominent example of hot cracking sensitivity, other industrially important materials like high strength aluminium alloys, many austenitic steel grades and several high-temperature alloys are also prone to hot cracking. In all cases the actual forming of a hot crack is not only the consequence of metallurgical reasons but also of special thermomechanical conditions, namely too much tensile strain on the not fully solidified regions. Therefore it is not only possible to avoid the cracks by avoiding the mentioned metallurgical reasons, but also by reducing or counteracting any stress / strain on the hot-cracking critical zones. As the latter approach is much less discussed in the literature and only seldom pursued industrial application research, this article wants to emphasize its importance by introducing a new technique against hot cracks on this basis. A new process technique is presented which aims at reducing or avoiding hot cracking during laser welding. It is based on a tailored temperature field around the molten pool that changes the thermomechanical conditions of the material during the solidification of the weld. The required additional volumetric heat input is realized by inductive heating. The technique was tested successfully on strongly hot cracking sensitive <b>heat</b> <b>treatable</b> free cutting <b>steels.</b> The results of these tests show not only the relation between possible thermal and mechanical influences on the cracking intensity but also give important information about the possibilities and limits of the technique.

40|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that the initiation and development of adiabatic shear bands (ASBs) are manifestations of damage in metallic materials subjected to high strain rates and large strains as those due to impact in a Hopkinson Bar system. Models for evolution of these bands have been described in the literature. One question that has not received attention is how persistent these bands are and whether their presence and effect can be reversed or eliminated by using a process of thermal (heat treatment) or thermo-mechanical treatment that would relieve the material from the high strain associated with ASBs and their role as precursors to crack initiation and subsequent failure. Since ASBs are more prevalent and more defined in BCC metals including steels, a {{study was conducted to}} investigate the best conditions of generating ASBs in a <b>heat</b> <b>treatable</b> <b>steel,</b> followed by determining the best conditions for heat treatment of specimens already damaged by the presence of ASBs in order to relieve the strains due to ASBs and restore the material to an apparent microstructure without the “scars” due to the previous presence of ASBs.

40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is {{investigation}} of dynamic impacts on cutting edge during machining of locally hardened steel. Alteration of hardness on a single work piece is a source of impact on tool, which could lead to breakage of cutting tool and work piece surface damage in turning. Influence of material properties (primary hardness) is important when work piece is hardened locally by induction and part of material is soft annealed. Design/methodology/approach: Experimental tests of cutting outputs have been done on specimens after induction hardening to evaluate the rate of variation of cutting forces, surface roughness and chip formation because of hardness alteration. Measured data of main cutting force were analyzed in frequency and time domain. Findings: It was found that chip formation condition, chip thickness and chip shape depends on cutting forces alteration in transition areas in the range of 10 to 15 %. Much higher alteration of force signal is recorded when machining is performed with low depth of cutting value as a result of backlash in system. The most important value of cutting force correlates with depth of cutting, and roughness correlates oppositely to the hardness. Research limitations/implications: Results and findings presented in this paper are qualitative and might be slightly different in other cutting condition (e. g. other heat treatable steels or other hardening techniques or other single cutting point processes). There is evident force value alteration in the transition (hard to soft state) zone.
