We propose that these dislocations are topological defects in the phase of the complex order-parameter which describes the dynamic zero-point atomic correlations, unique to the bcc phase. These is a shear strain field associated with these topological defects. We show that the smallest topological defect is a localized excitation, a loop-defect, which leads to the exponential growth of the <b>dislocation</b> <b>lines</b> with temperature.

Considerably higher dislocation density was obtained for the < 111 [*]>[*]orientation, indicating more plastic deformation and much lower flow stress in the material, when compared to that for < 001 [*]>[*]orientation. <b>Dislocation</b> <b>lines</b> looped around the precipitate, and most dislocations were deposited {{on the surface of}} precipitate, forming a network of <b>dislocation</b> <b>lines.</b> Simple unloading resulted in a reduction of dislocation density.|$|R
50|$|The screw {{dislocation}} {{is more difficult}} to visualise, but basically comprises a structure in which a helical path is traced around the linear defect (<b>dislocation</b> <b>line)</b> by the atomic planes of atoms in the crystal lattice.|$|E
50|$|Another way {{in which}} new {{dislocation}}s can form are so called Frank-Read sources. These form when a dislocation is stopped at two places. The part of the dislocation in between will move along, causing the <b>dislocation</b> <b>line</b> to curve. This curving can continue until the dislocation curves over itself to form a circle. In the centre of such a circle the source will produce a new dislocation, and this process will produce a sequence of dislocations {{on top of each}} other. Frank-Read sources are also created when screw dislocations double cross-slip (change slip planes twice), as the jogs in the <b>dislocation</b> <b>line</b> pin the dislocation in the 3rd plane.|$|E

50|$|Dislocations {{can slip}} in planes {{containing}} both the <b>dislocation</b> <b>line</b> and the Burgers vector. For a screw dislocation, the <b>dislocation</b> <b>line</b> and the Burgers vector are parallel, so the dislocation may slip in any plane containing the dislocation. For an edge dislocation, the dislocation and the Burgers vector are perpendicular, {{so there is}} only one plane in which the dislocation can slip. There is an alternative mechanism of dislocation motion, fundamentally different from slip, that allows an edge dislocation to move out of its slip plane, known as dislocation climb. Dislocation climb allows an edge dislocation to move perpendicular to its slip plane. A creep mechanism involving only dislocation climb, also known as Harper-Dorn creep, can occur under certain conditions.|$|E
50|$|When a <b>dislocation</b> <b>line</b> intersects {{the surface}} of a {{metallic}} material, the associated strain field locally increases the relative susceptibility of the material to acidic etching and an etch pit of regular geometrical format results. If the material is strained (deformed) and repeatedly re-etched, a series of etch pits can be produced which effectively trace the movement of the dislocation in question.|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} of dislocation results in lattice strain (distortion). The direction {{and magnitude of}} such distortion is {{expressed in terms of}} a Burgers vector (b). For an edge type, b is perpendicular to the <b>dislocation</b> <b>line,</b> whereas in the cases of the screw type it is parallel. In metallic materials, b is aligned with close-packed crystallographic directions and its magnitude is equivalent to one interatomic spacing.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the homogenization of a non-local first order Hamilton-Jacobi equation describing the dynamics of several <b>dislocation</b> <b>lines</b> and the homogenization of some particle systems with twobody interactions. The first objective is to establish a connection between the rescaled dynamics of a increasing number of <b>dislocation</b> <b>lines</b> and the <b>dislocation</b> dynamics density, passing from a discrete model (<b>dislocation</b> <b>lines)</b> to a continuous one (dislocation density). A first answer to this problem was presented in a paper by Rouy and the two last authors [18] but the geometric definition of the fronts was not completely satisfactory. This problem is completely solved here. The limit equation is a nonlinear diffusion equation involving a first order Lévy operator. This integral operator keeps memory of the long range interactions, while the nonlinearity keeps memory of short ones. The techniques and tools we introduce {{turn out to be the}} right ones to get homogenization results for the dynamics of particles in two-body interaction. The systems of ODEs we consider are very close to overdamped Frenkel-Kontorova models. We prove that the rescaled “cumulative distribution function” of the particles converges towards the continuous solution of a nonlinear diffusion equation...|$|R
50|$|By {{moving a}} {{dislocation}} {{step by step}} through a crystal lattice a linear lattice defect is created between parts of the crystal lattice, which is called a dislocation. Two types of dislocations exist. Edge dislocations form {{the edge of an}} extra layer of atoms inside the crystal lattice.

5000|$|The primary species {{responsible}} for work hardening are dislocations. Dislocations {{interact with each}} other by generating stress fields in the material. The interaction between the stress fields of dislocations can impede dislocation motion by repulsive or attractive interactions. Additionally, if two dislocations cross, <b>dislocation</b> <b>line</b> entanglement occurs, causing the formation of a jog which opposes dislocation motion. These entanglements and jogs act as pinning points, which oppose dislocation motion. As both of these processes are more likely to occur when more dislocations are present, there is a correlation between dislocation density and yield strength, ...|$|E
5000|$|Consider a {{straight}} dislocation in a crystal slip plane with its two ends, A and B, pinned. If a shear stress [...] is exerted on the slip plane then a force , where b is the Burgers vector of the dislocation and x is {{the distance between}} the pinning sites A and B, is exerted on the <b>dislocation</b> <b>line</b> {{as a result of the}} shear stress. This force acts perpendicularly to the line, inducing the dislocation to lengthen and curve into an arc. The bending force caused by the shear stress is opposed by the line tension of the dislocation, which acts on each end of the dislocation along the direction of the <b>dislocation</b> <b>line</b> away from A and B with a magnitude of , where G is the shear modulus. If the dislocation bends, the ends of the dislocation make an angle with the horizontal between A and B, which gives the line tensions acting along the ends a vertical component acting directly against the force induced by the shear stress. If sufficient shear stress is applied and the dislocation bends, the vertical component from the line tensions, which acts directly against the force caused by the shear stress, grows as the dislocation approaches a semicircular shape. When the dislocation becomes a semicircle, all of the line tension is acting against the bending force induced by the shear stress, because the line tension is perpendicular to the horizontal between A and B. For the dislocation to reach this point, it is thus evident that the equation: ...|$|E
40|$|The {{interpretation}} of the Bordoni relaxation and of related relaxation phenomena {{in terms of the}} thermally activated, stress-assisted formation of kink pairs on <b>dislocation</b> <b>lines</b> is well established on assuming that the migration of kinks along <b>dislocation</b> <b>lines</b> is described by a high kink mobility µk. This assumption, however, is not valid if the activation enthalpy for kink migration, Hm, is comparable with or even larger than the formation enthalpy of kink pairs or if even when small compared with the formation energy of kinks, Hm is larger than the lowest thermal energies accessible in internal friction experiments. In those cases not only migration but also annihilation and trapping of thermal kink pairs may produce internal friction peaks. The difference-differential equations governing the thermal kink pairs evolution along <b>dislocation</b> <b>lines</b> under the action of a homogeneous applied shear stress are set up and their time-dependent solutions characterized by a set of relaxation times.

Some consequences are proposed, like : a) the nucleation of edge <b>dislocation</b> <b>lines</b> in the so-called undulation instability, and b) the easy crossing without pinning of edge and screw <b>dislocation</b> <b>lines.</b> The analysis stays entirely in the limit of linear elasticity, and it is proposed that interesting non-linear phenomena should appear for high strain values...|$|R
