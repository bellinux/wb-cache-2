40|$|Z Cam {{variables}} are a subclass of dwarf nova that lie near a global bifurcation between outbursting ("limit cycle") and non-outbursting ("standstill") states. It {{is believed that}} variations in the secondary star's mass-injection rate instigate transitions between the two regimes. In this paper we explore an alternative trigger for these transitions: stochastic fluctuations in the disk's turbulent viscosity. We employ simple one-zone and global viscous models which, though inappropriate for detailed matching to observed light curves, clearly indicate that turbulent disk fluctuations <b>induce</b> <b>outbursts</b> when the system is sufficiently close to the global bifurcation point. While the models easily produce the observed "outburst dip" pairs exhibited by Z Cam and Nova-like variables, they struggle to generate long trains of outbursts. We conclude that mass transfer variability is the dominant physical process determining the overall Z Cam standstill outburst pattern, but that viscous stochasticity provides an additional ingredient explaining some of the secondary features observed.

40|$|Abstract. Coal-gas {{outburst}} {{is a kind}} {{of complex}} disaster induced by engineer operations in the process of extracting or developing in coal seams. According to the theories of gas seepage and deformation of coal or rock seams, taking consideration of the heterogeneity property of coal or rock materials in mechanics of materials as well as non-linear permeability characteristic of coal or rock materials in the process of deformation and fracture, SPH algorithm of LS-DYNA software is used to numerically simulate the coal-gas <b>outburst</b> <b>induced</b> by development in coal seams. Simulation results represent the whole process of coal-gas outburst from the growing, extending and connecting of cracks to final outburst under the impact of gas pressure, ground stress and mechanical properties of coal-rock. The nonlinear nature of the mutation of <b>outburst</b> <b>induced</b> by gradual destruction of the coal or rock materials under the influence of developing operations is revealed, including the evolution of the stress field in the rupture process of the coal or rock material. This provides a theoretical foundation for further understanding the mechanism of coal-gas outburst as well as preventing outburst technology...|$|R

40|$|At {{the end of}} March 2012 a {{prominent}} optical outburst was observed in the binary black hole system OJ 287. It does not fit the expected sequence of outbursts from the primary component and the bremsstrahlung outbursts from the accretion disk impacts of the secondary component. These occur in a well established pattern repeated with an approximately 12 year interval. In this work we discuss {{the possibility that the}} outburst originates from the secondary black hole. The timing of the 2012 outburst relative to the expected sequence would make it a counterpart of the precursor outbursts in 1993 and 2004, which occured before the main pattern of outbursts. If so, it appears that a precursor occurs when the secondary reaches a constant level above the mean accretion disk level of the primary component. It may be that this encounter <b>induces</b> an <b>outburst</b> in the secondary which is nearly as prominent as the outbursts in the expected sequence. The strength of these outbursts depends strongly on the spin of the secondary.

40|$|Fragmentation and fission {{of giant}} {{molecular}} clouds occasionally {{results in a}} pair of gravitationally bound star clusters that orbit their mutual centre of mass for some time, under the influence of internal and external perturbations. We investigate the evolution of binary star clusters with different orbital configurations, with a particular focus on the Galactic tidal field. We carry out N-body simulations of evolving binary star clusters and compare our results with estimates from our semi-analytic model. The latter accounts for mass loss due to stellar evolution and two-body relaxation, and for evolution due to external tides. Using the semi-analytic model we predict the long-term evolution {{for a wide range of}} initial conditions. It accurately describes the global evolution of such systems, until the moment when a cluster merger is imminent. N-body simulations are used to test our semi-analytic model and also to study additional features of evolving binary clusters, such as the kinematics of stars, global cluster rotation, evaporation rates, and the cluster merger process. We find that the initial orientation of a binary star cluster with respect to the Galactic field, and also the initial orbital phase, are crucial for its fate. Depending on these properties, the binaries may experience orbital reversal, spiral-in, or vertical oscillation about the Galactic plane before they actually merge at t≈ 100 Myr, and produce rotating star clusters with slightly higher evaporation rates. The merger process of a binary cluster <b>induces</b> an <b>outburst</b> that ejects ∼ 10 % of the stellar members into the Galactic field.

5000|$|At first, Kammerer {{does not}} take his {{situation}} seriously. He imagines himself a Robinson Crusoe stranded on an island inhabited by primitive but friendly natives. He {{is looking forward to}} establishing contact and befriending the population of the planet. However, the reality turns out to be far from glamorous. Kammerer finds himself in the capital of a totalitarian state, perpetually at war with its neighbors. The population is governed by an anonymous oligarchy of Unknown Fathers, with police and military omnipresent. The city is grim and polluted. The ordinary populace leads the life of privation and misery. What goes on around Kammerer does not make sense to him, since his own society is free from war, crime and material shortages. [...] Eventually, it is revealed that to maintain the loyalty of the population, the Fathers employ mind control broadcasts. The broadcast towers pepper the landscape of the country. The mind-altering capabilities of the towers are kept secret, they are disguised as ballistic missile defense installations. Constant broadcasts suppress the ability to evaluate information critically, hence making the omnipresent regime propaganda much more effective. In addition, twice a day, intense broadcasts relieve mental stress caused by the disconnect between the propaganda and the observed reality by <b>inducing</b> an <b>outburst</b> of blinding enthusiasm. The authors give a masterful description of this process at work, describing the thoughts of one of the characters as he switches from the state of peeved boredom and disdain for his superiors to the rapturous adoration of people around him and life in general.|$|R
40|$|Accretion-driven {{luminosity}} outbursts are a vivid {{manifestation of}} variable mass accretion onto protostars. They {{are known as}} the so-called FU Orionis phenomenon {{in the context of}} low-mass protostars. More recently, this process has been found in models of primordial star formation. Using numerical radiation hydrodynamics simulations, we stress that present-day forming massive stars also experience variable accretion and show that this process is accompanied by luminous <b>outbursts</b> <b>induced</b> by the episodic accretion of gaseous clumps falling from the circumstellar disk onto the protostar. Consequently, the process of accretion-induced luminous flares is also conceivable in the high-mass regime of star formation and we propose to regard this phenomenon as a general mechanism that can affect protostars regardless of their mass and/or the chemical properties of the parent environment in which they form. In addition to the commonness of accretion-driven outbursts in the star formation machinery, we conjecture that luminous flares from regions hosting forming high-mass star may be an observational implication of the fragmentation of their accretion disks.

40|$|Assimilation of {{meteorological}} observations is formulated as a constrained {{nonlinear programming}} problem. The gradient method iterates {{search for the}} minimum point. Each iteration requires the gradient of the objective function with respect to its variables. This paper develops a method for gradient computation. A model equation for the atmospheric flow is considered. From a given initial condition, the model equation is integrated by marching outward from the initial condition, and the correspnding solution is obtained. A finite differece scheme is employed. An objective function is defined; it measures {{the distance between the}} solution of the model equation and the observations available. For a given initial condition and for the corresponding solution of the model equation, the objective function is evaluated. Thus, the objective function is regarded as a function of an initial condition. The gradient method is used {{in order to determine the}} initial condition which minimizes the objective function. If the initial condition is perturbed, the solution of the model equation is also perturbed. From the discretized model equations, the equation is derived for the perturbations. On the other hand, the objective function is discretized. If the initial condition is perturbed, the discretised objective function is aloso perturbed. From the perturbation equation and the perturbed objective function, the algorithm for gradient computation is dereived. The algorithm integrates the adjoint equation. A numerical experiment is presented for a three-dimensional downburst. A downburst is a strong downdraft which <b>induces</b> an <b>outburst</b> of damaging winds on or near the ground. A downburst is initiated by placing a distribution of rainwater, and is simulated by integrating the model equation. Out of the simulation result, the $x$ component of the wind velocity and the rainwater are assumed to be the observations from a Doppler radar. For an initial guess of the initial condition, the gradient of the objective function is computed, and is compared with one computed by the finite difference method. The two gradients agree reasonably. The present method reduces CPU time by a factor of about 100 compared with the finite difference method...|$|R
40|$|Generally Early Triassic floras are {{believed}} to be depauperate, suffering from protracted recovery following the Permian–Triassic extinction event. Here we present palynological data of an expanded East Greenland section documenting recovered floras in the basal Triassic (Griesbachian) and a subsequent fundamental floral turnover, postdating the Permian–Triassic boundary extinction by about 500 kyrs. This event is marked by a swap in dominating floral elements, changing from gymnosperm pollen-dominated associations in the Griesbachian to lycopsid spore-dominated assemblages in the Dienerian. This turnover coincides with an extreme δ 13 Corg negative shift revealing a severe environmental crisis, probably <b>induced</b> by volcanic <b>outbursts</b> of the Siberian Traps, accompanied by a climatic turnover, changing from cool and dry in the Griesbachian to hot and humid in the Dienerian. Estimates of sedimentation rates suggest that this environmental alteration took place within some 1000 years. Similar, coeval changes documented on the North Indian Margin (Pakistan) and theBowen Basin (Australia) indicate the global extent of this crisis. Our results evidence the first profound disruption of the recovery of terrestrial environments about 500 kyrs after the Permian–Triassic extinction event. It was followed by another crisis, about 1 myrs later thus, the Early Triassic can be characterised as a time of successive environmental crises...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{variations of}} the mass transfer rate in cataclysmic variables (CVs) that are <b>induced</b> by nova <b>outbursts.</b> The ejection of nova shells leads to a spread of transfer rates in systems with similar orbital period. The effect is maximal if the specific angular momentum in the shell {{is the same as}} the specific orbital angular momentum of the white dwarf. We show analytically that in this case the nova-induced widening of the mass transfer rate distribution can be significant if the system, in the absence of nova outbursts, is close to mass transfer instability (i. e., within a factor of ~ 1. 5 of the critical mass ratio). Hence the effect is negligible below the period gap and for systems with high-mass white dwarfs. At orbital periods between about 3 and 6 hrs the width of the mass transfer rate distribution exceeds an order of magnitude if the mass accreted on the white dwarf prior to the runaway is larger than a few 10 ^{- 4 } M_sun. At a given orbital period in this range, systems with the highest transfer rate should on average have the largest ratio of donor to white dwarf mass. We show results of population synthesis models which confirm and augment the analytic results. Comment: ApJ, in press; 14 pages (incl. 7 figures), emulateapj styl...|$|R
40|$|The Muncie esker, a {{glaciofluvial}} ridged system, {{consists of}} three sharp-crested esker segments in the proximal and central sections, and a broad=crested, fan shaped distal segment. Grain size ranged from clay to boulders, although a larger presence of coarser material with high standard deviation values occurs in the proximal and central segments, while higher concentrations of finer sediment, primarily sand, exists in the distal segment. Field mapping and description included its geomorphic expression, stratigraphic relationships that consisted of facies identification, sedimentary structure, and paleocurrent direction. Sedimentological parameters, including downesker trends in grain size, sorting, a fractal analysis of grain size persistence, and clast roundness, was also investigated. The interpretation of the results provided us with detailed information allowing us to formulate a specific model of esker genesis. The depositional model consists primarily of nearly continuous, contemporaneous subglacial deposition that reulted {{in the formation of}} the proximal and central esker segments, and time-transgressive sedimentation, containing interlayered and randomly distributed ice rafted debris, in the form of a subaqueous delta that prograded beyond the ice-margin, forming the distal esker segment. Early stage deposition consisted of bed load transport from moderate flow velocities within a preglacial bedrock valley that served as an R-channel for preliminary subglacial meltwater drainage. Intermediate stage formation consisted of subglacial sedimentation from a hyperconcentrated deforming bed, <b>induced</b> by an <b>outburst</b> flood, and distal deltaic sedimentation as the subglacial flood discharged beyond the ice margin into an ice-marginal lake. Late stage deposition arises from bed load sedimentation of moderate fluvial activity reworking the upper portions of the hyperconcentrated flow deposits and upper deltaic facies. The finality of esker formation concluded with the ablation of the subglacial tunnel roof, sending a supraglacial debris flow that conformably covers the proximal and central esker segments in the form of a diamicton drape.
