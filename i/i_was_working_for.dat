2500|$|... “About {{this time}} the whole Carlisle School made a visit to Philadelphia. [...] A meeting was held in a large hall, and Captain Pratt spoke {{of the work of}} the school, and how all the Indian boys and girls were doing. [...] Then John Wanamaker had me come up on the stage. [...] He told the {{audience}} that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> him and that I was a Carlisle boy. [...] He stated that I had been promoted from one department to another, every month getting better work and better money, and {{in spite of the fact}} that he employed as many as one thousand people in his establishment, he never promoted anyone as rapidly as he had me. [...] That brought considerable applause, and Captain Pratt was very proud of me.|$|E
2500|$|Parks {{first became}} acquainted with Brian Wilson {{sometime}} in mid-1965, when David Crosby invited Parks to Wilson's home {{to hear a}} four-track dub of the Beach Boys' forthcoming [...] "Sloop John B" [...] single. In February 1966, both Parks and Wilson reconnected at a lawn party thrown by Terry Melcher. In Wilson's mostly ghostwritten 1993 autobiography, {{it was said that}} his first impressions of Parks was [...] "a skinny kid with a unique perspective" [...] and that he [...] "had a fondness for amphetamines" [...] at the time. Parks hesitantly confirmed this, but added, [...] "Those were his amphetamines. They were in his medicine cabinet. I'd never had amphetamines. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> Brian Wilson at 3:30 AM when he wanted to have his amphetamines." [...] It was also Parks who introduced Wilson to Beatles publicist Derek Taylor, who later became the Beach Boys' publicist for some time during the 1960s.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just so." [...] The lines {{showed more}} sharply on Jacob Welse's forehead. [...] "You <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> your own stomach. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> the stomachs of twenty thousand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. Officially, I {{have nothing}} to do with it. Until I have found that last link in my chain, I must remain behind the scenes. Mrs. Cavendish must think <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> her husband, not against him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> the Penn. {{for seven}} years now. Now I've got a {{vacation}} of three months. On me. Gives {{me a chance to}} travel a little. Got ten plunks and a second-class ticket back from Glasgow. But I'm going to see England and France just the same. Prob'ly Germany, too." ...|$|R
2500|$|Gooch's {{commitment}} to England cricket and {{passion for the}} game remains. When commenting on the new England coaching role he said: [...] "It {{came out of the}} blue. I met Andy at Trent Bridge when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> radio and I was a bit surprised when he asked me to do it. But you spend your career trying to do your bit for England and when you're asked to help again the call of your country is special.". He has since remained as England's batting coach on a permanent basis, continuing this role for the 2010 series against Bangladesh and Pakistan, and the winter Ashes series against Australia in Australia. Double-centurion Alastair Cook (at the first test at the Gabba in Brisbane) hailed Gooch's influence on England's and his own batting prowess. Gooch subsequently has supervised England's batting (or 'run-scoring', as Ian Bell has noted Gooch refers to it) throughout their rise to number 1 in the Test cricket ICC Rankings. Prior to Gooch taking over, English batsmen had scored 6 test double-centuries in 15 years. 15 months after he became the batting coach, England had already beaten that total.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{are very}} far from being that, sir," [...] the man answered. [...] "A few years ago <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> the Government--and you were not often out of my sight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{friend is}} not a poor man," [...] Mr. Gaynsforth admitted. [...] "You see, there's a sort of feeling abroad that these two things <b>are</b> connected. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not <b>working</b> {{on behalf of the}} police. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not <b>working</b> on behalf of any one who desires the least publicity. But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> some one who wants to know and is {{prepared}} to pay." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have brought}} Venetia her toys,' said Captain Cadurcis, 'and {{she was right}} to defend me, as <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "From one of Germany's chief {{friends in}} England. He is {{high up in}} the {{diplomatic}} service of--of a neutral country, but he has <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> Germany ever since the commencement of the war. He has been helping in this. He has seen me often with Nicholas Fenn, and he believes that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> behind the scenes, too. He believes that I know the truth, and that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> Germany. He <b>is</b> absolutely to be relied upon. Every word that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> telling you is the truth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And then {{he asks me}} who <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>for,</b> and I {{shows him}} Rancho Chiquito, two miles away, {{in the shadow of}} a low hill, and he tells me he's a deputy sheriff.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{knew him}} very well," [...] {{answered}} Walkirk. [...] "Those were his prints I was cataloguing just before I entered your service. He had then been dead {{a year or}} more, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> the estate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My talisman!" [...] he said. [...] "It {{has been}} my talisman of success many a time. I have laid my hand on it, and thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> you. Mine! mine! mine! Waters cannot quench love--never fear." ...|$|E

30|$|When I {{found out}} he <b>was</b> gambling, oh <b>I</b> <b>was</b> gutted, devastated, because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>working,</b> supposedly, <b>for</b> us to get ahead in life. … Just the lies, and the betrayal, and the broken {{promises}} (Barbara).|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose <b>I</b> <b>was</b> wrong," [...] Graham muttered, [...] "but <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> {{about ten}} hours on end, and then rushed up to London {{in the car}} to try and keep my {{appointment}} with Holderness." ...|$|R
6000|$|This {{the culprit}} admitted. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> Sam Gregg, and when Joe {{asked me to}} go show him the trail, I didn't expect to get cinched for killing game. I didn't fire a shot--now that's the God's truth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Vicar {{comes when}} he has time, and gives a lecture on an Epistle," [...] said Agatha, [...] "or a curate, if he doesn't; but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> the exam., and didn't go this last term. What was it, Polly?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh you haven't {{seen them}} ashore! At Utica {{they were very}} lively. But that's no longer our natural home. Don't you {{remember}} I told you <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> New York? Well, I worked--l had to work hard. But we've moved." ...|$|E
5000|$|How {{long have}} you <b>been</b> <b>working</b> here? — <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>working</b> here <b>for</b> three years ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you?" [...] said Frank. [...] "If {{you think}} that I fancy myself a better man than the Yankee, you mistake me: {{but at least you}} will confess that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not <b>working</b> <b>for</b> money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Conrad, if {{we cannot}} find this fellow before Ben Soloman comes, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{with you in}} the business. <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> him on {{starvation}} pay for the last three years, and hate him as much as you can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if you believed, not {{guessing}} all {{the while}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> the safety of my people, soon shall you be undeceived, since to-morrow night I invite you to the great ceremony of my nuptials, when, according to the ancient custom, I break the glass with him whom on the following night I take to be my husband," [...] and rising, she bowed thrice to the audience, then stretched out her hand to Joshua.|$|E
60|$|I {{was there}}, as I have mentioned, at all hours. When I {{was there at}} night, I {{generally}} went home with Charley in a coach; sometimes my guardian would meet me in the neighbourhood, and we would walk home together. One evening he had arranged to meet me at eight o'clock. I could not leave, as I usually did, quite punctually at the time, for <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> my dear girl and had a few stitches more to do to finish what I was about; but it was {{within a few minutes}} of the hour when I bundled up my little work-basket, gave my darling my last kiss for the night, and hurried downstairs. Mr. Woodcourt went with me, as it was dusk.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} what once {{happened}} to me. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> a blamed hard boss, and it doesn't matter why I quit without getting my wages out of him, but he wasn't feeling good when I lit out behind a freight-car. By bad luck, there was a trooper handy when a train-hand found me at a lonely side-track. Well, that policeman didn't {{know what to do}} with me. It was quite a way to the nearest guard-room; they don't get medals for corraling a man who's only stolen a ride, and he had to watch out for some cattle rustlers; so wherever he went I had to go along with him. We got quite friendly, and one night he said to me, 'There's a freight that stops here nearly due. I'll go to sleep while you get out on her.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|When Gloria Swanson and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> Sennett, {{it would}} take {{sometimes}} {{two or three months}} to make a two-reeler. We'd rehearse for a week or so before we'd crank a camera. But the weather {{had something to do with}} it, too. You see, photography in those days wasn't what it is now and most of our scenes were exteriors. Cheaper, you know. Didn't have to build sets. If we had a call for the next day and we woke up to find it cloudy or raining, we'd just go back to bed again. And it sure can rain out here during the wet season.|$|R
50|$|During World War <b>I,</b> Shippey <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> the YMCA in Paris, France. At {{the same}} time, {{he was writing}} for various American {{newspapers}} as a correspondent. Shippey told two versions of how he became acquainted with Madeleine Babin, the French woman for whom he eventually left his wife.|$|R
5000|$|On September 27, 2016, Montreal {{passed a}} citywide pit bull ban. Coderre {{was a big}} {{advocate}} for the bylaw stating that [...] "My duty as mayor of Montreal <b>is</b> making sure <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> all Montrealers, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> there {{to make sure they}} feel safe and that they are safe." [...] The bylaw creates a citywide ban on new pit bull-type dogs from being owned and restrictions on those currently in the city. The bylaw also places new restrictions on all dogs and cats within the city and its 19 boroughs, which has led to a lot of controversy. Animal protection groups such as the Montreal SPCA (Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) stated that if the new bylaw passes they will take legal action against the city.|$|R
6000|$|My {{correspondent}} {{also says}} that the habit of dining out in restaurants, etc., is growing. So, I believe, is the habit of committing suicide. I do not desire to connect the two facts together. It seems fairly clear that a man could not dine at a restaurant because he had just committed suicide; {{and it would be}} extreme, perhaps, to suggest that he commits suicide because he has just dined at a restaurant. But the two cases, when put side by side, are enough to indicate the falsity and poltroonery of this eternal modern argument from what is in fashion. The question for brave men is not whether a certain thing is increasing; the question is whether we are increasing it. I dine very often in restaurants because the nature of my trade makes it convenient: but if I thought that by dining in restaurants <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> the creation of communal meals, I would never enter a restaurant again; I would carry bread and cheese in my pocket or eat chocolate out of automatic machines. For the personal element in some things is sacred. I heard Mr. Will Crooks put it perfectly the other day: [...] "The most sacred thing {{is to be able to}} shut your own door." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ''Twadn't {{particular}} noticeable, for she wasn't a talkin' woman {{any time}} o' her days. Mary had all three's tongue.... Well, then, two years this summer, come what I'm tellin' you. Mary's Lunnon father, which they'd put clean out o' their minds, arrived down from Lunnon {{with the law}} on his side, sayin' he'd take his daughter back to Lunnon, after all. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> Mus' Dockett at Pounds Farm that summer, but I was obligin' Jim that evenin' muckin' out his pig-pen. I seed a stranger come traipsin' over the bridge agin' Wickenden's door-stones. 'Twadn't the new County Council bridge with the handrail. They hadn't given it in for a public right o' way then. 'Twas just a bit o' lathy old plank which Jim had throwed acrost the brook for his own conveniences. The man wasn't drunk--only a little concerned in liquor, like--an' his back was a mask where he'd slipped in the muck comin' along. He went up the bricks past Jim's mother, which was feedin' the ducks, an' set himself {{down at the table}} inside--Jim was just changin' his socks--an' the man let Jim know all his rights and aims regardin' Mary. Then there just about was a hurly-bulloo? Jim's fust mind was to pitch him forth, but he'd done that once in his young days, and got six months up to Lewes jail along o' the man fallin' on his head. So he swallowed his spittle an' let him talk. The law about Mary was on the man's side from fust to last, for he showed us all the papers. Then Mary come downstairs--she'd been studyin' for an examination--an' the man tells her who he was, an' she says he had ought to have took proper care of his own flesh and blood while he had it by him, an' not to think he could ree-claim it when it suited. He says somethin' or other, but she looks him up an' down, front an' backwent, an' she just tongues him scadderin' out o' doors, and he went away stuffin' all the papers back into his hat, talkin' most abusefully. Then she come back an' freed her mind against Jim an' his mother for not havin' warned her of her upbringin's, which it come out she hadn't ever been told. They didn't say naun to her. They never did. I'd ha' packed her off with any man that would ha' took her--an' God's pity on him!' ...|$|E

5000|$|In Bahrain's 2006 {{parliamentary}} election, some {{candidates have}} specifically {{sought out the}} Jewish vote; writer Munira Fakhro, Vice President of the Leftist National Democratic Action, standing in Isa Town told the local press: [...] "There are 20- 30 Jews in my area and <b>I</b> would <b>be</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> their benefit and raise their standard of living." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{perfect and}} {{progressive}} (continuous) aspects can be combined, usually in {{referring to the}} completed portion of a continuing action or temporary state: <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> eight hours. Here a form of the verb have (denoting the perfect) is used together with been (the past participle of be, denoting the progressive) and the present participle of the main verb.|$|R
6000|$|For {{some weeks}} now <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> elaborating my play in London where alone I {{can find the}} help I need, Mr. Dulac's mastery of design and Mr. Ito's genius of movement; yet it pleases {{me to think that}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> my own country. Perhaps some day a play in the form <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{adapting}} for European purposes shall awake once more, whether in Gaelic or in English, under the slope of Slieve-na-mon or Croagh Patrick ancient memories; for this form has no need of scenery that runs away with money nor of a theatre-building. Yet I know that I only amuse myself with a fancy; for though my writings if they be sea-worthy must put to sea, I cannot tell where they may be carried by the wind. Are not the fairy-stories of Oscar Wilde, which were written for Mr. Ricketts and Mr. Shannon and for a few ladies, very popular in Arabia? ...|$|R
