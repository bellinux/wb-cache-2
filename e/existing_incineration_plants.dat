This paper provides a comprehensive overview of <b>existing</b> MSW <b>incineration</b> <b>plants</b> and their capacities within Europe. In combination with the analysis of imports and exports of MSW for incineration, it provides an indication of over- and undercapacities for <b>incineration</b> <b>plants.</b> Among other things, the results show that in six of the 32 countries analysed in this study, capacities exceed more than 50 % of the annual waste generation, while in two countries the total amount of waste generated annually is not enough to fill all the <b>incineration</b> <b>plants...</b>|$|R
40|$|Excessive algae growth/ bloom {{has become}} a {{commonly}} observed phenomenon in many water bodies globally due to eutrophication. This phenomenon has also been observed in the Baltic Sea which create nuisance in many Baltic coastal communities when the macro algae of different species is washed ashore by wind and wave, which is known as “beach cast algae”. In recent years various Baltic projects have been commenced in order to utilize “beach cast algae” for energy production via anaerobic digestion technology. Harvesting beach cast macro algae for energy production not only give a renewable energy but also improve tourism and recreation, as well as largely contribute towards the marine ecosystem by reducing nutrient load. However, high concentration of heavy metal especially of cadmium in macro algae has limited the potential of anaerobic digestion since cadmium would limit the bio-fertilizer potential of the fermentation residue/digestate. Different heavy metal removal technique has been suggested so far but their potential on large scale application {{as well as the}} economic and environmental aspects of the removal techniques are unknown. The present thesis focuses on the west coast of Sweden and evaluate the possibility of combustion of beach cast macro algae in an already <b>existing</b> waste <b>incineration</b> <b>plant.</b> Furthermore, three different scenarios for energy extraction from beach cast macro algae are compared from an energy balance perspective. The study was based on a case study, literature review and energy balance analysis. The result showed combustion of both raw and digested macro algae in an already <b>existing</b> waste <b>incineration</b> <b>plant</b> would give a solution for coastal algae problem regardless of high cadmium content, moisture and ash content of macro algae. Energy extraction via combustion of raw as well as digested macro algae gave a positive energy balance. Anaerobic digestion of macro algae for instance with sewage sludge followed by combustion of the fermentation residue would give more benefit from energy point of view and could be used for cases of beach cast macro algae with high concentration of cadmium...|$|R

40|$|At {{international}} level LCA is being increasingly used to objectively evaluate {{the performances of}} different Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) management solutions. One {{of the more important}} waste management options concerns MSW incineration. LCA is usually applied to <b>existing</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plants.</b> In this study LCA methodology was applied to a new Italian incineration line, to facilitate the prediction, during the design phase, of its potential environmental impacts in terms of damage to human health, ecosystem quality and consumption of resources. The aim {{of the study was to}} analyse three different design alternatives: an incineration system with dry flue gas cleaning (without- and with-energy recovery) and one with wet flue gas cleaning. The last two technological solutions both incorporating facilities for energy recovery were compared. From the results of the study, the system with energy recovery and dry flue gas cleaning revealed lower environmental impacts in relation to the ecosystem quality.

40|$|Gas–solid {{carbonation}} of Air Pollution Control (APC) residues is a CO 2 Capture and Storage (CCS) technology, where highly reactive Mg- or Ca-bearing materials adsorb CO 2 {{and form}} stable Mg- or Ca-carbonates. The carbonation kinetics of this reaction {{have been studied}} at different temperatures, CO 2 concentrations, and at atmospheric pressure in order to select the best operative conditions {{on the basis of}} CO 2 stored and reaction time. The samples were initially heated up to the operative conditions under argon atmosphere and then carbonated under a CO 2 –argon atmosphere. All carbonation kinetics were characterized by a rapid chemically controlled reaction followed by a slower product layer diffusion-controlled process. Maximum conversions between 60 % and 80 % were achieved, depending on the operative temperature and CO 2 concentration. Temperature did not notably affect the maximum conversion obtained in the experiments performed at temperatures equal or above 400 °C; the influence on the kinetics was masked by the change in initial composition due to dehydroxylation reaction and surface area while heating up to the operative temperature. A slight influence of CO 2 concentration on the kinetics was observed, whereas no influence on the maximum conversion was noticed. The obtained results suggest that the flue gases with 10 vol. % CO 2 concentration can be directly used to form stable carbonates, thus lumping capture and storage in a single step. The APC residues produced from the <b>existing</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plants</b> would cover only 0. 02 – 0. 05 % of the total CO 2 European storage capacity required to comply with the Kyoto protocol objectives. Nevertheless, the proposed carbonation route could be applied to other residues, such as Cement Kiln Dust, Paper mill residues and Stainless Steel Desulphurization slags, characterized by a high content of free calcium oxides and hydroxides, thus increasing the impact of this process option...|$|E
40|$|Bottom ash is {{produced}} by the incineration of household waste. Waste regulations mandate that re-use of this residue be given priority. The goal of the investigations was to devine and test the process conditions of an integrated wet chemical treatment of bottom ashes in a bottom ash discharger. This should lead to an improved quality of bottom ashes. Easily soluble pollutants and fine particles should be removed by a washing process, and heavy metals of environmental significance should be stabilized {{by the addition of}} gaseous carbon dioxide or phosphoric acid in one and the same process. To achieve the above objectives, dry raw bottom ashes were removed continuously from three incineration plants, sieved into grain fractions and conditioned. Laboratory experiments were carried out in a glass reactor and a heating water reactor. Pilot-scale experiments were performed in a bottom ash discharger. Each type of treated and untreated bottom ash was characterized according to environmental and technical construction material criteria. Results indicated that easily soluble salts and fine particles were removed by the washing of bottom ash. In laboratory experiments, the concentrations of heavy metals in leachates after treatment could be lowered significantly by the addition of gaseous carbon dioxide or phosphoric acid. However, in pilot-scale experiments the concentrations of carbon dioxide or phosphoric acid in the process fluids were too low, and hence the expected stabilization of heavy metals was not achieved. The chemical reactions of the additives mostly happen in the washing solution. Stabilization can be reached only with a large amount of additives. In the case of phosphoric acid this would constitute a great expenditure of chemicals associated with a decrease in acid neutralization capacity of the bottom ash. After wet chemical treatment all bottom ashes exhibited a significant improvement of technical construction material characteristics. This procedure may be applied without incurring substantial investment costs by retrofitting <b>existing</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plants</b> to allow on-site washing of bottom ash. In addition the carbon dioxide from the cleaned flue gas can be used to accelerate the aging processes. A stabilization of heavy metals is possible mostly by changing the pH value in the leachates of the treated bottom ashes. The washing solutions could then be used in the washer system of the flue gas cleaning facility. (orig.)

40|$|Waste {{management}} {{represents an}} important issue in our society and Waste-to-Energy <b>incineration</b> <b>plants</b> have been playing {{a significant role in}} the last decades, showing an increased importance in Europe. One of the main issues posed by waste combustion is the generation of air contaminants. Particular concern is present about acid gases, mainly hydrogen chloride and sulfur oxides, due to their potential impact on the environment and on human health. Therefore, in the present study the main available technological options for flue gas treatment were analyzed, focusing on dry treatment systems, which are increasingly applied in Municipal Solid Wastes (MSW) incinerators. An operational model was proposed to describe and optimize acid gas removal process. It was applied to an <b>existing</b> MSW <b>incineration</b> <b>plant,</b> where acid gases are neutralized in a two-stage dry treatment system. This process is based on the injection of powdered calcium hydroxide and sodium bicarbonate in reactors followed by fabric filters. HCl and SO 2 conversions were expressed as a function of reactants flow rates, calculating model parameters from literature and plant data. The implementation in a software for process simulation allowed the identification of optimal operating conditions, taking into account the reactant feed rates, the amount of solid products and the recycle of the sorbent. Alternative configurations of the reference plant were also assessed. The applicability of the operational model was extended developing also a fundamental approach to the issue. A predictive model was developed, describing mass transfer and kinetic phenomena governing the acid gas neutralization with solid sorbents. The rate controlling steps were identified through the reproduction of literature data, allowing the description of acid gas removal in the case study analyzed. A laboratory device was also designed and started up to assess the required model parameters...|$|R

In 2000, Shenzhen land use has already exploited 80 %. With the urbanization, there are many migrant workers {{go to work and}} settle down in Shenzhen. The population grow up from 314, 100 to 10, 357, 938 in these thirty years. With the population growth, the problem is the garbage production volume increase more and more. Now, Shenzhen garbage production is 13, 100 t/d and the annual growth rate is 8 %. There are 8 districts in Shenzhen, which is Nanshan, Futian, Baoan, Luohu, Yantian, Longgang, Guangming and Pingshan district. Nanshan, Futian and Luohu district are downtown of Shenzhen. The other districts are still in developing process. In Shenzhen, there are 9 existing landfills and 7 <b>existing</b> <b>incineration</b> <b>plants</b> and 23 small informal landfills. With the urbanization, the relationship between landfills and city are changing. At the beginning, landfills were set far away the city. Their distance become closer and closer when both of them extended. Until now, some of landfills has connected and existed in the middle of city. For the land use situation of shenzhen. There are 80 % land use has already been exploited which means there is no more land for landfill in the future. However, the garbage volume increasing more and more and landfill is still the main way to treat garbage. It is a very serious issue need to face and solve. The garbage structure of shenzhen is, construction waste occupied 78 % and 22 % belongs to domestic waste. In this 22 % domestic waste, food waste occupied 65 %. Food waste is the biggest problem of pollution. However, the existing domestic waste treatment is still dumping the mix garbage to landfill. When food waste mix with the other domestic waste together, they will decompose and the produce a lot of biogas and dioxin and so on. It will produce serious air pollution, soil pollution and produce germs. That is why the existing landfill produce so serious pollution to the city. In other aspect, food waste is a good energy if we use it correctly. It could change to energy and fertilizer by biogas collecting, composting and chang to diesels. In Shenzhen, the government has already pay attention to garbage separation. Some communities has already implement garbage separation action. These are 3 large landfill of Shenzhen. The first one is Xiaping landfill of Luohu, the second one is Laohukeng landfill of Baoan and the yahoo landfill of Pingshan district. Base on the location situation, Yahoo landfill will be a best choice to make it as an experimental plot to plan. In Yahoo landfill, the existing landfill has already influenced thirty thousand surrounding people’s life. In future, the extension landfill will connect to the the residents area and polluted more seriously. So how to maximum reduce the pollutions is a urgent problem need to solve. The strategy is separating two part to solve garbage in this landfill. One for dumping, the other one is food waste composting. When the food waste composted to fertilizer, it will be transported to the surround farm lands to use. published_or_final_versionArchitectureMasterMaster of Landscape Architectur...|$|E
