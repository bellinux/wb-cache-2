The <b>electronic</b> <b>register</b> is a two-level system where interaction of two kinds of databases is carried out: the first level is the databases of separate medical organization; the second level is the central integrated database. The basic information for the <b>electronic</b> <b>register</b> are documents confirmed by the Health service Ministry of the Russian Federation, that is the coupon of the out-patient patient and a card of dynamic supervision over the patient with hypertensia. All the data about the patients, included in the register are subdivided into unchangeable and changeable ones.

40|$|Introduction: Monitoring of {{vaccination}} coverage {{is vital for}} the prevention and control of vaccine-preventable diseases. <b>Electronic</b> immunization <b>registers</b> have been increasingly adopted {{to assist with the}} monitoring of vaccine coverage; however, there is limited literature about the use of <b>electronic</b> <b>registers</b> in low- and middle-income countries such as Mongolia. We aimed to determine the accuracy and completeness of the newly introduced <b>electronic</b> immunization <b>register</b> for calculating {{vaccination coverage}} and determining vaccine effectiveness within two districts in Mongolia in comparison to written health provider records. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional record review among children 2 – 23 months of age vaccinated at immunization clinics within the two districts. We linked data from written records with the <b>electronic</b> immunization <b>register</b> using the national identification number to determine the completeness and accuracy of the <b>electronic</b> <b>register.</b> Results: Both completeness (90. 9...|$|R

40|$|Before the 1970 s, {{registers}} {{were primarily}} used for individual reference, for which purpose paper registers are quite adequate. The first <b>electronic</b> <b>registers</b> rationalised {{the collection and}} availability of information and improved the possibilities of collecting statistics. In the 1970 s, advanced statistics and prognoses were prerequisites for centralised social planning. From 1979 onwards, law regulated the use of <b>electronic</b> <b>registers.</b> This prevented the misuse of personal information concerning individuals. In the 1980 s, processes and results {{that had previously been}} viewed as immeasurable, became better defined and were becoming measurable. At the same time as <b>electronic</b> <b>registers</b> were adapting to their new functions, they were still being used for individual references. The study includes four case studies, each illustrating distinctive features in the history of <b>electronic</b> <b>registers.</b> With the registration of university students’ examinations, the Ministry was able to build up a result-orientated basis for the distribution of funds to the university, that is, the new register met new political needs. Establishing the Central Civil Registration meant that every citizen was given his/her own number which was used as an identi­fier in any state register concerning the citizens. Hence, pieces of information in different <b>electronic</b> <b>registers</b> could be combined. The <b>Electronic</b> Aliens <b>Register</b> replaced a huge paper register and made access to the register much easier for regional and state authorities than it had been previously. And finally, municipal autonomy made it difficult to establish the National Patient Registry. Local registers that referred to common guidelines had to be accepted in order for the registry to become functional...|$|R

40|$|A pragmatic three-tiered {{approach}} {{to monitor the}} world's largest antiretroviral treatment (ART) programme {{was adopted by the}} South African National Department of Health in 2010. With the rapid expansion of the programme, the limitations of the paper-based register (tier 1) were the catalyst for implementation of the stand-alone <b>electronic</b> <b>register</b> (tier 2), which offers simple digitisation of the paper-based register. This article engages with theory on implementation to identify and contextualise enabling and constraining factors for implementation of the <b>electronic</b> <b>register,</b> to describe experiences and use of the register, and to make recommendations for implementation in similar settings where standardisation of ART monitoring and evaluation has not been achieved. We conducted a qualitative evaluation of the roll-out of the register. This comprised twenty in-depth interviews with a diverse sample of stakeholders at facility, sub-district, and district levels of the health system. Facility-level participants were selected across five sub-districts, including one facility per sub-district. Responses were coded and analysed using a thematic approach. An implementation science framework guided interpretation of the data. We identified the following seven themes: 1) ease of implementation, 2) perceived value of an electronic M&E system, 3) importance of stakeholder engagement, 4) influence of a data champion, 5) operational and logistical factors, 6) workload and role clarity, and 7) importance of integrating the <b>electronic</b> <b>register</b> with routine facility monitoring and evaluation. Interpreting our findings through an implementation theory enabled us to construct the scaffolding for implementation across the five facility-settings. This approach illustrated that implementation was not a linear process but occurred at two nodes: at the adoption of the register for roll-out, and at implementation at facility-level. In this study we found that relative advantage of an intervention and stakeholder engagement are critical to implementation. We suggest that without these aspects of implementation, formative and summative outcomes of implementation at both the adoption and coalface stages of implementation would be negatively affected...|$|R
