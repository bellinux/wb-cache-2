This paper is to compare the wall’s <b>incline</b> <b>angle</b> or formability of SS 400 steel and SUS 304 stainless steel in single point incremental forming. The two materials are ferrous base alloyed, which have the different unit cell, mechanical property and chemical composition. They were forming into cone shape specimens having 100 mm diameter with different wall’s incline angle: 90 o, 75 o and 60 o. The investigation was continued until the specimens formed surface facture. The experimental result showed that the smaller the wall <b>incline</b> <b>angle</b> higher the formability with the both materials. The formability limit of the ferrous base alloy was approx. 60 o wall’s <b>incline</b> <b>angle.</b> By nature, SS 400 has higher formability than SUS 304.

40|$|Most of the {{existing}} screw drive in-pipe robots cannot actively adjust the maximum traction capacity, which limits the adaptability to {{the wide range of}} variable environment resistance, especially in curved pipes. In order to solve this problem, a screw drive in-pipe robot based on adaptive linkage mechanism is proposed. The differential property of the adaptive linkage mechanism allows the robot to move without motion interference in the straight and varied curved pipes by adjusting <b>inclining</b> <b>angles</b> of rollers self-adaptively. The maximum traction capacity of the robot can be changed by actively adjusting the <b>inclining</b> <b>angles</b> of rollers. In order to improve the adaptability to the variable resistance, a torque control method based on the fuzzy controller is proposed. For the variable environment resistance, the proposed control method can not only ensure enough traction force, but also limit the output torque in a feasible region. In the simulations, the robot with the proposed control method is compared to the robot with fixed <b>inclining</b> <b>angles</b> of rollers. The results show that the combination of the torque control method and the proposed robot achieves the better adaptability to the variable resistance in the straight and curved pipes...|$|R

5000|$|One {{limitation}} of any keel design is that, while the keel influence may vary, the suspension linkages themselves still disrupt the underbody airflow. This problem was exacerbated when the FIA introduced rule changes in [...] that forced teams to mount their front wing {{in a more}} elevated position. In response to this, many F1 teams have developed zero-keel chassis designs. Here the keel is removed entirely, and the suspension is mounted directly to the chassis. As the nose cone is in a raised position, this entails that the suspension arms take a distinctly <b>inclined</b> <b>angle</b> {{with respect to the}} road surface, reducing suspension efficiency. However, with continued restrictions to aerodynamic downforce through the use of aerofoil wings, and the lighter V8 engines specified from 2006 onwards causing weight distribution to shift forward, many designers apparently consider this drawback to be less significant than the concomitant increase in venturi downforce generated underneath the car; except for Renault and Red Bull, all of the teams in the 2007 Formula One World Championship used a zero-keel design.|$|E

The effect of inclined metal kiln of 0. 57 m 3 was also considered.
