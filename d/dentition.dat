5|$|Lemurs are unusual among {{primates}} {{for their}} rapid dental development, {{particularly among the}} largest species. For example, indriids have relatively slow body growth but extremely fast tooth formation and eruption.

Lemurs are also dentally precocious at birth, and have their full permanent <b>dentition</b> at weaning.|$|E
5|$|Marine mammals {{have evolved}} {{a wide variety}} of {{features}} for feeding, which are mainly seen in their <b>dentition.</b> For example, the cheek teeth of pinnipeds and odontocetes are specifically adapted to capture fish and squid.

5|$|Megalodon is now {{considered}} {{to be a member of}} the family Otodontidae, genus Carcharocles, as opposed to it previous classification into Lamnidae, genus Carcharodon. Megalodon's classification into Carcharodon was due to dental similarity with the great white shark, but most authors currently believe that this is due to convergent evolution. In this model, the great white shark is more closely related to the shark Isurus hastalis than to megalodon, as evidenced by more similar <b>dentition</b> in those two sharks; megalodon teeth have much finer serrations than great white shark teeth. The great white shark is more closely related to the mako shark (Isurus spp.), with a common ancestor around 4 mya. However, proponents of the former model, wherein megalodon and the great white shark are more closely related, argue that the differences between their <b>dentition</b> are minute and obscure.|$|E
40|$|Bite mark {{analysis}} {{offers the}} opportunity to identify the biter based on the individual characteristics of the <b>dentitions.</b> Normally, the main focus is on analysing bite mark injuries on human bodies, but also, bite marks in food may {{play an important role}} in the forensic investigation of a crime. This study presents a comparison of simulated bite marks in different kinds of food with the <b>dentitions</b> of the presumed biter. Bite marks were produced by six adults in slices of buttered bread, apples, different kinds of Swiss chocolate and Swiss cheese. The time-lapse influence of the bite mark in food, under room temperature conditions, was also examined. For the documentation of the bite marks and the <b>dentitions</b> of the biters, 3 D optical surface scanning technology was used. The comparison was performed using two different software packages: the ATOS modelling and analysing software and the 3 D studio max animation software. The ATOS software enables an automatic computation of the deviation between the two meshes. In the present study, the bite marks and the <b>dentitions</b> were compared, as well as the meshes of each bite mark which were recorded in the different stages of time lapse. In the 3 D studio max software, the act of biting was animated to compare the <b>dentitions</b> with the bite mark. The examined food recorded the individual characteristics of the <b>dentitions</b> very well. In all cases, the biter could be identified, and the <b>dentitions</b> of the other presumed biters could be excluded. The influence of the time lapse on the food depends on the kind of food and is shown on the diagrams. However, the identification of the biter could still be performed after a period of time, based on the recorded individual characteristics of the <b>dentitions...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{two species}} of Dermotherium were about {{as large as the}} Philippine colugo and larger than the Sunda colugo and {{differed}} from both in a number of characteristics of the <b>dentition.</b> Not enough is known of the skeleton of Dermotherium to assess whether the animal already possessed the gliding adaptations of living colugos. The two species are similar in size, but again differ in details of the <b>dentition.</b> In two specimens of D.chimaera, the length and width of the m2 are 5 and 4.3mm and 5.4 and 4.8mm respectively; this tooth is 5.4mm long and 4.9mm wide in the only known specimen of Dermotherium major. The Pakistani M2 of Dermotherium is 4.3mm long and 6mm wide, compared to 4.7 and 6.6mm in the only known M2 of D.chimaera from Thailand.|$|E
5|$|Although fewer postcranial remains {{have been}} {{discovered}} for Hadropithecus than for Archaeolemur, what has been found indicates that both were adapted for a terrestrial or semi-terrestrial lifestyle, an unusual trait for lemurs. Both genera had short limbs and a powerful build. Due to its specialized <b>dentition</b> and likely diet, Hadropithecus {{is thought to have}} been the more terrestrial of the two, since Archaeolemur may have sent more time foraging and sleeping in the trees. Both genera also have shortened hands and feet, an adaptation for walking on the ground.|$|E
5|$|In his 1935 work Handbuch der systematischen Weichtierkunde (Handbook of Systematic Malacology), Johannes Thiele {{introduced}} a mollusc taxonomy {{based upon the}} 1909 work by Cossmann and Peyrot. Thiele's system divided the bivalves into three orders. Taxodonta consisted of forms that had taxodont <b>dentition,</b> {{with a series of}} small parallel teeth perpendicular to the hinge line. Anisomyaria consisted of forms that had either a single adductor muscle or one adductor muscle much smaller than the other. Eulamellibranchiata consisted of forms with ctenidial gills. The Eulamellibranchiata was further divided into four suborders: Schizodonta, Heterodonta, Adapedonta and Anomalodesmata.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{number of}} teeth {{involved}} in cases of bite-mark analysis is generally fewer {{in comparison to the}} {{number of teeth}} available for cases of dental identification. This decreases the amount of information available and can hamper the distinction between bite suspects. The opposite is true in cases of dental identification and the assumption is that more teeth contribute to a higher degree of specificity and the possibility of identification in these cases. Despite being broadly accepted in forensic dentistry, this hypothesis has never been scientifically tested. OBJECTIVE: The present study aims {{to assess the impact of}} the quantity of teeth or tooth parts on morphological differences in twin <b>dentitions.</b> MATERIAL AND METHODS: A sample of 344 dental casts collected from 86 pairs of twins was used. The dental casts were digitized using an automated motion device (XCAD 3 DÂ® (XCADCAM TechnologyÂ®, SÃ£o Paulo, SP, Brazil) and were imported as three-dimensional dental model images (3 D-DMI) in Geomagic StudioÂ® (3 D SystemsÂ®, Rock Hill, SC, USA) software package. Sub samples were established based on the quantity of teeth and tooth parts studied. Pair wise morphological comparisons between the corresponding twin siblings were established and quantified. RESULTS: Increasing the quantity of teeth and tooth parts resulted in an increase of morphological difference between twin <b>dentitions.</b> More evident differences were observed comparing anterior vs. entire <b>dentitions</b> (p < 0. 05) and complete vs. partial anterior <b>dentitions</b> (p < 0. 05).

5|$|All {{cetaceans}} are carnivorous and predatory. Toothed whales mostly feed on {{fish and}} cephalopods, followed by crustaceans and bivalves. Some may forage with {{other kinds of}} animals, such as other species of whales or certain species of pinnipeds. One common feeding method is herding, where a pod squeezes a school of fish into a small volume, known as a bait ball. Individual members then take turns plowing through the ball, feeding on the stunned fish. Coralling is a method where dolphins chase fish into shallow water to catch them more easily. Killer whales and bottlenose dolphins have also been known to drive their prey onto a beach to feed on it. Other whales with a blunt snout and reduced <b>dentition</b> rely on suction feeding. Though carnivorous, they house gut flora {{similar to that of}} terrestrial herbivores, probably a remnant of their herbivorous ancestry.|$|E
5|$|At {{the close}} of the Ice Age, with the loss of cold and dry {{conditions}} and the extinction of much of its prey, the Beringian wolf became extinct. The extinction of its prey has been attributed to the impact of climate change, competition with other species, including humans, or a combination of both factors. Local genetic populations were replaced by others from within the same species or of the same genus. Of the North American wolves, only the ancestor of the modern North American gray wolf survived. The remains of ancient wolves with similar skulls and <b>dentition</b> have been found in western Beringia (north-east Siberia). In 2016 a study showed that some of the wolves now living in remote corners of China and Mongolia share a common maternal ancestor with one 28,000-year-old eastern Beringian wolf specimen.|$|E
5|$|Babakotia radofilai and {{all other}} sloth lemurs share many traits with living sloths, demonstrating {{convergent}} evolution.

Its <b>dentition</b> is similar to that of all other indriids and sloth lemurs. It lived in the northern part of Madagascar and shared its range with at least two other sloth lemur species, Palaeopropithecus ingens and Mesopropithecus dolichobrachion. Babakotia radofilai was primarily a leaf-eater (folivore), though it also ate fruit and hard seeds.

40|$|Although the {{lungfish}} (Dipnoi) belong {{within the}} Osteichthyes, their <b>dentitions</b> are {{radically different from}} other osteichthyans. Lungfish <b>dentitions</b> also show a uniquely high structural disparity during the early evolution of the group, partly owing to the independent variation of odontogenic and odontoclastic processes that are tightly and stereotypically coordinated in other osteichthyans. We present a phylogenetic analysis of early lungfishes incorporating a novel approach to coding these process characters in preference to the resultant adult dental morphology. The results only partially resolve the interrelationships of Devonian dipnoans, but show that the widely discussed hypothesis of separate tooth-plated, dentine-plated, and denticulated lineages {{is unlikely to be}} true. The dipnoan status of Diabolepis is corroborated. Lungfish <b>dentitions</b> seem to have undergone extensive and nonparsimonious evolution during the early history of the group, but much of the resulting disparity can be explained by a modest number of evolutionary steps in the underlying developmental processes, those for dental formation (odontogenic) and those for the remodeling of dentine tissue (odontoclastic). Later in lungfish evolution, this disparity was lost as the group settled to a pattern of dental development that is just as stereotypic as, but completely different from, that of other osteichthyans. 19 page(s...|$|R

5|$|<b>Dentition</b> is the {{key feature}} by which fossil rodents are {{recognized}} and the earliest record of such mammals comes from the Paleocene, shortly after the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs some 66 million years ago. These fossils are found in Laurasia, the supercontinent composed of modern-day North America, Europe, and Asia. The divergence of Glires, a clade consisting of rodents and lagomorphs (rabbits, hares and pikas), from other placental mammals occurred within a few million years after the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary; rodents and lagomorphs then radiated during the Cenozoic. Some molecular clock data suggest modern rodents (members of the order Rodentia) had appeared by the late Cretaceous, although other molecular divergence estimations are {{in agreement with the}} fossil record.|$|E

40|$|Intraoral digital {{impressions}} {{have been}} stated to meet the clinical requirements for some teeth-supported restorations, though fewer evidences were proposed for larger scanning range. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the accuracy (trueness and precision) of intraoral digital impressions for whole upper jaws, including the full <b>dentitions</b> and palatal soft tissues, as well as to determine the effect of different palatal vault height or arch width on accuracy of intraoral digital impressions. Thirty-two volunteers were divided into three groups according to the palatal vault height or arch width. Each volunteer received three scans with TRIOS intraoral scanner and one conventional impression of whole upper jaw. Three-dimensional (3 D) images digitized from conventional gypsum casts by a laboratory scanner were chose as the reference models. All datasets were imported to a specific software program for 3 D analysis by "best fit alignment" and " 3 D compare" process. Color-coded deviation maps showed qualitative visualization of the deviations. For the digital impressions for palatal soft tissues, trueness was (130. 54 Â± 33. 95) Î¼m and precision was (55. 26 Â± 11. 21) Î¼m. For the digital impressions for upper full <b>dentitions,</b> trueness was (80. 01 Â± 17. 78) Î¼m and precision was (59. 52 Â± 11. 29) Î¼m. Larger deviations were found between intraoral digital impressions and conventional impressions in the areas of palatal soft tissues than that in the areas of full <b>dentitions</b> (p 0. 05), but arch width was found to have a significant effect on precision of intraoral digital impressions for full <b>dentitions</b> (p = 0. 016). A linear correlation was found between arch width and precision of digital impressions for whole upper jaws (r = 0. 326, p = 0. 034 for palatal soft tissues and r = 0. 485, p = 0. 002 for full <b>dentitions).</b> It was feasible to use the intraoral scanner to obtain digital impressions for whole upper jaws. Wider dental arch contributed to lower precision of an intraoral digital impression.
