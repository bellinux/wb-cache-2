5000|$|Tobacco {{plants with}} an upright {{position}} of small patches of the seed bed are typically {{early signs of}} blue mold. These leaves are usually two to four centimeters in diameter, and normally spotted with yellow, gray, or a bluish mold in the lower surface. Younger plants that are up to four weeks old and {{are affected by the}} disease are easily killed by the fungus. Older plants become deformed and dark, indicating that parts of the plant are dead. In more severe cases the stem and root become infected and turn to a brownish color. The observation of downy mold in the lower surface of the leaf is the most reliable symptom of blue mold. Downy mold carries thousands of small reproductive units called conidia [...] If conidia forms at different spots in the seedbed an outbreak is more than likely to occur. The symptoms usually take place before it’s obvious. The symptoms evolve rapidly and are typically noticeable over night.The fungus frequently takes place when the vein of the leaves reaches vascular tissue of the stem, causing weakness and lodging. This infection is called [...] "systemic infection". The infection causes a stunt in growth and the leaves become narrow and short. The vascular system of the plants usually turns brown in color and the weakened stalk usually causing the stalk to fall over.The fungus is highly weather sensitive. During the time when the weather is cool, wet, or when there’s an overcast the disease can evolve in a greenhouse or field. The disease spreads rapidly because of the fungal pathogen. The rate of continental spread is based on the potential for high levels of inoculum and <b>effective</b> <b>wind</b> spores. When the weather is clear, dry, and hot the disease usually stops spreading and more than likely stops all together.|$|E

For individual blade pitch control, a separate preview estimate of the <b>effective</b> <b>wind</b> speed encountered by each blade must be available. One way of providing an estimate of the blade <b>effective</b> <b>wind</b> speed is to implement a hub mounted spinning lidar that scans the wind field at the rotational rate of the rotor such that the measured wind will reach the blade after some delay. In this way, both the lidar measurement and the wind turbine blade rotationally sample the wind field. The benefit gained by using preview wind speed measurements strongly depends on the correlation between the measured wind and the wind that interacts with the blades. In this research, the coherence between rotating lidar measurements and blade <b>effective</b> <b>wind</b> speed is calculated and analyzed using a spectral model of the wind field. The simulated wind field uses an isotropic von Karman spectrum and contains a model of wind evolution described by a longitudinal spatial coherence function.

30|$|Because of {{the power}} crises and {{environmental}} issues, renewable energy sources {{play a vital role}} in energy market. Among all renewable energy sources, wind energy is one of the rapidly growing energy technology and has its own benefits such as pollution free, clean and environmental friendly. In recent years, due to the advance in drive technology and grid interconnection control, the production of wind power is increased. Generally, WT has two different types: fixed speed WT (FSWT) and variable speed WT (VSWT). The main advantages of VSWT over FSWT is that, the annual power production is increased by 5 %– 10 %, and reduction in mechanical stress and power fluctuations [1, 2]. Generally, wind speed is classified into two types: below and above rated wind speed. Accordingly, the WT control is classified into two types: torque control and pitch control. At below rated wind speed, the main objective of the WT is, to maximize the wind energy capture from the wind by rotating the WT rotor at optimal rotor speed, which is derived from <b>effective</b> <b>wind</b> speed. At above rated speed, the main objective of the WT is to control the pitch angles which correspond to the reference power. In literature, some of the authors have discussed the control of WT with the assumption that the <b>effective</b> <b>wind</b> speed is available. In [3], a fuzzy controller was used to maximize the power capture, improve the efficiency, and the controller was found to be more robust to the wind gust and oscillatory torque. In [4], control algorithm based on fuzzy logic control (FLC) tracks the maximum power by controlling the WT rotor speed without estimating the <b>effective</b> <b>wind</b> speed. In WT control, several literatures reported either to estimate or to calculate the <b>effective</b> <b>wind</b> speed with WT control. In [5], the rotor speed and aerodynamic torque are estimated by the input and state based estimation with the known pitch angle, the <b>effective</b> <b>wind</b> speed is calculated by the inversion of the static aerodynamic model. In [6, 7, 8], Kalman filter is used to estimate rotor speed and aerodynamic torque, and finally the <b>effective</b> <b>wind</b> speed is calculated using Newton Raphson. For the single mass model given in [6, 7] and two mass model given in [8], nonlinear controllers such as nonlinear static state feedback with estimator and nonlinear dynamic state feedback with estimator (NDSFE) are used to control the WT at below rated wind speed. For both the controllers, the wind speed is estimated using Newton Raphson. In [9], calculation of <b>effective</b> <b>wind</b> speed is achieved by the particle filter, and FLC is used to control the WT at below rated wind speed. In [10, 11, 12], the SMC based controllers are applied to the WT without estimating the <b>effective</b> <b>wind</b> speed. References [10, 11] discussed higher order sliding mode control (HSMC) of WT at below and above rated speed and concluded that HSMC is more robust with respect to parameter uncertainty of the WT. In [12, 15], conventional SMC based control with adaptive sliding gain is used to control the WT where the sliding gain is varied by an adaptation algorithm.|$|E

[5] also studied the influence of blade number on power efficiency of Savonius turbine numerically, it was found that, the two-blade rotor is more efficient than three ones as well, and they clarified that the actual reason for the blade number influence is induced by the “shading effect”. From flowing field analysis, {{it is found that}} the <b>effective</b> concave <b>winding</b> area of the blade decreases due to the shading of the nearby blade for the three-blade Savonius turbine, while the <b>effective</b> convex <b>winding</b> area of the blade increases due to the addition of the other blade, which results in the lower power efficiency of three-blade Savonius turbine [5].|$|R

There are several criteria {{that have been developed}} and applied in different countries. These criteria are based on the definition of two independent parameters, a threshold <b>effective</b> <b>wind</b> speed and a probability of exceedence of this threshold speed. The difficulty of the criteria comparison arises from the two-dimensional character of the criteria definition. An effort is being made to compare these criteria, trying both to find commonalities and to clearly identify differences, in order to build up the basis for the next step: to try to define common criteria (perhaps with regional and seasonal variations). The first point is to define clearly the threshold <b>effective</b> <b>wind</b> speed (mean velocity definition parameters: averaging interval and reference height) and equivalence between different ways of defining the threshold <b>effective</b> <b>wind</b> speed (mean wind speed, gust equivalent mean, etc.) in comparable terms (as far as possible).

The criterion parameters and the Weibull function parameters are linked to each other, establishing a set called iso-criteria lines (the locus of the Weibull function parameters that fulfil a given criterion). The relative position of iso-criteria lines when displayed in a suitable two-dimensional plane facilitates the comparison of comfort criteria.

At these three stations, the significant ionospheric responses are near-simultaneous height disturbances after the sudden storm commencement (SSC) on April 6, 2000 and wave-like disturbances in the daytime on April 7.
