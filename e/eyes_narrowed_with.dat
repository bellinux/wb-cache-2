60|$|Once more {{brother and}} sister {{exchanged}} quick glances. Once more the men of Theos, as with one throat, shouted for Nicholas of Reist. Marie looked curiously towards the Prince. He was handsomer than Brand, broader and of finer presence. Yet her <b>eyes</b> <b>narrowed</b> <b>with</b> something which was akin to hate. In her heart she believed that her brother was making a great mistake. It was a Reist this people wanted, not one of his corrupt race.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} a surgical technique used in <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>narrow</b> palpebral fissure undergoing femtosecond laser flap creation without suction during laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). Methods: All data of 2 patient groups were collected through chart review. Group 1 consisted of 6 <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>narrow</b> palpebral fissure {{in which the}} suction ring was manually fixated and femtosecond laser was applied accordingly. Thirty comparison cases were randomly drawn from among eyes that underwent a standard LASIK procedure matched for age and preoperative refraction (group 2). Only 1 eye of each patient was selected to compare the refractive and visual outcomes between groups. Results: In all group 1 eyes, the flaps were created successfully with manual fixation of the suction ring without suction. No eyes lost 2 or more lines of vision. No {{significant difference was found}} in the safety and refractive outcomes between groups. Conclusion: Manual fixation of the suction ring in <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>narrow</b> palpebral fissure without suction was feasible for flap creation during LASIK...|$|R

40|$|AIM—To {{determine}} the mechanical effects of pilocarpine on the trabecular-iris angle opening in <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>narrow</b> angles, compared <b>with</b> {{its effects on}} healthy control subjects with wide angles.  METHODS—A narrow angle was defined as 25 ° or less of trabecular-iris angle on ultrasound biomicroscopic examination. The change in anterior chamber depth (ACD), trabecular-iris angle (TIA), angle opening distance (AOD, distance between trabecular meshwork and iris) measured at 250  µm and 500  µm from the scleral spur (AOD 250 and AOD 500), and iris thickness was determined in 30  eyes of 30  patients (13  men and 17  women, between 63  and 82  years (mean 70. 4  years)) <b>with</b> <b>narrow</b> angles and in 30  sex and age matched control subjects with wide angles before and 1  hour after the instillation of 2 % pilocarpine hydrochloride by ultrasound biomicroscopy.  RESULTS—In all <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>narrow</b> angles, pilocarpine increased the TIA, AOD 250, and AOD 500; these changes increased significantly and linearly as the corresponding pretreatment values decreased (r =  0. 807, p =  0. 0001; r =  0. 787, p =  0. 0001; r =  0. 852, p =  0. 0001). Of 30  eyes with wide angles, 23  eyes whose ACD was 2670  µm and more showed {{a decrease in the}} TIA, AOD 250, and AOD 500; the changes in TIA, AOD 250, and AOD 500 also significantly correlated with the corresponding pretreatment values (r =  0. 913, p =  0. 0001; r =  0. 882, p =  0. 0001; r =  0. 895, p =  0. 0001). Pilocarpine induced a smaller decrease in ACD in <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>narrow</b> angles than in those with wide angles (p =  0. 0001). There was a linear correlation between the increase in ACD change and the decrease in pretreatment ACD in <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>narrow</b> angles and those with wide angles (r =  0. 781, p =  0. 0003; r =  0. 798, p =  0. 0001).  CONCLUSIONS—The finding that pilocarpine increases angular width in patients <b>with</b> <b>narrow</b> angles indicates that this agent is useful for treating patients <b>with</b> <b>narrow</b> angles and angle closure glaucoma. The prediction of the pilocarpine induced change in the angle may assist ophthalmologists in treating such patients. ...|$|R
40|$|Phacoemulsification and posterior-chamber-lens {{implantation}} in {{eyes with}} acute angle-closure glaucoma compared to cataract extraction in their partner eyes. Methods: Twelve patients were included, one with bilateral angle-closure-glaucoma and eleven with unilateral glaucoma. Thirteen eyes with an elevated intraocular pressure {{due to an}} angle-closure were treated by phacoemulsification and IOL implantation and compared to 11 partner <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>narrow</b> angle (three previously treated by iridectomy) without intraocular pressure elevation. The average follow-up period was 15. 7 ± 2. 1 months. Results: The average intraocular pressure in eyes with angle-closure glaucoma was 54. 1 ± 14. 7 mmHg and in the partner eyes 22. 4 ± 8. 6 mmHg preoperatively. Follow-up pressure was 19. 3 ± 2. 0 mmHg in eyes with angle-closure glaucoma and 18. 8 ± 1. 8 mmHg in the partner eyes. Conclusion: Primary cataract extraction including posterior-chamber-lens implantation into eyes with angle-closure-glaucoma reduced intraocular pressure to normal levels, increased visual acuity, and decreased the number of antiglaucomatous drugs. Eyes with angle-closure-glaucoma do not respond differently to phacoemulsification and lens implantation compared to <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>narrow</b> angle without pressure elevation during and after phacoemulsification...|$|R
50|$|Dürer {{presents}} {{himself in}} similar poses and expressions in both his 1498 Christ as Man of Sorrows and 1503 charcoal drawing Head of the Dead Christ. Both {{are believed to}} be self-portraits, although they are not named as such. However, artist historians believe that since they bear remarkable similarities to his known self-portraits - including prominent <b>eyes,</b> a <b>narrow</b> mouth <b>with</b> a full upper lip, and the shape of both the nose and indent between lip and nose - that Dürer intended to represent himself in these works.|$|R
50|$|Its {{distinctive}} features are the pronounced constriction {{in the back}} of the head (as if the waist were {{in the back of}} the head), a shallow furrow along the middle of the back from between the eyes to near the sacral hump, and the short, rounded snout. Other distinguishing but not necessarily exclusive characteristics are: the small <b>eyes,</b> <b>with</b> <b>narrow</b> upper eyelids, the uniformerly granular dorsum, the pair of light, externally concave lines on the back (not too distinct in very dark animals), the blackish throat of males, and the absence of dark streaks along the sides of the snout. The basic dorsal color may be brown or dark gray, almost uniform or with obscure variegation or vermiculations of lighter gray. The males average 32.8 mm in length, while females average 34.6 mm.|$|R
500|$|The skull is {{relatively}} long {{and has a}} long, narrow rostrum (front region), broad interorbital region (between the <b>eyes)</b> and <b>narrow</b> braincase <b>with</b> almost vertically oriented walls at the sides and behind. It {{differs from that of}} T.talamancae in various proportions. Although the subspecies previously recognized in [...] "Oryzomys bombycinus" [...] have been separated by small differences in skull features, Pine rejected these {{on the basis of his}} much larger samples. Musser and colleagues agreed, but noted that Colombian animals appeared to have larger skulls. The zygomatic plates are broad and the zygomatic arches (cheekbones) behind them are nearly parallel to each other. The margins of the interorbital region contain prominent beads, which extend to the braincase as temporal ridges; these are usually less well-developed in T.talamancae. Unlike in T.talamancae and H.alfaroi, the parietal bone is usually limited to the roof of the braincase and does not extend to the sides.|$|R
