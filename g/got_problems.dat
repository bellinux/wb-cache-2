2500|$|Outside of the {{transsexual}} {{community and}} sexology researchers, this controversy is largely notable {{because of its}} implications for academic freedom and freedom of speech. [...] In an interview with The New York Times, Dreger said, [...] "If we're going to have research at all, then we're going to have people saying unpopular things, {{and if this is}} what happens to them, then we've <b>got</b> <b>problems</b> not only for science but free expression itself." [...] While Conway compared his work to Nazi propaganda, and Andrea James posted pictures of his children on her website with sexually explicit captions, other critics believe that their actions against Bailey and his book represent legitimate comment on a topic of public interest.|$|E
2500|$|In late 1985, after {{a series}} of cuts in {{university}} funding, Keele briefly considered merging with North Staffordshire Polytechnic, but negotiations collapsed. In September 1983, the Secretary of State, via the UGC, had encouraged the idea, asserting that the most radical way of increasing the size of departments and diminishing their number is by the merger of institutions. At the time, Keele had a population of 2,700 students, compared to 6,000 at the less academically exclusive Polytechnic. Edwina Currie, then Conservative MP for South Derbyshire, remarked, [...] "A university which is now below 3,000 students has <b>got</b> <b>problems.</b> It simply isn't big enough". Keele University Science & Business Park Ltd (KUSP Ltd) opened in 1986, partly to generate and diversify alternative sources of income.|$|E

2500|$|The book {{elicited}} both strongly {{supportive and}} strongly negative reactions. The controversial aspects included {{the contents of}} the book, whether the research was conducted ethically, whether it should have been published by the National Academies Press, and whether it should have been promoted as a scientific work. According to Benedict Carey's story in The New York Times, [...] "To many of Dr. Bailey’s peers, his story is a morality play about the corrosive effects of political correctness on academic freedom." [...] Interviewed by Carey, bioethicist Alice Dreger argues that [...] "what happened to Bailey is important, because the harassment was so extraordinarily bad and because it could happen to any researcher in the field. If we’re going to have research at all, then we’re going to have people saying unpopular things, and if this is what happens to them, then we’ve <b>got</b> <b>problems</b> not only for science but free expression itself." ...|$|E
