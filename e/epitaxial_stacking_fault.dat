40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a novel hybrid computational methodology {{in which the}} Molecular Dynamics and Kinetic Monte Carlo methods are concurrently combined. This hybrid methodology has been developed to simulate phenomena which are unfeasible to treat with either Molecular Dynamics or Kinetic Monte Carlo alone, due to {{the wide range of}} time scales involved and the need for highly detailed atom dynamics. Is is shown that the hybrid methodology can reproduce the results of a larger (more atoms) all Molecular Dynamics simulation at a significant reduction in computational cost (run time) - due to the replacement of Molecular Dynamics atoms with Kinetic Monte Carlo atoms. The hybrid methodology has been successfully used to study the dynamics of <b>epitaxial</b> <b>stacking</b> <b>fault</b> grain boundaries. This work identified that grain boundary motion was hindered by atoms lodging in off-lattice sites, and also by overlayer islands built up by adatom deposition. It was verified that the ‘kink flip” move is a key element in the motion of grain boundaries. Methods for enhancing the hybrid methodology were researched. It was shown that by an optimal choice of damping parameter γ, wave reflections back into the Molecular Dynamics domain could be minimised. This is expected to enable the hybrid methodology to operate successfully with smaller Molecular Dynamics domains, making larger and/or longer simulation runs feasible. This research included the derivation of the dispersion relation for the discrete case with damping and net reflectivity formulas. These are believed to be new results. The hybrid model can be applied {{to a wide variety of}} MD and KMC methods. Other MD potentials such as Embedded Atom or Modified Embedded Atom could be employed. The KMC component can be developed to use a more refined lattice or an ”on the fly” KMC method could be employed. Both the MD and KMC components can be extended to handle more than one species of atom. Parallelised versions of the MD and KMC components could also be developed. Any situation where the problem can be decomposed into distinct domains of fine scale and coarse scale modelling respectively, is potentially suitable for treatment with a hybrid model of this design...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{formation}} of <b>epitaxial</b> <b>stacking</b> <b>faults</b> in 2 in. diameter, dis-location-free (111) silicon wafers used in the fabrication of standard buried collector transistors has been made. The nucleation sites for the epitaxial faults are introduced uring the initial oxidation of the wafer and are correlated with the presence of a high density of shallow, flat-bottomed, saucer-shaped etch pits. The saucer pits are selectively annihilated in the diffused or im-planted regions during the fabrication of the Sb-doped buried collectors. For the ion-implanted process the annihi lation of saucer pits extends laterally from 50 to 100 ~m beyond the boundaries of the collectors. Following epi-taxial growth, <b>epitaxial</b> <b>stacking</b> <b>faults,</b> at a density of 104 cm- 2, are only found in those nonburied layer regions which have a saucer pit density of 106 - 107 cm- 2 before epitaxy.

40|$|The {{detection}} of particles and defects on or within films deposited on wafers using light scattering {{is of great}} interest to the semiconductor industry. Numerical calculation of light scattering characteristics from these features is very useful to the development and calibration of wafer inspection tools. A model and associated code is developed by using a modification of the discrete-dipole approximation (DDA) method to compute the light scattering from a feature with arbitrary shape on or within a filmed surface. The reflection interaction matrix is modified with the Sommerfeld integrals for filmed surfaces. Three-dimensional fast Fourier transform technique is used for accelerating the computation of light scatter from features associated with layered surfaces using the DDA method. Far field scatter is calculated approximately based on the reaction theorem. Model predictions of scattering signatures are compared with experimental results and other numerical models. Comparisons show good agreement for the cases considered, which demonstrates the accuracy and validity of the model. ^ An epitaxial silicon wafer defect sample was fabricated containing typical epitaxial wafer defects such as <b>epitaxial</b> <b>stacking</b> <b>faults,</b> spikes and mounds. Atomic force microscopy was used to determine their physical sizes and shapes. The optical scattering characteristics of these epitaxial silicon wafer defects were studied using the numerical model. A method to discriminate epitaxial crystalline defects and particles is proposed. ...|$|R

Therefore, the defects manifested by the epi growth are also an important concern. More specifically, <b>epitaxial</b> layer <b>stacking</b> <b>faults</b> can be detrimental to device performance and, {{in the case of}} image sensor devices, they have been shown to cause bright pixels and bright columns in the dark field. Assisting the Image Sensor Solutions Division of Eastman Kodak Company, the ability to screen and monitor incoming silicon has been accomplished and assessed using an unpatterned wafer particle inspection system, the Tencor 6220 Surfscan. A technique has been developed to review and characterize the defects mapped by the Tencor 6220. Initial evaluations show that 29 % of the light scattering defects are <b>stacking</b> <b>faults</b> on incoming silicon.

Each type of <b>stacking</b> <b>fault</b> produces a characteristic non-uniform broadening of peaks in the X-ray powder diffraction pattern of nickel hydroxide.

40|$|Potential-induced {{degradation}} of the shunting type (PID-s) of silicon solar cells is attributed to planar defects at the cell front surface. <b>Stacking</b> <b>fault</b> crystal defects with a length of few micrometers penetrating the p-n junction cause shunts when they are decorated with Na atoms. The target of this work is to improve knowledge on the formation of these <b>stacking</b> <b>fault</b> defects. Two approaches are utilized {{to find out if}} <b>stacking</b> <b>faults</b> develop during the cell process or if they evolve from defect nuclei during PID-stress. One approach is chemical defect etching and subsequent microscopy of <b>stacking</b> <b>fault</b> related signatures. Statistical evaluation of etched defects on cell areas with and without PID-s indicates that <b>stacking</b> <b>faults</b> are not present before PID stress is applied to the solar cell. The second approach utilizes iterative SEM/EBIC imaging of PID-shunts in the course of proceeding degradation.

Many of the <b>stacking</b> <b>faults</b> originate from extended string-like clusters that are present before electrical stressing and are observed at depths ranging from 10 to 100 µm below the SiC surface. Two possible mechanisms for creating these clusters are discussed: (1) nucleation of dislocation loops due to step bunching during epitaxial growth and (2) faulting of basal plane dislocations. Two alternate driving forces for <b>stacking</b> <b>fault</b> growth are also considered: mechanical stress relief and electronic energy lowering.

40|$|<b>Stacking</b> <b>fault</b> pyramids, trapezoids, {{tubes and}} tetrahedra have been {{identified}} by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in ZnSe/GaAs(001) epilayers. The { 111 } fault planes of the defects intersect in obtuse and acute stair-rod partial dislocations. Obtuse and acute stair-rod pairs in <b>stacking</b> <b>fault</b> trapezoids and tubes form dislocation dipoles. It has been established by TEM that degradation of devices based on ZnSe epilayers {{is due to the}} formation of threading dislocations from the <b>stacking</b> <b>faults.</b> The dislocation dipoles can act as diffusion channels for pipe diffusion of point defects during the degradation process.

Comprehensive characteristics were performed to investigate the influence of <b>stacking</b> <b>fault</b> structures on the photocatalytic activity and stability of CdS nanorod particles. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images revealed that the CdS catalyst included many nanorods with <b>stacking</b> <b>fault</b> structures. <b>Stacking</b> <b>fault</b> structures were obviously observed within CdS nanorods with the length ranging from 70 to 200 nm and diameter ranging from 20 to 65 nm, respectively.

The mechanisms for the formation of <b>stacking</b> <b>faults</b> in Fe-Mn-Al-C are considered, and we find that the impurities have influence on the <b>stacking</b> <b>fault</b> energies only when located within a few interatomic layers near <b>stacking</b> <b>fault.</b> As a result, the <b>stacking</b> <b>fault</b> energy does not depend on the average concentration of impurities in matrix, but is highly sensitive to the concentration of the impurities in the vicinity of <b>stacking</b> <b>fault</b> defect.

In the A-plane sample, a threading dislocation density {{in the same order}} was found, while the <b>stacking</b> <b>fault</b> density is much lower than in the M -plane sample.|$|R
40|$|Although nickel {{hydroxide}} can {{be obtained}} by various methods in a highly ordered form, this work shows that most such preparations are not free of <b>stacking</b> <b>faults.</b> The <b>stacking</b> <b>faults</b> belong to more than one type, which differ from one another in their structure as described by the local stacking sequence. The incidence of such residual <b>stacking</b> <b>faults</b> varies in the range 1 - 3 depending on the method of preparation. Â© 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
