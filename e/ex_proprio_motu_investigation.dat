If {{only a portion of}} a ruling is overturned, it is called cassation partielle, or partial setting aside. Sometimes, the Court may overturn a lower court ruling and judge the case <b>ex</b> <b>proprio</b> <b>motu</b> without being petitioned (cassation sans renvoi), as long as the merits and facts of the case are on record.|$|R
50|$|While upon a United Nations Security Council {{referral}} the Prosecutor {{can open}} an investigation against the national of any state, {{this is not}} the case with state referral and <b>proprio</b> <b>motu</b> <b>investigations</b> by the Prosecutor. A state party can opt out of these amendments, and nationals of non-states parties are not subject to the Court's jurisdiction. Additionally, the Prosecutor must wait for a determination of the Security Council regarding an act of aggression. If the Security Council determines an act of aggression has taken place, the Prosecutor may proceed. If the Security Council does not act within six months, the Prosecutor can proceed provided that a Pre-Trial Chamber approves that move. The Security Council keeps its right to defer investigations for a period of one year.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} to address perennial concerns, mostly raised {{in some quarters}} in Africa, pertaining {{to the development of}} the complementarity regime established by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. It grapples with a very important question, whether the principle of complementarity, embodied in article 17 of the Rome Statute, was formulated and is being applied by the ICC in a manner that upholds the ideals and theories upon which the regime was founded. The principle of complementarity is designed to mediate the imperatives of State sovereignty and a legitimate international criminal justice system. Essentially, complementarity gives States latitude to try genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and aggression nationally, with the ICC only intervening where States are either unable or unwilling to prosecute genuinely. Africa constitutes the biggest regional block of membership to the Rome Statute, however, over the years; support for the ICC on the African continent has waned. It has been argued in some quarters that the ICC is anti-African and that it has interpreted and applied complementarity in a manner that diminishes State sovereignty. The thesis argues that this tension may also be due to textual deficiencies inherent within the Rome Statute, in the provisions that embody this principle. It therefore examines complementarity from a theoretical perspective to provide a comprehensive account of the system contemplated by the drafters of the Rome Statute. In this regard, the thesis argues for expansion of States’ ability at the national level to deal with international crimes without compromising international criminal justice processes or threatening State sovereignty. This is suggested as a way of relieving the tension that has characterised the relationship between African States and the ICC. The thesis further sketches out some of the complexities inherent in the modalities through which the Court may exercise its complementary jurisdiction, particularly within the African continent, given that legal systems in most African countries are particularly weak. It thus dissects the provisions that outline the principle of complementarity in tandem with the Court’s interpretation and application of complementarity in practice. Furthermore, through an exploratory survey of the referral of the Situation in Uganda, and the ICC Prosecutor’s <b>proprio</b> <b>motu</b> <b>investigation</b> of the Situation in Kenya, the thesis illustrates how a positive approach to complementarity can help establish a healthy cooperative synergy between the ICC and States, thereby promoting a functional expeditious criminal justice system. This will go a long way towards assuaging State’s fears that the ICC merely pays lip service to complementarity and arbitrarily supersedes national jurisdiction...|$|R
40|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2012, the International Criminal Court (ICC) was invested with the examination of ﬁfteen cases in relation to seven different situations. Two of these relate to states that are not party to its Statute (Sudan and Libya) and were authoritatively referred by the United Nations Security Council (SC), while another three relate to party states that requested the Court to proceed in relation to crimes committed on their territory (Uganda, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Central African Republic). In addition, in March 2010, Pre-Trial Chamber II authorized the Prosecutor to initiate a <b>motu</b> <b>proprio</b> <b>investigation</b> {{on the situation in}} Kenya (party state) and on 3 October 2011, Trial Chamber III authorized the start of the <b>motu</b> <b>proprio</b> proceedings on the situation in Côte d’Ivoire (non party state to the Statute that in 2003 accepted the Court’s jurisdiction). Security Council and state practises in relation to the activation of the Court and the strategies of the Prosecutor in conducting investigations and prosecutions are interesting “detectors” of the level of effectiveness achieved by the international criminal justice system created by the Rome Statute...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{exercise}} of prosecutorial discretion during preliminary examinations at the International Criminal Court. The key questions it investigates are {{whether there is a}} secure legal and theoretical basis upon which such discretion can and should be exercised and whether the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court understands, develops and applies appropriate rules governing such discretion consistently. The study involves the analysis of various primary and secondary sources of law regulating {{the exercise of}} prosecutorial discretion. It begins by looking at the exercise of discretion at the national and international judicial systems to understand how their practices have informed and influenced the International Criminal Court Prosecutor, and then examines the provisions of the Rome Statute and its rules of evidence and procedure to determine the scope of the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. It also critically reviews the policy paper on preliminary examination adopted by the International Criminal Court Prosecutor. The study argues that, although the International Criminal Court Statute does not provide clear guidance on the exercise of prosecutorial discretion during preliminary examinations, there is a sufficient legal and theoretical basis upon which to exercise this discretion during preliminary examinations at the International Criminal Court. Article 42 of the Statute of the International Criminal Court, which provides for the independence of the Office of the Prosecutor is one such legal and theoretical basis. Thus, the Rome Statute clearly endorses the theory of prosecutorial neutrality. After expounding such a legal and theoretical basis, the thesis examines six case studies which represent six preliminary examinations conducted by the International Criminal Court Prosecutor in the conflicts in Uganda, Sudan, Côte d'Ivoire, Central African Republic, Kenya and Libya. The examination will answer the question whether the Prosecutor has exercised discretion in accordance with the spirit of the International Criminal Court Statute, and in a manner that would assuage claims that the Court is not neutral, especially in its dealing with African states. The analysis of these case studies shows that the Prosecutor has not exercised its discretion consistently and in a manner that can inspire public confidence in the administration of international criminal justice. To remedy this situation, the study recommends, among other things, the need for clarity on the exact roles of the Prosecutor and Pre-Trial Chambers during preliminary examinations, beyond the current practice where the Pre-Trial Chamber can only authorise the opening of <b>proprio</b> <b>motu</b> <b>investigations.</b> Second, the study recommends the review of the policy on the gravity of crimes. Although the policy paper on preliminary examination has clarified the fact that gravity involves both quantitative and qualitative analysis of victims of international crimes, it is not yet clear how to carry out gravity analysis. Third, the study proposes enhancing positive complementarity during preliminary examinations in order to encourage national efforts in the investigation and prosecution of international crimes. Finally, the study recommends that the decision to suspend or defer investigations or prosecutions in the 'interests of justice' under article 53 of the Rome Statute should be a shared responsibility between the Court and the United Nations Security Council...|$|R

After a deeply contested election in 2007, violence exploded across the country leaving many civilians hurt or dead.

40|$|Magister Legum - LLMKenya’s December 2007 Presidential {{elections}} {{sparked a}} wave of violent clashes over allegations of election rigging. The protests broke out along ethnic lines, causing greater civil unrest. There have been allegations that during these outbreaks of violence crimes against humanity were committed. This violence attracted world-wide concern and was universally condemned. Kenya is loathe to prosecute the perpetrators or those who bear the highest responsibility for the alleged commission of crimes against humanity. It has instead established a national investigatory mechanism, the Kenyan Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission (hereafter TJRC). This approach adopted by Kenya {{has been criticized for}} the fact that it fosters a culture of impunity. However, the Prosecutor of International Criminal Court (hereafter ICC) has used his <b>proprio</b> <b>motu</b> powers to initiate an investigation of alleged commission of crimes that fall within the jurisdiction of the Court. This research paper has analysed the reasons for the <b>proprio</b> <b>motu</b> intervention of the ICC in Kenyan situation. It also examined whether Kenya was unwilling or genuinely unable to prosecute the perpetrators of the post-election violence of 2007. Furthermore, the paper evaluated the provisions of the Kenyan TJRC, the major shortcomings of the Commission and the challenges it is facing in fulfilling its mandate. In conclusion the paper analysed the relationship between TJRC and ICC and re-evaluate any role that the two bodies could play in dispensing justice in Kenya. But before that, the paper laid down the factual background that led to the <b>proprio</b> <b>motu</b> interevention of the ICC in Kenya where a truth commission had alreday been established.
