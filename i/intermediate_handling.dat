5000|$|Milk {{has long}} been a staple food of {{agricultural}} societies. Fresh milk sours quickly if kept warm. Railways were used as early as 1840 to rapidly transport fresh milk from farms to cities. Early milk transport was in covered, tin-plated steel cans containing about 10 gal. Passenger trains typically offered the fastest service, so milk cans might have first been loaded into baggage cars. A farmer would adjust his herd milking schedule to have the milk cans filled shortly before scheduled arrival of the train. When multiple farmers required shipment, a separate car might be carried by the train specifically for milk cans; and that car could be delivered directly to the creamery to minimize time required for <b>intermediate</b> <b>handling</b> of the milk cans with other baggage.

40|$|The use of {{biocatalysis}} {{for industrial}} synthetic chemistry {{is on the}} verge of significant growth. Enzymes are remarkable catalysts: capable of accepting a wide array of complex molecules as substrates, and exquisitely selective, catalysing reactions with unparalleled chiral (enantio-) and positional (regio-) selectivities. As a results, biocatalysts can be used in both simple and complex transformations without the need for the tedious blocking and deblocking steps in organic synthesis. Such high selectivity also effords efficient reactions with few by-products, thereby making enzymes an environmentally friendly alternative to conventional chemical catalysts. The chemical production of dyes is extremely complex considering the great number and the variety of the reactions, intermediate compounds and end products. Usually these reactions can present risks with respect to the workers (toxic explosion, fire hazard by raw material and <b>intermediate</b> <b>handling)</b> but also for the environment (production of toxic and recalcitrant waste by-products). Therefore, there is an increasing interest to find alternative enzymatic processes for production of both existing and new dyes in order to develop cheaper, less dangerous and more environmental friendly reactions. Laccases are excellent oxidative enzymes for aromatic compounds substituted by electro-donating groups: diphenols (ortho- and para-), polyphenols, phenols substituted by a methoxyl. The enzyme also oxydizes ortho- and para-quinones, aminophenols, aryldiamines, and polyamines. These simple molecules can serve as precursors for enzyme catalysed production of dyes under mild conditions (room temperature, absence of acids). Some interesting results on synthesis of azo, phenazine and phenoxazine dyes using free or immobilized laccase will be presented.

Finally, by using interim source hopping, where various parts of a multicast message are being received by a client from different sources, a potentially high level of security can be achieved.

40|$|A {{process for}} {{recycling}} {{spent nuclear fuel}} cladding, a zirconium alloy (Zircaloy), into a metal powder {{that may be used}} for advanced nuclear fuel applications, was investigated to determine if it is a viable strategy. The process begins with hydriding the Zircaloy cladding hulls after the spent nuclear fuel has been dissolved from the cladding. The addition of hydrogen atoms to the zirconium matrix stresses the lattice and forms brittle zirconium hydride, which is easily pulverized into a powder. The dehydriding process removes hydrogen by heating the powder in a vacuum, resulting in a zirconium metal powder. The two main objectives of this research are to investigate the dehydriding process and to design, build and demonstrate a specialized piece of equipment to process the zirconium from cladding hulls to metal powder without <b>intermediate</b> <b>handling.</b> The hydriding process (known from literature) took place in a 95 percent argon - 5 percent hydrogen atmosphere at 500 degrees C while the dehydriding process conditions were researched with a Thermogavimetric Analyzer (TGA). Data from the TGA showed the dehydriding process requires vacuum conditions (~ 0. 001 bar) and 800 degrees C environment to decompose the zirconium hydride. Zirconium metal powder was created in two separate experiments with different milling times, 45 minutes (coarse powder) and 12 hours (fine powder). Both powders were analyzed by three separate analytical methods, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), size characterization and digital micrographs. XRD analysis proved that the process produced a zirconium metal. Additionally, visual observations of the samples silvery color confirmed the presence of zirconium metal. The presence on zirconium metal in the two samples confirmed the operation of the hydriding / milling / hydriding machine. Further refining of the hydride / milling / dehydride machine could make this process commercially favorable when compared to the high cost of storing nuclear waste and its components. An additional important point is that this process can easily be used on other metals that are subject to hydrogen embrittlement, knowing the relevant temperatures and pressures associated with the hydriding / dehydriding of that particular metal...|$|E

40|$|Municipal {{landfills}} received 36. 4 {{million tons}} of food waste in 2012, representing 14. 5 % of all municipal waste. Looking ahead to 2050 when the world population will exceed 9 billion people, the needed increase in food supply may exceed 70 % of current supply. Reducing food waste could provide a significant buffer to help with world food supply. In addition, disposal of food waste to landfills is not a sustainable means of disposal. A priority in reducing food waste is diverting edible food to food banks and other institutions which can utilize edible food. However, for food not acceptable for humans and inedible residues may be effectively used as animal feed. Currently the US produces about 375 billion pounds of animal feed annually for pets, livestock, horses, and fish. About 25 % of animal feed is derived from by-products of the oil, milling, rendering, and processing industries. A further hidden source of animal feed includes food refusals for shelf-life, packaging errors, blemishes, and other reasons. The food manufacturing sector reports it diverts about 30. 6 billion pounds or 70 % of total food waste to animal feed. The retail and wholesale industries divert about 14 % of food waste or 0. 53 billion pounds of food waste to animal feed. Significant barriers exist to using more food waste as animal feed. Barriers exist on the food manufacturing supply side and also on the nutritionist end user side of the relationship. Logistics of collection, transport, and storage create problems for both supplier and user as food waste contain a high water percentage and have poor stability, degrading easily with prolonged unrefrigerated storage. Regulations for food safety mandate only certain food items may be fed to certain animal species and specify heating requirements for safety. Nutritional variability and variability of supply {{make it difficult to}} use on a routine basis in many farm situations.

40|$|Prior {{research}} in our laboratory (Janssens, et al., 2003) (Carlier et al. 2012) demonstrated that class II-restricted T cell epitopes including a CXXS motif, or even better a CXXC motif (Schmidt, et al., 2006), within epitope flanking residues but {{outside of the}} MHC anchoring- or T cell contact residues, elicit cytolytic CD 4 + T cells. Acquisition of cytolytic properties results from an increased immune synapse formation between CXXC-peptide presenting APC and antigen-specific class II-restricted CD 4 + T cells. Upon cognate interaction with nominal antigen-presentingAPC, these cCD 4 + T cells induce apoptosis of APC, down-sizing as such the effector T cell pool and limiting the immune response. From these data (Carlier et al. 2012) a universal strategy to avoid or overcome unwanted immune responses was developed, as in theory any class II-restricted T cell epitope containing a CXXC motif could induce cCD 4 + T cells upon cognate recognition. One of many examples of such an undesired T cell-mediated immune response is the rejection of transplants. Transplantation offers a final solution for many end-stage diseased patients. Unfortunately, in the clinic, chronic rejection remains a problem despite progress in immunosuppressive treatment (Heeger & Dinavahi, 2012). Manifestation of adverse effects, i. e. cardiovascular disease,infection and malignancies, is detrimental for many patients on the long-term (Heeger & Dinavahi, 2012) (Meier-Kriesche, et al., 2003) (Euvrard, et al., 2003). Therefore, transplantation tolerance referring {{to a state of}} sustained specific non-responsiveness of the recipients immune system to donor alloantigens and allowing long-term allograft survival in the absence of potential harmful chronic immunosuppressive therapy (Golshayan & Pascual, 2008) remains an unreached goal for many immunologists. From a research approach, chronic rejection isconsidered to be caused mainly by indirect presentation of donor antigen (Game & Lechler, 2002), explaining the relevance of trying to intervene in MHC class II-restricted antigen presentation relying on the method proposed by our colleagues (Carlier et al. 2012). We hypothesized that by immunizing recipient mice with peptides derived fromdonor-alloantigens and containing a CXXC-motif, we would induce donor antigen-specific cytolytic CD 4 + T cells. Upon cognate recognition, the presence of such cCD 4 + T cells was suggested to result in induction of apoptosis specifically in APC presenting the nominal donor peptide. Specific elimination of such APC would down-size the donor-reactive effector population and would as such delay, prevent or down-regulate the rejectionprocess against donor tissue. Models to study this demanded a well-identified class II-restricted antigen unique to the donor and a donor antigen-carrying tissue or cell population to transplant. We opted for skin graft models considering their robustness and simplicity. Because we would work in a transplant setting and chronic rejection has been associatedwith indirectly-activated donor-reactive host T cells, we hypothesized that elimination of donor antigen-presenting APC might result in long-term donor-specific transplantation tolerance. Two models to study the intervention in an immune response (i. e. rejection of donor tissue) resulting from the indirect MHC class II-restricted presentation of an antigen (i. e. donor-specific antigen) were chosen. A first model, the H-Y model, depended on the immune response against the DBY antigen in C 57 BL/ 6 mice (Simpson, et al., 2001), generated when male cells or tissue are grafted into female recipients. A second model, the GFP-model, depended on the immune reaction in C 57 BL/ 6 mice against GFP-expressing cells ortissue (Matsuo, et al., 2007). For both models CXXC-containing peptideswere produced. Prolongation of skin graft survival (i. e. male and GFP-expressing respectively) in female wild type C 57 BL/ 6 mice treated with CXXC-containing peptide (i. e. ccDBY and ccGFP respectively), was observed in both experimental models and is described in Chapter 4. In the same chapter 4, in vivo experiments delivered proof-of-principle. When immunized with ccDBY peptide, female mice (n= 9) showed acceptance of male full-thickness skin grafts. In contrast, untreated control mice (n= 11) rejected their grafts from day 10 after transplantation. Immunization with the natural peptide, wtDBY, led to the spontaneous occurrence of acceptance in 4 out of 8 cases, though these mice were distinguishable from ccDBY-treated mice in appearance and graft infiltrate. Male grafts accepted by ccDBY peptide-treated female mice are described macroscopically as well as microscopically in this chapter. Hairgrowth, lack of both necrosis and contraction of the graft site, were characteristic observations. Mice were healthy and retained the capacity to mount an immune response towards unrelated antigens as demonstrated by a tetanus toxoid challenge (n= 7) and by rejection of a sex-matched GFP-expressing graft (n= 3). Microscopic investigation of graft biopsies showed a modest overall inflammatory infiltration in surviving grafts but aconcentrated T lymphocyte population, accumulating around the epithelium of hair follicles and epidermis, and spreading throughout the graft intime. This observation was more pronounced and advanced in mice rejecting their grafts, with infiltrates correlating to the lack of hair growth, necrosis and finally rejection of the grafts. The phenotype of T lymphocytes in accepted grafts was investigated and a raise in CD 8 + T cells, capable of graft destruction, and Foxp 3 +CD 3 + T cells, capable of preventing graft destruction, was observed in such grafts (n= 6). Presence of both suggests that a balance between both populations dictates the outcomeof graft tolerance in ccDBY-immunized mice. For immunization, ccDBY peptide was adsorbed on an adjuvant, i. e. alum. To avoid the misperception that effects were caused by the adjuvant rather than the peptide, we immunized mice with the adjuvant alone (n= 3) or with ccDBY peptideadsorbed on a different adjuvant (n= 8). Both experiments indicated thatthe adjuvant per se did not count for the observed tolerance. Important to note are the similarities between ccDBY-immunized male-tolerant mice and untreated mice tolerant for a syngeneic graft (n= 8). A parallel with the natural process of self-tolerance means that ccDBY-induced graft survival is of physiological relevance and might rely on the same mechanisms. Subsequently, we extrapolated our findings from the male-to-female DBY skin grafting model to another donor/recipient mismatch setting with ease of post-operational evaluation. In awild type C 57 BL/ 6 female mouse, immunization with ccGFP peptide (n= 5) produced in a similar way as ccDBY peptide, resulted in tolerance of a sex-matched GFP-expressing skin graft, compared to rejection in untreated recipients (3 out of 4 rejected) and accelerated rejection in wtGFP-treated recipients (n= 5). Not only did ccDBY peptide immunization prevent male skin graft rejection in naïve female recipients for the initial follow-up period of 21 days, it still did so after several months. These long-term tolerant female mice (n= 3) were demonstrated to be capable of accepting a second identical male skin graft, without intermediate treatment. Reminiscent of the successive male skin graft acceptance in female ccDBY-treated mice, ccGFP-treated female mice tolerating a first female GFP-graft on a long-term base (> 90 days) could accept a second identical skin graft without <b>intermediate</b> <b>handling</b> (4 out of 5 accepted therecall graft). In Chapter 5, it was demonstrated in vitro that ccDBY immunization, which had led to prolonged graft survival in vivo, indeed induces a population of CD 4 + T cells with specific function and phenotype. To this end, CD 4 + T cells were cloned. The CD 4 + T cell clone (cyt 1 / 8) was specific for DBY and capable of inducing cell death in male APC in vitro. The cytolytic capacity of this clone was confirmed in vivo with the specific elimination of male APC but not female APC in a male mouse. Since we were in possession of female transgenic Marilyn micewhose T cell population solely consists of DBY-specific CD 4 + T cells, we immunized such mice with ccDBY peptide and isolated CD 4 + T cells. After expansion of the DBY-specific population, such cells were evaluated for their cytolytic activity and they were shown to be capable of diminishing the living population of professional male APC, i. e. male dendritic cells and male B cells. Both CD 4 + T cell lines were characterized for phenotype, which led to the common finding of those cells being terminally differentiated effector/memory CD 4 + T cells. Of note, though these cells were induced by ccDBY immunization, the cells were negative for the regulatory T cell marker Foxp 3. In accordance to their cytolytic function towards male APC, these cells stained positive for markers implicated in apoptosis induction, GZB and FasL. These phenotypic characteristics were established on a single T cell clone and need to be confirmedwith other clones and/or polyclonal T cells. However, the findings presented here match closely what has been observed in other investigation fields, namely multiple sclerosis and insulin dependent diabetes (unpublished data) and we therefore conclude that our present findings are relevant. In the same chapter we proposed a suggestive mechanism behind tolerance induction upon ccDBY immunization. We propose a dynamic cellular interaction between spleen, graft-draining lymph node and graft site, resulting in male skin graft acceptance. An explanation for occasionally observed tolerance in wtDBY-treated mice is proposed in this chapter. As illustrated in an ELISpot assay, neither ccDBY-immunization nor wtDBY-immunization did deplete the CD 4 + effector population. However, the DBY-specific CD 4 + effector T cell population in wtDBY-immunized mice was smaller than the one seen in ccDBY-treated mice. Repeated administration of the strong wtDBY peptide might have led to activation-induced cell death (AICD) in DBY-reactive CD 4 + T cells, correlating with the lower number of CD 4 + T cells and the spontaneous occurrence of tolerance in wtDBY-treated mice. Of course, this matter requires further investigation, but it indicates that prolonged graft survival observed in ccDBY-treated and some wtDBY-treated mice relies on distinct mechanisms. In ccDBY-treated mice an effector population remains present but is held in check by other cell populations, Treg and/or cytolytic CD 4 + Tcells, whereas wtDBY-treated mice show prolonged graft survival seemingly due to a loss in effector T cells which might be caused by an overactive natural process to control effector T cell populations, namely AICD. To conclude, we believe that we have obtained proof-of-principle for a new universal strategy of preventing an unwanted immune response. We demonstrated in two minor mismatch models of skin transplantation that immunization prior to transplantation with a CXXC-containing donor-specific antigen can prolong skin graft survival for > 3 months,what we considered as acceptance. Recipient mice showed preserved immune competency and remained healthy. Considering the observed presence of donor antigen-specific CD 4 + T cells with cytolytic function towards donor antigen presenting APC in CXXC-containing peptide treated mice and theprior work of colleagues, we see this elimination of APC which present donor antigen as a major cause for prolonged skin graft survival. status: publishe...|$|E

This review highlights pot-in-pot reactions (multiple reactions {{carried out in}} one pot by separating key reactions with a thin polymeric membrane) as an efficient, green synthetic alternative to conventional synthesis. We discuss the advantages of homogeneous processes to develop new cascade reaction sequences by reviewing the use of polymeric thimbles as selective semi-permeable walls. These thimbles allow small organic molecules to diffuse through while retaining polar reagents, polar solvents, and/or organometallic catalysts. The dynamic and versatile nature of this technique is demonstrated by performing 2 - and 3 -step cascade reactions in one glass pot. A pot-in-pot reaction approach to synthesis circumvents the need to isolate <b>intermediates,</b> or <b>handling</b> of toxic/unpleasant by-products, therefore enabling synthesis of otherwise challenging molecules, improving the efficiency, or enabling greener approaches to modular synthesis...|$|R

The summation over bound and continuum <b>intermediate</b> states is <b>handled</b> by solving the equivalent inhomogeneous differential equation. Exact summation results differ by a factor of 2 from a rough estimate obtained by limiting the intermediate state summation to one bound state. Higher order electron correlation effects are also examined...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{augmented}} graph model, as {{introduced by}} Kleinberg (STOC 2000), is an appealing model for analyzing navigability in social networks. Informally, {{this model is}} defined by a pair (H, ϕ), where H is a graph in which inter-node distances {{are supposed to be}} easy to compute or at least easy to estimate. This graph is ”augmented ” by links, called long-range links, which are selected according to the probability distribution ϕ. The augmented graph model enables the analysis of greedy routing in augmented graphs G ∈ (H, ϕ). In greedy routing, each <b>intermediate</b> node <b>handling</b> a message for a target t selects among all its neighbors in G the one that is the closest to t in H and forwards the message to it. This paper addresses the problem of checking whether a given graph G is an augmented graph. It answers part of the questions raised by Kleinberg in his Problem 9 (Int. Congress of Math. 2006). More precisely, given G ∈ (H, ϕ), we aim at extracting the base graph H an...|$|R
40|$|In modern Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), textual editors are {{interactive}} and can <b>handle</b> <b>intermediate,</b> incomplete, {{or otherwise}} erroneous texts while still providing editor {{services such as}} syntax highlighting, error marking, outline views, and hover help. In this paper, we present an approach for the robust synchronization of interactive textual and graphical editors. The approach recovers from errors during parsing and text-to-model synchronization, preserves textual and graphical layout {{in the presence of}} erroneous texts and models, and provides synchronized editor services such as selection sharing and navigation between editors. It was implemented for synchronizing textual editors generated by the Spoofax language workbench and graphical editors generated by the Graphical Modeling Framework...|$|R
5000|$|Following World War II and the {{establishment}} of the NATO alliance, there was pressure to adopt a standard rifle, alliance-wide. The FAL was originally designed to <b>handle</b> <b>intermediate</b> cartridges, but in an attempt to secure US favor for the rifle, the FAL was redesigned to use the newly developed 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge. The US tested several variants of the FAL to replace the M1 Garand. These rifles were tested against the T44, essentially an updated version of the basic Garand design. [...] Despite the T44 and T48 showing performing similarly in trials, the T44 was, for several reasons, selected and the US formally adopted the T44 as the M14 service rifle.|$|R
5000|$|In a radio {{receiver}} circuit, the RF front end is a generic term {{for all the}} circuitry between the antenna {{up to and including}} the mixer stage. [...] It consists of all the components in the receiver that process the signal at the original incoming radio frequency (RF), before it is converted to a lower intermediate frequency (IF). In microwave and satellite receivers it is often called the low-noise block (LNB) or low-noise downconverter (LND) and is often located at the antenna, so that the signal from the antenna can be transferred {{to the rest of the}} receiver at the more easily <b>handled</b> <b>intermediate</b> frequency.|$|R
40|$|This work {{addresses}} the scheduling of continuous single stage multiproduct plants with parallel units and shared storage tanks. Processing tasks are energy intensive and we consider timedependent electricity pricing and availability together with multiple <b>intermediate</b> due dates, <b>handled</b> as hard constraints. A new discrete-time aggregate formulation is proposed to rapidly plan the production levels. It {{is combined with}} a continuous-time model for detailed scheduling as the essential part of a rolling horizon algorithm. Their computational performance is compared to traditional discrete and continuous-time full-space formulations with all models relying on the Resource-Task Network (RTN) process representation. The results show that new models and algorithm can generate global optimal schedules much more efficiently {{than their counterparts in}} problems involving unlimited power availability. Under restricted power, the aggregate mode...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Subgraph {{matching}} is {{the task}} of finding all matches of a query graph in a large data graph, which is known as an NP-complete problem. Many algorithms are proposed {{to solve this problem}} using CPUs. In recent years, Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have been adopted to accelerate fundamental graph operations such as breadth-first search and shortest path, owing to their parallelism and high data throughput. The existing subgraph matching algorithms, however, face challenges in mapping backtracking problems to the GPU architectures. Moreover, the previous GPU-based graph algorithms are not designed to <b>handle</b> <b>intermediate</b> and final outputs. In this paper, we present a simple and GPU-friendly method for subgraph matching, called GpSM, which is designed for massively parallel architectures. We show that GpSM out-performs the state-of-the-art algorithms and efficiently answers subgraph queries on large graphs. ...|$|R
