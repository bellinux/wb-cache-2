5|$|Malaysia {{signed the}} Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 12 June 1993, {{and became a}} party to the {{convention}} on 24 June 1994. It has subsequently produced a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, which was received by the convention on 16 April 1998. The country is megadiverse with a high number of species and high levels of <b>endemism.</b> It is estimated to contain 20percent of the world's animal species. High levels of <b>endemism</b> are found on the diverse forests of Borneo's mountains, as species are isolated from each other by lowland forest. There are about 210 mammal species in the country. Over 620 species of birds have been recorded in Peninsular Malaysia, with many endemic to the mountains there. A high number of endemic bird species are also found in Malaysian Borneo. 250 reptile species have been recorded in the country, with about 150 species of snakes and 80 species of lizards. There are about 150 species of frogs, and thousands of insect species. Malaysia's exclusive economic zone is 1.5 times larger than its land area, and some of its waters are in the Coral Triangle, a biodiversity hotspot. The waters around Sipadan island are the most biodiverse in the world. Bordering East Malaysia, the Sulu Sea is a biodiversity hotspot, with around 600 coral species and 1200 fish species. The unique biodiversity of Malaysian Caves always attracts lovers of ecotourism from all over the world.|$|E
5|$|Myxogastria are {{distributed}} worldwide; species were found by early researchers on all continents. However, as {{many parts of}} the world were yet not discovered or explored, the exact distribution is not fully known. Europe and North America are often considered the basic habitat of the Myxogastria species. According to recent research, the majority of species are not widely distributed. The Myxogastria are most commonly found in temperate latitudes, and rarely in the polar regions, the subtropics or tropics. The physical features of the substrate and climatic conditions are the major aspects of the species' presence. <b>Endemism</b> is rare.|$|E

5|$|The fauna of Puerto Rico {{is similar}} to other island {{archipelago}} faunas, with high <b>endemism,</b> and low, skewed taxonomic diversity. Bats are the only extant native terrestrial mammals in Puerto Rico. All other terrestrial mammals in the area were introduced by humans, and include species such as cats, goats, sheep, the small Asian mongoose, and escaped monkeys. Marine mammals include dolphins, manatees, and whales. Of the 349 bird species, about 120 breed in the archipelago, and 47.5% are accidental or rare.|$|E
5|$|About 10% of Lord Howe Island's forests {{have been}} cleared for agriculture, and another 20% has been disturbed, mostly by {{domestic}} cattle and feral sheep, goats and pigs. As a result, 70% {{of the island}} remains relatively untouched {{with a variety of}} plants and animals, many of which are endemic, some of which are rare or threatened. Two species of plants, nine terrestrial birds, one bat and at least four invertebrates have become extinct since 1778. <b>Endemism</b> at the generic level includes the palms Howea, Hedyscepe and Lepidorrhachis, a woody daisy Lordhowea, the tree Negria, the leech Quantenobdella howensis, three annelid worm genera (Paraplutellus, Pericryptodrilus and Eastoniella), an isopod shrimp Stigmops, a hemipteran bug Howeria and a cricket Howeta.|$|E
5|$|At least 1300 cicada {{species are}} {{distributed}} worldwide {{with the majority}} being in the tropics.

5|$|Hawaii's {{geographical}} isolation strongly influences its ecology. Remote islands like Hawaii have a {{large number}} of species that are found nowhere else (see <b>Endemism</b> in the Hawaiian Islands). The remoteness resulted in evolutionary lines distinct from those elsewhere and isolated these endemic species from external biotic influence, and also makes them especially vulnerable to extinction and the effects of invasive species. In addition the ecosystems of Hawaii are under threat from human development including the clearing of land for agriculture; an estimated third of the island's endemic species have already been wiped out. Because of its elevation, Mauna Kea has the greatest diversity of biotic ecosystems anywhere in the Hawaiian archipelago. Ecosystems on the mountain form concentric rings along its slopes due to changes in temperature and precipitation with elevation. These ecosystems can be roughly divided into three sections by elevation: alpine–subalpine, montane, and basal forest.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Rasmussen {{was part}} of a large multi-institutional {{collaboration}} investigating biodiversity hotspots, which have a prominent role in conservation. The study assessed locations quantitatively for three criteria of bird diversity – species richness, the level of threat, and the number of <b>endemism</b> species. The results demonstrated that hotspots did not show the same geographical distribution for each factor. Only 2.5% of hotspot areas are common to all three aspects of diversity, with over 80% of hotspots registering on only one criterion. Each criterion explained less than 24% of the variation in the other factors, suggesting that even within a single taxonomic class, different mechanisms are responsible for the origin and maintenance of various aspects of diversity. Consequently, the different types of hotspots also vary greatly in their utility as conservation tools.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar {{is one of}} {{the poorest}} {{countries}} in the world, with a high population growth rate of 2.5%per year and nearly 70% of the population living in poverty. The country is also burdened with high levels of debt and limited resources. These socioeconomic issues have complicated conservation efforts, even though the island of Madagascar has been recognized by IUCN/SSC as a critical primate region for over 20years. Due to its relatively small land area—587,045km2 (226,659sq mi)—compared to other high-priority biodiversity regions and its high levels of <b>endemism,</b> the country {{is considered one of the}} world's most important biodiversity hotspots, with lemur conservation being a high priority. Despite the added emphasis for conservation, there is no indication that the extinctions that began with the arrival of humans have come to an end.|$|E

40|$|The endemic {{diversification}} of the Cape zone fauna and the phylogenetic {{relationships among the}} 30 species of the blister beetle genus Iselma are investigated. We analysed morphological, molecular (mtDNA 16 S) and combined datasets of characters using a number of approaches (maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference analyses). We propose hypotheses of diversification times among taxa from molecular clock analyses. Morphological and molecular analyses produced similar results. According to maximum likelihood molecular studies, radiation within the genus Iselma occurred during the Pliocene and Pleistocene, roughly contemporaneously with the shift in African climate, vegetation and faunal assemblages. Two main lineages, one Namibian and one South African, separated c. 4. 9 Ma. Within the South African lineage we identify two groups of endemic species, one in Little Karoo and one that extend towards southern Namaqualand. The remaining South African groups of species are spread through Namaqualand and the southwestern Cape area. These include several <b>endemisms,</b> with different times of diversification during the Pleistocene, probably related in part to glacial cycles. These <b>endemisms</b> are distributed in small areas of the following ecosystems: coastal Strandveld, Succulent Karoo and particularly Fynbos...|$|R

5|$|Puerto Rico's herpetofauna {{consists}} of 25 amphibian species and 61 reptile species. The majority of West Indian terrestrial reptile clade {{is believed to}} have arrived by flotsam dispersion from South America. Little evidence exists to support the alternative hypothesis of proto-Antillean vicariance. Other terrestrial herpetofauna are believed to have arrived to the West Indies (and Puerto Rico) by the same method and subsequently undergone vicarization by banks or islands. As a result, Puerto Rico, and the Caribbean in general, {{has one of the highest}} percentages of <b>endemism</b> among amphibians and reptiles in the world. Amphibian species in Puerto Rico belong to four families: Bufonidae (2 species), Hylidae (3), Leptodactylidae (18) and Ranidae (2). Reptiles include turtles (freshwater and marine), lizards, worm lizards, snakes and a caiman.|$|E

5|$|The {{species has}} been found growing in small groups in the Guineo-Congolian rainforest. This forest is {{dominated}} by the single canopy tree species Gilbertiodendron dewevrei. Not only does this tree provide food in the form of edible seeds {{for a wide variety of}} large mammals, it forms mycorrhizal relationships with P.bembae. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of the plant, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. The ectomycorrhizal symbiosis is thought to contribute to the success of the dominant species, by allowing it access to nutrients otherwise unavailable. The Congolian forests encompass an ecoregion known for its species richness and <b>endemism,</b> which is spread across four countries: Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of Congo, and the Central African Republic.|$|E
5|$|In {{geological}} terms at 7million {{years old}} Lord Howe Island is relatively young {{and was never}} part of any continent, its flora and fauna colonising the island from across the sea, carried by wind, water or birds, possibly assisted at a geological time when other islands were exposed, enabling island hopping. Nevertheless, it is far enough away and has had sufficient time to evolve endemic species. The high degree of <b>endemism</b> is emphasised {{by the presence of}} five endemic genera: Negria, Lordhowea, Howea, Lepidorrhachis, and Hedyscepe. Island plants {{are similar to those of}} Norfolk Island, the two islands sharing some endemic species, for example, the critically endangered species of creeping vine Calystegia affinis. The combined flora of these two islands is more closely related to that of New Zealand and New Caledonia than to that of Australia. There is also a small but clear link with the plants of Vanuatu. The closest mainland affinities are with the vegetation of subtropical southeastern Queensland.

40|$|Background: The {{populations of}} Soldanella (Primulaceae) of the {{southern}} Apennines (Italy) are unique within the genus for their distribution and ecology. Their highly fragmented distribution range, with three main metapopulations {{on some of the}} highest mountains (Gelbison, Sila and Aspromonte massifs) of the area, poses intriguing questions about their evolutionary history and biogeography, and about the possibility of local <b>endemisms.</b> Aims and methods: In order to clarify the phylogeny and biogeography of the three metapopulations of Soldanella in the southern Apennines, attributed to S. calabrella to date, and to identify possible local <b>endemisms,</b> a comparative approach based on the study of molecular, morphological and ecological characteristics of the populations was employed. Specifically, one nuclear (total ITS) and two plastid (rbcL and trnL) markers were used for the phylogenetic analyses, performed through both maximum likelihood and Bayesian techniques. Among the morphological features, the glandular hair and leaf biometric traits were analysed, and the environment in which the populations grew was characterised for altitude, forest canopy composition and soil pH, C, N and organic matter. Results and conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that the lineage of Soldanella of southern Italy diverged from the Carpathians lineage during the Middle Pleistocene, and underwent an evolutionary radiation during the Late Pleistocene. The populations of the Sila and Aspromonte massifs diverged from the populations of the Gelbison massif around 380000 years ago and are probably undergoing a progressive differentiation due to their isolation. The populations on the Gelbison massif, moreover, have different morphological features from those of the Sila and Aspromonte massifs and a different ecological niche. The molecular, morphological and ecological data clearly demonstrate that the metapopulation of Soldanella on the Gelbison massif belongs to a new taxonomic unit at the species level, which we name Soldanella sacra A. & L. Bellino from the name of the massif on which it was discovered, the “Holy Mountain”...|$|R

5|$|The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) {{divides the}} waters of the Columbia and its tributaries into three {{freshwater}} ecoregions, naming them Columbia Glaciated, Columbia Unglaciated, and Upper Snake. The Columbia Glaciated ecoregion, making up {{about a third of the}} total watershed, lies in the north and was covered with ice sheets during the Pleistocene. The ecoregion includes the mainstem Columbia north of the Snake River and tributaries such as the Yakima, Okanagan, Pend Oreille, Clark Fork, and Kootenay rivers. The effects of glaciation include a number of large lakes and a relatively low diversity of freshwater fish. The Upper Snake ecoregion is defined as the Snake River watershed above Shoshone Falls, which totally blocks fish migration. This region has 14species of fish, many of which are endemic. The Columbia Unglaciated ecoregion makes up the rest of the watershed. It includes the mainstem Columbia below the Snake River and tributaries such as the Salmon, John Day, Deschutes, and lower Snake Rivers. Of the three ecoregions it is the richest in terms of freshwater species diversity. There are 35species of fish, of which four are endemic. There are also high levels of mollusk <b>endemism.</b>|$|E
