So his requirements to get to Paris are, like, beyond platinum editions; they're, like, beyond ultra-platinum editions; they're like diamond editions. So we love Snoop and we wish he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>here,</b> but I think shooting him in L.A. will be good because we'll have more time, more control. He probably would have gotten really mobbed in the streets here anyway.|$|E

25|$|The 156th Parachute Battalion and {{the rest}} of the 4th Parachute Brigade landed to the west of Arnhem on the second day of the battle 18 September 1944. Their {{objective}} was to hold a position on the high ground north of Arnhem at Koepel. With the 156th Parachute Battalion leading on the right followed by the 10th Battalion on the left. By dawn the following day the battalion was just north of the Utrecht to Arnhem railway line. When they came under attack from German 88mm guns. Both battalions were ordered to start an assault on the position at 07:00. After repeated attacks the battalion got no further forward. The defenders from the 9th SS Panzer Division <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>here</b> for two days and were well dug in. The German position included infantry, self propelled guns and armoured cars. The battalion fought all day in the woods but its losses were very heavy, with 'A' Company losing all of its officers. Finally brigade headquarters obtained permission to withdraw south of the rail line into Oosterbeek. The battalion started to pull back over the rail line but in the confusion of the withdrawal no orders had been given about where they were to go once south of the rail line. Most of 'B' and 'Support' Companies headed towards Wolfheze while the rest of the battalion headed towards Oosterbeek, the two parts of the battalion were never reunited. The units in Wolfheze and the remnants of the 10th Parachute Battalion now prepared to defend the village.|$|E

500|$|While {{recognized}} {{primarily as}} a playmaker leading up to his NHL career, Kariya was forced into shooting more as the Mighty Ducks lacked scorers {{in his first two}} seasons with the team. During his third NHL season, he commented that, [...] "If Teemu [...] <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>here</b> right off the bat, then maybe I wouldn't have focused so much on shooting." [...] Kariya was able to put many shots on goal due to his quick release. In 1998–99, he led the League with 429 shots on goal, which at the time was the second-highest recorded total in NHL history. Nonetheless maintaining his passing ability, Kariya was particularly adept at making plays from deep in the offensive zone and beside the opposing team's net.|$|E
500|$|Two {{weeks later}} in the Super Bowl, the Falcons played the Broncos, the game pitting coach Dan Reeves against his former team and their star quarterback, John Elway. Reeves had led the Broncos to three Super Bowl appearances, all losses, and he was fired as the Broncos' head coach after the 1992 NFL season. Afterward, Elway was quoted as saying, [...] "These last three years have been hell. I know I {{would not have been}} back here if Dan Reeves <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>here.</b> It wasn't worth it to me. I didn't enjoy it. It wasn't any fun, and I got tired of working with him." [...] Reeves responded by saying, [...] "Just tell him it wasn't exactly heaven for me either. One of these days I hope he grows up. Maybe he'll mature sometime." [...] During his tenure, Reeves had also fired Shanahan, who was an {{assistant}} coach on the team, and these points of contention became a media storyline entering the game. Nonetheless, all parties involved stated that any lingering animosity had long since passed.|$|E
500|$|Lawrence Brown wrote: [...] "Spielberg's {{decision}} {{to present the}} invaders' fighting machines as having been there all along, buried deep under the Earth, raises questions which {{did not exist in}} the original Wells book. In Spielberg's version, these invaders <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>here</b> before, long ago, in prehistoric times. They had set up their machines deep underground, and departed. Why? Why not take over the Earth right there and then? Spielberg does not provide an answer, and the characters are too busy surviving to wonder about this. An answer suggests itself - a very chilling answer. The invaders were interested in humans as food animals. When they came here before, humans were very scarce. The aliens left their hidden machines and departed, patiently observing the Earth until humans would multiply to the requisite numbers - and then they came back, to take over. Under this interpretation, all of us - all humans over the whole of history - have been livestock living in an alien food farm, destined to be 'harvested'".|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} of the Maharishi's death in 2008, more than 5 million people had learned Transcendental Meditation, and his {{worldwide}} movement was valued in the billions of dollars. The ashram, built on land belonging to the Rajaji National Park, was reclaimed by the government in the mid-1990s after the lease expired in 1981, and fell into disrepair. After the Maharishi died, McCartney said: [...] "my memories of him will only be joyful ones. He was a great man who worked tirelessly {{for the people of the}} world and the cause of unity". Starr said in 2008, [...] "I feel so blessed I met the Maharishi– he gave me a mantra that no one can take away, and I still use it". In 2009, McCartney, Starr, Donovan, and Horn reunited at a concert held at New York's Radio City Music Hall to benefit the David Lynch Foundation, which funds the teaching of Transcendental Meditation in schools. A 2008 article in Rolling Stone magazine reported Yoko Ono as saying: [...] "John would have been the first one now, if he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>here,</b> to recognize and acknowledge what Maharishi has done for the world and appreciate it". Author Gary Tillery wrote in 2010 that Lennon [...] "benefited from the experience" [...] and [...] "for the rest of his life he often turned to meditation to restore himself and improve his creativity." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{deciding}} Game 7 of the 2015 Finals {{was scheduled}} to be played at 7:00 PM on April 30, 2015 at the WFCU Centre in Windsor, Ontario. The Express shootaround was set to take place before that of the Rainmen. The road team was supposed to arrive for warm-ups at approximately 1:00 PM, but entered the stadium approximately two hours earlier. Express assistant coach Gerry Brumpton recounted, [...] "They snuck in here before they even had the light on. We were here in the dark, I opened up the curtain and I looked in and there they were. They were still here working out. So they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>here</b> for a while." [...] The Express told their opponents to leave the arena, but they refused, with one Rainmen player dunking a basketball instead. Windsor's Bill Jones then attempted to take a ball from Halifax center Liam McMorrow, but the player [...] "flinched," [...] pretending to throw a punch. According to Rainmen player Forrest Fisher, Jones tackled McMorrow to the ground and Express guard Tony Bennett followed up by hitting McMorrow with a chair. Referring to the Rainmen, Jones said, [...] "A couple of them kicked me and tried to take swings at me. And my players were there and they came to my rescue {{to be able to get}} me up." [...] Soon the violence escalated, with staff members and players from both teams involved. At around 10:40 AM, Windsor police received a phone call [...] "that between 15 to 20 men were involved in an altercation." [...] By the time they arrived at the WFCU Centre, however, the fighting was over and the Rainmen players had already reached their team bus.|$|E

[...] At Brives, their commanding officer, le Médecin Capitaine Jean Gosset, managed to send a telegram to warn the British Embassy at Bordeaux that the unit was splitting up, and that the 26 women would be continuing alone.

2500|$|Probably {{the major}} issue troubling American {{archaeology}} {{over the last}} several decades has been establishing when the first humans arrived in the western hemisphere. [...] For nearly half a century the very large majority of working archaeologists adhered to the notion that people making and using the very distinctive Clovis [...] "point" [...] and its associated lithic technology were the first to arrive about 13,500 calendar years ago and to have spread quickly throughout the Americas. [...] However, there was always a small archaeological minority who contended that the first Americans (in the broadest, two-continent, sense) <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>here</b> long before Clovis times on both the east and west margins of both continents. [...] In the last several decades, with the location, investigation, and reporting {{of a growing number of}} sites with reliable dating, more and more American archaeologists now believe the western hemisphere was occupied at least several thousand years prior to the appearance of diagnostic Clovis materials.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1859, he was {{appointed}} as Superintendent at the federal armory in Harpers Ferry, Virginia (now West Virginia). He served there until the American Civil War began in 1861. In October 1859, abolitionist John Brown raided the arsenal. Brown's raiders captured the entire armory and town, which Brown knew to be minimally guarded by civilians, although ultimately he failed and was captured because he remained in town too long. Recent research questions whether Brown really attempted to steal the weapons to support a slave rebellion, considering that explanation Virginia slaveholder propaganda. [...] Barbour wrote that he was visiting the federal armory at Springfield, Massachusetts. [...] "Had I been here, I could have done no good. Old Brown would have taken Gen.

2500|$|In {{the account}} of the raising of Lazarus, Jesus meets with the sisters in turn: Martha {{followed}} by Mary. Martha goes immediately to meet Jesus as he arrives, while Mary waits until she is called. As one commentator notes, [...] "Martha, the more aggressive sister, went to meet Jesus, while quiet and contemplative Mary stayed home. This portrayal of the sisters agrees with that found in Luke 10:38–42." [...] When Mary meets Jesus, she falls at his feet. In speaking with Jesus, both sisters lament that he did not arrive in time to prevent their brother's death: [...] "Lord, if you <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>here,</b> my brother would not have died." [...] But where Jesus' response to Martha is one of teaching calling her to hope and faith, his response to Mary is more emotional: [...] "When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled. As the 17th century Welsh commentator Matthew Henry notes, [...] "Mary added no more, as Martha did; but it appears, by what follows, that what she fell short in words she made up in tears; she said less than Martha, but wept more." ...|$|E
