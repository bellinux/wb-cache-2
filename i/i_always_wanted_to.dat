5|$|I am {{excited to}} give my Australian fans the World Premiere of 'Love On Top'! Thank you for the amazing {{response}} to the song at radio. I have worked very hard on this video, this song is special to me and I had an idea for the video based on {{some of my favorite}} male groups. I remember seeing videos from New Edition, The Jackson 5 and the Temptations, bands I love for their beautiful harmonies, and precise choreography and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make a video and be part of a boy group myself. It was so much fun. I put my heart and soul into 'Love On Top' and I hope you love it.|$|E

In an interview with Time magazine, Rodgers explained: [...] "I went to the club to see another woman sing, but when I got there Madonna was onstage. I loved her stage presence and then we met right after that. I kept thinking to myself, 'Damn, is she a star', but she wasn't at that time. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> work with her and Like a Virgin seemed like a perfect opportunity." ...|$|E

I woke {{up a lot}} and couldn't breathe, and {{had to go to}} the hospital in the middle of the night. It kind of held me back from athletics. I still have it, but I control it. Now I use an atomizer or an inhaler. When I was younger, I used this breathing machine… I hated that thing. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> run around and be active." ...|$|E

500|$|Alston {{commented on}} his approach, saying, [...] "I never criticized a player for a mistake on the spot. Whenever I got steamed up about something, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> sleep {{on it and}} face the {{situation}} with a clear head." [...] Sportswriter Jim Murray said that Alston was [...] "the only guy in the game who could look Billy Graham right in the face without blushing and who would order {{corn on the cob}} in a Paris restaurant."

500|$|Volk {{enrolled}} at the University of Michigan in 1963. His decision to attend Michigan rather than Ohio State was influenced by family ties, including Bob Chappuis, who was Volk's uncle and {{finished second in the}} Heisman Trophy voting while playing for the undefeated 1947 Wolverines. Volk noted:"I had all these stories growing up. He [...] was my hero, so <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> go to Michigan. ... And I didn't like Woody [...] anyway. It was just my Grandpa telling me because he didn't like Woody, and he hoped Woody would choke on his Thanksgiving turkey. ... Because of Uncle Bob going to Michigan, that's where I wanted to go. You know, I loved the helmets, loved the uniforms. I said 'Hey, if I could just sit on the bench, that's all I care about.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Robinson also {{competed for}} the Michigan men's {{track and field}} team during his {{freshman}} year. In January 2010, Robinson told a reporter, [...] "When I was getting recruited <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> run track and play football. It helped me move faster on the football field." [...] Michigan track coach Fred LaPlante said Robinson {{had one of the}} 10 fastest 100-meter high-school times in the United States in 2009 and described Robinson the sprinter as [...] "one of the four or five best guys in the Big Ten." [...] LaPlante emphasized Robinson's [...] "quickness":"One thing in football that you don't see in track is quickness. He's incredibly quick and his lateral movement is unbelievable and his ability to go in one direction and get in another. The perception people have is that's speed. That's not speed, that's quickness." ...|$|E

500|$|In April, Farmer played {{shooting}} guard for the North {{team in the}} Kentucky Derby Festival Classic. He scored 14 points on 5 of 12 shooting and grabbed 3 rebounds, but his team lost to the South team 134125. Among his teammates in the Classic was Kentucky signee Sean Woods, who told the Lexington Herald-Leader that he and Farmer had become good friends and that he hoped Farmer would choose {{to play for the}} Wildcats. The paper also reported that Farmer had narrowed his list of potential college choices to three: Western Kentucky, LSU, and Kentucky. Farmer took an official visit to Western Kentucky the weekend of April 9, 1988, but on April 14, {{the second day of the}} April signing period, he held a press conference at his high school gymnasium to announce that he had signed a National Letter of Intent with Kentucky. He told the assembled crowd, [...] " [...] been a dream of mine as long as I can remember. Even before kindergarten, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> play for Kentucky." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1983, Baker {{published}} an autobiography titled Baby Doll: An Autobiography, which detailed {{her life and}} career as an actress and revealed the issues with Paramount and Warner Bros. that had led her to move to Europe in the 1970s and pursue a career in Italian films. Baker said to Regis Philbin, when he interviewed her for Lifetime Television in 1986, that she [...] "didn't want to write an autobiography... but I wanted to write, and I knew {{that would be the}} easiest thing to get published." [...] She further commented to Philbin on her writing, saying: [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> write, but I was a little self-conscious about it. I never had a formal education, and I've always had such a respect for writing. While I could go out and say, even before I started to act, 'Yes, I'm an actress,' I couldn't really say 'I'm a writer.'" [...] In spite of Baker's misgivings, Baby Doll: An Autobiography was well received. She later wrote two other books, To Africa with Love (1986), detailing her time spent in Africa, and a novel titled A Roman Tale (1987).|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} for Complex, Drake stated that his debut album will be [...] "a solid hip hop album" [...] and musically distinct from his So Far Gone mixtape, which received negative comparisons to Kanye West's 808s & Heartbreak (2008). He {{expressed a desire to}} work with André 3000, Kid Cudi, and Sade for the album. In {{an interview}} for MTV, Drake cited Nas and André 3000 as influences for parts of Thank Me Later, stating [...] "Nas was somebody that I used to listen to his raps and never understood how he did it. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> understand how he painted those pictures and his bar structure. I went back and really studied Nas and André 3000 and then came back with this album". In comparing the album to his previous work, he stated [...] "It's gonna be bigger, it's gonna sound happier. More victorious, 'cause that's where I'm at in my life". He told Entertainment Weekly that, [...] "I didn't make this album for commercial purposes. A lot of the verses are extremely long. I just made it to share with people. I hope they can enjoy".|$|E

5000|$|In {{explaining}} her approach, Lygia Pape said: My {{concern is}} <b>always</b> invention. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> invent {{a new language}} that's different {{for me and for}} others, too...

500|$|Two {{versions}} of the song are present on the album; the English-language version features vocals from English rapper Dizzee Rascal (who also wrote the lyrics of his parts), while the Spanish-language version features El Cata. Speaking about the collaboration, Dizzee Rascal said that [...] "I know it sounds a bit mad now, but you'll see it and see what's going on". He further said [...] "It's me doing something different man, on a merengue tip." [...] In an interview with Billboard, Dizzee Rascal said about Shakira that, [...] "she's {{a bit of a}} trendsetter -- she does loads of different things on a major scale" [...] and added [...] "You'd expect her to use an American rapper , but she chose me. It meant a lot." [...] He then commented about the song that, [...] "I'd like to be in that Spanish market. I got into the whole reggaeton thing when it came out, so <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> get around to something like that". [...] "Loca" [...] served as the lead single from Sale el Sol. The Spanish version of the song, featuring El Cata, was released on 10 September 2010. The English version, featuring Dizzee Rascal, debuted later on 13 September 2010.|$|E
500|$|Trailing the Minnesota Vikings 20–19 with 72 {{seconds left}} in the fourth quarter at the Metrodome in week 11, Phil Simms {{completed}} a desperate 22-yard pass on fourth and 17 to Bobby Johnson for a first down. The completion led to Raul Allegre's fifth field goal and an important Giants victory 22–20. In the Giants' three previous games, Simms had completed only six passes to wide receivers. In the Giants' victory he completed eight to wide receivers, four to tight end Mark Bavaro and 13 to his running backs—four to Ottis Anderson in the final two drives, three to Maurice Carthon, three to Joe Morris and three to Tony Galbreath. Simms commented years later, [...] "t's my favorite game in my career, because it's everything <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be as a player. I wanted to be tough, making big throws, immune to pressure, not worried about outcomes. It was truly like standing on the tee box in golf and there's trees on each side and water and you just go 'Man, I'm gonna rip it down the middle.' And no other thought crosses your mind." [...] The game has frequently been credited as a signature game of their season, and the Giants players celebrated the victory in the tunnel leading to their locker room and in the locker room itself in a raucous manner that was highly atypical for the team. [...] "They high-fived themselves silly", recalled Peter King. [...] "They were screaming and hooting and raising hell—happier than they had been all year." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Stefani {{modified}} her image, {{inspired by}} that of Michelle Pfeiffer's character Elvira Hancock in the 1983 film Scarface. The reinvented image included a symbol consisting of two back-to-back 'G's, which appears on a diamond-encrusted key she wears on a necklace and which became a motif in the promotion of The Sweet Escape. Stefani raised concerns in January 2007 about her rapid weight loss following her pregnancy. She later stated {{that she had been}} on a diet since the sixth grade to fit in size 4 clothing, commenting, [...] "It's an ongoing battle and it's a nightmare. But I like clothes too much, and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> wear the outfits I would make." [...] A wax figure of Stefani was unveiled at Madame Tussauds Las Vegas at The Venetian on September 22, 2010. The release of Stefani's first solo album brought attention to her entourage of four Harajuku Girls, who appear in outfits influenced by Gothic Lolita fashion, and are named for the area around the Harajuku Station of Tokyo, Japan. Stefani's clothing also took influence from Japanese fashion, in a style described as a combination between Christian Dior and Japan. The dancers are featured in her music videos, press coverage, and on the album cover for Love. Angel. Music. Baby., with a song named for and dedicated to them on the album. They were also featured in, and the namesake for, Stefani's Harajuku Lovers Tour. Forbes magazine reported Stefani's earnings in 2008, calculating that she earned $27million between June 2007 to June 2008 for her tour, fashion line and commercials, making her the world's 10th highest paid music personality at the time.|$|E

2500|$|The English indie {{rock band}} the Cribs was also {{influenced}} by the Bee Gees. Cribs member Ryan Jarman said: [...] "It must have had quite a big influence on us – pop melodies is something we <b>always</b> revert <b>to.</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get back to pop melodies and I'm sure that's due to that Bee Gees phase we went through".|$|R

500|$|Tatiana {{fell in love}} on {{at least}} one occasion. In an article in the December 2004 edition of the {{magazine}} Royalty Digest: A Journal of Record Peter de Malama wrote that his cousin, Dmitri Yakovlevich Malama, an officer in the Imperial Russian Cavalry, met Tatiana when he was wounded in 1914 and a romance later developed between Tatiana and the young man when he was appointed an equerry to the court of the Tsar at Tsarskoye Selo. Dmitri Malama gave Tatiana a French bulldog she named [...] "Ortipo" [...] in September 1914. [...] "Forgive me about the little dog," [...] Tatiana wrote to her mother on 30 September 1914. [...] "To say the truth, when he asked should I like to have it if he gave it to me, I at once said yes. You remember, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> have one, and only afterwards when we came home I thought that suddenly you might not like me having one. But I really was so pleased at the idea that I forgot about everything." [...] The dog died, but Malama gave her a replacement puppy. Tatiana took it with her to Yekaterinburg, where it died {{with the rest of the}} family. Malama paid the imperial family a visit some eighteen months after he gave Tatiana the first dog. [...] "My little Malama came for an hour yesterday evening," [...] wrote Alexandra to Nicholas on 17 March 1916. [...] "...Looks flourishing more of a man now, an adorable boy still. I must say a perfect son in law he w(ou)ld have been – why are foreign P(rin)ces not as nice!" [...] Malama was killed in August 1919 while commanding a unit of the White Russians fighting the civil war against the Bolsheviks in the Ukraine, according to Peter de Malama.|$|E
