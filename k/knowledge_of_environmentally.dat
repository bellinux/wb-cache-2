40|$|The {{environmental}} invariants hypothesis {{suggests that}} (a) mental representations automatically extrapolate effects of invariant physical principles on the referent physical objects, and (b) {{the results of}} this extrapolation distort spatial memory. The extrapolations preserve a second-order isomorphism between the dynamics and kinematics of physical objects and the mental representations of those objects, and such an isomorphism has implications for theories of cognitive structure and processing across a variety of domains. The remembered position of a target is usually displaced from the actual position of that target, and the pattern of displacement is often consistent with the operation of invariant physical principles on that target (for review, see Hubbard, 1995 b). For example, an observer’s memory for the final location of a horizontally moving target is displaced forward and downward, and this pattern is consistent with the operation of momentum and gravity on such a target. Several different types of displacement in spatial memory have been documented, and these displacements may reflect nonconscious or implicit <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>environmentally</b> invariant physical principles that has been incorporated into the functional architecture of the representational system (Hubbard, 1998 a) ...|$|E
30|$|According to Seckler (2005) and Crane (2007), college {{students}} spend about $ 6 billion annually on {{clothing and footwear}} in the US, accounting for 10  % of their total purchases. Although consumers under 25  years make 53.9 percent less income compared to the average annual income of older consumers, {{college students}} spent a significant higher proportion of their income for apparel products and services than did the older consumers (Boston Consulting Group 2012; Bureau of Labor Statistics 2013). Furthermore, early study by Ward (1974) reported that consumer behavior in terms of skills, knowledge and attitudes learn from their parents and friends, which result significant influence on decision making of young consumers (Lachance et al. 2003; Garrison and Gutter 2010). Similarly, Yan and Chang (2008) placed an importance of college students’ consumer socialization because classes and student organization memberships could possibly change college students’ views {{of the environment and}} <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>environmentally</b> friendly actions. Besides, the younger generation {{has been shown to be}} receptive to the influence of business stewardship in their purchase decisions. They tend to switch from one brand to another, if the other brand is associated with a good cause (Cone Communications 2008). Our study specifically designed to explore sustainable lifestyle, values, and awareness of stewardship among college students.|$|E
40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} differential importance of environmental criteria on product labels as judged by consumers in relation to socio-demographic factors. Five product categories and thirteen criteria were used in this study. Characterizing the `ecologically concerned consumer' may be helpful in developing market segmentation strategies. Findings from this study may provide <b>knowledge</b> about predictors <b>of</b> <b>environmentally</b> responsible consumption behavior. Such research may guide environmental labeling efforts to reduce environmental burdens of consumption. In this study consumers differentially endorsed ecolabel criteria. Further, differential importance was significant for gender, ethnicity, and income. Research is needed to explore the relationships between respondent demographics and eco-label criteria importance. It is necessary to consider importance of criteria to consumers. Without consumer interest, eco-labeling schemes are doomed to fail. Thus, {{it is recommended that}} ecolabeling schemes consider the importance of eco-label criteria, particularly, criteria related to social welfare.

40|$|Despite recent advances, seismic {{design of}} solid waste {{containment}} facilities must still be regarded as an emerging field of practice. However, sufficient data is available to provide a framework <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> for <b>environmentally</b> protective design. Observations of performance in earthquakes show that solid waste landfills can sustain very strong shaking with limited damage and without a harmful discharge of contaminants. The excellent record of seismic performance of landfills is tempered by limited experience with geosynthetic containment systems. The potential for amplification of ground motions by the waste mass and the low yield acceleration often associated with geosynthetic cover systems indicate that attention is warranted to this issue. The limited data from regions outside of California, limited experience with saturated waste, and evolutionary changes in waste streams and waste disposal practices provide continuing challenges to engineers designing solid waste disposal facilities subject to seismic loading...|$|R
30|$|Based on a {{theoretical}} investigation {{of values and}} lifestyle concepts beyond demographic and socio-economic characteristics, Mitchell (1983) describes consumer behavior variation {{in terms of the}} Values and Lifestyles Scale (VALS). In line with the VALS perspective (Mitchell 1983), this study develops the “Sustainable VALS framework” by incorporating into it business stewardship efforts on the part of corporations. First, sustainable VALS makes the notion of sustainable value, which consists of social value and environmental value (Nordlund and Garvil 2002; Stern et al. 1993). Sustainable values are clearly held by committed environmentalists who hold values emphasizing social unity more than personal wealth (Barr and Gilg 2006). Second, lifestyle scale is extended to six practice domains in line with activities, interests, and opinion of fashion product consumption. Third, business stewardship is specified emphasizing the business effort for CSR drives and eco-label/index. Lastly, our study specifically aimed to explore sustainable lifestyle, values, and awareness of stewardship among college students because college students spend about $ 6 billion annually on clothing and footwear in the US, accounting for 10  % of their total purchases (Seckler 2005; Crane 2007). Furthermore, Yan and Chang (2008) placed an importance of college students’ consumer socialization because classes and student organization memberships could possibly change college students’ views of the environment and <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>environmentally</b> friendly actions.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the decades}} {{the concept of}} green {{consumption}} has been discussed with sustainable consumption, green behavior, eco-citizenship and sustainable patterns and lifestyles. Various environmental problems like global warming, pollution, shortage {{of natural resources and}} climate change threatened the sustainability of the environment and our survival. There is an increasing demand from scholars and society for the change of human behavior to help reduce the environmental impact. This study aims to investigate how supermarket influences the daily consumption in a sustainable way through the concept of green marketing in terms of green product management, green packaging, green promotion, green pricing, green logistics and green labeling. That means, a supermarket is not only a place to provide green products but also influence the culture of green consumption through the efforts of designing environmentally friendly facilities and strategies. In real life practice, there are constraints and challenges to encourage green consumption in the community. Through literature review, interview and surveys, the study investigates the kinds of products and facilities which have been used in Hong Kong supermarkets and consumers’ perception and <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>environmentally</b> friendly products and services. Through exploration of overseas case studies, insights on common sustainable practices were identified and how overseas’ best practices can be adopted or modified in Hong Kong were discussed. The surveys with Wellcome/Three Sixty/MarketPlace by Jasons and the general public illustrate how supermarket can promote sustainable and green consumption in Hong Kong and the progress of achievement. The study ends with suggestions on how joint-efforts from the various stakeholders in the society can facilitate green consumption. These include public participation, green initiatives of supermarkets, price incentive, promotion and government’s support to encourage pro-environmental behavior. published_or_final_versionEnvironmental ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Environmental Managemen...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate {{the extent to which the}} Life Sciences curriculum integrates green economy content, as functional green economy knowledge amongst South African citizens could address socio-economic challenges in South Africa. Primarily, document analysis of the Grade 10 - 12 Life Sciences Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement (CAPS) was conducted to determine whether green economy content was prescribed in the CAPS document and to what degree. Secondly, Grade 10 Life Sciences teachers completed questionnaires and participated in interviews to reveal their opinions on the integration of green economy content in the Life Sciences curriculum, their understanding of green economy and its implementation, as well as their opinions on the relevance of the current Life Sciences curriculum’s content for afterschool use. 	 The research findings revealed that the Life Sciences curriculum can serve the purpose of introducing students to green economy aspects, however changes must be made to the curriculum so that functional green economy content is integrated. Currently, the curriculum does not provide guidelines for teachers on how to educate learners in such a manner that they will be able to participate in a green economy. Much of the content related to green economy topics is prescribed as extra content without the inclusion of student investigations or skill development activities. Furthermore, content on plants and human anatomy are prescribed and assessed in much greater detail than the environmental studies strand, resulting in the exclusion of much green economy related content. Findings indicate that socioscientific issues such as green economy are not linked to the environmental studies subject content, which means that daily-life application of content remains unclear to students. In addition to this, teachers revealed that they have <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>environmentally</b> green practices but are unsure of how these relate to the economy. The researcher proposes that curriculum designers completely integrate green economy content into the Life Sciences CAPS document, including not only content for discussion purposes but also investigations and activities which will lead to skills development, compelling learners to modify their behaviour and seek solutions to the urgent problems faced by humanity in terms of environmental degradation and economic collapse.

40|$|AbstractSustainable highway {{infrastructure}} design {{requires a}} good balance between environment and cost. The available computer-based automated highway alignment optimization algorithms minimize the total highway alignment cost towards obtaining the optimized alignment. These are primarily single-objective optimization approaches with limited capability in considering various cost components and {{factors that may}} be dissimilar or conflicting in nature. In these approaches, the impacted area <b>of</b> <b>environmentally</b> preserved land is transformed to monetary value and included in the total highway alignment cost. Also, they have limited capability in yielding a set of alternatives with different levels of trade-off between the total highway alignment cost and impacted area <b>of</b> <b>environmentally</b> preserved land. This leads {{to the need for}} developing a model to estimate the impacted area <b>of</b> <b>environmentally</b> preserved land in terms of non-monetary values and use concurrently with total highway alignment cost providing a perspective comparison of highway alignment alternatives. A multiobjective analysis is presented in this paper to consider the impacted area <b>of</b> <b>environmentally</b> preserved land information expressed in non-monetary unit and total highway alignment cost expressed in monetary unit. In this analysis, a genetic algorithm (GA) based multiobjective optimization technique is adopted. The paper describes a special algorithm developed to estimate the impacted area <b>of</b> <b>environmentally</b> preserved land from a Geographic Information System (GIS) based study area map and simultaneous minimization of impacted area <b>of</b> <b>environmentally</b> preserved land and highway alignment cost. A Pareto-optimal front is used to graphically represent the trade-off values of highway alignment cost and impacted area <b>of</b> <b>environmentally</b> preserved land. Finally, the developed methodology is applied to a study area and results are compared with the available single objective highway alignment optimization model output...|$|R
