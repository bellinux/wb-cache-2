50|$|In 1851 Ray was {{a member}} of the {{executive}} committee of the newly organized Wisconsin State Agricultural Society. He served as a judge in two categories of the first Wisconsin State Fair: Merinoes, and flour and corn meal; and took several prizes in farm implements: best hay fork, manure fork, grass scythe, grain scythe, and <b>hay</b> <b>knife.</b>|$|E
50|$|After hay was cut and had dried, the hay was raked or rowed up by raking it into {{a linear}} heap by hand or with a horse-drawn implement. Turning hay, when needed, {{originally}} was done by hand with a fork or rake. Once the dried hay was rowed up, pitch forks were used to pile it loose, originally onto a horse-drawn cart or wagon, later onto a truck or tractor-drawn trailer, for which a sweep could be used instead of pitch forks.Loose hay was taken to an area designated for storage—usually a slightly raised area for drainage—and built into a hay stack. The stack was made waterproof as it was built (a skilled task) and the hay would compress under its own weight and cure by the release of heat from the residual moisture in the hay and from the compression forces. The stack was fenced {{from the rest of}} the paddock in a rick yard, and often thatched or sheeted to keep it dry. When needed, slices of hay would be cut using a <b>hay</b> <b>knife</b> and fed out to animals each day.|$|E

25|$|There {{was only}} one place, about {{one-half}} mile upstream {{from the mouth of}} the river, where Winema might be turned, and in the process, Winema became wedged sideways between the river banks. It became necessary to excavate a bay in the bank of the river, using <b>hay</b> <b>knives</b> and cross-cut saws to cut the sod, before Winema could be turned. This took almost 3 full days.|$|R
6000|$|In a {{few minutes}} Manners returned. I thought he glanced oddly at Tom, who was still {{lingering}} in attendance, and I even fancied he talked to us ostentatiously for his benefit. [...] "Yes, it was a row of Tournelli's. He {{was waiting at the}} corner; had rushed at <b>Hays</b> with a <b>knife,</b> but had been met with a derringer-shot through his hat. The lady, who, it seems, was only a chance steamer acquaintance of Hays', thought the attack must have been meant for HER, as she had recognized in the Italian a man who had stolen from her divorced husband in the States, two years ago, and was a fugitive from justice. At least that was the explanation given by Hays, for the woman had fainted and been driven off to her hotel by the Quartermaster, and Tournelli had escaped. But the Editor was on his track. You didn't notice that lady, Tom, did you?" ...|$|R
