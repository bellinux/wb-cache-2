500|$|Miles sarcastically nicknames his acquaintances, {{prompting}} critics, {{fans and}} characters to compare {{him to the}} character Sawyer {{and give him a}} nickname of his own: [...] "mini-Sawyer". [...] Ken Leung claims that he is often approached by people who like the character and he assumes that it is because of Miles's [...] "sardonic wit" [...] and [...] " [...] sort of attitude." [...] Leung surmised that [...] "Usually when people are like that, just … kind of throwing off quick [...] quirky remarks … they're hiding something, so he's definitely hiding something." [...] Asked if Miles is much like him, Leung responded with [...] "I don't think I'm that similar. [...] Um, I don't know—I guess I have moments." [...] Leung said that [...] "Miles doesn't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> social, which is great, because I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> social." [...] He has also stated that Miles [...] "trust the dead more than the living" [...] and is intrigued as to whom Miles grieves for. [...] Leung stated that [...] "He seems haunted by something, that—that's for sure … one of the first thoughts I had [...] communication with the dead … can't be a great thing … it's not a happy skill to have." ...|$|E
500|$|In May 2011, it was {{revealed}} that Susan and Karl's marriage would be run into trouble, when Susan becomes emotionally involved with another man. Susan strikes up a friendship with local builder, Jim Dolan (Scott Parmeter), as he fights cancer, causing problems between herself and Karl. When asked by Channel 5 about her reaction to the storyline, Woodburne said [...] "I think it's a great story. Karl and Susan are both in their 50s; they've been married together; they've raised a bunch of kids; they’ve had careers and jobs. And to use the popular term 'empty nesters', that's what they’re looking at. For him he thinks, 'That's great, terrific! More time for us; we can travel.' But for her it's, 'Well, I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> that person. I <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> this person, who's someone who's wrangling kids and busy doing things.' But her challenge I {{think is going to be}} to find out who she is as one half of a couple, as opposed to being the hub of a wheel." [...] The actress revealed she and Fletcher were both worried about Susan and Karl breaking up and having to work with new people, but they believe any new development for the characters is good. Woodburne told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that she thought the new storyline was great and said any relationship which has been going for as long as the Kennedys' has, will have its [...] "turbulent patches". Woodburne said Susan develops a very strong attachment to Jim because of her desire to help and be needed. When asked if she was worried about revisiting old ground with the storyline, Woodburne said the new conflict, which arises within Karl and Susan's relationship, is [...] "very appropriate" [...] for the time of their lives and where they are at.|$|E
500|$|While {{casting the}} [...] "freighter folk"– the {{nickname}} that Losts executive producers/writers/show runners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse use {{to refer to}} Daniel, Charlotte, Miles and Frank– fake names, occupations and scenes were temporarily assigned, to limit the leak of spoilers. [...] After seeing Ken Leung guest star on HBO's The Sopranos in April 2007, Lindelof and Cuse wrote the role of Miles specifically for him, although it was initially reported that Leung would be playing the part of [...] "brilliant mathematician" [...] "Russell". [...] The name Miles Straume was simply chosen because the writer-producers thought that [...] "it would be cool if his name sounded like 'maelstrom. [...] Had he not taken the part, Lindelof and Cuse claim that Miles would have been scrapped and a new and very different character would have been written into the story instead. [...] Leung, who was originally contracted as a recurring guest star, {{was quoted as saying}} that [...] "Miles doesn't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> social, which is great, because I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> social." [...] Costume designer Roland Sanchez wanted to base one of the freighter folk's clothing after that of Keith Richards, specifically a picture in which he wore a sleeveless vest, which he admired. [...] Sanchez believed that Miles fitted the haggard look and bought an Armani Exchange jacket, cut off the sleeves and added a hood, and that this outfit helped Leung to develop Miles. [...] Co-executive producer/writer Edward Kitsis had been pitching the name [...] "Lapidus" [...] for years, finally naming an unseen character in the fourteenth episode of the third season Rick Lapidus. [...] Unsatisfied, Kitsis developed the character [...] "Frank Lapidus, Helicopter Pilot". [...] According to the show runners, recurring guest star Jeff Fahey [...] "was the first and only choice for the role". [...] They also commended his [...] "intense eyes" [...] and stated that [...] "he has exactly the right sensibilities" [...] for the part. [...] Frank was not envisioned with a beard, however, the writer-producers allowed Fahey to keep it for the role. [...] The writer-producers have said that Frank [...] "never takes anything at face value [...] a true conspiracy nut [...] has probably seen every episode of The X-Files, [...] pay off for him".|$|E
