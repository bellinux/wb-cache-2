This dynamic intervention activity of traders will significantly alter the Hungarian trade sector by bringing it closer to the physical processes of the cereal chain.

Recent research suggests that {{only a limited number}} of individuals who are <b>eligible</b> <b>for</b> <b>intervention</b> are actually receiving such services. This thesis first discusses the current evidence-base for interventions aimed at young children with ASD.

Two large-scale experimental school-based studies are then presented which examine the effects of an ABA-based high-intensity physical exercise as an effective intervention for children with ASD and other Special Educational Needs (SEN). In one study, this intervention is compared with a low-intensity exercise program. Results indicate that high-intensity physical exercise results in significant short-term (0 -to- 90 minute), but not long-term (24 hours+), improvements in cognitive/behavioral flexibility (executive functions) in students with ASD and students with SEN. Furthermore, both high-intensity and low-intensity exercise resulted in significant reductions in stress, in both the short-term and long-term in students with ASD and students with SEN. These findings provide direct evidence for the effectiveness of physical exercise as a school-based intervention...|$|E

The reliability of the new screening instrument was established by using the test-retest and interrater methods.

Summary of Review—Begun in April 2007 with 3 centers, the trial has grown to 65 centers, and has randomized 124 patients through mid-June 2010 en route to the planned 400. The current literature continues to support the rationale for the trial. Conclusions—ARUBA is steadily approaching its monthly randomization goals and has already reached the number needed to test the maximum published interventional complication rates against the minimum hemorrhage rates for natural history. (Stroke. 2010; 41 :e 537 -e 540.) Key Words: arteriovenous malformations endovascular treatment neuroradiology neurosurgery radiotherapy randomized controlled trials A randomized trial of unruptured brain arteriovenousmalformations (ARUBA–U 01 NS 051483) was funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders with a pragmatic, simple plan: to determine for those brain arterio-venous malformations (BAVMs) discovered without having bled, whether prophylactic intervention (endovascular, surgi-cal, and radiotherapy, alone or in combination) or deferral of intervention unless hemorrhage occurred would prove supe-rior as tested by the outcomes of death, stroke, or functional outcomes status (measured by the modified Rankin Scale) at a minimum of 5 years from randomization. Both groups are treated medically for the common symptoms of headaches, seizures, or coexisting other medical conditions. Eligibility is limited to patients with a brain arteriovenous malformation that has not bled and is deemed suitable for attempted eradication based on the judgment and expertise of the local clinical site investigators.

40|$|Relapse of {{pediatric}} acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains {{the main cause}} of treatment failure after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). A high level of minimal residual disease (MRD) before alloSCT has been shown to predict these relapses. Patients at risk might benefit from a preemptive alloimmune intervention. In this first prospective, MRD-guided intervention study, 48 patients were stratified according to pre-SCT MRD level. Eighteen children with MRD level {{greater than or equal to}} 1 × 10 − 4 were <b>eligible</b> <b>for</b> <b>intervention,</b> consisting of early cyclosporine A tapering followed by consecutive, incremental donor lymphocyte infusions (n= 1 – 4). The intervention was associated with graft versus host disease greater than or equal tograde II in only 23 % of patients. Event-free survival in the intervention group was 19 %. However, in contrast with the usual early recurrence of leukemia, relapses were delayed up to 3 years after SCT. In addition, several relapses presented at unusual extramedullary sites suggesting that the immune intervention may have altered the pattern of leukemia recurrence. In 8 out of 11 evaluable patients, relapse was preceded by MRD recurrence (median 9 weeks, range 0 – 30). We conclude that in children with high-risk ALL, immunotherapy-based regimens after SCT are feasible and may need to be further intensified to achieve total eradication of residual leukemic cells. A.
