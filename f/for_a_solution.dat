5|$|He waited <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> to {{be offered}} in three issues, over six months, but failed to receive any. At the end, Ramanujan {{supplied}} {{the solution to the}} problem himself. On page 105 of his first notebook, he formulated an equation {{that could be used to}} solve the infinitely nested radicals problem.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter Myrrha {{walked in}} exile for nine months, past {{the palms of}} Arabia and the fields of Panchaea, until she reached Sabaea. Afraid of death and tired of life, and {{pregnant}} as well, she begged the gods <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>solution,</b> and was transformed into the myrrh tree, with the sap thereof representing her tears. Later, Lucina freed the newborn Adonis from the tree.|$|E

5|$|In December 1523, {{the council}} set a {{deadline}} of Pentecost in 1524 <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> to {{the elimination of}} the mass and images. Zwingli gave a formal opinion in Vorschlag wegen der Bilder und der Messe (Proposal Concerning Images and the Mass). He did not urge an immediate, general abolition. The council decided on the orderly removal of images within Zurich, but rural congregations were granted the right to remove them based on majority vote. The decision on the mass was postponed.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{distinct}} solutions {{can also be}} identified with Burnside's Lemma. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>solution,</b> the set of equivalent solutions which can be reached using these operations (excluding relabeling), form an orbit of the symmetric group. The number of essentially different solutions is then the number of orbits, which can be computed using Burnside's lemma. The Burnside fixed points are solutions that differ only by relabeling. Using this technique, Jarvis/Russell computed the number of essentially different (symmetrically distinct) solutions as 5,472,730,538.|$|E
5|$|Understanding {{that they}} could not hold out against the might of the British Empire indefinitely, Kruger hoped <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> at the {{earliest}} opportunity. The triumvirate wrote to Colley on 12 February that they were prepared to submit to a royal commission. Colley liaised by telegraph with Gladstone's Colonial Secretary Lord Kimberley, then wrote to Kruger on 21 February that if the Boers stopped fighting he would cease hostilities and send commissioners for talks. Kruger received this letter on 28 February and readily accepted, but by now it was too late. Colley had been killed at the Battle of Majuba Hill the day before, another decisive victory for the Boers under Smit. This progressive humiliation of the Imperial forces in South Africa by a ragtag collection of farmers, to paraphrase Meintjes and the historian Ian Castle, stunned the Western world.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{we present}} two {{iterative}} algorithms <b>for</b> approximating <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> of the split feasibility problem on zeros of a sum of monotone operators and fixed points of a finite family of nonexpansive mappings. Weak and strong convergence theorems are proved {{in the framework}} of Hilbert spaces under some mild conditions. We apply the obtained main result for the problem of finding a common zero of the sum of inverse strongly monotone operators and maximal monotone operators, <b>for</b> finding <b>a</b> common zero of a finite family of maximal monotone operators, <b>for</b> finding <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> of multiple sets split common null point problem, and <b>for</b> finding <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> of multiple sets split convex feasibility problem. Some applications of the main results are also provided.|$|R
25|$|We {{have found}} it {{desirable}} to avoid the term 'solution' altogether for the traffic problem is not such much a problem waiting <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> as a social situation requiring {{to be dealt with}} by policies patiently applied over a period and revised {{from time to time in}} light of events.|$|E
25|$|Leopold of Saxe-Coburg {{had been}} {{proposed}} {{at an early}} stage, but had been dropped because of French opposition. The problems caused by the French candidates and the increased international pressure <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> led to his reconsideration. On 22 April, he was finally approached by a Belgian delegation at Marlborough House to officially offer him the throne. Leopold, however, was reluctant to accept.|$|E
25|$|The United Nations Chairman of the Mixed Commission, Colonel Garrison B. Coverdale (US), pressed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> of {{this issue}} {{to be found in}} the Mixed Armistice Commission, in an amicable and UN spirit. After some hesitation, this {{procedure}} was accepted and finally an agreement was reached whereby the Armistice Demarcation Line was changed to place Wadi Fukin under Jordanian authority who, in turn, agreed to transfer of some uninhabited, but fertile territory south of Bethlehem to Israel control.|$|E
30|$|We {{also have}} the {{following}} strong convergence theorem <b>for</b> finding <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> of multiple sets split equilibrium problem.|$|R
30|$|Based on above arguments, {{we propose}} the {{following}} iterative method <b>for</b> approximating <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> to SNVIP (2 a,b).|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} an iterative {{sequence and}} prove a weak convergence theorem <b>for</b> finding <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> of <b>a</b> system of mixed equilibrium {{problems and the}} set of fixed points of a quasi-nonexpansive mapping in Hilbert spaces. Moreover, we apply our result to obtain a weak convergence theorem <b>for</b> finding <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> of <b>a</b> system of mixed equilibrium problems and the set of fixed points of a nonspreading mapping.|$|R
25|$|The 2nd World Forestry Congress was convened at Budapest in 1936. These two {{conferences}} {{have been}} milestones {{in the development}} of international co-operation in forestry. The impetus which they gave has become evident in the ever-growing common effort <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> of the many problems affecting forestry and forest products. The Third Congress was planned for 1940 with the Government of Finland as host. The war, however, intervened and the Congress had to be postponed.|$|E
25|$|Of primary {{importance}} for MTB 345 was {{the acquisition of}} more fuel from hidden depots along the coast. When MTB 345 reached a depot at the island of Ospa near Bergen, she was hidden under camouflage netting. The fuel at Ospa proved {{to be of the}} wrong type for MTB 345s engines, leaving the motor torpedo boat without enough fuel for operations or a return to the Shetland Islands. MTB 345 remained at Ospa waiting <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> to the fuel situation.|$|E
25|$|Dominance is {{a strong}} reason to seek <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> among always-switching strategies, under fairly general {{assumptions}} on {{the environment in which}} the contestant is making decisions. In particular, if the car is hidden by means of some randomization device – like tossing symmetric or asymmetric three-sided die – the dominance implies that a strategy maximizing the probability of winning the car will be among three always-switching strategies, namely it will be the strategy that initially picks the least likely door then switches no matter which door to switch is offered by the host.|$|E

25|$|The pilot episode {{followed}} {{significantly different}} rules {{from the current}} ones. Most noticeably, only eight letters were selected for each letters round. If two contestants offered a word of the same length, or an equally close solution to a numbers game, then only the contestant who made the selection for that round was awarded points. Also, only five points were given for an exact numbers solution, three <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> within 5, and one point for the closer solution, {{no matter how far}} away.|$|E
25|$|The Navier–Stokes {{equations}} {{are also}} {{of great interest}} in a purely mathematical sense. Despite their wide range of practical uses {{it has not yet}} been proven that in three dimensions solutions always exist, or that if they do exist, then they are smooth, i.e. they do not contain any mathematical singularity. These are called the Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness problems. The Clay Mathematics Institute has called this one of the seven most important open problems in mathematics and has offered a US$1,000,000 prize <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> or a counterexample.|$|E
25|$|Martin's strong pro-Tory {{political}} views eventually caused his downfall, {{when he used}} his position in Parliament as member for Plymouth, {{for which he had}} been elected in July 1818, to publicly criticise the new Whig government of Earl Grey in 1830. Infuriated, Grey and Sir James Graham, who had become First Lord of the Admiralty that year, approached Martin's old friend King William IV <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>solution,</b> resulting in Martin's dismissal for insubordination in 1831. In his later years he lived at No. 53 Wimpole Street in London.|$|E
