40|$|I have {{organized}} this paper into two main sections. In the first I will summarize the main empirical findings from {{a research project}} on Coreper’s role in EU decision-making. Drawing {{from a series of}} empirical case studies, I present evidence which supports the existence of a distinct bargaining style in Coreper. In the second, I will extend these findings to a more tentative set of comparisons with the other <b>preparatory</b> <b>bodies</b> within the Council’s infrastructure. This comparison will reveal that the Council’s administrative infrastructure contains a fairly robust level of intra- and interadministrative rivalry-and that of the other EU committees, only the Economic and Finance Committee (formerly the Monetary Committee) approximates the dense norms of interaction, thick trust, and culture of compromise found in Coreper. In a nutshell, this paper is designed to extend a series of findings on Coreper to broader generalizations about decision-making styles in the Council and how different <b>preparatory</b> <b>bodies</b> cooperate and compete in this system...|$|R

The problems identified in practice in a context, moreover, of institutional and economic crisis, call for new approaches.

It acts as a <b>preparatory</b> <b>body</b> for the Conference and reviews {{the implementation of the}} approved programme of work and of the corresponding regular and operational budgets for the forthcoming biennium. Among its other main functions, the Board recommends to the Conference a scale of assessments, as well as a candidate for the post of Director-General.|$|R
50|$|A first {{reference}} of {{the project}} to launch a Black political party {{can be found in}} the October 24, 1935 issue of Nuestra Raza. The following issues of the journal carried more editorials and articles arguing for the foundation of the party. On May 9, 1936 a preliminary assembly of the party was held. Some thirty people participated in the event. Two <b>preparatory</b> <b>bodies</b> were named, a Reporting Committee and a Provisional Board. On May 23, 1936 the manifesto of the party (drafted by the Reporting Committee) was adopted at a party meeting. The manifesto of the party was formulated along Popular Front lines, calling for struggle against fascism and imperialism.|$|R
5000|$|... 1. During the 19th {{meeting of}} the Commission on the Status of Women, acting as <b>preparatory</b> <b>body</b> for the Fourth World Conference on Women, an issue arose {{concerning}} {{the meaning of the}} word [...] "gender" [...] in the context of the Platform for Action of the Conference. In order to examine the matter, the Commission decided to form a contact group in New York, with the Commission's Rapporteur, Ms. Selma Ashipala (Namibia), as Chairperson. The Commission mandated the informal contact group to seek agreement on the commonly understood meaning of [...] "gender" [...] in the context of the Platform for Action and to report directly to the Conference in Beijing.|$|R
5000|$|In 1937, {{the staff}} agency [...] "Chief of the Army" [...] (Chefen för armén, CA) {{was created to}} lead the army in peace time. The CA would under the King in Council {{exercise}} the highest military leadership of the Land Defense (Lantförsvaret). At his side, the CA had an Army Staff to assist the CA in his duties. Before 1937 the Chief of the General Staff {{was considered to be}} the Chief of Army, but he was not usually to the rank of chief, but formally only the king's chief of staff in his capacity as Supreme Commander of the Swedish Armed Forces. The oldest general was chairman of the special <b>preparatory</b> <b>body</b> called the Generals Commission (Generalskommissionen).|$|R
40|$|The {{enlargement}} of the European Union to 25 Member States is having a particularly strong impact {{on the work of}} the Council. It has made it all the more important to streamline and better coordinate the Council’s configurations and <b>preparatory</b> <b>bodies.</b> The increase from 11 to 20 official languages poses unprecedented practical challenges, and {{it remains to be seen}} whether the new linguistic regime will make it possible to cope. New guidelines for the presidency and delegations have been adopted concerning preparation and management of meetings. Other innovations are being explored under the Dutch Presidency. The first months of experience in EU 25 suggest that continuing efforts will be required to ensure that Council business can be managed efficiently and effectively in the coming years...|$|R

40|$|The {{agreements}} signed at the Conference for EU-Related Affairs (CARUE) in November 2004 {{represented an}} attempt to ensure the formal participation of Spain’s autonomous communities in the Council of the EU and its <b>preparatory</b> <b>bodies.</b> The role that the offices and delegations of the autonomous communities play in Brussels in this entire process is fundamental, because in practice they represent {{an important part of}} this participation, even if is not envisaged within the 2004 agreements. However, the diversity of the offices in terms of resources, the current context of economic crises {{and the fact that it}} could allow escape positive secondary effects for the autonomous communities themselves suggest the need to adopt another model of participation, where the offices and delegations would instead be a vehicle to back up the autonomous communities engaged in formal regional participation, rather than the protagonists of the system...|$|R
40|$|Research on the intra-institutional {{consequences}} {{of differences in}} the EU’s inter-institutional rule configurations is rare. This study investigates {{the effect of the}} empowerment of the European Parliament (EP) on the active involvement of ministers in Council decision-making. I argue that the empowerment of the EP increases the incentives for bureaucrats in the Council’s <b>preparatory</b> <b>bodies</b> to refer decisions on legislative dossiers to ministers. The empirical analysis examines this argument with data on more than 6000 legislative decision-making processes that were concluded between 1980 and the end of 2007. The analysis demonstrates a strong and robust association between the type of legislative procedure and different decision-making levels in the Council: a more powerful EP leads to more politicized Council decision-making. In terms of the legitimacy of EU decision-making, this finding implies that empowering the EP does not only create a direct link between EU lawmaker and ordinary citizens, but also contributes to strengthening the indirect link between Council members and their national electorates. * The collection of the data used in {{this research was supported by}} a postdoctoral research grant of the Netherland...|$|R
40|$|It is an {{academic}} truism that enlargement affected {{the functioning of}} the European Union and its institutions, and that effects of enlargement are especially noticeable in the Council and its sub-structures. Many researchers expected procedures in the Council to become more intergovernmental and decision-making to become more complicated. However, enlargement also contributed to institutional change in the Committee of Permanent Representatives in quite another—unexpected—way: it strengthened the influence of supranational and “quasi-supranational” actors within the Council, such as the Commission, the Presidency and the General Secretariat, and it made decision-making considerably easier in cases where profound national interests of the newcomers were not directly concerned. Four institutional mechanisms can be identified that contributed to this unexpected institutional evolution: The mechanism of socialization, the mechanism of specific and unspecific reciprocity, the mechanism of lack of interest and the mechanism of presidential impartiality. These mechanisms helped to overcome the cleavage between old and new as well as to uphold the strong and often cited esprit de corps within the Council and its <b>preparatory</b> <b>bodies.</b> The paper analyzes these processes and tries to answer the question: how did these mechanisms contribute to a kind of supranationalization of the Council and its substructures after the last rounds of enlargement? The analysis is based on 51 semi-structured, intensive interviews with experts from the Council General Secretariat and from member states’ Permanent Representations...|$|R

40|$|The special {{position}} of the rotating Council Presidency has raised a long-standing debate {{on the extent to}} which this function allows a Member State to exert additional influence on European Union decision-making, in particular in external policy. This article argues that a broader and more differentiated study of Presidency influence could further this debate. In doing so, the article analyses the Polish Council Presidency (during the second half of 2011) and its influence on the European Union’s Eastern Partnership policies across three dimensions: (i) differences between influence on the agenda and influence on the contents of decisions, (ii) the forums (different levels in the Council and international forums) where the Presidency can exert influence, and (iii) different types of external policies, an area that has received relatively little scholarly attention thus far in the literature on the Presidency. The analysis shows that (i) the Presidency can determine the agenda to a certain extent, but the {{position of}} the chair does not allow the incumbent to exert additional influence on the contents of decisions; (ii) most Presidency influence of external policies is observed in the <b>preparatory</b> <b>bodies</b> of the Council, while at the ministerial or international level this influence is much smaller; and (iii) although the Presidency can play a rather prominent role in organizing multilateral events, this rarely amounts to real political influence. In turn, the Presidency’s influence is most tangible in specific bilateral dossiers...|$|R

40|$|In a {{competitive}} sport, {{the outcome of}} a game is determined by an athlete's relationship with an unpredictable and uncontrolled opponent. We have previously analyzed the preparatory state of ground reaction forces (GRFs) dividing non-weighted and weighted states (i. e., vertical GRFs below and above 120 % of body weight, respectively) in {{a competitive}} ballgame task and demonstrated that the non-weighted state prevented delay of the defensive step and promoted successful guarding. However, the associated kinetics of lower extremity joints during a competitive sports task remains unknown. The present study aims to investigate the kinetic characteristics of a real-time competitive sport before movement initiation. As a first kinetic study on a competitive sport, we initially compared the successful defensive kinetics with a relatively stable preparatory state and the choice-reaction sidestep as a control movement. Then, we investigated the kinetic cause of the outcome in a 1 -on- 1 dribble in terms of the preparatory states according to our previous study. The results demonstrated that in successful defensive motions in the non-weighted state guarding trial, the times required for the generation of hip abduction and three extension torques for the hip, knee, and ankle joints were significantly shortened compared with the choice-reaction sidestep, and hip abduction and hip extension torques were produced almost simultaneously. The sport-specific movement kinetics emerges only in a more-realistic interactive experimental setting. A comparison of the outcomes in the 1 -on- 1 dribble and preparatory GRF states showed that, in the non-weighted state, the defenders guarded successfully in 68. 0 % of the trials, and the defender's initiation time was earlier than that in the weighted state (39. 1 %). In terms of kinetics, the root mean squares of the derivative of hip abduction and three extension torques in the non-weighted state were smaller than those in the weighted state, irrespective of the outcome. These results indicate that the <b>preparatory</b> <b>body</b> state as explained by short-term joint torque fluctuations before the defensive step would help explain the performance in competitive sports, and will give insights into understanding human adaptive behavior in unpredicted and uncontrolled environments...|$|R
40|$|The European Union (EU) is {{the most}} {{far-reaching}} attempt yet undertaken to institutionalize democratic policy-making beyond the nation-state. To what extent, and in what ways, do various channels of representation contribute towards the realization of this aim? This dissertation takes stock of current research on the EU’s system of representation, and seeks to expand its agenda so that this central question can be properly addressed. In contrast to prior empirical work in the field, the dissertation employs research designs that incorporate several forms of representation into a unified evaluative framework. This multi-channel approach to political representation paves {{the way for a}} systematic comparison of how different forms of representation (electoral, territorial and corporate) perform in the EU context. It also makes possible an empirical assessment of a key proposition in current representation theory: that elections, in large and heterogeneous political systems, are outperformed by other forms of representation. The three articles in the dissertation draw on existing cross-country data, interviews with policy-makers and a new dataset collected by the author. They scrutinize representation in three principal channels: electoral representation in the European Parliament, government representation in the <b>preparatory</b> <b>bodies</b> of the Council of Ministers, and representation through organized interests that seek to influence EU policy. The first article examines the balance of power that has emerged between these three channels of representation in the EU’s legislative process, and how the current balance is likely to affect the Union’s legitimacy. The second article investigates how different channels of representation perform in terms of providing linkage between Brussels-based representatives and their domestic principals. The third article examines the extent to which different channels of representation contribute to the coordination of EU policy-making domestically, at the European level, and across the two levels of government. Finally, this dissertation makes a methodological contribution by applying social network analysis (SNA) to classic problems of representation within and across different channels of representation. This approach is novel to the field. Researchers should be able to exploit SNA and relational data fruitfully in the future, in the study of representational relationships in the EU and numerous other contexts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} an {{adaptive}} agent model is presented with capabilities to interpret another agent’s emotions. The presented agent model {{is based on}} recent advances in neurological context. First a non-adaptive agent model for emotion reading is described involving (<b>preparatory)</b> mirroring <b>body</b> states of the other agent. Here emotion reading is modelled {{taking into account the}} Simulation Theory perspective as known from the literature, involving the own body states and emotions in reading somebody else’s emotions. This models an agent that first develops the same feeling, and after feeling the emotion imputes it to the other agent. Next the agent model is extended to an adaptive model based on a Hebbian learning principle to develop a direct connection between a sensed stimulus concerning another agent’s body state (e. g., face expression) and the emotion recognition state. In this adaptive agent model the emotion is imputed to the other agent before it is actually felt. The agent model has been designed based on principles of neural modelling, and as such has a close relation to a neurological realisation...|$|R
40|$|Three-dimensional trunk motion. trunk muscle {{electromyography}} and {{intra-abdominal pressure}} were evaluated {{to investigate the}} preparatory control of the trunk associated with voluntary unilateral upper limb movement. The directions of angular motion produced by moments reactive to limb movement in each direction were predicted using a three-dimensional model of the <b>body.</b> <b>Preparatory</b> motion of the trunk occurred in three dimensions in the directions opposite to the reactive moments. Electromyographic recordings from the superficial trunk muscles were consistent with preparatory trunk motion. However, activation of transversus abdominis was inconsistent with control of direction-specific moments acting on the trunk. The results provide evidence that anticipatory postural adjustments result in movements and not simple rigidification of the trunk. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Two {{types of}} {{modelling}} approaches exist to reading an observed person’s emotions: {{with or without}} making use of the observing person’s own emotions. This paper focuses on an integrated approach that combines both types of approaches in an adaptive manner. The proposed models were inspired by recent advances in neurological context. Both a neural model and a more abstracted cognitive model are presented. In the first place emotion reading is modelled involving (<b>preparatory)</b> mirroring of <b>body</b> states of the observed person within the observing person. This involves a recursive body loop: a converging positive feedback loop based on reciprocal causation between preparations for body states and emotions felt. Here emotion reading involves the person’s own body states and emotions in reading somebody else’s emotions: first the same feeling is developed by mirroring, and after feeling the emotion, it is imputed to the other person. In the second place, as an extension an adaptive process is modelled based on Hebbian learning of a direct connection between a sensed stimulus concerning another agent’s body state (e. g., face expression) and an emotion imputation state. After this Hebbian learning process the emotion is imputed to the other agent before it is actually felt, or even without it is felt. Both the mirroring and Hebbian learning processes first have been modelled at a neural level, and next, in a more abstracted form at a cognitive level. By means of an interpretation mapping the paper shows {{the relation between the}} obtained cognitive model and the neurological model. In addition to specifications of both models and the interpretation mapping, simulation results are shown, and automated verification of relevant emerging properties is discussed...|$|R
50|$|To {{ascertain}} {{that all}} decision-making processes {{are based on}} a qualified analysis of correct facts, the School Management Team and Faculty Board is backed by a number of advisory committees and boards. The Swedish Government stipulates that all <b>preparatory</b> and decision-making <b>bodies</b> dealing with educational matters within Swedish universities must have student representation. Accordingly, the Student Association is represented on all these advisory bodies.All vacant academic positions are publicly advertised internationally and candidates evaluated by external referees for proficiency and merit. An Appointments Board oversees the recruitment and evaluation process, with the final appointment decision being taken by the Faculty Board. Professors, who hold the highest academic position within the University, are formally appointed by the Vice-Chancellor following an application’s adoption by the Faculty Board.Research and education activities are discussed and coordinated through two separate preparatory committees. The Preparatory Committee for Research includes representatives from all departments, as well as one PhD student representative, and is responsible for developing common strategies for research, principles for the allocation of research resources between the departments, common principles for quality assessment, etc. The committee is chaired by the Assistant Dean. The Preparatory Committee for Education comprises representatives from all departments, major education units and programmes of the School, as well as one student representative, and handles all major questions regarding education at Bachelor and Master level. The committee is chaired by the Vice Dean.The Advisory Board - made up of leading management executives {{from a wide variety of}} companies such as AB Volvo, Volvo Car Corporation, SKF and Stena, as well as the Swedish financial and public sectors - provides strategic advice to the School Management Team and practical support. It also functions as a key communication tool with some of the School’s most important stakeholders. Some of the Advisory Board members are alumni of the School.|$|R
