40|$|Under våren 2005 fastställs doktrinen för markoperationer i den svenska Försvarsmakten. Doktrinen bygger på manövertänkandet, något som rimligen bör påverka hur armén bedriverförbandsövningar. För att kunna införa en ny doktrin krävs att den efterlevs, prövas ochutvärderas, inte minst för att kunna utveckla densamma. Det är förhållandevis enkelt att rentintellektuellt bekänna sig till de teorier om manöverkrigföring som doktrinen bygger på, det ärdesto svårare att tillämpa manöverkrigföringens principer och att skapa förbandsövningar som gördet möjligt att tillämpa dem. Problemet som studeras i denna uppsats är således följande:Återspeglas manöverkrigföringskonceptet i arméns slutövning (RSÖ- 04 Dubbeleken) ?Mitt påstående är att armén under RSÖ- 04 inte övar manöverkrigföring i den utsträckning somkrävs för att kunna införa och utveckla manövertänkandet inom armén. Syftet med uppsatsen är att kartlägga förekomsten av manöverkrigföringskonceptets centraladelar, läs principer, i arméns slutövning (RSÖ- 04). Som underordnat syfte finns att ta framindikatorer på manöverkrigföring. Analysen visar att manöverkrigföringskonceptet inte har återspeglats i RSÖ- 04 i de flestaavseenden och att mitt påstående har kunnat verifierats. The {{issue that}} has been studied in this essay is, whether the concept of {{maneuver}} warfare isreflected {{in one of the}} Swedish Army live exercises (LIVEX) called RSÖ- 04 “Dubbeleken”. My hypothesis is that the Swedish Army does not practise maneuver warfare during RSÖ- 04 “Dubbeleken” to the extent where the thoughts about maneuver warfare can beimplemented and developed within the army. The main purpose of this essay has been to measure the occurrence of the maneuverwarfare concept in LIVEX RSÖ- 04 “Dubbeleken”. The secondary purpose has been todevelop indicators to measure maneuver warfare. In order to fulfill the main purpose for this composition, my first step was to developindicators for maneuver warfare, {{in order to be able}} to measure to what extent maneuverwarfare has been practiced or in what way conditions were set to enable the units topractise maneuver warfare. The method for this was to study five different militaryauthors’ views about what is significant for maneuver warfare at the tactical level througha qualitative textual analysis. The result from the qualitative textual analysis was fourindicators for maneuver warfare and one indicator for how to train maneuver warfare:• Decentralized command and mission tactics• Surfaces and gaps• Surprise and deception• Focus of effort and combined arms• Free play exercise with an active, reactive opposing force. (Indicator for training.) My second step was to measure the occurrence of a maneuver warfare concept through acase study of the exercise RSÖ- 04 “Dubbeleken”. The method for this was to analyze theexercise by using the 5 indicators. The essay shows that the occurrence of a maneuver warfare concept was very low duringthe exercise studied, even though the <b>exercise</b> <b>director</b> stressed that maneuver warfare wasto be exercised. The reason for this is mainly because the necessary conditions to practicemaneuver warfare didn’t exist during the exercise. In the light of this, my hypothesis that the Swedish Army does not practice maneuverwarfare to the extent where the thoughts about maneuver warfare can be implemented anddeveloped within the army has been verified. The issue which has been studied, that is to say, whether the concept of maneuver warfareis reflected in the LIVEX studied, has been answered by a;No, not when it comes to all aspects. With this in mind, in the last part of the composition, I’ve reflected upon how the armyshould conduct their exercises in the future in order to be able to practise maneuverwarfare.
