25|$|Why {{does the}} Court not apply this clear law to these clear facts, and conclude, as <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> <b>that</b> the funding scheme {{here is a}} clear {{constitutional}} violation? The answer must be, in part, that the Court fails to confront the evidence {{set out in the}} preceding section. Throughout its opinion, the Court refers uniformly to Wide Awakes Christian viewpoint or its religious perspective, and in distinguishing funding of Wide Awake from the funding of a church, the Court maintains that Wide Awake is not a religious institution, at least in the usual sense. The Court does not quote the magazine's adoption of Saint Paul's exhortation to awaken to the nearness of salvation, or any of its articles enjoining readers to accept Jesus Christ, or the religious verses, or the religious textual analyses, or the suggested prayers. And so, it is easy for the Court to lose sight of what the University students and the Court of Appeals found so obvious, and to blanch the patently and frankly evangelistic character of the magazine by unrevealing allusions to religious points of view.|$|E

But he warned that fans were in for a longer wait than expected, after lead singer Brian Johnson suggested there would be new material the next year. Malcolm stated, [...] "You know what Brian's like. He just says things and then walks away. It'll be a little while– {{a year or two}} anyway. I've been doing some jamming on some song ideas but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> all the time, as do the rest of the band. We are still working.

But he knows just as well as <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> if I wasn't bump-drafting, he never would have had a shot to pass Junior." [...] Additionally, he denied that he drove more aggressively because he was leaving. Third-place {{finisher}} Kurt Busch argued Vickers was in a [...] "Catch-22" [...] situation: [...] "He was trying to help his teammate. It just didn't turn out that way. Vickers was doing the best he could to help the 48. He just didn't anticipate the 8 car blocking as long as he did." [...] Vickers would later receive additional security during the next race weekend.|$|E

And if <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> within a week, tops, I'll be smoking crack." [...] Following the plane crash, Goldstein was prescribed painkillers and anti-anxiety medication. Celebrity doctor Drew Pinsky said it was those prescriptions which opened the [...] "floodgates" [...] to Goldstein's relapse. A friend of his reached the same conclusion, saying: [...] "I think the plane crash killed him, it just took a year for it to do it." [...] As a result of the plane crash, Goldstein developed a fear of flying, and continued consuming anxiety medication to help deal with the regular flights his lifestyle required.|$|E

500|$|When {{beginning}} {{work on her}} then-untitled third studio album, Stefani sought {{inspiration from}} her personal life in order to write lyrics for new material. She noted:... I was also in a really desperate place doing This Is What The Truth Feels Like, and I wasn’t back {{to a place of}} naiveté and purity. It was, 'All I have left right now is my music. And if <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> maybe I’ll survive.' So, the way Tragic Kingdom was pure, this new record was pure. I was making this record because it’s all I could do to save my own life. She described this as a magical process. Immediately following the completion of [...] "Make Me Like You", Stefani wrote [...] "Misery" [...] with Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, Mattias Larsson, and Robin Frediksson; however, unlike the recording sessions for her previous albums, the songwriting process was significantly shorter, which she opined was because everything should be simple. [...] "Misery" [...] was recorded by Mattias Larsson and Robin Frediksson of Mattman & Robin at Wolf Cousins Studios and Maratone Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, and at Interscope Studios in Santa Monica, California. Additional recording was handled by Juan Carlos Torrado and Noah Passovoy, while Serban Ghenea mixed the audio at Mixstar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia.|$|E
500|$|With {{the score}} 2–0 to Reading, the goalkeeper Steve Death {{threw the ball}} to the right back Gary Peters, who spotted Friday {{standing}} near the left-hand corner of the opposing penalty area. Peters passed high and diagonally across the pitch towards his forward, who jumped into the air and used his chest to cushion the ball and knock it into the air with his back to goal, about 25–30 yards away from the net. As Friday landed, he ferociously powered the ball towards goal, kicking over his shoulder and turning after the ball had gone. The shot flew straight into the top-right-hand corner of the net, stunning the crowd, players and Thomas, the referee, who put his hands over his head in disbelief. [...] "I'll never forget it", Thomas recalled. [...] "It was the sheer ferocity of the shot on the volley ... over his shoulder. ... If it hadn't gone into the top corner of the net it would have broken the goalpost. Even up against the likes of Pelé and Cruyff, that rates as the best goal I have ever seen." [...] Reading {{went on to win the}} game 5–0. When Thomas told Friday after the game that he had never seen a better goal, the Londoner replied, [...] "Really? You should come down here more often, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> every week." ...|$|E

2500|$|That same year, Robyn {{returned}} home to Sweden and discovered the electronic music brother-and-sister duo The Knife while browsing through a record store. She became inspired by how the duo self-financed and released their recordings, and bought herself out of her recording contract with Jive Records.

2500|$|In the past, Cave {{identified}} as a Christian. In his recorded lectures on music and songwriting, he has claimed that any true love song is a song for God and has ascribed the mellowing of his music to a shift in focus from the Old to the New Testaments. He {{does not belong to}} a particular denomination and has distanced himself from [...] "religion as being an American thing, in which the name of God has been hijacked". He said in a Los Angeles Times article: [...] "I'm not religious, and I'm not a Christian, but I do reserve the right to believe in the possibility of a god. It's kind of defending the indefensible, though; I'm critical of what religions are becoming, the more destructive they're becoming. But I think as an artist, particularly, it's a necessary part of what <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> <b>that</b> there is some divine element going on within my songs." [...] When asked in 2009 about whether he believed in a personal God, Cave's reply was: [...] "No". When interviewed by Jarvis Cocker on 12 September 2010, for his BBC Radio 6 show [...] "Jarvis Cocker's Sunday Service", Cave stated: [...] "I believe in God in spite of religion, not because of it." ...|$|E

[...] While comparing her to Kesha, Idolator wrote that [...] "Dev's beats come off a bit more mellow and her songs {{a little bit more}} electro than pop." [...] In response to being compared to both Kesha and Uffie, Dev said, [...] "I just feel that I have a lot more to say and the ability to have an eclectic sound, I'm not bashing either artist, but I'm {{going to be able to}} give you a little bit more than what you've heard on those records. When my album comes out, hopefully I won't have to hear another reference or comparison." [...] Much of Dev's music is inspired by rap music, as she believes that fans respond to [...] "pop music but with rap roots". She said, [...] "I've always been into hip-hop. Eminem changed my life when I was younger." [...] The Hollywood Reporter compared her [...] "futuristic" [...] and [...] "pulsing" [...] sound to underground electroclash musicians Peaches and Yelle. Dev's musical genres have been cited as electro-crunk and electropop.|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} with the Associated Press, Knowles said that one of the hardest parts of the tour was [...] "squeezing a decade's worth of hits into a two-hour show" [...] and performing the songs in designer Thierry Mugler's [...] "elaborate" [...] costumes. She elaborated: [...] "I'm never gonna go onstage or do a video and not work until my feet are blistered, and until I'm basically, I can't walk any more. I always give, and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> because I know how lucky I am, to do my job." [...] She also promised that the tour would be more emotional than The Beyoncé Experience because of the [...] "real raw and more sensitive" [...] nature of the I Am... portion of the double album. Knowles also expressed frustration that snippets of the show appeared online after the first shows on the opening leg, [...] "ruining" [...] some of the surprise of the concert experience and possibly convincing some fans not to attend. She went on saying: [...] "It's great because people can get a little sneak peek and say, 'Oh, I wanna come to the show,' or, 'I don't wanna go to that show'... and I'm fans of people so I go on there and check it out too. But you put so much of your heart and time into the wardrobe... it's kind of unfortunate that people can see the show months before you get into their city, but that's life." [...] French designer Thierry Mugler collaborated with Knowles on the wardrobe and had a creative advisor role, as he also contributed to designing the whole show, from lighting to choreography, production and directing three sequences for the concert.
