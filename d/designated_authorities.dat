50|$|In the past, {{letters rogatory}} could not usually be {{transmitted}} directly between the applicable courts, {{and had to}} be transmitted via consular or diplomatic channels, which could make the whole process very slow. There have been various international conventions in regard to service of process and taking of evidence. One of the earliest conventions to simplify the procedure of Letters Rogatory was the 1905 Civil Procedure Convention, signed at The Hague. Drafted only in French, it was only ratified by 22 countries. Later conventions, created after the institution of the Hague Conference on Private International Law, drafted in both English and French commanded more support. The Hague Service Convention, ratified in 1965, enabled <b>designated</b> <b>authorities</b> in each of the signatory states to transmit documents for service to each other, bypassing the diplomatic route. This convention has been ratified by 60 states including the United Kingdom and the United States, neither of whom had ratified the 1905 convention. The Hague Evidence Convention, ratified in 1970, formalised procedures for taking of evidence. This convention has been ratified by 43 states. For situations exclusively among Member States of the European Union, two regulations, 1348/2000 and 1206/2001 superseded the two Hague Conventions.

40|$|Forest Focus (Regulation (EC) No 2152 / 2003) is a Community {{scheme for}} harmonised, broad-based, {{comprehensive}} and long-term monitoring of European forest ecosystems. It concentrates in particular on protecting forests against {{air pollution and}} fire. To supplement the monitoring system, Forest Focus stipulates {{the development of new}} instruments relating to soil monitoring, carbon sequestration, biodiversity, climate change and protective functions of forests. Under this scheme the monitoring of air pollution effects on forests is carried out by participating countries {{on the basis of the}} systematic network of observation points (Level I) and of the network of observation plots for intensive and continuous monitoring (Level II). The monitoring activity continues from the network and plots established and implemented under Council Regulation (EEC) No 3528 / 86. and Regulations (EEC) No 1696 / 87 and (EC) No 1091 / 94. The monitoring programme of air pollution effects is linked to International Cooperative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forest (ICP Forests). ICP Forests reports to the working Group on Effects of the Convention of the Long-Range Trans-boundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN-ECE). Forest Focus Article 15 (1) stipulates that the Member States shall annually, through the <b>designated</b> <b>authorities</b> and agencies, forward to the Commission geo-referenced data gathered under the scheme, together with a report on them by means of computer telecommunications and/or electronic technology.

30|$|The {{importance}} of workplace {{safety in the}} ready-made garment (RMG) industry in Bangladesh came to the forefront {{after a series of}} disastrous events in recent years. In order to reduce the loss of lives and to ensure sustainable development, an in-depth understanding of the determining factors governing structural vulnerability in the RMG industry is needed. This research explores the key factors influencing the vulnerability of factory buildings under both vertical and earthquake loads. For this purpose, an ordered probit model was applied to 3746 RMG factory buildings to determine the key factors that influenced their vertical load vulnerability. A smaller subset of the original sample, 478 buildings, was examined by the same modeling method in greater detail to assess the key factors that influenced their earthquake load vulnerability. This research reveals that column capacity, structural system, and construction materials are the most influential factors for both types of vulnerabilities. Among other factors, soil liquefaction and irregular internal frame affect earthquake load vulnerability significantly. These findings are expected to enable factory owners and designers to better weigh the appropriate vulnerability factors in order to make informed decision that increase workplace safety. The research findings will also help the <b>designated</b> <b>authorities</b> to conduct successful inspections of factory buildings and take actions that reduce vulnerability to both vertical and earthquake loads.|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of supervision and probation programs for driving-while-intoxicated (DWI) offenders. These programs include case-specific restrictions (e. g., individualized conditions to probation), unsupervised probation, basic supervision probation (e. g., regularly scheduled visits to probation services with varying frequency), and intensive supervision probation (which may involve many program components and close monitoring). Offenders who receive monitoring through intensive supervision programs (ISPs) have more contact with probation officers, a judge, or other <b>designated</b> <b>authorities</b> compared to standard (nonintensive) probation programs. Three ISPs were evaluated: the Minnesota Staggered Sentencing Program, the Westchester County New York DWI Enforcement Program, and the Oregon Driving Under the Influence of Intoxicants (DUII) Intensive Supervision Program (DISP). The Minnesota program {{appeared to be}} successful in reducing offender recidivism in a relatively small ISP (n= 200 offenders in the program). Compared to a similar matched group of DWI offenders, the staggered sentencing offenders had a significant 30. 6 % lower recidivism rate (p=. 017) up to 4 years postoffense. The program prevented an estimated 15 to 23 re-arrests for DWI. Compared to a matched group of offenders, the Westchester County program appeared to be effective in the short term (18. 1 % lower recidivism in 5 years postoffense [p. 001).

40|$|Various {{activities}} to enhance security against terrorist threats were initiated {{in response to}} the 9 / 11 attacks in the United States of America. In 2004 the European Union released regulations based on the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS Code) requiring ship owners, harbor operators, as well as <b>designated</b> <b>authorities</b> and other maritime stakeholders, to implement measures and procedures to prevent possible terrorist attacks on port facilities and ships. Enhancing maritime security is conceived as a risk management activity and in order to determine which security measures are required, a risk assessment must be conducted. The ISPS Code provides the standardized, consistent, high-level framework to be used to evaluate these risks. In this paper, the framework, based on threat, vulnerability, and consequences, and its practical use for preventive risk management activities were reviewed. Preliminary results are described and recommendations to improve the process are provided. The findings suggest that the numbers that are produced by most risk analyses methods are not as accurate as the output may suggest, and therefore {{may not be the best}} base for preparing risk management activities. We propose that the process of conducting a risk analysis, rather than the numbers produced, holds the true value for understanding and prevention. The risk analysis methodology should be re-structured to capture the content of this process, considering additional options for collecting input, updates and insight from a wide range of experts, as well as for additional sharing of some of the output...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an autonomous wireless system that generates road safety alerts, {{in the form}} of SMS and email messages, and sends them to motorists subscribed to the service. Drivers who regularly traverse a par-ticular route are the main beneficiaries of the proposed system, which is intended for sparsely populated rural areas, where information available to drivers about road safety, especially bridge conditions, is very limited. At the heart of this system is the SmartBrick, a wireless system for remote structural health monitoring that has been presented in our previous work. Sensors on the SmartBrick network regularly collect data on water level, temperature, strain, and other parameters important to safety of a bridge. This information is stored on the device, and reported to a remote server over the GSM cellular infrastructure. The system generates alerts indi-cating hazardous road conditions when the data exceeds thresholds that can be remotely changed. The remote server and any number of <b>designated</b> <b>authorities</b> can be notified by email, FTP, and SMS. Drivers can view road conditions and subscribe to SMS and/or email alerts through a web page. The subscription-only form of alert generation has been deliberately selected to mitigate privacy concerns. The proposed system can significantly increase the safety of travel through rural areas. Real-time availability of information to transportation author-ities and law enforcement officials facilitates early or proactive reaction to road hazards. Direct notification of drivers further increases the utility of the system in increasing the safety of the traveling public...|$|E

The existing strategies {{of the government and}} public health service providers to manage the situation have had limited success. Researchers have noted the lack of including those experiencing homelessness to better understand and find a solution to homelessness. The purpose of this phenomenological study, driven by the social cognitive theory, was to understand homelessness from the perspectives of people who do not have homes. Data were collected from open-ended interviews with a purposeful sample of 15 individuals who are homeless. Summarizing and analyzing the interviews, several themes emerged after interview data were transcribed via hand coding and analyzed using cognitive data analysis. The prominent themes were: lack namely, money, home, privacy, and support; discrimination of all kinds; mental illness and addiction; the need for a review of housing policy that specifically addresses rent, mortgage qualification criteria and house tax, and to create awareness of government support systems and the services that they provide. Public health service providers and <b>designated</b> <b>authorities</b> can use {{the findings of this study}} to understand the phenomenon from the perspective of people who are experiencing homelessness, and in turn can use that understanding to influence improved homelessness reduction strategies that could improve the lives of those experiencing homelessness and their communities.
