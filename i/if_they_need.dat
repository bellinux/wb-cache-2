5|$|Patients {{often ask}} <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to have special safety {{precautions}} around {{family and friends}} after receiving brachytherapy. If temporary brachytherapy is used, no radioactive sources remain in the body after treatment. Therefore, there is no radiation risk to friends or family from being in close proximity with them.|$|E
5|$|Air {{breathing}} {{fish can}} be divided into obligate air breathers and facultative air breathers. Obligate air breathers, such as the African lungfish, must breathe air periodically or they suffocate. Facultative air breathers, such as the catfish Hypostomus plecostomus, only breathe air <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to and will otherwise rely on their gills for oxygen. Most air breathing fish are facultative air breathers that avoid the energetic cost of rising to the surface and the fitness cost of exposure to surface predators.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Alan {{discovers that}} his license has {{arrived in the}} mail. Ecstatic, he wishes to drive immediately, asking his family members <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> help with any errands. Later, Hal {{shows up at the}} Dixon home. Knowing that Alan's license had been {{scheduled}} to arrive, he begins to talk to Alan, telling him about things he should know {{in order to be able}} to drive safely. As he finishes giving the advice, Frank Jr. and Betty return home. Alan asks his father if he can drive the car into town. His father lets him, and Frank Jr. and Betty agree to go with him to make sure he arrives safely.|$|E

They may call down to the on-field officials to stop play <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> extra {{time to make a}} review. Each coach may also make one challenge per game. In the case of a coach's challenge, the coach must have at least one time-out remaining. If the challenge is upheld the coach gets the time-out back but the challenge is spent. If the challenge is rejected, both the challenge and the time-out are spent.|$|E

25|$|Optimization {{can occur}} {{at a number}} of levels. Typically the higher levels have greater impact, and are harder to change later on in a project, {{requiring}} significant changes or a complete rewrite <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to be changed. Thus optimization can typically proceed via refinement from higher to lower, with initial gains being larger and achieved with less work, and later gains being smaller and requiring more work. However, in some cases overall performance depends on performance of very low-level portions of a program, and small changes at a late stage or early consideration of low-level details can have outsized impact. Typically some consideration is given to efficiency throughout a project – though this varies significantly – but major optimization is often considered a refinement to be done late, if ever. On longer-running projects there are typically cycles of optimization, where improving one area reveals limitations in another, and these are typically curtailed when performance is acceptable or gains become too small or costly.|$|E
25|$|Inventory credit {{refers to}} the use of stock, or inventory, as {{collateral}} to raise finance. Where banks may be reluctant to accept traditional collateral, for example in developing countries where land title may be lacking, inventory credit is a potentially important way of overcoming financing constraints. This is not a new concept; archaeological evidence suggests that it was practiced in Ancient Rome. Obtaining finance against stocks {{of a wide range of}} products held in a bonded warehouse is common in much of the world. It is, for example, used with Parmesan cheese in Italy. Inventory credit on the basis of stored agricultural produce is widely used in Latin American countries and in some Asian countries. A precondition for such credit is that banks must be confident that the stored product will be available <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to call on the collateral; this implies the existence of a reliable network of certified warehouses. Banks also face problems in valuing the inventory. The possibility of sudden falls in commodity prices means that they are usually reluctant to lend more than about 60% of the value of the inventory at the time of the loan.|$|E
25|$|Promoting {{independence}} in self-care can provide {{older adults with}} the capability to maintain independence longer and can leave them {{with a sense of}} achievement when they complete a task unaided. Older adults that require assistance with activities of daily living are at a greater risk of losing their independence with self-care tasks as dependent personal behaviours are often met with reinforcement from caregivers. It is important for caregivers to ensure that measures are put into place to preserve and promote function rather than contribute to a decline in status in an older adult that has physical limitations. Caregivers need to be conscious of actions and behaviors that cause older adults to become dependent on them and need to allow older patients to maintain as much independence as possible. Providing information to the older patient on why it is important to perform self-care may allow them to see the benefit in performing self-care independently. If the older adult is able to complete self-care activities on their own, or even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> supervision, encourage them in their efforts as maintaining independence can provide them with a sense of accomplishment and the ability to maintain independence longer.|$|E

500|$|Stephen Graziano and Velton Ray Bunch {{composed}} original {{music for}} the series. Composed by Randy Edelman, the distinctive theme music gained recognition beyond the show's following; in the mid-1990s, the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) hired Edelman to provide music for its sports coverage, including National Football League games and the Olympics. The music samples Edelman sent NBC included the Brisco theme, and by 1996 it was being used during coverage of the Olympics. NBC used it again as the theme for their coverage of the 1997 World Series. Edelman said, [...] "It was original, {{and it seemed to}} have the right spirit. It's got a very flowing melody, it's triumphant, and it has a certain warmth. And it has at the end of it, what all television things like this have, a 'button', an ending flourish that works really well <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to chop it down into a 15-second thing." [...] Cary Darling said that the [...] "booming" [...] theme song was [...] "part Magnificent Seven, part Aaron Copland and as grand and wide as 'Big Sky Country'".|$|E
2500|$|Although Old Irish {{has both}} a sound [...] {{and a letter}} h, there is no {{consistent}} relationship between the two. Vowel-initial words are sometimes written with an unpronounced h, {{especially if they are}} very short (the preposition [...] "in" [...] was sometimes written [...] ) or <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to be emphasised (the name of Ireland, , was sometimes written [...] ). On the other hand, words that begin with the sound [...] are usually written without it: [...] "her gold". If the sound and the spelling co-occur, it is by coincidence, as [...] "it is not".|$|E
2500|$|Another {{highlight}} in {{the debate}} happened when candidates were asked by Chris Matthews <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to go to Congress to get authorization to take military action against Iran's nuclear facilities, if they were president of the United States. While Hunter, Huckabee, McCain, Thompson and Giuliani replied they would not obtain Congressional authorization {{if there was an}} imminent threat from Iran. Romney replied, [...] "You sit down with your attorneys and (they) tell you what you have to do..." [...] Paul advocated obtaining Congressional authorization, which he claimed is mandated by the US Constitution.|$|E
50|$|In art, vellum {{was used}} for paintings, {{especially}} <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> to be sent long distances, before canvas became widely used in about 1500, and continued {{to be used for}} drawings, and watercolours.

2500|$|Kucinich {{was criticized}} during his 2004 {{campaign}} for changing his {{stance on the}} issue of abortion. His explanation was [...] "I've always worked to make abortions less necessary, through sex education and birth control. But the direction that Congress has taken, increasingly, is to make it impossible for women {{to be able to have}} an abortion <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to protect their health. So when I saw the direction taken, it finally came to the point where I understood that women will not be truly free unless they have the right to choose." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{advantage}} of divisional structure {{is that it}} uses delegated authority so the performance can be directly measured with each group. This results in managers performing better and high employee morale. [...] Another {{advantage of}} using divisional structure {{is that it is}} more efficient in coordinating work between different divisions, and there is more flexibility to respond when there is a change in the market. Also, a company will have a simpler process <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to change the size of the business by either adding or removing divisions. When divisional structure is utilized more specialization can occur within the groups. When divisional structure is organized by product, the customer has their own advantages especially when only a few services or products are offered which differ greatly. When using divisional structures that are organized by either markets or geographic areas they generally have similar function and are located in different regions or markets. This allows business decisions and activities coordinated locally.|$|E
2500|$|Paul argues {{against the}} {{prevailing}} {{system of government}} licensure of physicians and other healthcare practitioners. In a 2007 interview, Paul accused the medical profession of choosing to maintain a strict licensing system that permits {{only a small number}} of individuals to practice in order to be able to charge much higher fees. He insisted that with a truly competitive marketplace for health services, a patient with a sore throat, for instance, would be able to be seen by a nurse more rapidly than by a medical doctor and treated by the nurse for only a fraction of the cost of what a medical doctor would charge. [...] "Patients can sort this out. I mean, they're not going to go to the nurse <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> brain surgery. They can go there for a sore throat." [...] He believes that patients would be best served by healthcare practitioners operating under the rules of the free market in voluntary contractual arrangements. Paul feels that anyone who claims to be a healthcare practitioner (whether of allopathic, homeopathic, or naturopathic medicine) should be able to offer healthcare services, without interference from the “nanny state.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The French {{government}} claimed [...] that S.A.S {{could not}} be considered a victim within in the meaning of the Convention's Article 34 which says any persons who claim to be a victim of a violation of the Convention can put forward an application to the Court. They questioned how important the full veil was for her religious practice, given that she only wore the veil at certain occasions and not at other, and underlined that she had never been stopped by the police. S.A.S argued that she was a potential victim as a devout Muslim and said the possibility of wearing a full veil was important to her. The court stated that while protection after Article 9 on religious freedom required a certain level of seriousness and cohesion, a state could not overrule which religious practices a person considered important; and underlined that a manifestation of religion [...] didn't need to be mandatory within a religion to be protected. The court further expressed that a person can be considered a victim <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> to modify their behaviour to avoid risk of prosecution, or belonged to a group that risks being directly affected by the law, and found this applied to S.A.S. Her claim of being a victim [...] was therefore accepted by the court.|$|E
2500|$|The {{staff for}} the first season {{consisted}} of Kripke and five other writers, with assistants to help with researching urban legends. Most of the work done in writing the series is very collaborative, with the writers often breaking up into groups. At {{the beginning of each}} season, the writers are brought together and pitch their ideas, which are then assigned to a specific writer to be developed. Each story idea is outlined on a dry-erase board, with Kripke and Bob Singer making necessary changes. Afterward, the script is written, and Kripke goes through it to make sure it has the same tone as other episodes. Kripke found this task very difficult to do in the first season, but he felt it became easier by the third season, as the staff came to [...] "really understand the show's style". Following the fifth season, Kripke stepped down as showrunner but maintained his connection with the series as an executive consultant. In a 2006 interview with Collider, he responded to the question as to how involved he still is with the show with the answer: [...] "I would define myself as a proud parent who has sent their child off to college." [...] He elaborate on this analogy, explaining, [...] "I'm there <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> me, I'm happy to help, but I also stay out of their way if they don't need me." ...|$|E

5000|$|At {{this point}} in the restoration, the {{demodulation}} of the tapes had become the biggest issue. The team was not sure if the demodulation board that came with the system was the correct one, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> a different one, or <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> this one and another one. At the same time, they discovered a tape, which, from the audio clip at the start, sounded as if it contained a demodulated recording of one of the images. This was a lucky break, as it meant that a demodulator would not be needed to generate images from this tape. If the team could rescue this image, the project would prove [...] "that the drive can be refurbished to the point of reliably playing a tape back". Work continued, and the team coined the term [...] "technoarchaeology" [...] to describe the process of researching which tape contained what image.|$|R
