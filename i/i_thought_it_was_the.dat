500|$|Harring {{described}} her interpretation {{after seeing the}} film: [...] "When I saw it the first time, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> story of Hollywood dreams, illusion and obsession. It touches {{on the idea that}} nothing is quite as it seems, especially the idea of being a Hollywood movie star. The second and third times I saw it, I thought it dealt with identity. Do we know who we are? And then I kept seeing different things in it... There's no right or wrong to what someone takes away from it or what they think the film is really about. It's a movie that makes you continuously ponder, makes you ask questions. I've heard over and over, 'This is a movie that I'll see again' or 'This is a movie you've got to see again.' It intrigues you. You want to get it, but I don't think it's a movie to be gotten. It's achieved its goal if it makes you ask questions." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1902 Loving {{was tapped}} to {{organize}} the Philippine Constabulary Band {{on the recommendation of}} Governor-General of the Philippines William Howard Taft, who had earlier heard Loving's 45th regimental band perform. Loving, who had learned both Spanish and Tagalog during his brief time in the Philippines, developed an instant rapport with his bandsmen. During the period in which Loving led the Philippine Constabulary Band it established a reputation for excellence both in the Philippines and the United States. The U.S. military periodical Army and Navy Life described the band as [...] "one of the finest of all military bands in the world," [...] while the Pacific Coast Musical Review, opined that [...] "the Philippine Constabulary Band is in a class by itself." [...] During a 1915 performance in San Francisco, California, John Philip Sousa was invited to guest conduct the group, afterwards commenting that, [...] "when I closed my eyes, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> United States Marine Band." ...|$|E
500|$|Timmons became {{best known}} as a member of Art Blakey's band the Jazz Messengers, which he was first part of from July 1958 to September 1959, {{including}} for a tour of Europe. He was recruited for the Messengers by saxophonist Benny Golson, who said that [...] "He was inventive, [...] He could play bebop and he could play funky – he could play a lot of things, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> element that Art needed. He hadn't had anybody quite like Bobby, who could go here or go there, rather than walking in a single corridor." [...] By late 1958 Timmons was sharing bandmate Morgan's East Sixth Street apartment and the pair had bought a piano, allowing Timmons to practice and Morgan to work on composing. From around the time he joined Blakey, Timmons, along with some of his fellow band members, was a heroin user. After leaving Blakey, Timmons joined Cannonball Adderley's band, in October 1959.|$|E

500|$|In two {{separate}} 2016 AMAs on Reddit, both Nick Jonas and Joe Jonas {{reflected on the}} episode. [...] "When it first came out I didn't think it was funny to be honest, but probably because I was actually living all of that in real time, so it just made it harder to come and live your life as a young person and have all that going on," [...] Nick said. [...] "But years later and once the purity rings were no longer around, it was very funny to me and I've actually watched the episode a few times." [...] "I loved it. When it first came out I was so pumped". Joe said. [...] "I know that Nick was really kind of not into watching it, but <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> funniest thing {{at the time and}} it's kind of a compliment because obviously {{if you go to a}} comedy show and they pick you out and make fun of you, you can't heckle back, you gotta just take it and enjoy it, and for me I've always been a fan and I knew that was kind of a wow we made it moment, and also they were kind of attacking Disney more than me, so I didn't really feel threatened.

2500|$|Although not a {{tropical}} cyclone, the storm brought back memories of Cyclone Aila, which killed 155 {{people in the}} same area in May 2009. One eyewitness described the storm: [...] "It was all dark. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> end of the world {{and we were going to}} die." [...] Locals received no warning of the impending storm, and were mostly sleeping when the storm hit, increasing the casualties.

2500|$|Punk in Drublic was {{followed}} by the 1996 CD Heavy Petting Zoo, whose LP companion featured different cover art and the name Eating Lamb. The artwork for the CD featured a man holding a sheep, while the LP depicted the same man in a 69 position with the sheep. The Eating Lamb version was banned from sale in Germany due to its obscene cover art. The LP version did not achieve the success of its predecessor, although it was the first NOFX record to achieve a position on the Billboard charts, reaching number 63. Fat Mike stated: [...] "Weird record. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> coolest record when we finished it, but a few months later I wasn't so sure. Some of those songs are kinda weird. I like the cover a lot though. I think it sold well in Belgium." ...|$|E

It was such a cleansing experience." [...] Contacting Lynch, he agreed {{to help him with}} his next planned project, a film titled Ronnie Rocket for which Lynch had already written a script. However, Lynch soon realized that Ronnie Rocket, a film that he described as being about [...] "electricity and a three-foot guy with red hair", {{was not going to be}} picked up by any financiers, and so he asked Cornfeld to find him a script written by someone else which he could direct. Cornfeld found him four possible scripts. On hearing the title of the first, The Elephant Man, Lynch chose the script.|$|E
2500|$|Edith Grossman, {{who wrote}} and {{published}} a highly acclaimed English {{translation of the}} novel in 2003, says that the book is mostly meant to move people into emotion using a systematic change of course, {{on the verge of}} both tragedy and comedy at the same time. Grossman has stated:The question is that Quixote has multiple interpretations [...] and how do I deal with that in my translation. I'm going to answer your question by avoiding it [...] so when I first started reading the Quixote <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> most tragic book in the world, and I would read it and weep [...] As I grew older [...] my skin grew thicker [...] and so when I was working on the translation I was actually sitting at my computer and laughing out loud. This is done [...] as Cervantes did it [...] by never letting the reader rest. You are never certain that you truly got it. Because as soon as you think you understand something, Cervantes introduces something that contradicts your premise.|$|E
2500|$|On July 5, 2008, Tulowitzki {{went back}} on the {{disabled}} list after cutting his right palm in the previous day's 18–17 home win over the Florida Marlins. The injury occurred {{in the bottom of the}} seventh inning when Tulowitzki slammed a maple bat into the ground in frustration. The incident took place after he was taken out of the game in that same inning; however, he noted that the frustration leading up to his injury wasn't due to being taken out, saying, [...] "I was a little bit frustrated, not at the move. If anything, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> right move. I came in the hallway, grabbed a bat, hit it on the ground and the bat exploded in my hand and cut open my palm running up to my index finger." [...] The cut required 16 stitches, but no damage was done to any tendons or nerves. Tulowitzki returned to the Rockies lineup, starting at shortstop, on July 21, 2008, in a 16–10 home loss against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He recorded a career-high five hits during the game, as he went 5-for-5 with one RBI. Also since returning from July 21 he has had 6 multi-hit games in his past 8 games (updated through July 29).
