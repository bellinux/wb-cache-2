5000|$|The {{considerate}} (relationship-oriented) {{style of}} leadership can be appropriate {{in an environment where}} the situation is moderately favorable or certain. For example, when (1) leader-member relations are good, (2) the task is structured, and (3) position power is either strong or weak. <b>Situations</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> exist with research scientists, who do not like superiors to structure the task for them.

2500|$|Empirical {{findings}} support the theoretical argument that the cultural group is a critical factor {{that needs to be}} studied in the context of situational variables. Rather than behaving in line with economic incentives, people are likely to approach the decision to cooperate with an appropriateness framework. An expanded, four factor model of the Logic of Appropriateness, suggests that the cooperation is better explained by the question: [...] "What does a person like me (identity) do (rules) <b>in</b> a <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> (recognition) given this culture (group)?" ...|$|R
50|$|However, {{there are}} some notable {{exceptions}} to this rule. Kaffi, for example, is an Icelandicised version of the French café or Italian caffè, both meaning ‘coffee’; {{that is to say}} that it has been adapted to the rules of Icelandic orthography. There are numerous other examples, including banani (in that case there was a proposed alternative, bjúgaldin, literally curved fruit, but that did not gain popularity). <b>In</b> <b>situations</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> it may be awkward or impossible to create words for things that simply do not exist in Iceland by nature; therefore some form of a loanword may have to be used.|$|E
50|$|In Sarrasine, Realism is {{reflected}} in the ways that every situation is described in its positive and negative aspects. For example, {{as a member of the}} castrati Zambinella can be praised, adored, or treated as if he doesn’t belong. The novella doesn’t romanticize the relationship between Zambinella and Sarrasine, either. The author depicts real and imperfect emotions between the two characters, from love to vengeance. Though Realism in literature was usually used for portraying the activities of middle and lower-class people, it was sometimes used <b>in</b> <b>situations</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> and indeed often focused on characters and situations that might otherwise be socially marginalized.|$|E
50|$|There {{are times}} when having {{specific}} goals is not a best option; {{this is the case}} when the goal requires new skills or knowledge. Tunnel vision is a consequence of specific goals; if a person is too focused on attaining a specific goal, he or she may ignore the need to learn new skills or acquire new information. <b>In</b> <b>situations</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> the best option is to set a learning goal. A learning goal is a generalized goal to achieve knowledge in a certain topic or field, but it can ultimately lead to better performance in specific goals related to the learning goals.|$|E
50|$|Act III {{gives us}} the father's {{perspective}} on the whole situation. He speaks of how, deeply saddened by his younger son's actions, he did the only thing a parent could do <b>in</b> a <b>situation</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> - he prayed, and continued loving. When his son finally came home, he joyfully accepted {{him back into the}} family with his complete heart. The only thing that saddens him still is that his older son, though doing all the right things outwardly, is more lost than the younger son ever was, because of his heart-attitude.|$|R

50|$|Clinical and {{translational}} {{data suggest}} that sensitive tumor types, with adequate parameters and functional apoptosis pathways, might not need high doses of mTOR inhibitors to trigger apoptosis. In most cases, cancer cells might only be partially sensitive to mTOR inhibitors due to redundant signal transduction or lack of functional apoptosis signaling pathways. <b>In</b> <b>situations</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> high doses of mTOR inhibitors might be required. In recent study of patients with Renal cell carcinoma, resistance to Temsirolimus was associated {{with low levels of}} p-AKT and p-S6K1, that play the key role in mTOR activation. These data strongly suggests number of tumors with an activated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway that does not respond to mTOR inhibitors. For future studies it is recommended to exclude patients with low or negative p-AKT levels from trials with mTOR inhibitors.|$|E

5000|$|Billy McGuire is Mickey's younger brother. A blonde haired boy, {{he often}} wears a short sleeve shirt, shorts with suspenders, and small shoes. Billy first {{appeared}} {{early on in}} the talkie era. During the silent era, Mickey often had to babysit his baby brother (played by a variety of unknown infants). Without any explanation, Billy showed up early in the talkie era, originally being known as [...] "Shorty". Billy's role in the series grew as time went on. He is essentially the runt of the group, sometimes left out of the fun for being too small. <b>In</b> <b>situations</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> Billy manages to outsmart the older kids, and proves that he can do just as much as they can, if not more. Other times, Billy winds up being the hero, saving the other kids from certain danger.

5000|$|Keyword {{extraction}} is {{the first}} step for identifying the input question type. In some cases, there are clear words that indicate the question type directly. i.e. [...] "Who", [...] "Where" [...] or [...] "How many", these words tell the system that the answers should be of type [...] "Person", [...] "Location", [...] "Number" [...] respectively. In the example above, the word [...] "When" [...] indicates that the answer should be of type [...] "Date". POS (Part of Speech) tagging and syntactic parsing techniques {{can also be used to}} determine the answer type. In this case, the subject is [...] "Chinese National Day", the predicate is [...] "is" [...] and the adverbial modifier is [...] "when", therefore the answer type is [...] "Date". Unfortunately, some interrogative words like [...] "Which", [...] "What" [...] or [...] "How" [...] do not give clear answer types. Each of these words can represent more than one type. <b>In</b> <b>situations</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> other words in the question need to be considered.

5000|$|One {{approach}} to cybering is a simulation of [...] "real" [...] sex, when participants {{try to make}} the experience as close to real life as possible, with participants taking turns writing descriptive, sexually explicit passages. Alternatively, it can be considered a form of sexual roleplay that allows the participants to experience unusual sexual sensations and carry out sexual experiments they cannot try in reality. Amongst [...] "serious" [...] roleplayers, cybering may occur {{as part of a larger}} plot-the characters involved may be lovers or spouses. <b>In</b> <b>situations</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> the people typing often consider themselves separate entities from the [...] "people" [...] engaging in the sexual acts, much as the author of a novel often does not completely identify with his or her characters. Due to this difference, such roleplayers typically prefer the term [...] "erotic roleplay" [...] rather than cybersex to describe it. In [...] "real cybering" [...] personas often remain in character throughout the entire life of the contact, to include evolving into phone sex, and meatspace encounters while in character, as a form of improvisation, or, nearly, a performance art. Often these personas develop complex past histories for their characters to make the fantasy/roleplay even more life like, thus the evolution of the term [...] "real cybering".|$|E

He was to distinguish himself {{during the course}} of this fighting. On 19 October he was prevented from delivering a message due to the presence of two Soviet anti-tank guns in good positions. Him and several comrades were able to approach the anti-tank guns and destroy them with explosives, enabling the necessary dispatch to be delivered. Five days later, on 24 October, he observed an enemy battalion preparing to attack the boundary between his company and the neighbouring one. Acting completely alone he crept forward and allowed the advancing Russian infantry to pass by, and then opened fire from a range of less than 200 meters. It was <b>in</b> <b>situations</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> where the murderous rate of fire of the MG 42 spoke for itself, and soon 100 Russians lay dead and the remainder fled. The Russians lay down artillery fire on his position but he retreated from his hole, returning to it when the barrage had lifted. He then repelled the next attack, during which a squad of Russians was able to get very close to his positions. He killed eight of them and took the remaining three prisoner. Despite his very low rank of Gefreiter, his repelling a large Russian infantry attack all by himself did not go unrecognized and he received the Knight's Cross.|$|E
