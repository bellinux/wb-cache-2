25|$|Perth {{sailed to}} Subic for <b>emergency</b> <b>maintenance</b> and rebarrelling on 26 October, and {{returned}} to Sea Dragon duties on 1 November. Another maintenance period occurred between 7 and 16 November, after which Perth sailed to Singapore for shore leave, returning to operations on 27 November. This gunline deployment lasted until 20 December, with Perth coming under shore battery fire on two occasions, but receiving no hits or damage. After maintenance at Subic, the destroyer returned Sea Dragon operations on 9 January. Problems with the forward gun turret and the starboard propeller saw Perth withdraw to Subic for repairs on 2 February. These were completed by 14 February, with the destroyer returning to the Sea Dragon force that day. The commanding officer of Perth was appointed overall commander of both {{the northern and southern}} task units; the northern unit was normally led by the commander of the assigned cruiser, but Newport News was in dock for maintenance. In mid-February, the forward gun mount malfunctioned again, which left the turret operational but unable to rotate. On 1 March, the destroyer withdrew for maintenance, returning to operations ten days later. On 23 March, Perth withdrew to Subic to conclude her tour of duty, and was replaced on 31 March by Hobart.|$|E

5000|$|Old Hickory Reservoir is [...] long lying between Nashville and Carthage. The {{reservoir}} {{is essentially}} a run-of-river type without regulating storage other than for incidental flood control through surcharge operation, and for pondage for power generation and lockages; hence, low water flow of the river will be increased only indirectly through the use and passage of discharges from upstream plants. Such releases, however, result in a more sufficient and higher quality of water for domestic and industrial consumption and use are effective in pollution abatement downstream. Due to the fairly constant level maintained under normal operating conditions, the reservoir is well suited for conservation and recreational purposes. Beginning in 2007, the multi-year altered flow and water temperatures resulting from the <b>emergency</b> <b>maintenance</b> on the Wolf Creek Dam affected Old Hickory like the other Cumberland River reservoirs and resulted in modifications about environmental management.|$|E
5000|$|The {{card punch}} had a maximum rate of 150 cards per minute. Timing was quite {{critical}} throughout {{the operation of}} the card punch, the card reader and the printer, all being based on electromechanical principles. The basic card punch mechanism was manufactured by Bull, a French company which owned patents on 80 column punch card machines. The machine came in two versions, the P147 and the P67, the main difference being electromagnetic clutch or a solenoid operated mechanical [...] "dog" [...] clutch to initiate a punch cycle. Since many gears, electrical contact cams were affixed to the main shaft with taper pins, the P 67 with its severe stopping dog clutch would cause timing loss more frequently than the P 147. Most <b>emergency</b> <b>maintenance</b> time was spent replacing worn and damaged taper pins and retiming the machine. The card punch had a preread station, a punch station and a checkread station. The machine could be quite difficult to maintain and required much skill to troubleshoot and maintain. The machine cycle was oddly divided into 420 [...] "points" [...] or [...] "Bull degrees".|$|E

50|$|It is cost {{effective}} to replace R-22 with R-407c before {{there is an}} <b>emergency.</b> Preventive <b>maintenance</b> programs should include strong suggestions to replace ozone-depleting refrigerants such as R-22 with environmentally friendly refrigerants {{and it seems that}} R-407c has become the front runner. There are many millions of tons of R-22 in air conditioning and refrigeration equipment in use today and most of it is destined to end up in the atmosphere in spite of efforts to curtail this probability.
