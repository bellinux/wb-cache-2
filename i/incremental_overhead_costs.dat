In addition, maintaining a good performance and quality of work away from possible loss. The purpose of the research is to examine the <b>overhead</b> <b>costs</b> management practice in the construction industry in the Gaza Strip. The awareness of construction companies and techniques followed by the contractors in estimating the <b>overhead</b> <b>costs,</b> affecting factors and mitigation measures was examined. A structured questionnaire supported by personal interviews was used to collect information. Sixty-three contracting companies working in the construction industry in the Gaza Strip were surveyed.

PT Kusumahadi Santosa’s manufacturing <b>overhead</b> <b>cost</b> data (primary data) is used to reach the purpose. PT Kusumahadi Santosa is the manufacturer that process threads into cloth materials. The result of this research as follows. PT Kusumahadi Santosa’s applied <b>overhead</b> <b>cost</b> base on predetermined overhead rates computes on the traditional costing (uses machine hours allocation base) is Rp 51. 324, 044, 510, 00, while those applied <b>overhead</b> <b>cost</b> based on predetermined overhead rates computes on ABC is Rp 53. 926. 959. 944, 00.

40|$|Earned Value Management (EVM) {{has been}} a {{well-known}} methodology used since the 1960 s when the US department of defense proposed a standard method to measure project perfor-mance. This system relies {{on a set of}} often straightforward metrics to measure and evaluate the general health of a project. These metrics serve as early warning signals to timely detect project problems, or to exploit project opportunities. A key aspect of EVM is to estimate the completion cost of a project by considering both cost and schedule performance indices. However, good performance of cost and schedule performance indices does not necessarily guarantee cost effec-tiveness of the project regardless of the <b>overhead</b> <b>costs.</b> The reason is because, in most project-based organizations, <b>overhead</b> <b>costs</b> constitute a significant proportion of the total costs.
