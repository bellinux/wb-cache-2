5|$|During this process, the <b>Home</b> <b>Office</b> {{declined}} to give Bamber the expert evidence it had obtained, so Bamber applied for judicial review of that decision in November 1994; this resulted in the <b>Home</b> <b>Office</b> handing over its expert evidence. In 1996, without informing Bamber or his lawyers, an Essex police officer destroyed many of the trial exhibits. He {{said he had not}} been aware that the case was ongoing.|$|E
5|$|In 1921 Walter Long of Gillingham, Dorset {{objected to}} the giant's nudity and {{conducted}} a campaign to either convert it to a simple nude, or to cover its supposed obscenity with a leaf. Long's protest gained some support, including that of two bishops, and eventually reached the <b>Home</b> <b>Office.</b> The <b>Home</b> <b>Office</b> considered the protest to be in humour, though the chief constable responded to say the office could not act against a protected scheduled monument.|$|E
5|$|Of {{concern to}} the <b>Home</b> <b>Office</b> were an {{undisclosed}} number of letters that it had received objecting to Colbung's involvement in the repatriation process; it therefore sought assurances from the Australian Government that Colbung was a correct applicant. In response Colbung asked his elders to ask the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) to tell the British <b>Home</b> <b>Office</b> {{that he was the}} correct applicant. ATSIC then convened a meeting in Perth at which it was again resolved that Colbung's application could proceed.|$|E

In 2011, the <b>Home</b> <b>Office</b> stopped using Norwich as a resettlement location in favour of locations in Yorkshire and Lancashire, reportedly to the disappointment of the local council.|$|E
5|$|A {{scene in}} the pre-title {{sequence}} was filmed during the same block as episodes three and four, which were directed by Sam Miller. The rest of the finale was filmed several weeks later. The inside of a surveillance van used in a few scenes were shot at a set {{right next to the}} Grid set; using a set would be more manageable for the filming crew. A military school in Belgravia was used to film two separate locations; the <b>Home</b> <b>Office</b> and Lindemann's office. Other scenes at the <b>Home</b> <b>Office</b> were filmed in a separate building in Roehampton.|$|E
5|$|David Bell, the <b>Home</b> <b>Office</b> negotiator, kept contradicting himself, {{as if in}} a bid {{to prolong}} the negotiations. He would agree to our terms, then he would try and tell us it was out of his hands, and go back on his word. If it was out of the Home Officer's hands—then whose hands was it in? I think the final stages were messed around by the <b>Home</b> <b>Office</b> so that our protest could help to divert the public's {{attention}} from the Poll Tax revolt that was going on throughout the country. As Alan Lord was snatched after being asked to negotiate on behalf of us all, this made us all more defiant about ending the protest.|$|E

A report of the survey was passed to the <b>Home</b> <b>Office,</b> prompting further discussions between the British and Australian Governments.|$|E
5|$|A further {{example of}} an {{executive}} decision invalidated by improper purpose {{can be seen from}} Congreve v. <b>Home</b> <b>Office</b> (1976). In that case, the Home Secretary, who had the power to revoke television licences, purported to revoke the licences of people who had pre-empted a rise in licence fees by buying a licence at the old rate before the date when the fees were due to go up, even though their old licences had not yet expired. The court held that this was an improper exercise of the Home Secretary's discretionary powers. His power to revoke could not be used to raise revenue, and therefore this power had been used for the wrong purpose.|$|E
5|$|A report {{into the}} {{experience}} of refugees resettled in Brighton and Hove under the scheme between October 2006 and October 2007 was published by the Sussex Centre for Migration Research at the University of Sussex in December 2007.

Another evaluation report undertaken for the <b>Home</b> <b>Office</b> and published in 2011 also found that only small numbers of resettled refugees were in paid employment, noting that many were still more concerned about meeting their basic needs.|$|E
