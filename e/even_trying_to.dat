The attack was repulsed as the walls of the city proved too strong and the garrison, presumably limitanei troops, too valorous. Nevertheless, the Germans had devastated a large area and taken vast amounts of booty.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} June 1775, Colonel Joseph Goreham {{had been ordered}} by General Thomas Gage to raise the Royal Fencible American Regiment of Foot and natives in Nova Scotia {{for the defense of}} the {{province}} against Patriot activity. Arriving at the fort in the summer of 1776, Colonel Goreham and a garrison of 200 Loyalist troops of the RFA did what they could to restore the premises to a defensible condition. But Goreham had not been adequately provisioned and his men lacked everything from victuals to uniforms. Furthermore, the locals were generally sympathetic to the Patriot cause, and refused to assist in rehabilitating the fort, <b>even</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> induce members of the garrison to defect.|$|E

As the first shooter, he couldn't {{show that he was}} {{deliberately}} trying to miss the opponent, because this was considered as a serious insult and could create a formal reason to appoint another duel. Instead, he tried to minimize his chances by shooting without precise aiming, from the maximal possible distance, not <b>even</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> come closer and get a clear shot.|$|E

He had countless jobs, <b>even</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> be a chicken farmer, but could never hold down a job and was constantly plagued by bad health. Additionally, letters from his family back in Germany explained that the Nazis still wanted to exact their revenge, leaving him {{in a constant state}} of fear. Sebold was diagnosed with manic depression and committed to Napa State Hospital in 1965. Five years later he suffered a heart attack and died.|$|E

Thomas {{returned}} to Bosnia in mid-January 1459 and took up {{the fight against the}} attackers, <b>even</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> eject them from Hodidjed.

25|$|The Herero {{entered into}} an {{alliance}} with the Germans, thinking they could get an upper hand on the Nama. The Germans set up a garrison at the Herero capital and started allocating Herero land for white settlements, including the best grazing land in the central plateau, and made tax and labor demands. The Herero and Ovambanderu rebelled, but the rebellion was crushed and leaders were executed. Between 1896 and 1897, rinderpest crippled the economic backbone of the Herero and Nama economy and slowed white expansion. The Germans continued the policy of making Namibia a white settlement by seizing land and cattle, and <b>even</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> export Herero labor to South Africa.|$|E
25|$|In series 2, another {{character}} was created, Gayle Shand, played by Tamsin Greig. Gayle {{was a former}} employee of Prentiss McCabe and Charles's former girlfriend, {{with whom she had}} a heavily sexual relationship (they often made love whilst listening to classical music). However, the relationship fell apart after Gayle told Charles that she was already married to an insect specialist from Philadelphia. She now runs a rival firm to Prentiss McCabe, which is a much larger company, and is often trying to win Archie's contract, or is the agent of a rival client to Prentiss McCabe's current one. For example, whilst Charles and Martin work for the PM via Archie, Gayle is the spin doctor for the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

25|$|The {{women and}} {{children}} were soon released from the Fellman camp and 13,000 Reds were moved to the Hennala camp. Most of them were men, but among the detainees were also more than 1,000 women and a smaller number of children. According to the past research, all women were released, but recent {{studies have shown that the}} Women's Red Guard fighters were systematically executed by the Whites and most likely sexually abused. At least 218 women were shot, the youngest being only 14-year-old girls. Total number of executed Reds was more than 500. The executions were carried out by the Finnish battalion led by the Estonian colonel Hans Kalm. The Germans shot only approximately 20–30 Reds during the Battle of Lahti but did not participate the later executions. In some cases they were <b>even</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> stop the Whites of executing their prisoners. The Germans usually robbed the killed as well as the captured Reds of their personal possessions. This was verified in the war diaries of the German officer Hans Tröbst, released as the sixth part of the 2015 book Der Krieg im Westen.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Slate, Sam Adams {{stated that}} Hawley's {{intention}} to deconstruct the superhero genre [...] "doesn’t {{seem like an}} accurate description of what the series is doing, or <b>even</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> do", calling the series [...] "a well-appointed show: It’s handsomely shot, and smartly acted, and ingeniously constructed enough to suggest there’s something mind-blowing lurking at its center ... it starts {{to feel like a}} show with a Rubik’s cube where its heart should be." [...] David Sims at The Atlantic called Legion [...] "the latest, and most indulgent, entrant" [...] in a trend of [...] "shows that rely far less on plot than on mood, that are crammed with stunning visuals and frustrating, circular dialogue." [...] Sims praised the series' style and Stevens' performance, but felt that [...] "it tries so hard to dazzle that it forgets to tell a meaningful story." [...] The Washington Posts Hank Stuever also questioned the need for another series where [...] "viewers find themselves trapped {{in the center of a}} tortured mind". Stuever had mixed feelings for the show overall, calling it [...] "beautifully made" [...] but asking, [...] "Must it always be the viewer’s job to pick up the pieces?" ...|$|E
500|$|Robert Bianco of USA Today was {{critical}} of the episode, writing [...] "It is possible [...] has worn out the Treehouse franchise. [...] three installments just seem to be reaching for jokes that aren't there, and falling in the attempt. [...] As you'd hope from The Simpsons, the segments all boast a few clever moments {{that will make you}} smile if not laugh. But they're not scary, they're not particularly funny, and outside of some tepid Twilight jokes, they're no longer <b>even</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> be real parodies of the original stories." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club also gave the episode a negative review, and felt that [...] "There were laughs in all three segments, but the episode as a whole left something to be desired. The first [...] eventually descended into a long string of mostly lame board game jokes, as if the writers had been coming up with board game puns for the last 15 seasons or something and wanted an excuse to unload a bunch of them all at once. The idea of Bart and Milhouse playing with a Ouija board ripoff was promising, so to see it descend into gags about Marge getting sucked into Clue was disappointing. There were fewer good gags [...] than in the board game segment, but it was balanced out by a fairly solid Hugh Laurie performance. Fortunately, the last segment, the inevitable Twilight parody, was funny across the board, both in how it took the piss out of the Twilight films and how it satirized vampire mania. [...] Still, it wasn't the best [...] "Treehouse" [...] ever, and you could make a good claim for it being the worst, particularly if the Twilight segment wasn't in there." ...|$|E

[...] A doctor in Dublin had diagnosed anaemia and prescribed iron and liver pills. The details of Wittgenstein's stay in America are recounted in Norman Malcolm's Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Memoir.

2500|$|Although {{violence}} between drug cartels had been occurring {{long before the}} war began, the government held a generally passive stance regarding cartel violence in the 1990s and early 2000s. That changed on December 11, 2006, when newly elected President Felipe Calderón sent 6,500 federal troops {{to the state of}} Michoacán to end drug violence there (Operation Michoacán). This action is regarded as the first major operation against organized crime, and is generally viewed as the starting point of the war {{between the government and the}} drug cartels. As time progressed, Calderón continued to escalate his anti-drug campaign, in which there are now about 45,000 troops involved in addition to state and federal police forces. In 2010 Calderón said that the cartels seek [...] "to replace the government" [...] and [...] "are trying to impose a monopoly by force of arms, and are <b>even</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> impose their own laws." ...|$|E

"Soon, {{with the}} {{composition}} of the musical illustrations for Pictures from an Exhibition by the architect Hartmann, he reached the acme of that musical radicalism, to whose 'new shores' and to whose 'unfathomed depths' the admirers of his 'Peepshows' and 'Savishnas' had pushed him so diligently. In music for these illustrations, as Mussorgsky called them, he represented , children, Baba Yaga in her wooden house on chicken legs, catacombs, gates, and even rattling carts. All this was not done jokingly, but 'seriously'.""There was no end to the enthusiasm shown by his devotees; but many of Mussorgsky's friends, on the other hand, and especially the comrade composers, were seriously puzzled and, listening to the 'novelty,' shook their heads in bewilderment. Naturally, Mussorgsky noticed their bewilderment and seemed to feel that he 'had gone too far.' He set the illustrations aside without <b>even</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> publish them.

2500|$|Before Proposition 218 became law, {{in a legal}} {{challenge}} to an assessment the courts reviewed {{the actions of the}} local agency under a highly deferential standard. [...] Under this highly deferential standard, the courts presumed that an assessment was valid and the person challenging the assessment had to show that the record before the local agency clearly did not support the underlying determinations of benefit and proportionality. [...] The underlying legal basis for the historical deferential standard of review was that the establishment of an assessment district takes place {{as a result of a}} peculiarly legislative process. [...] As a result, the constitutional separation of powers doctrine demanded a more deferential standard of review by the courts. [...] Property owners rarely won assessment lawsuits on the merits prior to Proposition 218.
