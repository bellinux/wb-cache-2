5|$|In Katherine Buetow's {{guide to}} the Australian Cattle Dog, Ian Dunbar {{makes the point that}} while people think of dog {{training}} as teaching a dog to sit, speak and roll over, the dog already <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> these things. Training, he says, involves teaching the dog that {{it is a good idea}} to do these things when a particular word is said or signal is given. He goes on to explain his belief that training is about opening communication channels, so that the dog knows what the handler wants it to do, and knows that it will be worth its while to do it. Consequences for the dog can be rewards for doing what is required, as recommended by Dunbar, or corrections where an unwanted behaviour is performed. Like other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is intelligent and responsive; both of these traits can be an advantage in training where a structured, varied program is used, but can lead to unwanted outcomes if training is not consistent, or is repetitive and boring for the dog. Stock dog trainer Scott Lithgow recommends making training a game so the Cattle Dog learns that obedience leads to enjoyment. Many of a Cattle Dog's natural behaviours are undesirable in a pet: barking, chewing, chasing, digging, defending territory, and nipping heels. Training, therefore, involves helping the dog adopt a lifestyle that is probably very different from that of its droving ancestors. The Australian Cattle Dog is biddable, and responds well to training.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{win against}} Matthysse, {{negotiations}} {{for a fight}} against Kaizer Mabuza began. Both sides eventually agreed to a March 5 bout, with the vacant IBF Light Welterweight title on the line. Former champion Pernell Whitaker joined Judah's training camp to help him prepare for the match. Whitaker said: [...] "I don't train guys to be like me. I help guys {{to do the things}} that work for them. If I can teach you how to hit and not get hit, that's a blessing for you. Zab has the same abilities I have, but Zab still has to put it together and do it the way that Zab <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it." [...] On March 5, 2011, Judah defeated Mabuza via technical knockout in the seventh round, at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, claiming the IBF title again after almost ten years.|$|E
500|$|Digital Spy writer Catriona Wightman {{found the}} episode [...] "completely absurd" [...] but [...] "brillantly entertaining." [...] Morgan Glennon of BuddyTV wrote, [...] "Despite how ridiculous it was seeing {{character}} after character after character {{try to save}} Blair from her own stupid decisions, Gossip Girl really <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> big events. After 100 episodes, the show understood that it needed to go big to top off the royal wedding storyline. So the wedding, and attendant quest to stop it, was as big, dramatic and heartfelt as Gossip Girl at its best." [...] Glennon also conceded about the Gossip Girl reveal, the show can still pull out those OMG moments. Glennon found Georgina [...] "amazing" [...] in the episode, [...] "you can't even take your eyes off her because she's so great in every scene." [...] However, The Atlantic Wire thought the writers [...] "should have waited until the last-ever episode to do the unveiling" [...] of Gossip Girl and questioned, [...] "isn't that indicative of the show's greater failings over these past {{four and a half}} years? That constant need of this once-promising show to tip its hand too soon?" [...] and concluded [...] "we think the time has finally come to remove Gossip Girl from our bookmarks." ...|$|E

500|$|Ray Boren from Deseret News was {{impressed}} with Madonna's vocals, calling them [...] "sultry" [...] and [...] "cutesy", listing [...] "Vogue" [...] and [...] "Something to Remember" [...] as highlights. Greg Sandow of Entertainment Weekly gave I'm Breathless an A rating, praising Madonna for [...] "invent a new Broadway vocal persona, built around a chest voice not yet perfectly under control but still much richer and duskier than her low range sounded before." [...] Robert Christgau from The Village Voice said the record's [...] "show-tune-pop-shlock" [...] suits Madonna [...] "with its pedigree of wit and musicality", as does the music's campiness, which she [...] "sure <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> right". He listed [...] "Cry Baby", [...] "He's a Man" [...] and [...] "Hanky Panky" [...] as the best tracks. Mark Coleman from Rolling Stone gave the album a rating of three-and-a-half out of five stars and positive review, claiming that Madonna [...] "pulls it off with brass and panache". He added that [...] "Vogue" [...] showed the singer [...] "can still deliver that indefinable something extra". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine gave it {{four out of five}} stars, declaring: [...] "I'm Breathless proves that Madonna is a true renaissance woman".|$|E
500|$|Since {{the early}} 1960s, the U.S. has safely {{conducted}} more than 3,000 shipments of {{spent nuclear fuel}} without any harmful release of radioactive material. This safety record {{is comparable to the}} worldwide experience where more than 70,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel have been transported since 1970 – an amount approximately equal to the total amount of spent nuclear fuel that would have been shipped to Yucca Mountain. However, cities were still concerned about the transport of radioactive waste on highways and railroads that may have passed through heavily populated areas. Dr. Robert Halstead, who was a transportation adviser to the state of Nevada since 1988, stated regarding transportation of the high level waste, [...] "They would heavily affect cities like Buffalo, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, in the Chicago metropolitan area, in Omaha." [...] "Coming out of the south, the heaviest impacts would be in Atlanta, in Nashville, St. Louis, Kansas City, moving across through Salt Lake City, through downtown Las Vegas, up to Yucca Mountain. And the same cities would be affected by rail shipments as well." [...] Spencer Abraham (DOE) on the other hand has stated, [...] "I think there's a general understanding that we move hazardous materials in this country, an understanding that the federal government <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it safely." ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{not clear}} whether the Department of State or Lodge was {{enthusiastic}} about the political change in Saigon at the time, but if they were not, they were handed a fait accompli. A CIA report from Saigon soon after the seizure of power told the State Department that [...] "It {{is safe to say that}} Khánh's group will be essentially pro-American, anti-communist and anti-neutralist in general orientation." [...] As far as Harkins was concerned, with US policy committed to maintaining leadership in the hands of senior military officers, there were no other apparent options; he told General Taylor, [...] "One thing is for sure with this coup. We've gone through all the eligible general officers." [...] For his part, Lodge chose not to warn the junta, to which the embassy had pledged their support, as to the imminent plot, despite being well aware of it. He said in a cable a few days after the coup that [...] "General Khánh's coup was extremely disconcerting at first blush", but that the lack of public reaction to the overthrow of Minh indicated that Khánh's actions were not something to be alarmed about. He wrote that the progress of history was often made in many phases by different individuals or groups, using the analogy that in an American political party, the people who manage the primary campaigns are different from those who run the national elections, while the officer-holders are entirely separate. Lodge speculated that while Minh and his generals were successful in removing Diệm—something Lodge strongly encouraged—they may not be the ideal administrators of a nation themselves. With respect to the prospects of defeating the communists, he said [...] "Our side <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it; we have the means with which to do it; we simply need to do it. This requires a tough and ruthless commander. Perhaps Khánh is it." [...] Blair said that Lodge's habit of looking for American parallels to Vietnamese situations hindered his judgment, pointing out that Khánh's rule merely saw more instability and chaos. At the end of February, Lodge was still positive and cabled Washington to say that [...] "I continue to be favorably impressed by him. He is really very much more able than the Minh, Don, Kim group and, of course, he is so far above Diệm and Nhu that there is no comparison." ...|$|E

[...] Emily Yahr of The Washington Post retrospectively called the second instalment [...] "Pretty much a perfect season of television". Viewers were concerned that the show would suffer when Rory left for college after season 3, and Yahr commented that the show was not [...] "the same" [...] from this point but gave seasons four and five a positive 7/10.|$|E
2500|$|At the time, Fătu also {{functioned as}} one of Iași's head {{physicians}} and curator (epitrop) of Sfântul Spiridon Hospital, publishing in 1873 {{a report on the}} foundation, its furnishings, and its work. This activity of his was coming under scrutiny from Junimea. The club's doyen, Titu Maiorescu, noted in 1875 that most of Fătu's contributions were not fully philanthropic, as he claimed and expected others to perform: [...] "To work for money only, now there is something Dr. Fătu <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> with those 2,800 francs he picks up at the botanical garden, and a similar sum from the Academic Society, and so much more from Sfântul Spiridon etc., and then he presents himself as a great patriot." [...] Ultimately, in 1876, with Ion Ghica taking over as Academy chairman, Fătu was also replaced as vice president by George Bariț. In July of that year, selected by Poni and voted in by other inductees, he became a [...] "special member" [...] of the Medical and Naturalist Society, charged with curating its botanical fund.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the novel, Dorothy is swept from her farm to Oz by a cyclone, which was frequently compared to the Free Silver movement in Baum's time. The yellow brick road represents the gold standard, and the Silver Shoes, which enable Dorothy to travel more comfortably, symbolizes the Populist Party's desire to construct a bimetallic standard of both gold and silver in place of the gold standard. [...] "Oz" [...] is the abbreviated form of ounce, a standard measure of gold. When Dorothy and the Scarecrow walk through the forest, the road begins to be rough and patchy, causing the Scarecrow to trip and fall numerous times. The Scarecrow's falls on the yellow brick road resemble the damage farmers faced owing to deflation caused by the scarcity of gold. Dorothy, however, simply [...] "walks around" [...] the holes in the road, showing that the bimetallic standard works. Even when gold was scarce, the other metal in the bimetal system would be relatively cheap, therefore one bypasses deflation. Throughout the book, most of the characters do not know the magic behind the silver shoes. It is not until Dorothy meets Glinda, the good Witch of the South, that she finds out that the silver shoes have had the power to transfer her back to Kansas all along. Baum is possibly alluding {{to the fact that the}} bimetallic standard has been a working solution to the economic crisis all along, though no one <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. Once Dorothy clicks her heels three times, she returns to Kansas, where she realizes that [...] "The Silver Shoes had fallen off in her flight through the air, and were lost forever in the desert." [...] The silver shoes were lost, much like the fight for the bimetallic standard, which began to fade away in 1900.|$|E
