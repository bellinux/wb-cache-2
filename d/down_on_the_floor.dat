Chambers noticed that the air conditioning had been left on, something that Williamson was unlikely to have done, and then realised that Williamson's bedroom door had been left ajar.

5|$|The tournament final between A.J. Styles and Samoa Joe {{took place}} on August14 at Sacrifice. As Styles laid against the ring ropes at the {{beginning}} of the match, Joe ran across the ring and kicked him in the face, causing him to fly out of the ring and crash <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> Joe followed by diving through the ring ropes and smashing Styles in the face with his forearm as Styles reached his feet. Joe later held Styles in an STF submission hold, which he was forced to release when Styles touched the bottom rope. Styles then gained the advantage with a dropkick and front-flip splash from the ring ropes. He held Joe on his shoulders before twisting him off into a powerbomb, or what he calls a Rack Bomb. During the move, referee Andrew Thomas was kicked in the face and knocked unconscious, allowing Daniels to interfere in the contest. Daniels attacked Styles and attempted to hit Joe with the X Division Title belt before Styles threw Daniels from the ring. Joe followed by lifting Styles up and performing his Muscle Buster maneuver, then placing Styles in his Coquina Clutch submission hold. Styles submitted to the move as the referee came to, giving the victory to Joe. The final bout lasted 15 minutes and 15 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a shot of Minogue posing in a dark room, dressed in a {{sparkling}} costume on which rainbow-lighting is projected. She is then shown {{in front of a}} wall wearing a flowing maroon dress. As the intro ends and the first verse commences, Minogue appears in a hall and performs various dance routine with numerous female dancers clad in nude bodysuits. The singer's attire consists of a pleated red organza dress designed by Austrian fashion designer Helmut Lang (in 2006, Minogue donated this costume to the Arts Centre Melbourne museum, where it is displayed in the Kylie Minogue Collection). Shots of the dancers in kaleidoscopic arrangements are intercut. A few seconds later, Minogue and a man dance together alone in a hall. Their dance ends with the man slowly laying Minogue <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> and leaving. Twelve women in golden and pastel pink dresses are seen dancing on a dark brown floor, which is revealed to be Minogue's hat as the camera pans out. She proceeds to wave to a distant person and then plucks the petals out of a pink rose she is holding. The rest of the video randomly intersperses all of the previous scenes.|$|E

For half the session the mother gets <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> with the infant, observes it and interacts only on the infant's initiative. The idea is that it increases the mother's sensitivity and responsiveness by fostering an observational reflective stance, whilst also being physically accessible. Also the infant has the experience of negotiating their relationship with their mother. For the second half the mother discusses her observations and experiences.|$|E

25|$|As {{the fire}} raged outside the mine, the heat caused {{the cold air}} in the tunnel to rush out, {{replacing}} it with hot air and smoke. Pulaski ordered the men to lie <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of the mine where there was still some breathable air. As the fire closed in around the tunnel entrance, timber beams {{at the mouth of}} the tunnel began to burn. Pulaski carried water in his hat from pools on the mine floor to the entrance, trying to douse the flames. In the process, he was badly burned. Eventually, Pulaski fell unconscious, as did all his men.|$|E

Terry Funk, Pat O'Connor and Lou Thesz were the special judges in the match in case the match went to the full 1-hour time limit. Flair started the match by performing a Shoulder Block. Flair and Steamboat competed for longer than half hour and exchanged momentum throughout the match. In the final moments of the match, Steamboat delivered a Superplex to Flair and applied a Double Chickenwing but Flair wrapped his legs into the ropes. Flair was smashed into the turnbuckle and Steamboat climbed the top rope. Flair fell into the ropes and Steamboat fell <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> which hurt his leg. Flair suplexed Steamboat back into the ring and began attacking his injured knee. Flair applied a Figure Four Leglock until Steamboat caught the ropes. Flair tried to attack Steamboat's knee but Steamboat delivered a Karate Chop and an Enzuigiri. Steamboat tried to pick Flair to perform a Scoop Slam but his leg was hurt, allowing Flair to pin Steamboat with an Inside Cradle to win the title. After the match, Flair showed respect to Steamboat by shaking hands with him. One of the judges of the match, Terry Funk challenged Flair for the title but Flair turned down the title match, causing Funk to attack Flair and perform a Piledriver on him through the judges table.|$|E

60|$|The best {{of these}} mosaics were taken up and removed to the museum.
