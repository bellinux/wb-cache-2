25|$|The TEC Awards nominating panel {{may choose}} to honor a number of {{pioneering}} or innovative audio products with induction into the TECnology Hall of Fame. A product must be ten years old to receive the honor. At the establishment of this award category at the AES Convention in San Francisco in October 2004, the initial 25 inductees included the venerable Edison cylinder (1877), Emile Berliner's flat <b>disc</b> <b>recorder</b> (1887), and Alan Dower Blumlein Stereo Patent (1931).|$|E
500|$|Reznor {{collaborated with}} former Jane's Addiction and Porno for Pyros drummer Stephen Perkins, {{progressive}} rock guitarist Adrian Belew, and Nine Inch Nails drummer Chris Vrenna. Belew's {{first visit to}} the studio involved playing the guitar parts in [...] "Mr. Self-Destruct", and he was told to play freely, think on reacting to melodies, concentrate on rhythm, and use noise. This approach improved Reznor's confidence in the instrument: he found it to be more expressive than the keyboard due to the interface. Belew praised Reznor for his [...] "command of technology," [...] and commented that the music of Nine Inch Nails made innovations [...] "that are in [...] realm." [...] Vrenna and Perkins played drum parts recorded live in the studio; the tracks were rendered into looped samples. Reznor took a similar approach to recording guitar parts: he would tape 20- to 25-minute-long sessions of himself playing guitars on a hard <b>disc</b> <b>recorder</b> with the Studio Vision sequencer.|$|E

Gordon had also experimented in the field with a portable <b>disc</b> <b>recorder,</b> but had had neither time nor resources to do significant fieldwork. Lomax found the recorded holdings of the Archive woefully inadequate for his purposes. He therefore made an arrangement with the Library whereby it would provide recording equipment, obtained for it by Lomax through private grants, in exchange for which he would travel the country making field recordings to be deposited in the Archive of the Library, then the major resource for printed and recorded material in the United States ...|$|E

Our extension to Japanese broadcast music video programs consists of detecting audio segment boundaries such as conversations with guests followed by music/song etc. Our proposed system first identifies the music/song scenes using audio analysis, and then adjusts the start/end position by detecting video shot changes, {{so as to}} achieve accurate detection of the music segment thus enabling rapid browsing. Our preliminary results indicate that our audio-only summarization with scene change support works well for music video content. We can therefore integrate the enhancement into our product at a low computational cost...|$|R

50|$|There {{was some}} home {{recording}} of radio broadcasts in the 1930s and 1940s. Examples from {{as early as}} 1930 have been documented. During these years, home recordings were made with <b>disc</b> <b>recorders,</b> {{most of which were}} only capable of storing about four minutes of a radio program on each side of a twelve-inch 78 rpm record. Most home recordings were made on even shorter-playing ten-inch or smaller discs. Some home <b>disc</b> <b>recorders</b> offered the option of the 33 rpm speed used for electrical transcriptions, allowing a recording more than twice as long to be made, although with reduced audio quality. Office dictation equipment was sometimes pressed into service for making recordings of radio broadcasts, but the audio quality of these devices was poor and the resulting recordings were in odd formats which had to be played back on similar equipment. Due to the expense of recorders and the limitations of the recording media, home recording of broadcasts was not common during this period and it was usually limited to brief excerpts.|$|R

50|$|These {{improved}} wire recorders {{were not}} only marketed for office use, but also as home entertainment devices that offered advantages over the home <b>disc</b> <b>recorders</b> which were becoming increasingly popular for making short recordings {{of family and friends}} and for recording excerpts from radio broadcasts. Unlike home-cut phonograph records, which can accommodate only a few minutes of audio on each side, the steel wire can be repeatedly rerecorded and allowed much longer uninterrupted recordings to be made.|$|R

5000|$|Around 1940, <b>disc</b> <b>recorders</b> {{designed}} for amateur home use began {{appearing on the}} market, but their high prices limited sales and then World War II brought their production to a halt. After the war, the popularity of such recorders greatly increased. Countless discs were cut at parties and family gatherings, both for immediate amusement value and to preserve audio [...] "snapshots" [...] of these events and of the voices of relatives and friends. Schoolchildren and adults alike used them to practice speeches, amateur musical efforts were immortalized, and snippets of radio broadcasts were captured, all limited by the three- or four-minute maximum playing time of the 78 rpm large-groove format which was still standard for all home-use records.|$|R

50|$|During {{the very}} early tape era, around 1950, acetate discs and {{portable}} <b>disc</b> <b>recorders</b> competed with magnetic tape as a location-recording medium, both for broadcast and semi-pro use, but tape's several advantages quickly won the contest. Recording services hired to record weddings and other private events routinely captured them on tape, but because most homes of the 1950s and early 1960s were not equipped to play tapes, while nearly everyone had a record player, typically the recording was dubbed to disc and supplied to the client in that form and the original tape was recycled. Acetate discs are inherently less durable than some types of magnetic tape, and have the disadvantage of not being physically editable—unlike tape, they cannot be cut and spliced.|$|R
50|$|Mass {{storage devices}} store {{programs}} and data {{even when the}} power is off; they do require power to perform read and write functions during usage. Although flash memory has dropped in cost, the prevailing form of mass storage in personal computers is still the hard disk drive. If the mass storage controller provides additional ports for expandability, a PC may also be upgraded {{by the addition of}} extra hard disk or optical disc drives. For example, BD-ROMs, DVD-RWs, and various optical <b>disc</b> <b>recorders</b> may all be added by the user to certain PCs. Standard internal storage device connection interfaces are PATA, Serial ATA and SCSI. Solid state drives (SSDs) are a much faster replacement for traditional mechanical hard disk drives, but are also more expensive in terms of cost per gigabyte.|$|R
