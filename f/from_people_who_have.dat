Andrew Miller of The Pitch stated [...] " [...] at Sandstone proved that many [...] criticisms are off-base observations <b>from</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> never actually attended {{one of these}} stars' shows. The music came from a talented band, not a DAT, and the bass lines to such songs as [...] "... Baby One More Time" [...] and [...] "The Beat Goes On" [...] rose to a funky growl in the live setting. For another, Spears' vocals were the real thing, as she sang in an alluringly low tone [...] but capably hit the high notes , however, she left the upper-octave duties to her background singers [...] during Spears' most strenuous dance routines". Richard Leiby of The Washington Post believed that the show [...] " [...] great". Dan Aquilante of the New York Post said that Spears [...] "seemed to be enjoying the show as much as her fans. Maybe it was the Mariah-like cowboy hat pushed back on her noggin or possibly the stripper's pole borrowed from Madonna's prop closet, [...] Spears was in her element and having a ball". Letta Tayler of Newsday said [...] "For half the show, she remained the old Britney, the budding teen who dreamed of romance. But {{the rest of the}} time, she was a full-throttle tease, with sprayed- on clothes, a hard-edged attitude and a harder edge to her techno and hip-hop- coated pop to match".|$|E
