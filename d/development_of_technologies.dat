25|$|Columbus, {{the primary}} {{research}} facility for European payloads aboard the ISS, provides a generic laboratory {{as well as}} facilities specifically designed for biology, biomedical research and fluid physics. Several mounting locations are affixed to {{the exterior of the}} module, which provide power and data to external experiments such as the European Technology Exposure Facility (EuTEF), Solar Monitoring Observatory, Materials International Space Station Experiment, and Atomic Clock Ensemble in Space. A number of expansions are planned for the module to study quantum physics and cosmology. ESA's <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>technologies</b> on all the main areas of life support has been ongoing for more than 20 years and are/have been used in modules such as Columbus and the ATV. The German Aerospace Center DLR manages ground control operations for Columbus and the ATV is controlled from the French CNES Toulouse Space Center.|$|E
25|$|The {{precursor}} sciences to {{the development}} of modern computer graphics were the advances in electrical engineering, electronics, and television that took place {{during the first half of}} the twentieth century. Screens could display art since the Lumiere brothers' use of mattes to create special effects for the earliest films dating from 1895, but such displays were limited and not interactive. The first cathode ray tube, the Braun tube, was invented in 1897 - it in turn would permit the oscilloscope and the military control panel - the more direct precursors of the field, as they provided the first two-dimensional electronic displays that responded to programmatic or user input. Nevertheless, computer graphics remained relatively unknown as a discipline until the 1950s and the post-World War II period - during which time the discipline emerged from a combination of both pure university and laboratory academic research into more advanced computers and the United States military's further <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>technologies</b> like radar, advanced aviation, and rocketry developed during the war. New kinds of displays were needed to process the wealth of information resulting from such projects, leading {{to the development}} of computer graphics as a discipline.|$|E

2500|$|The Constellation Program (abbreviated CxP) was a manned spaceflight program {{developed}} by NASA, {{the space agency}} of the United States, from 2005 to 2009.

The program's logo reflected the three stages of the program: the Earth (ISS), the Moon, and finally Mars—while the Mars goal also found expression in the name given to the program's booster rockets: Ares (The Greek equivalent of the Roman god Mars). The technological aims of the program included the regaining of significant astronaut experience beyond low Earth orbit and the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>technologies</b> necessary to enable sustained human presence on other planetary bodies.|$|E
