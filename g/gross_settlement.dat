25|$|The Payment Systems and Netting Act 1998 {{gives the}} board power {{in areas of}} the law that were {{previously}} uncertain. It removed the zero hour rule that allowed a bankruptcy to date a bankruptcy the previous midnight and the Act made it so payments the same day could not be undone. Before the removal of the zero hour rule, the Real Time <b>Gross</b> <b>Settlement</b> system had been violated because payments in the system should inherently not be reversed. Some payments systems had previously agreed to pay and receive obligations to the whole system, rather than merely maintaining their own. But {{in the event of a}} bankruptcy, the bankrupt institution did not pay what it owed back to the solvent parties, while they had to pay their dues to the failed bank. This was later changed, when cheques were deemed void if the bankrupt institution doesn't have the funds to back them up, after the Cheques Act 1986 was amended in 1998. The Trade Practices Act 1974 generally does not allow competitors to make cooperative agreements, but if the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is permitted to make exceptions for competitors making agreements among themselves.

40|$|Path-based {{transaction}} (PBT) networks, which settle {{payments from}} one user to another via {{a path of}} intermediaries, are a growing area of research. They overcome the scalability and privacy issues in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum by replacing expensive and slow on-chain blockchain operations with inexpensive and fast off-chain transfers. In the form of credit networks such as Ripple and Stellar, they also enable low-price real-time <b>gross</b> <b>settlements</b> across different currencies. For example, SilentWhsipers is a recently proposed fully distributed credit network relying on path-based transactions for secure and in particular private payments without a public ledger. At {{the core of a}} decentralized PBT network is a routing algorithm that discovers transaction paths between payer and payee. During the last year, a number of routing algorithms have been proposed. However, the existing ad hoc efforts lack either efficiency or privacy. In this work, we first identify several efficiency concerns in SilentWhsipers. Armed with this knowledge, we design and evaluate SpeedyMurmurs, a novel routing algorithm for decentralized PBT networks using efficient and flexible embedding-based path discovery and on-demand efficient stabilization to handle the dynamics of a PBT network. Our simulation study, based on real-world data from the currently deployed Ripple credit network, indicates that SpeedyMurmurs reduces the overhead of stabilization by up to two orders of magnitude and the overhead of routing a transaction by more than a factor of two. Furthermore, using SpeedyMurmurs maintains at least the same success ratio as decentralized landmark routing, while providing lower delays. Finally, SpeedyMurmurs achieves key privacy goals for routing in PBT networks. Comment: 15 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
50|$|RTGS {{system does}} not require any {{physical}} exchange of money; the central bank makes adjustments in the electronic accounts of Bank A and Bank B, reducing the balance in Bank A's account by the amount in question and increasing the balance of Bank B's account by the same amount. The RTGS system is suited for low-volume, high-value transactions. It lowers settlement risk, besides giving an accurate picture of an institution's account at any point of time. The objective of RTGS systems by central banks throughout the world is to minimize risk in high-value electronic payment settlement systems. In an RTGS system, transactions are settled across accounts held at a central bank on a continuous <b>gross</b> basis. <b>Settlement</b> is immediate, final and irrevocable. Credit risks due to settlement lags are eliminated. The best RTGS national payment system cover up to 95% of high-value transactions within the national monetary market.|$|R

Although in most industrial countries different interbank payment systems coexist, little is really known about their properties in terms of risk and efficiency. How should payment systems be designed? We tackle this question by comparing the two main types of payment systems, gross and net, in a framework where uncertainty arises from several sources: the time of consumption, the location of consumption, and the return on investment. Payments across locations can be made either by directly transferring liquidity or by transferring claims against the bank in the other location. The two mechanisms are interpreted as the <b>gross</b> and net <b>settlement</b> systems in interbank payments. We characterize the equilibria in the two systems and identify the trade-off in terms of safety and efficiency...|$|R

40|$|The {{infrastructure}} for securities {{clearing and settlement}} in the euro area is currently being shaped. While, {{in the field of}} payment systems, the TARGET system allows for the real-time transfer of cash between any of the 5, 000 participants throughout the European Union, the {{infrastructure for}} securities settlement is fragmented in a multiplicity of systems which is hindering the integration of the euro area financial markets. As a result, it is no easier for a euro area bank to settle trades denominated in euro than in other currencies. The introduction of the euro has triggered the consolidation of these systems, as a result either of mergers, alliances or links. The emergence of Clearstream (merger between Cedel and DBC), the agreed merger between Euroclear and Sicovam; the alliance SEGA-CREST, the agreement between Clearnet and London Clearing House and the merger between the Amsterdam, Brussels and Paris stock exchanges are important steps towards the consolidation of the industry. The aim of this note is to present a set of issues of debate in the field of securities settlement. The outcome of these issues will define the future securities clearing and settlement infrastructure of the euro area. In Section 1 the note evaluates the merits of both <b>gross</b> and net <b>settlement</b> systems.

40|$|Since Friedrich Hayek, {{debates about}} the proper {{relationship}} {{between the state and}} the market, and about the optimal design of regulatory institutions, often turn on assumptions about the workings of legal expertise — and in particular about the difference between public expertise (bureaucratic knowledge) and private expertise (private law). Hayek’s central argument, adopted uncritically by a wide array of policy-makers and academics across the political spectrum, is a temporal one: bureaucratic reasoning is inherently one step behind the market, and hence effective market planning is impossible. In contrast, Hayek argues, private ordering is superior because it is of the moment, happening in real time. My research suggests that Hayek’s description of the limitations of bureaucratic planning resonates with the sense of powerlessness and frustration experienced by many government officials themselves as they attempt to manage economic fluctuations. But Hayek’s rich (and even empathetic) account of the limits of well-meaning public legal expertise is far less complete when it comes to the strengths of private legal reasoning. Public reasoning has temporal weaknesses, so private reasoning must have equivalent temporal strengths, the argument goes. This chapter from a forthcoming book, Collateral Knowledge: Legal Reasoning in the Global Financial Markets, takes on Hayekian arguments against government regulation through a detailed examination of real-world examples of how public and private legal technologies manage the temporal dimensions of risk in the over-the-counter derivatives markets. It draws upon over ten years of fieldwork conducted among regulators and market participants involved in the global derivatives markets in Japan. The specific examples are: the usage of collateral on the private law side, and the usage of “real time <b>gross</b> settlement” payment <b>settlement</b> systems on the public side. My research shows that while there is no reason to believe that either of these is actually more effective than the other as a stop-gap against future uncertainties in the market, there is nevertheless a kind of “Hayekian” perception, by market participants and government officials alike, that the private devices are more legitimate, and that the experts who deploy these are more knowledgeable, more expert. In order to understand the root of this legitimacy gap, the paper explores in detail how collateral, as a private legal technology, handles the temporal uncertainties surrounding market risk. At the heart of “collateral” is a deceptively mundane, but actually quite audacious legal trick called the legal fiction. In legal terms, a legal fiction is a statement that is consciously understood to be false, and hence is irrefutable. An example would be the statement that “a corporation is a person”. Collateral is actually just a set of legal fictions, layered one on top of another. I explain how these fictions — which are just as problematically related to market “realities” as government planning technologies — nevertheless come to be much more readily accepted predictors, and indeed creators of market realities. So does this mean that private regulation is inherently superior to public regulation? The fallacy of the Hayekian argument is the assumption that these “private” technologies can only be deployed by private actors. In fact, there is nothing inherently private or public about the legal fiction or other similar devices of private law. The paper demonstrates this by showing how financial regulators in Japan redeployed the trick of the legal fiction and hence regained legitimacy in their own eyes and in the eyes of market participants...|$|R
