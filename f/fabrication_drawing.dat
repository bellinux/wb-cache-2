40|$|Industrialization creates new {{requirements}} for design. Designers {{need to consider}} not only building performance, but also production plan needs.

40|$|Fibre {{drawing is}} used to {{fabricate}} indefinite media based on wire array metamaterials. Fibres containing arrays of indium wires embedded in polymer are drawn using an optical fibre draw tower, a technique that is intrinsically scalable to larger-volume <b>fabrication.</b> During <b>drawing,</b> the surface tension of the liquid indium can result in fluctuations to the wire diameter through the Plateau–Rayleigh instability. This is investigated and minimised through a modification of the draw process to achieve wire diameters as low as 1 micrometer.

40|$|Two commercially {{available}} silver inks were inkjet printed to fabricate the seed tracks (seed layers) of radio frequency (RF) circuit structures {{on a high}} frequency substrate material. One {{of them is a}} nanoparticle based ink, and the other, a non-particle based organic silver complex ink.

30|$|Ultraviolet (UV) {{detectors}} play {{an essential}} role {{in a wide range of}} civil and military applications including UV astronomy, environmental monitoring, flame sensing, secure space-to-space communications, and chemical/biological analysis[1 – 3]. As a wide bandgap material, ZnO has emerged as one of the most promising materials for UV detectors due to its exceptional photosensitivity and high radiation hardness[4 – 6]. ZnO has a direct wide bandgap of 3.37 eV, eliminating the need for costly filters to achieve visible-blind operation as that in traditional photomultipliers and silicon photodetectors. Its bandgap can be tuned in a wide range simply by doping with a small mole fraction of Al, Mg, or Cd, which enables ZnO to be used in different detection ranges. In the past, most ZnO-based photodetectors were fabricated in planar type based on ZnO thin films grown by sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, or molecular beam epitaxy. Different kinds of UV detectors based on ZnO have been investigated with metal-semiconductor-metal[7 – 10], p-i-n[4, 11, 12], p-n junction[5, 13, 14], or Schottky barrier-type[15 – 17] structures.

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{elements}} in point-of-care (POC) diagnostic test instrumentation is the optical system required for signal detection and / or imaging. Many tests which use fluorescence, absorbance, or colorimetric optical signals are under development for management of infectious diseases in resource limited settings, where the overall size and cost of the device is of critical importance. At present, high-performance lenses are expensive to fabricate and difficult to obtain commercially, presenting barriers for developers of in vitro POC tests or microscopic image-based diagnostics. We recently described a compact “hybrid” objective lens incorporating both glass and plastic optical elements, with a numerical aperture of 1. 0 and field-of-view of 250 μm. This design concept may potentially enable mass-production of high-performance, low-cost optical systems which can be easily incorporated in the readout path of existing and emerging POC diagnostic assays. In this paper, we evaluate the biological imaging performance of these lens systems in three broad POC diagnostic application areas; (1) bright field microscopy of histopathology slides, (2) cytologic examination of blood smears, and (3) immunofluorescence imaging. We also break down the <b>fabrication</b> costs and <b>draw</b> comparisons with other miniature optical systems. The hybrid lenses provided images with quality comparable to conventional microscopy, enabling examination of neoplastic pathology and infectious parasites including malaria and cryptosporidium. We describe how these components can be produced at below $ 10 per unit in full-scale production quantities, making these systems well suited for use within POC diagnostic instrumentation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} for {{the first}} time the <b>fabrication</b> of pencil <b>drawn</b> electrodes (PDE) on paper platforms for capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detection ((CD) -D- 4) on electrophoresis microchips. PDE-(CD) -D- 4 devices were attached on PMMA electrophoresis chips and used for detection of K+ and Na+ in human tear samples. PDE-(CD) -D- 4 devices were produced on office paper and chromatographic paper platforms and their performance were thoroughly investigated using a model mixture containing K+, Na+, and Li+. In comparison with chromatographic paper, PDE-(CD) -D- 4 fabricated on office paper has exhibited better performance due to its higher electrical conductivity. Furthermore, the detector response was similar to that recorded with electrodes prepared with copper adhesive tape. The fabrication of PDE-(CD) -D- 4 on office paper has offered great advantages including extremely low cost (< $ 0. 004 per unit), reduced fabrication time (< 5 min), and minimal instrumentation (pencil and paper). The proposed electrodes demonstrated excellent analytical performance with good reproducibility. For an inter-PDE comparison (n = 7), the RSD values for migration time, peak area, and separation efficiency were lower than 2. 5, 10. 5, and 14 %, respectively. The LOD's achieved for K+, Na+, and Li+ were 4. 9, 6. 8, and 9. 0 M, respectively. The clinical feasibility of the proposed approach was successfully demonstrated with the quantitative analysis of K+ and Na+ in tear samples.

Now, in the post digital age, the age of digital <b>fabrication,</b> boundaries between <b>drawing</b> and making, between the designer and the maker, have dissolved.   Consequently sixteen*(makers) work is now engaged with questions of knowledge transfer, expertise, and innovation where modes of investigation are equally embedded within in the analogue and the digital world.

40|$|Drawing of {{standard}} telecommunication-type optical fibres has been optimised {{in terms of}} optical and physical properties. Specialty fibres, however, typically have more complex dopant profiles. Designs with high dopant concentrations and multidoping are common, making control of the fabrication process particularly important. In photonic crystal fibres (PCF) the inclusion of air-structures imposes a new challenge for the drawing process. The {{aim of this study}} is to gain profound insight into the behaviour of complex optical fibre structures during the final <b>fabrication</b> step, fibre <b>drawing.</b> Two types of optical fibre, namely conventional silica fibres and PCFs, were studied. Germanium and fluorine diffusion during drawing was studied experimentally and a numerical analysis was performed of the effects of drawing parameters on diffusion. An experimental study of geometry control of PCFs during drawing was conducted with emphasis given to the control of hole size. The effects of the various drawing parameters and their suitability for controlling the air-structure was studied. The effect of air-structures on heat transfer in PCFs was studied using computational fluid dynamics techniques. Both germanium and fluorine were found to diffuse at high temperature and low draw speed. A diffusion coefficent for germanium was determined and simulations showed that most diffusion occurred in the neck-down region. Draw temperature and preform feed rate had a comparable effect on diffusion. The hole size in PCFs was shown to depend on the draw temperature, preform feed rate and the preform internal pressure. Pressure was shown to be the most promising parameter for on-line control of the hole size. Heat transfer simulations showed that the air-structure had a significant effect on the temperature profile of the structure. It was also shown that the preform heating time was either increased or reduced compared to a solid structure and depended on the air-fraction...|$|R
