[...] She characterized it as, [...] "little more than piano and voice as if it is a cry from the soul". Gibson provided guest vocals for two tracks on the album.

500|$|Rider Haggard's writing {{style was}} the source of much {{criticism}} in reviews of She and his other works. His harshest critic was Augustus Moore, who wrote [...] "God help English literature when English people lay aside their Waverley novels, and the works of Defoe, Swift, Thackeray, Charlotte Brontë, George Eliot, and even Charles Reade for the penny dreadfuls of Mr Haggard"; adding, [...] "The man who could write 'he spoke to She' can have no ear at all". A more common sentiment was expressed by the review of She in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine: [...] "Mr. Rider Haggard is not an exquisite workman like Mr. [...] Stevenson, but <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal of power in his way, and rougher qualities which are more likely, perhaps, to 'take the town' than skill more delicate".|$|E
500|$|After {{determining}} that the Sixth Amendment's [...] "right to compulsory process is applicable {{in this state}} proceeding" [...] (i.e. that the Compulsory Process Clause applied to the states), the question became whether the specific instance of Washington's trial was an unconstitutional deprivation of that right. Despite the common law restriction against co-defendants testifying for each other, Warren noted that federal courts had refused to be [...] "bound by 'the dead hand of the common-law'" [...] since 1918. Along with the precedent of prior federal court decisions, {{the fact that there}} were a great deal of exceptions to this rule demonstrated the [...] "absurdity of the rule" [...] itself. Specifically, under the Texas statute—which allowed a defendant acquitted at a separate trial to testify for the other defendant at the other's trial—the [...] "law leaves [...] free to testify when <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> incentive to perjury, [...] bars his testimony in situations where he has a lesser motive to lie".|$|E

The members of the Kinks were featured as the band performing at the palais {{at the end of the}} video, with the spiv character solemnly watching the performance. Temple said of this scene, [...] "I was standing behind [...] Scorcese at a bar, and he was going on about that shot, saying it was one of his favorites ever. There's a [...] Buñuel film, Simon of the Desert, where this guy who's been suffering on his pillar in the desert in BC whatever ends up in some weird club in Mexico City in '65.

It debuted on March 16, 2004, on BET's Access Granted. Intended to resemble Brooklyn, New York, the video was shot in Los Angeles. It portrays Jackson traveling through the city at night to meet her boyfriend, interacting with the various people she encounters along the way. Jackson commented that the video was simple, {{and there was not}} a major production for wardrobe, hair and makeup. Explaining its concept, she stated [...] "I'm coming out of my apartment building and walking down the street, and you see all the goings-on in the neighborhood." [...] Jackson praised Meyers as a director, saying [...] "I think he's a wonderful director and he's a good friend, we've been friends since the [...] "All for You" [...] video. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> eye." [...] Hollywood casting agents sought a wide variety of extras, ranging from teenage delinquents to mothers picking up her babies and children from day care, and other people commuting by bus to and from work.

500|$|When it {{came time}} to record a lead single, Yankovic once again turned his {{attention}} to Michael Jackson. Jackson had just released his album Bad, a follow-up to 1983's immensely successful album Thriller. After Yankovic first heard the lead single, [...] "Bad", he immediately envisioned a parody entitled [...] "Fat". Initially, Yankovic didn't want to record another Michael Jackson parody. He later said, [...] "I was still primarily known as the 'Eat It' guy and I didn't want to become known as the guy who just rides Michael's coattails." [...] He later relented and sought out Jackson for permission. Jackson, a fan of Yankovic's work, had already let Yankovic parody his 1983 hit single [...] "Beat It". When presented with the new potential parody, Jackson not only approved it, but let Yankovic use his own Moonwalker subway set for the music video. Yankovic later presented Jackson with a gold record of Even Worse after the album sold over 500,000 copies. Jackson was so pleased with the song and video, he ordered twelve copies to give to his friends. [...] Yankovic later said, [...] "He doesn't have to let me do this kind of stuff. [...] The only reason he would let me is because <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> sense of humor." ...|$|E
500|$|On November 12, 2007, Anderson {{returned}} to the United States and was signed by the Manchester Millrats of the American Basketball Association (ABA). General manager Ian McCarthy said, [...] "Anthony gives us another super-talented point guard who can also break down the defense and really light up the scoreboard." [...] Anderson was unable {{to play in the}} team's first game due to a bruised collar bone. By January 1, 2008, Anderson was averaging 32.4 points per game. In mid-February, he was averaging 22.8 points, shooting 69% from the field and 48% on three-pointers. Among his most notable performances was when he scored 43 points to lead Manchester to a 133–123 win over the Boston Blizzard on January 26. He made all 10 of his two-point shots and was 17-of-23 from the field. ProBasketballNews.com ranked him the top ABA player and the third-best minor league basketball player in the country, above players such as Ian Mahinmi, Eddie Gill, and Elton Brown. On March 17, Anderson was named to the ABA All-Star Game. He scored 19 points {{in the first half of}} the game, propelling his East team to an 18-point lead at halftime. His game-high 33 points helped him win the Halogen Records ABA All-Star Most Valuable Player Award. Manchester owner Jason Briggs said, [...] "We are very proud of Anthony. He is a super-star in the making and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> work ethic and is very humble to boot." [...] On April 1, 2008, Anderson was named first-team All-ABA and won the league's Most Valuable Player Award. On March 19, 2010, he was named second-team ABA All-Decade, an award for the top players in the league from 2000 to 2009.|$|E

2500|$|Gandalf calls Tom Bombadil {{the eldest}} being in existence; this is {{evidenced}} by his Sindarin name Iarwain Ben-adar (Eldest and Fatherless). Dwarves called him Forn (Old Norse, meaning [...] "Ancient" [...] or [...] "Belonging to the distant past"; in Icelandic it can also mean that he has magical abilities), Men Orald (compare to Dutch oeroud and German uralt, [...] "ancient, very old"). All these names apparently mean [...] "Eldest". Treebeard calls himself the eldest living being of Middle-earth and says {{that he was there}} before anyone else. However, Tolkien remarked in another context: [...] "Treebeard is a character in my story, not me; and though <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> memory and some earthy wisdom, he {{is not one of the}} Wise, and there is quite a lot he does not know or understand." [...] The apparent discrepancy has also been explained by Tolkien deliberately mirroring the self-contradictory textual traditions of real-world medieval texts.|$|E
