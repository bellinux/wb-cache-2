5000|$|The {{regulation}} {{of genetic engineering}} varies widely by country. Countries such as the United States, Canada, Lebanon and Egypt use substantial equivalence {{as the starting point}} when assessing safety, while many countries such as those in the European Union, Brazil and China authorize GMO cultivation on a case-by-case basis. Many countries allow the import of GM food with authorization, but either do not allow its cultivation (Russia, Norway, Israel) or have provisions for cultivation, but no GM products are yet produced (Japan, South Korea). Most countries that do not allow for GMO cultivation do permit research. One of the key issues concerning regulators is whether GM products should be labeled. Labeling of GMO products in the marketplace is required in 64 countries. [...] Labeling can be mandatory up to a threshold GM content level (which varies between countries) or voluntary. A study investigating voluntary labeling in South Africa found that 31% of products labeled as <b>GMO-free</b> had a GM content above 1.0%.

5000|$|In May 2013 {{a strain}} of genetically-engineered glyphosate-resistant wheat was found {{on a farm in}} Oregon. Extensive testing {{confirmed}} the wheat as a variety - MON71800. The wheat had been developed by Monsanto but never been approved or marketed after the company had tested it between 1998 and 2005. The unexplained presence of this type of wheat presents a problem to wheat growers when buyers demand <b>GMO-free</b> wheat. Japan subsequently suspended import of soft white wheat from the United States.A Kansas farmer sued Monsanto over the release, saying it had caused the price of wheat grown in the US to fall.Monsanto suggested that the presence of this wheat was likely an act of sabotage. On Jun 14, 2013, the USDA announced: [...] "As of today, USDA has neither found nor been informed of anything that would indicate that this incident amounts to more than a single isolated incident in a single field on a single farm. All information collected so far shows no indication of the presence of GE wheat in commerce." [...] As of August 30, 2013, while the source of the GM wheat remained unknown, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan had all resumed placing orders, and the disruption of the export market was minimal.|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{consumer}} cost consequences of choosing <b>GMO-free</b> food over food that contains GMOs. Using text-mining algorithms applied to detailed product descriptions {{contained in a}} proprietary database of individual GMO and <b>GMO-free</b> foods at the retail level, we find that, when directly compared item by item, <b>GMO-free</b> food costs an average of 33 % more than a comparable food item that is not <b>GMO-free.</b> When compared on a per-ounce basis, <b>GMO-free</b> foods cost an average of 73 % more. Generalizing {{to the cost of}} a typical market basket of food consumed by American households, <b>GMO-free</b> food consumption would increase the average family food budget from $ 9, 462 to $ 12, 181 per year...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the end of}} the quasi-moratorium on genetically {{modified}} organisms (GMO) in the European Union in 2004, the establishment of <b>GMO-free</b> zones has become an EU wide phenomenon. In contrast to other European countries, Germany follows the concept of cooperative <b>GMO-free</b> zones where neighbouring farmers contractually refrain from GMO cultivation. In this article, we address the question which underlying factors could account for the establishment of cooperative <b>GMO-free</b> zones in Germany. Drawing on the existing literature on spatial agglomeration of different farming systems and the establishment of <b>GMO-free</b> zones, we provide the first systematic study on driving factors for the regional formation of <b>GMO-free</b> zones in Germany. The empirical analysis is based on a unique data set at the federal states level for the years 2004 to 2007. We show that infestation rates with the European Corn Borer, imminent Bt maize cultivation in the near vicinity and the number of arriving tourists mainly account for the establishment of cooperative <b>GMO-free</b> zones. This finding is consistent with the view that it is more the overall rejection of agro-biotechnology by broad strata of the population, including stakeholders in tourism and environmental protection, than economic benefits at the farm level which make German regions establish <b>GMO-free</b> zones.

30|$|The authors {{submit that}} the {{determination}} of areas where no GMOs shall be introduced can be one measure of this latter kind (concurring with this opinion, see [14]). For instance, the landscape plans could promulgate <b>GMO-free</b> regions, regions for organic production, regions recommended for GMO cultivation, etc.|$|E
30|$|Co-existence {{and freedom}} of choice between the {{different}} agricultures is not effectively achieved by the existing individual solutions to the conflict. Agricultural planning should therefore be introduced establishing, e.g. <b>GMO-free</b> zones. As outlined, neither landscape planning nor voluntary agreements result in binding law. More effective solutions {{can be found in}} binding agricultural planning. Such measures are compatible with constitutional guarantees as well as with EU law.|$|E
3000|$|It must further be analysed, whether binding {{agricultural}} planning defining regions where GMOs can be cultivated and where not would infringe EU law. According to Art. 22 Directive 2001 / 18 /EC [...] "Member States may not prohibit, restrict or impede the placing {{on the market}} of GMOs, as or in products, which comply with the requirements of this Directive." [...] This provision is breached if the designation of <b>GMO-free</b> regions must be considered as an impediment of the {{placing on the market}} of the genetically modified seed. The answer is in the negative because the designation would be concerned {{with the use of the}} GMO. The GMO could still be freely sold and purchased on the market. This could be different if the whole territory of a member state would be closed for GMO application. Then, the placing on the market would be impeded de facto because of low demand for the seed.c However, <b>GMO-free</b> regions are not supposed to cover the entire territory of a member state.|$|E
3000|$|... eWe {{note that}} the recent (July 2010) {{proposal}} of the European Commission that member states should have responsibility for decisions on cultivation of GMOs in their territories refers {{to the need to}} take into account regional and local factors, both agronomic and natural, when determining measures for coexistence or whether <b>GMO-free</b> areas should be created. Specific mention is made of, among other considerations, different 'climatic conditions (that influence the activity of pollinators and the transport of airborne pollen)'[62].|$|E
40|$|In many cell-culture {{and animal}} models, the {{therapeutic}} {{effects of the}} entrapped drugs in lipid nanocapsules (LNCs) were preserved with low toxicity. These results allow foreseeing further preclinical efficiency and toxicity studies in animals.

Then, several freezing protocols to store paclitaxel-loaded LNCs dispersions for a 6 -month period were compared. Results indicate that the Lipoïd® S 75 - 3 could not be certified <b>GMO-free.</b> The same soya bean lecithin certified to be <b>GMO-free</b> permitted to produce LNCs with expected characteristics. The blood administration of blank LNCs dispersions in rats induced no modifications of blood acidity, but a significant decrease of the base excess was observed. Injections of LNCs dispersions in animals might induce iatrogenic acidosis. We finally demonstrated that the best protocol to store LNCs dispersion for a 6 -month period is by freezing in liquid nitrogen. This protocol minimized the characteristics modifications and interrupted the drug-release phenomenon. These original data are expected to prepare of LNCs dispersions well adapted for i. v. administration in animals...|$|E
30|$|Concerning process certifications, the {{principal}} certifications available for food products were utilised: organic and <b>GMO-free.</b> These certifications {{are associated with}} production processes with different limitations {{in the use of}} the production factors. The phrasings adopted were the following: ‘This restaurant uses exclusively organic meats, fruit, and vegetables’ and ‘This restaurant uses exclusively foods without genetically modified organisms’.

No further information was provided about the meaning of the two certifications.|$|E

The lightweight tunnel production system can be widely used and modified for small-scale producers also in developing countries. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} in the title is divided into: (1) Can we trade {{the current generation of}} products from biotech or the technology itself? and (2) Can we trade the future generations of products of the technology? Controversy over the first generation of products has resulted in international trade being segmented into two markets: <b>GMO-free</b> and GMO. The first market is supported by voluntary labelling, making mandatory labelling largely unnecessary. While trade flows have been rearranged, markets have been little affected. We conclude that trade in the future generation will be dominated by capital and technology flows, with production for local markets dominating product trade flows.
