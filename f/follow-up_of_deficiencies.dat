40|$|Due to the {{shipping}} industry's international legal framework, there are loopholes in the system, which {{can increase the}} risk of incidents with high economic costs due to the substandard operation of vessels. This article uses duration analysis and through the creation of ship life cycles provides insight into the effectiveness of inspections on prolonging ship lives. The analysis accounts for fluctuations in the relevant economic environment and the (possibly time-varying) ship particulars. It is based on a unique dataset containing information on the timing of accidents, inspections and ship particular changes of more than 50, 000 vessels over a 29 -year time period (1978 – 2007). The results reveal that {{the shipping}} industry is a relatively safe industry but there is a possible over-inspection of vessels. The effect of inspections varies across ship types and the prevention of incidents with high economic costs can be improved by a coordinated approach of all types of inspections that are performed which allows the decrease of unnecessary inspections. Further, more emphasis should be placed on the rectification and <b>follow-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>deficiencies</b> and the implementation of the ISM code. Another added benefit for the industry would be to improve transparency related to class withdrawals and class transfers for all classification societies. Another interesting finding is that for the majority of ship types, an increase in earnings decreases the incident rate. This is in contrast to the industry perception of the impact of earnings. ...|$|E

The methods that were used for completing this study were a literature study about work environment and related legislation and a then a practical study. The practical study consisted of two parts, interviews with head of department and work environment representatives and a questionnaire among the employees. The results show a number <b>of</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in the systematic management of the work environment. In order to live up to the demands in the legislation the departments have to implement risk assessments at changes in the organization, implement annual <b>follow-ups</b> <b>of</b> the systematic management of the work environment, start to control completed measures and include psychological and social factors. To get a more effective systematic management of the work environment the departments have to prioritize the work environment higher and enhance the employees commitment and knowledge. The conclusions of this study is that the systematic management of the work environment at this four departments at Umeå university partly lives up to the demands in the legislation, but they have a number <b>of</b> <b>deficiencies</b> that must be corrected...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{classification}} of common symptoms {{and the laws of}} syndrome element combination in 251 cases of stable angina pectoris (SAP) by using cluster analysis and corresponding-correlation analysis. Methods: A total of 251 SAP cases were selected and their information from four diagnosis in traditional Chinese medicine was recorded. The classification of common symptom and the laws of syndrome element combination were investigated by cluster analysis and corresponding-correlation analysis. Results: Twenty-five symptoms found in 251 SAP cases were divided into four types by cluster analysis: <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> heart qi, <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> spleen qi, <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> qi and yin, and phlegm accumulation and blood stasis. The <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> heart qi had the closest relation to phlegm accumulation and blood stasis. By corresponding-correlation analysis, the <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> qi had the closest relation to blood stasis, next was turbid phlegm and heat stagnation, and then <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> qi and <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> yin. Conclusion: Blood stasis due to deficient qi is the key factor in pathogenesis <b>of</b> SAP. <b>Deficiency</b> <b>of</b> qi plus blood stasis, <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> qi plus <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> yin, blood stasis plus turbid phlegm, <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> heart qi plus blood stasis plus turbid phlegm are common syndrome element combinations of SAP.

40|$|International audienceComfort may be {{considered}} as the material aspect of well-being, and its limitation, defined as discomfort, exacerbates both the patient's and caregivers' difficulties. Discomfort results from the interaction of a patient's environment, treatment, and from the nature and severity of elementary deficits, such as spasticity, ranges of motion, pain, postural disorders, motor deficit and fatigue, bladder problems, insufficient ventilatory control, and also psychological difficulties. Although discomfort reduction may represent a major challenge in disabled persons, discomfort is usually underestimated in the assessment <b>of</b> <b>deficiencies,</b> disabilities, handicap, and even in quality of life (QOL) estimations. In this paper, we explain why discomfort may be a crucial problem in severe multiple sclerosis (MS) and argue for a systematic assessment of discomfort in the <b>follow-up</b> <b>of</b> the disease, especially in the following domains: dressing, washing, maintaining posture in a wheelchair and bed, food intake, mastication and swallowing, bowel control, urinary and feces emission, and also sexual life. The way to enhance comfort in MS patients is then analyzed...|$|R
