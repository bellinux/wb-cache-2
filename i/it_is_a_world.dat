500|$|The stories contain themes Hemingway was {{to revisit}} {{over the course}} of his career. He wrote about {{initiation}} rites, early love, marriage problems, disappointment in family life and the importance of male comradeship. The collection conjures a world of violence and war, suffering, executions; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> stripped of romance, where even [...] "the hero of the bullfight chapter pukes". Hemingway's early-20th century is a time [...] "out of season", where war, death, and tangled, unfulfilling relationships reign. Alienation in the modern world is particularly evident in [...] "Out of Season", which bears similarities to Eliot's The Waste Land. Eliot's Waste Land motif exists throughout much of Hemingway's early fiction, but is most notable in this collection, The Sun Also Rises (1926), and A Farewell to Arms (1929). He borrowed Eliot's device of using imagery to evoke feeling. Benson attributes similarities between Hemingway and Eliot to Pound, who edited both.|$|E
500|$|A fan of James Bond films, Marlohe {{said that}} she felt [...] "strongly {{connected}} to the Bond universe," [...] and described the franchise as allowing [...] "a lot of freedom in creation [...] because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> between reality and imagination". She added that she was more intrigued by the villains, particularly Grace Jones' performance as May Day in the 1985 film A View to a Kill. She also {{said that she}} enjoyed Famke Janssen's role as Xenia Onatopp in the 1995 film GoldenEye, citing her as her favorite Bond girl. When asked about her preference for antagonists, Marlohe responded that she enjoyed parts that have [...] "elements of whimsy and madness to them". While preparing for the role, Marlohe also paid {{close attention to the}} soundtracks of the earlier films, saying that she focused on [...] "respecting the spirit of the James Bond movies".|$|E

50|$|Abdication debuted to much anticipation. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> premiere by <b>a</b> non-Irish playwright, at {{the time}} {{something}} of a novelty in Ireland, and the play was perceived to portray the unprecedented abdication in 1936 of England's King Edward VIII, this still quite fresh in people's minds.|$|R

2500|$|.....if Liverpool can {{get into}} top gear again there is no limit to the city's potential. The scale and {{resilience}} of the buildings and people is amazing – <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> city, far more so than London and Manchester. It doesn't feel like anywhere else in Lancashire: comparisons always end up overseas – Dublin, or Boston, or Hamburg. The city is tremendous, and so, {{right up to the}} First World War, were the abilities of the architects who built over it…… The centre is humane and convenient to walk around in, but never loses its scale. And, in spite of the bombings and the carelessness, it is still full of superb buildings. Fifty years ago it must have outdone anything in England." [...] – Ian Nairn, Britain's Changing Towns, 1967 ...|$|E
2500|$|Adam Serwer of The Atlantic {{regarded}} A Song of Ice and Fire as [...] "more a {{story of}} politics than one of heroism, a story about humanity wrestling with its baser obsessions than fulfilling its glorious potential" [...] where the emergent power struggle stems from the feudal system's repression and not from the fight {{between good and evil}} (see section Moral ambiguity). Damien G. Walter saw Martin's strength in [...] "his compendious understanding of the human stories driving the grand political narrative. There {{does not seem to be}} a single living soul in the land of Westeros that Martin does not have insight into, from the highest king to the lowest petty thief. [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> of high stakes, where the winners prosper and the losers are mercilessly ground under heel. Against this tapestry every one of Martin's characters is forced to choose between their love for those close to them and the greater interests of honour, duty and the realm. More often than not, those who make the noble choice pay with their lives." ...|$|E

Nothing of the sort, for not a soul appeared but a sanginary-looking boy asleep under the current bushes.|$|E
