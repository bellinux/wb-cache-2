Advantages of the cylindrical weir shape include the stable overflow pattern, the ease to pass floating debris, {{the simplicity of}} design compared to ogee crest design and the associated lower costs. In present study, it was investigated the overflow characteristics of circular weirs in laboratory for various cylinder radii of three sizes (11. 4, 9. 0, 6. 3 cm), and the models fixed on the channel bed vertically to the direction of flow.

40|$|Introduction: The {{compound}} sharp-crested weirs {{are composed}} from several notches {{and those are}} designedin different shapes. One of the hydraulic advantagesof compound weirs is that atlowflow rate, the bottomnotchacts assimpleweir andwith the creation of morehydraulicheadonits upstream, due to theshape of thenotch, make dischargemeasurement withappropriatesensitivity. In high flow rates, the upper notch prevents of increasing upstream water level and backwater and discharge measurement is possible with acceptable accuracy. The compound sharp-crested weirs {{can be used as}} an appropriate solution for discharge measurement with reasonable accuracy and sensitivity of the extensive range of flows. Relations are derived from this kind of weirs hassufficientaccuracy withobservation of design criteriaandconstructionstandards. The purposeofthisresearch was a laboratory investigation of geometricandhydraulic effective parameterson discharge coefficient of compound arched circular- rectangular sharp-crested weirs in two cases of full width of channel and partially contracted weirs and compare the values of the discharge coefficient of compound and simple rectangular weirs. Materials and Methods:Considering the geometric, kinematic and dynamic variables affecting the free flow of sharp-crested weirs, there are 11 independent variableswiththree main quantities (length, massandtime). Usingdimensional analysis with π-Buckinghammethod,it can bederived thedimansionlessrelationship. In order to assess theeffect of various parametersonthe coefficient ofCd,thedimansionlessdiagramsare used. Inthe state of(h≤h 0), discharge relationship usedinsimplecircular weir. In thestate of(h>h 0), discharge of compound weir is computeted from the linear combination of discharge relationships in circular and rectangular weirs. Experimentsare conducted inthe hydraulic engineering models laboratory, Department of Water Engineering, University of Tabriz, in a rectangular glass-metal flume of 9 m length, 25 cm width and 50 cm height. Aftersetting up the weirs in a relevant place of flume andestablish thesteady flow,experiments were performedinthefree flowon 36 models of weirs. Results and Discussion:In this research, theeffects ofrectangularnotch width, the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>weir</b> crest, the height ofcirculararch notch were investigated forchanges of headwithdimensionless ratios of h/P,h/R,h/h_ 0,h/Bon discharge coefficient. The results showthat fora known headover the weir, discharge coefficient increase about 2 to 10 percent with the development of the rectangular notch width of compound and simple rectangular sharp-crested weirs. For a given head over the weir, discharge coefficient decrease approximately 1 to 5 percent by increasing the height of the weir crest of compound and simple sharp-crested weirs. Fora given head over weir in low head values, discharge coefficient increase approximately 35 percent by reducing the height of circulararch notch in the compound weirs than simple rectangular weirs. Based on statistical indicators, computational and observation discharge coefficient values in most compound and simple weirs, acceptable coincidence with each other. The meanvalues of thecoefficient of determination (R 2) androot mean square error(RMSE) are 0. 630 and 0. 061,respectively. Among the effective factors that indicate the difference, it can be referred to the theoretical equation in the compound state that is obtained by assuming a linear combination of simple weirs. The effect of the lateral walls of the flume, the measurement accuracy of hydraulic head and discharge, the conditions of flow entrance, the extension of the range of empirical equations proposed in literature for discharge coefficient of simple weirs, Other factors contributing to the difference between the estimated and observed values of discharge coefficient. Inthistypeofweirs,the least amount ofdiscontinuityin thetransition region of simple to compound state in head-discharge relationship can be seenin thewide rangeofdischargescomparedwithother kinds ofcompound weirswithhorizontalorslopingcrests. Conclusion:In this research, a seri of experiments conducted to investigate Cd of the compound arched circular-rectangular sharp-crested weirs in both full width of the channel and partially contracted. The advantage of these weirsisdischarge measurement ina wide range. According to the parametersaffecting theweir, Cd has changed from 0. 54 to 0. 89 range in the compound weirs and 0. 55 to 0. 66 range in the simple rectangular weirs. Bychanging the weir specifications, Cd increase about 35 percentthan thesimplerectangular weir. Forchanges of the head by usingthe experimental data, the discharge continuityofthistypeofweir is far more thanthecompound weirs withhorizontal orinclined crests.

40|$|The {{problems}} caused by suspended sediment overloading in open channels are of great importance to the hydraulic engineers. One of the important {{problems caused}} by the sediment overloading during flood seasons is the change in bed level and corresponding water level of rivers due to its deposition on the river bed. At the upstream reaches, the bed slope is high, velocity is high and hence the rivers carry large amount of sediment during flood seasons. In this paper, eighty-one experiments on a laboratory open-channel of cross-section dimensions (20 * 50) cm and (10) m long. The experiments include using sharp crested weir in the last third part of the channel. Three <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>weir</b> are used; namely half width of channel (B), equal to the width, and 1. 5 times the width of channel). Also, three bed slopes of the channel are used; namely 0. 015, 0. 0225, and 0. 03). In all experiments, the values of discharge are limited between 100 and 300 l/min. The concentration of suspended sediment is measured upstream and downstream the weir through each experiment to calculate the sediment reduction ratio (SRR%). The results of the laboratory experiments showed that the sediment reduction ratio increases with the increase <b>of</b> <b>weir</b> <b>height</b> and reaches about (63 %) at a channel bed slope of (0. 015) and a weir height 1. 5 B.

All the experiments were performed in a horizontal rectangular flume, 7 m long, 0. 32 m wide and 0. 35 m high.

The companies were reconstituted by the receiver, and continued to trade. From 1917, they were managed jointly, and on 1 January 1929, were sold to the Regent's Canal, and with the Grand Junction Canal, {{became part of the}} Grand Union Canal. In order to effectively compete, the new company wanted to upgrade the canals so that wide barges could be used between London and Birmingham. Their aim was to accommodate barges 12.5 ft wide immediately, and ultimately to make the route suitable for 14 ft barges. 52 locks on the two Warwick canals were converted into weirs, and 51 new locks, each 83.5 by 15 ft were built. There was one less because the flight of six at Knowle was replaced by five. In order to give a depth of 5.5 ft, the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>weirs</b> were raised or lock sills were lowered.

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{handling}} of debris in small hydro power intakes is assessed by evaluating the concept of back flushing with a horizontally fixed trash rack. The concept of back flushing is to reverse the flow over the trash rack {{for a short period}} of time in order to detach and evacuate clogged debris through a flushing pipe or gate. In this study the concept of back flushing with a horizontal trash rack is evaluated for two different designs; a one chamber design and a two chamber design. The one chamber design is based on H. Brekke?s conceptual idea. The two chamber design is also based on H. Brekke?s idea but it is also inspired by Bergedammen. Bergedammen is an intake designed with two chambers making it possible to continue power production while back flushing one chamber at the time. The efficiency of back flushing as well as the hydraulic performance during normal operation is mainly evaluated using numerical modelling and a CFD-software. The concept of back flushing, general intake hydraulics and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is covered by the literature study in this thesis. The evaluation of the back flushing concept is initiated by a physical demonstration model with two chambers. The demonstration model is built and tested for flushing efficiency and performance during normal operation. The following numerical tests are performed on 4 different model designs. The first model illustrates a full scale one chamber design. The second model illustrates a full scale two chamber design. The third model is identical to the demonstration model. The forth model is designed as a result of the demonstration model and the previous numerical models, where important model parameters were identified. The important model parameters for effective flushing and hydraulic performance during normal operation is identified as the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>weir,</b> the vertical position of the trash rack, the length of the model and the amount of water available for flushing. The numerical analyses evaluate the flushing efficiency by assessing the velocity distribution over the trash rack. The hydraulic performance of the models during normal operation is evaluated by assessing streamlines, head loss and turbulent kinetic energy levels (TKE) by the outlet. During flushing the most important parameter is the height between the top <b>of</b> the <b>weir</b> and the trash rack. A high weir results in an even velocity distribution over the trash rack. A low weir results in uneven velocities with higher velocities along the weir. During normal production the length of the model and the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>weir</b> are important parameters affecting both the total head loss and TKE-values. The results achieved by the numerical modelling should be validated, as further research, on a scale model designed and built in the lab.
