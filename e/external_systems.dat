25|$|In the {{experimental}} setting, {{researchers have also}} tested compensatory control in regard to individuals’ perceptions of <b>external</b> <b>systems,</b> such as religion or government. For example, Kay and colleagues found that in a laboratory setting, individuals {{are more likely to}} endorse broad <b>external</b> <b>systems</b> (e.g., religion or sociopolitical systems) that impose order and control on their lives when they are induced with lowered levels of personal control. In this study, researchers suggest that when a person’s personal control is lessened, their motivation to believe in order is threatened, resulting in compensation of this threat through adherence to other external sources of control.|$|E

In a bleedless aircraft such as the Boeing 787, each engine has two variable-frequency electrical generators to compensate for not providing compressed air to <b>external</b> <b>systems.</b> Eliminating bleed air and replacing it with extra electric generation is believed to provide a net improvement in engine efficiency, lower weight, and ease of maintenance.|$|E
25|$|A {{key factor}} in a party's {{decision}} to participate in or engage with a corporation is their confidence that the corporation will deliver the party's expected outcomes. When categories of parties (stakeholders) do not have sufficient confidence that a corporation is being controlled and directed {{in a manner consistent}} with their desired outcomes, they are less likely to engage with the corporation. When this becomes an endemic system feature, the loss of confidence and participation in markets may affect many other stakeholders, and increases the likelihood of political action. There is substantial interest in how <b>external</b> <b>systems</b> and institutions, including markets, influence corporate governance.|$|E
25|$|It {{is common}} for two or more {{separate}} open clusters to form {{out of the same}} molecular cloud. In the Large Magellanic Cloud, both Hodge 301 and R136 are forming from the gases of the Tarantula Nebula, while in our own galaxy, tracing back the motion through space of the Hyades and Praesepe, two prominent nearby open clusters, suggests that they formed in the same cloud about 600 million years ago. Sometimes, two clusters born at the same time will form a binary cluster. The best known example in the Milky Way is the Double Cluster of NGC 869 and NGC 884 (sometimes mistakenly called h and χ Persei; h refers to a neighboring star and χ to both clusters), but at least 10 more double clusters are known to exist. Many more are known in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds—they are easier to detect in <b>external</b> <b>systems</b> than in our own galaxy because projection effects can cause unrelated clusters within the Milky Way to appear close to each other.|$|E
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{behaviour}} of an ensemble of chaotic oscillators coupled only to an <b>external</b> chaotic <b>system,</b> whose intrinsic dynamics may be similar or dissimilar to the group. Counter-intuitively, {{we find that}} a dissimilar <b>external</b> <b>system</b> manages to suppress the intrinsic chaos of the oscillators to fixed point dynamics, at sufficiently high coupling strengths. So, while synchronization is induced readily by coupling to an identical <b>external</b> <b>system,</b> control to fixed states is achieved only if the <b>external</b> <b>system</b> is dissimilar. We quantify the efficacy of control by estimating the fraction of random initial states that go to fixed points, a measure analogous to basin stability. Lastly, we indicate the generality of this phenomenon by demonstrating suppression of chaotic oscillations by coupling to a common hyper-chaotic system. These results then indicate the easy controllability of chaotic oscillators by an <b>external</b> chaotic <b>system,</b> thereby suggesting a potent method that may help design control strategies...|$|R

[...] The APG-77v1 with newer GaAs modules provides a range of [...] or more; this {{is believed to be}} possible due to the use of more narrow beams. Radar information is processed by two Raytheon Common Integrated Processor (CIP)s, each capable of processing up to 10.5billion instructions per second. In a process known as sensor fusion, data from the radar, other sensors, and <b>external</b> <b>systems</b> is filtered and combined by the CIP into a common view, reducing pilot workload. However, upgrading the aircraft's avionics was reportedly very challenging due to their highly integrated nature.|$|E
