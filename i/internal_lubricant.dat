These {{additives}} may work by lubricating the tool-chip interface, decreasing the shear strength of the material, or increasing the brittleness of the chip. Historically, sulphur and lead have been the most common additives, but bismuth and tin are increasingly popular for environmental reasons. Lead can improve the machinability of steel because it acts as an <b>internal</b> <b>lubricant</b> in the cutting zone. Since lead has poor shear strength, it allows the chip to slide more freely past the cutting edge. When it is added in small quantities to steel, it can greatly improve its machinability while not significantly affecting the steel's strength. Sulphur improves the machinability of steel by forming low shear strength inclusions in the cutting zone. These inclusions are stress risers that weaken the steel, allowing it to deform more easily.|$|E

Test results are obtained during small and large-scale laboratory testing under high-load and high-temperature conditions and are further related to the effect of contact conditions. The study reveals that some lubricants are not effective under the entire range of sliding temperatures and/or normal loads.

40|$|Abstract The {{potential}} for using graphite particles as an <b>internal</b> <b>lubricant</b> during machining is considered. Graphite particles {{were found to}} form during graphitisation of experimental medium-carbon steel alloyed with Si and Al. The graphite nucleation sites were strongly influenced by the starting microstructure, whether ferrite-pearlite, bainite or martensite, as revealed by light and electron microscopy. Favourable nucleation sites in the ferrite-pearlite starting microstructure were, not unexpectedly, found to be located within pearlite colonies, no doubt due {{to the presence of}} abundant cementite as a source of carbon. In consequence, the final distribution of graphite nodules in ferrite-pearlite microstructures was less uniform than for the bainite microstructure studied. In the case of martensite, this study found a predominance of nucleation at grain boundaries, again leading to less uniform graphite dispersions...|$|E

However, more than 0. 6 wt% of lubricant aids the densification in the low-pressure region but limits the maximum density at high pressure. Moreover, 0. 3 - 0. 6 wt% of lubricant offers a more uniform density distribution to the powder compact, while greater than 0. 6 wt% of lubricant leads to a segregation of lubricant in the surface region.

The design of a dynamic loading mechanism and control of the sliding motion are detailed. The importance of dynamic testing is illustrated for polyamides and polyacetals under pure, internally lubricated and glass fibre-reinforced conditions.

Zinc stearate acts as an <b>internal</b> <b>lubricant,</b> i. e., it decreases the friction forces between the particles and favors an increase in the degree of texture of the powders, which is induced by the magnetic field. It is shown that the density and the magnetic hysteresis characteristics of sintered magnets produced using additions of 0. 15 wt % zinc stearate exceeds the corresponding values obtained for magnets produced without this addition at a filling density of powders in containers of more than 2. 9 and 3. 0 g/cm 3 in dry and wet states, respectively.

40|$|This {{investigation}} has {{been concerned with}} the behaviour of solid <b>internal</b> <b>lubricant</b> during mixing, compaction, ejection, dewaxing and sintering of iron powder compacts. Zinc stearate (0. 01 %- 4. 0 %) was added to irregular iron powder by admixing or precipitation from solution. Pressure/density relationships, determined by continuous compaction, and loose packed densities were used to show that small additions of zinc stearate reduced interparticle friction during loose packing and at low compaction pressures. Large additions decreased particle/die-wall friction during compaction and ejection but also caused compaction inhibition. Transverse rupture strengths were determined on compacts containing various stearate based lubricants and {{it was found that}} green strength was reduced by the interposition of a thin lubricant layer within inter~particle contacts. Only materials much finer than the iron powder respectively) were able to form such layers. Investigations were undertaken to determine the effect of the decomposition of these lubricants on the development of mechanical properties in dewaxed or sintered compacts. Physical and chemical influences on tensile strength were observed. Decomposition of lubricants was associated with reductions of strength caused by the physical effects of pressure increases and removal of lubricant from interparticle contacts. There were also chemical effects associated with the influence of gaseous decomposition products and solid residues on sintering mechanisms. Thermogravimetry was used to study the decomposition behaviour of various lubricants as free compounds and within compacts. The influence of process variables such as atmosphere type, flow-rate and compact density were investigated. In a reducing atmosphere the decomposition of these lubricants was characterised by two stages. The first involved the rapid decomposition of the hydrocarbon radical. The second, higher temperature, reactions depended on lubricant type and involved solid residues. The removal of lubricant could also markedly affect dimensional change...|$|E
40|$|A {{small amount}} of <b>internal</b> <b>lubricant</b> (Stearic acid (SA) or Magnesium {{stearate}} (MgSt)) was added to Ti powder {{for the purpose of}} improving the compressibility and the green density homogeneity. Lubrication improved the compressibility of Ti powder compacts, especially in the low pressure region (< 400 MPa), yet at higher pressures, lubricants hindered further improvement. An addition of up to 0. 3 wt. % SA improved the green density. MgSt showed a better lubrication effect and an addition of up to 0. 6 wt. % improved the density. The difference in the lubrication effect between SA and MgSt was due to their mixing or blending characteristics. A homogenous mixing of lubricant led to an increased lubricated area and the effectiveness of the lubrication. Lubricants had a strong influence on shape retention, green strength and ejection behaviour of Ti powder compacts. The green density distribution was improved by adding a lubricant. The density profiles were measured experimentally using a coloured layer method. SA gave better results compared with MgSt, with 0. 6 wt. % of SA considered to be the optimum addition. The mixing or blending characteristics of SA additions accounted for the better improvement in performance. By adding a lubricant, the sintered density distribution in Ti compacts was improved by controlling the pore morphology with respect to their size, aspect ratio and orientation. But 1 wt. % SA created many pores ranging in size from 50 - 100 μm, both in the top and bottom regions, and this led to very bad ductility. The consistency in mechanical properties of a sintered Ti Φ 40 mm compact was significantly improved by adding 0. 6 wt. % SA. Such improvement was achieved because of a lower sintering mismatch initiated from a more homogenously distributed green density, both in the horizontal and transverse directions. MgSt was not recommended because of higher oxygen pick-up. Rare earth elements (RE) were added to Ti metal and alloy for the purpose of scavenging oxygen and to promote better microstructural control. Three additive forms were studied. Er and LaB 6 additions were added to Ti and Ti 6 Al 4 V alloys directly. The Ti(Ti 6 Al 4 V) -Y alloy was made by mechanical milling (MM). But direct Er additions caused a segregated microstructure and processing involving the MM of Ti(Ti 6 Al 4 V) -Y leaded to oxygen pick-up. These methods are therefore not recommended. Direct LaB 6 additions achieved excellent results. The reinforcement was uniformly distributed with various orientations and the microstructure was refined. The TiB reinforcement gave excellent strength and good ductility. The acicular TiB phase seemed to be the only problem, because while it significantly improved the strength it decreased the ductility. Theoretical research was carried out on the compaction process for internally lubricated Ti powder. A modified Cooper-Eaton formula was employed to analyse the compaction behaviour of Ti powder. There was a good fit between the simulation results and the experimental data. The theoretical research indicated that cold compaction of titanium powder could be separated into two stages: a particle rearrangement (PR) stage, which occurred in a compacting pressure range of 0 - 200 MPa, followed by a plastic deformation (PD) initiated (PR) stage from 200 - 1000 MPa. The existence of stage II was due to the low plastic deformability of titanium and the low density achieved at the end of stage I. Ti particles needed to be plastically deformed or even cracked into fragments to fill the gaps in-between Ti particles. At pressures between 200 - 600 MPa, the use of an <b>internal</b> <b>lubricant</b> improved consolidation, leading to better densification because a lubricant facilitates particle motion. On the basis of this discussion, the approaches for modifying the cold compaction behaviour of Ti powder were studied...|$|E
40|$|Polymers {{are used}} in dry sliding {{applications}} due to self-lubricating ability. Most work from literature focuses on mechanical effects causing transfer and results from small-scale testing. Friction and wear of polymers are influenced by visco-elastic deformation and sliding temperature and depend on the test configuration. In present work, tribophysical or tribochemical effects on worn surfaces and debris are investigated on micro-scale explaining transitions in tribological performance. Extrapolations of friction and wear data from small-scale testing towards large-scale testing are discussed in relation to polymer structures and wear debris mobility depending. Sliding applications at either high-temperature (100 to 260 °C) or high-load (8 to 150 MPa) conditions are covered in this work, using high-performance polymers such as sintered or thermoplastic polyimide, or engineering polymers such as polyamide, polyoxymethylene, polyethylene terephthalate and polyethylene. The effect of <b>internal</b> <b>lubricants</b> such as graphite, PTFE and silicon oil is investigated. Experimental techniques are presented in a {{first part of this}} work. Small-scale sliding tests are done on a cylinder-on-plate configuration and large-scale sliding is done on flat-on-flat configurations. An analytical model to calculate the maximum polymer surface temperature T* during sliding is introduced and verified. A change from integrated flash temperature concept to bulk temperature concept should be considered at high loads, agreeing to a transition in visco-elastic polymer deformation. Raman spectroscopy and thermo-analytical polymer analysis are used to characterise wear products. The importance of wear debris interactions forming transfer is demonstrated like this. Micro-scale to small-scale relations in friction and wear for polyimides are investigated {{in the second part of}} this work. The relation between tribological behaviour and brittleness, hydrolysis and imidisation is investigated on molecular scale. Small-scale to large-scale testing correlations for engineering polymers are discussed in the third part of this work. Four experimental models comparing small-scale and large-scale tribological data are evaluated with a single or two mechanical parameters.

A surface parameter accounts for the wall-fluid interaction and commensurability, and is valid for both canonical and complex crystal lattices: this quantity is then linked to the shear stress transferred to the fluid molecules. The <b>lubricant</b> <b>internal</b> cohesion under confinement is described by a bulk viscosity term.

40|$|Short carbon fibre-reinforced {{thermoplastic}} polyimides (30 wt%) often show {{high and}} unstable coefficients of friction. In this study, {{the effects of}} internal lubrication by polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) (15 wt%) or silicon oil (15 wt%) have been investigated using a reciprocating cylinder-on-plate test under 50 - 100 N normal loads and 0. 3 - 1. 2 m/s sliding velocities. The sliding mechanisms are discussed by considering mechanical and thermochemical modifications. The PTFE additives provide lowest coefficients of friction completely stabilising after a transition from mechanically into thermally controlled sliding at 120 A degrees C. The sliding mechanisms and homogeneous transfer films are mainly controlled by plasticisation rather than easy-shear of its lamellar structure that is hindered by fibre reinforcement. Thermoplastic lubricants decrease the mechanical strength and therefore cause deformation and highest wear rates under 200 N. <b>Internal</b> oil <b>lubricants</b> do not reduce coefficients of friction at mild to intermediate normal loads and sliding velocities, while they become most efficient at severe sliding conditions, augmenting the pv-limit. While coefficients of friction match uniquely to the pv-conditions, the wear rates are mainly influenced by the load level: the lowest wear rates are provided by PTFE at low to intermediate pv-conditions and by oil lubricants under high normal loads...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} tableting compression {{by using}} {{internal and external}} lubricant addition. The effect of lubricant addition on the enzymatic activity of trypsin, which {{was used as a}} model drug during the tableting compression process, was also investigated. The powder mixture (2 % crystalline trypsin, 58 % crystalline lactose, and 40 % microcrystalline cellulose) was kneaded with 5 % hydroxypropyl cellulose aqueous solution and then granulated using an extruding granulator equipped with a 0. 5 -mm mesh screen at 20 rpm. After drying, the sample granules were passed through a 10 -mesh screen (1680 μm). A 200 -mg sample was compressed by using 8 -mm punches and dies at 49, 98, 196, or 388 MPa (Mega Pascal) at a speed of 25 mm/min. The external lubricant compression was performed using granules without lubricant in the punches and dies. The granules were already dry coated by the lubricant. In contrast, the <b>internal</b> <b>lubricant</b> compression was performed using sample granules (without dry coating) containing 0. 5 % lubricant. At 98 MPa, for example, the compression level using the external lubricant addition method was about 13 % higher than that for internal addition. The significantly higher compressing energy was also observed at other MPas. By comparison, the friction energy for the external addition method calculated based on upper and lower compression forces was only slightly larger. The hardness of tablets prepared using the internal addition method was 34 % to 48 % lower than that for the external addition method. The total pore volume of the tablet prepared using the external addition method was significantly higher. The maximum ejection pressure using the no-addition method (ie, the tablet was prepared using neither dry-coated granules nor added lubricant) was significantly higher than that of other addition methods. The order was as follows: no addition, external addition, and then internal addition. The ejection energy (EE) for internal addition was the lowest; for no addition, EE was the highest. In the dissolution test, the tablets obtained using external addition immediately disintegrated and showed faster drug release than those prepared using internal addition. This result occurred because the water penetration rate of the tablet using the external addition was much higher. The trypsin activity in tablets prepared using the external addition method was significantly higher than that produced using the internal addition method at the same pressure. All these results suggest that the external addition method might produce a fast-dissolution tablet. Because the drug will be compressed using low pressure only, an unstable bulk drug may be tableted without losing potency...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{molecular}} lubrication problems, lubricants are {{confined to}} molecular scale thicknesses. Experiments have shown that in such confinements the structure and dynamics of lubricants are greatly influenced {{by the nature of}} the confining surfaces. The well-organized surface structure is reflected, through the interfacial interactions, by a set of potential valleys that lubricant molecules are attracted to occupy. Any surface, no matter how geometrically smooth, manifests a sort of a foot-print over the neighboring lubricant layers. The surface interaction is a combination of two components: adsorption and corrugation potentials. In a Lennard-Jones model for the surface interactions, the adsorption potential increases with the surface density and with the well-depth energy of the surface-lubricant interaction. The corrugation potential, on the other hand, depends on the in-plane potential variations which are due to the crystalline structure and density of the surfaces. A simple method is proposed which is inspired by this need for quantitative measurements of adsorption and corrugation potentials. The method is initially used to compare the properties of different surface types. These surfaces are then used to confine a lubricant film in molecular lubrication conditions. The results for lubricant structuring, boundary flow and friction are analyzed according to the measured adsorption and corrugation. The major effects of lubricant molecular nature and shape in confined films between wetting and non-wetting surfaces are then studied. In terms of global friction it was found that corrugation is the most influencing factor through its strong relationship with boundary slip and thus surface wettability. In comparison between geometrically smooth surface models, low-friction surfaces can be identified as those with the lowest potential corrugation. In pure confined lubricants, the increase of chain length and branching results in an attenuation of the layering phenomena. The structure of the film becomes bulk-like homogeneous in branched molecules at only three molecular diameters distance from the confining surfaces. Long and branched chains encounter an increased level of inter-layer bridging which results in a stronger <b>internal</b> <b>lubricant</b> cohesion. When no boundary slip occurs as in the case of wetting surfaces, molecular length and branching increase friction because of the enhanced effective viscosity of the film. However near non-wetting surfaces, the internal film cohesion in long and branched chains may become stronger than their cohesion with the surfaces. This results in a larger boundary slip and an attenuation of friction in these films. Finally, hexadecane and ZDDP polar anti-wear additive were simulated. In agreement with experiments, the presence of ZDDP resulted in a higher friction compared to pure hexadecane oil. It was found that the molecular migration and adsorption of ZDDP molecules at the surfaces are the cause of this phenomenon. When ZDDP stick to the non-wetting surfaces, they significantly reduce the boundary slip which normally occurs with pure hexadecane oil. Moreover in the case of wetting surfaces, the whole adsorbed layer becomes locked to the surfaces. This results in a global increase of the average shear rate in the middle of the film. The central hexadecane film becomes sheared at a higher rate giving rise to a higher shear stress and friction, in agreement with experimental findings...|$|E

30|$|Lubricant is a {{substance}} (often a liquid) reduces the friction and wear when introduced between two moving surfaces. A lubricant provides a protective film {{which allows for}} two touching surfaces to be separated and thus lessening the friction between them. Hence, in <b>internal</b> combustion engines <b>lubricant</b> is very essential for longer life of the engine. Lubricants are generally composed {{of a majority of}} base oil plus a variety of additives to impart desirable characteristics. The types of the lubricant depend upon the types of base oils. The base oils may be mineral (petroleum originated), synthetic (polyalphaolefins, polyalkylene glycols, synthetic esters, silicones etc.) or vegetable (sunflower oil, soybean oil, palm oil etc.). When the base oil is a vegetable oil, then the lubricant is known as biolubricant, in case of synthetic oil it is called synthetic lubricant and when the base oil is mineral or petroleum based then the lubricant is known as mineral lubricant. Most of the lubricants used today are mineral or petroleum based and are a mixture of paraffinic, naphthenic and aromatic hydrocarbons. Nowadays, with increasing environmental pollution although it is essential to use vegetable oils as base fluid rather than mineral oil or synthetic ester based oils, but due to the poor oxidative and hydrolytic stability, high temperature sensitivity of tribological behavior, poor cold flow properties and high cost vegetable oils are very limitedly used as base oils for industrial lubricants [1, 2]. So, the petroleum-based fluids are still now dominated in the lubricant market due to its ease availability and lower cost.|$|R
