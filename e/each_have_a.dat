5|$|Krake {{operates}} {{with three}} floorless steel and fiberglass trains. Each train has three cars that can seat six riders {{in a single}} row {{for a total of}} 18 riders per train. The seats are black and <b>each</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> brown over-the-shoulder restraint. On each train, there are a pair of tubes that allow the water to be shot into the air as the train reaches the bottom of the first drop. Also, the trains for the roller coaster were manufactured in Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|Paper Mario {{combines}} traditional role-playing game (RPG) elements with {{concepts and}} features from the Mario series. For {{the majority of}} the game, the player controls Mario, who can jump and use his hammer to overcome physical obstacles placed in the game's overworld. Many of the game's puzzles and boundaries are based upon the abilities of Mario's partners, who <b>each</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> specialised skill required for progression in the game. The player accumulates partners as they advance into different locations; only one partner can accompany Mario in the overworld, although the player can interchange them at any time.|$|E
5|$|Readville has {{an unusual}} layout {{because it is}} built on the {{crossing}} of two rail lines. The Fairmount Line and Franklin Line <b>each</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> single track atop an embankment. The Fairmount Line has a single side platform, while the Franklin Line has two. The Fairmount Line track continues atop a bridge over the Northeast Corridor to join with the Franklin Line. This connection is used by several trains each rush hour, allowing trains from the Franklin Line to avoid congestion in the crowded Southwest Corridor.|$|E

She volunteers to defend Tadaga from enemy armies and meets Keid, who becomes enlisted in the rebel force as an officer. The third playable character, Havilan, is a veteran piloting a flying gunboat.|$|E
5|$|The three serotypes of poliovirus, PV1, PV2, and PV3, <b>each</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{slightly}} different capsid protein. Capsid proteins define cellular receptor specificity and virus antigenicity. PV1 {{is the most}} common form encountered in nature, but all three forms are extremely infectious. As of November 2015, wild PV1 is highly localized to regions in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Wild PV2 was declared eradicated in September 2015 after last being detected in October 1999 in Uttar Pradesh, India. As of November 2015, wild PV3 has not been seen since its 2012 detection in parts of Nigeria and Pakistan.|$|E

5|$|An {{association}} with the folliculin (FLCN) gene was first reported in 2002. This 14-exon gene {{is located on the}} short arm of chromosome 17 (17p11.2) and has a cytosine-rich region in exon 11 particularly susceptible to mutation. The most common mutation in this region is the insertion or deletion of a cytosine residue, found in 53% of Birt–Hogg–Dubé families. There is {{no significant difference in the}} symptoms experienced by families with an insertion at that location compared to those who have a deletion. However, mutations in FLCN associated with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome are heterogeneous, and are often nonsense mutations or frameshift mutations that cause early truncation of the protein product at the carboxy-terminus. Very rarely, missense mutations are observed. Mutations are often passed from one generation to the next in an autosomal dominant fashion but can occur as a new mutation in an individual with no prior family history (a de novo mutation). The children of an affected parent <b>each</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> 50% chance of having the disease. Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome has very high penetrance. A correlation between different FLCN genotypes and phenotypes has not been discovered.|$|E
5|$|Civil parishes do {{not cover}} {{the whole of}} England and mostly exist in rural areas. They are usually {{administered}} by parish councils which have various local responsibilities. Parish councillors, like city councillors, are elected to represent the views of local people. Ailsworth, Bainton, Barnack, Borough Fen, Bretton, Castor, Deeping Gate, Etton, Eye, Glinton, Helpston, Marholm, Maxey, Newborough, Northborough, Orton Longueville, Orton Waterville, Peakirk, St. Martin's Without (Parish Meeting), Southorpe, Sutton, Thorney, Thornhaugh, Ufford, Upton (Parish Meeting), Wansford, Wittering, and Wothorpe <b>each</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> parish council. Newborough and Borough Fen merged on 1 April 2012. The city council also works closely with Werrington neighbourhood association which operates on a similar basis to a parish council. Parish elections are held simultaneously on the ordinary day of election of councillors for the district.|$|E
5|$|Of this list's 28 pitchers, three {{share the}} best win–loss record, {{in terms of}} winning percentage: Red Nelson, Jerry Nops, and Eddie Oropesa <b>each</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> 1.000 winning percentage, Nelson having won two games and lost none, and Nops and Oropesa each winning one game without a loss. Al Orth, in his seven seasons as a Phillies, {{accumulated}} 100 victories and 72 defeats, tops in both categories on this list; among pitchers whose surname begins with N, Nichols' 10 wins and Dickie Noles' 11 losses are highest. Orth and Noles also lead their respective lists in strikeouts: Orth with 359, and Noles with 133. Roy Oswalt's 1.74 earned run average (ERA) is the lowest among members of this list; of the pitchers whose surname begins with N, Nichols' 2.83 ERA is best.|$|E

5|$|The {{importance}} of collegiate life {{is such that}} for many students their college JCR (Junior Common Room, for undergraduates) or MCR (Middle Common Room, for graduates) is seen as more important than OUSU. JCRs and MCRs <b>each</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> committee, with a president and other elected students representing their peers to college authorities. Additionally, they organise events and often have significant budgets to spend as they wish (money coming from their colleges and sometimes other sources such as student-run bars). (It {{is worth noting that}} JCR and MCR are terms that are used to refer to rooms for use by members, as well as the student bodies.) Not all colleges use this JCR/MCR structure, for example Wadham College's entire student population is represented by a combined Students' Union and purely graduate colleges have different arrangements.|$|E
5|$|The {{karyotype}} in T.talamancae is variable. Samples {{from two}} different localities in Venezuela have 34chromosomes and a fundamental number of 64 chromosomal arms (2n=34, FN=64). Four specimens from another Venezuelan locality <b>each</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> different karyotype, {{with the number of}} chromosomes ranging from 40 to 42 and the fundamental number from 66 to perhaps 67. The autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) of the 2n=34 karyotype all have two major arms, but the 2n=40–42 karyotypes include several acrocentric autosomes, which only have one major arm. The 2n=34 karyotype includes two large submetacentric pairs, which have two long arms but one distinctly longer than the other, and one pair of subtelocentric chromosomes, with a long and a much shorter arm, but the 2n=40–42 karyotypes lack the submetacentrics and have another pair of subtelocentrics. Both Robertsonian translocations (fusions of the long arm of one chromosome with the long arm of another and the short arm of the one with the short arm of the other) and pericentric inversions (reversals of part of a chromosome that includes the centromere) are needed to explain {{the difference between the two}} groups. Musser and colleagues, in discussing these karyotypes, assumed that the 2n=40–42 sample was from within a hybrid zone between two karyotypic morphs.|$|E
5|$|The prickly shark has a flabby and {{cylindrical}} body, {{with the}} adults markedly bulkier than juveniles, and a short, moderately flattened head. The nostrils are placed far apart and preceded by small flaps of skin. The spiracles are tiny and positioned well behind the eyes, which lack nictitating membranes. The mouth forms a broad arch, with very short furrows at the corners. There are 21–25 and 20–27 tooth rows {{in the upper}} and lower jaws respectively. The knife-like teeth <b>each</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> strongly angled main cusp flanked by up to three smaller cusplets on either side; the lateral cusplets are absent in young sharks.

5|$|As a Northern Igbo city, Enugu shares {{cultural}} traits {{with its}} neighbouring towns. Two important Igbo traditional festivals {{take place in}} Enugu annually; the Mmanwu festival and the New yam festival. The Mmanwu festival takes place in November and features various types of masquerades that <b>each</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> name. This festival is held at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium as a parade of carnival-like masquerades that are accompanied by music and it {{is supported by the}} Enugu Council of Arts and Culture. The second important Igbo festival, the New yam festival known as 'iwa ji', is held between August and October marking the harvesting and feasting of the new yam. The yam is a root vegetable that is the staple crop and a cultural symbol for the Igbo people. Recently created festivals include the Enugu Festival of Arts which is managed by the Enugu Council of Arts and Culture. The festival highlights African culture and traditions and it is here that the Enugu Council of Arts and Culture included the Mmanwu parade as part of the events. The Enugu Festival of Arts was started in 1986; it has modernised the Mmanwu festival by transferring it from its traditional village surroundings to the urban setting of Enugu. Diana, Princess of Wales was a notable spectator of Enugu's cultural shows when she visited the city in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Units <b>each</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{character}} class which determines their weapon, skill set, movement and attack range, {{and how much}} effect they have on other units, whether they used passive or aggressive skills. There are thirty classes available to choose from: these include mounted units such as the Pegasus Knight, Sorcerers and Healers that wield magic for attack and healing respectively, soldiers who wield swords and axes, and archers who specialize in long distance attacks. The only class that is character exclusive is the Lord class, which is used by Marth. Limitations are placed on how many of one class {{can be used in}} a single battle. When a unit has reached Level 10, their class can be evolved along a select number of routes using an item called a Master Seal. Units can also be re-classed, changing to a completely different class or back to their original class at the player's discretion: the re-class options has limits as there are only a limited number of available classes for a unit to change into. If a class change is reversed, all the unit's previous stats will be retained. Each unit's weapon, which is directly associated with its class, has its level raised based on the amount of usage, while also decreasing its durability — unless merged with another identical item, the weapon will break after its maximum number of uses.|$|E
