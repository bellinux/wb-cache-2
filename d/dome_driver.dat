40|$|The {{midrange}} {{driver of}} a loudspeaker system {{has the most}} difficult job: it has to produce the frequencies the human ears are most sensitive to. It is also responsible for handling the major portion of the spectrum comprising the human voice and the fundamental notes emitted by most instruments. Hence it becomes imperative for it to behave well across this entire mid-frequency range. A loudspeaker driver suffers from resonance or ‘ringing’ at various frequencies due to structural limitations. This is {{the primary cause of}} artificial colouration of sound or inaccuracy in reproduction of timbre. This project attempts to detect and analyse the inherent resonant modes of a high fidelity midrange <b>dome</b> <b>driver</b> used in Linn loudspeaker systems using Empirical Mode Decomposition. The measurements have been made using a software programmed in MATLAB for accurate identification of resonant modes. The method described in this thesis provides a different approach for accurately detecting colouration or timbral inaccuracies in loudspeakers due to resonance of the transducer components. Limitations of the conventional FFT spectral analysis methods such as spectrogram and Cumulative Spectral Decay have been reviewed with regard to analysis of colouration...|$|E

500|$|Jackson {{was working}} as an {{entrepreneur}} in digital audio electronics in 1993 when Barbra Streisand's producer asked him to mix her first concert tour in decades. Jackson signed on partly because he was assured he could {{do anything to make}} her concert sound as good as possible. Jackson determined that huge concert venues such as Wembley Stadium and Madison Square Garden would be carpeted for Streisand, and that expensive heavy drapes would be hung at the walls to damp sound reflections. After discovering that Streisand did not like to listen to any stage monitors made after the 1960s, he designed a stage wedge which used soft <b>dome</b> <b>drivers</b> for midrange and for high frequencies rather than the more powerful compression drivers in common use after the 1970s. As well, the main sound system Jackson specified was a new design by Clair Brothers, a proprietary line array system called the I4. Streisand was not willing to wear in-ear monitors but the band was fitted with them, to reduce stage wash and make the band's instruments stand out better individually in the mix. The stage monitors, line array and extravagant acoustic treatments were a hit with Streisand, who said of Jackson that he was [...] "the best sound engineer in the world." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Dome</b> Racing <b>drivers</b> Frédéric Makowiecki and Naoki Yamamoto {{were tied}} on 46 {{points for the}} {{championship}} lead with Impul's João Paulo de Oliveira and Tsugio Matsuda. Following their win in at the 3 Hours of Fuji Team Mugen extended their championship lead in GT300 to 16 points over the Gainer Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG GT3 of Katsuyuki Hiranaka and Björn Wirdheim. With Autopolis being the 2nd last round of the season, instead of having weight ballast equal to {{twice the number of}} points scored in the season, teams that competed in all previous 6 races had their weight ballast reduced to the number of points they scored.|$|R
2500|$|An {{electret}} driver functions {{along the}} same electromechanical means as an electrostatic driver. However the electret driver has a permanent charge built into it, whereas electrostatics have the charge applied to the driver by an external generator. Electret and electrostatic headphones are relatively uncommon. Original electrets were also typically cheaper and lower in technical capability and fidelity than electrostatics. Patent applications from 2009-2013 have been approved that show by using different materials, i.e. a [...] "Fluorinated cyclic olefin electret film", Frequency response chart readings can reach 50kHz [...] at 100db. When these new improved electrets are combined with a traditional <b>dome</b> headphone <b>driver,</b> headphones can be produced that are recognised by the Japan Audio Society as worthy of joining the Hi Res Audio program.

5000|$|The {{first guest}} was Super GT GT500 Nissan Motul Pitwork Z driver Satoshi Motoyama (Top Racer Battle challenger), {{he entered the}} {{dedicated}} [...] "Motoyama Trophy", a 2-lap 10 races online multiplayer competition, and won three rounds. Second guest specially came from France, Sébastien Loeb, LeMans 2005 PlayStation Pescarolo C60 Judd LMP Race Car '04 driver and WRC champion, he set a new Time Attack Internet record on the 24 Hours of Le Mans' Circuit de la Sarthe I ("Loeb Special Attack") and defeated Kazunori Yamauchi in their Pescarolo Online Time Attack duel on the same circuit (Internet rank 10th vs 11th). The last guests were both Top Racer Battle challengers, one is Ryo Michigami, Super GT GT500 Honda Takata <b>Dome</b> NSX <b>driver,</b> the other is Michael Krumm, GT500 Nissan Motul Pitwork Z driver. They competed {{with each other in}} a versus battle then entered a special trophy similar to Motoyama's.|$|R
50|$|The Drift Shop {{does not}} have a {{particular}} location and can be opened at any time except for during a race or while inside one of the other shops in the <b>Driver's</b> <b>Dome.</b> However, it is still important, as this is the only place a player can purchase cosmetic upgrades that contain real performance upgrades, and other kits designed to repair parts. Player can also purchase additional inventory space or additional floors for their garage here. Also, some vehicles can only be bought here, namely the ST class of vehicles and the miniature vehicles line.|$|R
50|$|The F105 was {{launched}} at the Spiral building in Tokyo on March 18, 1996. Marco Apicella, {{who had won}} the 1994 Japanese Formula 3000 championship with <b>Dome,</b> and local <b>drivers</b> Naoki Hattori and Shinji Nakano were selected as the project's test drivers. Apicella and Hattori both had brief experience of competing in F1, whilst Nakano was a Honda protégé who was driving for Dome in F3000. The F105 was tested {{for the first time}} at the Japanese Mine circuit in the spring of 1996, driven by Nakano, before the programme moved to Suzuka in the hand of Apicella. By April, the F105 had completed 550 km and its engine was replaced with a new one. The car reached the 900 km mark in May, by which time a baseline setup had been established. Apicella reported that it tended to oversteer at the entry to corners, understeer on exit, the aerodynamic balance was unstable, and that the car's brakes were spongy. A more serious problem occurred during one of the testing sessions at Suzuka when an oil leak stranded the car out on the circuit and caused a major fire which extensively damaged the F105 chassis.|$|R
2500|$|The top of {{the line}} models were named American GFS (Concord DL two-door), American ECD (Concord DL four-door), and Camioneta American Automática (Concord DL wagon). All three {{featured}} automatic transmissions, power brakes, power steering, [...] six-cylinder (258 on ECD) with new-for-the-year Motorcraft two-barrel carburetor and 8.0:1 compression ratio, 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio, light group (courtesy, ashtray, glovebox, hood and trunk; the last one unavailable on the wagon), custom steering wheel, woodgrain panels on dashboard, parcel shelf, clock, retractable seat belts, luxury upholstery, tinted windshield, bright molding package (wheel arches, drip rails, rocker panels, front hood edge, hood ornament), engine displacement [...] "4.6" [...] emblems ("4.2" [...] on ECD), wheel covers, and bumper guards. The GFS model included a floor-shift transmission and reclining individual high-back seats, while the ECD and automatic wagon had column-shift coupled with a bench front seat. Both sedan models incorporated vinyl roof either in full form (ECD) or Landau type (GFS). The most unusual looking of these models in contrast with AMC's versions was the GFS model as it incorporated the flip-open rear side opera windows and the targa band used in the 1977 AMC Hornet AMX models (the same treatment used in the Hornet-based 1977 VAM American GFS). The optional equipment list on these models included air conditioning system with heavy duty cooling (seven-blade flexible fan, three-line radiator, fan shroud, coolant recovery tank and 55 amp alternator), reading <b>dome</b> light, remote-controlled <b>driver's</b> side mirror, passenger's side remote mirror, and rear defroster.|$|R
