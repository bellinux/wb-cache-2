40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to develop a new class of finite {{elements}} on quadrilaterals and hexahedra. The degrees of freedom are the values at the vertices and the approximation is polynomial on each element K. In general, with this kind of finite elements, the resolution of second order elliptic problems leads to non-conform approximations. Degrees of freedom are the same than those of isoparametric finite elements. And, in the particular case when the finite elements are parallelotopes, our method <b>is</b> <b>conform</b> and coincides with the classical finite elements on structured meshes.

30|$|When TN {{congestion}} {{is detected}} the FC dominates the behavior. During {{this time the}} flows are regulated according to an algorithm, which <b>is</b> <b>conform</b> with the additive increase multiplicative decrease (AIMD) property. In [23], it is shown that AIMD guarantees convergence to fairness; all flows converge to an equal share of resources in steady state, where no flows join or leave. A multiplication with a coefficient provides the multiplicative decrease and a constant increase rate after reduction provides the additive increase property. The AIMD property is met only for the serving cell behavior. However, a MAC-e PDU is normally received in the serving-cell with a higher probability, thus the end-user fairness {{is dominated by the}} serving-cell behavior.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—An {{optimization}} {{scheme of}} the leakage current reduction (LCR) for SRAM design {{has been proposed}} in this letter. By choosing the enabling signals for the LCR circuits intentionally, it can be deduced theoretically that there exists an optimal design option for the LCR technique application under the premise of SRAM performance re-quirement. Assuming that the reliably of SA sense requires 100 mV differential voltage of bitlines, {{and the number of}} bitcells attached to one bitline is 2048, the simulate results shows that the discharging rate under the value of 256 of k is the fastest which <b>is</b> <b>conform</b> to the theoretical calculation, which means the most significant reduction of leakage current.

A favorable response to minority participation (i. e., "alternative conformity") helps decrease the influence of dominant players, alter the resource suppliers' social structure, and promote new logics, which makes alternative conformity a "son control strategy" for organizations. We expect {{a positive relationship between}} minority participation and alternative conformity and expect that relationship to be attenuated by organizations' adherence to a dominant logic, the centrality of minority logic holders, and a minority logic's institutional credit.
