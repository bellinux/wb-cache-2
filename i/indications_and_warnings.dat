40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThis thesis examines {{the feasibility of}} passively fingerprinting network reconnaissance tools. Detecting reconnaissance is a key early <b>indication</b> <b>and</b> <b>warning</b> of an adversary's impending attack or intelligence gathering effort against a network. Current network defense tools provide little capability to detect, and much less specifically identify, network reconnaissance. This thesis introduces a methodology for identifying a network reconnaissance tool's unique fingerprint. The methodology confirmed the utility of previous research on visual fingerprints, produced characteristic summary tables, and introduced the application of TCP sequence number analysis to reconnaissance tool fingerprinting. We demonstrate {{the use of these}} methods to fingerprint network reconnaissance tools used in a real-world Cyber Defense Exercise scenario. US Navy (USN) author...|$|R

50|$|The ES-3A Shadow was {{designed}} as a carrier-based, subsonic, all-weather, long-range, electronic reconnaissance (ELINT) aircraft. 16 aircraft were modified, replacing the EA-3B Skywarrior, and entering fleet service in 1993. The ES-3A carried an extensive suite of electronic sensors and communications gear, replacing the S-3's submarine detection, armament, and maritime surveillance equipment with avionics racks accommodating the ES-3A's sensors. These modifications had minor impact on airspeed, reducing its top rated speed from 450 KTAS to 405 KTAS but had no noticeable impact on the aircraft's range and actually increased its rated loiter time. Because these aircraft were standoff <b>indications</b> <b>and</b> <b>warnings</b> platforms and were never intended to be part of an ingress strike package, this new speed limitation was considered insignificant.|$|E

The proposed algorithms and PHM system technology are applied for diagnosis of mechanical flows in a high speed rotating gear of a demonstrator machine. A detailed description of data management and rooting from vibration sensors to the processing unit will be exposed. Finally, a proof-of-concept experiment will be designed to demonstrate the integration of all the described system elements to detect any damage or anomaly into the monitored structure. 1...|$|R
