500|$|By late 1985, Rangel {{was in a}} six-person race {{to become}} the next House Majority Whip, the third-highest ranked {{position}} in the House {{and for the first time}} up for election by the members rather than appointment by the Speaker. By October 1986 the race was heating up, with Rangel the underdog coming close to Representative Tony Coelho from California through use of his personal skills and Rangel arguing that the Democratic leadership needed better regional balance. However, in December 1986, Coelho defeated Rangel in the whip election, 167–78. Rangel attributed his loss to Coelho having funded the campaigns of many House members via his role as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, later saying, “I had never been so goddamn naive.

60|$|Now {{they had}} reached us and there began the most terrible battle that was told of {{in the history of}} that land. Wave after wave of them rolled up against us, but our battalions which I had not trained in vain stood like rocks and slew and slew and slew till the dead could be counted by the thousand. Again and again they strove to storm the hill on which I stood, hoping to kill me, and each time we beat them back. Picking out their generals I loosed shaft after shaft from my long bow, and seldom <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>miss,</b> nor could their cotton-quilted armour turn those bitter arrows.|$|E
60|$|While {{looking up}} at the image of a white ibis, fixed on a column--while fathoming the deep, torch-lit {{perspective}} of an avenue, at the close of which was couched a sphinx--I lost sight of the party which, {{from the middle of the}} great square, I had followed--or, rather, they vanished like a group of apparitions. On this whole scene was impressed a dream-like character: every shape was wavering, every movement floating, every voice echo-like--half-mocking, half-uncertain. Paulina and her friends being gone, I scarce could avouch that I had really seen them; nor <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> them as guides through the chaos, far less regret them as protectors amidst the night.|$|E

David Nusair of Reel Film Reviews panned the movie heavily and {{described it as}} [...] "bad, incompetently made and with virtually no redeeming qualities." [...] DVD Talk was also heavily critical of {{all aspects of the}} film, especially its title, and commented [...] "Single White Female 2: The Psycho? Is that the title? <b>Did</b> <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> something? In the original Single White Female, did Jennifer Jason Leigh not play a psycho? Or maybe there was a Single White Female 1.5 in which all the pretty roommates did nothing but drink tea and give each other perms." [...] DVD Verdict also panned the film and advised any potential viewers to avoid the movie as it was [...] "the original movie minus all of the good stuff".|$|E

40|$|TO THE EDITOR: Levine (1) makes several unreferenced {{statements}} {{at variance}} with my research into Taft’s obstructive sleep apnea (2). Because Taft’s papers comprise more than 700 000 lightly indexed documents, key documents can easily go unfound. I am hoping for clarification of 5 points. First, was Taft really 6 feet, 2 inches tall? He self-reports his height as 5 feet, 11. 5 inches in an insurance application filed in 1900 (3). Second, Levine reports that Taft weighed 354 pounds in 1909 and 280 pounds at death. I uncovered no primary documentation for a weight more than “ 335 to 340 pounds ” (4), and the definitive Taft biography (5) says that he weighed 244 pounds 12 months before dying—his lowest weight since age 27 years. Third, <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> a letter trove reflecting an “extensive ” corre-spondence lasting 10 years? From autumn 1906 through 1914, Taf...|$|E
40|$|Our {{patients}} often carry heavy burdens {{into the}} examination room. With our standard questioning, we medically divide and define them into recognizable parts, but as {{pieces of a}} whole they resist healing. Can we regain a vision of health beyond the isolated individual to one who might belong to a larger community of concern? (J Am Board Fam Med 2010; 23 : 121 – 123.) I recently received a voicemail message that both surprised and disturbed me. A patient {{called to say that}} she was discharging me as her doctor. It had never really happened before in such a formal way. Although patients come and go, and their leaving is probably at times an indirect expression of rejec-tion, this message was anything but subtle. Al-though I was partly relieved, given her dissatisfac-tion with my ability to help her, I felt the shock of an acutely ruptured relationship.

40|$|A serious–minded {{journalist}} presenter on breakfast radio (hullo, Fran) made {{a critical}} differentiation one morning earlier this week. It {{was just a}} link, a throw between subjects, so I can 2 ̆ 7 t find the words on any podcast or transcript, but they went something like this: " [...] . apart from politics, there 2 ̆ 7 s also policy [...] .

And it 2 ̆ 7 s true, politics and policy are now almost formally separate entities [...] . this is accepted in the routine analysis of the Gillard Government: that it is achieving well in terms of policy and reform, but failing utterly in the daily political battle to present a coherent and convincing public face. Surely the problem is one of priority? Forgive the naivety of the question, but when and why did the pure politics become more important? How did this become the inevitable focus of attention?

40|$|Postwar social theorists (Goldthorpe, Lipset, Giddens, Hout, Brooks and Manza) have {{typically}} portrayed {{members of the}} Western industrial working-class as accommodative and suggest that an affluent proletariat has seen its oppositional working-class consciousness subverted and transformed by the ‘cash nexus ’ into various forms of social integration. With reference to Mann’s (1973) measures of class-consciousness I explore expressions of proletarian consciousness among organized workers at one of Canada’s largest industrial union locals, the Canadian Auto Workers Local 222 of General Motors, Oshawa, Canada. Here I tested for the existence and degree of working-class imagery, proletarian identity and oppositional working-class consciousness using a survey questionnaire (N= 102), in-depth interviews and participant observation. I found a shared view of class relations as primarily characterized by conflict, a clear working-class self-identification and measurable forms of oppositional working-class consciousness among this group. My findings confirm the hypothesis that Oshawa autoworkers ’ relative material advantage is insufficient to completely transform their proletarian consciousness. In this context I discuss the 1996 Oshawa plant occupation {{as an example of}} elevated oppositional class consciousness among Oshawa autoworkers. PERSONAL REFLEXIVE STATEMENT While working as an autoworker on the General Motors assembly line from 1984 - 1991, I often reflected on the existence and character of class consciousness. Having read Marx and Lenin in my teens I ‘knew ’ that I should be able to find it—if only I looked hard enough. Where was Marx’s revolutionary proletarian consciousness? Was it to be found at union meetings? <b>Did</b> <b>I</b> <b>miss</b> it while in conversation with my fellow workers? Was it an issue in the many shop-floor skirmishes I participated in? But after seven years of working on the line...|$|E
