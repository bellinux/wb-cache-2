5|$|Margarito, {{traditionally}} {{a sluggish}} starter, anticipated to emerge swift, {{but it was}} Cotto who {{got off to a}} more effective start by throwing numerous punches and applying plenty of movement. Cotto picked up where he left off in the second round, approaching directly at Margarito though easily <b>getting</b> <b>by</b> harm's way once Margarito sought to counterpunch. That, nevertheless, changed approximately a minute into the round, as Margarito landed a right hand that momentarily had Cotto by the ropes. Margarito directed his assault to Cotto's body, but Cotto landed various left hooks. Blood started descending from Cotto's nose, but did not discourage him from closing the round by landing a punch upon Margarito. Mobility represented the key for Cotto in the third round, efficaciously blending boxing and brawling while trying to minimize the blood flow from his nose and a small cut over his left eye. Margarito continued targeting the body, but drew two distinguish warnings for low blows in the span of less than a minute. Margarito closed the gap sufficiency in the fourth round by landing a right uppercut and attacking Cotto's body to slow him down. In the fifth round, Cotto provided plenty of lateral movement which frustrated Margarito. Cotto persisted on the move and would land a flurry of punches prior to directly escaping harm's way. Margarito landed a straight right hand that had Cotto temporarily unsteady with ten seconds to go, but Cotto eluded all of the ensuing punches until the final bell.|$|E

On the final lap, Carl Edwards was about to hold off Ambrose for the tenth position, but got loose in the final turn to the finish line, causing Ambrose to slip by to steal the tenth spot and lock Edwards {{out of the top}} ten finishers. This fight for tenth place resembled a reverse style of Ambrose's race at Montreal in 2009, which ended with Edwards <b>getting</b> <b>by</b> him on the final lap.|$|E

25|$|In 1991, Bickley and Warren {{launched}} their own production plate, Bickley-Warren Productions, as associates to Miller/Boyett. The Bickley-Warren Productions entity oversaw Family Matters, Step by Step and <b>Getting</b> <b>By</b> for Miller/Boyett, and alone were later {{the producers of}} Hangin' With Mr. Cooper and Kirk, {{both of which were}} produced by Warner Bros. Television (which absorbed Lorimar Television in 1993).

25|$|Hill took pole {{position}} {{in front of}} his home crowd in Britain ahead of Schumacher, Berger, Alesi, Häkkinen and Barrichello. There was controversy as Schumacher passed Hill on the parade lap, not permitted under the regulations, and then let him resume first position before they came back to the grid to form up. The first start was aborted when Coulthard (returning to the Williams team) stalled on the grid and was forced to start from the back. Irvine retired on the second parade lap with engine problems and at the second start, Brundle's engine blew in a spectacular ball of fire. At the start, Barrichello was the man on the move, <b>getting</b> <b>by</b> Alesi and Häkkinen. Hill led Schumacher, Berger, Barrichello, Alesi and Häkkinen.|$|E
25|$|The {{extremely}} bumpy Hermanos Rodriguez Autodrome in Mexico saw {{a number}} of incidents during practice, including Senna crashing at the very fast Peraltada while trying to take it a bit faster than usual and his car overturned when it hit the tire barrier. Senna had come to Mexico City with a head injury that he got while jetskiing in Brazil, and had {{been critical of the}} dusty circuit's condition all through the weekend. Williams took 1–2 in qualifying with Patrese ahead of Mansell, Senna, Alesi, Berger and Piquet. Patrese made a poor start and lost three places while Alesi dived ahead of Senna. The order was: Mansell, Alesi, Senna, Patrese, Berger and Piquet. There was action as Senna passed Alesi with Patrese following him through and then Modena <b>getting</b> <b>by</b> Piquet.|$|E

He claims {{that he is going to}} spend his vacation in the mountains, and elaborates that he is talking about the pawnbroking institution known as muntele de pietate (from the French for [...] "Mountain of Piety"; see Mont de Piété). Mitică enters a restaurant to order only things which he knows are free ("a toothpick, a match, a glass of water and a newspaper").

500|$|Although Sylvain said Rundgren {{was not an}} interfering producer, he {{occasionally}} involved himself to improve a take. Sylvain recalled moments when Rundgren went into the isolation booth with Nolan when he struggled keeping a beat and drummed out beats on a cowbell for him {{to use as a}} click track. During another session, he stopped a take {{and walked out of the}} control room to plug in Kane's bass cabinet. Scoppa, who paid afternoon visits to the studio, overheard Rundgren say, [...] "Yeah, that's all you needed. Okay, let's try it again!", and ultimately found the exchange funny and indicative of Rundgren's opinion of the band: [...] "Todd was such a 'musician' while they were just <b>getting</b> <b>by</b> on attitude and energy. But as disdainful as he appeared to be at some points he got the job done really well." [...] Rundgren felt Johansen's wild singing often sounded screamed or drunken but were eloquent in the sense that Johansen demonstrated a [...] "propensity to incorporate certain cultural references into the music", particularly on [...] "Personality Crisis". While recording the song, Johansen walked back into the control room and asked Rundgren if his vocals sounded [...] "ludicrous enough".|$|E
500|$|During the 1890s, Elgar {{gradually}} {{built up}} {{a reputation as a}} composer, chiefly of works for the great choral festivals of the English Midlands. The Black Knight (1892) and King Olaf (1896), both inspired by Longfellow, The Light of Life (1896) and Caractacus (1898) were all modestly successful, and he obtained a long-standing publisher in Novello and Co. Other works of this decade included the Serenade for Strings (1892) and Three Bavarian Dances (1897). Elgar was of enough consequence locally to recommend the young composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor to the Three Choirs Festival for a concert piece, which helped establish the younger man's career. Elgar was catching the attention of prominent critics, but their reviews were polite rather than enthusiastic. Although he was in demand as a festival composer, he was only just <b>getting</b> <b>by</b> financially and felt unappreciated. In 1898, he said he was [...] "very sick at heart over music" [...] and hoped {{to find a way to}} succeed with a larger work. His friend August Jaeger tried to lift his spirits: [...] "A day's attack of the blues ... will not drive away your desire, your necessity, which is to exercise those creative faculties which a kind providence has given you. Your time of universal recognition will come." ...|$|E
