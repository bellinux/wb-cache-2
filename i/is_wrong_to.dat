25|$|While a principle-based {{approach}} might {{claim that}} lying is always morally wrong, the casuist would argue that, {{depending upon the}} details of the case, lying might or might not be illegal or unethical. The casuist might conclude that a person <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> lie in legal testimony under oath, but might argue that lying actually is the best moral choice if the lie saves a life. (Thomas Sanchez and others thus theorized a doctrine of mental reservation, which developed into its own branch of casuistry.) For the casuist, the circumstances of a case are essential for evaluating the proper response.|$|E

25|$|David Miller {{has criticized}} {{this kind of}} {{criticism}} by Salmon and others because it makes inductivist assumptions. Popper does not say that corroboration is an indicator of predictive power. The predictive power is in the theory itself, not in its corroboration. The rational motivation for choosing a well-corroborated theory {{is that it is}} simply easier to falsify: Well-corroborated means that at least one kind of experiment (already conducted at least once) could have falsified (but did not actually falsify) the one theory, while the same kind of experiment, regardless of its outcome, could not have falsified the other. So it is rational to choose the well-corroborated theory: It may not be more likely to be true, but if it is actually false, it is easier to get rid of when confronted with the conflicting evidence that will eventually turn up. Accordingly, it <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> consider corroboration as a reason, a justification for believing in a theory or as an argument in favor of a theory to convince someone who objects to it.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, {{something}} that is somewhat unusual in Japanese custody arrangements is the system of koseki, which legally defines households and persons' legal identity in Japanese law. When a non-Japanese marries a Japanese, the foreign spouse's name is recorded into Japanese spouse's koseki upon filing of the marriage, but the spouse's entry is not created in the koseki {{because of lack of}} Japanese citizenship. When their child is born, because the child has Japanese citizenship, an entry is created for the child in the Japanese spouse's koseki. There is a widespread misunderstanding that when a divorce occurs, the foreign spouse is removed from the koseki and the children's custody is automatically kept by the Japanese spouse who hold the koseki. Koseki and custody are not related. The confusion is increased by the fact that completely uncontested divorces are performed not by a court, but by the spouses simply filling out a family registry form at the city hall. When a divorce is finalized at the city hall, the name of the custodial parent of each child must be written in the filing. The name of the custodial parent is then recorded in each child's entry in the koseki. Therefore, it <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> assume that unless custody is litigated in Japan, the Japanese parent will automatically hold custody of children in Japan, irrespective of the ruling of the foreign court. A divorce is not finalized in Japan unless custody is agreed to by the spouses or determined by the Japanese court. Furthermore, it is also wrong, but common, to assume that if the custodial parent dies, custody of the child is transferred within the koseki, which would mean that custody would be retained by the dead spouse's new married partner or Japanese grandparents who retain their custody as primary caregiver and would not be transferred to the surviving parent. When a sole custodial parent dies, the family court starts the procedure of appointing a guardian unless one has been designated in the will of the custodial parent.|$|E
500|$|Coursing {{has long}} sparked {{opposition}} from activists concerned about animal welfare. In 1892, Lady Florence Dixie criticised hare coursing as an [...] "aggravated form of torture" [...] and the League Against Cruel Sports {{was established in}} 1924 to campaign against rabbit coursing on Morden Common and continues {{to believe that it}} <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> expose animals to the risk of injury or death for human entertainment. The Waterloo Cup became a centrepiece of the campaign against coursing in the UK. In opposition, coursing has long enjoyed the fame of being known as [...] "the noblest of field sports" [...] precisely because the death of the hare is not the aim of the sport. Under most regulated forms of coursing only two hounds pursue the hare, the dogs competing against each other for a short time, and allowing the hare a significant chance of escape.|$|E

500|$|Andrews found Cardozo's {{reasoning}} too narrow, {{and felt}} that the focus {{should be on the}} unreasonable act: driving down Broadway at high speed is negligent whether or not an accident occurs.

[...] "Due care is a duty imposed on each one of us to protect society from unnecessary danger, not to protect A, B or C alone... In an empty world, negligence would not exist. It does involve a relationship between man and his fellows. But not merely a relationship between man and those whom he might reasonably expect his act would injure. Rather, a relationship between him and those whom he does in fact injure. If his act has a tendency to harm some one, it harms him a mile away as surely as it does those on the scene." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, she spoke the {{required}} words of repentance for political abuse of psychiatry which had had unprecedented dimensions in the Soviet Union for discrediting, intimidation and {{suppression of the}} human rights movement carried out primarily in this institution. Her words were widely broadcast abroad but were published only in the St. Petersburg newspaper Chas Pik within the country. However, in her 2001 book Aliyans Prava i Milosediya (The Alliance of Law and Mercy), Dmitrieva wrote that there were no psychiatric abuses and certainly no more than in Western countries. Moreover, the book makes the charge that professor Vladimir Serbsky and other intellectuals were wrong not to cooperate with the police department in preventing revolution and bloodsheds and that the current generation <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> oppose the regime. In 2007, Dmitrieva asserted that the practice of [...] "punitive psychiatry" [...] had been grossly exaggerated, while nothing wrong had been done by the Serbsky Institute. After that an official at the Serbsky Institute declared [...] "patient" [...] Vladimir Bukovsky, who was then going to run for the President of the Russian Federation, undoubtedly [...] "psychopathic".|$|E
500|$|Halfway {{through the}} school year, Ali's family moves to the more {{peaceful}} Kurdish region in Northern Iraq but after living there for several months, Ali {{says that he is}} homesick and misses the action and noise of Baghdad. Mohammad, feeling lonely, [...] "adopts" [...] a bird with a broken wing and a mouse he finds in the house. This brings him some comfort, but his mother later demands that he get rid of the mouse as she does not want [...] "vermin" [...] in the house. Mohammad's family rejoice when Saddam Hussein is sentenced, and feel that his later execution was justified, as to do otherwise would have made the Iraqi people look weak. Conversely, Anmar's family is upset at his execution, as they feel that the people who came into power were no better than Hussein was. Hyder's mother says that many Iraqi people were hopeful about the arrival of American forces, and that it <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> blame America for all of the problems in Iraq. She notes that the bloodshed has yet to stop as the Sunni continues to kill the Shiite, and vice versa. As the film continues, Hyder's family loses its income and they start to sell their furniture to earn extra money.|$|E

500|$|The Welsh Secretary, Peter Hain, who had {{appealed to}} the BBC Trust to have Griffin's {{appearance}} prevented, continued to denounce the decision. David Lammy, one of Britain's first black ministers, feared that people would face violence {{as a result of}} the programme. The former Home Secretary, David Blunkett, attacked the way in which BBC News at Six engaged in [...] "deliberate promotion of their own publicity-seeking decision", opining that [...] "the only people who have benefited from this row are the BNP and the BBC's Question Time ratings". The Conservative Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, responded to Griffin's complaints about the location by defending London's diversity, urging residents to [...] "reject their narrow, extremist and offensive views at every opportunity". Anshel Pfeffer, commenting for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, noted the relative silence of UK Jewish groups over the BNP appearance, and praised the BBC's decision to give the BNP a voice, stating: [...] "The BBC is right to have Griffin and other racists on its most respectable shows; it <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> apologise. By doing so it is simply fulfilling its democratic and journalistic duties." [...] Pfeffer compared and contrasted this with Israeli freedom-of-speech laws, and questioned whether Hitler could have risen to power in modern times given the media's scrutiny of democratic politicians.|$|E
500|$|Schmidt criticises Cochrane's liberty {{thesis on}} the grounds that nonhuman animals may have a {{non-specific}} instrumental interest in freedom, meaning that although freedom is not intrinsically valuable for these animals, it may be that they can achieve other things that are intrinsically valuable only through possessing freedom. Thus, Cochrane's thesis underestimates the value that freedom could have for nonhuman animals. Hadley criticises Cochrane's non-pragmatic approach, arguing that Cochrane, as an animal advocate, <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> deny that nonhuman animals possess an [...] "intrinsic" [...] interest in freedom. Hadley links freedom to the value of nonhuman animals, arguing that the latter can be undermined by arguing against the former. Garner criticises Cochrane's thesis {{on the grounds}} that Cochrane has, Garner claims, underestimated the weight of the argument from marginal cases. To the extent that Cochrane's argument works for nonhuman animals, Garner suggests, it will also work for many humans, leading to counter-intuitive consequences. Garner ties autonomy not merely to liberty, but also life, which means that Cochrane's argument would imply that some humans have less of an interest in life than others. Nonetheless, Garner argues that Cochrane's liberty thesis is not destructive of animal rights, and that animal rights positions can still make claims of significance without endorsing the claim that nonhuman animal use is, in itself, problematic. Indeed, merely a right against suffering, Garner suggests, could go a long way towards achieving the abolitionist goal of the end of animal industry. All three authors praise Cochrane for drawing attention to the previously under-examined issue.|$|E
