5|$|My love is {{stronger}} than it's ever been, even though my love may seem to have diminished. I do not love less, even though I don't show it as much. Love becomes a commodity when it's spoken of too highly and too frequently. I used to sing my praises very frequently when our love was new, like the nightingale which sings {{in the summer and}} stops at summers end. It's not that the summer is less pleasant for the nightingale, it's simply that the songs of other birds <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> and when things become common, they become less dear. It's for this reason, I, like the nightingale, have stopped writing. I do not wish my poems to become boring.|$|E
