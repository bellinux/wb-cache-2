Cooking is one of the most ancient parts of {{everyday}} activities and a pressure cooker has evolved to be an integral part of it. The main aim here is to eliminate confusions involved in keeping a count of the whistles. The heart of this design is the missing <b>pulse</b> <b>detector,</b> an application of 555 timers. This circuit detects the whistle frequency and gives a non-oscillating output and a decision is made considering this as the criterion for further processing.

5000|$|Funic souffle (funicular souffle, foetal souffle) is a sharp, {{whistling}} {{sound that}} is synchronous with {{the pulse of}} the foetus, usually heard during the second trimester of pregnancy (13-28 weeks). It is heard because of the rush of blood through the umbilical arteries of the foetus, and is therefore synchronous with the <b>foetal</b> <b>pulse.</b> The funic souffle is not heard consistently. On auscultation, funic souffle may often be confused with uterine souffle, which is a soft, blowing sound synchronous with the maternal pulse. Therefore, the maternal pulse must be palpated simultaneously in order to differentiate uterine souffle from funic souffle.|$|R

40|$|Fundamento. La pulsioximetría, técnica que mide de forma {{continua}} la saturación de oxígeno en sangre (%SpO 2), se ha convertido en un método de monitorización estándar en anestesia, cuidados intensivos, neonatología, etc., pudiendo {{llegar a}} ser útil a los obstetras en la monitorización del bienestar fetal durante el parto. Tiene la ventaja de ser mínimamente invasiva y fácil de usar. La saturación de hemoglobina fetal oxigenada es un buen parámetro para medir el contenido-déficit fetal de oxígeno. Una saturación menor del 30 % durante un periodo de tiempo superior a 10 minutos se correlaciona con una pHmetría de micromuestra de cuero cabelludo fetal Pulse oximetry {{is a technique}} that continuously measures the blood oxygen saturation (%SpO 2); {{it has become a}} standard monitoring method in Anaesthesia, Intensive Care, Neonatology, etc; and it can be helpful in Obstetrics during delivery to monitor foetal welfare. Its advantages are that it is minimally invasive and easy to use. Moreover, SpO 2 is a good parameter for measuring oxygen carriage. A saturation below 30 % during a time period over 10 minutes is correlated with an acid-base equilibrium (ABE) of foetal scalp blood sample below 7. 20, and it is predictive of worse perinatal outcomes. The objectives are: 1. The combined use of both techniques (<b>foetal</b> <b>pulse</b> oximetry and ABE), provides equivalent perinatal outcomes but decreases the Caesarean Intrapartum Rate due to suspicion of a loss of foetal welfare. 2. A correlation was found between <b>foetal</b> <b>pulse</b> oximetry and acid-base equilibrium data such as pH, pO 2 and EB. Subjects and methods. Data was gathered on two groups of eighty patients. In the first group we carried out a follow up of delivery under serialized pH-metry, and in the other group, control of the foetuses was carried out in a combined form with pHmetry and pulse oximetry. Results. Statistically significant results were obtained concerning delivery in the comparative study of both groups. Following the perinatal results obtained, the data indicates that there are {{no significant differences between the}} two groups in the pH values of the umbilical artery or in the Apgar values at one and five minutes after delivery, for which reason both protocols are equally satisfactory. The correlation of the data obtained by pH-metry with those of pulse oximetry was statistically significant. Conclusions. The combined use of both techniques increases the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnosis of suspected loss of foetal intrapartum welness, without worsening perinatal outcomes, decreasing the Caesarean Intrapartum Rate due to pathological or non-reassuring foetal electronic monitoring. There is a significant statistical correlation between the results from the <b>foetal</b> <b>pulse</b> oximeter and the values obtained from the foetal scalp blood sample and from the umbilical cord at birth...|$|R
30|$|The {{accuracy}} of peak pulse measurement would thus be affected in that PD <b>pulse</b> <b>detector</b> would respond more favorably to pulses having rapid rise-times.

40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that an {{effective}} search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) presents a signal processing task with unusual requirements.

40|$|A robust {{cellular}} counter {{could enable}} synthetic biologists to design complex circuits with diverse behaviors. The existing synthetic-biological counters, {{responsive to the}} beginning of the pulse, are sensitive to the pulse duration. Here we present a pulse detecting circuit that responds only at the falling edge of a pulse-analogous to negative edge triggered electric circuits. As biological events do not follow precise timing, use of such a <b>pulse</b> <b>detector</b> would enable the design of robust asynchronous counters which can count the completion of events. This transcription-based pulse detecting circuit depends on the interaction of two co-expressed lambdoid phage-derived proteins: the first is unstable and inhibits the regulatory activity of the second, stable protein. At the end of the pulse the unstable inhibitor protein disappears from the cell and the second protein triggers the recording of the event completion. Using stochastic simulation we showed that the proposed design can detect the completion of the pulse irrespective to the pulse duration. In our simulation we also showed that fusing the <b>pulse</b> <b>detector</b> with a phage lambda memory element we can construct a counter which can be extended to count larger numbers. The proposed design principle is a new control mechanism for synthetic biology which can be integrated in different circuits for identifying the completion of an event...|$|R

40|$|Using Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) for {{the purpose}} of {{fluorescence}} lifetime measurements is usually limited in speed due to pile-up. With modern instrumentation this limitation can be lifted significantly but some artefacts due to frequent merging of closely spaced <b>detector</b> <b>pulses</b> (<b>detector</b> <b>pulse</b> pile-up) remains an issue to be addressed. We propose here a data analysis method correcting for this type of artefact and the resulting systematic errors. It physically models the photon losses due to <b>detector</b> <b>pulse</b> pile-up and incorporates the loss in the decay fit model employed to obtain fluorescence lifetimes and relative amplitudes of the decay components. Comparison of results with and without this correction show a significant reduction of systematic errors at count rates approaching the excitation rate.
