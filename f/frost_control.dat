40|$|Quantification {{of frost}} damage risk is {{important}} in planning {{the development of new}} orchard areas and for decision-making on design and installation of <b>frost</b> <b>control</b> systems. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a comprehensive method to quantify frost damage risk in different sweet cherry production areas of South Patagonia and to estimate the potential impact of <b>frost</b> <b>control</b> systems on risk reduction. Lack of historical weather data required a theoretical-empirical approach. Frost damage for any specific day of the season was assumed to occur when the minimum temperature on that day was below the specific lethal temperature for the phenological stage predicted at that moment (based on phenological models). Frost damage probability was estimated for each production location of South Patagonia as the frequency of seasons in which at least one damaging frost (damaging 90 % of the reproductive organs) occurs, at any time during the growing season until harvest. Frost damage risk was compared among cultivars and locations. Finally, the effect of active <b>frost</b> <b>control</b> methods on frost damage risk reduction was analyzed. There was very little difference in frost damage risk among cultivars, although 'Sunburst' was the cultivar with the lowest risk. The most risky locations were Los Antiguos and Esquel, while Comodoro Rivadavia was the safest location. The frequency of years with at least one killing frost decreased dramatically when the minimum temperature was increased by 3 °C, using active <b>frost</b> <b>control</b> systems. The methodology presented appears useful to identify the main and secondary variables affecting frost damage risk. Thus, this type of quantitative analysis can support growers in decision-making on required investments and operational costs of the equipment for <b>frost</b> <b>control,</b> on the basis of potential impact of a particular control system on mean yields and yield stability.

To address this issue, wheat has been co-transformed via micro-projectile bombardment with an antifreeze protein (AFP) gene targeted to the apoplast or endoplasmic reticulum. T 0 transgenic plants expressed AFP and showed the potential for frost tolerance in in vitro tests on plant extracts (Khanna and Daggard 2005). Additional transgenic wheat plants carrying the AFP gene targeted to both apoplast and ER have subsequently been produced. DNA extracted from plants surviving selection on phosphinothricin revealed 63. 8 % were PCR positive for presence of the AFP gene, indicating a wheat transformation frequency of 3. 97 %. Co-transformation of AFP and bar genes occurred in 53 % of samples tested.

The microbial flora upon the early. sown S. tuberosum var. Jersey Royal did not contain INA bacterial species active at warm sub-zero temperatures. Plants inoculated with a strain of Ps. syringae (84 : 27) containing type 1 active nuclei readily froze at - 2 to - 3 ºC. Applications of leaf surface water applied to plants during in-vitro frost tests resulted in nucleation temperatures comparable to those measured in the field. Applications of leaf surface water initiated freezing in whole plants during in-vitro frost tests at temperatures warmer than those caused by Ps. syringae (84 : 27).

40|$|In South Patagonia, {{development}} of the fruit production sector has been almost exclusively based on the production of sweet cherry, with an area increase from 176 ha in 1997 to 578 ha {{at the end of}} 2006. These orchards are designed as intensive systems and oriented to export markets. Even though sweet cherry seems currently the most profitable crop in the region, other crops may be interesting to increase the use efficiency of the resources, to complement income and to spread risk. The general objective of this thesis was to assess constraints and opportunities for fruit production systems in Chubut and Santa Cruz Provinces, with emphasis on sweet cherry. In the context of cherry production for export, it is important to define fruit quality and how this can be affected. Although quality has different meanings for different stakeholders, consumer acceptance seems {{to be the most important}} factor to be considered, but independent of consumer liking, firmness is a key aspect for marketing cherries overseas. To estimate the optimal combination of yield and fruit quality, a “target-tree” approach to maximize gross value of product (GVP) at farm gate was developed and applied to cherry orchards, integrating eco-physiological information, model estimates and expert knowledge. Minimum fruit quality thresholds define the suitable market for the fruit, with their associated price ranges. In addition, on both domestic and export markets, price depends mainly on fruit size. The fruit number to leaf area ratio determines fruit quality (and indirectly fruit price), but in combination with mean fruit weight and leaf area index, also yield. GVP is calculated as the product of yield and fruit price. Quantification of frost damage risk is important in planning the {{development of}} new orchards and to decide on design and installation of <b>frost</b> <b>control</b> systems. Therefore, a comprehensive method to quantify frost damage risk was developed and the potential impact of <b>frost</b> <b>control</b> systems on risk reduction was estimated. Frost damage for any specific day of the season was assumed to occur when the minimum temperature on that day was below the specific lethal temperature for the phenological stage predicted at that moment. Frost damage probability was estimated for each production location of the region as the frequency of years in which at least one damaging frost occurs, at any time during the growing season until harvest. Frost damage risk was compared among cultivars and locations, and also the effect of active <b>frost</b> <b>control</b> methods on frost damage risk reduction was analyzed. Due to the long lifespan of orchard systems, an explorative modelling study was performed. OPTIFROP is a dynamic farm model, developed as an Interactive Multiple Goal Linear Program, capable of allocating, throughout the time horizon of the run, production activities to different land units, while optimizing different (conflicting) objectives, subject to several constraints. For deriving land use options and quantifying the TCs, a software called FRUPAT was developed. This allows combining crop-tree species, edaphic environment, training, irrigation and <b>frost</b> <b>control</b> system, and moment of installation of the <b>frost</b> <b>control</b> system. Feasible land use options were completely characterised by their inputs and outputs at each orchard age until their maximum lifespan. The aim of OPTIFROP was to support strategic decision-making, such as ‘when to plant’, ‘what to plant’, ‘with which technology’, and ‘how much area of each activity’. Thus, the model allowed identification of the options for development plans for Patagonian farms (‘window of opportunities’). The model allowed quantifying the trade-off between conflicting objectives. The different methods developed in this thesis contribute significantly to the fruit industry in South Patagonia by supporting growers, extensionists and researchers in developing structured thinking for analyzing and processing available (fragmented) information...|$|E
40|$|De Wit {{replacement}} series {{were used}} to study competitive interactions between epiphytic Ice+Pseudomonas syringae strains and the biological <b>frost</b> <b>control</b> agents Ice-P. syringae TLP 2 del 1 and Pseudomonas fluorescens A 506. Mixtures containing two strains in different proportions but at a constant total population size were inoculated onto potato leaves. The population sizes of each strain and the total population size were determined when the community had reached equilibrium. A near-isogenic P. syringae strain pair exhibited an interaction similar to that expected for strains competing equally for limiting environmental resources. Replacement series with nonisogenic Ice+ and Ice-P. syringae strain pairs suggested that these strains competed for limiting resources according to their relative competitive abilities. There {{was no evidence of}} any niche differentiation between the Ice+P. syringae strains and the Ice-P. syringae strain. The growth responses of epiphytes following addition of nutrients to the phyllosphere indicated that the epiphytic P. syringae populations were nutrient limited and that, under growth chamber conditions, the populations were more limited by the availability of carbon than by the availability of nitrogen. Determination of in vitro carbon source utilization profiles provided further evidence for the lack of niche differentiation between the Ice+ and the Ice-P. syringae strains. Niche overlap indices calculated for the Ice+P. syringae strains with respect to Ice-P. syringae TLP 2 del 1 were uniformly high, indicating ecological similarity, and were consistent with the observed low level of coexistence.

40|$|Air-to-air heat {{exchangers}} {{can be used}} to preheat ventilating air and hence increase the winter ventilation rate in livestock barns; however, frost accumulation is a major problem in this application. Currently available <b>frost</b> <b>control</b> systems operate based on some combination of time, core pressure drop, or exhaust air temperature. These systems do not result in an optimal rate of heat transfer, independent of barn temperature and relative humidity. In this project, a <b>frost</b> <b>control</b> strategy based on the measured instantaneous rate of heat transfer was studied. The control strategy involved measuring the temperature rise of the cold air stream and controlling the rate of heat transfer by positioning a damper to regulate the mass flow rate of the cold air stream. As an aid to the design of the controller, a simulation model was developed. The model was based on an existing steady-state model of a condensing heat exchanger. The model was enhanced and changed in order that it could predict the thermal performance of a heat exchanger over time as frost formed in the heat exchanger. Experiments were conducted with a 472 L/s plate-type commercial heat exchanger. The experiments were used to calibrate the heat exchanger simulation, to validate the simulation model, and to test the proposed <b>frost</b> <b>control</b> strategy. The simulation model was useful in developing the control strategy and in establishing the control parameters for the prototype controller. Also, the simulation showed that {{it was not possible to}} continuously maintain a constant rate of heat transfer which approached the maximum possible heat transfer rate available from the heat exchanger. The simulation did show that a time average rate of heat transfer approach­ing the maximum passible heat transfer rate was possible. The cali­brated heat transfer model did satisfactorily predict the general trends of the controlled heat exchanger operation. However, there were enough differences between the experimental results and simulation results that significant redevelopments to the simulation heat and mass transfer model will be necessary to obtain good agreement. In the prototype tests, the prototype controller was confirmed to operate satisfactorily under four widely differing input conditions. Three control parameters were identified as being critical to the design of a heat transfer optimizing controller; the amount of heat transfer degradation permitted before a defrost is initiated, the maximum cold air stream mass flow rate through the heat exchanger permitted just following a defrost; and the rate at which the supply air flow rate is changed. The proposed control strategy directly measures the instantaneous rate of heat transfer. This enables the optimal average heat recovery to be obtained over a wide range of input conditions. Further develop­ment is necessary to establish the optimal control parameters and to complete development of a marketable heat exchanger frost controller...|$|E
40|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Professors Sanford Klein and Douglas Reindl; 165 pp. Implementation of energy conservation measures in buildings can extend our use of finite resources while simultaneously reducing our impact on the environment. This project summarizes efforts to identify economically-viable strategies to reduce HVAC related energy usage and improve the indoor air quality at a facility that houses primates and large cats. The primary focus of energy conservation strategies for the facility centered around air-to-air energy recovery concepts including enthalpy exchangers and runaround loops. Component and system models for transient computer simulations were developed for the existing facility and for several equipment alternatives including enthalpy exchangers and runaround loop heat exchangers. The model of the enthalpy exchanger {{is based on a}} new semi-empirical NTU Correction Factor Method. Given only two reference data points, the model is able to predict effectiveness for any balanced and unbalanced flow condition. The runaround loop is modeled as two counterflow liquid-to-air heat exchangers coupled by a heat transfer liquid. The model incorporates liquid flow rate and bypass control. Both models include various options of economizer control and <b>frost</b> <b>control,</b> as well as calculations of parasitic losses. Comparisons of <b>frost</b> <b>control</b> strategies for energy recovery systems were prepared and show that preheating of outdoor air is a favorable solution for enthalpy exchangers. The new simulation models are validated with experimental data. The building model is a detailed model including all internal gains, humidity and solar irradiation and is created in TRNSYS, a software package for transient simulations. The simulations were based on hourly weather data for one year. The simulations allow energy consumption and indoor air quality to be optimized. The findings of the simulations suggest that more than 80 % of the heating energy and 45 % of the cooling energy can be saved by implementation of air-to-air energy recovery and conservative control settings. The proposal for changes of the HVAC system includes specifications of energy recovery systems and an economic analysis.

The objectives of the field studies were to evaluate two methods of sprinkler irrigation for frost protection, the conventional approach consisting of continuous irrigation throughout the night (CON) and intermittent cycling of sprinklers (INT) incorporating cycling on and off throughout the night, by (i) assessing bud damage and yield for cranberry cultivars 2 ̆ 7 Early Black 2 ̆ 7, 2 ̆ 7 Howes 2 ̆ 7, and 2 ̆ 7 Stevens 2 ̆ 7 managed under both methods and (ii) to determine the volume of water used in each method. The objectives of the laboratory studies were to (i) evaluate and quantify carbohydrates and lipids synthesized by cranberry during the cold acclimation period under a controlled environment and to (ii) determine the cold hardiness (LT 50) and lowest survival temperature (LST) of buds of economically important cranberry cultivars during acclimation. For INT to be an effective <b>frost</b> <b>control</b> method, temperature set points should be cultivar specific. Despite differences in bud damage, cranberry yield data did not show any {{significant differences between the two}} frost management methods. Since cranberry plants produce more flowers than the number of set fruit that can be supported, the remaining flowers in damaged buds may have been sufficient to produce similar yields in both methods. Substantial water savings were obtained under INT, especially on mild frost nights. Greater concentrations of total non-structural carbohydrates (TNSC) and membrane stabilizing lipids and a higher fatty acid unsaturation index were associated with low acclimation temperatures. This result suggests the importance of these compounds in increasing cold hardiness in cranberry during acclimation. In addition, a progression of freezing tolerance, determined as the LT 50 and LST, was noted in the fall for all the cranberry cultivars. Knowledge of bud hardiness in the fall is important in considering the need to protect buds. Differences in hardiness should be considered when implementing frost protection in the fall...|$|E
40|$|Frost {{formation}} in heat/energy exchangers is undesirable {{because it may}} reduce air flow through the exchanger, increase the power consumption of fans, decrease {{the effectiveness of the}} exchanger, and in extreme cases, cause physical damage to the exchanger. Frosting is more critical in regions with arctic weather conditions, such as Canada and Northern Europe. Membrane-based energy exchangers are believed to be an important step towards frost free exchangers; however, {{at the beginning of this}} PhD study, there was no data available in the open literature documenting frosting in membrane energy exchangers. Therefore, the main goal of this PhD work is to determine if membrane energy exchangers are less susceptible to frosting than conventional heat exchangers. In this thesis, an in-depth study between conventional cross-flow air-to-air heat exchangers and membrane energy exchangers is conducted to (1) quantify the frosting limit; the operating conditions at which frost first begins in an exchanger, (2) develop a theoretical model to predict the frosting limit, and (3) quantify the energy impact of frosting and defrosting cycles on energy recovery. To meet these objectives, a test facility to test exchangers under frosting and defrosting cycles is developed and different strategies to detect frosting inside the exchangers are investigated. For the first time in the literature, it is shown that the temperature profile at the exhaust outlet can be used as a reliable and quick method to detect frosting. The frosting limit temperature of the energy exchanger is found to be 5 ℃ to 10 ℃ lower than the frosting limit of the heat exchanger under the same air flow rate and exhaust air relative humidity. Testing the exchangers under both frosting and defrosting conditions shows that the frost accumulation rate is nearly linear with time, while the frost removal rate decreases exponentially with time. Moreover, the frosting rate in the heat exchanger is found to be three times higher than that of the energy exchanger. A theoretical model to predict the frosting limit using the design parameters of the exchangers and the operating conditions is developed. The model is verified with experiments. Both the experimental and theoretical results show that the indoor air moisture content and the outdoor air temperature have significant effects on the frosting limit. Finally, a method to calculate the energy impact of frosting is introduced. Comparison between different <b>frost</b> <b>control</b> strategies in exchangers shows that frost prevention is preferred over repeated cycle of frosting followed by defrosting...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. According to the {{mechanism}} and influencing factors of subgrade frost heaving, subgrade with berms structure was proposed based on typical highway {{to prevent the}} frost heaving. The solid model of subgrade was established. Numerical calculation model of subgrade was established by applying the finite difference software FLAC 3 D, boundary conditions and parameters of numerical model were determined, models of subgrade with berms of different widths were analysed and calculated. The results show that subgrade with berms can effectively reduce the freezing depth of subgrade, and decrease the stress and deformation of subgrade frost heaving, berm that is 3 m wide in given simulation conditions has the most significant effects on preventing and <b>controlling</b> <b>frost</b> heaving...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{temperatures}} play a {{key role}} on the dynamics of geomorphological processes in periglacial environments. However, little is known about soil thermal dynamics in periglacial environments of semiarid mid-latitude mountains, where seasonal frost is dominant. From September 2006 to August 2012 we havemonitored soil temperatures at different depths (2, 10, 20, 50 and 100 cm) in a solifluction landformlocated at 3005 m. a. s. l. in the summit area of the Sierra Nevada (South Spain). Mean annual temperatures in the firstmeter of the soil ranged from 3. 6 to 3. 9 °Cwhile themean annual air temperature at the nearby Veleta peak was 0. 08 °C. Therefore, these data point out the inexistence of widespread permafrost conditions today in this massif. Seasonal <b>frost</b> <b>controls</b> the geomorphodynamics even in the highest lands. Climate conditions have shown a large interannual variability, as it is characteristic in a high mountainous Mediterranean environment. These variations are reflected in the patterns of soil thermal dynamics. The depth and duration of the frozen layer are strongly conditioned by the thickness of the snow cover. The date of the first significant snowfalls conditioned the beginning and rhythm of freezing of the soil. Wet years resulted in a thick snow cover which insulated the ground from external climate oscillations and favored a shallow frost layer (2008 – 2009, 2009 – 2010 and 2010 – 2011). On the other hand, years with low precipitations promoted deeper freezing of the soil down to 60 – 70 cm extending until late May or early June (2006 – 2007, 2007 – 2008 and 2011 – 2012). When snow melted a high increase of temperatures of 10 – 12 °C in few weeks was recorded at all depths. At this time of the year, periglacial activity is enhanced due to higher water availability and the existence of freeze–thaw cycles. These were recorded mostly in spring and autumn in the first 50 cm depth of the soil, ranging from 9. 8 days (at 2 cm) to 3. 7 days (at 50 cm). However, the inactivity of solifluction landforms suggests that the combination of present-day soil temperatures together with moisture conditions is not favorable to promote solifluction activity in the periglacial belt of the Sierra Nevada. Future climate scenarios point to a temperature increase and precipitation decrease in the area, which would entail deeper but shorter frozen soil layers. These conditions would not be favorable for active periglacial slope processes in the Sierra Nevada. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
