40|$|Abstract. <b>Intake</b> <b>manifold</b> is {{a crucial}} part in an engine {{that acts as a}} medium for air flow to mix with the fuel before {{entering}} the combustion chamber. For years, cast iron and aluminium were the primary materials chosen for fabrication of an <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> before plastic based material was introduced to the field. However, there is lack of research involving the usage of plastic as the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> material. In this paper, the effects of internal surface roughness variations (Cast iron, aluminium and plastic) inside the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> were studied. Three dimensional, <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> model was developed to simulate the airflow. The study emphasized on the airflow velocity inside the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold.</b> The study showed that the surface roughness influenced the air flow velocity near the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> outlet. The plastic based <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> exhibited the highest air stream velocity (near the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> outlet) at 477. 770 m/s. This value is 0. 60 % and 0. 40 % higher than those produced by the cast iron and aluminium <b>intake</b> <b>manifold,</b> respectively...|$|R

Suction pipe <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> {{is not too}} important, but design of <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> can influenced on homogeneity and air-fuel mixture flow rate from carburetor to combustion engine. Objectives of this research to get and compare performance of the engine motorcycle has used <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> standard and <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> racing on Yamaha Jupiter Z 2005. Object has used is Yamaha Jupiter Z 2005 four-stroke motorcycle using carburetor Mikuni 26 mm. The testing has doing for every <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> to get torque, power and specific fuel consumption at 4000 - 9000 rpm. It use dynotest V 3. 3 Rextor Pro Dyno Inertia dynamometer in Mototech Laboratorium Yogyakarta. The result shows that <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> racing on standard piston can produce higher power and torque than <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> standard at low rpm and next rpm has happened changing along with the fuel consumption increased until stop the supply of air-fuel mixture because of limited supply of fuel from carburetor. In 4000 rpm, <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> racing on standard piston the fuel used is lower than standard <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> standard...|$|R
25|$|Wankel engines run {{very hot}} on the {{ignition}} and exhaust side of the engine's trochoid chamber, whereas the intake and compression parts are cooler. Suzuki opted for a complicated oil-cooling and water cooling system, with Garside reasoning that provided the power did not exceed , air-cooling would suffice. Garside cooled {{the interior of the}} rotors with filtered ram-air. This very hot air was cooled in a plenum contained within the semi-monocoque frame and afterwards, once mixed with fuel, fed into the engine. This air was quite oily after running through the interior of the rotors, and thus was used to lubricate the rotor tips. The exhaust pipes become very hot, with Suzuki opting for a finned exhaust manifold, twin-skinned exhausted pipes with cooling grilles, heatproof pipe wrappings and silencers with heat shields. Garside simply tucked the pipes out of harm's way under the engine, where heat would dissipate in the breeze of the vehicle's forward motion. Suzuki opted for complicated multi-stage carburation, whilst Garside choose simple carburetors. Suzuki had three lube systems, whilst Garside had a single total-loss oil injection system which was fed to both the main bearings and the <b>intake</b> <b>manifolds.</b> Suzuki chose a single rotor that was fairly smooth, however with rough patches at 4,000rpm; Garside opted for a turbine-smooth twin-rotor motor. Suzuki mounted the massive rotor high in the frame, but Garside put his rotors as low as possible to lower the center of gravity of the motorcycle.|$|E

2500|$|The Valiant debuted an all-new 6-cylinder overhead-valve engine, {{the famous}} Slant-6. Its inline {{cylinders}} were uniquely canted 30° {{to the right}} (passenger side). This allowed a lower hoodline, shorter engine length—the water pump was shifted from front to alongside—and efficient long-branch individual-runner <b>intake</b> <b>manifolds,</b> an advance that benefited from Chrysler's pioneering work in tuned intakes.

30|$|In this paper, the 3 D {{model of}} the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> is reconstructed using the inverse method and CATIA software. The {{applicability}} and authenticity of the model is ensured due to the actual shape of the engine <b>intake</b> <b>manifold.</b> The internal flow field of the manifold is analyzed by combining CAD, CATIA, and CFD software with FLUENT; in addition, the equation is established on the air flow in the manifold and used in the SIMPLE algorithm. The calculation speed is accelerated through combining GAMBIT and FLUENT software, dividing the internal flow field of the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold,</b> and setting the boundary conditions. The {{results show that the}} optimized flow field is reasonable, the air flow is higher, and the pressure is reduced to varying degrees in the manifold, which effectively reduces the intake resistance and helps to increase the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold,</b> especially in the main optimization position by comparing the internal flow field of the engine <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> and the optimized <b>intake</b> <b>manifold.</b>|$|R
30|$|Due to {{the complex}} {{structure}} of the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold,</b> it can be modified and optimized according to the experience, {{and the performance of}} the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> is only evaluated through the steady flow test in the automobile design.
