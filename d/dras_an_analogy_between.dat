40|$|Analogies {{are often}} {{theoretically}} useful. Important principles of electricity are suggested by <b>an</b> <b>analogy</b> <b>between</b> water flowing through a pipe and electricity “flowing” through a wire, with voltage corresponding to pressure, amperage {{corresponding to the}} current, and so on. A basic theory of sound is suggested by <b>an</b> <b>analogy</b> <b>between</b> waves caused by a stone being dropped into a still lake and “sound waves ” caused by a disturbance in air. Of course, principles suggested by such analogies need to be confirmed by relevant evidence. Even where analogies are fruitful, they are only partial. Sound waves and electricity are not wet; electricity does not spill out when a wire is cut. One important function of <b>an</b> <b>analogy</b> <b>between</b> one subject and another is to suggest topics or questions {{to be considered in}} the other subject.

By using Quantum Theory, it is possible to model more precisely contextual in-formation in a seamless and principled fashion within the Logical Imaging process. While further work is needed to empirically validate this, the foundations for doing so are provided. ...|$|R
