In addition, <b>gradable</b> adjectives (GAs) subdivide into two classes: relative and maximal GA’s.|$|E

50|$|The term antonym (and {{the related}} antonymy) is {{commonly}} {{taken to be}} synonymous with opposite, but antonym also has other more restricted meanings. Graded (or <b>gradable)</b> antonyms are word pairs whose meanings are opposite and which lie on a continuous spectrum (hot, cold). Complementary antonyms are word pairs whose meanings are opposite but whose meanings do not lie on a continuous spectrum (push, pull). Relational antonyms are word pairs where opposite makes sense only {{in the context of}} the relationship between the two meanings (teacher, pupil). These more restricted meanings may not apply in all scholarly contexts, with Lyons (1968, 1977) defining antonym to mean <b>gradable</b> antonyms, and Crystal (2003) warns that antonymy and antonym should be regarded with care.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of adjectives {{are of the}} first kind. These express any qualities and properties of personal and impersonal nouns. Such adjectives are <b>gradable</b> either in the two- or three-step comparison, depending if they are relative to another, opposite adjective (three-step) or not (two-step or three-step). (lep - grd (beautiful - ugly) vs bolan (ill)).|$|E
50|$|Technically, intensifiers roughly qualify a {{point on}} the affective {{semantic}} property, which is <b>gradable.</b> Syntactically, intensifiers pre-modify either adjectives or adverbs. Semantically, they increase the emotional content of an expression. The basic intensifier is very. A versatile word, English permits very to modify adjectives and adverbs, but not verbs. Other intensifiers often express the same intention as very.|$|E
5000|$|When {{it comes}} to {{acquiring}} the meanings of adjectives, Syrett and Lidz (2010) found that children also rely on the syntactic frames in which the adjectives are presented. The authors tested how the type of meaning children would assign to a novel <b>gradable</b> adjective (GA). <b>Gradable</b> adjectives modify nouns by putting them on a scale with other nouns. Some examples include big, dry, full, and tall. There are furthermore two subclasses of GAs. Maximal GAs operate on a scale with an upper bound: these include adjectives like full. Relative GAs do not, and are only interpreted {{with respect to a}} particular reference point: for example, a big ant is only [...] "big" [...] with respect to other ants. These adjectives can occur with different types of adverbs: relative GAs can occur with intensifiers like very, but not with adverbs like completely. However, maximal GAs can be modified by completely: ...|$|E
5000|$|Adjectives {{can also}} be used predicatively. In this case they behave more like verbs; {{there is no need for}} a copular verb in {{sentences}} like [...] "he is happy" [...] in Chinese; one may say simply 他高兴 他高興 tā gāoxìng, literally [...] "he happy", where the adjective may be interpreted as a verb meaning [...] "is happy". In such sentences it is common for the adjective to be modified by a word meaning [...] "very" [...] or the like; in fact the word 很 hěn ("very") is often used in such cases (with <b>gradable</b> adjectives) even without carrying the meaning of [...] "very".|$|E
50|$|An antonym {{is one of}} a pair {{of words}} with {{opposite}} meanings. Each word in the pair is the antithesis of the other. A word may have more than one antonym. There are three categories of antonyms identified {{by the nature of the}} relationship between the opposed meanings. Where the two words have definitions that lie on a continuous spectrum of meaning, they are <b>gradable</b> antonyms. Where the meanings do not lie on a continuous spectrum and the words have no other lexical relationship, they are complementary antonyms. Where the two meanings are opposite only within the context of their relationship, they are relational antonyms.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} Hearts and Arrows were diamonds that {{surfaced in}} the mid 1980s in Japan that embodied three important design factors. The first of these factors {{was that they were}} cut to what is known in the diamond industry as [...] "ideal proportions," [...] i.e. very close to those summarized by Marcel Tolkowsky in his 1919 book, Diamond Design. Second, they were cut with very good physical and optical symmetry so that they would garner the grade of [...] "Excellent" [...] in the system used by Japanese laboratories. The third important factor was that they were cut to a very specific brilliantine scheme to produce the accepted hearts and arrows pattern. This faceting scheme involves prescribed lengths and ratios as well as smaller table sizes that are imperative in producing a distinctive, repeatable and <b>gradable</b> hearts and arrows pattern.|$|E
40|$|In Mandarin Chinese, <b>gradable</b> {{adjectives}} map {{the properties}} of the arguments into abstract representations. The intensifiers can modify <b>gradable</b> adjectives. Hen, an intensifier, is widely used in Mandarin Chinese. There are plenty of the <b>gradable</b> adjectives, {{but it is difficult to}} build a distinctive standard. Mandarin Chinese lacks the standard methods to evaluate whether an adjective is a <b>gradable</b> adjective. This thesis introduces two tests for the distinctive standard, including the hen test and the comparison test. The hen test is to test whether hen can modify an adjective. The comparison test is to test whether an adjective can be used in a comparative form. If one adjective has at least one hit in one test, it means that the evaluated adjective can pass this test. This thesis argues that all <b>gradable</b> adjectives have to pass the two tests. The center for Chinese linguistics corpus CCL (2016) is used to identify the <b>gradable</b> adjectives in Mandarin Chinese. If an adjective has at least one hit in the query result of each test, the corresponding adjective can be treated as a <b>gradable</b> adjective. The analysis of the <b>gradable</b> adjectives is controversial in Mandarin. The problem is data evidence of the <b>gradable</b> adjectives. Most of the previous analyses argued that the bare <b>gradable</b> adjectives as main predicates are not allowed. It is indeed allowed in Mandarin in the data collection, when the argument is known to the speaker and the listener. Those analyses had been built based on the ungrammatical bare <b>gradable</b> adjectives. In order to build an analysis for the <b>gradable</b> adjectives and hen, this thesis proposes two puzzles. The two puzzles include the puzzle of the bare <b>gradable</b> adjectives as main predicates and the reading puzzle. This thesis finds that the bare <b>gradable</b> adjectives as main predicates exist in Mandarin Chinese. They are allowed in Mandarin when the argument is specific. The reading puzzle is that the bare <b>gradable</b> adjectives are the positive reading or the comparative reading. The reading of the <b>gradable</b> adjectives is controversial, because the <b>gradable</b> adjectives can express the same meaning with the positive form or the explicit comparative form. The reading of the <b>gradable</b> adjectives is positive if there is no explicit comparison. The comparative reading should have an explicit comparative morphology or an explicit comparative context. This thesis proposes that <b>gradable</b> adjectives as main predicate require specific arguments in Mandarin Chinese. If the argument is unspecific, the bare <b>gradable</b> adjective as main predicate will be ungrammatical. A degree phrase, DegP, is used to build an analysis for the <b>gradable</b> adjectives and hen, where the bare <b>gradable</b> adjectives have covert degree morphology. Based on the specific argument and DegP, this thesis has built an analysis for hen and the <b>gradable</b> adjectives in Mandarin. This analysis manages to address the sentences with bare <b>gradable</b> adjectives and the sentences with hen and <b>gradable</b> adjectives. In combination with the movement, this analysis is able to address the sentence where de as a complement marker is preceded by a <b>gradable</b> adjective and is followed by hen...|$|E

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the phenomenon of}} grading non-gradable adjectives from semantic and historical perspectives by examining the history of unique. The apparent clash that arises between unique 2 ̆ 7 s generally accepted definition of 2 ̆ 2 {{one of a kind}} 2 ̆ 2 and its actual usage with adverbs like somewhat and very is polysemy in which unique has two definitions - the non-gradable 2 ̆ 2 one of a kind 2 ̆ 2 and the <b>gradable</b> 2 ̆ 2 uncommon. 2 ̆ 2 Using three corpora of American English for a total of almost one billion words spanning two centuries, I found that grading unique has become less frequent over the past hundred years. Contrary to prescriptivist assumptions, the non-gradable sense of unique is gaining popularity, not losing it. Grading patterns compared among six additional adjectives - three <b>gradable</b> and three non-gradable - revealed that grading adverbs collocate more with <b>gradable</b> adjectives than with non-gradable ones, while epistemic adverbs collocate more with non-gradable adjectives than with <b>gradable</b> ones. Gradability was also shown to be <b>gradable,</b> i. e., some adjectives are more <b>gradable</b> than others, and each adjective has its own story...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper {{investigates the}} way that lexical {{semantic}} properties of linguistic expressions influence vagueness, focusing on {{the interpretation of the}} positive (unmarked) form of <b>gradable</b> adjectives. I begin by developing a semantic analysis of the positive form of ‘relative ’ <b>gradable</b> adjectives, expanding on previous proposals by further motivating a semantic basis for vagueness and by precisely identifying and characterizing the division of labor between the compositional and contextual aspects of its interpretation. I then introduce a challenge to the analysis from the class of ‘absolute ’ <b>gradable</b> adjectives: adjectives that are demonstrably <b>gradable,</b> but which have positive forms that relate objects to maximal or minimal degrees, and do not give rise to vagueness. I argue that the truth conditional difference between relative and absolute adjectives in the positive form stems from the interaction of lexical semantic properties of <b>gradable</b> adjectives—the structure of the scales they use—and a general constraint on interpretive economy that requires truth conditions to be computed o...|$|E
40|$|A central {{question}} within {{the study of}} gradability in natural language is whether different grammatical categories – adjectives, verbs, and nouns – are <b>gradable</b> in the same way. One means of addressing this question is by examining wide-distribution modifiers that combine with <b>gradable</b> predicates {{of all of these}} categories. This thesis examines one such modifier: 'baie' "very/a lot" in Afrikaans. At first glance, 'baie' appears to have a maximally wide distribution, as it can modify <b>gradable</b> predicates of all categories. However, it is shown that 'baie' is in fact polysemous: two distinct instances of the modifier can be distinguished on the basis of semantic and syntactic tests. One modifies <b>gradable</b> adjectives, and the other modifies the remaining <b>gradable</b> categories. Semantic and syntactic analyses of these two instances of 'baie' are provided. Additionally, competition between 'baie' and the Afrikaans modifier 'veel' "a lot" in excessive and equative constructions is explained {{on the basis of the}} inherent evaluativity of the relevant instance of 'baie'. The thesis also speculates as to how these two distinct versions of 'baie' may have developed. The thesis’ key contribution is its questioning of whether modifiers with a maximally-wide distribution really exist, or whether other modifiers that, like 'baie', have previously been analysed as single items might in fact be polysemous; and portion out the modification of different grammatical categories between apparently identical but semantically and syntactically distinct items. The analysis presented here also makes fruitful use of a distinction between the gradability of <b>gradable</b> adjectives and <b>gradable</b> verbs, which are modified in terms of quality/intensity, and the gradability of other <b>gradable</b> categories, which are modified in terms of quantity/frequency. Finally, this study is also the first, to my knowledge, to focus on degree modification in Afrikaans...|$|E

In contrast, this paper suggests that the attested contextual variability {{is a consequence of}} a more general tendency to use <b>gradable</b> terms to preferentially pick out extreme-valued properties. This tendency, in turn, can be explained by demonstrating that it is pragmatically beneficial to use those <b>gradable</b> properties in referential descriptions that are perceptually salient in a given context...|$|E

40|$|Focusing on the {{examples}} of multiple degree modification, this paper argues that the class of degree expressions in English is syntactically and semantically diverse, subdivided both according to the semantic effects of its members {{and according to the}} extent to which they permit, and participate in, multiple layers of modification. We argue that these two factors are linked, and result in (at least) a three-way distinction between TRUE DEGREE MORPHEMES, which map <b>gradable</b> adjectives to properties of individuals and combine with their arguments in a Head-Specifier structure; INTENSIFIERS, which are syntactic and semantic modifiers of properties constructed out of <b>gradable</b> adjectives; and SCALE MODIFIERS, which are also syntactic and semantic modifiers, but which combine with ‘bare ’ <b>gradable</b> adjectives (relations between individuals and degrees) rather than properties formed out of <b>gradable</b> adjectives. ...|$|E
40|$|It is a {{well-known}} but little-studied fact that evaluative adverbs - adverbs indicating {{the attitude of the}} speaker towards the information she is conveying - can modify degree ('incredibly tall', 'ridiculously expensive' [...] .). This thesis offers a syntactosemantic account of evaluative degree modi fication of both <b>gradable</b> adjectives and <b>gradable</b> nouns. Following Morzycki (2004), I propose that evaluative degree modi fication involves a covert operator (which I will call EVAL); however, my proposal differs from that of Morzycki in several crucial respects. Most importantly, I argue that evaluative degree constructions should not be analysed as embedded exclamatives. Furthermore, I show how their syntactic behaviour illuminates their semantic composition, using evidence from different phenomena in both English and Dutch. Subsequently, I examine the linguistic evidence for the gradability of certain nouns, like 'idiot', 'nerd', 'genius', 'Barbie doll enthusiast', and 'weirdo', and conclude that they, like <b>gradable</b> adjectives, have a degree argument. I show how this class of <b>gradable</b> nouns may be defined in prototype-theoretic terms. Morzycki (2009) has shown that <b>gradable</b> nouns can be modified by size adjectives like 'big' and 'enormous'; I extend his account by including degree modification by evaluative adjectives. Finally, several suggestions for further research are offered...|$|E
40|$|Different {{languages}} employ differing syntactic {{means to}} express comparison, i. e. to assert a ranking of two entities along a scale.

40|$|The {{relational}} {{analysis of}} <b>gradable</b> predicates and degree constructions posits that all <b>gradable</b> predicates are of type and that degree morphology introduces the ordering between topic and standard of comparison. While well supported by data from many languages, the relational analysis {{is shown in}} this thesis not to adequately account for data from Navajo. Drawing on extensive data from Navajo <b>gradable</b> predicates and degree constructions, it is shown that alternation in degree morphology determines the semantic type of <b>gradable</b> predicates (vs.) while standard markers introduce the ordering relation. The syntax and semantics of degree constructions using both types of predicates are considered in detail. The most tenable analysis of the Navajo data builds on a recent proposal by Kennedy (2007 a) in which standard markers introduce the semantics of the degree construction while degree morphology has a greatly reduced role, serving only to determine the type of the predicate. Not only does this analysis account for the Navajo data but it also accounts for 'problematic' aspects of degree constructions in other languages...|$|E
30|$|<b>Gradable</b> {{adjectives}} are {{the ones}} whose values typically strongly depend on the noun they modify: cf. {{the value of the}} lexeme big in the phrases a big star and a big virus, respectively. The degree of gradability of a given adjective can be defined quantitatively (operationalized) as the ratio of the number of occurrences of a given adjective in some corpus in comparative and superlative forms to all its occurrences in that corpus (cf. Wulf 2003). The first two semantic categories mentioned above, these of “opinion” and “size” seem to be the most <b>gradable</b> ones, while the categories of “origin” and “material” intuitively seem to be the least <b>gradable.</b> Consider for instance the phrases, a big child, and an American girl.|$|E

Two items in the analysis can either be subjective (agent-based), or objective (world-based) : the ordering of elements along the scale projected by the adjective, and {{the setting of the}} standard of comparison. Dimensional relative <b>gradable</b> adjectives imply a world-based ordering and an agent-based setting of the standard; dimensional relative <b>gradable</b> adjectives imply an agent based ordering as well as an agent-based setting of the standard.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{the success rate}} of the initial fundus photography session in producing <b>gradable</b> images for screening diabetic retinopathy in children < 18 years of age with type 1 diabetes (T 1 D), and to analyze outcome-associated factors. DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study. METHODS: Mydriatic red-free monochromatic 60 degree digital fundus images centered on the macula and optic disc of 213 patients were graded. Photography success was classified as "complete" if both images of both eyes were <b>gradable,</b> "partial" if both images of 1 eye were <b>gradable,</b> "macula-centered image(s) only" if only the macula-centered image of one or both eyes was grad able, and "unsuccessful" if neither macula-centered image was <b>gradable.</b> RESULTS: Complete success was reached in 97 (46 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 39 - 52) patients, at least partial success in 153 (72 %; 95 % CI, 65 - 78) patients, success of macula-centered image(s) only in 47 (22 %; 95 % CI, 17 - 28) patients, and in 13 (6 %; 95 %CI, 3 - 10) patients fundus photography was unsuccessful. Macula centered images were more often <b>gradable</b> in both eyes than optic disc-centered images (P <. 001). Success, of photography did not differ between right and left eye. Sex, age at diagnosis of T 1 D, and the duration of diabetes, age, and glycemic control {{at the time of}} initial photography were unassociated with complete success. Partial success tended to decrease with increasing age category (P =. 093), and the frequency of <b>gradable</b> macula-centered image(s) only increased with increasing age (P =. 043). CONCLUSIONS: Less than half of the children achieved complete success, but in only 6 % initial fundus photography was unsuccessful, indicating its value in assessing retinopathy in the pediatric setting.

40|$|The {{standard}} degree {{analysis of}} gradability in English {{holds that the}} function of degree morphology, such as the comparative, measure phrases, and degree adverbs, is to bind a degree variable located in the lexical semantics of <b>gradable</b> predicates. In this paper, I investigate gradation structures in Washo (isolate/Hokan), and claim that this language systematically lacks degree morphology of this sort. I propose that this gap in the functional inventory of Washo stems from a parameter on whether languages are able to introduce degree variables into the logical form that can be bound by such operators, providing further cross-linguistic support for a similar proposal made by Beck et al. (2009) for Motu (Austronesian). Specifically, I argue that <b>gradable</b> predicates in Washo do not introduce a degree variable. Consequently, {{if we assume that}} <b>gradable</b> predicates in English are type ⟨d, ⟨e, t⟩⟩, then Washo and English must differ in their lexical semantics for <b>gradable</b> predicates. Alternatively, if we want to maintain lexical uniformity between the two languages (i. e., that <b>gradable</b> predicates in English don’t themselves introduce degrees), then we must place variation at the level of a grammatical mechanism that introduces degrees in English for degree operators to bind, but which is lacking in Washo. The results of this investigation thus inform questions about the nature of cross-linguistic variation, specifically the division of labor between variation in functional categories and the lexicon.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop a {{semantic}} typology of <b>gradable</b> predicates, with {{special emphasis on}} deverbal adjectives. We argue for the linguistic relevance of this typol-ogy by demonstrating that the distribution and interpretation of degree modiers is sensitive to its two major classicatory parameters: (1) whether a <b>gradable</b> predicate is associated with what we call an OPEN or CLOSED scale and (2) whether the stan-dard of comparison for {{the applicability of the}} predicate is ABSOLUTE or RELATIVE to a context. We further show that the classication of an important subclass of ad-jectives within the typology is largely predictable. Specically, the scale structure of a deverbal <b>gradable</b> adjective correlates either with the algebraic part structure of the event denoted by its source verb or with the part structure of the entities to which the adjective applies. These correlations underscore the fact that gradability is character-istic not only of adjectives but also of verbs and nouns, and that scalar properties are shared by categorially distinct but derivationally-related expressions. 1.

40|$|The {{debate over}} epistemic contextualism has {{recently}} {{raised the question}} whether propositional knowledge attributions were <b>gradable</b> predicates. Contrary to Stanley (2005), I argue that they exhibit genuine constructions of degree. However, these constructions are limited in several important ways; most importantly, they only include what I call “qualitative modifications ” (well / better than) as opposed to “quantitative modifications ” (much / a lot / more). Drawing {{on the work of}} Kennedy and McNally (2005), I argue that the absence of quantitative modifications shows that know itself is not <b>gradable,</b> but that know well is. An interpretation of these constructions is put forward, according to which know well operates on degrees of epistemic justification which is not at the same time degrees of knowledge. I explore an extension of the account into a unified semantics for the various <b>gradable</b> constructions that occur with know, and indicate its distinctive predictions. I conclude by listing several unsolved issues. The putative gradability of propositional knowledge ascriptions has recently been the subject of a debate among philosophers.

40|$|Since {{containing}} a <b>gradable</b> adjective, the X A-le D construction not only implies {{a comparison between}} the standard value of comparison and the degree value derived by mapping the adjective’s argument into the scale associated with the adjective, but also idiosyncratically requires this comparing event to be completed. The realization aspect marker –le, which provides a default standard value of comparison for the comparing event, cooperates with the differential pseudo-object to guarantee completeness of the comparing event implied by the X A-le D construction. Our proposal on the X A-le D construction provides further support for Liu’s (2005) study on how Chinese constructs a sentence {{containing a}}n adjectival predicate; namely, a grammatical mechanism is {{needed to make the}} comparing event implied by a <b>gradable</b> adjective possible.

40|$|Contextualism in {{epistemology}} is {{the claim}} that the knowledge predicate is contextsensitive {{in the sense that it}} has different truth conditions across different contexts of use. Jason Stanley objects against this view that if it were correct! then "know" should be <b>gradable</b> in the same way as <b>gradable</b> adjectives. Since it lacks gradability it also lacks the postulated contextsensitivity. Or so Stanley argues. In this paper I show that the contextualist is not committed to the gradability of the knowledge predicate in the first place. I will distinguish between what I will call pure threshold predicates, which either apply simpliciter or not at all in each context, and impure threshold predicates, for which context determines whether they apply simpliciter, but which can also be satisfied to certain degrees. Threshold predicates are not <b>gradable,</b> but many of exhibit just the kind of contextsensitivity that is postulated for "know". Pace Stanley, three claims are going to be established: that the lack of gradability of the knowledge predicate (i) does not jeopardize its contextsensitivity, (ii) does not dismantle the analogies contextualists have claimed to hold between "know" and <b>gradable</b> adjectives, and (iii) is perfectly consistent with the idea of varyingly high epistemic standards...|$|E
