25|$|Is he <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> it away? Is {{he going}} to beat him with it? Or even kill him with it? Beckett’s plays often have a certain open-endedness and this sketch is no different. Perhaps because it has taken so little time to build up to this climax it lacks the {{resonance}} of Endgame’s concluding scene where we never know if Clov ever leaves Hamm or the close of Happy Days where the audience is left wondering if Willie is reaching for the gun or for Winnie.|$|E
25|$|The end {{of history}} is, alas, also {{the end of the}} dustbins of history. There are no longer any dustbins for {{disposing}} of old ideologies, old regimes, old values. Where are we <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> Marxism, which actually invented the dustbins of history? (Yet there is some justice here since the very people who invented them have fallen in.) Conclusion: if there are no more dustbins of history, this is because History itself has become a dustbin. It has become its own dustbin, just as the planet itself is becoming its own dustbin.|$|E
25|$|During Robinson's spring {{training}} with the Dodgers, {{he had been}} hit repeatedly by white pitchers when he stepped to the plate. Many expected the same to occur in Jersey City. But Sandel had played against Robinson, also a Californian, in baseball games {{on the west coast}} and harbored no ill feelings toward him. After the first several pitches were thrown and the count ran to 2-1, Dick Bouknight, the Giants catcher, walked to the mound and demanded to know if Sandell was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> at Robinson. Sandel refused. After running up a 3-2 count, Robinson ground out harmlessly to the shortstop.|$|E

25|$|The {{day after}} his funeral, his village was raided by New Zealand {{military}} police; they ransacked houses, {{including those of the}} Tamasese's mourning widow and children. Colonel Allen requested reinforcements from New Zealand after he claimed 2000 Mau had caused a riot. On 12 January 1930 the Royal New Zealand Navy flagship Dunedin brought marines to hunt down members of The Mau. The Mau, who were fully committed to Passive Resistance, easily slipped through the jungle; the marines were slow because they were carrying too much weaponry and didn't know the bush like The Mau. The Mau no longer trusted New Zealand police, and this fear only got worse after a 16-year-old un-armed Samoan was shot and killed while running away from a marine, whose excuse he thought the boy was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> a stone was accepted as an adequate defence and no charges were laid.|$|E
500|$|About Maryland, Nevada {{head coach}} Chris Ault said, [...] "Their offense {{to me is}} very balanced. They can run the ball and do a good job. With [...] Turner, they split out and they have some nice receivers. Whereas Missouri was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> {{it as much as}} Texas Tech did, I think Maryland is {{probably}} one of the more balanced teams we've played this year." ...|$|E
500|$|Feller again led {{the majors}} in wins (25), strikeouts (260), innings pitched (343), and walks (194) for the 1941 season. His six shutouts were an AL-best on the season. That year, Joe DiMaggio talked about Feller's {{pitching}} ability, stating [...] "I don't think anyone is ever <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> a ball faster than he does. And his curveball isn't human." [...] Feller {{appeared in the}} May 12, 1941, edition of Life, which said: [...] "...he is unquestionably the idol of several generations of Americans, {{ranging in age from}} 7 to 70. They represent of city, town, and village in the land, speak of him familiarly as 'Bob', and talk about him by the hour, with enthusiasm." ...|$|E

LeMond made a good move and a good sprint...Boyer was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> win that race. The best he could have got was fifth or sixth place." ...|$|R
500|$|Killebrew {{was known}} for his quick hands and {{exceptional}} upper-body strength, demonstrated by several [...] "tape measure" [...] home runs that he hit in the prime of his career. Killebrew said that his first home run in the Majors was his favorite, coming off Billy Hoeft at Griffith Stadium. He said of it, [...] "Frank House was the catcher. When I came to the plate, he said, 'Kid, we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> you a fastball.' I didn't know whether to believe him or not. I hit it out. It was one of the longest home runs I ever hit. As I crossed the plate, House said, 'That's the last time I ever tell you what pitch is coming'." ...|$|E
500|$|Edson {{received}} {{a message from}} the Raider Battalion reporting their failure to cross the Matanikau. [...] Edson, speaking to those around him, stated, [...] "I guess we better call them off. They can't seem to cross the river." [...] Puller angrily replied, [...] "You're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> these men away!" [...] apparently in reference to his men trapped {{on the west side of}} the Matanikau, and [...] "stormed" [...] off toward the beach where, with the help of his personal signalman, Puller was able to hail the Navy destroyer [...] that was supporting the operation. Once aboard Monssen, Puller and the destroyer led 10 landing craft towards Point Cruz and established communications with Kelley on the ridge by signal flag.|$|E
500|$|On the album's {{recording}} sessions, Smith noted [...] "there {{was a lot}} {{of drugs}} involved". The band took LSD and drank a lot of alcohol, and to save money, they slept in the office of their record label. The musicians usually turned up at eight, and left at midday looking [...] "fairly deranged". Smith related: [...] "We had an arrangement with the off-licence up the road, every night they would bring in supplies. We decided we weren't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> anything out. We built this mountain of empties in the corner, a gigantic pile of debris in the corner. It just grew and grew". According to Tolhurst, [...] "we wanted to make the ultimate, intense album. I can't remember exactly why, but we did". The recording sessions commenced and concluded in three weeks. Smith noted, [...] "At the time, I lost every friend I had, everyone, without exception, because I was incredibly obnoxious, appalling, self-centered". He also noted that with the album, he [...] "channelled all the self-destructive elements of my personality into doing something".|$|E
60|$|But in the meantime, {{towards the}} end of 1493, King Ferrante's uneasiness at the ever-swelling rumours of the {{impending}} French invasion was quickened {{by the fact that the}} Pope had not yet sent his son Giuffredo to Naples to marry Donna Sancia, as had been contracted. Ferrante feared the intrigues of Milan with Alexander, and that the latter might be induced, after all, to join the northern league. In a frenzy of apprehension, the old king was at last on the point of <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Milan <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> himself at the feet of Lodovico Sforza, who was now his only hope, when news reached him that his ambassadors had been ordered to leave France.|$|R
60|$|He {{rose from}} the sofa--the {{atmosphere}} of the place stifled him, and <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the window <b>threw</b> it open and stepped out on to the balcony. It was a lovely moonlight night, though chilly, and for London the street was a quiet one.|$|R
5000|$|Interscope was a {{young enough}} company where they were saying, [...] "We have only 12 artists, and it's not like we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>throwing</b> out 15 a month and see what sticks.

As time passed, the record came out, they signed more and more people, and all of a sudden, the idea of me doing a record every year or every 18 months turned into, [...] "Well, there's no commercial radio hit here anymore, you need to do a commercial radio kind of thing." ...|$|R
500|$|On September 4, 1995, Simms' jersey was {{retired in}} a halftime {{ceremony}} {{of a game}} versus the Dallas Cowboys. During an emotional speech, Simms stated {{that he wanted to}} don his jersey one final time, and throw [...] "one more pass" [...] to teammate Lawrence Taylor. Simms later commented, [...] "ll of a sudden it kind of hit me, I've put Lawrence in a really tough spot; national TV, he's got dress shoes and a sports jacket on, and he's had a few beers and he's going to run down the field and I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> him a pass." [...] Simms then motioned for Taylor to run a longer pattern, and after 30–40yards, threw him the pass. Taylor later stated that the situation made him more nervous than any play of his career, [...] "I'm saying to myself (as the pass is being thrown), 'If I drop this pass, I got to run my black ass all the way to Upper Saddle River because there ain't no way I'm {{going to be able to}} stay in that stadium'." [...] Taylor caught the pass however, and the capacity crowd in attendance cheered in approval. Since he has been retired for more than five years, Simms is eligible for selection into the Pro Football Hall of Fame; he has yet to be inducted, however.|$|E
500|$|After {{his career}} ended, Taylor worked in several regular {{television}} jobs. He first {{worked as a}} football analyst for the now defunct TNT Sunday Night Football. In a one-off show, Taylor also appeared as a wrestler in the World Wrestling Federation, defeating Bam Bam Bigelow in the main event of WrestleMania XI. He also worked as a color commentator on an amateur fighting program entitled Toughman on the FX channel. On September 4, 1995, the Giants retired Phil Simms' jersey during halftime of {{a game against the}} Cowboys (Taylor had his number retired the year before). Simms celebrated the moment by throwing an impromptu ceremonial pass to Taylor. Simms recalled, [...] "ll of a sudden it kind of hit me, I've put Lawrence in a really tough spot; national TV, he's got dress shoes and a sports jacket on, and he's had a few beers and he's going to run down the field and I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> him a pass."

500|$|Less than 24 {{hours after}} the pay-per-view, WWE {{announced}} on their official website that Vince McMahon had sent Heyman home, citing [...] "slumping television ratings and a disgruntled talent roster as causes for Mr. Heyman's dismissal". Heyman and McMahon clashed on the plane to the North Charleston Coliseum and after a producers' meeting, Heyman was escorted from the Coliseum and sent home. He was also immediately pulled from ECW's creative team after the altercation. McMahon was attempting to put the blame on Heyman for the poorly received pay-per-view, and after a meeting with Vince and Stephanie McMahon, Heyman legitimately left World Wrestling Entertainment but remained under contract. Heyman was against the decision of Lashley being booked to win the ECW Championship, and instead wanted to have CM Punk win it, a decision McMahon disliked. This situation was cited by Punk in his controversial shoot promo in 2011, in which {{he referred to the}} idea as one in which [...] "Heyman saw something in [...] that nobody else wanted to admit." [...] In an early 2008 interview with The Sun, Heyman gave more details on how he would have booked the Extreme Elimination Chamber main-event, which included having Punk enter first and quickly eliminating Big Show via submission. According to the interview, McMahon nixed the idea, but Big Show liked the direction Heyman was heading, and was eager for the opportunity to [...] "make" [...] a rising star like Punk. He also stated that he kept going to McMahon {{on the night of the}} pay-per-view to say that [...] "The people are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> this back in our face". Upset at how the event turned out, Tommy Dreamer and Stevie Richards both asked after the event to be released from their contracts. Both requests were refused by McMahon and WWE's Vice President of Talent Relations John Laurinaitis.|$|E
60|$|It was General Prideaux's plan to land some {{distance}} from Fort Niagara, and then lay siege to the place. The soldiers disembarked as silently as possible, the trees, rocks and bushes keeping them well hidden {{from those in the}} fort.

50|$|Langley began venturing out of {{the house}} only after midnight and would walk miles all over the city to get food, {{sometimes}} going as far as Williamsburg, Brooklyn to buy as little as a loaf of bread. He would also pick food {{out of the}} garbage and collect food that was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>thrown</b> out by grocers and butchers to bring back to his brother Homer. He also collected countless pieces of abandoned items and trash that aroused his interest.|$|R

2500|$|So I’m not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> away my short {{allotment}} {{of life on}} a futile, silly hope, searching for something there simply cannot be, a completely blameless man—not among us mortals who must win our bread from the broad earth.

But not even the gods can resist necessity.|$|E
2500|$|On defense, Walker had {{extensive}} knowledge {{of where to}} play for each hitter, what the pitcher was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw,</b> and where to position himself accordingly. [...] He understands how to read the path and angle of the ball and how it ricocheted off the wall. [...] His arm strength and accuracy often made it intimidating for baserunners to take extra bases. [...] He is adept at mimicking catching long fly balls and line drives {{that he was actually}} unable to catch, often fooling hitters into settling for singles when they could have taken extra bases.|$|E

He stuck on one of the stamps he 'ad found in George's pocket, and opening the door just afore <b>going</b> <b>to</b> bed <b>threw</b> it out on the pavement.|$|R
5000|$|In 1985, Thompson {{was cast}} in the West End revival of the musical Me and My Girl, co-starring Robert Lindsay.

Bachmann feels Petry is putting freedom of religion ahead of a kid's right to be unharmed.|$|R
2500|$|Coach Tice {{discussed}} the strategy, explaining that Moss would be running more short and intermediate routes and fewer deep patterns. In training camp, Moss worked specifically on 12 new routes {{that he had}} rarely run in his first 4 NFL seasons, such as crossing patterns over {{the middle of the}} field and hook routes. Coach Tice said, [...] "When we say Randy Ratio, everybody in the league thinks, 'OK, now they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> the ball down the field to Randy more and more and more.' That's so far from the truth. In fact, we'll probably throw the ball down the field to Randy this year even less." ...|$|E

2500|$|Maddux {{has been}} {{credited}} {{by many of}} his teammates with a superior ability to outthink his opponents and anticipate results. Braves catcher Eddie Pérez {{tells the story of}} Maddux intentionally allowing a home run to the Astros's Jeff Bagwell, in anticipation of facing Bagwell in the playoffs months later. Maddux felt Bagwell would instinctively be looking for the same pitch again, which Maddux would then refuse to throw. On another occasion while sitting on the bench, Maddux once told his teammates, [...] "Watch this, we might need to call an ambulance for the first base coach." [...] The batter, Los Angeles' José Hernández, drove the next pitch into the chest of the Dodgers' first base coach. Maddux had noticed that Hernández, who'd been pitched inside by Braves pitching during the series, had shifted his batting stance slightly. On another occasion, a former teammate, outfielder Marquis Grissom, recalled a game in 1996 when Maddux was having trouble spotting his fastball. Between innings, he told Grissom, [...] "Gary Sheffield is coming up next inning. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> him a slider and make him just miss it so he hits it to the warning track."
