5|$|After the 1973 oil crisis, the Brazilian {{government}} made mandatory {{the use of}} ethanol blends with gasoline, and neat ethanol-powered cars (E100 only) were launched to the market in 1979, after testing with several prototypes developed by four carmakers. Brazilian carmakers modified gasoline engines to support ethanol characteristics and changes included compression ratio, amount of <b>fuel</b> <b>injected,</b> replacement of materials that would get corroded by the contact with ethanol, use of colder spark plugs suitable for dissipating heat due to higher flame temperatures, and an auxiliary cold-start system that injects gasoline from a small tank in the engine compartment to help starting when cold.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Cylinder {{head and}} <b>fuel</b> <b>injecting</b> {{vibration}} consist of rich {{information about the}} working state of the locomotive engine, which shows important potential on the engine fault online diagnosis and regular maintenance. Through acquiring the cylinder head and <b>fuel</b> <b>injecting</b> vibration signals, comparing with the standard signals, fault diagnosis strategy is researched. By analyzing the cylinder head vibration curve with the method of vibration comparison value, the working states of all the cylinders are obtained. With the vibration curve of the <b>fuel</b> <b>injecting,</b> {{the problem of the}} injectors is found which helps to locate the fault. The strategy is applied to the No. 0015 locomotive of the Rizhao Seaport Transportation Company. The matching between the analysis result and practical locomotive state shows the validity of the strategy which can dramatically improve the maintaining efficiency as well as decrease the degree of over maintenance and lack of maintenance...|$|R
50|$|Multipoint fuel {{injection}} (also called PFI, port <b>fuel</b> injection) <b>injects</b> <b>fuel</b> into the intake ports just upstream of each cylinder's intake valve, {{rather than at}} a central point within an intake manifold. MPI systems can be sequential, in which injection is timed to coincide with each cylinder's intake stroke; batched, in which <b>fuel</b> is <b>injected</b> to the cylinders in groups, without precise synchronization to any particular cylinder's intake stroke; or simultaneous, in which <b>fuel</b> is <b>injected</b> {{at the same time}} to all the cylinders. The intake is only slightly wet, and typical fuel pressure runs between 40-60 psi.|$|R

25|$|It was marketed in Ecuador, Chile, Canada and the U.S. from 1985 to 1988 – with Suzuki {{offering}} the supermini {{with either a}} carbureted 1.0-liter inline-three cylinder or <b>fuel</b> <b>injected</b> 1.0-liter inline 3 cylinder turbocharged engine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fuel</b> <b>injected,</b> US-specification {{versions}} of the Alfetta were sold as limited editions in some European countries; one example was the 1981 Alfetta LI America for the Italian market, based on the North American Sport Sedan.|$|E
25|$|Motor Trend {{tested a}} four-speed <b>fuel</b> <b>injected</b> version with 3.70:1 axle. They {{reported}} a 0-60mph in 5.8 seconds and a 14.5-second standing quarter-mile at 102mph. The magazine also recorded better than 18 {{miles per gallon}} at legal highway speeds and 14.1 mpg overall.|$|E
40|$|Ignition-lag {{data have}} been {{obtained}} for seven <b>fuels</b> <b>injected</b> into heated, compressed air under conditions simulating those in a compression-ignition engine. The results of the bomb tests have been compared with similar engine data, and {{the differences between the}} two sets of results are explained in terms of the response of each fuel to variations in air density and temperature...|$|R

50|$|Propellant {{pumps are}} usually present {{to raise the}} {{propellant}} pressure above the pressure in the combustion chamber so that the <b>fuel</b> can be <b>injected.</b> <b>Fuel</b> pumps are usually driven by the main shaft, via gearing.|$|R
25|$|For the Mark VI, {{launched}} in 1990, the engine mounting points were moved forward to take 1,275cc power units, and includes the HIF carburettor version, plus the single point <b>fuel</b> <b>injected</b> car {{which came out}} in 1991. The 998cc power units were discontinued. Internal bonnet release were fitted from 1992.|$|E
25|$|The 75 engine range at launch {{featured}} four-cylinder 1.6-, 1.8- and 2.0-litre petrol carbureted engines, a 2.0-litre intercooled turbodiesel made by VM Motori, and a 2.5-litre <b>fuel</b> <b>injected</b> V6. In 1986, the 75 Turbo was introduced, {{which featured}} a fuel-injected 1779 cc twin-cam engine using Garrett T3 turbocharger, intercooler and oil cooler.|$|E
25|$|South African {{models were}} first {{assembled}} at Automaker's Rosslyn plant, located outside Pretoria. These early, 1973 models, were manufactured alongside Datsuns. From 1974 South African Alfetta's were manufactured at Alfa Romeo's own Brits plant. The 1600 model, with single headlamps as in Europe, arrived {{to complement the}} 1800 and 2000 in mid-1976. Beginning in October 1982, the Quadrifoglio Oro model was marketed as the Alfa Romeo 159i, with the <b>fuel</b> <b>injected</b> two liter engine.|$|E

50|$|Knocking {{is more or}} less {{unavoidable}} in diesel engines, where <b>fuel</b> is <b>injected</b> into highly {{compressed air}} {{towards the end of the}} compression stroke. There is a short lag between the <b>fuel</b> being <b>injected</b> and combustion starting. By this time there is already a quantity of fuel in the combustion chamber which will ignite first in areas of greater oxygen density prior to the combustion of the complete charge. This sudden increase in pressure and temperature causes the distinctive diesel 'knock' or 'clatter', some of which must be allowed for in the engine design.|$|R
25|$|After {{updating}} the factory team cars {{with a larger}} 1701cc Cosworth BDB engine in 1972 and then with <b>fuel</b> <b>injected</b> BDC, Ford also produced an RS2000 model {{as an alternative to}} the somewhat temperamental RS1600, featuring a 2.0L Pinto (OHC) engine. This also clocked up some rally and racing victories; and pre-empted the hot hatch market as a desirable but affordable performance road car. Like the Mexico and RS1600, this car was produced at the Aveley plant.|$|E
25|$|In 1988 engines were updated again, the 1.8 L {{carburetor}} {{version was}} replaced with <b>fuel</b> <b>injected</b> 1.8 i.e. and new bigger diesel engine {{was added to the}} range. In the end of 1989 the 1.6 L carburetor version was updated to have fuel injection and 1990 the 1.8 L turbo and 3.0i V6 got some more power and updated suspension. The 3.0 V6 was now equipped with a Motronic system instead of an L-Jetronic. The 1.8L turbo was now also available in 'America'-spec, but strangely enough not available for the USA market. The 3.0 V6 did make it to the United States, and was sold as Milano Verde.|$|E
25|$|South African {{models were}} first {{assembled}} at Automaker's Rosslyn plant, located outside Pretoria. These early, 1973 models, were manufactured alongside Datsuns. From 1974 South African Alfetta's were manufactured at Alfa Romeo's own Brits plant. South Africa {{was one of}} two markets to have a turbocharged GTV6, with a Garrett turbocharger and a NACA intake. An estimated 750 were assembled before all production ceased in 1986. The South African market also introduced the 3.0L GTV-6, predating the international debut of the factory's 3.0L engine in 1987. 212 were built in South Africa for racing homologation. The last 6 GTV-6 3.0's were <b>fuel</b> <b>injected.</b> To this day, the GTV-6 remains the quintessential Alfa Romeo for South Africans.|$|E
50|$|In {{a direct}} {{injection}} engine, <b>fuel</b> is <b>injected</b> into the combustion chamber {{as opposed to}} injection before the intake valve (petrol engine) or a separate pre-combustion chamber (diesel engine).|$|R
50|$|The {{engine control}} unit is central to an EFI system. The ECU interprets data from input sensors to, among other tasks, {{calculate}} the appropriate amount of <b>fuel</b> to <b>inject.</b>|$|R
50|$|In hot bulb engines, <b>fuel</b> is <b>injected</b> at low pressure, using a more {{economical}} and more reliable, and simpler configuration. However, by not using compressed air injection {{it is less}} efficient.|$|R
25|$|The German air {{crews were}} overall more {{experienced}} but {{the standard of}} fighter aircraft was even. The Bf 109E was slightly better in all round performance than the Hawker Hurricane, however the Bf 109 and the Supermarine Spitfire were equally matched. The Bf 109 was faster at high altitude and the Spitfire had the advantage at medium heights. The Messerschmitts carried heavy armament {{in the shape of}} two 20mm MG FF cannons. A significant advantage for the German fighter was its <b>fuel</b> <b>injected</b> engine, which allowed it to perform negative-G maneuvers without the engine cutting-out. The Spitfire and Hurricane lacked this capability. The twin-engined Messerschmitt Bf 110 had performed well in the earlier campaigns. It was well-armed and had the range to escort the bombers deep into enemy territory, which the Bf 109 lacked. Its fatal flaw was that in comparison to the British fighters it was unmaneuverable and therefore vulnerable.|$|E
25|$|The team ran the 1987 HDT VL {{during the}} 1988 Australian Touring Car Championship while the {{evolution}} car was homologated {{and prepared for}} later in the season. In the 1988 ATCC, the Commodore's were really just making up the numbers against the Ford Sierra RS500's and the best Perkins could manage was a 3rd at Sandown (during the season, Perkins had actually been testing {{one of the new}} <b>fuel</b> <b>injected</b> Commodore's and became increasingly frustrated at the delays in debuting the car). Jeff Allam and Armin Hahne, both with long associations with TWR, joined the team for the Sandown 500, with Perkins and Hulme sharing a brand new Holden VL Commodore SS Group A SV while Allam and Hahne drove Perkins old VL updated to TWR specs. Hahne, who in 1988 had been driving a Ford Sierra for Walter Wolf Racing in the European Touring Car Championship and the German DTM series, was a late replacement for Tom Walkinshaw, who was unable to drive as scheduled due to the death of his father. Perkins and Hulme had a strong race at Sandown, finishing second behind the Sierra of Allan Moffat and Gregg Hansford, while the Allam/Hulme car failed to finish.|$|E
500|$|The {{segment of}} US 9 in New Jersey was {{mentioned}} in the Bruce Springsteen song [...] "Born to Run" [...] in the lines [...] "Sprung from cages on Highway 9 / Chrome wheeled, <b>fuel</b> <b>injected</b> and steppin' out over the line." ...|$|E
50|$|In non-diesel {{internal}} combustion engines, {{gasoline direct injection}} (GDI), also known as petrol direct injection, direct petrol injection, spark-ignited direct injection (SIDI) and fuel-stratified injection (FSI), is a variant of fuel injection employed in modern two-stroke and four-stroke gasoline engines. The gasoline is highly pressurized, and injected via a common rail fuel line directly into the combustion chamber of each cylinder, as opposed to conventional multipoint <b>fuel</b> injection that <b>injects</b> <b>fuel</b> into the intake tract or cylinder port. Directly <b>injecting</b> <b>fuel</b> into the combustion chamber requires high-pressure injection, whereas low pressure is used injecting into the intake tract or cylinder port.|$|R
5000|$|Bivalent engines {{can also}} use {{hydrogen}} fuel, {{as demonstrated by the}} BMW [...] Hydrogen 7 using a bivalent V12 H7 Series engine. The engine itself is similar to a regular gasoline combustion engine, except for the fuel injection system. When a BMW Hydrogen 7 is running in gasoline mode, the <b>fuel</b> is <b>injected</b> directly into the cylinders, but when the vehicle is running on hydrogen, the <b>fuel</b> is <b>injected</b> into the intake manifold. BMW claims the Hydrogen 7 is the “world’s first production-ready hydrogen vehicle”, although only 100 total vehicles have been produced, and no more are planned to be produced.|$|R
50|$|The M110.984 was {{the first}} engine with the new Bosch K-Jetronic injection. This system is mechanical. The air that is taken in is weighed to the {{determine}} the amount of <b>fuel</b> to <b>inject.</b>|$|R
500|$|A key {{innovation}} in the Brazilian flex technology was avoiding {{the need for an}} additional dedicated sensor to monitor the ethanol-gasoline mix, which made the first American M85 flex fuel vehicles too expensive. This was accomplished through the lambda probe, used to measure the quality of combustion in conventional engines, is also required to tell the engine control unit (ECU) which blend of gasoline and alcohol is being burned. This task is accomplished automatically through software developed by Brazilian engineers, called [...] "Software Fuel Sensor" [...] (SFS), fed with data from the standard sensors already built-in the vehicle. The technology was developed by the Brazilian subsidiary of Boschin 1994, but was further improved and commercially implemented in 2003 by the Italian subsidiary of Magneti Marelli, located in Hortolândia, São Paulo. A similar fuel injection technology was developed by the Brazilian subsidiary of Delphi Automotive Systems, and it is called [...] "Multifuel", based on research conducted at its facility in Piracicaba, São Paulo. This technology allows the controller to regulate the amount of <b>fuel</b> <b>injected</b> and spark time, as fuel flow needs to be decreased and also self-combustion needs to be avoided when gasoline is used because ethanol engines have compression ratio around 12:1, too high for gasoline.|$|E
500|$|In 1960, Charles Harvard Gibbs-Smith, {{aviation}} {{historian at}} the Science Museum in London, {{reacted to the}} mid-1950s assertion that Coandă built and flew the first jet engine aircraft. Gibbs-Smith wrote that [...] "there has recently arisen some controversy about this machine, designed by the Rumanian-born and French-domiciled Henri Coanda, which was exhibited at the Paris salon in October 1910. Until recently it has been accepted as an all-wood sesquiplane, with cantilever wings, powered by a 50hp Clerget engine driving a 'turbo-propulseur' {{in the form of}} a large but simple ducted air fan. This fan was fitted right across the machine's nose and the cowling covered the nose and part of the engine: the resulting 'jet' of plain air was to propel the aeroplane." [...] He wrote that [...] "no claims that it flew, or was even tested, were made at the time", and that the story of it flying suddenly appeared in the 1950s—the aircraft was thus [...] "disinterred from its obscurity." [...] He wrote that the airfield at Issy-les-Moulineaux, a former military exercise ground where the test supposedly took place, was under the constant observation of the French Army who owned it, by French aviation reporters and photographers, and by aviation experts from other countries. He said that the airfield was the [...] "most famous, most used, most observed, and most reported-on 'airfield' in Paris", and that all events, let alone an exciting crash and destruction by fire, would have been carried in local papers and described in military reports, but no contemporary accounts exist of the Coandă-1910 being tested, flown or destroyed. Gibbs-Smith countered the Coandă assertions point by point, saying that the aircraft did not have a retractable undercarriage, did not have leading or trailing edge wing slots, did not have a fuel tank overhead in the wing, and did not have <b>fuel</b> <b>injected</b> into any turbine. Gibbs-Smith pointed out that the pilot would have been killed by the heat if any combustion had been initiated in the engine's air stream.|$|E
