5|$|Alpha {{transparency}} in PNG-format images: The {{eyes of the}} smiley face use alpha transparency, {{which is part of}} the 1996 Portable Network Graphics specification. Alpha transparency blends the eyebrows <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> smoothly and elegantly. This was a significant issue because Internet Explorer 6, the most widely used web browser at the time Acid2 was released, did not support alpha transparency. This deficiency was rectified in Internet Explorer 7, bringing Internet Explorer in line with other web browsers in this regard.|$|E
5|$|It was at {{this stage}} that the attack began to go seriously wrong. Strong winds blowing off the land swept the smoke screen <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of the {{advancing}} cruisers, blinding their commanders who attempted to navigate by dead reckoning. The same wind disclosed the Inshore Squadron to the German defenders who immediately opened up a withering fire on the blockships. With their volunteer crews suffering heavy casualties, the commanders increased speed despite the poor visibility and continued groping through the narrow channels inshore, searching for the Stroom Bank buoy which directed shipping into the canal.|$|E
5|$|That year, the Red Sox won an eventful season {{series against}} the Yankees. A 13-inning {{comeback}} win for the Yankees on July 1 was punctuated by a catch from Derek Jeter, who ran and dove into the stands at full speed and came out with facial lacerations when Trot Nixon hit a pop up in an area deep behind third base. On July 24, Jason Varitek shoved his glove <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of the Yankees' Álex Rodríguez after Rodríguez {{was hit by a}} pitch from Bronson Arroyo, causing a bench-clearing brawl. Though he was ejected (along with Rodríguez) from the game following the incident, the moment sparked Boston to an 11–10 come-from-behind victory. Both Rodríguez and Varitek were each suspended four games and fined $2,000 for the brawl.|$|E

5|$|Several minutes later, {{the main}} body of the raid reached the {{southern}} shore of Førde Fjord travelling north. To their surprise, the Allied planes passed directly over the German ships and came under intense attack from anti-aircraft guns, though no aircraft were hit. In response, Milson wheeled his force to the right in an attempt to attack the ships from east to west as planned. The steep walls of the fjord protected Z33 from attack from this direction, however. As a result, Milson led the force west to near the mouth of the fjord and ordered the Beaufighters to attack in relays from west to east. This required the aircraft to fly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of alerted German defences and then escape over steep mountains. The narrow confines of the fjord also meant that the Beaufighters had to attack individually from a single direction and would not be able to swamp the German defences as they normally sought to do.|$|E
5|$|The film's prologue {{shows the}} {{preparations}} {{for a hot}} air balloon ride. The balloon is tethered to the spire of a church next to a river, with a man named Yefim (Nikolay Glazkov) attempting to make the flight by use of a harness roped beneath the balloon. At the very moment of his attempt an ignorant mob arrive from the river and attempt to thwart the flight, putting a firebrand <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> {{of one of the}} men on the ground assisting Yefim. In spite of this the balloon is successfully released and Yefim is overwhelmed and delighted by the view from above and the sensation of flying, but he can not prevent a crash landing shortly after. He is the first of several creative characters, representing the daring escapist, whose hopes are easily crushed. After the crash, a horse is seen rolling on its back by a pond, a symbol of life–one of many horses in the movie.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, the two {{armies of}} unequal {{strength}} {{faced each other}} across frozen fields fissured by ice-covered streams and ponds, which were in turn covered by snow and drifts. The snow and gloom meant that neither side {{was aware of the}} inequalities of men and artillery. Napoleon opened the engagement by sending Soult's's corps, which successfully pushed the Russian right flank back, nearly turning the Russian force. To follow up on this success, he ordered Pierre Augereau's force to attack the left center. No sooner had Augereau and VII Corps, plus St. Hilaire's division, sallied out when a sudden snow storm engulfed the battle field. In white-out conditions, Augereau's entire corps disappeared in a flurry of whirling snow. When the snow cleared, friend and foe alike discovered that the first units onto the field had wandered off course. The line of march should have taken them directly to the Russian flank; have no point of reference, they had instead followed the terrain and led the entire corps parallel to the Russian line, along a V-shaped formation in which the left and center merged, and directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of the Russian 70–gun batteries. The artillery, although shocked to find a French Corps advancing straight toward them, immediately opened fire, as did the Russian infantry on both sides of Augereau's corps.|$|E

Fonteyn said herself that out of all her partners, Helpmann was her favourite. He was also extremely confident and always pushed Fonteyn to her highest potential. The novel also says that Helpmann would stand up to anyone, {{and that he could}} look <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of the devil himself and laugh.|$|E

The male's urination is meant to repel other males from his partner while the female's urination is a rejection of any approaching male when she is not receptive. Both anal digging and urination are more frequent during the breeding season and are more commonly done by males.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, the Coca-Cola Company {{announced}} {{it would no longer}} conduct or directly fund laboratory experiments on animals unless required by law to do so. The company's announcement came after PETA criticized the company for funding invasive experiments on animals including one study in which experimenters cut <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of chimpanzees to study the animals' nerve impulses used in the perception of sweet taste. Some experimenters have criticized PETA's campaign against Coca-Cola and other companies claiming that their work would be undermined if they lost corporate funding.|$|E
25|$|The study The Evolution of the Human Breast (2001) {{proposed}} that the rounded shape of a woman's breast evolved to prevent the sucking infant offspring from suffocating while feeding at the teat; that is, because of the human infant's small jaw, which did not project from the face to reach the nipple, {{he or she might}} block the nostrils against the mother's breast if it were of a flatter form (cf. chimpanzee). Theoretically, as the human jaw receded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> the woman's body compensated with round breasts.|$|E

25|$|Post-war {{tunnelling}} {{took place}} in less urgent circumstances and new, less damaging, tunnelling methods were used. Explosives were employed again but this time in smaller quantities, placed in drill holes bored <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of the excavation. They were fired electrically in a sequence {{which began in the}} centre of the face and spread outwards, so that the centre would create a void into which the peripheral rock could fall. The downside of this method was that it created tunnels with jagged sides, as it fractured the limestone around the periphery of the excavation.|$|E
25|$|The boiler used a ‘Forced Draught’ {{provided}} by a mechanical blower (the triangular structure on the right in the illustration). This forced air along a pipe and into the sealed ashpan (below the fire). Very few steam locomotives have ever used a forced draught like this, the main reason is {{that in order to}} add fuel either the draft must be stopped or some form of airlock fitted. Novelty used an airlock to feed the fuel in, but there was still a chance of flame and hot gases being blown <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of the fireman.|$|E

25|$|Illustrations of {{theatrical}} masks from 5th century display helmet-like masks, covering the entire face and head, with holes {{for the eyes}} and a small aperture for the mouth, {{as well as an}} integrated wig. These paintings never show actual masks on the actors in performance; they are most often shown being handled by the actors before or after a performance, that liminal space between the audience and the stage, between myth and reality. This demonstrates {{the way in which the}} mask was to 'melt' <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> and allow the actor to vanish into the role. Effectively, the mask transformed the actor as much as memorization of the text. Therefore, performance in ancient Greece did not distinguish the masked actor from the theatrical character.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, Bland had {{his best}} season for St Kilda, despite making limited appearances. A groin injury and broken finger ended his season in round 10. He played just seven league games, but polled eight Brownlow Medal votes, {{the only time}} in his career that he {{featured}} in the count. His efforts during the season were enough to win the Grosvenor Trophy, an award for St Kilda's best player, voted on by the club's past players and officials. He also finished third in the St Kilda best and fairest award. The season wasn't without incident for Bland, in round two he was cited for throwing the ball <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of Essendon's Doug Bigelow, which the tribunal deemed to have been intentional and suspended him for two weeks.|$|E
25|$|Despite all {{the foul}} weather facing the ABA, Mennenga, who {{was said to}} be an eternal optimist, hung on. There was one {{instance}} that was probably responsible for him relinquishing his position and BMX the sport he had help nurture, all together. On January 27, 1985, at the GT Supernationals in Pico Rivera, California, a disgruntled woman hurled a cup of coffee <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of Mennenga. In all his years involved in BMX he had never been attacked physically, but that was only the beginning of his humiliation. After ABA security had to physically remove the spectator from the facility, she filed a false police report that Mennenga assaulted her. The Pico Rivera police came down to the track and arrested Mennenga during the event. The true story eventually came up and the charges were dropped and Mennenga released, but very likely the experience forever soured him on the sport he once loved.|$|E
