50|$|The wall {{piece was}} {{a type of}} firearm used during the 18th century by the {{national}} and colonial armies of most European countries. Essentially, it was a scaled-up version of the army's standard infantry musket, operating under the same principles, but with a bore of up to one-inch (25.4 mm) calibre. These weapons filled a gap in firepower between the musket and the lightest artillery pieces, such as the swivel <b>gun.</b> <b>Wall</b> pieces were so named because {{they were designed to}} be used along the walls of fortifications. They were equipped with a yoke at the point of balance, which tapered into a pivot, which could be inserted into several sockets along the walls, which would absorb the recoil of the piece and also provide a stable gun platform. (In this respect they were much like a scaled-down version of the swivel <b>gun.)</b> <b>Wall</b> pieces could also be mounted on very light carriages for service in the field, usually in support of the larger guns. They were also used on small naval vessels.|$|E

40|$|The {{first known}} gun barrel {{thermochemical}} erosion modeling code is presented. This modeling code provides the necessary missmg element needed {{for developing a}} generalized gun barrel erosion modeling code that can provide analysis and design information that is unattainable by experiment alone. At the cunent stage of code development, single-shot comparisons can be made of either the same <b>gun</b> <b>wall</b> material for different rounds or different <b>gun</b> <b>wall</b> materials for the same round. This complex computer analysis is based on rigoroxis scientific thermochemical erosion considerations that have been validated in the reentry nosetip and rocket nozzle community over the last forty years.

2500|$|The type 26 is {{a simple}} square in plan, each wall being [...] long. There is a door in one side and embrasures {{in each of the}} {{remaining}} three walls with, possibly, an additional embrasure next to the door. There are no internal walls.

5000|$|When [...] {{captured}} the Genoese privateer Liguria on 7 August 1798, Espoirs captain, Commander Loftus Otway Bland, catalogued Ligurias armaments as: 12 long 18-pounders, four long 12-pounders, 10 long 6-pounders, 12 long wall-pieces, and four swivel <b>guns.</b> Mentions of <b>wall</b> <b>guns</b> are rare in such enumerations; {{what is more}} common are mentions of the swivel gun. These, though, were shorter than <b>wall</b> <b>guns,</b> did not have stocks, and generally fired 1 or 1½-pounder round shot.|$|R

50|$|A breech-loading <b>wall</b> <b>gun</b> {{was issued}} to the French army in 1819 {{for the defense}} of towns.

50|$|A wall gun's barrel {{could be}} over 4.5 ft in length with a bore {{of at least}} 1 in. This made them more {{accurate}} than the standard flintlock or matchlock musket. George Washington acquired several <b>wall</b> <b>guns</b> during the American War of Independence; tests showed that they were capable of hitting a sheet of common writing paper at 600 yard m. <b>Wall</b> <b>guns</b> {{were part of the}} standard equipment of some artillery pieces at that time.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} plasma accelerator for {{a variety}} of applications under development at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center is described. The accelerator is a pulsed plasma thruster and has been tested experimentally and plasma jet velocities of approximately 50 kilometers per second have been obtained. The plasma jet structure has been photographed with 10 ns exposure times to reveal a stable and repeatable plasma structure. Data for velocity profile information has been obtained using light pipes embedded in the <b>gun</b> <b>walls</b> to record the plasma transit at various barrel locations. Preliminary spatially resolved spectral data and magnetic field probe data are also presented. A high speed triggering system has been developed and tested as a means of reducing the gun "jitter". This jitter has been characterized and future work for second generation "ultra-low jitter" gun development is identified...|$|R
50|$|The EIC {{completed}} the fort in 1699. The fort was square, with four bastions, {{each of which}} mounted eight <b>guns.</b> The <b>walls</b> between the bastions had seven or eight guns. In addition, there was a battery of some 20 guns facing the sea. The fort had a garrison of 400 Europeans and 70-80 topasses.|$|R

40|$|Plasma jets {{with high}} {{momentum}} flux density {{are required for}} a variety of applications in propulsion research. Methods of producing these plasma jets are being investigated at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. The experimental goal in the immediate future is to develop plasma accelerators which are capable of producing plasma jets with momentum flux density represented by velocities up to 200 km/s and ion density up to 10 (exp 24) per cu m, with sufficient precision and reproducibility in their properties, and with sufficiently high efficiency. The jets must be sufficiently focused to allow them to be transported over several meters. A plasma accelerator concept is presented that might be able to meet these requirements. It is a self-switching, shaped coaxial pulsed plasma thruster, with focusing of the plasma flow by shaping muzzle current distribution as in plasma focus devices, and by mechanical tapering of the <b>gun</b> <b>walls.</b> Some 2 -D MHD modeling in support of the conceptual design will be presented...|$|R

50|$|<b>Wall</b> <b>guns</b> {{were large}} caliber smooth-bore muskets {{that were used}} in the 16th through 18th centuries by {{defending}} forces to break the advance of enemy troops. They were too heavy to be fired from the shoulder and so were usually rested on window ledges or low walls, hence the name. They were also known as Hackbuts, a name originally given to early medieval hand cannon. Many were fitted with a barrel hook to absorb shock. Some of these weapons had multiple barrels which enabled volleys to be fired much faster than a normal single shot <b>wall</b> <b>gun.</b>|$|R

40|$|Advanced high {{brightness}} RF gun injectors require photocathodes with fast response, high quantum efficiency and good surface uniformity. Metal films deposited by various techniques on the <b>gun</b> back <b>wall</b> could satisfy these requirements.

60|$|On the 18th {{the enemy}} {{came down in}} force and, for some hours, a {{tremendous}} musketry fire was kept up at the position; but the fire of the musketry and <b>guns,</b> from the <b>walls,</b> was so hot {{that they did not}} venture upon an attack.|$|R

60|$|The next morning, Charlie {{found that}} the enemy had, during the night, erected three {{batteries}} on the slopes facing the north wall of the town, that farthest removed from the castle. They at once opened fire, and the <b>guns</b> on the <b>walls</b> facing them replied, while those on the castle hurled their shot over the town into the enemy's battery. For three days, the artillery fire was kept up without intermission. The <b>guns</b> on the <b>wall</b> were too weak to silence the batteries of the besiegers, although these were much annoyed by the fire from the fort, which dismounted four of their guns, and blew up one of their magazines. Several times the town was set on fire by the shell from the French mortars; but Charlie had organized the irregulars into bands with buckets, and these succeeded in extinguishing the flames before they spread.|$|R
