40|$|This work {{presents}} an {{experimental study of}} the sulphur chemistry in oxy-fuel combustion of pulverized lignite. It has been observed that the emission of sulphur dioxide (SO 2) by unit energy supplied is lower in oxy-fuel combustion than in air combustion [1 - 5] but {{the reason for this}} is not clear. In order to validate previous work and to clarify this difference the present work compares the amount of emitted SO 2 in air and oxy-fuel combustion (wet and dry flue-gas recycle). Furthermore, the amounts of sulphur in the ash and in the water of the <b>flue-gas</b> <b>condenser</b> were determined to make a mass balance and to verify the measured amount of SO 2 in the flue gas...|$|E
40|$|Combustion {{of biomass}} for heat and power {{production}} is continuously growing in importance, because of incentives for replacing fossil energy resources with renewable ones. In biomass combustion, the moisture {{content of the}} fuel is an essential operation parameter, which often fluctuates for biomass fuels. Variation in moisture content complicates {{the operation of the}} furnaces and results in an uncertainty in the energy content of the fuel delivered to a plant. The fuel moisture-content in a furnace may be determined either by direct measurement on the entering fuel or by measuring the moisture and oxygen contents of the flue gases deriving the moisture content of the fuel. However, reliable methods of a motivated cost for the small to medium-scale furnaces are today not available. An exception is if the furnace is equipped with <b>flue-gas</b> <b>condenser,</b> which can be used to estimate the moisture content of the flue gases. A limitation of this method is, though, that not all furnaces have flue-gas condensers and that the measured signal has an inherent time delay. In thiswork, measurement of the relative humidity (RH) of the flue gases froma furnace is investigated as the central component in the on-line monitoring of the moisture content of the fuel in a furnace. The method was analysed with humid air in a laboratory environment and tested for accuracy and dynamical behaviour in two biomass-fired heat-production units, one circulating fluidised-bed boiler (CFB) and one grate furnace. The results show that the method, which is easy to calibrate on site, can be used to predict the moisture content of the biomass fuel in the grate furnace with very good precision (< 4 % error). Furthermore, the method detects variations in moisture content of the furnace flue gases due to changes in the moisture content of the combusted fuel within the order of seconds. Since the transport time of the flue gases from the furnace to the measurement position is of the same order of magnitude, the total time for detection of a change in the moisture content of the fuel is small enough for the signal to be used to control both the fuel feed and the combustion air in a grate furnace...|$|E
40|$|An {{approach}} {{proposed for}} removal of CO 2 from flue gas cools and compresses {{a portion of}} a recirculated <b>flue-gas</b> stream, <b>condensing</b> its volatile materials for capture. Recirculating the flue gas concentrates SOx, H 2 O and CO 2 while dramatically reducing N 2 and NOx, enabling this approach, which uses readily available industrial components. A hybrid system of indirect and direct-contact heat exchange performs heat and mass transfer for pollutant removal and energy recovery. Computer modeling and experimentation combine to investigate the thermodynamics, heat and mass transfer, chemistry and engineering design of this integrated pollutant removal (IPR) system...|$|R

This is particularly relevant for natural gas, whose high hydrogen content produces much water, when it is burned in condensing boilers and power plants with <b>flue-gas</b> condensation that <b>condense</b> the water vapor produced by combustion, recovering heat which would otherwise be wasted.|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{experiments}} in the Chalmers 100 kW(th) oxy-fuel test facility, this study presents an analysis of sulfur chemistry of pulverized lignite combustion, comparing oxy-fuel and air-fired conditions. Four test cases were investigated: an air-fired case, two oxy-fuel cases with dry recycling (30 and 35 vol % O- 2), and one oxy-fuel case with wet recycling (43 vol % O- 2 on a dry basis). The amounts of sulfur in the <b>flue-gas,</b> ashes, and <b>condensed</b> water from the condenser were quantified, and a sulfur mass balance was established. The composition of the ashes and the ash-forming matter in the fuel was analyzed. The ashes were investigated by X-ray diffraction, while the size of fuel and ash particles was determined by laser diffraction. In general, {{the results show that}} the lignite has a high sulfur self-retention by ash, especially in oxy-fuel combustion. The experiments also show that the conversion of fuel S to SO 2 from oxy-fuel combustion is around 35 % lower compared to air-fired conditions, whereas the flue-gas concentration of SO 2 is higher in oxy-fuel combustion because of the absence of air-borne nitrogen...|$|R
40|$|Oxy-fuel combustion, where air is {{replaced}} by O 2 and recycled flue-gas to enrich combustion products, {{is one of the}} main CO 2 capture technologies suitable for large-scale coal-fired power plants. The changed combustion conditions in oxy-fuel combustion influences the sulfur chemistry, which has recently been the subject of increased attention due to the importance of sulfur species in corrosion and flue-gas cleaning issues. In this thesis, the sulfur chemistry during oxy-fuel combustion was examined by both experimental and modeling studies. Since the formation of SO 3 plays a critical role in corrosion processes, the SO 3 formation was studied separately. Experiments were conducted in the Chalmers 100 kWth oxy-fuel test unit using pulverized coal as fuel. Oxy-fuel and air-fired conditions were compared in the experimental analysis aimed at quantifying the sulfur sinks. In each test case the quantity of sulfur in the fuel, <b>flue-gas,</b> ashes, and <b>condensed</b> water was determined. The composition of the fuel and ashes in the experiments was analyzed; the distribution of alkaline earth and alkali metals was of special concern because of their ability to retain sulfur in the ash. In a separate study, the gas-phase chemistry was investigated by means of a detailed kinetic gas-phase model. This part of the work mainly focused on the impact of the combustion atmospheres and parameters critical for SO 3 formation. The overall modeling results were compared to data obtained from experiments in the Chalmers oxy-fuel test unit. The experimental results show that the conversion of fuel-S to SO 2 is significantly lower in oxy-fuel combustion than in air-fired conditions and, consequently, the SO 2 emission, in mg/MJfuel, is reduced. However, the SO 2 concentration was more than three times higher during oxy-fuel combustion. The higher SO 2 concentration in oxy-fuel combustion is likely to increase sulfate formation, resulting in higher sulfur self-retention by ash. The increased SO 2 concentration promotes the formation of SO 3. This was confirmed by the model, which revealed SO 3 outlet concentrations that were several times higher under oxy-fuel conditions compared to air-fired conditions. The gas-phase formation of SO 3 is strongly dependent on the O 2 concentration and only significant in zones where O 2 is available and the temperature above 550 ËšC. The residence time of the flue-gas in the critical temperature window is another important factor in the formation of SO 3. Flue-gas recycling conditions and the location of flue-gas desulfurization equipment are therefore both important design criteria with respect to the formation and resulting concentration of SO 3...|$|R
