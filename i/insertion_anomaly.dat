Intrauterine fetal death, which was diagnosed prepartum at 40 weeks of gestation, was caused by hemorrhage of the fetus into the amniotic fluid following rupture of the umbilical vein {{at the site of}} furcate insertion of the umbilical cord. This <b>insertion</b> <b>anomaly</b> accompanied by rupture of a vessel occurs only very rarely but represents a placental cause of an abrupt and unpredicted end of a pregnancy.

40|$|The Lunar Prospector {{mission is}} the first {{dedicated}} NASA lunar mapping mission since the Apollo Orbiter program which was flown over 25 years ago. Competitively selected under the NASA Discovery Program, Lunar Prospector was launched on January 7, 1998 on the new Lockheed Martin Athena 2 launch vehicle. The mission design of Lunar Prospector {{is characterized by a}} direct minimum energy transfer trajectory to the moon with three scheduled orbit correction maneuvers to remove launch and cislunar injection errors prior to lunar insertion. At lunar encounter, a series of three lunar orbit insertion maneuvers and a small circularization burn were executed to achieve a 100 km altitude polar mapping orbit. This paper will present the design of the Lunar Prospector transfer, lunar insertion and mapping orbits, including maneuver and orbit determination strategies in the context of mission goals and constraints. Contingency plans for handling transfer orbit injection and lunar orbit <b>insertion</b> <b>anomalies</b> are also summarized. Actual flight operations results are discussed and compared to pre-launch support analysis...|$|R

40|$|Centurion {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} medial canthal tendon <b>insertion</b> <b>anomaly</b> that causes epiphora in young adults. The {{purpose of the current}} study is to describe the clinical signs and outcome of surgery in a 18 -year-old male patient with Centurion syndrome. Ophthalmic examination revealed bilateral loss of lid globe apposition medially, with anterior displacement of the lacrimal puncta out of the tear lake and a prominent nasal bridge. The patient, whose findings were consistent with Centurion syndrome, underwent bilateral medial canthal tendon release and medial tarsoconjunctival resection. Tearing was completely resolved after surgery. Anterior medial canthal tendon release with medial conjunctivoplasty is an effective surgical approach in patients with Centurion syndrome.

40|$|A new {{normal form}} for {{relational}} databases, called domain-key normal form (DK/NF), is defined. Also, formal definitions of <b>insertion</b> <b>anomaly</b> and deletion anomaly are presented. It is {{shown that a}} schema is in DK/NF {{if and only if}} it has no insertion or deletion anomalies. Unlike previously defined normal forms, DK/NF is not defined in terms of traditional dependencies (functional, multivalued, or join). Instead, it is defined in terms of the more primitive concepts of domain and key, along with the general concept of a “constraint. ” We also consider how the definitions of traditional normal forms might be modified by taking into consideration, for the first time, the combinatorial consequences of bounded domain sizes. It is shown that after this modification, these traditional normal forms are all implied by DK/NF. In particular, if all domains are infinite, then these traditional normal forms are all implied by DK/NF...|$|E

In this report the authors aim to report a child with a novel de novo interstitial deletion on chromosome 7, with the following karyotype: 46,XX,del(7) (p 14. 2 p 15. 1). We described a female, born at 38 weeks with intrauterine growth restriction and feeding problems with episodes of cyanosis after feedings and failure to thrive. Physical examination showed low implantation of ears, hypertelorism, oblique palpebral fissures, retrognathia, and palate ogived, with <b>insertion</b> <b>anomalies</b> of the toes, poor facial expression and mild axial hypotonia. Transfontanelar ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, bronchofibroscopy and metabolic studies were normal. She was hospitalized until the 32 nd day of life. She started speech therapy and presented improvements in swallowing. The percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy was removed at 36 months. She had recurrent urinary tract infection with normal dimercaptosuccinic acid but with a vesicoureteral reflux (grade III). Imagiological studies revealed a bilateral osteonecrosis of femoral epiphysis (Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease). Currently (6 years-old), she is being normally fed (body mass index= 15. 8 kg/m(2)). Her weight is 16. 4 kg (3 rd centile) and length is 105 cm (3 rd to 5 th centiles). She has a mild delay of psychomotor development impairment and some speech problems.

30|$|Ebstein’s anomaly is {{characterized}} by apical displacement of the tricuspid valve leaflets into the RV, which divides the RV into an ”atrialized” portion and a “functional” portion with intrinsic musculature, both of which show varying degrees of dysplasia, fibrosis and thinning. This anomaly is caused by failure of delamination of leaflets or incomplete extension medially of the valvular leaflet tissue from its origin from the ventricular wall. Ebstein’s anomaly primarily affects the septal and posterior leaflets of the tricuspid valve and their anomalous attachment to the valvular annular apparatus. The leaflets can be hypoplastic, aplastic, irregular or completely fused. The anterior leaflet may also be redundant, tethered, or exhibit fenestrations, or may be voluminous with a sail-like configuration. The tricuspid annulus has varying levels of rotation and obliquity. The chordae tendineae and papillary muscles have dysplasia and varying levels of myocardial <b>insertion.</b> Associated <b>anomalies</b> include patent foramen ovale (PFO), ASD and VSD.|$|R

Existing modelling techniques for business rules offer modellers guidelines on how to create models that are consistent, complete and syntactically correct. However, modelling guidelines that address manageability in terms of <b>anomalies</b> such as <b>insertion,</b> update and deletion are not widely available. This paper presents a normalisation procedure that provides guidelines for managing and organising business rules.

Most of the recent works on database normalization use a restricted definition of normal forms where only the primary key is taken into account and ignoring the rest of candidate keys. In this paper, we propose an algorithmic approach for database normalization up to third normal form by taking into account all candidate keys, including the primary key. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated on many real world examples...|$|R

40|$|A 43 -year-old {{woman was}} {{referred}} to our hospital with complaints of recurrent frequency and lower abdom-inal discomfort. Her past history was notable for recurrent acute cystitis. Urinalysis showed normal findings. Intravenous urography revealed bilateral ureteric duplication. The right side was shown as partial ureteric duplication, while left side was com-plete ureteric duplication demonstrating double ureters throughout their entire course without union (Figure 1). However, 3 -dimensional CT urography, reconstructed using 16 -multidetector computed tomo-graphy (CT), demonstrated bilateral incomplete double ureters. The duplicated ureters {{on the right side}} joined at the upper proximal part of ureter and duplicated ureters on the left side, put together at just above the ureterovesical junction (Figure 2). Discussion Double ureter refers to the presence of two separate ipsilateral ureters. It presents complete or incomplete ureteric duplication. Bilateral double ureters are much more rare than ipsilateral double ureters. The ureteric orifices are characteristically inverted, in relation to the renal unit they drain. The ureter of the lower renal unit drains to the normal ureteric insertion, while the ureter of the upper renal unit drains ectopically [1]. Patients with double ureters may be accompanied by other ureteral anomalies such as ectopic ureter and have an increased risk of developing urinary tract infection, pain, hydronephrosis and stone formation [2]. As shown in this case, 3 -dimensional CT urography helps us to clarify ureteric <b>insertion</b> or <b>anomalies.</b> Conflict of interest statement. None declared...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} good {{database}} logical design {{is to eliminate}} data redundancy and <b>insertion</b> and deletion <b>anomalies.</b> In order to achieve this objective for temporal databases, the notions of temporal types and temporal functional dependencies (TFDs) are introduced. A temporal type is a monotonic mapping from ticks of time (represented by positive integers) to time sets (represented by subsets of reals) and is used to capture various standard and user-defined calendars. A TFD is a proper extension of the traditional functional dependency and takes the form X Γ! Y, meaning {{that there is a}} unique value for Y during one tick of the temporal type for one particular X value. An axiomatization for TFDs is given. Since a finite set of TFDs usually implies an infinite number of TFDs, we introduce the notion of and give an axiomatization for a finite closure to effectively capture a finite set of implied TFDs that are essential to the logical design.

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} {{several areas}} of database modeling and design {{that have been}} problematic for students and even are likely to confuse faculty. Major contributing factors are the lack of clarity and inaccuracies that persist in the presentation of some basic database concepts in textbooks. The paper analyzes the problems and discusses ways to minimize them. Specifically, the paper discusses the practical role of normalization in database design, addresses the confusion in representing attributes with repeating values, discusses how to remove inconsistencies in defining relations and first normal form, simplifies the process of identifying candidate keys to normalize relations, clarifies {{the conditions under which}} <b>insertion</b> and deletion <b>anomalies</b> may occur, and sheds light on the confusion in defining weak entities. Normalization plays a vital role in both the theory and the practice of database design. The topdown approach popularly used in relational database design creates a conceptual schema that is represented by entity-relationship (E-R) models, and then uses mapping rules to convert the conceptual schema to relation schemas. Because E-R modeling is an intuitive process, errors could occur in identifying entities and their relationships, resulting in un-normalized relations. Unnormalized relations also could result from converting files in legacy systems and spreadsheets t...|$|R
40|$|Some {{research}} efforts have proposed the automation {{of the data}} warehouse design in order to free this task of being (completely) performed by an expert and facilitate the whole process. Most advanced approaches exclusively work over relational sources and perform {{a detailed analysis of}} the data sources to identify the multidimensional concepts in a reengineering process. Starting from a logical schema, however, may present some inconveniences. A logical schema is tied to the design decisions made when devising the system and these decisions either made to fulfill the system requirements (for instance, improve query answering, avoid <b>insertion</b> / deletion <b>anomalies,</b> preserve features inherited from legacy systems, etc.) or naively made by nonexpert users, have a big impact {{on the quality of the}} multidimensional schemas got by current automatable approaches. In this paper, we introduce our approach for automatically deriving the multidimensional schema from a domain ontology. Our goals are mainly two: i) we want to improve the quality of the output got (by working over a conceptual formalization of the domain instead of a logical one) and ii) we want to automate the process. This second goal is the main reason for choosing ontologies instead of other conceptual formalizations, as ontology languages provide reasoning services that will facilitate the automation of our task.

40|$|ISHM {{capability}} {{enables a}} system to detect anomalies, determine causes and effects, predict future anomalies, and provides an integrated awareness of {{the health of the}} system to users (operators, customers, management, etc.). NASA Stennis Space Center, NASA Ames Research Center, and Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne have implemented a core ISHM capability that encompasses the A 1 Test Stand and the J- 2 X Engine. The implementation incorporates all aspects of ISHM; from anomaly detection (e. g. leaks) to root-cause-analysis based on failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), to a user interface for an integrated visualization of the health of the system (Test Stand and Engine). The implementation provides a low functional capability level (FCL) in that it is populated with few algorithms and approaches for anomaly detection, and root-cause trees from a limited FMEA effort. However, it is a demonstration of a credible ISHM capability, and it is inherently designed for continuous and systematic augmentation of the capability. The ISHM capability is grounded on an integrating software environment used to create an ISHM model of the system. The ISHM model follows an object-oriented approach: includes all elements of the system (from schematics) and provides for compartmentalized storage of information associated with each element. For instance, a sensor object contains a transducer electronic data sheet (TEDS) with information that might be used by algorithms and approaches for anomaly detection, diagnostics, etc. Similarly, a component, such as a tank, contains a Component Electronic Data Sheet (CEDS). Each element also includes a Health Electronic Data Sheet (HEDS) that contains health-related information such as anomalies and health state. Some practical aspects of the implementation include: (1) near real-time data flow from the test stand data acquisition system through the ISHM model, for near real-time detection of anomalies and diagnostics, (2) insertion of the J- 2 X predictive model providing predicted sensor values for comparison with measured values and use in anomaly detection and diagnostics, and (3) <b>insertion</b> of third-party <b>anomaly</b> detection algorithms into the integrated ISHM model...|$|R
