5|$|Back at city hall, Ron (Nick Offerman) remains {{immobile}} in {{his chair}} all day due to a hernia which causes excruciating pain if he moves. Ron remains immobile <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> well into the night, until the janitors turn the lights off on him. The intern, April (Aubrey Plaza), returns to check on him, and wheels Ron {{out to the car}} on his office chair to bring him to the hospital.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{elimination}} of the United States ice hockey team, American television stations needed to fill airtime and chose to focus on the Jamaican bobsleigh team in the four-man event. The first run ended poorly, as when Dudley Stokes jumped into the bobsleigh, the push-bar in the sleigh broke, resulting in the team coming in third from last in 24th place. On their second attempt, the team ranked second to last, due in part to White struggling to crouch down properly <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat,</b> remaining almost upright through the first corner.|$|E

5|$|When Sir Daniel Levy {{retired from}} parliament, Weaver was elected as the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly on 4 August 1937. In 1938, he was cleared by a {{judicial}} inquiry, chaired by Sir Percival Halse Rogers, into Jack Lang's allegations {{of fraud and}} corruption {{in the sale of}} state enterprises in 1933 when Weaver was the Secretary for Public Works. At the 1939 election Weaver was returned uncontested. He served as Speaker until the succeeding government of Alexander Mair was defeated at the May 1941 election by the Labor Party under William McKell. Weaver was returned <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> uncontested.|$|E
5|$|In Queens, New York, police chase a sedan driven {{through a}} parking garage by two men keeping a teenage boy named Tyler Carson (Cameron Monaghan) in the backseat. Police {{officers}} surround the car and draw their weapons, demanding that the men exit the car. They do, and Tyler stays <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat.</b> Without explanation, {{one of the officers}} walks backwards to the parking ramp and jumps to his death. Another officer shoots her two remaining co-workers, then herself. The kidnappers' crime spree continues on the road. One of them, Hickey (John Tench), demands that a convenience store clerk hand over all his cash. Another customer tries to intervene, but then takes a pot of hot coffee, pours the coffee over his own head, and beats himself with the pot. The cashier then electrocutes himself.|$|E
5|$|Insistent {{that his}} party take an equal {{role in the}} {{coalition}} government, Bruxner formed a good working relationship and long-lasting friendship with Stevens that would ensure the government's stability. The Stevens government had significant success, reducing Lang's 2 million pound deficit by 75%. However, one significant problem was that Stevens had trouble with an unruly backbench, and increasingly depended upon Bruxner and the Country Party. As Deputy Premier, Bruxner saw himself as loyal to Stevens, but still managed to push through several initiatives that specifically benefited rural areas, including another royal commission {{on the question of}} new States in 1935. The May 1935 election saw Stevens and Bruxner retaining government against a divided and fractious Labor opposition and Bruxner was returned unopposed again <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E

25|$|Boy racers are {{typically}} known for speeding away from traffic lights, playing loud music, and revving their engines rather than actual street racing.

25|$|A {{few minutes}} later, Moutardier found Reid leaning over <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat,</b> and unsuccessfully {{attempted}} {{to get his}} attention. After she {{asked him what he}} was doing, Reid grabbed at her, revealing one shoe in his lap, a fuse leading into the shoe, and a lit match.

25|$|Charles Vine, who {{had been}} beguiled with Kate Claxton's nerve, was far away from those stairs. Claxton's assurances had induced him to wait <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> for a few minutes, but the crowd growing on the stairs made him uneasy. The sight of men {{trampling}} women appalled him; the din was maddening. He thought everyone was going crazy. Above all, dense smoke was beginning to fill the gallery, reducing visibility and making breathing difficult.|$|E
25|$|Democrat Neal Esposito died {{in office}} on October 23, 2014, and was reelected posthumously {{for a new}} three-year term in the November general election.

He was comfortably re-elected at the 2017 election, at which he led a Pangu Party comeback, with the once-dormant party winning a number of seats.|$|E

25|$|Although Allmand {{had been}} {{recruited}} by then mayor Gérald Tremblay for his party, {{he was not}} afraid to publicly criticize the mayor if he disagreed with city policy. Allmand once again showed an independent streak in 2005 by voting against Tremblay's motion to {{change the name of}} Park Avenue to Avenue Robert Bourassa. During his time on the council, he criticized the lack of transparency in urban planning for projects <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, while Michael Applebaum was mayor.

She received the maximum sentence of life in prison with parole eligibility in 30 years.|$|E
25|$|This {{choice was}} {{controversial}} since Holyoake was a sitting Cabinet minister. Both opponents {{and supporters of}} Muldoon's government claimed {{that it was a}} political appointment; a number of National MPs, including his deputy, disagreed with the precedent of having a politician as Governor-General. The Leader of the Opposition, Bill Rowling complained that he had not been consulted on the appointment and then stated that he would remove Holyoake as Governor-General should the Labour Party win the 1978 general election. As a result of the appointment, Holyoake resigned from Parliament, leading to the Pahiatua by-election of 1977. He was succeeded <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> by John Falloon.|$|E
