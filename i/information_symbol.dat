Hence, exploiting the underlying orthogonality in the codeword and carefully choosing the sequence of <b>information</b> <b>symbols</b> can bring benefits in terms of decoding complexity.|$|R

30|$|In this section, a low-complexity ML {{decoding}} algorithm {{exploiting the}} unique properties highlighted {{in the previous}} section is proposed for the 3 D MIMO code. Generally speaking, the complexity reduction is achieved in two steps. Based on Theorem 2, the joint detection of eight <b>information</b> <b>symbols</b> is converted into two partially independent detections of six <b>information</b> <b>symbols.</b> This step reduces the worst-case decoding complexity from O(M 8) to O(M 6). Consequently, using Theorem 1 and Corollary 1, the detections of complex <b>information</b> <b>symbols</b> are converted into independent detections of real and imaginary parts, which further reduces the worst-case complexity to O(M 4.5).|$|R

40|$|The {{original}} Luby Transform (LT) {{coding scheme}} is extended {{to account for}} data transmissions where some <b>information</b> <b>symbols</b> in a message block {{are more important than}} others. Prioritized LT codes provide unequal error protection (UEP) of data on an erasure channel by modifying the original LT encoder. The prioritized algorithm improves high-priority data protection without penalizing low-priority data recovery. Moreover, low-latency decoding is also obtained for high-priority data due to fast encoding. Prioritized LT codes only require a slight change in the original encoding algorithm, and no changes at all at the decoder. Hence, with a small complexity increase in the LT encoder, an improved UEP and low-decoding latency performance for high-priority data can be achieved. LT encoding partitions a data stream into fixed-sized message blocks each with a constant number of <b>information</b> <b>symbols.</b> To generate a code <b>symbol</b> from the <b>information</b> <b>symbols</b> in a message, the Robust-Soliton probability distribution is first applied {{in order to determine the}} number of <b>information</b> <b>symbols</b> to be used to compute the code symbol. Then, the specific <b>information</b> <b>symbols</b> are chosen uniform randomly from the message block. Finally, the selected <b>information</b> <b>symbols</b> are XORed to form the code symbol. The Prioritized LT code construction includes an additional restriction that code symbols formed by a relatively small number of XORed <b>information</b> <b>symbols</b> select some of these <b>information</b> <b>symbols</b> from the pool of high-priority data. Once high-priority data are fully covered, encoding continues with the conventional LT approach where code symbols are generated by selecting <b>information</b> <b>symbols</b> from the entire message block including all different priorities. Therefore, if code symbols derived from high-priority data experience an unusual high number of erasures, Prioritized LT codes can still reliably recover both high- and low-priority data. This hybrid approach decides not only "how to encode" but also "what to encode" to achieve UEP. Another advantage of the priority encoding process is that the majority of high-priority data can be decoded sooner since only a small number of code symbols are required to reconstruct high-priority data. This approach increases the likelihood that high-priority data is decoded first over low-priority data. The Prioritized LT code scheme achieves an improvement in high-priority data decoding performance as well as overall information recovery without penalizing the decoding of low-priority data, assuming high-priority data is no more than half of a message block. The cost is in the additional complexity required in the encoder. If extra computation resource is available at the transmitter, image, voice, and video transmission quality in terrestrial and space communications can benefit from accurate use of redundancy in protecting data with varying priorities...|$|R
