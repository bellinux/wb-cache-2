5|$|Activities {{that reduce}} {{physiological}} arousal and cognitive activity promote falling asleep, so engaging in relaxing activities before bedtime is recommended.

Trying purposefully to fall asleep may induce frustration that further prevents falling asleep, so in such situations a person may be advised to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bed and try something else for a brief amount of time.|$|E
