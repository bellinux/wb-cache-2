However, imposing this assumption on the continuously compounded interest rate has a serious drawback: expected rollover returns are innite even if the rollover period is arbitrarily short. As a consequence such models cannot price {{one of the most}} widely used hedging instrument on the <b>Euromoney</b> <b>market,</b> namely the Eurofuture contract. The purpose of this paper is to show that the problem with lognormal models result from modelling the wrong rate, namely the continuously compounded rate. If instead one models the eective annual rate the problem disappears, i. e. the expected rollover returns are nite. The paper studies the resulting dynamics of the continuously compounded rate which is neither normal nor lognormal. 1...|$|E
