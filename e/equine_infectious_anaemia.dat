50|$|Equine {{infectious}} anemia or <b>equine</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>anaemia</b> (EIA), {{also known}} by horsemen as swamp fever, is a horse disease {{caused by a}} retrovirus and transmitted by bloodsucking insects. The virus (EIAV) is endemic in the Americas, parts of Europe, the Middle and Far East, Russia, and South Africa. The virus is a lentivirus, like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Like HIV, EIA can be transmitted through blood, milk, and body secretions.Transmission is primarily through biting flies, such as the horse-fly and deer-fly. The virus survives up to 4 hours in the vector (epidemiology). Contaminated surgical equipment and recycled needles and syringes, and bits can transmit the disease. Mares can transmit the disease to their foals via the placenta.The risk of transmitting the disease is greatest when an infected horse is ill, as the blood levels of the virus are then highest.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: No {{cases of}} <b>equine</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>anaemia</b> (EIA) have been {{reported}} in Spain since 1983. Factors that could increase the risk of reintroducing <b>equine</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>anaemia</b> virus (EIAV) into Spain include the recent occurrence of the disease in Europe and the absence of compulsory serological testing before importation into Spain. Aims and objectives: Given the importance of the Spanish Purebred (SP) horse breeding industry in Spain, the aim of this cross-sectional study was to provide evidence of freedom from EIAV in SP stud farms in Central Spain. Materials and methods: Serum samples from 555 SP horses, collected between September 2011 and November 2013, were tested using a commercially available EIAV ELISA with a published sensitivity of 100 per cent.

Antibodies appeared within 35 days after inoculation, and development of which coincided well with that of precipitating and complement fixing antibodies. Titer of indirect hemagglutination antibodies were ten to 320 times greater than those of precipitating antibodies. Test results could be read more clearly by the indirect hemagglutination test especially in weakly positive cases. Ninety-six samples from suspected field cases collected from every region of Japan which were positive on the immunodiffusion test were also positive on indirect hemagglutination test.

40|$|Abstract. Neurologic disease occurs {{sporadically}} in horses {{infected with}} the <b>equine</b> <b>infectious</b> anemia virus (EIAV). This report describes a case of clinically severe neurologic disease in a pony experimentally infected with EIAV. This pony did not have fever or anemia, which are the characteristic clinical signs of disease. The histopathologic changes were characterized as lymphohistiocytic periventricular leukoencephalitis. Polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization data showed that the brain lesions were directly associated with viral replication and that high-level viral replication occurred selectively within the lesion and not in other tissues.
