40|$|Investigations of {{hydraulic}} {{operating conditions}} of air <b>lift</b> <b>pump</b> with {{three types of}} air-water mixers. The paper presents the analysis of results of the investigations concerning the influence of various constructive solutions of the air-water mixers on hydraulic operating conditions of the air <b>lift</b> <b>pump.</b> The scope of the investigations encompassed the determination of characteristics of delivery head and delivery rate for three types of air-water mixers applied in the constructed air <b>lift</b> <b>pump.</b> Using the obtained results, {{the efficiency of the}} three types of air-water mixers applied in this air <b>lift</b> <b>pump</b> was determined. The analysis was carried out and there was checked whether the improved analytical Stenning-Martin model can be used to design air <b>lift</b> <b>pumps</b> with the air-water mixers of these types. The highest capacity in the water transport was reached by the air <b>lift</b> <b>pump</b> with the 1 st type air-water mixer, the lowest one – with the 3 rd type air-water mixer. The water flow in the air <b>lift</b> <b>pump</b> increases along with the rise in the air flow. The lower are the hydraulic losses generated during flow of the air flux by the air-water mixer, the higher is the air <b>lift</b> <b>pump</b> capacity. Along with the rise in the water delivery head, the capacity of the air <b>lift</b> <b>pump</b> decreases. The highest efficiency is reached by the air <b>lift</b> <b>pump</b> with the 1 st type air-water mixer, the lowest – with the 3 st type air-water mixer. The efficiency of the air <b>lift</b> <b>pump</b> for the three investigated types of air-water mixers decreases along with the rise in air flow rate and water delivery head. The values of submergence ratio (h/L) of the delivery pipe, calculated {{with the use of the}} improved analytical Stenning-Martin model, coincide quite well with the values of h/L determined from the measurements...|$|R
5000|$|Ford {{also offered}} police {{versions}} of the 429 and 460. Horsepower ratings for the police version ranged anywhere from 240-375 hp (gross hp, the common hp rating of the era).The 1971 429 police interceptor, with 11:1 compression (which is a very slightly more powerful version of the 429 Cobra Jet) rated at 375 hp. [...] From 1973 to 1978 Ford offered two {{versions of the}} 460 police engine. The 460 Police Cruiser (460 PC), identified by engine code [...] "A" [...] in the installed vehicle's vehicle VIN number and the engine's valve cover spec sticker, and the 460 Police Interceptor (460 PI) identified by the engine code [...] "C" [...] in its vehicle VIN number and on its spec sticker. The two were commonly confused with each other, the [...] "A" [...] code 460 being a basic, street/production stock flowing engine with additional cooling bolt-ons and a block-mounted non-electric fuel pump. The more powerful [...] "C" [...] code 460 Police Interceptor, with its higher lift camshaft and better flowing heads and exhaust, and high flow in-tank electric fuel pump, as the stock, block-mounted, manual vacuum <b>lift</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> would starve the motor for fuel above 100 mph.|$|R

5000|$|When {{the engine}} {{has to be}} bled because air has {{penetrated}} into the pipes (usually after running out of diesel), it will usually be necessary to bleed the diesel filter: the top vent is unscrewed so as to let excess air escape, while diesel fuel is pumped into the fuel filter with the manual <b>fuel</b> <b>lift</b> <b>pump</b> (just behind the yellow dipstick). The vent can be screwed shut when diesel fuel starts to gush out of it.|$|E
50|$|Every time {{a filter}} is {{disassembled}} or changed, {{it will be}} necessary to bleed it so as to remove excess air, again by opening the top vent so as to let diesel chase all the air (diesel fills up the filter either through gravity -usually the case for the primary filter- or with the help of the <b>fuel</b> <b>lift</b> <b>pump</b> -usually the case for the engine fuel filter-) and diesel starts to gush out. The vent should then be screwed shut.|$|E
50|$|The {{fuel system}} is a very simple design. A {{mechanical}} or electric <b>fuel</b> <b>lift</b> <b>pump</b> feeds a Stanadyne Rotary Distributor Injection pump at low pressure. The distributor injection pump controls both metering, via an internal centrifugal governor, and high pressure fuel delivery to the fuel injectors via internal precision hydraulic pumps. Near {{the top of the}} compression stroke fuel is atomized at high pressure into a hemispherical Inconel prechamber in the cylinder heads using Bosch pintle and seat mechanical fuel injectors. This is called Indirect injection. GM used fully mechanical DB2 series injection pumps on all military HMMWVs and 1982-1993 6.2's and 6.5's. From 1994 till end of production GM used the electronically controlled Stanadyne DS4 series of injection pumps in their light trucks. A mechanical DB4 series injection pump can be found on some 6.5L marine engines.|$|E
40|$|Inertial <b>lift</b> <b>pumps</b> {{function}} adequately {{for both}} purging and sampling of monitoring wells; however, using these devices causes a surging action, which may cause increased turbidity, loss of volatiles, aeration, and degassing of samples. You may use these pumps to collect representative non-sensitive samples; however, {{do not use}} them to collect VOCs or gas-sensitive samples. Operation and Materials The inertial <b>lift</b> <b>pump</b> operates by either moving sample tubing {{up and down in}} a well or by moving a rigid inner pump casing up and down (e. g., TIMCO ® or Water Hand Pump, Brainard•Kilman ® Hand Pump). Both the sample tubing design and the rigid inner pump casing design are equipped with a check valve at the bottom. Figure 18 illustrates both the sample tubing inertial <b>lift</b> <b>pump</b> design and the inner/outer inertial <b>lift</b> <b>pump</b> casing design. An electric or gasoline-powered motor can provide a continuous up and down motion for either design. Manually operating inertial <b>lift</b> <b>pumps</b> can be quite difficult. A rapid up and down motion moves water up these <b>pumps</b> by <b>lift</b> and inertia. A rapid upstroke lifts the water in the tubing or casing. At the end of the upstroke, the water in the tubing or casing continues to move slightly upward by inertia. On the downstroke, the check valve at th...|$|R

5000|$|Practice at the 2009 Isle of Man TT races {{continued}} on Monday 1 June 2009 with a 40-minute delay to reorganise TT Marshals on the Mountain Section of the Snaefell Mountain Course. The German TT newcomer, Rico Penzofer and triple 2008 Manx Grand Prix winner Dan Kneen completed their control-lap {{before the start}} of main evening practice session. The winner of the 2007 Supersport TT Race, Ian Hutchinson pulled in at Ballacraine on the first lap of Monday practice and John McGuinness recorded a lap of 124.35 mph after a broken gear-lever on the high speed Crosby section left his Honda motorcycle jammed in 6th gear. [...] The 2009 Sidecar TT winner Nick Crowe/Mark Cox again failed to record a time on Monday practice after continuing problems with the engine ignition system. The evening practice for Tuesday 2 June 2009 was held in slightly cooler weather conditions and the problems for the first two sessions of glaring sun and flies were reduced for competitors. It was again McGuinness that dominated practice in the Superbike class with a lap of 17 minutes 27.56 seconds an average speed of 129.661 mph. The sidecar TT class was led by Nick Crowe/Mark Cox with a lap of 19 minutes 39.43 seconds an average speed of 114.697 mph. The Suzuki sidecar outfit of Tim Reeves/Patrick Farrance stopped at Keppel Gate on Monday evening practice with a blocked <b>fuel</b> <b>lift</b> <b>pump</b> and then stopped again on Tuesday evening practice at Sulby crossroads with a snapped throttle cable, although completing the lap after borrowing a new cable from a local lawnmower dealer. The American Isle of Man TT newcomer James Vanderhaar slipped-off at Sulby Bridge and Roger Maher hit the bales at Glen Helen. The 600 cc LCR Honda sidecar outfit of David Wallis/Sally Wilson crashed at the 13th Milestone and the crew evacuated by the Medical Helicopter to Nobles Hospital.|$|E

The information of pump operation and installation cost, total lift, energy consumption, operating hour, specific discharge and overall efficiency were studied. The first study was between two suction mode low <b>lift</b> <b>pumps</b> to deliver water from the rainwater storage reservoir to hilltop land. The other comparative study was between (a) pumping water from the reservoir to hilltop using a suction mode low <b>lift</b> <b>pump</b> and (b) pumping water from the aquifer to hilltop using a low capacity force mode pump.|$|R

40|$|The {{increasingly}} {{importance for}} the uses of the air <b>lift</b> <b>pump</b> in widespread list of fields (mining, nuclear industries, agricultural uses, petroleum industries [...] . etc.) makes it very interested for the researchers to find tools to raise the performance outcome of such <b>pumps.</b> An air <b>lift</b> <b>pump</b> system is setup to study {{the effect of the}} suction pipe diameter and submergence ratio on the liquid (water) pumping rate. The system has a lift pipe of (0. 021 m) diameter and (1. 25 m) length. Five diameters for the suction pipe (0. 021, 0. 027, 0. 033, 0. 048 and 0. 063 m) with  a fixed length of (0. 3 m), are tested for each of the submergence ratios (0. 2, 0. 3, 0. 4, 0. 5) respectively.         Results indicate that the higher the diameter of suction pipe is the higher the pumping rate for a fixed submergence ratio. From another side, the higher the submergence ratio is the higher the pumping rate for a fixed suction pipe diameter. Also, under high submergence ratios, high pumping rates are achieved by the use of lower air flow rates compared with those used with lower submergence ratios. The experimental results show good compatibility with the model suggested by Stenning and Martin for the performance of an air <b>lift</b> <b>pump.</b> </p...|$|R

50|$|Most images {{show only}} the engine side, giving no {{information}} on the pumps. Current opinion is that {{at least on the}} early engines, dead-weight force pumps were used, the work of the engine being solely to <b>lift</b> the <b>pump</b> side ready for the next downwards pump stroke. This is the arrangement used for the Dudley Castle replica which effectively works at the original stated rate of 12 strokes per minute/10 gallons (54.6litres) lifted per stroke.

The pipe crossed below the River Crouch at Hullbridge, where shafts were built {{on either side of}} the river, and a tunnel was constructed between them. The water main is formed of twin steel tubes within the tunnel. The engines were normally worked in pairs, and a pair could deliver [...] per day. In August 1927, water from the Chelmer started to be used, and between then and 1945, 96 per cent of the water supplied by Southend Waterworks came from Langford. The wells and boreholes were maintained, to provide a backup supply when necessary.|$|R
