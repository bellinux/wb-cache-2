50|$|The MB-4H {{has been}} {{designed}} to work over varying beach environments and can easily launch and recover inshore lifeboats via a A85 DoDo (drive-on, drive-off) launch cradle/carriage. It will comfortably work at full power into up to 2 m of calm water. The tractor is divided into two sections with the front section housing the power unit, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>oil</b> <b>tank</b> for the front axle, hydraulic pumps, cooling systems and the fuel tank. The rear section houses the rear axle, hydraulic winch with 100 meters of cable, the operator and his/her controls, batteries, electronic control panel, and the drive gear. The driver's seat within the cockpit can face forward or rear, with duplicated controls front and back, allowing the operator flexibility during deployment or retrieval of the DoDo trailer and payload. This allows the combination to drive to the launch site and then reverse round to launch the lifeboat into the sea. The rear-facing controls have the addition of a third foot pedal which is the dead-man control for the winch. The MB-4H has an automatic hydrostatic transmission which gives the tractor an ever-variable ground speed which corresponds to engine speed and ground/sea-bed conditions. To give the tractor excellent handling ability, the vehicle has a pivot steer type with all electrical, mechanical and hydraulic links passing through central wire-reinforced hose. The design allows the tractor to have a steering articulation of 40 degrees to the left or right and results in a turning circle of only ten metres.|$|E

40|$|AbstractElectro-hydrostatic {{actuator}} (EHA) was {{a typical}} power-by-wire (PBW) actuator, which was widely-used in large commercial aircrafts, such as Airbus A 380. The electro-hydrostatic actuator(EHA) had the advantages of small sizes, light weight, high power density, high reliability and maintainability. With the application of EHA in large commercial airplanes, the airworthiness certification of EHA became an new problem. The precondition of the airworthiness certification of EHA was to understand its operating principle and characteristic. Because of no centralized <b>hydraulic</b> <b>oil</b> <b>tank</b> and short cycle oil circuit, the temperature-rise of the hydraulic system in EHA always kept high during operation. Therefore, {{it was important to}} build the thermal-hydraulic models of the hydraulic system in EHA, and to do the thermal analysis of the EHA by this model. In this paper, a lumped-parameter thermal-hydraulic model of the hydraulic part in EHA was proposed. The model was built based on the detailed analysis of the heat transfer of the hydraulic part in EHA. By the simulation of a practical system and the comparison with the traditional hydraulic system, the accuracy and practicality of this model was verified...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The rudder and {{steering}} gear {{is the most}} widely used ship maneuvering equipment. It consists of the maneuvering device, transmission mechanism, steering gear, steering mechanism and the rudder blade. MV "TANSUO HAO " is a scientific research ship of 30 years old. The scientific exploration missions require a very high accuracy of the ship’s course, so the ship has to constantly adjust her course and steer frequently. On that day, the duty officer found the steering gear failure to turn left in the rough sea condition. The engineering crew members had to make an emergency repair. It took plenty of time to locate the trouble of the steering gear in the repair process, because the valve plate deformation problem on the solenoid reversing valve was very hard to find out. By exploring the obscure steering gear failure reason and special troubleshooting process on MV "TANSUO HAO", this thesis provides some repair experience for the hydraulic system management and proposes flexible and patient failure analysis as well as some preventive maintenance measures against the problem.

40|$|This {{report is}} based on the {{challenges}} FMC Technologies has due to measuring the amount of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>oil</b> inside a piston accumulator tank {{on the bottom of the}} sea. It is favorably to know at any given time how much <b>hydraulic</b> <b>oil</b> is left in the tank; in time some of the oil will be lost to the environment due to its function. There are several hydraulic accumulator tanks attached to a subsea Xmas tree, each operating on different system but perform the same main function, which is to send <b>hydraulic</b> <b>oil</b> to an actuator. The actuator uses the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>oil</b> as energy to open and close valves. Today FMC Technologies does not have any satisfying solution regarding this problem; rather they use prior experience of how long it takes before an accumulator tank needs to be refilled. In collaboration with FMC Technologies a solution to the problem has been developed for measuring the remaining <b>hydraulic</b> <b>oil</b> inside the <b>tank,</b> where a measuring system were put on the top of the accumulator tank protected by a housing. The critical issue for the system is an expected lifetime of 25 years. Several solution regarding a measuring system where proposed. A scoreboard criterion where used to distinguish out the best solution according to the requirements given by FMC Technologies. A detailed concept regarding the best solution where developed, which consist of a time-offlight laser placed inside a housing which is attached to the top of the accumulator tank. The housing must be able to withstand water pressure down to 2750 m (275 Bar). The bottom of the housing must be able to withstand internal pressure from the accumulator tank which is 345 Bar. The bottom of the housing also is a second barrier against the water pressure. Hydraulic Accumulator Measuring Unit.
