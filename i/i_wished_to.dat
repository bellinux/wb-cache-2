5|$|Although the {{strictly}} Protestant James <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> end the practice, {{he found}} himself having to touch {{an increasing number of}} people. The practice spread to Scotland, where James reigned as well as resided before the Union of the Crowns; the Scots started believing that their king, now also king of England, possessed the ability to heal them. Charles I (r. 1625–1649) issued plenty of edicts in an attempt to restrain the growing public demand. On 27 December 1633, he touched 100 people at Holyrood Palace.|$|E
5|$|Hervey le Breton (also {{known as}} Hervé le Breton; died 30 August 1131) was a Breton cleric who became Bishop of Bangor in Wales and later Bishop of Ely in England. Appointed to Bangor by King William II of England, when the Normans were {{advancing}} into Wales, Hervey {{was unable to}} remain in his diocese when the Welsh began to drive the Normans back from their recent conquests. Hervey's behaviour towards the Welsh seems to have contributed to his expulsion from his see. Although the new king, Henry <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> translate Hervey to the see of Lisieux in Normandy, it was unsuccessful.|$|E

500|$|The Dream Lord {{describes}} the Doctor sarcastically as [...] "The Oncoming Storm", a name coined by his archenemies the Daleks, and first {{mentioned in the}} Seventh Doctor novel Love and War and subsequently on-screen in [...] "The Parting of the Ways", where it was attributed to the Daleks. He also says to the Doctor, [...] "You're probably a vegetarian!" [...] in a butcher's shop and calls him [...] "veggie", referring to The Two Doctors, in which the Sixth Doctor announced that he and Peri would eat a vegetarian diet from then on. The Dream Lord also teases the Doctor's relationship with Elizabeth I. This began in [...] "The Shakespeare Code" [...] where Elizabeth <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> behead the Doctor and continued in The End of Time, which alluded to the possibility the two were married.

[...] In 1836 he served as an aide to Governor Edward Everett, a position he held until Everett lost the 1839 election. [...] Everett rewarded Clifford for his service by naming him district attorney for the southern district of the state in 1839, a post he held for ten years. [...] He was concurrently elected state senator representing Bristol County in 1845. [...] In 1849 he was appointed state attorney general by Governor George N. Briggs. [...] He was the only major appointed Whig official retained by Democrat George S. Boutwell after he took office in 1851. [...] Boutwell explained in his memoirs that Clifford [...] "was a good officer and an upright man, but he lacked the quality which enables a man to reach conclusions. [...] This peculiarity made him useful to me. He would investigate a subject, give me the authorities and precedents, and leave the conclusions to me. Next, {{there was no one in}} the administration party whom <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> appoint. Mr. [...] Hallett was the candidate most generally supported. He was full of prejudices and he was not well instructed as a lawyer. In these respects Clifford was his opposite." ...|$|E
500|$|Brown's {{most notable}} {{action in the}} House was a speech he made on February4, 1875, in {{response}} to Massachusetts Representative Benjamin F. Butler's call to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1875. Referring to comments Butler had made the previous day about lawlessness against African-Americans in the South, Brown claimed that unjust charges had been made against Southerners by an individual [...] "who is outlawed {{in his own home}} by respectable society, whose name is synonymous with falsehood, who is the champion, and has been on all occasions, of fraud; who is the apologist of thieves, who is such a prodigy of vice and meanness that to describe him would sicken the imagination and exhaust invective." [...] Brown continued by referencing notorious Scottish murderer William Burke, whose method of murdering his victims became known as [...] "Burking." [...] At this point in the speech, Speaker of the House James G. Blaine interrupted Brown, asking if he was referring to a member of the House; Brown gave an ambiguous response before continuing: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> describe all that was pusillanimous in war, inhuman in peace, forbidden in morals, and infamous in politics, I should call it 'Butlerizing'." [...] The House gallery exploded in protest at Brown's remark, and incensed Republican legislators called for Brown's immediate expulsion. Though not expelled, he was officially censured by the House for the use of unparliamentary language. The censure was expunged from the record by a subsequent Congress.|$|E

500|$|While Robinson {{said the}} {{response}} from American critics was largely positive and enthusiastic, Kaes said American critics and audiences were divided: some praised its artistic value and others, particularly those distrustful of Germany following World War <b>I,</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> ban it altogether. Some in the Hollywood film industry felt threatened by the potential rivalry and spoke out against Caligaris release, condemning it as a [...] "foreign invasion". Nevertheless, the film remained popular in the United States. Several American reviewers compared it to an Edgar Allan Poe story, including a 1921 review in Variety magazine, which praised the direction and [...] "perfect tempo" [...] of the film, {{as well as the}} sets that [...] "squeeze and turn and adjust the eye, and through the eye the mentality". A New York Times review likened it to modernist art, comparing the film's sets to Marcel Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2, and said the film [...] "gives dimensions and meaning to shape, making it an active part of the story, instead of merely the conventional and inert background", which was key to the film's [...] "importance as a work of cinematography". Albert Lewin, a critic who eventually became a film director and screenwriter, called Caligari [...] "the only serious picture, exhibited in America so far, that in anything like the same degree has the authentic thrills and shock of art". A story in a November 1921 edition of Exceptional Photoplays, an independent publication issued by the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, said it [...] "occupies the position of unique artistic merit", and said American films in comparison looked like they were made for [...] "a group of defective adults at the nine-year-old level".|$|E

However, Lucy Mack Smith said that she {{and some of her}} children sought comfort in the church after the death of her oldest son, Alvin, in November 1823, which, if her memory was correct, would place the date of the first vision no earlier than 1824. In 1845, Lucy recalled that she tried to persuade her [...] "husband to join with them as <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> do so myself." [...] Her three oldest children Hyrum, Samuel, and Sophronia also joined the Presbyterian church, but [...] "the two Josephs resisted her enthusiasm." [...] D.
