40|$|A {{reduction}} {{in number and}} an increase in size of inflorescences is a common aspect of plant domestication. When maize was domesticated from teosinte, the number and arrangement of ears changed dramatically. Teosinte has long lateral branches that bear multiple small ears at their nodes and tassels at their tips. Maize has much shorter lateral branches that are tipped by a single large ear with no additional ears at the branch nodes. To investigate the genetic basis of this difference in prolificacy (the number of ears on a plant), we performed a genome-wide QTL scan. A large effect QTL for prolificacy (prol 1. 1) was detected on the short arm of chromosome 1 in a location that has previously been shown to influence multiple domestication traits. We fine-mapped prol 1. 1 to a 2. 7 kb "causative region" upstream of the grassy tillers 1 (gt 1) gene, which encodes a homeodomain leucine zipper transcription factor. Tissue in situ hybridizations reveal that the maize allele of prol 1. 1 is associated with up-regulation of gt 1 expression in the nodal plexus. Given that maize does not initiate secondary <b>ear</b> <b>buds,</b> the expression of gt 1 in the nodal plexus in maize may suppress their initiation. Population genetic analyses indicate positive selection on the maize allele of prol 1. 1, causing a partial sweep that fixed the maize allele throughout most of domesticated maize.

40|$|Music and its {{influence}} on stress have been researched extensively (Pelletier, 2004). Specifically, the tempo of music {{has been identified as}} a quality of music with a greater role on impacting the stress response than other components of music (Gomez 2 ̆ 6 Danuser, 2007). An experimental study was conducted in order to assess music tempo’s role in stress reduction, utilizing psychophysiological measures. This study used a convenience sample of African-American undergraduate students from an all-female, Historical Black College in the southeast region of the United States (N = 102). It was hypothesized that participants who were exposed to slower tempo music, rather than the faster tempo music or silence, would have a significantly lower stress level compared to baseline, as assessed through psychophysiological measures of arousal (heart rate and galvanic skin response). One musical piece was utilized: Nuvole Bianche by Ludovico Einaudi, and this piece was manipulated to have a faster and slower tempo. These manipulated versions were used for the slow tempo and fast tempo condition; for the silence condition (control) participants used <b>ear</b> <b>buds.</b> The results indicated that faster tempo music produces a significant increase in participant heart rate, as compared to baseline. Participants in the slow tempo music and the silent condition demonstrated a significant decrease in heart rate. GSR was significantly higher for participants in the fast tempo music and the control conditions. There was no significant change in GSR for participants in the slow tempo condition. This study is important, as it demonstrates music’s ability to influence our physiological experience of stress below our awareness.

40|$|The {{frustration}} {{in the classroom}} was palpable and familiar. We were reading Anne Carson’s translation of Sappho’s poetry, If Not, Winter: Fragments of Sappho, in the first semester of our Honors Civilizations sequence. The students balked at the absence of text, {{the lack of a}} story line, a missing hero, the paucity of biographical information on Sappho, the seeming waste of paper where only one word appeared on a page, and the whole idea of poetry. Poetry was not their thing, some claimed, when asked if this genre appealed to them. Even to honors educators who have the privilege of teaching bright, curious, and engaged students, this assertion is all too familiar. The challenge is to convince students otherwise: to demonstrate pedagogically that poetry can be their thing and also to show them how much it can shape the way they think about the world and their place in it. The funny thing is that, just minutes before the students started complaining about reading Sappho’s poetry, most of them had removed <b>ear</b> <b>buds</b> and turned off any number of electronic devices streaming sound, mostly music. They did not yet see a connection between Sappho’s lyrical poetry and the lyrics of the songs they had just been listening to. Making that connection for them opened the door for critical understandings of Sappho’s work, its evocative imagery, and its ability to give voice to the same deep and confounding feelings of love and desire that the students were experiencing. At the same time, even as students were shown Sappho’s legacy as a lyric poet—for example, the connection between Sappho’s seventh-century BCE “you burn me” (Carson 77) and Peggy Lee’s twentieth-century Fever (Moxley) —they retained a general sense of alienation from the text every time I taught it.

40|$|As the {{structure}} of the music industry changes and arts programs steadily leave public school systems, we as musicians and technicians must collaborate and find a better way to share our craft with new audiences. In order to better market classical music and engender an appreciation by the next generation of audiences, we must better adapt to the on-demand world and develop new ways to capture and process music that, until recently, has been largely appreciated in a live concert setting. More and more, classical music is setting the mood as the anthem in major blockbuster films and being sampled and reused by more contemporary artists as the basis for new music. Recent examples include 2 ̆ 2 Bittersweet Symphony 2 ̆ 2 by The Verve, 2 ̆ 2 Road to Joy 2 ̆ 2 by Bright Eyes, 2 ̆ 2 Ridin 2 ̆ 7 Solo 2 ̆ 2 Jason DeRulo, and many more. New York Times journalist Alex Ross explains this complex relationship saying, 2 ̆ 2 [...] . some of the liveliest reactions to contemporary classical music have come from the pop arena, roughly defined. The microtonal tunics of Sonic Youth, the opulent harmonic designs of Radiohead [...] . All these carry on the long-running conversation of classical and popular traditions 2 ̆ 2 (Ross, 2008, pg. 590). Additionally, pop music contains elements of art song tradition made popular during the romantic era. The same stories being told during that time period are still being told today, just with updated instrumentation and modern language. However, when listening to. classical radio in the car or at home, broadcast quality is often inferior to that of a commercial recording. Furthermore, young people {{are becoming more and more}} likely to listen to music on laptop speakers or cheap <b>ear</b> <b>buds,</b> neither of which is acceptable for enjoying a classical music recording. Much of this transition is attributable to a shift in the view of ownership of music. Many college students own little or no music of their own and turn to streaming services such as Spotify or YouTube when looking to listen to their favorite music. These outlets, especially YouTube, offer a much lower resolution version of the original studio recording that much of the population has come to accept as the standard. Additionally, when music is transferred to mobile devices, quality is again compromised by compression software in an attempt to fit as many files as possible onto a limited amount of memory. The question arises then, what does the label 2 ̆ 2 classical music 2 ̆ 2 mean in our society? What constitutes something as being part of popular music or classical music? James Parakilas explains this in the Journal of Musicology saying, 2 ̆ 2 To be sure, 2 ̆ 2 classical 2 ̆ 2 music is different from 2 ̆ 2 popular 2 ̆ 2 music in crucial and obvious ways, most of it was composed long ago. Audiences, as a result, almost never hear it performed by its composer. Those who perform it and those who discuss it constantly refer to its score. Its audience is by and large elite 2 ̆ 2 (Parakilas, 1984, p. 2). This statement brings to light a problem in our current society. Education of young people to appreciate and support classical music and art is dwindling, causing a rift in the cultural experiences afforded to the next generation. The first step in improving the situation is to make sure that the genre is readily available to anyone that should want to learn about it or experience it for themselves. Pa:rakilas goes on to say: The ways in which listeners become familiar with classical and popular music are likewise balanced. Beethoven 2 ̆ 7 s most fervent devotees do not often listen to one symphony over and over without a break, the way teenagers typically listen to a new rock song. But many people listen to the same Beethoven symphony over and over in the course of their lives. The rock song has one kind of popularity because it is current; the symphony has another kind because it is classic, because it never becomes dated. (Parakilas, 1984, pg. 2) The problem with Parakilas 2 ̆ 7 s rationale is that he does not seem concerned with the difficulty of continuing to have audiences interested in the classics. Classical recordings are, at best, enjoyed by a niche audience of listeners, who also support the music by attending live performances. These patrons of the arts will not be around forever to continue financially supporting the genre and thus there needs to be a heightened importance placed on continuing and revitalizing the history and culture within classical music...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{descriptive}} field {{study was to explore}} music listening habits and preferred listening levels with portable music players (PMPs). We were also interested in seeing whether any exposure differences could be observed between the sexes. Data were collected during 12 hours at Stockholm Central Station, where people passing by were invited to measure their preferred PMP listening level by using a KEMAR manikin. People were also asked to answer a questionnaire about their listening habits. In all, 60 persons (41 men and 19 women) took part in the questionnaire study and 61 preferred PMP levels to be measured. Forty-one of these sound level measurements were valid to be reported after consideration was taken to acceptable measuring conditions. The women (31 years) and the men (33 years) started to use PMPs on a regular basis in their early 20 s. <b>Ear</b> canal headphones/ear <b>buds</b> were the preferred headphone types. Fifty-seven percent of the whole study population used their PMP on a daily basis. The measured LAeq 60 sec levels corrected for free field ranged between 73 and 102 dB, with a mean value of 83 dB. Sound levels for different types of headphones are also presented. The results {{of this study indicate that}} there are two groups of listeners: people who listen less frequently and at lower, safer sound levels, and people with excessive listening habits that may indeed damage their hearing sensory organ in time...|$|R
