40|$|Gland sealing {{has been}} {{researched}} since the 1950 â€™s by the British Hydraulic Research Association and others to improve seal performance. The literature review showed the focus had been on uniform packing compression to more closely match the packing pressure distribution to the fluid pressure {{with the objective of}} reducing leakage over time. There was limited work on the tribology of gland sealing and the patents were dominated by seal designs in a liquor environment. The review identified the particle properties of hardness, shape, fracture toughness and size as relevant to the wear and useful life of a gland seal in a slurry environment. This research presents the design, development and testing of a novel laboratory test rig which deliberately injects slurry particles into a typical standard slurry pump gland seal to cause wear of the sacrificial shaft sleeve. Mineral processing relies on slurry pumping to transfer slurry between plant operations and to improve life cycle costs and reliability in the long term a tribology approach was employed for the research. A range of mineral and synthetic particles were selected over the widest possible hardness range, tested and correlated with the output variable (specific wear rate) of the shaft sleeve. The wear of the shaft sleeve was normalised by travel distance and <b>gland</b> <b>follower</b> load. The data was combined by a novel empirical regression wear model which unified the controlling variables of load, travel distance, particle size, hardness, fracture toughness and size. Recent published values of hardness and fracture toughness were included in the analysis. A linear regression model with interactive terms between the fracture toughness, particle size and hardness, including a log term for the size, provided a good fit with statistical significance to the experimental data. Some dependency was demonstrated between the controlling variables of fracture toughness and particle size. Particle shape was found not to be relevant to the model for particle sizes less than 500 microns. A novel particle shape descriptor weighted dihedral angle which described the average dihedral angle of particle vertices, was proposed and this did not provide any more accuracy than existing descriptors such as SPQ. It was discovered during the experiments that slurry particles may form quasi particles in the seal gap depending on the geometric parameters, gap dimension and material parameters of the opposing (packing) surface, in a semi continuous process. A new tribology qualitative model for the wear of the shaft sleeve and motion of the particles in the gap is described. The relevant particle properties have also been combined into a novel dimensionless number (PDN) which was found to provide a significant correlation with the shaft sleeve SWR, and therefore has the potential to {{serve as the basis for}} future research investigation in three body wear.
