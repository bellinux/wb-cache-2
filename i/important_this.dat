5|$|Preliminary {{studies for}} large destroyers capable of {{defending}} the French battleline against attacks by enemy destroyers and torpedo boats by the Naval General Staff (NGS) began before World War I, but were suspended {{when the war}} began. They resumed in 1917, but serious planning did not begin until after the war when the NGS decided to split {{the role of the}} destroyer in 1919. The smaller torpilleur d'escadre would have the role of attacking the enemy's battleline with torpedoes and defending that of the French from enemy torpedo craft. The primary role of the larger contre-torpilleur was scouting; defending the battleline was secondary and attacking the enemy battleline least <b>important.</b> <b>This</b> required high speed in all weather, good endurance and a powerful armament capable of engaging small cruisers.|$|E

The Avenida dos Descobrimentos and Avenida dos Banhos, in other hand, run parallel to the coast. The growth of the city inland and northwards made ring roads more <b>important,</b> <b>this</b> can be seen in Avenida 25 de Abril, an urban belt road.|$|E
5|$|Vmax is {{only one}} of several {{important}} kinetic parameters. The amount of substrate needed to achieve a given rate of reaction is also <b>important.</b> <b>This</b> is given by the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km), which is the substrate concentration required for an enzyme to reach one-half its maximum reaction rate; generally, each enzyme has a characteristic Km for a given substrate. Another useful constant is kcat, also called the turnover number, which is the number of substrate molecules handled by one active site per second.|$|E

5|$|A large robotic craft arrives {{searching for}} Finn. When Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada) finally {{encounters}} it, Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio) destroys {{it with his}} fist. Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) examines the wreckage and discovers its location of origin; this engenders in Finn a desire to discover the craft's creators. Finn thus resolves to travel across the sea from whence the craft came, but before leaving, he tells Fern (voiced by Hayden Ezzy) to stay and look after Ooo for him. Princess Bubblegum, Marceline (voiced by Olivia Olson) and Fern see Finn, Jake and Susan Strong (voiced by Jackie Buscarino) off on their voyage. Initially, the journey is easy and uneventful, but soon, Finn, Jake, and Susan encounter a sea dragon named Whipple (voiced by Josh Fadem), who {{turns out to be}} rather annoying. BMO (voiced by Niki Yang), who unbeknownst to the others was stowing away on their boat, angrily tells Whipple off, which causes the sea dragon to summon a storm and destroys their boat. This predicament forces Jake to use his magical powers and take on the shape of a boat for the rest to ride. Unfortunately, {{below the surface of the}} water, a species of jellyfish latches onto him, which causes Jake to begin hallucinating. Eventually, after much struggle, Finn and Susan are able to remove them, which causes the hallucinations to end. At this point, Jake complains about wanting to return home, but Finn reveals how <b>important</b> <b>this</b> trip is to him. Whipple overhears Finn's lament and begins to feel sorry for his actions; he then uses his powers to blow the group over the dangerous waters.|$|E
5|$|Van der Goes's is the {{earliest}} extant autographed version, {{and one of}} the most <b>important.</b> <b>This</b> panel was originally a diptych wing of which the accompanying panel of the Virgin and Child is lost, and was probably made for a guild. Luke is dressed in a heavy red robe, draws a preparatory sketch in silverpoint, and wears a melancholy expression. Building on van der Weyden's theme of the role, practice and craft of an artist, van der Goes places pieces of charcoal, a knife and the feathers of a small bird in front of the saint. The similarities to the van der Weyden are many and striking, and include the painting utensils, red robes, physician's cap and blue mantle. The figure has the same middle-aged facial type and his pose, kneeling on a green cushion, although reversed compared to van der Weyden's, is the same. Van der Goes's adaption both increased van der Weyden's standing in the eyes of the later artist's followers, and led to a new group of copies that were modelled on the later painting.|$|E

25|$|On {{the hill}} forming {{the base of}} the El Duende group were erected several stelae {{containing}} toponym glyphs.

The fact that the ElDuende group were originally named after this subterranean water source demonstrates how <b>important</b> <b>this</b> cave was to the ancient inhabitants of DosPilas.|$|E

25|$|The {{first term}} is a {{constant}} contribution to the free energy, and can be ignored. The second term is a finite shift in t. The third term is a quantity that scales to zero at long distances. This means that when analyzing the scaling of t by dimensional analysis, it is the shifted t that is <b>important.</b> <b>This</b> was historically very confusing, because the shift in t at any finite λ is finite, but near the transition t is very small. The fractional change in t is very large, and in units where t is fixed the shift looks infinite.|$|E

Despite {{the fact that many of}} Ibn Babawayh's other works are extremely <b>important,</b> <b>this</b> book is probably the most famous of his extent writings. However, some authorities maintain that there were five major books of traditions that included another of Ibn Babawayh's works, Madinat al-'ilm. Al-Tusi mentions that the latter work was bigger than Man la yahduruhu al-faqih but may no longer exist. Madinat al-'ilm was likely concerned with al-din (the principles of religion) rather than furu, the practical regulations for carrying out the shari'a (Islamic law).|$|E
25|$|Similar to {{physical}} memory, allowing applications {{direct access to}} controller ports and registers can cause the controller to malfunction, or system to crash. With this, depending on {{the complexity of the}} device, some devices can get surprisingly complex to program, and use several different controllers. Because of this, providing a more abstract interface to manage the device is <b>important.</b> <b>This</b> interface is normally done by a Device Driver or Hardware Abstraction Layer. Frequently, applications will require access to these devices. The Kernel must maintain the list of these devices by querying the system for them in some way. This can be done through the BIOS, or through one of the various system buses (such as PCI/PCIE, or USB). When an application requests an operation on a device (Such as displaying a character), the kernel needs to send this request to the current active video driver. The video driver, in turn, needs to carry out this request. This is an example of Inter Process Communication (IPC).|$|E
25|$|Larsson {{began his}} career with Högaborg. A minor club, but also a club, {{which at the time}} was known to have a good {{education}} of young players, and Larsson has ever since he left this club, stressed how <b>important</b> <b>this</b> club has been not only for his football, but also for his adult life in general. In late 1991, he moved to Helsingborg (the main club of his home city), where he soon became the key player. Mats Magnusson did later join his new club, and after 24 seasons in lower tiers, the club returned to Allsvenskan for the 1993 season. Larsson continued there also for this season, but then moved to Feyenoord in November, staying for four years before leaving in 1997. During his time in the Dutch Eredivisie, he finished in third place at the 1994 World Cup with Sweden, alongside players like Martin Dahlin, Tomas Brolin, Jonas Thern, Kennet Andersson and Thomas Ravelli.|$|E

25|$|Loss of delayed {{neutrons}} - In {{order to}} be predictably controlled, nuclear reactors rely on delayed neutrons. They require additional slowly-evolving neutrons from fission product decay to continue the chain reaction. Because the delayed neutrons evolve slowly, this makes the reactor very controllable. In an LFTR, the presence of fission products in the heat exchanger and piping means a portion of these delayed neutrons are also lost. They {{do not participate in}} the core's critical chain reaction, which in turn means the reactor behaves less gently during changes of flow, power, etc. Approximately up to half of the delayed neutrons can be lost. In practice, it means that the heat exchanger must be compact so that the volume outside the core is as small as possible. The more compact (higher power density) the core is, the more <b>important</b> <b>this</b> issue becomes. Having more fuel outside the core in the heat exchangers also means more of the expensive fissile fuel is needed to start the reactor. This makes a fairly compact heat exchanger an important design requirement for an LFTR.|$|E
