40|$|AbstractThe {{effectiveness}} of grinding fluid supply has a crucial impact on grinding quality and efficiency in high speed grinding. In {{order to improve}} the cooling and lubrication, through in-depth research of self-inhaling internal cooling method and intermittent grinding mechanism, a new spray cooling method used in high speed grinding is proposed. By referring {{to the structure of}} bowl-shaped dispersion disk, the grinding wheel matrix with atomization ability is designed; through studying heat transfer of droplet collision and the influence of micro-groove on the boiling heat transfer, <b>grinding</b> <b>segment</b> with micro-groove is designed to enhance the heat flux of coolant and achieve maximum heat transfer between droplets and grinding contact zone. High-speed grinding experiments on GH 4169 with the developed grinding wheel are carried out. The results show that with the micro-groove grinding wheel just 5. 4 % of pump outlet flow rate and 0. 5 % of spindle energy is needed to reduce the grinding temperature to 200 °C, which means the developed grinding wheel makes cooling high efficient and low energy consuming...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper reviews two cooling {{methods for}} surface grinding. These include i) {{replacing}} the toxic coolant by {{a mixture of}} cold air and vegetable oil mist, and ii) minimising the use of coolant using a <b>segmented</b> <b>grinding</b> wheel system. The discussion concludes that the cold air-oil mist provides an environmentally conscious mean for surface grinding. However, due to the limit of its cooling capacity, it is more applicable for fine <b>grinding.</b> Using the <b>segmented</b> wheel system can minimise coolant consumption and can improve grindability...|$|R
50|$|Diamond {{segments}} {{consist of}} small-size diamonds and metal bond materials. The metal bond materials may include the powders of Cu, Sn, Fe, Ag, Co, Ni, WC, Mo, graphite, etc. The diamonds {{are mixed with}} the bond materials, and the mixture is loaded into molds. After hot pressing or cold pressing, sintering, and arc <b>grinding,</b> diamond <b>segments</b> are formed. The metal bond has two basic functions: One is bonding the diamonds {{to the body of}} the tool; the other is wearing along with the diamonds' wearing to let the new sharp diamonds be exposed properly.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{demand for}} extremely-thin Si wafers is expanding. Current {{manufacturing}} technologies are meeting great challenges with the continuous decrease in Si wafer thickness. In this study, a novel single step thinning process for extremely thin Si wafers was {{put forward by}} use of an integrated cup grinding wheel (ICGW) in which diamond <b>segments</b> and chemo-mechanical <b>grinding</b> (CMG) <b>segments</b> are alternately allocated along the wheel periphery. The basic machining principle and key technologies were introduced in detail. Grinding experiments were performed on 8 -in. Si wafers with a developed ICGW to explore the minimal wafer thickness and grinding performance. The experimental {{results indicate that the}} proposed grinding process with the ICGW is an available thinning approach for extremely thin Si wafer down to 15 µm...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. An {{investigation}} is reported {{of the performance}} of diamond impregnated segments in three machining processes- circular sawing of granite with diamond segments, dressing of diamond segments with refractory bricks and surface <b>grinding</b> of diamond <b>segments</b> with an alumina wheel. Two kinds of segments were fabricated by incorporating diamonds (either coated or uncoated) into an iron-based bond matrix. Measurements were made of the horizontal and vertical force components in the machining processes. SEM was used to examine the diamond-matrix bonding states and the ground surfaces of the segments. The changes of forces and segment wear (weight loss and wear performance) were found to be basically consistent for the three machining processes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A new <b>segmented</b> <b>grinding</b> {{wheel of}} the brazed {{monolayer}} diamond was developed with a defined grains pattern on the wheel surface. Results of grinding zirconia using brazed segmented diamond wheel were presented. The experiment {{results showed that the}} grinding forces ratio becomes higher with the increasing of the specific material removal rate and the specific energy falls with the increasing of the maximum undeformed chip thickness during grinding zirconia process. In this investigation, brazed diamond wheels with defined distribution patterns was conditioned by touch-dressing method so that grit tips get micro-conditioned and allow the underlying grits to participate and consequently improve the quality of finish. All the ground surfaces of zirconia were generated by the combined removal modes of brittle and ductile...|$|R
40|$|The {{extraction}} of protruding diamond grains feature from the measured data of grinding wheels {{is the key}} to assessing their surface texture and predicting their functional perfor- mance. The 3 D-motif analysis was utilized to identify the significant features. Based on 6 - neighbourhood and wolf pruning, the tiny and insignificant motifs were eliminated and the surface of <b>grinding</b> wheel was <b>segmented</b> into large significant motifs. Four surface samples of # 600 diamond grinding wheel were measured by using Alicona Infinite Focus Measuring Instrument and analyzed based on 3 D-motif method. As the results shown, the 3 D-motif analysis provided an effective method to segment the measured surface into significant features. The experiments also indicated that wolf pruning at 5 % produced a proper count of the protruding grains extracted from grinding wheel surface...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe surface {{integrity}} of ground workpieces {{is not only}} influenced by the chosen parameters, {{but also by the}} coolant supply. Coolant supply in grinding is mainly governed by the nozzles used and their parameters. However, the cooling efficiency in grinding can also be enhanced by altering the macro-topography of the grinding wheel itself. In this paper three different grinding wheels using the same nozzle parameters are compared with respect to their cooling efficiency and hence their impact on the surface {{integrity of}} the ground workpieces. Besides a standard grinding wheel with continuous layer, a slotted grinding wheel as well as a <b>segmented</b> <b>grinding</b> wheel are presented and their respective cooling efficiency is evaluated. It is shown that by altering the macro-topography of a grinding wheel the resulting surface integrity can be influenced positively as well as negatively...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Industrial & Manufacturing Systems EngineeringZhijian PeiSilicon is {{the primary}} {{semiconductor}} material used to fabricate integrated circuits (ICs). The quality of integrated circuits depends directly {{on the quality of}} silicon wafers. A series of processes are required to manufacture the high-quality silicon wafers. Chemical mechanical polishing is currently used to manufacture the silicon wafers as the final material removal process to meet the ever-increasing demand for flatter wafers and lower prices. A finite element analysis has been conducted to study the effects of influencing factors (including Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the polishing pad, thickness of the pad, and polishing pressure) on the wafer flatness. In addition, an experimental study was carried out on the effects of process variables (including wafer rotation speed, pad rotation speed, the temperature of the cooling wafer in polishing table, polishing pressure, and the slurry flow rate) on material removal rate (MRR) in polishing of silicon wafers. The results from this study show that the polishing pressure and the pad speed are the most significant factors affecting the MRR. The polishing pad {{is one of the most}} critical factors in planarizing the wafer surface. It transports the slurry and interacts with the wafer surface. When the number of polished wafers increases, the pad is glazed and degraded and hence the polishing quality is decreased. The pad properties are changed during the process. The measuring methods for the pad properties including pad thickness monitoring, elastic properties and hardness are reviewed. Elasticity of two types of pads are measured and compared. The poor flatness problems such as tapering, edge effect, concave or convex wafer shape were investigated. Finite element models were developed to illustrate the effects of polishing pad and carrier film properties on the stress and contact pressure distribution on the wafer surface. Moreover, the material removal unevenness is studied. A grinding-based manufacturing method has been investigated experimentally to demonstrate its potential to manufacture flat silicon wafers at a lower cost. It has been demonstrated that the site flatness on the ground wafers (except for a few sites at the wafer center) could meet the stringent specifications for future silicon wafers. One of the problems is the poor flatness at the wafer center: central dimples on ground wafers. A finite element model is developed to illustrate the generation mechanisms of central dimples. Then, effects of influencing factors (including Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the <b>grinding</b> wheel <b>segment,</b> dimensions of the wheel <b>segment,</b> <b>grinding</b> force, and chuck shape) on the central dimple sizes are studied. Pilot experimental results are presented to substantiate the predicted results from the finite element model. This provides practical guidance to eliminate or reduce central dimples on ground wafers. The study in this thesis is to understand the mechanism of CMP and grinding of silicon wafers. Improving the processes and the quality of silicon wafers are the final goals...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. An {{investigation}} is reported {{of the dressing}} of metal-bonded diamond saw blades with four different dressing methods – stirring the blade segments in rock slurries, surface <b>grinding</b> the blade <b>segments</b> with Al 2 O 3 wheels, dressing the blade segments with SiC wheels, and dressing the blades through sawing of refractory materials. The surfaces of dressed blade segments were examined by a scanning electron microscope. The protrusion of the diamond grits on the dressed segments was quantitatively assessed using a digital optical microscope. The vertical and horizontal force components and the spindle power were measured in the refractory sawing. The grit protrusion generated by the stirring method {{was found to be}} the highest and most diamond grits remained their original crystal shapes. But it took a quite long period to let the diamond grits protrude from the bond matrix. The protrusion produced by the surface grinding ranked the lowest among the four methods. The height of grit protrusion for either SiC dressing or refractory sawing was found to be about 20 % of the diamond average size, which might be an optimal point with respect to the segment sawing performance. Force analysis indicated that the force per diamond grit in refractory sawing was much lower than the diamond compressive strength. The changes of spindle power in the sawing of refractory materials can be used to in-process monitor the dressing process...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyThis {{research}} {{aimed to}} develop new cooling methods to replace, or at least minimise, the use of currently used grinding coolants which {{are known to be}} harmful to the environment. The methods used involved the application of a cold air and vegetable oil mist mixture (CAOM), and the use of liquid nitrogen as cooling media. Allied research focused on the development of a <b>segmented</b> <b>grinding</b> wheel equipped with a coolant chamber. The feasibility of a grinding system using CAOM was assessed on the surface grinding of plain carbon steel 1045. It was found that at low material removal rates, ground surfaces were obtained with a quality comparable to that from grinding with a conventional coolant in association with a reduction of grinding forces. There {{was no significant difference in}} the subsurface hardness of the components using CAOM, although the latter method showed a stronger dependence of surface residual stresses on the depth of cut due to the limit in cooling capacity of CAOM. The effects of using liquid nitrogen as a cooling medium on the microstructure of quenchable steel were explored. It was found that a martensite layer was induced on the ground surface. The microstructure featured a dispersion of very fine carbides within the martensite lattice, resulting in a remarkable increase in hardness and high compressive residual stresses within the layer. The topography of the ground surfaces indicated that the material was predominantly removed by brittle fracture. Furthermore surface oxidisation was suppressed. In the interest of coolant minimisation, a segmented wheel equipped with a pressurized coolant chamber was developed. A higher quality ground surface was obtained in conjunction with a coolant saving of up to 70...|$|R
