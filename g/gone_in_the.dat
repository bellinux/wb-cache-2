New York regularly reached the postseason, but were often defeated {{in the first two}} rounds. In 2009, the Yankees opened a new Yankee Stadium and won the World Series for the 27th time in team history, an MLB record.

25|$|This is a Grade II listed {{building}} at Church Street, Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire. The church was originally designed in 1830–32 by Peter Atkinson Junior, {{but only the}} tower of his building remains. Barber rebuilt the rest in 1886–88 in hammer-dressed stone. It has a five-bay nave with buttressed aisles, and the chancel has a further two bays. It has a south porch and a vestry wing to the chancel. The east window has five lights. The tower has three tiers and a south doorway. The tower used to have pinnacles, now <b>gone.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> chancel there is a carved stone reredos of the Last Supper, date unknown. Barber drew earlier plans for this church in 1886, but these were rejected by the client for an unknown reason. No plans now exist for this project.|$|E

Despite numerous chances on both ends of the ice through the first two periods of play, neither team could find the back of the net until the third. With six-and-a-half minutes <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third and Gatineau on the power-play, Jean-Michel Daoust slapped a pass to Guillaume Fournier, who tipped the puck past Rocketes goaltender Kelly Guard for his first of the tournament. Less than four minutes later, however, Kelowna tied the game after a rebound from a Brett Palin slap shot went straight to Randall Gelech, who chipped it in past Gatineau goaltender David Tremblay for his third of the tournament. Kelowna had a chance to take the lead just seconds later, but the shot hit the post.|$|E
25|$|Peru {{contains}} over {{two-thirds of}} all tropical glaciers which provide important water sources for the dry western half of the country. These glaciers are rapidly melting {{as a result of}} climate change, making the flow of rivers more irregular, leading to more droughts and floods. A report by a team from the World Bank published in June 2007 in the bulletin of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) predicts that many of the lower glaciers in the Andes will be <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next decade or so, and that glacial runoff may dry up altogether within 20 years. The last comprehensive satellite survey by Peru's National Environmental Council, carried out in 1997, found that the area covered by glaciers had shrunk by 22% since the early 1960s. Partial surveys by geologists suggest that {{the rate at which the}} glaciers are melting has sped up over the past decade.|$|E

25|$|The British army {{commander}} Sir William Howe {{decided to}} halt his successful campaign at the Delaware River and hold New Jersey {{for the winter}} with 14 garrisons. Howe left Major General James Grant {{in charge of the}} garrisons and returned to New York City. Desiring to pacify the countryside, Grant ordered Brigadier General Alexander Leslie to march to Princeton via Springfield and Bound Brook on 17 December 1776. As Leslie's brigade neared Springfield, it was detected by Spencer's militia which held the town. Sending a courier to Chatham to warn the militia brigade of the British approach, Spencer withdrew his men from Springfield. At Briant's Tavern, Spencer joined the main body of militia and the men advanced to contact the British. With Captain Seeley on the right, Captain Brookfield on the left, Colonel Lindsley on the left center, and Spencer on the right center, the New Jersey militia skirmished with Leslie's brigade near Woodruff's Tavern. The engagement lasted about one hour before darkness fell, upon which the militia withdrew about one mile. During the action Spencer's horse was killed under him. When the militiamen discovered the British were <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning, they were greatly encouraged at their apparent success.|$|E
25|$|After a sixth-minute penalty to the Dragons {{helped them}} up into good field position, Jamie Soward from the ten-metre line kicked {{the ball over}} into the Roosters' in-goal and Mark Gasnier, racing through from the right side, leapt to catch it on the full and put it down just inside the dead ball line. The video referee Bill Harrigan awarded the try and Soward's {{conversion}} was successful, so St. George Illawarra were leading 6-0 after eight minutes. However, video replays showed that in the lead up to the try, Dragons winger Brett Morris had passed the ball with a foot outside the touch-line so play {{should not have been}} allowed to continue. Later, in the sixteenth minute, the Roosters had made their way up into better field position when Todd Carney, twenty metres from the opposition try-line's right side, kicked high to the left corner. His winger Joseph Leilua caught the ball, crashed over the try-line, and while attempting to put it down had it knocked from his outstretched hand by Jamie Soward's knee, but Roosters captain Braith Anasta was there to ground it. The video referee was again called upon to award the try, and with Carney's kick going wide the score was 6-4 in favour of the Red & Whites. Less than two minutes after the restart of play St. George Illawarra knocked on in their own half and the Tricolours, after getting within fifteen metres of the try-line, moved the ball through the hands from {{the left side of the}} field to the right where Mitchell Aubusson crashed over near the corner. Carney again missed the conversion but his side was now in the lead 8-6 with a quarter of the match <b>gone.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> twenty-sixth minute the Dragons were awarded a penalty in a goal-kicking position but Soward missed. At the thirty-minute mark St. George Illawarra prop Michael Weyman was helped off the field after getting a swinging arm to the head from Daniel Conn which was placed on report. The third quarter of the match was played in both ends of the ground with neither side able to turn their opportunities into points, so the teams left the field with the Sydney Roosters leading 6-8.|$|E

The tune did not suit Beyoncé's voice, and Ne-Yo wrote the lyrics from a male perspective, although it was not based upon his personal experiences. Ne-Yo wrote the song in the country style, thinking of country singers Shania Twain and Faith Hill during the sessions. When Ne-Yo heard them playing the song with a guitar, he thought it sounded like country music. But when the drums were incorporated into the music, it was brought to an R vibe, and Ne-Yo considered making an R western music song instead.|$|E

While having been known for his anti-communist rhetoric, Nixon said in 1971 that the U.S. [...] "must have relations with Communist China". His plan was for a slow withdrawal of U.S. troops from Vietnam, while still retaining the government of South Vietnam. The only way he thought this was possible was by improving relations with both Communist China and the USSR. He later made a visit to Moscow to negotiate a treaty on arms control and the Vietnam war, but on Vietnam nothing could be agreed. On his visit to Moscow, Nixon and Brezhnev signed the SALT I, marking the beginning of the [...] "détente" [...] era, which would be proclaimed a [...] "new era of peaceful coexistence" [...] that would replace the hostility that existed during the Cold War.|$|E

[...] There is a long history of adding water to dilute wine {{in order to make it}} more palatable. The ancient Greeks thought it was [...] "barbaric" [...] to drink undiluted wine.

In the leader entitled [...] "The Jewish Peril, a Disturbing Pamphlet: Call for Inquiry", Steed wrote about The Protocols of the Elders of Zion: What are these 'Protocols'? Are they authentic?
