25|$|The Spanish {{referred}} to the people living on the middle St. Johns – the former center of the Utina chiefdom – as the Agua Dulce or Agua Fresca, the Freshwater tribe. Their territory {{was known as the}} Agua Dulce Province. By 1595 Chief Utina appears to have been succeeded, at some remove or another, by the Christian chief Antonico, who ruled from a village also known as Antonico southeast of the old main village. Its precise location is unclear, but <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> have been part of Utina's confederacy if it existed at the time. Most of the northern villages, including the main town, were evidently abandoned, and the number of villages in the chiefdom were reduced to about six, situated between the Palatka area and Lake George. In 1595 the Spanish founded a mission in Antonico village; by 1616 they had founded another, Mission San Antonio de Enacape, in the village of Enacape (perhaps the Mount Royal site near Lake George).|$|E
500|$|Modern {{scientific}} sources {{report that}} the alleged phenomenon is not real. In 1995, Professor Douglas Melton, of the Harvard University Biology department, said, [...] "If you put a frog in boiling water, it won't jump out. It will die. If {{you put it in}} cold water, it will jump before it gets hot—they don't sit still for you." [...] Dr. George R. Zug, curator of reptiles and amphibians at the National Museum of Natural History, also rejected the suggestion, saying that [...] "If a frog had a means of getting out, <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> get out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Essendon did not {{actually}} agree to play the match until {{the night before the}} game; and, ultimately, this [...] "in doubt until the last minute match" [...] was still attended by 16,538 paying spectators (<b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> have been a much larger crowd otherwise).|$|E

5000|$|Kathleen Wiedel from TV Fanatic, gave a 4 {{star rating}} out of 5, stating: [...] "As monster {{of the week}} stories go, this one was {{actually}} rather interesting to me and evoked some potentially intriguing philosophical questions. Though <b>it</b> almost <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> {{have been better if}} someone actually asked the questions." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "To this day, I {{believe there}} was some kind of {{collaboration}} between my lawyer and the prosecution. Riker's [...] Island was supposed to have been built for rehabilitation, but it was the worst place in the world for a kid to try and straighten out his life. I often wonder why I never came out of there a criminal. With all the characters and perverts I met, <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> have been the easy way to go." ...|$|E
2500|$|The church's nave {{would have}} been used for parish worship, regular preaching, {{university}} debates and lectures. Until the completion of a chapel for neighbouring Gonville Hall in 1396, both Michaelhouse and Gonville shared {{in the use of the}} two aisles; Gonville making use of the north aisle of the church, Michaelhouse using the south. Since Gonville Hall was dedicated to the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the north aisle altar was also dedicated to the Blessed Virgin. The south aisle altar was known as that of [...] "St Gregory of Pity", indicating that it {{would have been}} surmounted by an image of the Pity, that is, Christ and the instruments of the Passion. Its association with St Gregory derives from a vision by Pope Gregory the Great when celebrating mass of Christ's real presence and sacrifice in the eucharistic bread. One of the later Hostels of Michaelhouse shared the dedication of the College chapel. While the altarpiece may have survived the reformation, <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> not have survived local Cromwellian iconoclasm, and was most likely destroyed, alongside other images in St Michael's, on Boxing Day 1643. However, a late-medieval scutum sancti Trinitatis (Shield of the Trinity), in the middle ages widely believed to be the Shield of St Michael and probably used as the College's coat of arms, has survived in the chapel's stained glass window.|$|E

5000|$|I hate teaching. You {{do it as}} part of the job. Well, that's {{of course}} false ... or maybe more true than false when I say I hate <b>it.</b> ... But I <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> be just as happy if I had no {{graduate}} students. ... Occasionally there is a graduate student who is a joy to collaborate with. Both David Politzer and Erick Weinberg were of this kind, but they were essentially almost mature physicists. They were very bright by the time they came to me. In general, working with a graduate student is like teaching a course. It's tedious, unpleasant work. A pain in the neck. You do it because you're paid to do it. If I weren't paid to do <b>it</b> I <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> never do <b>it.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] {{said the}} young man, [...] "that {{as she went}} away on foot she must be staying {{with some of the}} neighbors. If we were to make inquiries, <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> not be {{difficult}} to find out where she is." ...|$|E

"It may be psychologically possible," [...] {{answered}} Flambeau, [...] "and <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> explain Dreyfus being {{certain he}} was wronged and his judges being {{sure he was}} guilty.

60|$|And so it {{was that}} her direct {{question}} left him floundering in a sea of embarrassment, for to tell her the truth now would gain him no favor in her eyes, while <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> lay him open to the suspicion and distrust of her father should he learn of it.|$|E
60|$|This kind of {{evidence}} is thought good enough on the negative side. <b>It</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> not be accepted by any sane person for the affirmative side. If what is called psychical research has no other results, at least it enables us to perceive the fallacies which can impose on the credulity of common-sense.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} good, I hope it won't hurt your eyes--will you {{ring the bell}} for some working candles?

60|$|<b>It</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> {{have been}} more {{pleasant}} to all parties concerned, and would not, I think, have compromised their independence in any material degree, if some of these gentlemen had not only yielded to the prejudice in favour of spittoons, but had abandoned themselves, for the moment, even to the conventional absurdity of pocket-handkerchiefs.|$|E
60|$|As {{she drove}} from shop to shop that day, Anne {{reflected}} that <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> not be like Stephen to wear his grandfather's uniform to a ball.

50|$|Although {{the fair}} almost {{certainly}} {{could have been}} ready for 1907, it was postponed {{so as not to}} conflict with the Jamestown Exposition. This turned out to be good fortune for Seattle, because 1907 proved to be a bad year for the economy.

60|$|Madison Clay smiled grimly, {{pushed back}} his chair, rose, dropped a {{perfunctory}} kiss on his daughter's hair, and, taking his shotgun from the corner, departed on a peaceful Samaritan mission to a cow who had dropped a calf {{in the far}} pasture. Inclined as he was to Reuben's wooing from his eligibility as to property, he was conscious that he was sadly deficient in certain qualities inherent in the Clay family. <b>It</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> {{be a kind of}} mesalliance.|$|E
