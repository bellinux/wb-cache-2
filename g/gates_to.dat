5|$|A {{black-and-white}} photo of Adenhart {{along with his}} name and number {{was added to the}} center field fence at Angel Stadium. A makeshift shrine, dedicated to Adenhart, was established outside the home plate <b>gates</b> <b>to</b> Angel Stadium. The makeshift shrine was maintained by Angels personnel until its removal in December 2009. The Angels do not have any plans to create a permanent memorial.|$|E
5|$|The city of Bari, {{which had}} been {{the capital of the}} Byzantine Catapanate of Southern Italy for centuries before the arrival of the Normans, opened its <b>gates</b> <b>to</b> the Emperor's army, and the overjoyed {{citizens}} tore down the Norman citadel. After the fall of Bari, the cities of Trani, Giovinazzo, Andria, Taranto, and Brindisi were also captured. William arrived with his army, including 2,000 knights, but was heavily defeated.|$|E
5|$|The {{town council}} has its {{headquarters}} and meeting place at Riggs Hall, {{which is one}} of the original buildings of the former site of Shrewsbury School on Castle <b>Gates</b> (<b>to</b> the rear of the town's main library). This has been its home since 2017; it was previously at the Guildhall, on Frankwell Quay, which had originally been built in 2004 as the headquarters of Shrewsbury and Atcham Borough Council, but is now a building used by the University Centre.|$|E

There are four <b>gates</b> nearby leading <b>to</b> each of the four winds, each guarded by a warden archon. The {{guardian}} of the <b>gate</b> <b>to</b> the North Wind is Yonel, the guardian of the <b>gate</b> <b>to</b> the South Wind is Kerkhoutha, the guardian of the <b>gate</b> <b>to</b> the West Wind is Moriel, and the guardian of the <b>gate</b> <b>to</b> the East Wind is Ruhiel.|$|R

Indonesia has an embassy in Bucharest and Romania has an embassy in Jakarta.|$|R
5|$|The tube station {{became one}} of the {{principal}} shelters during the Blitz. Following heavy raids on the East End on 7 September 1940, many sought refuge underground, and staff opened the <b>gates</b> <b>to</b> everyone at Liverpool Street without asking for tickets. Though technically illegal, it remained the most practical and safe shelter for local residents.|$|E
5|$|A {{large area}} of the grounds between the asylum main {{buildings}} and Princess Street was allocated to Children's Cottages in 1885. When the Children's Cottages became a separate institution, the area surrounding the cottages became no longer under asylum management and was no longer for asylum inmate use. Widening and straightening of Princess Street in 1939-1940 resulted in the demolishing of Kew's gatehouses, loss of land and the relocation of the main <b>gates</b> <b>to</b> Victoria Park, Kew. Construction of Yarra Boulevard during the 1930s led to {{a section of the}} asylum's river frontage being acquired by the roads department.|$|E
5|$|Although the College {{building}} was saved from the war, its walls and roof {{were left in}} a perilous state. In 1954 a decision was forced upon heralds, whether to abandon the old building (which would have been profitable financially) or repair it on a scale far beyond the College's resources. Eventually {{with the help of}} the Ministry of Works and a public subscription, the {{building was}} repaired in time for the College's 4th centenary of being in possession of Derby Place. The present <b>gates</b> <b>to</b> the building were added in 1956, and came originally from Goodrich Court in Herefordshire. The new gates displayed the College's arms and crest.|$|E

5|$|American's service {{peaked in}} 1992 with 265 daily departures, after which flights were {{gradually}} scaled back until the hub eventually closed in 1995. American cited {{the aftermath of}} the early 1990s recession and the lack of local passengers as reasons for the closure. As American scaled down its operations, it subleased its <b>gates</b> <b>to</b> other carriers, largely in order to cover the debt used to construct the hub facilities, which American had guaranteed. Southwest Airlines quickly filled the void by seizing 54% of the Nashville market and making it a focus city, with American remaining as the second-largest carrier at Nashville, followed by Delta Air Lines.|$|E
5|$|At the {{approach}} {{to the west of}} the important city of Augusta Taurinorum (Turin, Italy), Constantine met a large force of heavily armed Maxentian cavalry. In the ensuing battle Constantine's army encircled Maxentius' cavalry, flanked them with his own cavalry, and dismounted them with blows from his soldiers' iron-tipped clubs. Constantine's armies emerged victorious. Turin refused to give refuge to Maxentius' retreating forces, opening its <b>gates</b> <b>to</b> Constantine instead. Other cities of the north Italian plain sent Constantine embassies of congratulation for his victory. He moved on to Milan, where he was met with open gates and jubilant rejoicing. Constantine rested his army in Milan until mid-summer 312AD, when he moved on to Brixia (Brescia).|$|E
5|$|Concourse D was {{constructed}} as a ground level commuter terminal for American Eagle with 15 ground level commuter aircraft parking spots and gate facilities. All American Eagle flights operated out of Concourse D until, as a cost-cutting measure after 9/11, all American Eagle flights {{were moved to}} Concourse C to share gates with American Airlines. For {{a short period of}} time, Concourse D was used by Corporate Airlines to operate its own regional flights until it became a regional affiliate with American Connection and Continental Connection, at which point the concourse was closed by the MNAA. Currently, plans exist to expand Concourse D with additional <b>gates</b> <b>to</b> increase capacity and attract new airlines, as well as provide new retail and dining offerings.|$|E
50|$|El Arco de los Blancos is the <b>gate</b> <b>to</b> the Populo district, {{built around}} 1300. It was the {{principal}} <b>gate</b> <b>to</b> the medieval town. The gate is named after the family of Felipe Blanco who built a chapel (now disappeared) above the gate.|$|R
50|$|A TVS can be {{measured}} by intense <b>gate</b> <b>to</b> <b>gate</b> wind shear, which is the change of wind speed and/or direction across the two gates of inbound and outbound velocities. Gates are the individual pixels on the radar display. For example, if the inbound velocity is -48 kn knots and the outbound is 39 kn, then there is 87 kn of <b>gate</b> <b>to</b> <b>gate</b> shear. The impressiveness of a TVS not only {{has to do with}} the strength of the <b>gate</b> <b>to</b> <b>gate</b> shear, but it also incorporates the size and depth of the TVS, and the strength of any surrounding mesocyclone, among other factors.|$|R

5|$|Control of {{the canal}} passed into public {{ownership}} with the Transport Act 1947. Despite concerted efforts, the Conservators could not make any progress with {{the removal of the}} fixed low-level bridges, which prevented maintenance from being carried out. The Inland Waterways Association started to take an active interest in the restoration {{of the canal}} from 1952, but this was resisted by the British Transport Commission, who padlocked the lock <b>gates</b> <b>to</b> prevent them being used. Despite this, a team of seven men was employed to maintain the infrastructure through this period. The maintenance of the channel enabled the canal {{to become one of the}} first to be used for the commercial transport of water, which was pumped from the canal to Durleigh reservoir from 1962 onwards.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in Lough Mask before the {{controversy}} began, Boycott had become unpopular with the tenants. He had become a magistrate and was an Englishman, which {{may have contributed to}} his unpopularity, but according to Marlow it was due more to his personal temperament. While Boycott himself maintained that he was on good terms with his tenants, they said that he had laid down many petty restrictions, such as not allowing <b>gates</b> <b>to</b> be left open and not allowing hens to trespass on his property, and that he fined anyone who transgressed these restrictions. He had also withdrawn privileges from the tenants, such as collecting wood from the estate. In August 1880, his labourers went on strike in a dispute over a wage increase.|$|E
5|$|From 1911 to 1921, the northâ€“south {{section of}} modern NY251 near Scottsville {{was part of}} Route15, an {{unsigned}} legislative route assigned by the New York State Legislature. The first portion {{of what is now}} NY251 to receive a posted designation was the segment east of NY64 in Mendon, which was part of the signed NY15 from 1924 to 1930. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY251 was assigned to an alignment extending from <b>Gates</b> <b>to</b> Victor via Scottsville, utilizing modern NY386 north of Scottsville and its current alignment east of the village. NY251 was truncated to begin at NY383 in Scottsville on July 1, 1977, at which time the former routing of NY251 between Scottsville and Gates became part of an extended NY386.|$|E

25|$|Two {{the west}} the line split northwards and southwards after running west along Karl Johans gate. The {{southern}} route, the Vestbanen Line, followed Rosenkrantz' <b>gate</b> <b>to</b> Oslo West Station, through Engens <b>gate</b> <b>to</b> Munkedamsveien. It ran along it <b>to</b> Cort Adlers <b>gate,</b> Huitfeldts gate and Larssons <b>gate</b> <b>to</b> Parkveien. From there it followed Munkedamsveien to Skillebekk, where it connected to KES's SkÃ¸yen Line. North from Karl Johans gate the Homansbyen Line (today the UllevÃ¥l Line) ran along Hedgehaugsveien, Pilestredet and Thereses <b>gate</b> <b>to</b> Adamstuen. Sagene Ring {{took off from}} AthenÃ¦um in Akersgata and ran northwards along Colletts gate, Geitemyrsveien and Kierschouws gate through the neighborhoods of St. Hanshaugen and Sagene. From there it ran across Bentse Bridge {{to connect with the}} GrÃ¼nerlÃ¸kkaâ€“Torshov Line at Torshov.|$|R
5000|$|Tarsus was {{enclosed}} {{by a pair}} of concentric defense walls [...] According to 17th century-Turkish traveler Evliya Ã‡elebi, there were three gates; a mountain <b>gate</b> <b>to</b> Toros Mountains in the north, a port <b>gate</b> <b>to</b> the Mediterranean coastline in the south and the Adana <b>Gate</b> <b>to</b> the neighbouring city of Adana in the east. In 1835, the walls were demolished by Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt, following the Egyptian-Ottoman War of 1831-1833. Only the port <b>gate</b> survived up <b>to</b> the present time, albeit because of alluvial deposits from the rivers Berdan and Seyhan, the coastline is currently 15 km south of the port gate.|$|R
5|$|General de Kalb's forces took {{almost a}} month to descend the Chesapeake Bay and did not arrive in Petersburg, Virginia {{until the middle of}} June, {{almost a month}} after Lincoln had {{surrendered}} his army. The Continental Congress appointed Horatio <b>Gates</b> <b>to</b> command the Southern Department. He assumed command on July 25, 1780 and immediately marched into South Carolina with the intent of engaging the British Army, now under the command of Charles Cornwallis. Williams served as Deputy Adjutant-General under Gates.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} Nur ad-Din's {{death in}} 1174, Damascus {{was seized by}} Saladin, the Ayyubid sultan of Egypt. In that year, Saladin rode from Egypt past the Crusader states to Damascus with only 700 horsemen. The city opened its <b>gates</b> <b>to</b> Saladin without resistance, except for the citadel, which surrendered to him later that year. Saladin added a tower to the citadel and refurbished the residential buildings. Like his predecessor Nur ad-Din, Saladin died of an illness in the citadel on 4 March 1193. He was initially buried inside the citadel, but later reburied in a mausoleum near the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus.|$|E
5|$|In February 1082, Dyrrhachium fell after a Venetian or Amalfian citizen {{opened the}} <b>gates</b> <b>to</b> the Normans. The Norman army {{proceeded}} to take most of northern Greece without facing much resistance. While Guiscard was in Kastoria, messengers arrived from Italy, bearing news that Apulia, Calabria, and Campania were in revolt. He {{also learned that}} the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry IV, was {{at the gates of}} Rome and besieging Pope Gregory VII, a Norman ally. Alexios had negotiated with Henry and given him 360,000 gold pieces in return for an alliance. Henry responded by invading Italy and attacking the Pope. Guiscard rushed to Italy, leaving Bohemond in command of the army in Greece.|$|E

5|$|In autumn 1080, Melissenos left Kos and {{returned}} to Asia Minor. There, he succeeded in gaining {{the support of the}} local population, and in recruiting many Turkish tribesmen as mercenaries to his army. One by one, the cities of western and central Asia Minor opened up their <b>gates</b> <b>to</b> him, and Turkish garrisons were installed in them. Botaneiates tried to send Alexios Komnenos, who had recently suppressed the revolts of Nikephoros Bryennios and Nikephoros Basilakes, against him, but he refused. In February 1081, Melissenos's troops took Nicaea, where he was acclaimed as emperor, and defeated a loyalist army under the eunuch John.|$|E
5|$|Meir Ben-Dov {{believed}} that the Acra stood {{just south of the}} Huldah Gates of the southern wall of the Herodian Temple Mount platform. Benjamin Mazar's excavations of the Ophel, the area adjoining the southern portion of the platform, have unearthed the foundations of a massive structure and a large cistern, both possibly dating to the Hellenistic period. These have been tentatively identified as remnants of the Acra, with the structure, featuring rows of small interconnected rooms, believed to be the remains of a barracks. These had been demolished and built over during the Hasmonean period, matching the descriptions in Josephus. The Hasmonean constructions were, in turn, flattened to create a public square fronting the main <b>gates</b> <b>to</b> the Temple platform during the Herodian renovations.|$|E
5|$|Petersham Gate {{served the}} Russell School, {{replacing}} the more ornate <b>gates</b> <b>to</b> Petersham Lodge. A disused carriage gate further {{up the hill}} was probably a tradesman's entrance to the school or to the Lodge stables. Bishop's Gate in Chisholm Road, previously known as the Cattle Gate, was for use by livestock allowed to pasture in the nineteenth century. It was opened for public use in 1896. Kitchen Garden Gate, hidden behind Teck Plantation, is probably a nineteenth-century gate. It has never been open to the public. Cambrian Gate or Cambrian Road Gate was constructed during World War I {{for access to the}} newly built South Africa Military Hospital. When the hospital was demolished in 1925, the entrance was made permanent and public as a pedestrian gate.|$|E
