Zero-motion-based H. 264 means that only the previous frame is used as the referenced frame for the <b>inter-coding</b> with motion searching region set to zero, which is therefore similar to the differential pulse coding modulation (DPCM). Because DPCM exploits the temporal correlation between adjacent frames, zero-motion-based H. 264 normally outperforms the intra-frame coding in term of rate-distortion performance. With no motion estimation at the encoder, its encoding process is greatly simplified.

Each block can be coded either from the V1 or from the V4 codebook. When coding from the V1 codebook, one codebook index per 4×4 block is written to the bitstream, and the corresponding 2×2 codebook entry is upscaled to 4×4 pixels. When coding from the V4 codebook, four codebook indices per 4×4 block are written to the bitstream, one for each 2×2 subblock. Alternatively to coding from the V1 or the V4 codebook, a 4×4 block in an <b>inter-coded</b> image can be skipped. A skipped block is copied unchanged from the previous frame in a conditional replenishment fashion. The data rate can be controlled by adjusting the rate of key frames and by adjusting the permitted error in each block.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{multicarrier}} {{code division}} multiple access (MC-CDMA), a good bit error rate (BER) performance can be achieved by using frequency-domain equalization (FDE) based on the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. However, the presence of residual <b>inter-code</b> interference (ICI) after MMSE-FDE and despreading degrades the BER performance of the multi-code MC-CDMA. The use of ICI cancellation can improve the BER performance of the multi-code MC-CDMA. To further improve the BER performance, transmit diversity technique is effective. In this paper, cyclic delay transmit diversity (CDTD) is considered. CDTD can achieve the frequency diversity gain, whereas the well-known space-time transmit diversity (STTD) can achieve the antenna diversity gain owing to the space-time coding and provide a better BER performance than CDTD. It is shown in this paper that the performance degradation of CDTD is mainly due to the residual ICI after MMSE-FDE. In order to achieve a good BER performance, the multi-code MC-CDMA using joint CDTD and ICI cancellation is proposed, and its BER performance is evaluated by computer simulation.

This work proposes an algorithm to optimally estimate the overall distortion of decoder frame reconstruction due to quantization, error propagation, and error concealment. The method recursively computes the total decoder distortion at pixel level precision to accurately account for spatial and temporal error propagation. The accuracy of the estimate is demonstrated via simulation results. The estimate is integrated into a rate-distortion (RD) -based framework for optimal switching between intra-coding and <b>inter-coding</b> modes per macroblock. The cost in computational complexity is modest. The framework is further extended to optimally exploit feedback/acknowledgment information from the receiver/network.

Due to dynamic nature of scene complexity and variations in videos, SAD variations using McFIS against a current frame are least compared to that of using the immediate previous frame as McFIS does not contain moving objects. Thus, McFIS would be better choice for SCD compared to the immediate previous frame. We do not need any ME (unlike Ding’s algorithm) for the current frame before taking intra/inter-frame decision. Obviously, we need computation to generate the McFIS, but this can be paid off by avoiding ME time in AGOP determination as for Ding’s algorithm.

Intuitively, {{this will}} result in bandwidth inefficiency if the receiver uses a low bit-depth display device, {{especially in the case}} where a small GOP size is adopted and the data in the I-frames dominate the bitstream. To improve the coding efficiency in such situations, we combine the HL scheme with the LH scheme to form a hybrid LH-HL scheme in which the intra-MBs and inter-MBs are encoded by the LH scheme and the HL scheme, respectively.
