[...] The characteristic features of dissociative anesthesia {{were described as}} catalepsy, amnesia and analgesia. [...] According to Pender (1972), [...] "the state has been designated as dissociative anesthesia since the patient truly seems disassociated from his environment." [...] Bonta (2004) described <b>dissociative</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> as [...] "... a peculiar anaesthetic state in which marked sensory loss and analgesia as well as amnesia is not accompanied by actual loss of consciousness." [...] Both Pender (1970) and Johnstone et al. (1959) reported that patients under anaesthesia due to either ketamine or phencyclidine were prone to purposeless movements and had hallucinations (or [...] "dreams") during and after anaesthesia. Some patients found the hallucinations euphoric while others found them disturbing.|$|E
40|$|The overall {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to study the effects of different drug combinations for premedication and <b>dissociative</b> <b>anaesthesia,</b> to examine their suitability for field conditions and their ability to maintain cardiorespiratory function and provide sufficient analgesia for common, but challenging procedures such as castration. Haemodynamic parameters, pulmonary ventilation-perfusion relationships, and clinical effects were studied during sedation and <b>dissociative</b> <b>anaesthesia.</b> The effects of additional premedication and prolongation of <b>dissociative</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> and response to surgery were evaluated. The cardiorespiratory effects of romifidine and tiletamine-zolazepam anaesthesia did not differ significantly from those of prolonged romifidine and ketamine anaesthesia. Prolongation of anaesthesia with ketamine alone after romifidine/ketamine resulted in a poor quality of anaesthesia. There was a decrease in arterial oxygenation during sedation with a 2 -agonists, which was mainly attributed to a reduced cardiac output and increased ventilation-perfusion mismatch. During <b>dissociative</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> the cardiac output did normalise, but arterial oxygenation was further impaired as a result of increased intrapulmonary shunt and increased ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Administration of acepromazine before sedation with romifidine and butorphanol resulted in better maintenance of circulation and partly prevented the anaesthesia-induced ventilation-perfusion disturbances and fall in arterial oxygen tension. Although the arterial oxygenation was further impaired during anaesthesia and recumbency compared to that during sedation, the oxygen delivery did not decrease further. On the contrary, the arterial-mixed venous oxygen content difference and mixed venous oxygen tension remained closer to standing unsedated values during anaesthesia than in the sedated horse. Breathing high oxygen concentrations (> 95 % oxygen) during <b>dissociative</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> improved arterial oxygenation compared to air breathing (21 % oxygen), but concomitantly increased intrapulmonary shunt and introduced hypoventilation. The intrapulmonary shunt created during anaesthesia with high oxygen concentrations persisted when the horses returned to air breathing, possibly indicating that resorption atelectasis produced during high oxygen breathing subsequently persisted during anaesthesia and recumbency. Tiletamine-zolazepam anaesthesia, after premedication with acepromazine, romifidine and butorphanol, produced anaesthesia and analgesia sufficient for castration of colts under field conditions. When the same regimen was used in the animal hospital there was a need for supplementary anaesthesia in some cases to complete surgery. The induction, anaesthesia and recovery were calm and without excitation in all colts both under hospital and field conditions. Cardiorespiratory changes during air breathing were within acceptable limits in these clinically healthy horses...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. It is {{important}} to know which clinical situations prevent ketamine from working. Case Report. We present the case of the psychiatric inpatient who was admitted to our emergency department after ingesting a toxic dose of lamotrigine, unknown at that time. On admission, she was clearly in distress, displaying extreme agitation and violent ataxic movements. We opted to achieve sedation using intravenous ketamine boluses. Unexpectedly, after being injected with a total of 250 [*]mg ketamine, our patient displayed no signs of <b>dissociative</b> <b>anaesthesia.</b> Discussion. There was no apparent reason for why ketamine failed, but an interaction between lamotrigine and ketamine was suspected. A literature search was performed. Very few articles describe interactions between lamotrigine and ketamine. Experimental studies, however, demonstrate how lamotrigine attenuates the neuropsychiatric effects of ketamine. Ketamine is classically described as an NMDA antagonist. Ketamine’s dissociative effects, however, are thought to be mediated by increased glutamate release via a pathway not dependent on NMDA receptors. Lamotrigine, on the other hand, is known to reduce cortical glutamate release. Conclusion. Lamotrigine reduces the glutamate release needed to mediate ketamine’s <b>dissociative</b> <b>anaesthesia.</b> This {{is important}} knowledge for anaesthesiologists in the emergency room where ketamine is often administered to unstable patients...|$|E

40|$|The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate <b>dissociative</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> for castration of colts during field conditions. Three dissociative anaesthetic protocols were evaluated during castration of colts in an animal hospital. The protocol considered to be the most suitable was thereafter evaluated during castration of colts under field conditions. Respiratory and haemodynamic parameters and the response to surgery were determined during anaesthesia. All horses breathed air spontaneously during anaesthesia. Under hospital conditions 26 colts were randomised to receive one of three anaesthetic protocols: Romifidine and tiletamine-zolazepam (RZ); acepromazine, romifidine and tiletamine-zolazepam (ARZ); or acepromazine, romifidine, butorphanol and tiletamine-zolazepam (ARBZ). The surgeon was blinded to the anaesthetic protocol used and decided whether supplemental anaesthesia was needed to complete surgery. Under field conditions 31 colts were castrated during anaesthesia with the ARBZ protocol. All inductions, anaesthesia and recoveries were calm and without excitation under both hospital and field conditions. Surgery was performed within 5 – 20 minutes after the horses had assumed lateral recumbency during both hospital and field castrations. Under hospital conditions some horses needed supplemental anaesthesia with all three anaesthetic protocols to complete surgery. Interestingly, none of the horses castrated with protocol ARBZ under field conditions needed additional anaesthesia. Cardiorespiratory changes were within acceptable limits in these clinically healthy colts. </p...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} use of low dose {{intramuscular}} ketamine with high dose intranasal midazolam in children before suturing. METHODS: Altogether 102 children with simple wounds between 1 and 7 years old were allocated to the two study groups. RESULTS: Two children {{were excluded from the}} study because of deviation from the agreed protocol. The 50 children in the ketamine group were less likely to cry or need to be restrained during the procedure than those in the midazolam group (p < 0. 01). The median oxygen saturation was 97 % in both groups. There was no difference in the recovery behaviour and the range of time at which children were ready for discharge, although the median time for the latter was shorter in the midazolam group (75 v 82 minutes). Vomiting occurred in nine of the ketamine and four of the midazolam group. After discharge both groups had an unsteady gait (73 % v 71 %) which usually resolved within two hours. CONCLUSION: Intranasal midazolam (0. 5 mg/kg) effectively sedated the children in that none could remember the suturing. However a significant number still had to be restrained (86 % v 14 %). Intramuscular ketamine (2. 5 mg/kg) produced <b>dissociative</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> in the majority of cases and was the preferred drug of nurse, doctor, and parent...|$|E

The mean induction dose of ketamine hydrochloride was 7. 99 ± 1. 99 mg kg- 1 (mean±SD) and that of diazepam was 0. 05 ± 0. 01 mg kg- 1. The mean induction time was 23. 07 ± 17. 63 min and the mean duration of immobilisation was 127. 00 ± 20. 72 min. Six of the 22 seals apomorphine hydrochloride vomited and the seal given tincture of ipecac did not vomit. The mean dose of apomorphine hydrochloride that produced vomiting in immobilised animals was 0. 18 ± 0. 10 mg kg- 1 and the mean dose of apomorphine hydrochloride that produced vomiting in non-immobilised animals was 0. 22 ± 0. 15 mg kg- 1.

40|$|During {{anaesthesia}} electrocortical {{activity as}} observed {{by the human}} electroencephalogram (EEG) is subject {{to a host of}} quantitative changes which coincide with the selective actions of anaesthetic agents at gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibitory synapses. Through potentiation of GABAA receptor based inhibitory currents, inhaled volatile anaesthetics shift the EEG through a range of states yet to be fully understood, resulting in a large amplitude and low frequency EEG signal. Paradoxically, one class of anaesthetics/analgesics know as dissociative agents, target excitatory N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, impeding their function and producing EEG patterns similar to alert and aroused states. Consequently, dissociative anaesthetics, especially the commonly used nitrous oxide (N 2 O) fail to be characterised by clinical EEG monitors of anaesthetic depth. To date, the effects of N 2 O on the EEG have yet to be adequately characterised, even though it has received extensive medical use for well over 100 years. The following investigation sought to clearly quantify the effects of N 2 O on the EEG in healthy male participants. It was found that during N 2 O inhalation the EEG underwent broadband attenuation but otherwise remained spectrally similar to resting EEG. Conversely, during the withdrawal of N 2 O, the EEG showed a strong rebound effect which produced large amplitude delta/theta oscillations, more typically associated with sedation and anaesthesia. The combination of these effects may help explain previously reported difficulties in attempting to monitor patient state with the EEG during anaesthesia involving N 2 O. Given the invariance of several standard linear measures, nonlinear analysis of the EEG was employed to investigate any higher order effects of N 2 O. However, a multivariate method showed nonlinearity of the EEG to be marginally altered by N 2 O. In general a central limiting factor was the insufficient number of participants administered higher concentrations of N 2 O, due to attrition. In light of previous theoretical attempts to simulate the EEG during anaesthesia, N 2 O is inferred to chiefly target cell populations that interact via NMDA synapses, which contribute less to the periodicity of the EEG. Contrasting this action with the standard GABAA based anaesthetics, where interacting inhibitory populations thought to be crucial in resting EEG rhythmogenesis are perturbed. These findings will assist in future attempts at monitoring <b>dissociative</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> and more generally contribute to understanding the brain dynamics associated with the NMDA receptor system...|$|E
