The mathematical formulation of this question involves the Dirichlet eigenvalues of the Laplace equation in the plane, that represent the fundamental modes of vibration in direct analogy with the integers that represent the fundamental modes of vibration of the violin string.|$|E

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of MathematicsZongzhu LinThe Weyl algebra is the algebra of <b>differential</b> <b>operators</b> on a {{commutative}} ring of polynomials in finitely many variables. In Hayashi 1990, Hayashi defines an algebra {{which he}} refers to as the quantized n-th Weyl algebra given by a deformation of the classical Weyl algebra. In luntsdifferential, Lunts and Rosenberg define [beta] and quantum <b>differential</b> <b>operators</b> for localization of quantum groups by deforming the relations that algebras of <b>differential</b> <b>operators</b> satisfy. In Iyer 2007, Iyer and Mccune compute the quantum <b>differential</b> <b>operators</b> on the polynomial algebra with n variables. One naturally wonders ``What is the relationship between the quantized Weyl algebra and the quantum <b>differential</b> <b>operators</b> on the polynomial algebra with n variables?" In this thesis we answer this question by comparing the natural representations of U[subscript]q(sl[subscript] 2) emerging from each algebra. Additionally, we connect the <b>differential</b> <b>operators</b> on the big cell of the flag variety of U[subscript]q(sl[subscript]n) with our deformed algebras.

25|$|In {{a series}} of papers with several authors, Atiyah {{classified}} all instantons on 4-dimensional Euclidean space. It is more convenient to classify instantons on a sphere as this is compact, and this is essentially equivalent to classifying instantons on Euclidean space as this is conformally equivalent to a sphere and the equations for instantons are conformally invariant. With Hitchin and Singer he calculated the dimension of the moduli space of irreducible self-dual connections (instantons) for any principal bundle over a compact 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold (the Atiyah–Hitchin–Singer theorem). For example, the dimension of the space of SU2 instantons of rank k>0 is 8k−3. To do this they used the Atiyah–Singer index theorem to calculate the dimension of the tangent space of the moduli space at a point; the tangent space is essentially the space of solutions of an elliptic <b>differential</b> <b>operator,</b> given by the linearization of the non-linear Yang–Mills equations.
