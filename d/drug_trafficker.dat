5|$|The {{death of}} Ramírez Treviño's boss {{triggered}} a war within the Gulf Cartel, {{resulting in the}} deaths and arrests of several high-ranking drug traffickers from 2011 to 2013. When the Gulf Cartel's top leaders Mario Cárdenas Guillén and Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez were arrested in early September 2012, Ramírez Treviño decided to step up for the job and become the undisputed leader of the cartel. In efforts to keep the Gulf Cartel under a single command structure, he ordered the assassination of high-ranking <b>drug</b> <b>trafficker</b> El Metro 4 on 15 January 2013 in Reynosa. His death, however, sparked a turf war.|$|E
5|$|A {{plea for}} a review by the Constitutional Tribunal was sought as a last-ditch attempt {{to stave off the}} {{execution}} of <b>drug</b> <b>trafficker</b> Shanmugam Murugesu. Shanmugam's lawyer contended that his client's right to equal protection under Article 12 of the Constitution had been infringed. Referring to cases of six recent offenders similarly convicted under the Misuse of Drugs Act, Shanmugam's lawyer drew {{attention to the fact that}} those offenders had imported more than 700grammes of cannabis, an offence which attracted the death penalty, but were eventually charged with possessing less than 500grammes of cannabis which resulted only in a jail sentence. In contrast, Shanmugam, who had imported 1,029.8grammes of cannabis, did not have the amount reduced and was sentenced to death. The plea was rejected by the President on 12 May 2005, one day before the execution date.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{builds on}} recent {{scholarships}} that have highlighted {{the gap in}} empirical knowledge on <b>drug</b> <b>traffickers</b> in the illicit drugs discourse. Despite the diversity of disciplinary approaches to this field, discussions on <b>drug</b> <b>traffickers</b> are predominantly underpinned [...] implicitly or explicitly - by neoclassical economic assumptions. This has consequently led to a narrow conceptualisation of <b>drug</b> <b>traffickers</b> as amoral, selfinterested, profit-driven, utility maximisers. Previous research that have explored the experiences of <b>drug</b> <b>traffickers</b> {{beyond the realm of}} neoclassical economic have highlighted how such individuals are embedded within a complex web of socioeconomic, cultural and political structures. Building upon such studies, this paper argues that <b>drug</b> <b>traffickers</b> need to be brought to the forefront of illicit drugs research in order to obtain a more comprehensive picture of the illicit drug trade. Drawing on the author's own research on Vietnamese women <b>drug</b> <b>traffickers</b> in Australia, this paper will show how decisions to become involved in the illicit drug trade as either cultivators, sellers or importers transcend beyond neoclassical economic assumptions in that they are often influenced by social relationships, and embedded within Vietnamese cultural expectations of women's roles within the family...|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "narcoculture" [...] {{was first}} coined in the 1970s. Narcoculture defines {{the way of}} life and ideas of <b>drug</b> <b>traffickers.</b> Its {{existence}} depends on the acceptance of <b>drug</b> <b>traffickers</b> and <b>drug</b> trafficking, becoming a transnational network of production, transportation, and commercialization of illegal drugs.|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to identify common characteristics of <b>drug</b> <b>traffickers</b> and assault and battery offenders to better understand and explore factors associated with their problems. To attain this objective, the following areas on the two groups were addressed: (a) family structure, (b) education, (c) peer association, (d) personal areas of their lives, and (e) self-esteem. A comparative research design was used in the study. Questionnaires were given to adolescent, adjudicated, black male residents in the Atlanta Youth Development Center, located in the Atlanta Metropolitan area. A population of 110 males from ages ten to seventeen were being housed at the time of the study. Of this population the sample study consisted of 50, 25 <b>drug</b> <b>traffickers</b> (Group I) and 25 assault and battery offenders (Group II). The hypotheses were as follows: (1) There is no statistical, significant difference in the mean scores between <b>drug</b> <b>traffickers</b> and assault and battery offenders with reference to their measure of education. (2) There is no statistical significant difference in the mean scores between <b>drug</b> <b>traffickers</b> and assault and battery offenders with reference to their measures of family support. (3) There is no statistical, significant difference in the mean scores between <b>drug</b> <b>traffickers</b> and assault and battery offenders with reference to their measures of peer relations. (4) There is no statistical, significant difference in the mean scores between <b>drug</b> <b>traffickers</b> and assault and battery offenders with reference to their measures of self-esteem. The study was an attempt to provide a clear understanding and common characteristics of adjudicated <b>drug</b> <b>traffickers</b> and assault and battery offenders 2 ̆ 7 family status, peer groups and personal areas in relation to their self-esteem. The findings of the study revealed that both of the groups had low self-esteem; however, the assault and battery offenders had higher self-esteem than that of the <b>drug</b> <b>traffickers...</b>|$|R
5|$|By {{the late}} 1960s Massino was a Bonanno associate. He led a {{successful}} truck hijacking crew, {{with the assistance}} of his brother-in-law Salvatore Vitale and carjacker Duane Leisenheimer, while fencing the stolen goods and running numbers using the lunch wagon as a front. He also befriended another mob hijacker, future Gambino crime family boss John Gotti. Increasingly prosperous, Massino opened his own catering company, J Catering, which became another front for his activities. Massino's mentor Rastelli was expected to become Bonanno boss upon the 1973 death of Natale Evola, but he had been convicted the previous year of loansharking and then in 1976 of extortion, leaving him imprisoned. In his absence Carmine Galante, a former consigliere and convicted <b>drug</b> <b>trafficker,</b> seized control of the Bonannos as unofficial acting boss.|$|E
5|$|Jackson's {{earliest}} public controversy {{came when}} he was linked to alleged Nigerian <b>drug</b> <b>trafficker</b> Pius Ailemen. Ailemen {{was supposed to be}} Jackson's best man at his 1991 wedding, but canceled at the last minute due to supposed passport-related issues. Jackson and Aileman were investigated by the FBI; the investigation and court proceedings extended for several years. A wiretap recorded many conversations between the two, and financial records indicate that Ailemen had purchased an Alfa Romeo using a $13,000 charge on Jackson's credit card. Ailemen was sentenced to 24 years and four months in jail. In 2003, Ailemen was denied petition for a writ of certiorari. Ailemen's current motion questions Jackson's activities as a government informant {{at the time of his}} testimony in Ailemen's trial.|$|E
5|$|Noriega {{took great}} care to shape {{perceptions}} of himself. He permitted and encouraged rumors {{that as the}} chief of intelligence, he was in possession of negative information about everybody in the country. Dinges suggests that the impression among some officials that Noriega made money off of every transaction in the country may have been cultivated by Noriega himself. Among opposition leaders in Panama he was seen variously as a sexual pervert, as a sadist, and a rapist. Within U.S. government circles contradictory images abounded; Noriega {{was seen as a}} CIA spy, a <b>drug</b> <b>trafficker,</b> a nationalist supporting Torrijos, an ally of Cuba, and an ally of Oliver North and the Contras. He was perceived as a trusted collaborator in the war against drugs, even as the DEA was investigating him for involvement in smuggling. By the time of his removal he had come to be hated in the U.S., and the invasion was portrayed as an attempt to remove an evil man. Dinges writes that these contradictory images played a large role in the U.S. government's self-contradictory policy towards Noriega.|$|E

5|$|Given that Moreno González's {{body was}} never {{recovered}} from the December 2010 shootout where officials said he was killed, there were rumors that he was alive and secretly leading the Knights Templar Cartel, the split-off group of La Familia Michoacana. On June 2011, members of La Familia Michoacana set up several public banners throughout the state of Guerrero with written messages directed to the former President Calderón and his security spokesman Alejandro Poiré. The banners proclaimed that Moreno González was in fact alive and leading the Knights Templar Cartel, {{and that the government}} was allegedly covering him up. The rumors were immediately denied by the Mexican government, which stood firm that the drug lord was killed by federal forces on December 9, 2010. Rumors sparked again in October 2011 following the arrest of Mario Buenrostro Quiroz, a <b>drug</b> <b>trafficker</b> who headed a Mexico City-based gang known as Los Aboytes. In a videotaped police confession, he told authorities that Moreno González was still alive and heading the cartel. Intelligence agency InSight Crime said the rumors were probably part of a campaign of the Knights Templar Cartel to win prestige from La Familia Michoacana by saying that their leader is in fact alive and still supporting the group. On 27 October 2012, the Mexican Army raided a safe house in Apatzingán where they believed the drug lord Enrique Plancarte Solís was hiding. Though the raid was ultimately unsuccessful because Plancarte Solís managed to avoid capture by sending several gunmen from his inner circle to battle off the soldiers, the authorities discovered several documents written for Moreno González. The Army gave the documents to the intelligence agency SIEDO for further investigation.|$|E
