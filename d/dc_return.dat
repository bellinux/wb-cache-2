5000|$|Hafele and Keating, in 1971, flew caesium atomic clocks {{east and}} west around the earth in {{commercial}} airliners, to compare the elapsed time against that of a clock that remained at the U.S. Naval Observatory. Two opposite effects came into play. The clocks were expected to age more quickly (show a larger elapsed time) than the reference clock, since {{they were in a}} higher (weaker) gravitational potential for most of the trip (c.f. Pound-Rebka experiment). But also, contrastingly, the moving clocks were expected to age more slowly because of the speed of their travel. From the actual flight paths of each trip, the theory predicted that the flying clocks, compared with reference clocks at the U.S. Naval Observatory, should have lost 40±23 nanoseconds during the eastward trip and should have gained 275±21 nanoseconds during the westward trip. Relative to the atomic time scale of the U.S. Naval Observatory, the flying clocks lost 59±10 nanoseconds during the eastward trip and gained 273±7 nanoseconds during the westward trip (where the error bars represent standard deviation). In 2005, the National Physical Laboratory in the United Kingdom reported their limited replication of this experiment. The NPL experiment differed from the original in that the caesium clocks were sent on a shorter trip (London-Washington, <b>D.C.</b> <b>return),</b> but the clocks were more accurate. The reported results are within 4% of the predictions of relativity, within the uncertainty of the measurements.|$|E
40|$|The Voyager Plasma Science (PLS) {{instrument}} {{is capable of}} returning integral (DC) current measurements, similar in some respects to measurements made with a Langmuir probe or a retarding potential analyzer, although there are significant differences. The integral measurements were made during a calibration sequence in the solar wind, during Cruise Science Maneuvers, and within the magnetospheres of Jupiter and Saturn by Voyager 1. After {{the failure of the}} PLS experiment following the Saturn encounter, that instrument was placed in the <b>DC</b> <b>return</b> mode returning possibly usable data from early 1981 through early 1985. The <b>DC</b> <b>return</b> measurements are difficult to interpret and are above threshold values only for relatively large fluxes; the determination of the measured current level is dependent on the operating temperature of the preamplifiers which further complicates the interpretation. Nevertheless, these measurements can be used to determine the efficiency of the suppressor grid at preventing the loss of secondary electrons off the collector plate. Some <b>DC</b> <b>return</b> measurements have been invaluable in aiding in the interpretation of some electron plasma measurements not previously understood. It is found that electron spectra can be significantly modified by the presence of second generation secondary electrons produced by either first generation secondaries or photoelectrons on the support ring of the negative high voltage modulator grid within the instrument housing...|$|E

The loop probe is designed for broadband response with simulated RL > 15 dB, and has an integrated <b>DC</b> <b>return</b> path, which can also be extended for biasing.

40|$|Abstract- The paper {{presents}} the results of numerical calculations of lightning surge currents and voltages in a telecommunication building during direct strike to the communication tower. The analysis concerned currents in waveguides and <b>DC</b> <b>return</b> conductors, potential differences between various installations and voltages induced in cable loops. The calculations were carried out using a numerical program based on the electromagnetic field theory and the method of moments. Large voltages were observed between isolated cable installations (even those running very close to each other). For cables grounded at one end the corresponding voltages were much lower. ...|$|E
30|$|The growing {{importance}} of online sales means that traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers {{need to create}} new distribution systems to serve customers through multiple channels. Building an effective and efficient omni-channel (OC) distribution system, however, leads to multiple challenges. The questions arise for example, from where online orders should be fulfilled, how delivery and return processes can be organized, and which context-specific OC distribution systems exist. Answering these questions retail research and practice require an overall view of the distribution concepts for direct-to-customer and store deliveries in OC retailing, including the associated return processes. This overall picture is still missing in the literature. We conducted an exploratory study to close this observable gap in the literature. This exploratory study is based on semi-structured interviews with major OC retailers in German-speaking countries and was complemented by market data research and discussions with further {{experts in the field}} of OC retailing. Based on the results of the study, the forward distribution system in OC retailing is characterized by the sources (supplier DCs, retailer DCs, stores) and destinations (home, store) which describe the options for store delivery, home delivery, and store pickup. Return processes are likewise characterized by the sources (store, home) and destinations (store, <b>DC,</b> <b>return</b> center). This framework forms the foundation for analyzing contextual criteria, identifying when the different conceptual designs are applied, determining industry-specific characteristics, and illustrating ways to further advance OC retailing. The present paper, therefore, contributes to the literature in three main areas: (1) it identifies and systematizes the forward and backward concepts in OC retailing, (2) it reveals application and development areas for achieving excellence in OC fulfillment and logistics, and (3) shows the need for developing sector- and context-specific OC distribution systems.|$|E
