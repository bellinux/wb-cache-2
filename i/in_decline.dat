40|$|We {{find that}} investors {{across the globe}} {{differentially}} prefer dividend-paying stocks over non-dividend-paying stocks more <b>in</b> <b>declining</b> markets than <b>in</b> advancing markets, whether in developed or emerging markets or {{before or after the}} 2008 global crisis, even accounting for growth opportunities, size and risk effects. Dividend paying stocks outperform non-dividend paying stocks, by between 0. 63 % (China) to 3. 79 % (Canada) more per month <b>in</b> <b>declining</b> markets than <b>in</b> advancing markets. <b>In</b> <b>declining</b> markets, dividend paying firms outperform by more than any underperformance in advancing markets. Our findings show the relative outperformance of dividend paying firms, both prior to and after the 2008 sub-prime crisis, separately assuming a segmented and a fully integrated global equity market, and excluding the month of dividend declaration. The result is also robust across subsets of emerging and developed markets, across legal environments and in respect to high and low levels of dividend payer participation. In summary, we find that it is a global result that dividends do matter to shareholders, but especially so <b>in</b> <b>declining</b> markets...|$|R
40|$|The study {{investigated}} politeness strategy in refusal {{conducted by the}} English teachers in Madiun regency relating to different social status levels and gender. The data were elicited, using discourse completion tasks (DCT), from 38 English teachers, 14 male and 24 female who teach in Junior high schools in Madiun regency. The collected data are analyzed by using Brown and Levinson’s theory of politeness strategy. The refusal strategies were classified based on modified refusal taxonomy by Beebe et al. (1990). The findings of the research are described {{in line with the}} problem statements as follows: first, The English teachers of junior high school in Madiun regency applied two semantic formulae indirect and direct strategies in conjunction to adjunct identified by Beebe et al. (1990) across three refusals acts (invitations, offers and suggestions). The indirect strategy was the prominent refusal strategy especially <b>in</b> <b>declining</b> offers and suggestions where as the direct strategy was the highest strategy used <b>in</b> <b>declining</b> invitations. The second, the English teachers used all four politeness strategies (BOR, positive politeness (PP), NP, and OR) of Brown and Levinson (1987) across three refusals acts in {{more or less the same}} frequency, except <b>in</b> <b>declining</b> offers they did not use OR strategy. <b>In</b> <b>declining</b> invitations and suggestions, most of the English teachers applied PP strategy and the dominant type was PP 13 Give reasons. The dominant strategy <b>in</b> <b>declining</b> offers was BOR which most of them expressed gratitude. The third, the influence of social distance on politeness strategy used by the English teachers <b>in</b> <b>declining</b> invitations, offers, and suggestions was not significant. The most prevalent strategy <b>in</b> <b>declining</b> three acts of refusals across status levels was PP strategy. PP strategy mostly dominated the refusals to collocutors of equal and lower status but in refusals to collocutors of higher status, most of English teachers used NP strategy. The last, gender differences virtually has no influence on the choices of politeness strategy in three refusals acts across status levels. Both male and female English teachers conducted the same politeness strategies of Brown and Levinson (1987) <b>in</b> <b>declining</b> invitations, offers, and suggestions in more or less the same frequency. They used PP significantly the highest and OR was the least dominant strategy. Females used PP and NP little bit more often than males but males used BOR and OR little bit more often than females...|$|R
