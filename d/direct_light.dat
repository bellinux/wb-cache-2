In early rendering algorithms, the <b>direct</b> <b>lighting</b> calculation was carried out on point luminaires, and the indirect lighting was approximated by an "ambient" term [3, 10]. This idea was later used by Whitted, but shadowing was added using visibility rays [15]. Cook extended this idea to area luminaires by using Monte Carlo integration [1]. Since then many researchers have extended Cook's method to include adaptive sampling [8, 2, 11, 5, 9]. One problem with Cook's method is that a <b>direct</b> <b>lighting</b> calculation generates [...] ...|$|R

Monte Carlo integration with importance sampling is used to carry out this calculation. Importance sampling involves the design of integrand-specific probability density functions which are used to generate sample points for the numerical quadrature. Probability density functions are presented that aid in the <b>direct</b> <b>lighting</b> calculation from luminaires of various simple shapes.

40|$|Modeling the {{interaction}} of light with real-world environments is a difficult prob-lem. In particular, the geometric and lighting complexity required to approximate reality are huge challenges. The “Ray Tracing ” algorithm is well-suited to deal with geometric complexity since its performance is sub-linear {{in the number of}} ge-ometric primitives. However, its computational cost is linear in the number of light sources. This leads to poor performance in environments with complex lighting. In this thesis we present two algorithms that accelerate the rendering of <b>direct</b> <b>lighting</b> for complex environments {{within the context of a}} ray tracer. The first al-gorithm, “Local Illumination Environments ” addresses <b>direct</b> <b>lighting</b> acceleration in scenes with up to a few dozen light sources. The second algorithm, “Hierarchical Light Clusters ” accelerates <b>direct</b> <b>lighting</b> in models with hundreds to thousands of light sources. The “Local Illumination Environments ” algorithm reduces the cost of comput-ing light visibility, the most expensive part of the <b>direct</b> <b>lighting</b> computation.

25|$|More {{sophisticated}} techniques {{will show}} proportional differences in optical density. Phase contrast {{is a widely}} used technique that shows differences in refractive index as difference in contrast. It {{was developed by the}} Dutch physicist Frits Zernike in the 1930s (for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1953). The nucleus in a cell for example will show up darkly against the surrounding cytoplasm. Contrast is excellent; however it is not for use with thick objects. Frequently, a halo is formed even around small objects, which obscures detail. The system consists of a circular annulus in the condenser, which produces a cone of light. This cone is superimposed on a similar sized ring within the phase-objective. Every objective has a different size ring, so for every objective another condenser setting has to be chosen. The ring in the objective has special optical properties: it, first of all, reduces the <b>direct</b> <b>light</b> in intensity, but more importantly, it creates an artificial phase difference of about a quarter wavelength. As the physical properties of this <b>direct</b> <b>light</b> have changed, interference with the diffracted light occurs, resulting in the phase contrast image. One disadvantage of phase-contrast microscopy is halo formation (halo-light ring).|$|E

500|$|Monet had {{previously}} painted a subject in different light and different moods. However, as he matured as a painter, his depictions of atmospheric influences were increasingly concerned {{not only with}} specific effects but with the overall color harmonies that allowed him an autonomous use of rich color. The conventional wisdom was that the stacks were a simple subject but also an unimaginative one. However, contemporary writers {{and friends of the}} artist noted that Monet's subject matter was always carefully chosen, the product of careful thought and analysis. [...] Monet undertook to capture the stacks in <b>direct</b> <b>light</b> and then to re-examine them from the same view-point in different, often more muted, light and atmospheric conditions. It was then not unusual for Monet, in search of harmonious transitions within the series, to alter the canvases back in his studio.|$|E

Due to the thick fog and heavy rain {{on the night of}} the concert, very little aerial footage was suitable for the final edit. Although two [...] "master angle" [...] cameras on tripods provided wide and overview shots, most of the camera operators filmed with hand-held cameras. The video cameras used had tube sensors, which created trails in the footage when they were pointed at <b>direct</b> <b>light</b> sources. As a result, much of the concert footage contains red streaks, prompting a notice on the future home video release informing viewers that the coloured lines in the footage [...] "are a result of special lighting effects, and are not caused by a tape defect or your equipment". The weather was cold enough that steam was coming out of the band members' mouths, and the Edge had difficulty playing guitar because his hands felt [...] "frozen stiff". Drummer Larry Mullen Jr. believes the weather contributed a dramatic atmosphere to the concert. Reduced attendance at the event was largely obscured in the concert footage by the thick mist that filled the air that evening, as well as strategic shots of the crowd. Taylor had a B-stage built onto the set to reduce the gap between the audience and Bono, allowing him to perform close to the audience, surrounded by fans on three sides. Sound mixing was managed by Steve Lillywhite, who produced U2's first three studio albums. Ezratty's portable 24-track recording system, Effanel Music, was used because a conventional mobile recording studio could not be moved close enough to the stage.|$|E

2500|$|Ibn al-Haytham (known in Western Europe as Alhacen or Alhazen) (965-1040), often {{regarded}} as the [...] "father of optics" [...] and a pioneer of the scientific method, formulated [...] "the first comprehensive and systematic alternative to Greek optical theories." [...] He postulated in his [...] "Book of Optics" [...] that light was reflected upon different surfaces in different directions, thus causing different light signatures for a certain object that we see. It was a different approach than that which was previously thought by Greek scientists, such as Euclid or Ptolemy, who believed rays were emitted from the eye to an object and back again. Al-Haytham, with this new theory of optics, was able to study the geometric aspects of the visual cone theories without explaining the physiology of perception. Also in his Book of Optics, Ibn al-Haytham used mechanics to try and understand optics. Using projectiles, he observed that objects that hit a target perpendicularly exert much more force than projectiles that hit at an angle. Al-Haytham applied this discovery to optics {{and tried to explain}} why <b>direct</b> <b>light</b> hurts the eye, because <b>direct</b> <b>light</b> approaches perpendicularly and not at an oblique angle. He developed a camera obscura to demonstrate that light and color from different candles can be passed through a single aperture in straight lines, without intermingling at the aperture. His theories were transmitted to the West. His work influenced Roger Bacon, John Peckham and Vitello, who built upon his work and ultimately transmitted it to Kepler.|$|E
