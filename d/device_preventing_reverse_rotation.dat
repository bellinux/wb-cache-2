40|$|A {{mechanical}} system is disclosed to deploy an antenna {{on a support}} which may, for example, be a spacecraft. A series of telescoping tubes are nested one within the other when the antenna is in a retracted stowed position. The outermost tube is rigidly attached to the support and the inner tubes are latched in the stowed position by a caging mechanism. The antenna is driven toward a deployed position by a dual motor driven cable which is terminated in a driving tube {{at the lower end}} of the innermost tube, from whence the cable is trained about pulleys at the tops and bottoms of successively large tubes of the antenna. The cable is wound on a drum {{at the lower end of}} the antenna and coaxial therewith. During deployment of the antenna, the drum rotates, thereby reeling in the deployment cable. The initial movement of the cable causes cam releasing of the latches in the caging device. Thereafter, the antenna tubes are extended until the final deployed position of the antenna is reached. A ratchet attached to the drum <b>prevents</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>rotation</b> of the drum and locks the antenna in the deployed position until the ratchet is released...|$|R
40|$|Molecules {{capable of}} {{mimicking}} {{the function of}} a wide range of mechanical devices have been fabricated, with motors that can induce mechanical movement attracting particular attention(1, 2). Such molecular motors convert light or chemical energy into directional rotary or linear motion(2 - 10), and are usually prepared and operated in solution. But if they are to be used as nanomachines that can do useful work, it seems essential to construct systems that can function on a surface, like a recently reported linear artificial muscle(11). Surface-mounted rotors have been realized and limited directionality in their motion predicted(12, 13). Here we demonstrate that a light-driven molecular motor capable of repetitive unidirectional rotation(14) can be mounted on the surface of gold nanoparticles. The motor design(14) uses a chiral helical alkene with an upper half that serves as a propeller and is connected through a carbon - carbon double bond (the rotation axis) to a lower half that serves as a stator. The stator carries two thiol-functionalized 'legs', which then bind the entire motor molecule to a gold surface. NMR spectroscopy reveals that two photo-induced cis-trans isomerizations of the central double bond, each followed by a thermal helix inversion to <b>prevent</b> <b>reverse</b> <b>rotation,</b> induce a full and unidirectional 3608 rotation of the propeller with respect to the surface-mounted lower half of the system...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} five years, ideas about protein folding inside cells have changed as a results of {{experiments}} with the chaperonin family of molecular chaperones, The folding of at least some proteins; is no longer regarded as a spontaneous energy-independent process, but as involving transient interactions with chaperonin ATPases that serve {{to increase the efficiency}} of correct folding within the highly crowded intracellular environment.

This paper describes how the <b>reverse</b> <b>rotation</b> effects on the spiral unidirectional {{dry gas seal}} performance and pressure distribution inside the gas film, also an investigation of using a different herringbone shape grooves configurations has been done using ANSYS FLUENT 14. 5 CFD simulation. The influence of decreasing rotational speed to the static condition and rotate in the reverse direction on internal flow and gas seal performance is examined from 10800 to - 10380 rpm. The {{results indicate that the}} internal pressure distribution inside the gas seal in <b>reverse</b> <b>rotation</b> is decreased and the open force consequently decreased by 4 %. The modification on the same seal is done to enhance its performance at <b>reverse</b> <b>rotation</b> condition. The herringbone spiral grooves is used with different configuration, the new configurations are examined in the forward and <b>reverse</b> <b>rotation</b> direction. The analysis for the pressure distribution is done and its effect on the seal performance is examined. Seal performance is compared with standard one for all geometrical and operating conditions. At high forward rotational speed 10380 rpm, the pressure {{at the end of the}} spiral groove is about 11. 4 % higher than the inlet pressure at the seal outer diameter, while at <b>reverse</b> <b>rotation,</b> the pressure is not increased in radial direction.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{response of}} a circularly-driven disk in a dissipative medium is considered. We {{focus on the}} role played by viscous friction in the spinning motion of the disk, especially on the effect called <b>reverse</b> <b>rotation,</b> where the intrinsic and orbital rotations are antiparallel. Contrary to what happens in the frictionless case, where steady <b>reverse</b> <b>rotations</b> are possible, we find that this dynamical behavior may exist only as a transient when dissipation is considered. Whether or not <b>reverse</b> <b>rotations</b> in fact occur depend on the initial conditions and on two parameters, one related to dragging, inertia, and driving, the other associated with the geometric configuration of the system. The critical value of this geometric parameter (separating the regions where <b>reverse</b> <b>rotation</b> is possible from those where it is forbidden) as a function of viscosity is well adjusted by a q-exponential function.

5000|$|Kline, Holcombe, and Eagleman (2004) {{confirmed}} {{the observation of}} <b>reversed</b> <b>rotation</b> with regularly spaced dots on a rotating drum. They called this [...] "illusory motion reversal". They showed that these occurred only after a long time of viewing the rotating display (from about 30 seconds to as long as 10 minutes for some observers). They also showed that the incidences of <b>reversed</b> <b>rotation</b> were independent {{in different parts of}} the visual field. This is inconsistent with discrete frames covering the entire visual scene. Kline, Holcombe, and Eagleman (2006) also showed that <b>reversed</b> <b>rotation</b> of a radial grating in one part of the visual field was independent of superimposed orthogonal motion in the same part of the visual field. The orthogonal motion was of a circular grating contracting so as to have the same temporal frequency as the radial grating. This is inconsistent with discrete frames covering local parts of visual scene. Kline et al. concluded that the <b>reverse</b> <b>rotations</b> were consistent with Reichardt detectors for the <b>reverse</b> direction of <b>rotation</b> becoming sufficiently active to dominate perception of the true rotation in a form of rivalry. The long time required to see the <b>reverse</b> <b>rotation</b> suggests that neural adaptation of the detectors responding to the true rotation has to occur before the weakly stimulated reverse-rotation detectors can contribute to perception.|$|R

40|$|International audienceTwo-dimensional {{simulations}} {{are used}} to investigate the flow past rotating circular cylinders near a wall in the low Reynolds number regime (20 <= Re <= 750). For the single cylinder case, rotation rates higher than previously studied are considered. For cylinders rolling forward, the wake flow structures observed {{are similar to those}} seen in previous studies; however, it is found that <b>reverse</b> <b>rotation</b> of the cylinder can completely suppress vortex shedding. The drag force on the cylinder is quantified. Linear stability analysis is used to determine the onset of three-dimensionality in the wake.

For the highest <b>reverse</b> <b>rotation</b> rate, three-dimensionality was suppressed at the higher end of the Reynolds number range investigated.
