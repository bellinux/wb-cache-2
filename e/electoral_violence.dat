25|$|With {{the defeat}} of the Confederacy in 1865, the Reconstruction Era began. The United States {{abolished}} slavery without compensation to slaveholders or reparations to freedmen. A Republican Party coalition of black freedmen, northern carpetbaggers and local scalawags controlled state government for three years. The white conservative Democrats regained control of the state legislature in 1870, in part by Ku Klux Klan violence and terrorism at the polls, to suppress black voting. Republicans were elected to the governorship until 1876, when the Red Shirts, a paramilitary organization that arose in 1874 and was allied with the Democratic Party, helped suppress black voting. More than 150 black Americans were murdered in <b>electoral</b> <b>violence</b> in 1876.|$|E
25|$|In 1961, Sierra Leone gained its {{independence}} from the United Kingdom. In the years {{following the death of}} Sierra Leone’s first prime minister Sir Milton Margai in 1964, politics in the country were increasingly characterized by corruption, mismanagement, and <b>electoral</b> <b>violence</b> that led to a weak civil society, the collapse of the education system, and, by 1991, an entire generation of dissatisfied youth were attracted to the rebellious message of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and joined the organization. Albert Margai, unlike his half-brother Milton, did not see the state as a steward of the public, but instead as a tool for personal gain and self-aggrandizement and even used the military to suppress multi-party elections that threatened to end his rule.|$|E

40|$|In June 2016, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) {{announced}} {{that more than}} 65 million persons have fled conflict and persecution. While certainly large in its own right, the number actually underestimates displacement in today’s world. Many millions more are displaced each year and cumulatively from a much broader range of life-threatening humanitarian crises than are captured by UNHCR’s figures. An average of 26. 4 million were displaced annually by acute natural hazards since 2008 and an unknown but sizable number displaced by gang and cartel <b>violence,</b> <b>electoral</b> and communal <b>violence,</b> nuclear and industrial accidents, {{and a range of}} other human-made disasters.

50|$|In December 1997, Kenyans went to {{the polls}} to elect members of {{parliament}} and the country's president. The elections were conducted in the glare of international publicity, not least because the international community was seriously concerned about whether the elections would be free and fair.

For instance, on Edisto Island where 1,000 Republicans and 50 Democrats resided, the polls never opened. The Red Shirts in Fairfield County physically beat anyone who dared vote for a Republican. Combined with the lack of a Republican candidate and new prohibitive voting laws, turnout was not surprisingly much less than the 1876 election.|$|R

50|$|The {{followers}} of Clodius carried {{his body to}} the Senate House, the Curia Hostilia, and set fire to it. In the ensuing unrest, the Senate called on Pompey to become sole consul.

Pompey handpicked Milo's jury, and the presiding magistrate, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 54 BC), was Pompey's client.|$|R
500|$|Pursuing decolonization, Mugabe's {{government}} emphasised the {{redistribution of}} land controlled by white farmers to landless blacks, initially on a [...] "willing seller-willing buyer" [...] basis. Frustrated at the slow rate of redistribution, from 2000 Mugabe encouraged the violent seizure of white-owned land. Food production was severely impacted, generating famine, international sanctions, and drastic economic decline. Opposition to Mugabe grew, particularly through the Movement for Democratic Change, {{although he was}} re-elected in 2002, 2008, and 2013 through campaigns dominated by <b>violence,</b> <b>electoral</b> fraud, and nationalistic appeals to his rural Shona voter base.

Specific characteristics of ICTs are particularly adapted to misuse in this manner.

Electoral fraud in Turkey has usually been most extensive during local elections, where individual votes have significantly larger impact in determining local administrations. Although the 2014 presidential election saw little evidence of electoral misconduct, issues regarding voter records as well as extensive media bias have been controversial issues that have remained largely unaddressed. In both the local and presidential elections in 2014, several voters reported that ballot papers had been sent to addresses that are wrong or do not exist as well as voters that have been dead for a substantial amount of time.|$|R
