5|$|The {{pre-production}} <b>Griffon</b> I {{shared the}} R engine's bore and stroke, but was otherwise {{a completely new}} design that first ran in the Experimental Department in November 1939. Although this single engine was never flown, the production version, the <b>Griffon</b> II, first flew in 1941 installed in the Fairey Firefly. A {{significant difference between the}} R and the production <b>Griffon</b> was the re-location of the camshaft and supercharger drives {{to the front of the}} engine to reduce overall length. Another length-reducing measure was the use of a single magneto (the R had two, mounted at the rear), this again was moved to the front of the engine.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} war the site {{repaired}} and overhauled Merlin and <b>Griffon</b> engines, and continued to manufacture spare parts. Finally, following {{the production of the}} Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet and others, the factory was closed in 2005.|$|E
50|$|Missouri Western's {{football}} program {{dates back to}} 1970. The <b>Griffons</b> won two conference championships, in 2003 and 2012. Under Jerry Partridge the <b>Griffons</b> {{have appeared in the}} Division II playoffs in 2006, 2010, 2011, and 2012.|$|R
50|$|The 2016 Missouri Western <b>Griffons</b> {{football}} team represented Missouri Western State University in the 2016 NCAA Division II football season. The <b>Griffons</b> played their home games on Craig Field in Spratt Stadium in St. Joseph, Missouri, {{as they have}} done since 1970. 2016 was the 47th season in school history. The <b>Griffons</b> were led by twentieth-year head coach, Jerry Partridge. Missouri Western {{has been a member}} of the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association since 1989.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Griffons</b> tend to {{bond with}} one human more than others. In fact, <b>Griffons</b> are very good with {{children}} provided they are not teased. [...] They are not very patient but do love to play. <b>Griffons</b> tend to get along well with other animals in the house, including cats, ferrets, and other dogs. [...] However, they can get into trouble {{because they have no}} concept of their own relative size and may attempt to dominate dogs much larger than themselves.|$|R

5|$|<b>Griffon</b> {{operates}} {{with three}} steel and fiberglass trains, colored red, yellow, and black. Each train has three rows that seat ten riders across {{for a total}} of 30 riders per train; each seat has its own individual over-the-shoulder restraint with a seatbelt. This configuration allows the ride to achieve a theoretical hourly capacity of 1,400 riders per hour. Unlike traditional roller coasters, Griffon's trains are floorless, allowing the riders' legs to dangle throughout the ride. Riders also experience up to 4 times the force of gravity.|$|E

5|$|SheiKra {{was also}} the first Dive Coaster to feature a 90-degree drop. In 2005, only two other Dive Coasters in the world had either an 87- or 87.5-degree drop. When SheiKra first opened, it was the tallest, fastest, and longest Dive Coaster ever built, and was the first Dive Coaster in North America. However, in 2007 when <b>Griffon</b> opened at Busch Gardens Williamsburg, SheiKra lost the height and speed records. When Dive Coaster opened at Chime-Long Paradise in 2008, it took the length record.|$|E
5|$|According to {{an early}} {{estimate}} by The Globe and Mail, 25,000 uniformed police officers, 1,000 security guards from Commissionaires Great Lakes, and several Canadian military forces were to be deployed during the summit. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) conducted Amalgam Virgo exercises on May 6 and 7 across the Greater Toronto Area using CF-18 Hornet jets, CH-124 Sea Kings, and CH-146 <b>Griffon</b> helicopters at low altitudes. The total cost for security at both the G8 and the G20 summits {{was determined to be}} , paid entirely by the federal Crown-in-Council, excluding the costs of any possible damage to local business.|$|E
5|$|During the 1600s and 1700s, The Three Fires Confederacy {{controlled}} much of {{the area}} known as {{the hub of the}} Great Lakes, which included the Canadian shore where Sarnia is now located. During this time, it maintained relations with many of the First Nations, including Huron, Sioux, and Iroquois, as well as the countries of Great Britain and France. Their trading partners, the Huron, welcomed La Salle and the <b>Griffon</b> in 1679 after he sailed into Lake Huron. The Ontario Heritage Trust erected a historical plaque under the Blue Water Bridge in commemoration of the voyage, as shown in the photo.|$|E

5|$|A Floorless Coaster {{is a type}} {{of steel}} roller coaster {{manufactured}} by Bolliger & Mabillard where riders sit with no floor underneath them allowing their feet to swing freely just above the track. Development of the Floorless Coaster began between 1995 and 1996 with Medusa (now known as Bizarro) at Six Flags Great Adventure opening on April 2, 1999, making it the world's first Floorless Coaster. Floorless Coasters also tend to have 3 to 7 inversions incorporated in the layout of the coaster. Recently, Bolliger & Mabillard have used floorless trains on their Dive Coasters, such as <b>Griffon</b> and SheiKra. Though they contain floorless trains, the coasters are still not considered Floorless Coasters as B classifies them as another model. Also, Maurer Söhne have designed their own version of the Floorless Coaster, a variant of their X-Car called X-Car Floorless, but currently do not have any installations.|$|E
5|$|According to Walter Bolliger, {{development}} of the Dive Coaster began between 1994 and 1995. On March 14, 1998, the world's first Dive Coaster, Oblivion, opened at Alton Towers. Though Oblivion is classified as a Dive Coaster, {{it does not have}} a true vertical drop as the drop angle is 87-degrees. Two years later, the second Dive Coaster built, Diving Machine G5, opened at Janfusun Fancyworld and also does not have a vertical drop. In 2005, SheiKra opened at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay and was the first Dive Coaster to feature a 90-degree drop and a splashdown element. In 2007, Busch Gardens Williamsburg announced that <b>Griffon</b> would be the first ever Dive Coaster to feature floorless trains and SheiKra would have its trains replaced with floorless ones. In 2011, the first 'mini' Dive Coaster opened at Heide Park Resort, named Krake. Unlike other Dive Coasters, Krake has smaller trains consisting of three rows of six riders.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Britain, the Spitfire {{superseded}} the Hurricane {{to become}} the backbone of RAF Fighter Command, and saw action in the European, Mediterranean, Pacific, and South-East Asian theatres. Much loved by its pilots, the Spitfire served in several roles, including interceptor, photo-reconnaissance, fighter-bomber and trainer, and it continued to serve in these roles until the 1950s. The Seafire was a carrier-based adaptation of the Spitfire which served in the Fleet Air Arm from 1942 through to the mid-1950s. Although the original airframe {{was designed to be}} powered by a Rolls-Royce Merlin engine producing 1,030hp (768kW), it was strong enough and adaptable enough to use increasingly powerful Merlins and, in later marks, Rolls-Royce <b>Griffon</b> engines producing up to 2,340hp (1,745kW). As a consequence of this, the Spitfire's performance and capabilities improved over the course of its service life.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{successful}} aircraft engines of the World War II era, some fifty marks of Merlin were built by Rolls-Royce in Derby, Crewe and Glasgow, as well as by Ford of Britain at their Trafford Park factory, near Manchester. A de-rated version was also the basis of the very successful Rolls-Royce/Rover Meteor tank engine. Post-war, the Merlin was largely superseded by the Rolls-Royce <b>Griffon</b> for military use, with most Merlin variants being designed and built for airliners and military transport aircraft. Production ceased in 1956 with the fulfilment of an order for 170 Merlins for the Spanish Air Force's CASA 2.111 and Hispano Aviación HA-1112 aircraft, after 160,000 engines had been delivered. In addition, the Packard V-1650 was a version of the Merlin built in the United States, itself produced in numbers upwards of 55,000 examples, and was the principal engine used in the North American P-51 Mustang.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Final Fantasy VII, where a {{character}} could equip {{three types of}} equipment (weapon, armor and accessory), Vincent's equipment consists solely of his weapon, which can contribute to his armor rating and enhance his stats through customization. Vincent has three basic gun frames available to him; a three barrel handgun called Cerberus, a rifle called Hydra, and a machine gun called <b>Griffon.</b> There are also several different barrels available throughout the game; short, regular and long, with longer barrels allowing easier long-range targeting, but reducing Vincent's movement speed due to their weight. Accessories, which can {{be attached to the}} weapons, include a sniper scope, charms which can increase Vincent's defense and decrease the weight of the gun (among other things), and materia, which enables magic shots with special properties that use up Vincent's magic points. Ammunition capacity can also be increased through upgrades.|$|E
