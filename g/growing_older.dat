25|$|Frontman Justin Pierre {{composed}} the lyrics for Go, which is themed around mortality, <b>growing</b> <b>older,</b> {{and learning to}} live in the moment. The reflective tone includes subjects such as procrastination, relationship miscommunication, and optimism, but also personal struggles such as the death of loved ones. Many songs on Go were developed over years at a time, and several date to the band's first few studio albums. Musically, the album retains the band's pop-rock, Moog-based sound, with a heavier emphasis on electronic experimentation. Following the album's recording, the band entered talks with Epitaph Records, where they were signed from 2003 to 2008. Discussions with label founder Brett Gurewitz led the band to re-sign with Epitaph, who co-released Go alongside the band's own label, The Boombox Generation. It is the final album by the band to feature long-time drummer Tony Thaxton before he announced his departure on March, 20th, 2013.|$|E

500|$|Many of Angelou's poems can be {{characterized}} as light verse.

[...] In this volume and in others, Angelou pairs poems together ("America" [...] and [...] "Africa"; [...] "Communication I" [...] and Communication II") to strengthen her themes.|$|E

500|$|Reaction to [...] "You're Getting Old" [...] was positive. Critics {{pointed to}} the self-referencing aim of the episode in <b>growing</b> <b>older</b> and redefining senses of humor as well as cynicism. While Ramsey Isler of IGN found the episode to be largely humorless and monotonous, he {{interpreted}} this as intentional {{on the part of}} the show's creators, who he believed had grown weary of creating the series. Isler called the final moments of the episode [...] "the most somber material the series has ever produced... providing the emotional soundtrack for a montage of images that just rip the heart out of any South Park fan", giving the episode an 8.5/10. HitFix's review on the episode focused on its personal philosophic themes, with reviewer Alan Sepinwall stating [...] "But what was interesting about Stan's existential crisis, and how he struggled to like anything, is that the show's philosophy has often largely been about how other people care too much about things... Yet here, Stan's lack of passion – and the Marsh parents' – was clearly shown to be a bad thing for them." ...|$|E
500|$|Revisiting Thunderbirds Are Go {{from more}} recent {{perspectives}} {{has led to}} different interpretations: Jeff Stafford of Turner Classic Movies regards the film in its entirety as a [...] "pop culture novelty as fascinating and endearing as a toy from one's childhood." [...] He agrees, however, that the model sequences are protracted: [...] "You'll feel yourself <b>growing</b> <b>older</b> as cranes and hydraulic lifts slowly – very slowly – prepare for a missile launch." [...] Meanwhile, William Gallagher of BBC Online offers a positive review, asserting that Thunderbirds Are Go is [...] "every bit as good" [...] as the television series. However, he also suggests that {{its status as a}} film adaptation faithful to its original is an inherent weakness, and that Thunderbirds functions better as a television series, writing of the film's content: [...] "Certainly there's no greater profundity or universal theme to the film, it is just an extended episode." [...] Gallagher rates Thunderbirds Are Go three stars out of five, as does a review on the Film4 website.|$|E

[...] Grohl also stated that [...] "the idea now is to step up and make [...] Odessey and Oracle" [...] - [...] the album he claimed to have listened the most during production - and that [...] "it has always been my dream to mix Steely Dan with Nomeansno." [...] Amidst the amount of heavier tracks and themes Grohl decided to include the song [...] "Cheer Up, Boys (Your Make Up Is Running)", described as [...] "the most light-hearted, melodic song of all" [...] which [...] "seemed like a little ray of hope in the middle of all this despair." [...] Grohl added that there was a bigger focus on melodies even in heavier tracks such as [...] "The Pretender", [...] "Let It Die" [...] and [...] "Erase/Replace", and that album closer [...] "Home", a ballad featuring Grohl on the piano, was [...] "the best song I've ever written".|$|E

[...] People who view assistive devices as enabling greater independence accept and use them. Those who see them as symbols of disability reject them.
