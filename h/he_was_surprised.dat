5|$|The album leaked {{two weeks}} before its release, despite being under {{a very high level}} of security. Hoppus commented to NME that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> it took so long to leak and was {{relieved}} rather than annoyed that it had, reading warm comments about the album online.|$|E
5|$|Jazz {{musician}} Putter Smith {{was invited}} by Harry Saltzman to play Mr. Kidd, after a Thelonious Monk Band show. Musician Paul Williams was originally cast as Mr. Wint. When he couldn't {{agree with the}} producers on compensation, Bruce Glover replaced him. Glover said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> at being chosen, because at first producers said he was too normal and that they wanted a deformed, Peter Lorre-like actor.|$|E
60|$|Oh! [At first <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>surprised,</b> then, as {{the amount}} sinks into his mind, grows doubtful.] That's a very {{different}} pair of shoes.|$|R

5|$|After {{four and}} a half months of {{research}} in Spain, Littleton visited the site of his war-time service in Naples. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> to find seven small glass factories there. On a later visit to the island of Murano, he visited more than fifty glass factories. He was fascinated by the little demonstration furnaces that some of the factories placed outside their walls. The furnaces would be staffed by a couple of the factory's glassblowers, who would perform their craft for tourists. His meeting with Sala and his Murano experiences stimulated his interest in making glass art in a private studio.|$|E
5|$|After graduating a Bachelor of Arts, Tarr was {{articled}} to the solicitors firm of Owston, Dickinson, Simpson, and Bigg in Leicester, {{and also}} joined the Leicester Tigers, {{then as now}} {{considered one of the}} strongest clubs in the country. He scored 72 points in 94 appearances. In 1913, having been dropped by England four years earlier, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> to be called up again to play Scotland on 15 March at Twickenham. Tarr was not at his best and it was to be his last international appearance. England, meanwhile, only managed a 3–0 victory, but it was enough to regain the Calcutta Cup and earn its first Grand Slam.|$|E
5|$|Brashear has {{represented}} the United States on two separate occasions. He made his international debut at the 1997 World Championship, where he registered two goals and five points in eight games, helping the Americans to a sixth-place finish. He later noted that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> by the invitation, but {{felt that it}} gave him an opportunity to show he could play other roles besides being an enforcer. He played for the U.S. again the following year at the World Championship, playing in six games and accumulating ten penalty minutes as the Americans finished in 12th place.|$|E

5|$|In the off-season, Malhotra {{was drafted}} by the New York Rangers in the first round, seventh overall, of the 1998 NHL Entry Draft. The Rangers scouted him as a strong, {{physical}} player with good hockey sense and character, comparing him to Adam Graves. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> to have been selected by the Rangers, as they {{were one of the}} only teams to have not interviewed or met with him prior to the draft. He anticipated being drafted by the Calgary Flames at sixth overall, as the team's general manager, Al Coates had previously drafted him into the OHL as general manager of the Storm.|$|E
5|$|It is {{told that}} an Indian boy named Mariano Mayta {{used to watch}} over his father's herd of alpaca {{on the slopes of}} the mountain. He wandered into the snowfields of the glacier, where he {{encountered}} a mestizo boy named Manuel. They became good friends, and Manuel provided Mariano with food. When the boy did not return home for meals, Mariano's father went looking for his son. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> to find his herd had increased. As a reward, he sent Mariano to Cusco to get new clothes. Mariano asked to buy some also for Manuel, who wore the same outfit everyday. His father agreed, so Mariano asked Manuel for a sample in order to buy the same kind of cloth in Cusco.|$|E
5|$|Juventus {{confirmed}} on 18 October 2011 {{that the}} 2011–12 season would be Del Piero's last with the club. The 2011–12 season under new manager Antonio Conte, his former Juventus teammate, saw Del Piero being used sparingly, and mainly as a substitute, {{because of the}} summer arrival of forward Mirko Vučinić from Roma. Del Piero scored his first goal in the new Juventus Stadium on 24 January 2012, in a 3–0 win over Roma in the quarter-finals of the Coppa Italia. Later in the season, Del Piero stated that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> at Juventus president Andrea Agnelli's announcement regarding the club's decision not to offer him a new contract.|$|E

5|$|Realising {{that he was}} in danger, Levski {{decided to}} flee to Romania, where he would meet Karavelov and discuss these events. First, however, he had to collect {{important}} documentation from the committee archive in Lovech, which would constitute important evidence if seized by the Ottomans. He stayed at the nearby village inn in Kakrina, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> and arrested on the morning of 27 December 1872. Starting with the writings of Lyuben Karavelov the most accepted version has been that a priest named Krastyo Nikiforov betrayed Levski to the police. This theory has been disputed by the researchers Ivan Panchovski and Vasil Boyanov for lack of evidence.|$|E
5|$|Ross Goodall {{uploaded}} {{the message}} from Capaldi to the video-sharing website YouTube on 6 November 2014. He commented at the video's YouTube location that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> at the online response, and {{that at the time}} of initial posting was unaware it would become viral. He later explained that he had uploaded it only to share it with family members on completion of the memorial services for Thomas's grandmother. Thomas's father wrote that the video greatly affected his son, and enabled him to cope with grief and feel comforted. He praised Capaldi for his kind act and explained that the video improved his son's mental well-being throughout the ordeal.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Krasos was {{a battle}} in the Arab–Byzantine Wars {{that took place in}} August 804, between the Byzantines under Emperor Nikephoros I (r. 802–811) and an Abbasid army under Ibrahim ibn Jibril. Nikephoros' {{accession}} in 802 resulted in a resumption of warfare between Byzantium and the Abbasid Caliphate. In late summer 804, the Abbasids had invaded Byzantine Asia Minor for one of their customary raids, and Nikephoros set out to meet them. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised,</b> however, at Krasos and heavily defeated, barely escaping with his own life. A truce and prisoner exchange were afterwards arranged. Despite his defeat, and a massive Abbasid invasion the next year, Nikephoros persevered until troubles in the eastern provinces of the Caliphate forced the Abbasids to conclude a peace.|$|E

5|$|The Mae Shi drummer Brad Breeck commented in an {{interview}} that the band decided to make a song about the incident late in the evening of February 2, 2009. Breeck noted that they listened to the audio of the Bale diatribe and put together their tribute piece within a span of two hours before putting it online. Jacob Cooper, another drummer in the band, commented to The Arizona Daily Star that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> how popular their piece became when they had devoted relatively little time to composing and recording it.|$|E
5|$|While Boone recovered, Shawnees kept {{up their}} attacks outside Boonesborough, {{destroying}} the surrounding cattle and crops. With {{the food supply}} running low, the settlers needed salt to preserve what meat they had, so in January 1778, Boone led a party of 30 men to the salt springs on the Licking River. On February 7, 1778, when Boone was hunting meat for the expedition, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> and captured by warriors led by Blackfish. Because Boone's party was greatly outnumbered, Boone returned {{the next day with}} Blackfish and persuaded his men to surrender rather than put up a fight.|$|E
5|$|Callaway said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> by UPN's {{cancellation}} of Mercy Point {{because of their}} strong support of the show. He felt {{the decision was made}} {{in part because of the}} show's high production costs. He also concluded that the decision to broadcast the pilot at the same time as the World Series resulted in the loss of Mercy Points target audience. To better connect with UPN's teen viewers, Callaway shifted the show's focus from medical and ethical cases to the characters' relationships. Despite these revisions, he said that UPN executives preferred to air shows like Moesha over science-fiction programs. When UPN announced the show's cancellation, the eighth episode was in the middle of production. Scenes originally written for the episode were revised and edited into the seventh episode to form a complete series finale.|$|E

5|$|Charlton married Pat Kemp on 6 January 1958, and {{his brother}} Bobby acted as his best man. They have three children: John (born in January 1959), Deborah (born 1961) and Peter, who was born just after Charlton senior played in the 1966 World Cup final. During the 1960s he ran two clothes shops in Leeds, and he also later {{operated}} the souvenir shop at Elland Road. Charlton is a keen amateur fisherman and also takes part in field sports. He appeared on Desert Island Discs in 1972 and 1996, and chose to take with him The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain, the Encyclopaedia of How to Survive, a spyglass, and a fishing rod. Charlton {{was the subject of}} This Is Your Life in 1973 when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> by Eamonn Andrews.|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} of 1990, Anjali Dutt was hired to replace Moulder, who had left {{to work with the}} bands Shakespears Sister and Ride. Dutt {{assisted}} in the recording of vocals and several guitar tracks. During this period, the band recorded in various studios, often spending just a single day at a studio before deciding that it was unsuitable. In May 1990, My Bloody Valentine settled on Protocol in Holloway as their primary location, and work began in earnest on the album, as well as a second EP, Tremolo. Like Glider, Tremolo contained a song—"To Here Knows When"—that would later appear on Loveless. The band stopped recording during the summer of 1990 in order to tour in support of the release of Glider. When Moulder returned to the project in August, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> by how little work had been completed. By that point Creation Records was concerned at how much the album was costing. Moulder left again in March 1991 to work for the noise pop band The Jesus and Mary Chain.|$|E
5|$|Gatorade, {{now owned}} by PepsiCo, is today sold in some eighty {{countries}} and over fifty various flavors. In contrast to the forty-three dollars that Cade and his team spent {{to make the first}} experimental batch of Gatorade in 1965, Gatorade prompted the evolution of a multibillion-dollar sports drink industry in the years that followed; as of 2007, over seven billion bottles of Gatorade were being sold annually in the United States. While <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> by its commercial success as a sports drink, Cade took greater pride in Gatorade's use in hospitals, in post-operative recovery and to treat diarrhea-related dehydration in infants and young children. Cade's other research included hypertension, exercise physiology, autism, schizophrenia and kidney disease. His research into carbo-loading substantiated the early claims of Swedish researchers, and he also invented a hydraulic football helmet that substantially reduced the risk of concussion to football players.|$|E
