60|$|Prior to {{the year}} 1563, the voyages made by Spanish ships from Peru to Chili, were full of difficulty. Along this coast, the winds from the South most {{generally}} prevail; {{and it had been}} an invariable custom to keep close in with the land, from a superstitious conceit {{on the part of the}} Spaniards, that were they to lose sight of it, the eternal trade-wind would waft them into unending waters, from whence would be no return. Here, involved among tortuous capes and headlands, shoals and reefs, beating, too, against a continual head wind, often light, and sometimes for days and weeks sunk into utter calm, the provincial vessels, in many cases, suffered the extremest hardships, in passages, which at the present day seem to have been incredibly protracted. There is on record in some collections of nautical disasters, an account of one of these ships, which, starting on a voyage whose duration was estimated at ten days, spent four months at sea, and indeed never again entered harbor, for in the end she was cast away. Singular to tell, this craft never encountered a gale, but was the vexed sport of malicious calms and currents. Thrice, out of provisions, she put back to an <b>intermediate</b> <b>port,</b> and started afresh, but only yet again to return. Frequent fogs enveloped her; so that no observation could be had of her place, and once, when all hands were joyously anticipating sight of their destination, lo! the vapors lifted and disclosed the mountains from which they had taken their first departure. In the like deceptive vapors she at last struck upon a reef, whence ensued a long series of calamities too sad to detail.|$|E

Ennore Port was recently converted from an <b>intermediate</b> <b>port</b> to a major port and handles all the coal and ore traffic in Tamil Nadu. The volume of cargo in the ports grew by 13 per cent over 2005. The Tuticorin Port is expanding its facilities at the cost of US$1.6 billion.

40|$|Abstract—Optical {{switching}} fabrics (OSFs) {{are receiving}} increasing {{attention in the}} design of highspeed packet switches, due to their excellent properties in terms of available bandwidth and reduced power consumption. However, for most optical devices, the latency needed to reconfigure inputÕoutput switch port connections may not be negligible with respect to the packet transmission time and can adversely affect switch performance, creating high delays and reduced throughput. We consider OSFs, and we propose a multihop approach to schedule packet transfers; i. e., packets are sent to the final destination port by exploiting transmission through <b>intermediate</b> <b>ports.</b> We show that the multihop approach is a promising technique to control the trade-off between delay and throughput, and it permits us to partly decouple the switch reconfiguration rate from the packet duration. We propose a general framework to solve the issue of multihop transmission in input-queued packet switches. Furthermore, we examine the multihop approach when the direct exchange of packets among ports is based on multidimensional regular topologies. We discuss which sequence of <b>intermediate</b> <b>ports</b> should be traversed to reach the final output port (i. e., the internal routing) and the switch timescheduling problem (i. e., when a pair of ports can exchange packets). Performance is analyzed both analytically and by simulation...|$|R

5000|$|A {{test for}} Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups {{conducted}} by Dr Toomas Kivisild on Sinhalese of Sri Lanka {{has shown that}} 23% of the subjects were R1a1a (R-SRY1532) positive.

The Vangas are generally identified as Bengalis. On the other hand, Lata is identified with modern-day Gujarat, and Sinhapura with modern Sihor in the Kathiawar peninsular of Gujarat. Furthermore, the Mahawamsa states that Vijaya landed first at Supparaka (identified with modern Sopara, in the Thane district of Maharashtra), while the Dipavamsa mentions 'Suppara' and a further <b>intermediate</b> <b>port,</b> Bharukkaccha (modern Bharuch, a port in Gujarat, {{at the mouth of the}} Narmada).
