5|$|In April 2012, the USDA {{received}} {{requests from}} beef processors to allow voluntary labeling of products with the additive, and stated it planned to approve labeling after checks for label accuracy. Both BPI and Cargill {{made plans to}} label products that contain the additive to alleviate these concerns and restore consumer confidence. Following the USDA announcement to allow choices in purchasing decisions for <b>ground</b> <b>beef,</b> many school districts stated that they would opt out of serving <b>ground</b> <b>beef</b> with LFTB. By June 2012, 47 out of 50 U.S. states declined to purchase any of the product for the 2012–2013 school year while South Dakota Department of Education, Nebraska, and Iowa chose to continue buying it.|$|E
5|$|In the US, the {{additive}} is not {{for direct}} consumer sale. Lean finely textured beef can constitute up to 15% of <b>ground</b> <b>beef</b> without additional labeling, {{and it can be}} added to other meat products such as beef-based processed meats.|$|E

5|$|In March 2012, 70% of <b>ground</b> <b>beef</b> in the U.S. {{contained}} lean finely textured beef, and a {{year later}} in March 2013 the amount was estimated by meat industry officials to be at approximately 5%. This significant reduction {{is due in part to}} the extensive media coverage that began in March 2012 about the additive. Kroger Co. and Supervalu Inc. have stopped using the additive.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the product {{and the manner in}} which it is {{processed}} led to concerns that it might be a risk to human health, despite the fact that there have been no reported cases of foodborne illnesses due to consumption of the product. Among consumers, media reporting significantly reduced its acceptance as an additive to <b>ground</b> <b>beef.</b>|$|E

5|$|Besides {{customer}} {{demand for}} the product, another major reason for the reintroduction was due to a significant rise {{in the cost of}} beef. During the previous few {{months leading up to the}} reintroduction of Chicken Fries, the available cattle stocks had declined since the USDA began record keeping in 1973. This shortage of <b>ground</b> <b>beef</b> caused a spike in the price of beef to all-time highs in June 2014, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Additionally, increasing competition from McDonald's, Wendy's and other chains in the fast food industry drove Burger King to boost sales by introducing new products along similar lines. Two major competitors had been revamping their menus with products such as variations on the McDouble from McDonald's and sandwiches based on pretzel-style buns from Wendy's.|$|E
5|$|The {{product is}} {{regulated}} in different manners in various regions. In the US, {{the product is}} allowed {{to be used in}} <b>ground</b> <b>beef,</b> and it can be used in other meat products such as beef-based processed meats. The use of ammonia as an anti-microbial agent is approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and is included on the FDA's list of GRAS (generally recognized as safe) procedures, and is used in similar applications for numerous other food products, including puddings and baked goods. The product is banned in Canada due to the presence of ammonia in it, and it is banned for human consumption in the European Union. Some consumer advocacy groups have promoted the elimination of the product or for mandatory disclosure of additives in beef, while others have expressed concerns about plant closures that occurred after the product received significant news media coverage.|$|E

25|$|Holishkes, stuffed cabbage, {{also known}} as the cabbage roll, is also a European Jewish dish that emerged from more impoverished times for Jews. Because having a live cow was more {{valuable}} than to eat meat in the Middle Ages, Jews used fillers such as breadcrumbs and vegetables to mix with <b>ground</b> <b>beef.</b> This gave the effect of more meat that was stuffed into the cabbage leaves.|$|E

25|$|Transmission of {{pathogenic}} E. coli often occurs via fecal–oral transmission. Common {{routes of}} transmission include: unhygienic food preparation, farm contamination due to manure fertilization, irrigation of crops with contaminated greywater or raw sewage, feral pigs on cropland, or direct consumption of sewage-contaminated water. Dairy and beef cattle are primary reservoirs of E. coli O157:H7, {{and they can}} carry it asymptomatically and shed it in their feces. Food products associated with E. coli outbreaks include , raw <b>ground</b> <b>beef,</b> raw seed sprouts or spinach, raw milk, unpasteurized juice, unpasteurized cheese and foods contaminated by infected food workers via fecal–oral route.|$|E

Other pasta dishes are also cooked nowadays in the Filipino kitchen, like carbonara, pasta with alfredo sauce, and baked macaroni. These dishes are usually cooked for gatherings and special occasions, like family reunions or Christmas. Macaroni or other tube pasta is also used in sopas, a local chicken broth soup.|$|E
25|$|Beef is {{the culinary}} name for meat from cattle, {{particularly}} skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric times. Beef {{is a source}} of high-quality protein and essential nutrients. Depending on economics, the number of heifers kept for breeding varies. The meat from older bulls is usually tougher, so it is frequently used for mince (known as <b>ground</b> <b>beef</b> in the United States). Cattle raised for beef may be allowed to roam free on grasslands, or may be confined at some stage in pens as part of a large feeding operation called a feedlot (or concentrated animal feeding operation), where they are usually fed a ration of grain, protein, roughage and a vitamin/mineral preblend.|$|E

40|$|Meat {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the consumption pattern of most European and North American consumers. Meat production is responsible for a well known environmental pressure due to the inefficient conversion of plant protein to meat protein and alternatives sources, such as insects or algae, will be rapidly required. In a recent theorical study, de Boer et al. (2013) show that consumers prefer to eat a hybrid meat product (i. e. a mix of meat and its substitute) rather than a pure meat substitute [3]. Based on these preliminary results, hedonic tests were realized to assess the acceptability of insect-based burgers in a target population composed of people from 15 to 25 years old, considered as the future insect consumers. Isolated in a tasting booth, each participant was invited to taste four burger samples containing a ratio of 20 gr of protein by 100 gr of burger. The first burger was prepared with 95 % of <b>grounded</b> <b>beef</b> (1), the second with 95 % of green lentil (2), the third with 45 % of green lentil and 50 % of mealworms (Tenebrio molitor L.; Coleoptera, Tenebrionidae) and the fourth with 45 % of <b>grounded</b> <b>beef</b> burger and 50 % of mealworms. The last 5 % of each burger consists of an aromatization portion containing onions, carrots, tomato paste and garlic. Participants were asked to rate each sample on a 9 -point hedonic scale, where extreme sides were noted from “extremely dislike” (left) to “extremely like” (right). Tukey post-hoc comparisons on the appreciation results showed that beef-based products (with or without mealworms) were relatively preferred to lentil-based products (with or without mealworms), probably because hybrid meat burgers seem more familiar to the consumers than vegetable burgers, and that no liking differences were noticed between the two beef-based burgers and between the two insect-based burgers. These results confirm that shape and appearance are key criteria in the acceptation of meat substitute by non-vegetarian consumers and that insects will preferentially be consumed, in the future, if they are presented in an invisible way and associated with familiar flavors.
