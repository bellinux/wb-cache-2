25|$|I/O {{psychologists are}} {{involved}} in the research and the practice of occupational stress and design of individual and organizational interventions to manage and reduce the stress levels and increase productivity, performance, health and wellbeing. Occupational stress can have implications for organizational performance because of the emotions <b>job</b> <b>stress</b> evokes. For example, a job stressor such as conflict with a supervisor can precipitate anger that in turn motivates counterproductive workplace behaviors. I/O research has examined the association between work stressors and aggression, theft, substance abuse, and depressive symptoms. A number of models have been developed to explain the <b>job</b> <b>stress</b> process, including the person-environment fit model and the demand-control model. Those models became a cornerstone of the emergence, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, of a new discipline relevant to research on occupational stress; the discipline, occupational health psychology, is an offshoot of i/o psychology, health psychology, and occupational medicine.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{importance}} of individual differences cannot be ignored, scientific evidence suggests that certain working conditions are stressful to most people. Such evidence argues for {{a greater emphasis on}} working conditions as the key source of <b>job</b> <b>stress,</b> and for job redesign as a primary prevention strategy. Large surveys of working conditions, including conditions recognized as risk factors for <b>job</b> <b>stress,</b> were conducted in member states of the European Union in 1990, 1995, and 2000. Results showed a time trend suggesting an increase in work intensity. In 1990, the percentage of workers reporting that they worked at high speeds at least one-quarter of their working time was 48%, increasing to 54% in 1995 and to 56% in 2000. Similarly, 50% of workers reported they work against tight deadlines at least one-fourth of their working time in 1990, increasing to 56% in 1995 and 60% in 2000. However, no change was noted in the period 1995–2000 (data not collected in 1990) in the percentage of workers reporting sufficient time to complete tasks.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Stress {{levels of}} Dutch nurses {{have been found}} to {{increase}} since 2005. There is evidence that personal resources such as coping style and social support influence <b>job</b> related <b>stress.</b> However when formulating policy to reduce such stress, specific jobrelated factors must also be considered. The aim {{of the study was to}} gain insight into such job-related factors determining <b>job</b> related <b>stress.</b> Methods and Materials: The study population was made up of members from a nationally representative research sample referred to as the Nursing Staff Panel. Candidates for the Nursing Staff Panel were recruited from a random sample of employees. The Panel consists of Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs) and Registered Nurses (RNs). In 2009, 628 respondents completed a postal structured questionnaire about their work (response rate 66 %). First, all bivariate relationships between <b>job</b> related <b>stress</b> and possible predictors were examined. Than we included stepwise blocks of variables into regression analyses, starting with job related variables, then individual (background) characteristics and finally adding health care sector. Changes in explained variance were used to determine the unique additional contribution of each block. Results: The tested model explained about half of the variance within <b>job</b> related <b>stress.</b> <b>Job</b> related factors played a major role. <b>Job</b> related <b>stress</b> was mainly associated with four factors: the perceived quality of nursing care within the ward, the autonomy, workload and the perceived appreciation of the nursing staff by others within the organization. Individual determinants explained only 1 % of the variance. Nursing staff members working 20 – 30 h per week experienced less stress than those working < 20 or more than 30 h per week. Conclusion: Attempts to reduce <b>job</b> related <b>stress</b> is not only a matter of reducing workload. Enhancing the quality of patient care directly reduces stress levels, as well as giving nurses more autonomy and appreciation. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
40|$|Both {{perceived}} organizational {{support and}} <b>job</b> <b>stresses</b> have impact on employees’ work outcomes. Great progresses {{have been made}} in past researches. However, there are many disputes about the impact of perceived organizational support (POS) on job performance (especially, safety performance), the impact of <b>job</b> <b>stresses</b> on <b>job</b> performance (especially, safety performance) and job attitudes, as well as the interaction of subordinates’ POS and <b>job</b> <b>stresses,</b> and the impact of supervisor on subordinates’ POS et al [...] Thus, the aim of the study is to explore the impact of supervisors’ POS, leader-member exchange(LMX) on subordinates’ POS, the direct impact of subordinates’ POS and job stressors from task and rewards on work attitudes(job satisfaction, turnover intention) and safety behaviors(safety compliance and safety participation), and the interaction of subordinates’ POS and <b>job</b> <b>stresses.</b> Analyses are based on the data from interviewing of 20 staff, posts of a Chinese civil aviation Bulletin Board System (BBS) and surveys of 216 subordinates and 42 supervisors from two Chinese civil aviation Air traffic control centers (ATC). The major findings are listed as follows: Firstly, the exchange relationship between supervisors and members has impact on subordinates’ POS by the fully mediating role of subordinates’ perceived supervisor support (PSS). But supervisors’ POS have no impact on subordinates’ POS. Secondly, subordinates’ POS has a direct and positive impact on their job satisfaction and safety behaviors, and a negative impact on turnover intention. Specifically, the higher the employees’ perceived organizational support, the higher job satisfaction and safety behaviors, as well as the lower turnover intention they have. Moreover, POS has stronger relationship with safety participation behaviors than that of safety compliance behaviors. Thirdly, task-related stressor has no significant impact on job satisfaction, turnover intention and safety behaviors. And compensation-related stressor has significant and positive impact on turnover intention and safety behaviors, which means that with the compensation-related stress increases, turnover intention increases, safety behaviors including safety compliance and safety participation also increases. Fourthly, POS and task-related stressor, POS and compensation-related stressor have significant interaction, respectively. Specifically, POS moderates the relationship between task-related stressor and job satisfaction, and between task-related stressor and turnover intention. Moreover, POS also moderates the relationship between compensation-related stressor and safety compliance behaviors. 员工知觉到的组织支持和工作压力都会对员工的工作结果产生影响。尽管目前有关的研究已经取得一定进展，但关于组织支持感对工作绩效的作用、工作压力对工作绩效和工作态度的作用、组织支持感与工作压力两者的交互作用、以及主管对下属的组织支持感的影响等问题还存在很多争议。因此，本研究通过三个研究，探讨了主管的组织支持感、领导-成员交换关系对下属的组织支持感的影响，分析了下属的组织支持感、工作任务、薪酬回报压力对工作态度变量（工作满意感、离职意向）和安全行为的预测作用，以及组织支持感调节薪酬回报压力、工作任务压力与工作结果变量的关系。研究通过对民航业从事管制工作的 20 名人员的访谈、民航专业网站信息的内容分析，以及 216 名普通管制员和 25 名主管的问卷调查，得出的主要结论如下： 第一，在下属组织支持感的影响因素方面，领导-成员交换关系通过下属的主管支持感的完全中介影响下属的组织支持感，而主管的组织支持感对下属的组织支持感没有显著影响。 第二，组织支持感对于工作满意感、离职意向、安全行为分别有显著的直接预测作用。组织支持感越高，工作满意感越高，而离职意向越低，安全遵守行为和安全参与行为也越多，且组织支持感对安全参与行为的预测作用大于对安全遵守行为的预测作用。 第三，工作任务压力对工作满意感、离职意向、安全行为均没有显著的直接作用。薪酬回报压力对离职意向、安全行为均有显著的正向预测作用，具体来说，薪酬回报的压力越大，离职意向越高，安全遵守行为和安全参与行为越多。 第四，组织支持感与工作任务压力、薪酬回报压力存在交互作用。具体来说，组织支持感调节工作任务压力与工作满意感的关系，以及工作任务压力与离职意向的关系；并且调节薪酬回报压力与安全遵守行为的关系...|$|R

It has been proposed that a person-by-environment interaction can be utilized to explain a variety of counterproductive behaviors (Fox and Spector, 1999). For instance, an employee who sabotages another employee's work may do so because of lax supervision (environment) and underlying psychopathology (person) that work in concert to result in the counterproductive behavior.

25|$|Behavioral health {{disorders}} are {{prevalent in the}} United States, but accessing treatment can be challenging. Nearly 1 in 5 adults experience a mental health condition for which approximately only 43% received treatment. When asked about access to mental health treatment, two-thirds of primary care physicians {{reported that they were}} unable to secure outpatient mental health treatment for their patients. This is due, in part, to the workforce shortage in behavioral health. In rural areas, 55% of US counties have no practicing psychiatrist, psychologist, or social worker. Overall, 77% of counties have a severe shortage of mental health workers and 96% of counties had some unmet need. Some {{of the reasons for the}} workforce shortage include high turnover rates, high stress position, and inadequate compensation. Annual turnover rate is 33% for clinicians and 23% for clinical supervisors. This is compared to an annual PCP turnover rate of 7.1%. Compensation in behavioral health field is notably low. The average licensed clinical social worker, a degree that requires master's degree and 2000 hours post graduate experience, earns $45,000/year on average. As a point of reference, the average physical therapist earns $75,000/year on average. Substance abuse counselor earnings are even lower, with an average salary of $34,000/year. <b>Job</b> <b>stress</b> is another factor that may lead to the high turnover rates and workforce shortage. It is estimated that 21-67% of mental health workers experience high levels of burnout including symptoms of emotional exhaustion, high levels of depersonalization and a reduced sense of personal accomplishment. Researchers have offered various recommendations to reduce the critical workforce gaps in behavioral health. Some of these recommendations include the following: expanding loan repayment programs to incentivize mental health providers to serve in underserved (often rural) areas, integrating mental health into primary care, and increasing reimbursement to health care professionals.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Job</b> <b>stress</b> {{results from}} various {{interactions}} {{of the worker}} and {{the environment of the}} work they perform their duties. [...] Location, gender, environment, and many other factors contribute to the buildup of stress. [...] <b>Job</b> <b>stress</b> results from the interaction of the worker and the conditions of work. Views differ on the importance of worker characteristics versus working conditions as the primary cause of <b>job</b> <b>stress.</b> The differing viewpoints suggest different ways to prevent stress at work. Differences in individual characteristics such as personality and coping skills can be very important in predicting whether certain job conditions will result in stress. [...] In other words, what is stressful for one person may not be a problem for someone else. This viewpoint underlies prevention strategies that focus on workers and ways to help them cope with demanding job conditions. In general, occupational stress is caused by a mismatch between perceived effort and perceived reward, and/or a sense of low control in a job with high demands. Low social support at work and job insecurity can also increase occupational stress. Psychosocial stressors are a major cause of occupational stress.|$|E
