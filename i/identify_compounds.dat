40|$|<b>Identifying</b> <b>compounds</b> of {{interest}} for peaks in data generated by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC) is a critical analytical task. Manually <b>identifying</b> <b>compounds</b> is tedious and time-consuming. An alternative is to use pattern matching. Pattern matching <b>identifies</b> <b>compounds</b> by matching previously observed patterns with known peaks to newly observed patterns with unidentified peaks. The fundamental difficulty of pattern matching comes from peak pattern distortions that are caused by differences in data acquisition conditions. This paper investigates peak pattern variations related to varying oven temperature ramp rate and inlet gas pressure and evaluates two types of affine transformations for matching peak patterns. The experimental results suggest that, over the experimental ranges, the changes in temperature ramp rate generate non-linear pattern variations and changes in gas pressure generate nearly linear pattern variations. The results indicate the affine transformations can largely remove the pattern variations {{and can be used}} for applications such as pattern matching and normalizing retention times to retention indices...|$|R

Dempster's research over his career centered on the mass spectrometer and its applications, leading in 1935 to his discovery of the uranium isotope 235U. [...] This isotope's ability to cause a rapidly expanding fission nuclear chain reaction allowed {{the development of the}} atom bomb and nuclear power.

50|$|Since {{there are}} {{thousands}} of chemicals that make up marine DOM, the compounds are therefore, poorly known. Her research group grew two microorganisms together in the lab: a Roseobacter clade bacterium and a photosynthetic diatom. They used changes in gene expression to <b>identify</b> <b>compounds</b> made by the diatom that were then metabolized (eaten) by the bacterium. They identified that the diatom made large amounts of 2,3-dihydroxypropane-1-sulfonate (DHPS), a previously unknown diatom metabolite that was also specifically used by the bacterium as a food source. Moran's group also showed that DHSP was abundant in natural diatom populations and was an actively cycled compound in seawater. This research identified a missing component of the marine carbon and sulfur cycles and will most likely lead to a more detailed understanding of the marine carbon and sulfur cycle.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the field}} of drug discovery, reverse {{pharmacology}} [...] also known as target-based drug discovery (TDD), a hypothesis is first made that modulation of the activity of a specific protein target will have beneficial therapeutic effects. Screening of chemical libraries of small molecules is then used to <b>identify</b> <b>compounds</b> that bind with high affinity to the target. The hits from these screens are then used as starting points for drug discovery. This method became popular after the sequencing {{of the human genome}} which allowed rapid cloning and synthesis of large quantities of purified proteins. This method is the most widely used in drug discovery today. Differently than the classical (forward) pharmacology, with the reverse pharmacology approach in vivo efficacy of identified active (lead) compounds is usually performed in the final drug discovery stages.|$|E
5000|$|Classical {{pharmacology}} {{traditionally has}} been {{the basis for the}} discovery of new drugs. Compounds are screened in cellular or animal models of disease to <b>identify</b> <b>compounds</b> that cause a desirable change in phenotype. Only after the compounds have been discovered, an effort is made to determine the biological target of the compounds. More recently it has become popular to develop a hypothesis that a certain biological target is disease modifying and screen for compounds that modulate the activity of this purified target. Afterwards, these compounds are tested in animals to see if they have the desired effect. This approach is known as [...] "reverse pharmacology" [...] or [...] "target based drug discovery" [...] (TDD). However recent statistically analysis reveals that a disproportionate number of first-in-class drugs with novel mechanisms of action come from phenotypic screening which has led to a resurgence of interest in this method.|$|E

40|$|Scent-marking is {{the most}} {{effective}} method of communication in {{the presence or absence of}} a signaler. These complex mixtures result in a multifaceted interaction triggered by the sense of smell. The objective was to <b>identify</b> volatile organic <b>compound</b> (VOC) composition and odors emitted by total marking fluid (MF) associated with Siberian tigers (Panthera tigris altaica). Siberian tiger, an endangered species, was chosen because its MF had never been analyzed. Solid phase microextraction (SPME) for headspace volatile collection combined with multidimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-olfactometry for simultaneous chemical and sensory analyses were used. Thirty-two VOCs emitted from MF were identified. 2 -acetyl- 1 -pyrroline, the sole previously <b>identified</b> <b>compound</b> responsible for the “characteristic” odor of P. tigris MF, was identified along with two additional compounds confirmed with standards (urea, furfural) and four tentatively <b>identified</b> <b>compounds</b> (3 -methylbutanamine, (R) - 3 -methylcyclopentanone, propanedioic acid, and 3 -hydroxybutanal) as being responsible for the characteristic aroma of Siberian tiger MF. Simultaneous chemical and sensory analyses improved characterization of scent-markings and <b>identified</b> <b>compounds</b> not previously reported in MF of other tiger species. This research will assist animal ecologists, behaviorists, and zookeepers in understanding how scents from specific MF compounds impact tiger and wildlife communication and improve management practices related to animal behavior.
