25|$|In general, {{defining}} {{whether an}} individual is guilty of misconduct requires a detailed investigation by the individual's employing academic institution. Such investigations require detailed and rigorous processes and can be extremely costly. Furthermore, the more senior the individual under suspicion, {{the more likely it}} is that conflicts of <b>interest</b> <b>will</b> compromise the investigation. In many countries (with the notable exception of the United States) acquisition of funds on the basis of fraudulent data is not a legal offence and there is consequently no regulator to oversee investigations into alleged research misconduct. Universities therefore have few incentives to investigate allegations in a robust manner, or act on the findings of such investigations if they vindicate the allegation.|$|E

500|$|In {{some of his}} {{scores from}} the 1920s, {{including}} Daphnis et Chloé, Ravel frequently divides his upper strings, having them play in six to eight parts while the woodwind are required to play with extreme agility. His writing for the brass ranges from softly muted to triple-forte outbursts at climactic points. In the 1930s he tended to simplify his orchestral textures. The lighter tone of the G major Piano Concerto follows the models of Mozart and Saint-Saëns, alongside use of jazz-like themes. The critics Edward Sackville-West and Desmond Shawe-Taylor comment that in the slow movement, [...] "one {{of the most beautiful}} tunes Ravel ever invented", the composer [...] "can truly be said to join hands with Mozart". The most popular of Ravel's orchestral works, Boléro (1928), was conceived several years before its completion; in 1924 {{he said that he was}} contemplating [...] "a symphonic poem without a subject, where the whole <b>interest</b> <b>will</b> be in the rhythm".|$|E

2500|$|Sucrose {{gradient}} centrifugation [...] {{a linear}} concentration gradient of sugar (typically sucrose, glycerol, or a silica based density gradient media, like Percoll) is generated in a tube {{such that the}} highest concentration is {{on the bottom and}} lowest on top. Percoll is a trademark owned by GE Healthcare companies. A protein sample is then layered on top of the gradient and spun at high speeds in an ultracentrifuge. This causes heavy macromolecules to migrate towards the bottom of the tube faster than lighter material. [...] During centrifugation in the absence of sucrose, as particles move farther and farther from the center of rotation, they experience more and more centrifugal force (the further they move, the faster they move). [...] The problem with this is that the useful separation range of within the vessel is restricted to a small observable window. [...] Spinning a sample twice as long doesn't mean the particle of <b>interest</b> <b>will</b> go twice as far, in fact, it will go significantly further. [...] However, when the proteins are moving through a sucrose gradient, they encounter liquid of increasing density and viscosity. [...] A properly designed sucrose gradient will counteract the increasing centrifugal force so the particles move in close proportion to the time {{they have been in the}} centrifugal field. [...] Samples separated by these gradients are referred to as [...] "rate zonal" [...] centrifugations. [...] After separating the protein/particles, the gradient is then fractionated and collected.|$|E
2500|$|The fertile octogenarian is {{a fictitious}} {{character}} {{that comes up}} when applying the rule against perpetuities.

[...] A is, at the time the will is probated, an 85-year-old woman.

2500|$|In August 2011, a {{video was}} leaked {{containing}} footage of Silas supposedly preparing to attack Theresa McQueen (Jorgie Porter) at a night-time rave.

It was then revealed that Silas would feature in the fourth series of the Hollyoaks late-night spin-off, Hollyoaks Later. It was confirmed that Silas would line Theresa up as his next victim. Porter said it was [...] "amazing" [...] {{to be involved in}} the storyline. The storyline begins when Theresa's aunt, Myra McQueen (Nicole Barber-Lane), inappropriately touches Silas and blames it on Theresa. This puts Theresa in danger as Silas targets girls who he is unhappy with because of their behaviour. Silas hates girls who are promiscuous and Porter opined that Theresa is [...] "probably a prime suspect" [...] as she enjoys receiving men's attention. Theresa signs up for an online dating website as she wants to find love. Theresa's love <b>interest,</b> <b>Will</b> Savage (James Atherton), learns of this and talks to Silas about it. Porter stated that Silas is being [...] "clever" [...] as he befriends Will while plotting against Theresa. Silas encourages Will to set up a fake profile on the website to check on Theresa. Will creates an online alter ego named Juan which Silas is involved with. Theresa makes contact with the profile online, not realising she is putting herself in danger. Porter said that it [...] "scary and worrying" [...] but would not confirm whether Silas kills Theresa. Hollyoaks series producer, Emma Smithwick, confirmed that the spin-off would feature the death of a regular character.|$|E

In a model where signallers may inform receivers as to the value of a binary random variable, if signalling is favoured at all, then signallers will always use the cheapest and the second-cheapest signal available. Costly signalling arms races do not get started. A more complex evolutionary simulation was constructed, featurin [...] ...|$|R
