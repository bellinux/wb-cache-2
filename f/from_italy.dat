5|$|Leicester {{also built}} a loggia, or open gallery, beside the great keep {{to lead to}} the new formal gardens.

5|$|Renaissance trends <b>from</b> <b>Italy</b> and Central Europe {{influenced}} Russia in many ways. Their {{influence was}} rather limited, however, {{due to the}} large distances between Russia and the main European cultural centers and the strong adherence of Russians to their Orthodox traditions and Byzantine legacy.|$|E

5|$|The art of mother-of-pearl carving {{is said to}} {{have been}} a Bethlehem {{tradition}} since the 15th century when it was introduced by Franciscan friars <b>from</b> <b>Italy.</b> A constant stream of pilgrims generated a demand for these items, which also provided jobs for women. The industry was noted by Richard Pococke, who visited Bethlehem in 1727.|$|E
5|$|After a {{year away}} from the bike, Marchant {{returned}} to cycling and turned professional in 1958. Within a year he left for Europe with Ron Murray and Alan McLellan on the professional racing circuit. The trip was unsuccessful. The group did not take their track bikes with them, with Marchant ordering one <b>from</b> <b>Italy.</b> The equipment never arrived and he competed in Belgium and Copenhagen on borrowed bikes. Marchant only displayed glimpses of his ability, defeating the Italian champion in one outing and also winning the La Trobe race in Tasmania. Marchant then retired in 1961.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} <b>from</b> <b>Italy,</b> No. 3 Commando {{became part}} of the 1st Special Service Brigade, commanded by Brigadier The Lord Lovat. It marked the end of the unit's independence, as from then {{they were part of a}} larger organisation, and the role of the Commandos had evolved from small scale raiding and precision operations, to more large scale operations in which they were mainly used as highly trained infantry assault units.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the issues}} the Dutch {{designers}} were having with a propulsion system were discussed, the delegation came away <b>from</b> <b>Italy</b> entirely uninspired by the Italians' efforts in that area. On the other hand, the visit provoked a drastic reworking {{of the internal}} subdivision of the proposed battlecruisers. The designers {{got rid of the}} previously required central longitudinal bulkhead and attempted to raise the double bottom to provide greater protection against magnetic torpedoes. However, due to the requirement for a shallow draft, this modification had to be abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Ark Royal {{was pressed}} into service, {{delivering}} aircraft to Malta during several supply runs throughout June and July, and escorting the convoys of Operation Substance in July and Operation Halberd in September. Despite some losses, the convoys succeeded in keeping Malta supplied and fighting. The continued Allied presence in Malta was a considerable problem for Rommel in Africa, who was losing {{as much as}} ⅓ of his supplies <b>from</b> <b>Italy</b> to submarines and bombers based there. Adolf Hitler decided to send a flotilla of U-boats into the Mediterranean to attack Allied shipping, {{against the advice of}} Großadmiral Raeder.|$|E

5|$|Ciao Italia: Live <b>from</b> <b>Italy</b> (credited as Madonna: Ciao, Italia! Live <b>from</b> <b>Italy</b> in {{the video}} sequence) is a video album by American singer-songwriter Madonna and was {{released}} by Warner Reprise Video and Sire Records on May 24, 1988. It contained footage from a previous TV special of the Who's That Girl World Tour, Madonna in Concerto, broadcast in Europe in 1987, filmed at the Stadio Comunale in Turin, Italy. The video release also contained footage from shows recorded in Florence, Italy and Tokyo, Japan, the latter having previously been released as a Japanese TV special and home video release, Who's That Girl: Live in Japan. The decision to release Ciao Italia was spurred {{by the fact that}} this previous release became a commercial success in Japan. A re-release of the video took place in 1999, when it was released in DVD format, with a stereo soundtrack containing the songs only.|$|E
5|$|Despite early victories, Pyrrhus {{found his}} {{position}} in Italy untenable. Rome steadfastly refused to negotiate with Pyrrhus {{as long as his}} army remained in Italy. Facing unacceptably heavy losses from each encounter with the Roman army, Pyrrhus withdrew from the peninsula. In 275 BC, Pyrrhus again met the Roman army at the Battle of Beneventum. While Beneventum was indecisive, Pyrrhus realised his army had been exhausted and reduced by years of foreign campaigns. Seeing little hope for further gains, he withdrew completely <b>from</b> <b>Italy.</b>|$|E
5|$|He {{was finally}} able {{to gain access to the}} Adriatic by {{capturing}} Lissus and its seemingly impregnable citadel, after which the surrounding territories surrendered. Perhaps the capture of Lissus rekindled in Philip hopes of an Italian invasion. However the loss of his fleet meant that Philip would be dependent on Carthage for passage to and <b>from</b> <b>Italy,</b> making the prospect of invasion considerably less appealing.|$|E
