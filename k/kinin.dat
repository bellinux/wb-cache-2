Glutamyl endopeptidase can inhibit the activation of targets within the complement system. It is indicated to cause inhibition to all three pathways of complement activation.|$|E
25|$|Simultaneously, excess {{circulating}} thrombin {{assists in}} {{the conversion of}} plasminogen to plasmin, resulting in fibrinolysis. The breakdown of clots results in an excess of FDPs, which have powerful anticoagulant properties, contributing to hemorrhage. The excess plasmin also activates the complement and <b>kinin</b> systems. Activation of these systems leads {{to many of the}} clinical symptoms that patients experiencing DIC exhibit, such as shock, hypotension, and increased vascular permeability. The acute form of DIC is considered an extreme expression of the intravascular coagulation process with a complete breakdown of the normal homeostatic boundaries. DIC is associated with a poor prognosis and a high mortality rate.|$|E

40|$|Under {{suitable}} conditions, polypeptides {{which can}} evoke {{elements of the}} inflammatory reaction appear in mammalian plasma or inflammatory exudates. These polypeptides, the plasma <b>kinins,</b> increase vascular permeability, contract smooth muscle, dilate blood vessels, initiate leukocytic infiltration, and provoke pain (1). The <b>kinins</b> are derived from a protein precursor, prokinin or kininogen. Several groups of investigators {{have pointed out that}} plasmin, the proteolytic enzyme or enzymes of plasma which can digest many substrates at neutrality, can induce the formation of <b>kinins,</b> either directly or through an action upon kallikreinogen (2 - 8). The presence of <b>kinins</b> was recognized by their ability to contract smooth muscles or dilate blood vessels. Curiously, it has not been possible to demonstrate that plasmin increases vascular permeability, one of the properties attributed to <b>kinins</b> (9 - 11).

40|$|A {{comparison}} of solution conformations of active, restricted-conformation analogues of two sequence-similar insect/vertebrate neuropeptide family pairs {{shed light on}} the potential existence of molecular evolutionary relationships. Analogues of the locustatachykins and the mammalian tachykinin substance P, containing a sterically hindered Aib-NMePhe/Tyr residue block, share similar low-energy turn conformations incorporating a cis peptide bond. Conversely, restricted conformation analogues of the insect <b>kinins</b> and the mammalian opiate peptide Tyr-W-MIF- 1, with near identical C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, adopt different conformations, The insect <b>kinins</b> adopt a cisPro 1 - 4 beta-turn, in which the Phe(1) is critical for bioactivity. Tyr-W-MIF- 1 prefers a transPro 2 - 5 turn, and an additional N-terminal Phe severely inhibits mu-opiate receptor binding. Comparisons of the chemical/conformational requirements for receptor interaction are consistent with a distant evolutionary relationship between the insectatachykinins and tachykinins, but not between the insect <b>kinins</b> and Tyr-W-MIF- 1. Therefore, analogues of the insect <b>kinins</b> with pest control potential can be readily designed to avoid mammalian interactions. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The kallikrein-kinin {{system is}} an {{endogenous}} metabolic cascade, triggering of {{which results in}} the release of vasoactive <b>kinins</b> (bradykinin-related peptides). This complex system includes the precursors of <b>kinins</b> known as kininogens and mainly tissue and plasma kallikreins. The pharmacologically active <b>kinins,</b> which are often considered as either proinflammatory or cardioprotective, are implicated in many physiological and pathological processes. The interest of the various components of this multi-protein system is explained {{in part by the}} multiplicity of its pharmacological activities, mediated not only by <b>kinins</b> and their receptors, but also by their precursors and their activators and the metal lopeptidases and the antiproteases that limit their activities. The regulation of this system by serpins and the wide distribution of the different constituents add to the complexity of this system, as well as its multiple relationships with other important metabolic pathways such as the renin-angiotensin, coagulation, or complement pathways. The purpose of this review is to summarize the main properties of this kallikrein-kinin system and to address the multiple pharmacological interventions that modulate the functions of this system, restraining its proinflammatory effects or potentiating its cardiovascular properties.

Upon DEAE-Sepharose chromatography of the Sephacryl peaks, K-I activity {{was found in the}} nonadsorbed fraction and formed <b>kinins</b> only from heated plasma. Peak K-H activity was resolved into two peaks, IC-ha (in the nonadsorbed fraction), which formed <b>kinins</b> only from heated plasma, and K-IIb (in the adsorbed fraction), which formed <b>kinins</b> from both heated plasma and LMW bovine kininogen. K-III kin-inogenase activity appeared at the same position as K-IIb and also formed <b>kinins</b> from both substrates. Kininogenases K-I and K-IIa had the same Km value (0. 3 mM) with Pro-Phe-Arg-p-nitroanilide(pNA), similar to that found with human plasma kallikrein.

Like plasma kallikrein, K-I and K-IIa were inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor, but only weakly by aprotinin. In addition the kininogenase activity of both K-I and K-IIa was neutralized by adding antihuman prekallikrein immunoglobulin G (IgG). in contrast, K-IIb and K-Ill were strongly inhibited by aprotinin but not by soybean trypsin inhibitor, consistent with their being tissue kallikreins.
