40|$|A {{steady-state}} {{and laser}} flash photolysis (LFP) {{study of the}} TPPBF 4 -photosensitized oxidation of ring-methoxylated benzyl alcohols has been carried out. Direct evidence on the involvement of intermediate benzyl alcohol radical cations and benzylic cations in these reactions has been provided through LFP experiments.

This behavior has been rationalized in terms of the interplay between the stabilities of benzyl alcohol radical cations and benzyl cations involved in these processes. A general mechanism for the TPPBF 4 -photosensitized reactions of ring-methoxylated benzyl alcohols has been proposed, where the a-OH group of the parent substrate acts as the deprotonating base promoting Î±-C-H deprotonation of the benzyl alcohol radical cation (formed after electron transfer from the benzyl alcohol to TPP*) to give a benzyl radical and a protonated benzyl alcohol, precursor of the benzylic cation.

40|$|Modified biphenols {{which contain}} 2, 2 $ sp prime$-disubstituents on the {{biphenyl}} groups and also hydroquinones containing multiple substituents were synthesized {{in order to}} prepare novel thermally stable polymers. The structure/properties relationship which were investigated using viscometry, DSC, TG/DTA, TMA, and GPC are discussed. The prepared polymers (polysulfones and poly(ether ketone) s) exhibit considerably enhanced glass transition temperatures and are soluble in common organic solvents due to the noncoplanar biphenyl rings which increase the disorder along the polymer backbone thereby reducing interchain interactions. The polyesters prepared show poor solubility and their Tg's and Tm's increase considerably over the unhindered polyester analogs due to the chain stiffness. Polyimides were prepared from the reaction of novel dianhydrides and m- and p-phenylene diamines. A series of bisanhydrides were prepared via the nitro-displacement reaction of hindered biphenols and N-methyl- 4 -nitrophthalimide.

40|$|Results of {{our model}} {{compound}} {{studies suggest that}} free radical hydrogen transfer pathways from the catalyst to the alkylarene {{are responsible for the}} scission of strong carbon-carbon bonds. There are two requisites for the observed selective bond scission. First is the stability of the ipso adduct precursor leading to displacement, the more stable the adduct the more probable bond scission. This explains why benzyl radical displacement > phenoxy radical displacement in benzyldiphenyl ether and explains why PhCH{sub 2 }CH{sub 2 }PhCH{sub 2 } radical > naphthylmethyl radical from NMBB. Second, given equal ipso adduct precursor stabilities, e. g. methyldiphenylmethane, the stability of the departing radical determines the selectivity. this explains benzyl radical > methyl radical in the methylated <b>diphenylmethanes</b> and explains why {alpha}-hydroxyphenethyl radical > methyl radical in 1, 2 -ditolylethanol. We have assumed little physical interaction between the molecules and the catalytic surface and have been able to satisfactorily explain most of the observed selectivity. However, for NMBB we expect a higher selectivity for -A- bond scission relative to -B- bond scission, given the ca. 6 kcal/mol difference between the radical adduct formed by the hydrogen atom addition to 1 -methylnaphthalene and p-xylene. It is possible that physical properties play a role in lowering the selectivity in -B- bond scission. Also, catalysts prepared by other methods may contain different activity sites and operate by different mechanisms...|$|R

Both substances were also found to inhibit syncytium formation when MOLT- 4 cells were cocultured with HIV- 2 -infected HUT- 78 cells, but were inactive in this assay against HIV- 1 -infected cells. When observed, the activity is generally moderate in degree of protection and requires concentrations in the 10 (- 4) molar range. In contrast to ATA, both of these substances were inactive when tested for prevention of the binding of the OKT 4 A monoclonal antibody to the CD 4 receptor and also for inhibition of HIV- 1 reverse transcriptase. These substances therefore appear act by a mechanism that is distinct from that of polymeric ATA. Several active and inactive structural analogues of 3 and 5 were also synthesized.
