5|$|As of 1999, the State Department {{was paying}} $360,000 {{per year to}} lease the suite on a rolling basis; the lease is renewed every ten years with an {{optional}} one or two year short-term extension. In 2015, it was announced the State Department would no longer permit staff to be housed at the Waldorf-Astoria, due to security concerns arising <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> purchase of the property by Chinese business interests.

None of the employees care to join him, much to the disappointment of Michael, who plays music through the ventilation system to try tempting them to come.|$|E
5|$|During 1645 the Royalist {{military}} cause largely collapsed, and Colonel Robert Blake led a Parliamentary {{force against}} Dunster in October. In November Blake began his siege of the castle, setting up his artillery in Dunster village {{and starting to}} dig tunnels to plant mines beneath the walls. The castle was briefly relieved by reinforcements in February 1646, but the siege was resumed and by April the Royalists situation was untenable– an honourable surrender was negotiated and a Parliamentary garrison installed. After {{the end of the}} Second English Civil War in 1649, however, Parliament decided to deliberately destroy, or slight, the defences of castles in key Royalist areas, including the south-west. In the case of Dunster, Thomas's son George Luttrell was able to convince the authorities to destroy only the medieval defensive walls, rather than the entire castle, leaving Dunster damaged <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> siege but still habitable; the walls were demolished over 12 days in August 1650 by a team of 300 workmen. The only parts of the medieval walls to survive were the Great Gatehouse and the bases of the two towers in the Lower Ward.|$|E

5|$|In November, Lyn {{stated that}} they wanted to {{purchases}} the shares in Ullevaal from NFF, who {{stated that they}} were now worth NOK10 million. NFF also raised questions if it was actually Lyn or the newly created limited company who were actually going to buy the shares. NFF stated that they were opposed to anyone but the federation and clubs owning the national stadium and that they were opposed to private investors. The federation hoped to use the high incomes generated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> success of the national team, including from participation in the 1994 FIFA World Cup, to allow the stadium company to charge high rent for the international matches and Cup Finals, thus quickly eliminating the stadium's debt. NFF felt it was unfair that they were in practice subsidizing Lyn by not having similar rent increases for the club, and that this should be reflected in the share value. In March 1994, Lyn sued NFF for the right to purchase the shares for NOK4.4 million plus interest.|$|E
5|$|The Heiress {{had been}} a Broadway play before it was a film. Richardson so liked his part {{that he decided to}} play it in the West End, with Ashcroft as Sloper's {{daughter}} Catherine. The piece was to open in February 1949 at Richardson's favourite theatre, the Haymarket. Rehearsals were chaotic. Burrell, whom Richardson had asked to direct, was not up to the task – possibly, Miller speculates, because of nervous exhaustion <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> traumas at the Old Vic. With only a week to go before the first performance, the producer, Binkie Beaumont, asked him to stand down, and Gielgud was recruited in his place. Matters improved astonishingly; the production was a complete success and ran in London for 644 performances.|$|E
5|$|As the 1936 season began, Hammond {{remained}} weak <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> {{removal of}} his tonsils. Returning to cricket too soon, {{he was in}} poor form; he took a longer rest, which caused him to miss {{the first of three}} Tests against India. It was July before he felt fully well. In all first-class cricket that season, Hammond scored 2,107 runs, averaging 56.94, and took 41 wickets. In county cricket, Gloucestershire appointed a new captain, Dallas Page. Hammond had been offered the joint captaincy with Bev Lyon, conditional on his becoming assistant secretary at the club to enable him to play as an amateur, but declined for financial reasons. Hammond returned to the England side for the second Test, making 167, his first century in 28 innings, scoring quickly throughout. He was praised by Wisden for his control. Hammond continued to score heavily in the third Test, making 217 after being dropped twice early on. His highest score came in the last county match of the season, at Gloucestershire, which was Tom Goddard's benefit match. A difficult pitch meant that wickets tumbled on the first day, prompting fears of an early finish which would possibly lose money for Goddard. Hammond batted all of the second day, ensuring the match lasted the full three days, to score 317 {{out of a total of}} 485.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} fifteen years, Grannvale expands to hold {{dominion}} {{over the whole}} of Judgral, and Arvis turns Grannvale into an empire and styles himself emperor. He and Deirdre have twin children: Julius, the scion of Loptyr, and Julia, the scion of Naga. Manfroy uses the Loptyr tome to corrupt Julius and turn him into Loptyr's vessel, and Deirdre sacrifices herself to send Julia into hiding. Julius overthrows his father and turns the Empire into a tyrannical regime. At this point, Seliph comes out of hiding to protect a nearby village, revealing his long-hidden existence to Grannvale. Traveling across the lands of Jugdral, Seliph reunites with the long-hidden children of Sigurd's companions, including Julia. Making {{his way through the}} countries of Jugdral, he gains support from the surviving powers, and gradually frees Grannvale's conquered territories. Arvis is powerless to subvert his son's rule, and is killed in battle against Seliph. During the course of these battles, Julia is captured and Manfroy and Julius attempt to sacrifice her as her powers could banish Loptyr for good. Seliph manages to save her, and after defeating Manfroy and Julius in battle, Julia successfully banishes Loptyr, ending his rule for good and allowing Jugdral to recover <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> conflicts. Seliph takes his rightful place on the throne as the emperor of Grannvale, and restores power to the surrounding countries with their respective heirs.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the poem}} {{describes}} Hindu myth it is {{heavily influenced by}} Zoroastrian theology, and the ideal of a dualistic moral system.
