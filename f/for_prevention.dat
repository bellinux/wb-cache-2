5|$|Complicating the use {{of aspirin}} <b>for</b> <b>prevention</b> is the {{phenomenon}} of aspirin resistance. For people who are resistant, aspirin's efficacy is reduced. Some authors have suggested testing regimens to identify people who are resistant to aspirin.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{appears to}} offer little benefit to those at {{lower risk of}} heart attack or stroke—for instance, those without a history of these events or with {{pre-existing}} disease. Some studies recommend aspirin on a case-by-case basis, while others have suggested the risks of other events, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, were enough to outweigh any potential benefit, and recommended against using aspirin for primary prevention entirely. Aspirin has also been suggested as a component of a polypill <b>for</b> <b>prevention</b> of cardiovascular disease.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate revision of local plan <b>for</b> disaster <b>preventions</b> and countermeasures of the voluntary organizations <b>for</b> disaster <b>prevention</b> after the threatening disaster in Kagoshima due to heavy rainfall on August 6, 1993. Revision of local plan <b>for</b> disaster <b>prevention</b> in Kogoshima city was investigated by interviews. A questionaire survey was undertaken to study the behaviors and consciousness of the presidents of the voluntary organizations <b>for</b> disaster <b>prevention</b> in Kagoshima city. The systems for dissemination of information and the evacuation of inhabitants, and countermeasures of the voluntary organizations <b>for</b> disaster <b>prevention</b> are discussed. The new systems for dissemination of information and the evacuation of inhabitants are rated high by the voluntary organizations <b>for</b> disaster <b>prevention.</b> However, activities of voluntary organizations <b>for</b> disaster <b>prevention</b> have somewhat improved. Supports of administration are neceesary to activate their activities...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Design the {{structure}} of the vehicle system <b>for</b> overturning <b>prevention</b> and set up the system dynamic model. Based on the Matlab/Simulink, establish the dynamic simulation system of the vehicle system <b>for</b> overturning <b>prevention</b> <b>for</b> the Chery A 3 car. Using the brake / drive integrated ESP control principle, based on the simulation model, respectively simulate and analyze the ESP control performances of the vehicle system and the vehicle system <b>for</b> overturning <b>prevention</b> on different simulation conditions. The study results indicate that when there is no ESP control or ESP control system failure, the vehicle system <b>for</b> overturning <b>prevention</b> can simulate the ESP control performances of the vehicle system effectively, the ESP control performances of the vehicle system and the vehicle system <b>for</b> overturning <b>prevention</b> have remarkable consistency. The theory of the vehicle system <b>for</b> overturning <b>prevention</b> <b>for</b> the ESP control performances test provides a basis for the vehicle stability control performance research. ...|$|R

5|$|From January to April 2009, the Scottish Government {{conducted}} a trial translocation of Eurasian sparrowhawks from around racing pigeon lofts in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Kilmarnock, Stirling and Dumfries. The trial, which cost £25,000, {{was supported by}} the Scottish Homing Union, representing the country's 3,500 pigeon fanciers. The experiment was originally scheduled for early in 2008 but was postponed because it would have impinged on the birds' breeding season. It was criticised by the government's own ecological adviser, Dr Ian Bainbridge, the government body Scottish Natural Heritage and organisations including the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the Scottish Society <b>for</b> <b>Prevention</b> of Cruelty to Animals.|$|E

5|$|The initial aim of {{treatment}} is {{to settle the}} symptoms of an acute attack. Repeated attacks can be prevented by medications that reduce serum uric acid levels. Tentative evidence supports the application of ice for 20 to 30 minutes {{several times a day}} to decrease pain. Options for acute treatment include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine and steroids. While steroids and NSAIDs work equally well, steroids may be safer. Options <b>for</b> <b>prevention</b> include allopurinol, febuxostat, and probenecid. Lowering uric acid levels can cure the disease. Treatment of associated health problems is also important. Lifestyle interventions have been poorly studied. It is unclear whether dietary supplements have an effect in people with gout.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of calcium}} channel blockers, {{thought to be}} able to prevent the spasm of blood vessels by {{preventing}} calcium from entering smooth muscle cells, has been proposed <b>for</b> <b>prevention.</b> The calcium channel blocker nimodipine when taken by mouth improves outcome if given between the fourth and twenty-first day after the bleeding, even if it does not reduce the amount of vasospasm detected on angiography. In traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, nimodipine does not affect long-term outcome, and is not recommended. Other calcium channel blockers and magnesium sulfate have been studied, but are not presently recommended; neither is there any evidence that shows benefit if nimodipine is given intravenously.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{identify}} the difficulties <b>for</b> the <b>prevention</b> {{of prostate cancer}} and to describe strategies <b>for</b> the <b>prevention</b> of prostate cancer. Method: Exploratory, qualitative and bibliographic research {{carried out in the}} Nursing Database (BDENF) and in the Latin-American and Caribbean Literature in Health Sciences (LILACS). After pre-reading and selective reading, were selected 8 potential bibliographies. Results: After interpretative and thematic analysis, three categories emerged: Politics and organizational difficulties <b>for</b> the <b>prevention</b> of prostate cancer, Sociocultural difficulties <b>for</b> the <b>prevention</b> of prostate cancer and Strategies <b>for</b> the <b>prevention</b> of prostate cancer. Conclusion: The strategies must have as its focus the politics and the organization of services, to coadunate with the National Politics, {{as well as with the}} social and cultural reality of men. The educational activities can contribute to minimize such difficulties, diminishing the prejudices and increasing the male adhesion in the health services <b>for</b> the <b>prevention</b> of prostate cancer...|$|R

25|$|A {{diphtheria}} {{vaccine is}} effective <b>for</b> <b>prevention</b> and {{available in a}} number of formulations. Three or four doses, given along with tetanus vaccine and pertussis vaccine, are recommended during childhood. Further doses are recommended every ten years. Protection can be verified by measuring the antitoxin level in the blood. Treatment is with the antibiotics erythromycin or benzylpenicillin. These antibiotics may also be used <b>for</b> <b>prevention</b> in those who have been exposed to the infection. A surgical procedure known as a tracheotomy is sometimes needed to open the airway in severe cases.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Given the {{substantially}} increasing geriatric population, {{the need}} for evidence-based strategies to address the medical and societal consequences of these demographic trends has never been greater. In this context, statins <b>for</b> primary <b>prevention</b> of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) provide substantial potential social value by improving health and survival. However, using statins <b>for</b> primary <b>prevention</b> in older adults presents a clinical dilemma. Even though compelling evidence exists supporting statins <b>for</b> secondary <b>prevention</b> in individuals older than 75 years with clinical ASCVD, the same cannot be said <b>for</b> primary <b>prevention.</b> In this Viewpoint, we describe existing evidence {{on the benefits of}} statins <b>for</b> primary <b>prevention</b> in older adults, uncertainties about risks, and {{the need for}} a randomized trial before non–evidence-based prescribing patterns become irreversibly incorporated into practice...|$|R
