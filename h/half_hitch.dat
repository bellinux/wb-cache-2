2500|$|This is {{the form}} most {{commonly}} used for aircraft tie-down. [...] One taut-line hitch is tied 15–30cm from the aircraft and adjusted for tension, then a second taut-line hitch is tied 5–20cm further from the aircraft and finished with a half-hitch. [...] Wind-induced lift tends to pull the knot tighter, gust-induced oscillations tend to damp-out, and once the <b>half</b> <b>hitch</b> is undone, pushing the lower working rope up easily releases both hitches even amid icing.|$|E
60|$|The {{weight of}} the animal dragged me forward and, had I not taken a <b>half</b> <b>hitch</b> round a dead snag, would have lifted me off my feet or pulled the lasso from my hands. As it was, the choking lion, now within reach of the furious, leaping hounds, swung to and fro before my face. He could not see me, but his frantic lunges {{narrowly}} missed me.|$|E
60|$|The boy {{was on the}} ground. His {{left hand}} grasped the heavy mane; his right arm lay across the beast's withers and his right hand drew {{steadily}} in upon a halter rope with which {{he had taken a}} <b>half</b> <b>hitch</b> about the horse's muzzle. Now the black reared and wheeled, striking and biting, full upon the youth, but the active figure swung with him--always just behind the giant shoulder--and ever and ever he drew the great arched neck farther and farther to the right.|$|E
50|$|The Water Bowline can be tied {{very quickly}} by {{throwing}} two <b>half</b> <b>hitches</b> over the working end and then running the working end around the standing line and back through both <b>half</b> <b>hitches.</b> This {{is illustrated in}} the three pictures below.|$|R
5000|$|The {{buntline}} hitch, when bent to a yard, makes a {{more secure}} knot than two <b>half</b> <b>hitches,</b> but is more liable to jam. It differs from two <b>half</b> <b>hitches</b> in that the second half hitchis inside instead of outside the first one. The Ashley Book of Knots ...|$|R
5000|$|Two <b>half</b> <b>hitches</b> is the commonest of all hitches for mooring in {{particular}} and also for general utility. Steel gives the name in 1794. The difference between two <b>half</b> <b>hitches</b> and the clove hitch is that the former, after a single turn around a spar, is made fast around its own standing part, while the latter is tied directly around the spar. The Ashley Book of Knots ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he answered, {{with his}} hand to his head; [...] "some such thought was in my mind this {{afternoon}} when I heard of your riding. Stay! I have it! I was at Ampthill, Ossory's place, just before I left. Some insupportable coxcomb was boasting a marvellous run with the hounds nigh across Hertfordshire, and Miss Manners brought him up with a round turn and a <b>half</b> <b>hitch</b> by relating one of your exploits, Richard Carvel. And take my word on't she got no small applause. She told how you had followed a fox over one of your rough provincial counties, which means three of Hertfordshire, with your arm broken, by Heaven! and how they lifted you off at the death. And, Mr. Carvel," [...] said my Lord, generously, looking at my flushed face, [...] "you must give me your hand for that." ...|$|E

50|$|One {{instance}} where a <b>half</b> <b>hitch</b> {{stands on}} its own without additional embellishment is when added to a timber hitch to help stabilize a load {{in the direction of}} pull. A timber hitch is tied on {{the far end of the}} load to bind it securely and a <b>half</b> <b>hitch</b> made at the forward end to serve as a guide for the rope. In this instance, the <b>half</b> <b>hitch</b> combined with a timber hitch is known as a killick hitch or kelleg hitch.|$|E

50|$|The {{round turn}} and two <b>half</b> <b>hitches</b> is a hitch used {{to secure the}} end of a rope to a fixed object. The name refers to the {{components}} used to form the knot: a round turn wraps the rope around the object (completely encircling it) and the two <b>half</b> <b>hitches</b> secure the end around the standing part. Variations of this hitch can be made with differing numbers of turns and half-hitches; an example is illustrated below.|$|R

50|$|French {{whipping}} is a whipping knot {{that consists}} {{of a series of}} <b>half</b> <b>hitches.</b> It is used to stop unraveling of rope ends as well as to provide a grip over railings.|$|R
50|$|The {{sizes of}} the two loops can also be fixed by making <b>half</b> <b>hitches</b> with each end over the necks of the loops. This {{configuration}} {{is known as the}} fireman's chair knot.|$|R

50|$|One {{member of}} the ground crew ties the whip block tail to the shot line. The coxswain signals the tower, and the tower returns the affirmative signal. The tower then hauls the whip up {{to them on the}} shot line, and ties the whip block tail to the mast with a round turn and two <b>half</b> <b>hitches.</b> The tower signals to the coxswain who returns the signal. The ground crew {{attaches}} the high line through the chair to the endless whip and raises the high line to the tower. Once the high line reaches the tower, it is attached to the mast with a round turn and two <b>half</b> <b>hitches</b> and a signal is passed to the coxswain.|$|R

60|$|The boy {{did as he}} was bid, {{placing his}} hands behind him when Paulvitch told him to do so. Instantly the old man slipped the running noose over one of the lad's wrists, took a couple of <b>half</b> <b>hitches</b> about his other wrist, and knotted the cord.|$|R
50|$|Once tight, the trucker's hitch {{is often}} secured with a <b>half</b> <b>hitch,</b> usually slipped for easy {{releasing}} {{and to avoid}} the necessity {{of access to the}} end of the rope, though a more secure finish, such as two half-hitches, may be called for. Under large loads, the finishing <b>half</b> <b>hitch</b> can jam, especially if it is not slipped; the difficulty of releasing it can be compounded by the fact that the knot is typically still under tension when it is untied.|$|E

50|$|The {{shoelace}} knot is a doubly slipped {{reef knot}} formed by joining {{the ends of}} whatever is being tied with a <b>half</b> <b>hitch,</b> folding each of the exposed ends into a loop (bight) and joining the loops with a second <b>half</b> <b>hitch.</b> The size of the loops {{and the length of}} the exposed ends are adjusted when the knot is tied. It has the stability of the reef knot but is significantly easier to untie, simply by pulling the ends away {{from the center of the}} knot.|$|E
50|$|Cavandoli macramé is one {{variety that}} is used to form {{geometric}} and free-form patterns like weaving. The Cavandoli style is done mainly in a single knot, the double half-hitch knot. Reverse <b>half</b> <b>hitches</b> are sometimes used to maintain balance when working left and right halves of a balanced piece.|$|R
5000|$|The primary {{knots of}} Macramé are the square knot (a {{variant of the}} reef knot) and forms of [...] "hitching": various {{combinations}} of <b>half</b> <b>hitches.</b> It was long crafted by sailors, especially in elaborate or ornamental knotting forms, to decorate anything from knife handles to bottles to parts of ships.|$|R
50|$|Bullwhips {{are usually}} {{measured}} from {{the butt of}} the handle {{to the end of the}} plaiting of the thong. The thong typically terminates at a fall hitch—a series of <b>half</b> <b>hitches</b> that neatly tie the replaceable fall (or tail) to the whip. Whips range in length from 3 ft to very long bullwhips of 20 ft with some examples being even longer.|$|R
