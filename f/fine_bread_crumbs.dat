40|$|The present {{paper is}} focused on {{rheology}} dough properties of winter wheat cultivars in relation to <b>bread</b> <b>crumb</b> properties. The rheological characteristics of wheat fl our were evaluated by using Farinograph and Extensograph tests. The image analysis for <b>bread</b> <b>crumb</b> grain assessment was applied as alternative technique for more rapid and efficient measurement of bread characteristics. The highest significant positive correlation (P< 0. 05) was found between <b>bread</b> <b>crumb</b> properties and extensographic parameters: dough energy, maximum dough resistance and resistance to extensibility ratio. Cultivars ‘Klara’, ‘Barbara’, ‘Žitarka’ and ‘Golubica’ have shown <b>finer</b> and uniform <b>bread</b> <b>crumbs</b> with regard to optimal dough physicochemical characteristics...|$|R

In this article, multifractal analysis, employing the multifractal spectrum (MFS), {{has been applied to}} study the structure of the <b>bread</b> <b>crumb</b> in four varieties of bread (baguette, sliced, bran, and sandwich). The computed spectrum can be used to discriminate among <b>bread</b> <b>crumbs</b> from different types. Also, high correlations were found between some of these parameters and the porosity, coarseness, and heterogeneity of the samples. These results demonstrate that the MFS is an appropriate tool for characterising the internal structure of the <b>bread</b> <b>crumb,</b> and thus, it may be used to establish important quality properties it should have. The MFS has shown to provide local and global image features that are both robust and low-dimensional, leading to feature vectors that capture essential information for classification tasks. Results show that the MFS-based classification is able to distinguish different <b>bread</b> <b>crumbs</b> with very high accuracy. Multifractal modelling of the underlying structure can be an appropriate method for parameterising and simulating the appearance of different <b>bread</b> <b>crumbs.</b>|$|R

50|$|Crunchy coconut shrimp is {{typically}} prepared using shrimp that are coated with flour, {{placed in an}} egg wash, coated with a flaked coconut and <b>bread</b> <b>crumb</b> mix, and then deep fried.

50|$|<b>Bread</b> <b>crumbs</b> or {{breadcrumbs}} (regional variants: breading, crispies) {{are small}} particles of dry bread, used for <b>breading</b> or <b>crumbing</b> foods, topping casseroles, stuffing poultry, thickening stews, adding inexpensive bulk to soups, meatloaves and similar foods, {{and making a}} crisp and crunchy covering for fried foods, especially breaded cutlets like tonkatsu and schnitzel.

They are coated with beaten eggs, and further coated with <b>bread</b> <b>crumbs,</b> and deep fried until golden brown. The <b>bread</b> <b>crumbs,</b> called panko, are {{specially}} dehydrated and have a coarser texture than other <b>bread</b> <b>crumbs.</b> Katsu are usually served with Japanese Worcestershire sauce or tonkatsu sauce (a variant of Worcestershire thickened with fruit and vegetable purees) and sliced cabbage.|$|R
30|$|The visual {{appearance}} {{of different types}} of <b>bread</b> <b>crumbs</b> can be successfully characterised by the multifractal dimensions of their digital images. The FDs obtained from the MFS method whose α∈[0, 0.23] provided a good measure of the <b>bread</b> <b>crumb</b> porosity, meaning that the higher these FDs, the higher the measure. In addition, the FDs whose α∈[0.79, 1] are useful to measure coarseness and heterogeneity of <b>bread</b> <b>crumb.</b> The MFS contains useful data to characterise the three measures, combining the information in one feature vector.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the effect of chitosan on the interaction of water with bread ingredients and assess the effect of the molecular weight of chitosan molecules on the interaction with protein and starch in bread and on the rate of staling. The changes of freezable bound water and total water contents in <b>bread</b> <b>crumb</b> were assessed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) from water melting and evaporation endotherms. It was found that freezable water content and total water conten in <b>bread</b> <b>crumb</b> decreases during staling more rapidly in the presence of chitosan. Two stages of <b>bread</b> <b>crumb</b> staling were indicated. Chitosan increases rate of bread staling during both stages. Chitosan oligosaccharides and low molecular weight chitosan increase <b>bread</b> <b>crumb</b> staling rate to a much less extent than do middle molecular weight chitosan. It was suggested that during bread staling chitosan increases water migration from crumb, prevents amylose-lipid complexation, and increases dehydration rate both for starch and gluten...|$|R
40|$|Texture {{analysis}} is an objective physical examination of baked products and gives direct {{information on the}} product quality, oppositely to dough rheology tests what inform on the baking suitability of the flour, as raw material. Evaluation of the mechanical properties of <b>bread</b> <b>crumb</b> is important not only for quality assurance in the bakeries, but also for assessing the effects of changes in dough ingredients and processing condition and also for describing the changes in <b>bread</b> <b>crumb</b> during storage. Crumb cellular structure is an important quality criterion used in commercial baking and research laboratories to judge bread quality alongside taste, crumb colour and crumb physical texture. In the framework of our research during the years 2010 – 2011 were analyzed selected indicators of <b>bread</b> <b>crumb</b> for texture quality of three Triticum spelta L. cultivars – Altgold, Rubiota and Ostro grown in an ecological system. The bread texture quality was evaluated on texture analyzer TA. XT Plus (Stable Micro Systems, Surrey, UK), following the AACC (74 - 09) standard and expressed as crumb firmness (N), stiffness (N. mm- 1) and relative elasticity (%). Our research proved that all selected indicators were significantly influenced by the year of growing and variety. The most soft bread was achieved in Rubiota, whereas <b>bread</b> <b>crumb</b> samples from Altgold and Ostro were the most firm and stiff. Correlation analysis showed strong negative correlation between relative elasticity and <b>bread</b> <b>crumb</b> firmness as well as bread stiffness (- 0. 65 ++, - 0. 66 ++).
