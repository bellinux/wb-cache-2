5|$|By custom {{there were}} seven {{conditions}} where a man could divorce his wife. These were: (1) disobedience to parents-in-law, (2) barrenness (unable to continue family line), (3) adultery (mixing another clan's blood into the family), (4) jealousy (of concubines), (5) incurable disease (unable to continue family line), (6) loquacity (not <b>getting</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> brothers-in-law or sisters-in-law), and (7) theft. However, a husband {{was not allowed to}} divorce his wife if she had completed three years of mourning for one of his deceased parents, if there were no living relatives in her father's family to return to, or if the husband's family was originally poor but became rich after marriage. Sometimes women were also able to initiate the divorce and remarry if the husband's family was in poverty, he was diseased, or his in-laws were too abusive. Although remarriage was frowned upon (especially since divorce meant a wife took away her dowry wealth from her ex-husband's family), it was nonetheless common amongst divorcees and widowers in all social groups.|$|E
5|$|The {{second and}} more {{important}} friendship was with Fanny (Frances) Blood, introduced to Wollstonecraft by the Clares, a couple in Hoxton who became parental figures to her; Wollstonecraft credited Blood with opening her mind. Unhappy with her home life, Wollstonecraft struck {{out on her own}} in 1778 and accepted a job as a lady's companion to Sarah Dawson, a widow living in Bath. However, Wollstonecraft had trouble <b>getting</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> the irascible woman (an experience she drew on when describing the drawbacks of such a position in Thoughts on the Education of Daughters, 1787). In 1780 she returned home, called back to care for her dying mother. Rather than return to Dawson's employ after the death of her mother, Wollstonecraft moved in with the Bloods. She realized during the two years she spent with the family that she had idealized Blood, who was more invested in traditional feminine values than was Wollstonecraft. But Wollstonecraft remained dedicated to her and her family throughout her life (she frequently gave pecuniary assistance to Blood's brother, for example).|$|E
5|$|Film {{director}} Barry Levinson {{sought to}} create a police drama television series based on , a 1991 non-fiction book by David Simon based on one year he spent with Baltimore Police Department homicide detectives. In addition to the book's being set in Levinson's home city of Baltimore, the director was attracted to the realistic way Simon portrayed police work and the detectives. The book contradicted many popular myths that had been built into past police dramas: it portrayed the detectives as not always <b>getting</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> each other and told stories of criminals who were not always caught or punished. It also portrayed detectives as solving cases primarily through physical evidence, witnesses and confessions, not by investigating motives like on many other police shows. Simon also sought to dispel the popular television perception that all detectives take their cases very personally and identify with their victims: in Simon's experience, homicide cases were primarily a job to the detectives, not personal. Levinson and Tom Fontana, who had past television experience as executive producer on the drama series St. Elsewhere, hired screenwriter Paul Attanasio to adapt elements of the book into the teleplay for the first episode. It was the first television script Attanasio ever wrote.|$|E

25|$|After training, Lair was {{forwarded}} to the Kingdom of Thailand {{for his first}} assignment, arriving on 1 March 1951. U.S. Ambassador to Thailand Edwin F. Stanton was {{in the throes of}} a postwar rapprochement between the two nations. Agreements between the two countries led to the beginning of the American buildup in Thailand. The aim was to help the Thais block any Communist Chinese incursions through the neighboring Kingdom of Laos. Lair's part in this was an assignment to train the Royal Thai Police. He used an old Imperial Japanese training camp in Hua Hin to train a select crew of Thai police in guerrilla warfare, including parachuting. In the process, Lair discovered he had a knack for <b>getting</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> the Thais. His bashfulness, his aversion to eye contact, and quiet courteous demeanor were so congruent with ideal Thai manners that his policemen bonded with him, even though he spoke broken Thai with a Texas twang. He trained with them, and underwent survival exercises with them. He even married a Thai socialite.|$|E
25|$|The storyline {{rivalry between}} Rey Escorpión and Último Guerrero {{that led to}} the main event match began back in the summer of 2011. While working under the ring name Escorpión he was teamed up with Último Guerrero for the 2011 Gran Alternativa tournament, a tag team tournament where a rookie (Escorpión) would team up with an {{experienced}} wrestler (Guerrero) for the tournament. The duo defeated the teams of Magnus and Brazo de Plata, Mortiz]and El Terrible, and Diamante and La Sombra to earn a spot in the final match. On April 8, 2011 Escorpión and Guerrero defeated Máscara Dorada and Metal Blanco to win the 2011 Gran Alternativa tournament. Shortly after the Gran Alternativa victory Escorpión changed his name to Rey Escorpión ("Scorpion King") and joined Último Guerrero's Los Guerreros del Infierno group that also included Dragón Rojo, Jr. at the time. In the summer of 2012 Rey Escorpión began having problems with other members of Los Guerreros, especially with the new Guerrero associates Euforia and Niebla Roja. The tension let to Escorpión being kicked out of the group, although the confrontations never turned to an actual fight, leading to Último Guerrero introducing both Euforia and Niebla Roja as full fledge members. On August 31, 2012, during CMLL's weekly Super Viernes show Rey Escorpión teamed with his former Los Guerreros team mates for a Trios tournament, actually winning the tournament despite not <b>getting</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> his team mates. Two weeks later the team were unsuccessful in their challenge for the CMLL World Trios Championship, which only furthered the issues between Rey Escorpión and Los Guerreros. The tension finally erupted into a physical encounter as Dragón Rojo, Jr. turned on Los Guerreros, siding with Rey Escorpión as they attacked Euforia after a match on the October 5th Super Viernes show. Afterward Escorpión and Dragón Rojo, Jr. announced that they were forming their own group, targeting Los Guerreros del Infierno. The team of Rey Escorpión, Dragón Rojo, Jr., and Pólvora was unveiled as Los Revolucionarios del Terror ("The Revolutionaries of Terror"). Following the formation of Los Revolucionarios the two factions faced off on several shows, but at the time the storyline never developed further.|$|E

500|$|During {{this same}} period, Southern Jews felt {{ambivalent}} about their status. Generally, {{they were able}} to economically thrive while <b>getting</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> their neighborsthe Atlanta Jewish elite was unusually assimilated into the political, economic, and social fabric of the city. Despite their success, they recognized themselves as different from the Gentile majority and were uncomfortable with their image. One of their strategies was to select rabbis and leaders who would put forth a positive image for their people and help reduce tensions between Jews and Gentiles. In Atlanta, a prominent leader from 1895 to 1946 was David Marx. To improve the image of Jews in their community, Marx's Reform temple adopted Americanized appearances. Despite his acceptance by the Gentile community, Marx believed that [...] "in isolated instances there is no prejudice entertained for the individual Jew, but there exists wide-spread and deep seated prejudice against Jews as an entire people." ...|$|E

500|$|At the time, Lupu Kostaki was {{organizing}} left-behind Conservatives {{and forming}} a provisional administration, answering to the German command. Filitti served Kostaki as Head of the National Theater Bucharest. Under his management, the Theater took on some 67 new productions of Romanian plays. The Germans also assigned {{him to an}} administrative position, making him the Prefect of Ialomița County. However, Filitti himself was troubled by his association with the puppet regime. According to Georgeta Filitti, the diary he kept shows [...] "the efforts to interpose himself between the foreign military authorities and his own administrators, to alleviate the unbearable regime of requisitions, the abuse and Prussian arrogance, [...] were, for the most part, ineffectual." [...] Like other Germanophiles, Filitti justified himself as a protector of Romanian interests during times of chaos, and was discouraged {{to find out that}} the German regime regarded him as a servant. He had similar trouble <b>getting</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> some of his Romanian colleagues, in particular Virgil Arion, the phantom Minister of Education (whom he described as nepotistic, aloof, and especially [...] "lazy").|$|E

[...] He also added that this process of [...] "doing Audioslave business" [...] led him to go solo. Cornell has said that the breakup was not about money, but that he was just not <b>getting</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> the other members during their later years. Said Cornell, [...] "Getting along as people is one thing. Getting along as a group of people that can work together in a band situation...We weren't particularly getting along well, no.

During this time, Barrett also played guitar on the {{sessions}} for Soft Machine founder Kevin Ayers' debut LP, Joy of a Toy, although his performance on [...] "Religious Experience" [...] was not released until the album was reissued in 2003.

500|$|Rimsky-Korsakov {{recalled}} that [...] "Balakirev had no difficulty in <b>getting</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> me. At his suggestion I most readily rewrote the symphonic movements composed {{by me and}} brought them to completion {{with the help of}} his advice and improvisations". Though Rimsky-Korsakov later found Balakirev's influence stifling, and broke free from it, this did not stop him in his memoirs from extolling the older composer's talents as a critic and improviser. Under Balakirev's mentoring, Rimsky-Korsakov turned to other compositions. He began a symphony in B minor, but felt it too closely followed Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and abandoned it. He completed an Overture on Three Russian Themes, based on Balakirev's folksong overtures, as well as a Fantasia on Serbian Themes that was performed at a concert given for the delegates of the Slavonic Congress in 1867. In his review of this concert, nationalist critic Vladimir Stasov coined the phrase Moguchaya kuchka for the Balakirev circle (Moguchaya kuchka is usually translated as [...] "The Mighty Handful" [...] or [...] "The Five"). Rimsky-Korsakov also composed the initial versions of Sadko and Antar, which cemented his reputation as a writer of orchestral works.|$|E

500|$|Therefrom emerged a film {{treatment}} called The Message.

Eventually Feldman came to believe this concept had some credibility issues, and instead changed the protagonists to a government team. After coining the name [...] "Sil," [...] Feldman initially thought of forming an acronym, but in the end chose only the three-letter name after learning about the codons of the genetic code, which can be represented in groups of three letters. Sil would originally emerge from a DNA sequence manipulating human DNA, and constantly mutate as she used the human junk DNA to access [...] "all the defenses of the entire animal kingdom that [...] evolved through – including ones that had never developed, plus ones [...] don't know about that have become extinct." [...] Among the research Feldman did for the script included going to sessions of UCLA's Center for the Study of Evolution and the Origin of Life (CSEOL), talking to SETI scientists, and visiting the Salk Institute for Biological Studies to talk with researchers working on the Human Genome Project. The Message was offered to several studios, but was passed up.|$|E
500|$|In June of the 1907 season, Lajoie's [...]296 average, [...] "an average {{even now}} that scores of players {{would be glad}} to accept," [...] put him at risk for hitting below [...]300 {{for the first time in}} his career. He also missed 15 games due to a {{recurrence}} of sepsis which he contracted during the 1905 season. Lajoie and Naps first baseman George Stovall got into an argument in a hotel lobby and Stovall broke a chair over Lajoie's head. [...] "George didn't mean anything by it", Lajoie said, and the two maintained a working relationship. He finished the season with an average of [...]299. Naps owner Charles Somers received a trade offer from the Detroit Tigers for the Naps' Elmer Flick and Tigers' Ty Cobb. Tigers manager Hughie Jennings called Somers and told him he was offering the trade because Cobb was not <b>getting</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> several teammates. Somers decided to retain Flick, saying, [...] "We'll keep Flick. Maybe he isn't as good a batter as Cobb, but he's much nicer to have on the team." [...] The Naps finished the regular season in second place to the Tigers with a 9064 record, a half-game behind the Tigers (who finished 9063 and were not forced to make-up a rained out game in accordance with league rules). Lajoie was partly blamed for the Naps' second-place finish. Author Fred McMane described an instance during the season between Naps catcher Nig Clarke and Lajoie.|$|E
