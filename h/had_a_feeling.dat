Colin arrives at Dot's house, saying he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> she would {{not go to the}} wedding. Colin visits The Queen Victoria pub and witnesses the funeral of Paul Coker (Jonny Labey), who was killed for being gay, and laments to another gay man, Johnny Carter (Ted Reilly), of the homophobia in the world, but is comforted by the majority of gay acceptance.

The actress explained that they had to film five weeks worth of episodes in one week, before McGregor flew back to Los Angeles. McGregor told a reporter for The Newcastle Herald that he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> {{he was going to be}} asked back eventually, but it still came as a surprise to him.

500|$|Following Chelsea's victory, player-manager Vialli was {{satisfied}} with his club's performance, commending the substitution of Zola by assistant manager Graham Rix: [...] "He decided he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> and he was right". Vialli also praised Zola, but felt that the honours had to be shared by all the players including Vialli himself, {{who took part in}} the match: [...] "It was a great first touch – he put the ball in the net and we won the cup. But the credit has to be shared between all the chaps – and I am over the moon." [...] The Italian further added that their goal now was to win the league championship: [...] "The next step will be the Premier League, fingers crossed. I am still the player-manager and I have to be one next season. We are very happy to win, but we do not want to stop here.

500|$|I {{can only}} {{remember}} {{bits and pieces}} of the game. I was psyched. I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> of euphoria. I was zeroed in on the [...] glove, but I didn't hit the glove too much. I remember hitting a couple of batters, and the bases were loaded two or three times. The ball was small sometimes, the ball was large sometimes, sometimes I saw the catcher, sometimes I didn't. Sometimes, I tried to stare the hitter down and throw while I was looking at him. I chewed my gum until it turned to powder. I started having a crazy idea in the fourth inning that Richard Nixon was the home plate umpire, and once I thought I was pitching a baseball to Jimi Hendrix, who to me was holding a guitar and swinging it over the plate. They say I had about three to four fielding chances. I remember diving {{out of the way of}} a ball I thought was a line drive. I jumped, but the ball wasn't hit hard and never reached me.|$|E
500|$|The band's One Hot Minute tour {{proved to}} be {{successful}} however for the band it could easily {{be viewed as a}} disaster. Navarro never felt he fit properly in the band and the chemistry just wasn't there with him. Following attempts to write and rehearse for their seventh studio album, in April 1998, it was announced that Navarro had been fired from the band due to creative differences; Kiedis stated that the decision was [...] "mutual". With the band {{on the brink of a}} break-up, Kiedis informed Flea that he felt the only way the band could continue is if Frusicante would return. Flea surprised Kiedis by stating he had been in contact with Frusciante and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> he might be open to rejoining. That same month after Navarro's departure, Flea visited Frusciante and invited him to rejoin the band. An emotional and now sober Frusciante readily accepted the invitation. With Frusciante back, the band went on to release three of their most successful albums; 1999's Californication, 2002's By the Way and 2006's Stadium Arcadium.|$|E

O'Donnell also introduced a distinctive piano theme which had never been heard before, and first made its appearance in the Halo 3 announcement teaser. In an interview, O'Donnell stated that he has always approached music from the keyboard, and that at the Electronic Entertainment Expo—where the trailer would first be shown—he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> that, [...] "no [...] would start with a piano." [...] O'Donnell planned on composing the music [...] "at the last minute", saying {{he had no intention of}} producing a large amount of music that would never be used. [...] "It drives everyone crazy but it worked for me in the past and it works for the game in the best way. Writing music before the end just doesn't work for me," [...] he said.|$|E

500|$|The Andy Griffith Show [...] is an American {{situation}} comedy which aired on CBS from October 3, 1960, to September 6, 1971, {{with a total}} of 249 half-hour episodes spanning over 8 seasons, first in black and white and then in color, which partially originated from an episode of The Danny Thomas Show. It originally starred Andy Griffith in the role of Andy Taylor, the widowed sheriff of the fictional small community of Mayberry, North Carolina. Other major characters include Andy's inept but well-meaning deputy, who is also his cousin, Barney Fife (Don Knotts); Andy's spinster aunt and housekeeper, [...] "Aunt" [...] Bee Taylor (Frances Bavier), and Andy's precocious young son, Opie (Ron Howard). Eccentric townspeople and temperamental girlfriends complete the cast. Regarding the tone of the show, Griffith said that despite a contemporary setting, the show evoked nostalgia, stating in a Today Show interview: [...] "Well, though we never said it, and though it was shot in the '60s, it <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> of the '30s. It was, when we were doing it, of a time gone by." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the match, Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier {{claimed he}} had a premonition that goalkeeper Dudek would be {{the hero of the}} final: [...] "I told Jerzy three days ago 'I can feel you will be the hero.

I just <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling.</b> I'm a great believer that when you have the right attitude everything else follows. He had a good run after the World Cup but then he made some mistakes and we had to support him. The squad get on very well. There was no finger-pointing after that game. He has saved us before in games and we had to keep faith in him." [...] Houllier also praised Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson: [...] "I wished him the best in the Champions League because he represents the best in English football, he congratulated every Liverpool player after the final whistle and that shows that he is not just a great manager but a great man." ...|$|E
500|$|Zambia {{qualified}} one boxer for the Olympic boxing tournament. Gilbert Choombe {{qualified for}} the light welterweight class at the AIBA African Olympic Qualifying Event Casablanca. He had not participated in any previous Olympic Games and was the youngest male athlete on the Zambia Olympic team, at age 20. Choombe trained in Cardiff where it was affected by rain and cold weather and later adapted to hot weather conditions in London. He stated that his objective was to claim the gold medal and make Zambia proud. Choombe began the contest in the round of 32 against Australia's Jeff Horn at ExCeL London on 31 July. Horn began strongly by performing quick shots at Choombe who attempted to react by throwing back some punches but missed most of them. Horn clinched the first round 6–1, and took the second round by 4–2 when Choombe made his guard vulnerable to attack. Horn attacked consistently and by selecting his angles, he defeated Choombe 19–5. After the fight Choombe described it as [...] "tough" [...] and that he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> of securing the victory but knew his opponment was stronger.|$|E

500|$|The game's plot, as {{described}} by Dave Grossman: [...] "It's a story about this young man who comes to an island {{in search of his}} life's dream. He's pursuing his career goals and he discovers love in the process and winds up thinking that was actually more important than what he was doing to begin with. You’re laughing, but there's actually something deeper going on as well." [...] When work on the plot began, Gilbert discovered that Schafer's and Grossman's writing styles were too different to form a cohesive whole: Grossman's was [...] "very kind of a dry, sarcastic humor" [...] and Schafer's was [...] "just a little more in your face". In reaction, Gilbert assigned them to different characters and story moments depending on what type of comedy was required. Grossman believed that this benefited the game's writing, as he and Schafer [...] "were all funny in slightly different ways, and it worked well together". Schafer and Grossman wrote most of the dialogue while they were programming the game; as a result, much of it was improvised. Some of the dialogue was based on the designers' personal experiences, such as Guybrush's line [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> in hell there would be mushrooms", which came from Schafer's own hatred of fungi.|$|E
500|$|Julian Jarrold became {{attached}} {{to direct the}} film in early 2005. It was his second feature film, after Kinky Boots, which was released later that year. According to Bernstein, he [...] "liked [...] style as it was modern and visceral, and I just <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> {{that he was the}} right choice. This piece needed to be handed with delicacy but also {{with a certain amount of}} brio and Julian was able to bring those two things to the production." [...] The director began work on the project in early 2006, rereading the novels Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, and Persuasion and also reviewing Austen biographies such as Spence's book. Jarrold depended most heavily on the script, calling it [...] "a rich, witty and clever screenplay from someone who obviously knew his subject very well. It is a love story but much more besides. Kevin's screenplay has so many layers and interesting ideas. Apart from the love story I was very attracted by the themes of imagination and experience." [...] The director intended to [...] "bring Austen up to date by roughening her up a bit" [...] and adding [...] "more life and energy and fun," [...] opining that past Austen adaptations had been [...] "a little bit picture-postcard and safe and sweet and nice." ...|$|E
