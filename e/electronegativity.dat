5|$|<b>Electronegativity</b> is the {{tendency}} of an atom to attract electrons. An atom's <b>electronegativity</b> is affected by both its atomic number and {{the distance between the}} valence electrons and the nucleus. The higher its <b>electronegativity,</b> the more an element attracts electrons. It was first proposed by Linus Pauling in 1932. In general, <b>electronegativity</b> increases on passing from left to right along a period, and decreases on descending a group. Hence, fluorine is the most electronegative of the elements, while caesium is the least, at least of those elements for which substantial data is available.|$|E
5|$|The {{familiar}} Pauling <b>electronegativity</b> scale relies upon {{chemical bond}} energies, but such values have obviously not been measured for inert helium and neon. The Allen <b>electronegativity</b> scale, which relies only upon (measurable) atomic energies, identifies neon {{as the most}} electronegative element, closely followed by fluorine and helium.|$|E
5|$|The {{melting point}} of {{zirconium}} is 1855°C (3371°F), and {{the boiling point}} is 4371°C (7900°F). Zirconium has an <b>electronegativity</b> of 1.33 on the Pauling scale. Of the elements within the d-block with known electronegativities, zirconium has the fifth lowest <b>electronegativity</b> after hafnium, yttrium, lanthanum, and actinium.|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} is {{presented}} for calculation of <b>electronegativities</b> of groups, or substituents, or substructures of molecules. The method combines the electron energies of the valence orbitals of each atom in the fragment. It {{is a simple}} calculation, well-suited to computers, which can provide the <b>electronegativities</b> of elements, atoms, substituents, substructures, and ionic groups. It is especially suited to calculation of the <b>electronegativities</b> of heterocyclic fragments...|$|R
5|$|Elements in {{the same}} group tend to show {{patterns}} in atomic radius, ionization energy, and <b>electronegativity.</b> From top to bottom in a group, the atomic radii of the elements increase. Since there are more filled energy levels, valence electrons are found farther from the nucleus. From the top, each successive element has a lower ionization energy because {{it is easier to}} remove an electron since the atoms are less tightly bound. Similarly, a group has a top-to-bottom decrease in <b>electronegativity</b> due to an increasing distance between valence electrons and the nucleus. There are exceptions to these trends, however: for example, in group 11, <b>electronegativity</b> increases farther down the group.|$|E
5|$|Astatine has an <b>electronegativity</b> of 2.2 on {{the revised}} Pauling scale– {{lower than that}} of iodine (2.66) and the same as {{hydrogen}}. In hydrogen astatide (HAt) the negative charge is predicted to be on the hydrogen atom, implying that this compound should instead be referred to as astatine hydride. That would be consistent with the <b>electronegativity</b> of astatine on the Allred–Rochow scale (1.9) being less than that of hydrogen (2.2). The electron affinity of astatine is predicted to be reduced by one-third because of spin–orbit interactions.|$|E
5|$|There {{are some}} {{exceptions}} to this general rule. Gallium and germanium have higher electronegativities than aluminium and silicon respectively because of the d-block contraction. Elements of the fourth period immediately after the first row of the transition metals have unusually small atomic radii because the 3d-electrons are not effective at shielding the increased nuclear charge, and smaller atomic size correlates with higher <b>electronegativity.</b> The anomalously high <b>electronegativity</b> of lead, particularly when compared to thallium and bismuth, {{appears to be an}} artifact of data selection (and data availability)—methods of calculation other than the Pauling method show the normal periodic trends for these elements.|$|E

25|$|Molecules with odd-electron {{bonds are}} usually highly reactive. These types of bond are only stable between atoms with similar <b>electronegativities.</b>|$|R
5|$|Because of {{the higher}} <b>electronegativity</b> of lithium, some of its {{compounds}} have a more covalent character. For example, lithium iodide (LiI) will dissolve in organic solvents, a property of most covalent compounds. Lithium fluoride (LiF) is the only alkali halide that is not soluble in water, and lithium hydroxide (LiOH) is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent.|$|E
5|$|Caesium {{fluoride}} or cesium fluoride is an {{inorganic compound}} usually encountered as a hygroscopic white solid. It {{is used in}} organic synthesis {{as a source of}} the fluoride anion. Caesium has the highest electropositivity of all non-radioactive elements and fluorine has the highest <b>electronegativity</b> of all elements.|$|E
5|$|Elements in {{the same}} period show trends in atomic radius, {{ionization}} energy, electron affinity, and <b>electronegativity.</b> Moving left to right across a period, atomic radius usually decreases. This occurs because each successive element has an added proton and electron, which causes the electron to be drawn closer to the nucleus. This decrease in atomic radius also causes the ionization energy to increase when moving from left to right across a period. The more tightly bound an element is, the more energy is required to remove an electron. <b>Electronegativity</b> increases {{in the same}} manner as ionization energy because of the pull exerted on the electrons by the nucleus. Electron affinity also shows a slight trend across a period. Metals (left side of a period) generally have a lower electron affinity than nonmetals (right side of a period), with the exception of the noble gases.|$|E
40|$|Vibronic {{coupling}} for inter–valence charge–transfer {{states in}} linear symmetric ABA molecules (A, B = s–, p – or d–block element) is investigated computationally. In particu-lar we examine vibronic coupling {{as a function}} of the s, p, d – block nature of the A and B constituent elements. Based on density-functional theory computations for 395 triatomic molecules, we construct a map of a vibronic stability parameter G (defined as the ratio of asymmetric to symmetric stretching force constants) across the periodic table. Correla-tions of G versus the sum and difference of <b>electronegativities</b> of A and B elements are tested, and also vs. a useful parameter f, the ratio of the sum of <b>electronegativities</b> to an AB separation. Usually, the larger the sum of <b>electronegativities,</b> and the shorter the AB bond, the larger the vibronic instability. The largest vibronic instability thus occurs for interhalogen compounds. Molecules containing d-block elements exhibit trends similar to those of molecules built of p-block elements with similar <b>electronegativities,</b> although the latter are usually more unstable. A molecular orbital model is developed to explain the trends obtained in our computa-tions, as well as to build a framework for systematic manipulation of vibronic couplin...|$|R
25|$|In 1941, Schomaker and Stevenson {{proposed}} an empirical equation {{to determine the}} bond length of an atom based on the differences in <b>electronegativities</b> of the two bonded atoms.|$|R
40|$|Our {{previously}} introduced QTPIE (charge transfer with polarization current equilibration) model (J. Chen and T. J. Martinez, Chem. Phys. Lett. 438, 315 (2007)) is a fluctuating-charge {{model with}} correct asymptotic behavior. Unlike most other fluctuating-charge models, QTPIE is formulated {{in terms of}} charge-transfer variables and pairwise <b>electronegativities,</b> not atomic charge variables and <b>electronegativities.</b> The pairwise character of the <b>electronegativities</b> in QTPIE avoids spurious charge transfer when bonds are broken. However, the increased number of variables leads to considerable computational expense and a rank-deficient set of working equations, which is numerically inconvenient. Here, we show that QTPIE can be exactly reformulated in terms of atomic charge variables, leading to a considerable reduction in computational complexity. The transformation between atomic and bond variables is generally applicable to arbitrary fluctuating charge models, and uncovers an underlying topological framework {{that can be used}} to understand the relation between fluctuating-charge models and the classical theory of electrical circuits.

5|$|Hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, chlorine, {{plus the}} noble gases are collectively {{referred}} to as the elemental gases. These elements are gaseous at standard temperature and pressure (STP). They are also distinguished by having the lowest densities, lowest melting and boiling points, strongest insulating properties, and highest <b>electronegativity</b> and ionization energy values in the periodic table.|$|E
5|$|Lead shows {{two main}} {{oxidation}} states: +4 and +2. The tetravalent state {{is common for}} the carbon group. The divalent state is rare for carbon and silicon, minor for germanium, important (but not prevailing) for tin, and is the more important for lead. This is attributable to relativistic effects, specifically the inert pair effect, which manifests itself {{when there is a}} large difference in <b>electronegativity</b> between lead and oxide, halide, or nitride anions, leading to a significant partial positive charge on lead. The result is a stronger contraction of the lead 6s orbital than is the case for the 6p orbital, making it rather inert in ionic compounds. This is less applicable to compounds in which lead forms covalent bonds with elements of similar <b>electronegativity</b> such as carbon in organolead compounds. In these, the 6s and 6p orbitals remain similarly sized and sp3 hybridization is still energetically favorable. Lead, like carbon, is predominantly tetravalent in such compounds.|$|E
5|$|The above table {{reflects}} the hybrid nature of metalloids. The properties of form, appearance, and behaviour when mixed with metals {{are more like}} metals. Elasticity and general chemical behaviour are more like nonmetals. Electrical conductivity, band structure, ionization energy, <b>electronegativity,</b> and oxides are intermediate between the two.|$|E
5000|$|Analysis of {{a number}} of {{compounds}} where charge shift resonance energy is significant shows that in many cases elements with high <b>electronegativities</b> are involved and these have smaller orbitals and are lone pair rich. Factors that reduce the covalent contribution to the bond energy include poor overlap of bonding orbitals, and the lone pair bond weakening effect where repulsion due to the Pauli exclusion principle is the main factor. [...] There is no correlation between the REcs and the difference between the <b>electronegativities</b> of the bonded atoms as might be expected from the Pauling bonding model, however there is a global correlation between REcs and the sum of their <b>electronegativities</b> which can be accounted for in part by the lone pair bond weakening effect. The charge-shift nature of the inverted bond in 1.1.1propellanes has been ascribed to the Pauli repulsion due to the adjacent [...] "wing" [...] bonds destabilising of the covalent contribution.|$|R

50|$|Class I {{charges are}} those that are not {{determined}} from quantum mechanics, but from some intuitive or arbitrary approach. These approaches can be based on experimental data such as dipoles and <b>electronegativities.</b>|$|R
5|$|There is a {{relatively}} large difference in the <b>electronegativity</b> of lead(II) at 1.87 and lead(IV) at 2.33. This difference marks the reversal in the trend of increasing stability of the +4 oxidation state going down carbon group; tin, by comparison, has values of 1.80 in the +2 oxidation state and 1.96 in the +4 state.|$|E
5|$|Carbon is brittle, and behaves as a {{semiconductor}} in {{a direction}} perpendicular to its planes. Most of its chemistry is nonmetallic; it has a relatively high ionization energy and, compared to most metals, a relatively high <b>electronegativity.</b> Carbon can form anions such as C4− (methanide), C (acetylide) and C (sesquicarbide or allylenide), in compounds with metals of main groups 1–3, and with the lanthanides and actinides. Its oxide CO2 forms carbonic acid H2CO3.|$|E
5|$|Chemically, scandium, yttrium and {{lutetium}} (and presumably lawrencium) {{behave like}} trivalent {{versions of the}} group 1–2 metals. On the other hand, trends going down the group for properties such as melting point, <b>electronegativity</b> and ionic radius, {{are similar to those}} found among their group 4–8 counterparts. In this variant, the number of f electrons in the gaseous forms of the f-block atoms usually matches their position in the f-block. For example, the f-electron counts for the first five f-block elements are La 0, Ce 1, Pr 3, Nd 4 and Pm 5.|$|E

5|$|Chlorine is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Cl and atomic number 17. The second-lightest of the halogens, it appears between fluorine and bromine in {{the periodic table}} and its properties are mostly intermediate between them. Chlorine is a yellow-green gas at room temperature. It is an extremely reactive element and a strong oxidising agent: among the elements, it has the highest electron affinity and the third-highest <b>electronegativity,</b> behind only oxygen and fluorine.|$|E
5|$|Due to its <b>electronegativity,</b> oxygen forms {{chemical}} {{bonds with}} almost all other elements to give corresponding oxides. The surface of most metals, such as aluminium and titanium, are oxidized {{in the presence}} of air and become coated with a thin film of oxide that passivates the metal and slows further corrosion. Many oxides of the transition metals are non-stoichiometric compounds, with slightly less metal than the chemical formula would show. For example, the mineral FeO (wüstite) is written as , where x is usually around 0.05.|$|E
5|$|Fluorine's first {{ionization}} energy is third-highest among all elements, behind helium and neon, which complicates {{the removal of}} electrons from neutral fluorine atoms. It also has a high electron affinity, second only to chlorine, and tends to capture an electron to become isoelectronic with the noble gas neon; it has the highest <b>electronegativity</b> of any element.
