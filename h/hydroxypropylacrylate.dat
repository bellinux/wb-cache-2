40|$|Four {{different}} oligoethylene glycol acrylates (OEGA), namely <b>hydroxypropylacrylate</b> (HPA), methoxy {{diethylene glycol}} acrylate (mDEGA), methoxy triethylene glycol acrylate (mTEGA) and 2 -hydroxyethylacrylate (HEA) were homopolymerized via RAFT polymerization employing a naphthalene functionalized chain transfer agent resulting in thermoresponsive naphthalene-functionalized POEGAs with different hydrophilicities. Supramolecular inclusion complexes of these POEGAs with electron-deficient cyclophane cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) tetrachloride (CBPQT 4 +) in water were studied. The association constants (Ka) {{were determined to}} study the effect that polymer hydrophilicity has on the Ka and {{results indicated that the}} nature of the polymer did not significantly influence the complexation strength and the association is mostly enthalpy driven. The impact of temperature on the hostâ€“guest complexes was also investigated. A continuous partial thermally induced dissociation of complexes was observed upon raising the temperature with a more distinct decrease in complexation around the cloud point temperature (TCP) of the POEGA employed, indicating the importance of the polymer phase transition for tuning the recognition properties of dialkoxynaphthalene end-decorated poly(oligoethylene glycol acrylate) s in water...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of controlled radical polymn. techniques, namely atom transfer radical polymn. (ATRP), reversible addn. fragmentation transfer (RAFT) and nitroxide mediated radical polymn. (NMP), {{have opened up}} unprecedented possibilities for the synthesis of well-defined macromol. architectures with a large no. of different monomers. In addn., well-defined polymers with LCST behavior have wound widespread interest for a use as -smart' responsive materials. Here we report our automated parallel investigations on the NMP of 2 <b>hydroxypropylacrylate</b> (HPA), N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMA) and N-acryloyl morpholine (Amor) using BlocBuilder- nitroxide and addnl. free SG- 1 nitroxide. The high-throughput approach allowed fast optimization of the polymn. procedure for solvent, temp. and concn. of free nitroxide. In addn., the optimal polymn. conditions were applied for the synthesis of systematical libraries of well-defined statistical copolymers based on HPA and DMA or Amor. The effect of monomer compn. on the thermal properties and thermoresponsiveness of the copolymers was studied in detail. [on SciFinder (R) ...|$|E
