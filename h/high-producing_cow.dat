40|$|The {{principles}} for milking the <b>high-producing</b> <b>cow</b> {{are the same}} as for any other dairy cow: her teats should be clean and dry for milking; she should be milked gently, quickly and completely with minimal machine stripping or overmilking. However, these principles need to be applied in different ways because high-producing cows have: 1) a lower pre-milking stimulus requirement compared with low-producing cows, 2) higher peak milking rates and higher average flowrates (in spite of this, high producers take longer to milk), 3) poorer teat-end condition, 4) higher risk of new mastitis infections. Although less time and effort is needed for deliberate manual stimulation in high-producing herds, there is a progressively greater need for meticulous care and attention to ensure teats are clean and dry before milking to minimize the increased risk of mastitis. Healthy teat skin provides the best defence against all types of mastitis pathogens. Teat condition can be improved, and milking times per cow reduced by use of excellent milking procedures and adjusting the take-off settings of automatic detachers. The new performance-based ISO international standards for milking installations can be used, with confidence, to evaluate the “system ” components of existing milking systems. The results of milking-time tests (measurements or observations made while milking cows) are the best and most direct indicator of the performance of milking units...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNutrient {{composition}} of the feed and formulated ration often differ depending on uncertainties in DM content and nutrient {{composition of}} ingredients, {{as well as from}} feeder errors during loading. The objective {{of this study was to}} describe the deviation from target weight for the <b>high-producing</b> <b>cow</b> ration (HCR) and premix (HCP) on 26 California dairies ranging in size from 1, 100 to 6, 900 cows. Records from a consecutive 12 -mo period were extracted from FeedWatch 7 (Valley Agricultural Software Inc., Tulare, CA), a feeding management software. Variables extracted and studied were date, recipe type, recipe number, ingredient, loading sequence, target weight, weight, and tolerance level (TL, deviation allowed per ingredient during loading). Based on the distribution of the deviation from target weight for the 8 most common ingredients, loading accuracy (quartile 1; small: | 20 | kg), loading precision (interquartile range=quartile 3 to 1; small: 40 kg), and extreme observations (quartile 3; small: | 40 | kg) were described. Descriptive statistics were conducted with SAS 9. 4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The median TL assigned to ingredients across dairies ranged from 0 to 90 kg. At the ingredient level, the TL allowed a deviation from the median ingredient target weight of 0 to 2 (53. 9 %), > 2 to 5 (25. 5 %), > 5 to 10 (11. 6 %), or > 10 % (8. 9 %). A total of 2. 5 % of the loads did not reach the target weight set by the TL, ranging from 0. 1 to 21. 1 % loads across dairies. Ingredient deviation from the formulated target weight across dairies was below target 49. 1 % of the time [0 to 2 (36. 7 %), > 2 to 5 (8. 9 %), > 5 to 10 (1. 2 %), > 10 % (0. 2 %) ]. Five dairies loaded ingredients with adequate accuracy (small to medium, quartile 1) and adequate precision (small to medium, interquartile range), but accuracy and precision were very poor on 3 dairies (large, quartile 1 and interquartile range). Rolled corn and almond hulls were loaded with adequate precision (small to medium, interquartile range) on a minimum of 64 % of the dairies and adequate accuracy (small, quartile 1) on at least 68 % of the dairies. In contrast, alfalfa hay, corn silage, and canola were loaded with poor precision (large, interquartile range) on a minimum of 60 % of the dairies. There was a large variation within and across dairies on the deviation from target weight. Readjusting the TL settings might reduce the deviation from target weight. On 5 dairies, feeders were able to load ingredients with minimal deviation from target weight, setting achievable goals for the industry. Based on loading errors, opportunities exist to improve feeder performance on California dairies...|$|E

This NebGuide discusses {{important aspects of}} grouping and feeding systems, body conditioning, and nutritional requirements for <b>high-producing</b> dairy <b>cows.</b> As herd production levels continue to increase along with the average herd size, it is becoming more difficult for many dairy producers to feed their cattle adequate nutrients to maintain high production. Within a given herd a producer usually has cows at varying production levels and lactation stages, all of which require different ration formulations and energy levels if the cattle are going to produce at optimum levels. Also, proper nutrition is required early in the lactation to prepare the cow 2 ̆ 7 s reproductive system for conception and pregnancy. Proper nutrition is also important if cattle are to ward off infections, such as mastitis and metabolic problems. A properly nourished cow will be in better physical condition to handle stress and other physical challenges. Therefore, the feeding system must undergo significant modification as production levels increase, {{not only for the}} producer to maintain profitable production, but also for the physical well-being of dairy cattle...|$|R

Twenty <b>high-producing</b> Holstein <b>cows</b> were synchronized to ovulation (Day 0) with the Ovsynch protocol and received hCG (1500  IU im) on Day 12. Corpora lutea formation (as evaluated by ultrasonography) and plasma P 4 concentrations were monitored from Days 4 to 36. hCG treatment induced the formation of one secondary CL (CL 2) in 11 of 20 cows (55 %) from the dominant follicle (mean diameter: 14. 2  ±  0. 9  mm) of two-wave (3 / 11) and three-wave (8 / 11) cycles. The maximal diameter of the CL 2 (23. 3  ±  1. 9  mm) was reached approximately 6  days after hCG treatment and was correlated with its structural lifespan (p <  0. 01). Cows that formed a CL 2 after hCG had higher mean plasma P 4 concentrations on Day 14 (+ 4. 5  ng/ml) and Day 18 (+ 3. 0  ng/ml) compared with cows without CL 2 (p <  0. 05). The structural regression of CL 2 begun approximately 8  days after that of the CL 1, and the median time at which the first drop in circulating P 4 levels occurred was later in cows that formed a CL 2 than in those that did not (Day 26 vs Day 18; p <  0. 01).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate the value of pregnancy for dairy cows. Effects of the stage of gesta-tion, stage of lactation, lactation number, milk yield, milk price, replacement heifer cost, probability of preg-nancy, probability of involuntary culling, and breeding decisions were studied. A bioeconomic model was used, and breeding and replacement decisions were opti-mized. A general Holstein herd in the United States was modeled. The average value of a new pregnancy was $ 278. The value of a new pregnancy increased with days in milk early in lactation but typically decreased later in lactation. Relatively <b>high-producing</b> <b>cows</b> and first-lactation cows reached greater values, and their values peaked later in lactation. The average cost of a pregnancy loss (abortion) was $ 555. The cost of a pregnancy loss typically increased with gestation length. Sensitivity analyses showed that an increased probability of pregnancy, an increased persistency of milk yield, and a smaller replacement heifer cost greatly reduced the average value of a pregnancy. The value of a new pregnancy was negative for relatively <b>high-producing</b> first-lactation <b>cows</b> when persistency of lactation and the probability of pregnancy were in-creased. Breeding was delayed when the value of preg-nancy was negative. Changes in milk price, absolute milk yield, and probability of involuntary culling had less effect on the value of pregnancy.

40|$|Objectives were to {{evaluate}} progesterone concentrations after cows had initiated estrous cycles following calving and induction of estrous cycles in postpartum anovular <b>high-producing</b> Holstein dairy <b>cows</b> treated with controlled internal drug releasing (CIDR). In experiment 1 (EXP 1), 62 cows that had initiated estrous cycles received a new CIDR (NCIDR) containing 1. 38 g of progesterone or a 7 -d used autoclaved CIDR (UCIDR) 48 h after luteolysis for 7 d. Ovaries were examined by ultrasonography, and plasma analyzed for concentrations of progesterone. In experiment 2 (EXP 2), 515 cows diagnosed as anestrus {{were randomly assigned}} to untreated control, NCIDR or UCIDR for 6 d. Plasma was analyzed for concentration of progesterone 12 d after CIDR removal to determine ovulation. In EXP 1, milk yield and body condition did not influence progesterone concentrations. Concentration of progesterone tended to increase faster (P = 0. 10) in cows receiving UCIDR than NCIDR, but both treatments reached a plateau at 90 min. Cows receiving the NCIDR had greater (P = 0. 04) concentrations of progesterone during the 7 -d treatment, but they were mostly subluteal (3 ̆c 1. 0 ng/mL) after d 2. After removal, concentrations of progesterone were greater for NCIDR than UCIDR for the first 45 min, and were similar thereafter. Multiparous cows had lesser (P = 0. 004) concentrations than primiparous cows throughout the study. The pattern of ovarian follicular development was not affected by treatment. In EXP 2, induction of onset of estrous cycles increased (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) with progesterone treatments, but was similar between NCIDR and UCIDR. Proportion of cows experiencing shorter than typical length estrous cycles after first AI tended to be greater (P = 0. 09) for control cows than those receiving the CIDR, and for cows remaining anestrous than those in which onset of estrous cycles was induced. Pregnancy per AI and pregnancy loss were similar among treatments. Cows that resumed estrous cyclicity prior to first AI had greater (P = 0. 01) pregnancy per AI. Treatment of <b>high-producing</b> Holstein <b>cows</b> that had previously initiated onset of estrous cycles with CIDR resulted in subluteal concentrations of progesterone, but in anestrous <b>high-producing</b> <b>cows</b> increased induction of estrous cycles with no effect on fertility at first insemination...|$|R
40|$|The {{decrease}} in fertility and conception rates of <b>high-producing</b> dairy <b>cows</b> {{is one of}} the major negative impacts for today's producers. The recovery of ovarian activity postpartum is affected by the status of immunity, metabolism and reproduction and plays a critical role in subsequent fertility after parturition in the cow. In the present study we investigated the relationships between polymorphisms in genes relating to the above functions and the first postpartum ovulation as a marker of the recovery of ovarian function in the cow. In immune function related-factors, the occurrence of first postpartum ovulation within 3 weeks in the C/C genotypes of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) exon (55. 4 %) and the A/G genotypes of TNFα promoter (55. 4 %) was significantly higher than that in T/T genotypes of TNFα exon (14. 3 %) and A/A genotypes of TNFα promoter (14. 3 %). Moreover, anovulatory cows with the T/T genotype of TNFα exon and the A/A genotype of TNFα promoter tended to have a prolonged days open compared with those of the other genotypes of TNFα polymorphisms. In metabolic function-related factors, ovulatory and anovulatory cows had a different distribution for alleles of the growth hormone receptor, but there were no significant differences in genotype and allele frequency of insulin-like growth factor-I polymorphism. No significant relationships were found between ovarian function after parturition and polymorphisms for reproduction-related genes. In conclusion, polymorphisms of TNFα gene both in exon and promoter regions have a strong association with the early first ovulation within 3 weeks after parturition in the <b>high-producing</b> dairy <b>cow.</b> Taken together, polymorphisms of TNFα gene could be strongly related to early first ovulation after parturition, thus being an effective tool of selection for improving reproductive performance in the <b>high-producing</b> dairy <b>cow.</b> [URL]...|$|R

Daily peak milk production decreased for all parity groups in the summer, but the effect decreased with increasing days in lactation. Use of sprinklers increased peak milk production in parity- 1 and - 3 or higher cows, but use of fans did not significantly alter effects of season.

This study aims to investigate whether {{a high level of}} milk production, and the associated metabolic status, affects HPA function in dairy cows and changes their adaptive capacity. Additionally, it aims to establish whether possible effects of milk production level only show under challenging conditions. Holstein-Friesian cows, which produced on average 11, 443 and 7727 kg of fat and protein-corrected milk (FPCM) / 305 d in their previous lactation, were compared. During the dry period, the cows were fed to requirements or overfed. High milk yield and the concomitant large energy deficit were associated with 1) increased pituitary (re) activity, i. e., increased ACTH baseline concentrations and higher ACTH concentrations after corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) administration, and 2) decreased adrenocortical reactivity, i. e., lower cortisol responses after ACTH administration. Although significant, the effects of milk production level on HPA function were relatively small. Animals showed seemingly normal hormonal responses to CRH and ACTH administration.

Cereal grains and oil supplements are commonly used for increasing energy density of diets fed to <b>high-producing</b> dairy <b>cows.</b> Dietary grain source (barley vs. corn) and oil supplement (soybean- vs. fish oil) resulted in varied dry matter intake and milk production responses in different research studies based on effects on nutrient digestibility and rumen fermentation characteristics.

40|$|During recent decades, milk {{production}} per cow has increased drastically due to improved management, nutrition, and genetic selection; however, the reproductive performance of <b>high-producing</b> dairy <b>cows</b> has been declining. One {{of the factors}} responsible for this low reproductive performance is negative energy balance (NEB). NEB affects the onset of first ovulation in early postpartum cows. It is generally accepted that early first ovulation positively relates to the resumption of normal ovarian function, first service, and conception rate in dairy cows. Hence, delayed first ovulation has {{a negative impact on}} subsequent fertility. The metabolic condition of cows in NEB shifts to catabolic metabolism, which in turn causes increased plasma growth hormone and non-esterified fatty acid concentrations and decreased plasma insulin-like growth factor- 1, insulin, and glucose concentrations. On the other hand, plasma β-carotene concentrations decrease throughout the dry period and reach their nadir in about the first week postpartum, and this change reflects energy balance during the peripartum period. β-Carotene plays a role independently of vitamin A in the reproductive performance of dairy cows, and the positive relationship between supplemental β-carotene and reproductive function has been demonstrated in many studies during the past decades. However, β-carotene content in corn silage, which is a popular main feed in <b>high-producing</b> dairy <b>cows,</b> is very low.

40|$|In dairy cattle, the {{widespread}} use of artificial insemination has resulted in increased selection intensity, which has led to spectacular increase in productivity. However, cow fertility has concomitantly severely declined. It is generally assumed that this reduction is primarily due to the negative energy balance of <b>high-producing</b> <b>cows</b> at the peak of lactation. We herein describe the fine-mapping of a major fertility QTL in Nordic Red cattle, and identify a 660 -kb deletion encompassing four genes as the causative variant. We show that the deletion is a recessive embryonically lethal mutation. This probably results from the loss of RNASEH 2 B, which is known to cause embryonic death in mice. Despite its dramatic effect on fertility, 13 %, 23 % and 32 % of the animals carry the deletion in Danish, Swedish and Finnish Red Cattle, respectively. To explain this, we searched for favorable effects on other traits and found that the deletion has strong positive effects on milk yield. This study demonstrates that embryonic lethal mutations account for a non-negligible fraction of the decline in fertility of domestic cattle, and that associated positive effects on milk yield may account for part of the negative genetic correlation.

40|$|Fluid flow in {{dual purpose}} milklines {{typically}} varies between "stratified flow " (when milk flows {{in the lower}} part of the milkline and air can flow in a clear, continuous path above the milk) and "slug flow " (when intermittent slugs of milk fill the entire cross-section of the milkline). Slug flow conditions almost always induce a transient drop in milkline vacuum greater than 2 kPa. Transient vacuum drops caused by slug flow are characterized by a rapid drop in milkline vacuum below the average stable level, and rapid recovery when the slug enters the receiver. The key performance indicator of stratified flow, therefore, is that any transient drop in milkline vacuum should not exceed 2 kPa (0. 6 " Hg) at the designed milk and air flowrates, including the transient air flows normally associated with cup changing and liner slips. Our recommendations for sizing milklines are based on this performance guideline to ensure that stratified flow is the normal flow condition for milking <b>high-producing</b> <b>cows</b> in parlors or stanchion barn installations, now and into the next decade.

The objective {{of this study was}} to perform a literature review on the use of robotic milking of dairy cows, addressing aspects such as implementation and functioning of the system and effect on milking frequency, milk production and composition, somatic cell count, mastitis, reproduction, and animal welfare. The results showed that the programming of the robot depends on the number of animals to be milked daily and on the milking frequency adopted in each batch. The implementation of the system mainly depends on the site where the facilities will be built and already existing structures on the farm. The milking frequency is higher for <b>high-producing</b> <b>cows</b> and at the beginning of lactation and is influenced by the palatability of the concentrate offered at the time of milking.

After the second year, udder health tends to improve, normalizing mastitis incidence and somatic cell count.

Concentration and ruminal digestibility of starch in rations of lactating cows has important effects on productivity. Starch is more digestible and less filling than forage fiber and provides more glucose precursors than fiber from any source. Ruminal fermentability of starch is affected by grain and endosperm type, processing and conservation method, and diet and animal factors, and affects production of fermentation acids and microbial protein in the rumen. Excessive ruminal fermentability can decrease fiber digestibility, efficiency of microbial protein production, and alter ruminal biohydrogenation, decreasing synthesis of milk fat and increasing energy partitioned to body condition {{at the expense of}} milk. The concentration and ruminal fermentability of starch affects feed intake, and energy partitioning of cows differently as they progress through lactation. <b>High-producing</b> <b>cows</b> in early to mid-lactation thrive on high-starch rations with highly fermentable starch sources while starch concentration and fermentability should decrease as lactation progresses to maintain yield of milk fat and prevent excessive body condition. Highly fermentable starch sources should be limited in rations for the first two weeks following parturition to avoid further depression in feed intake, and decrease risk of ruminal acidosis and displaced abomasum. Grouping cows by physiological state (fresh, early to mid, maintenance) is required to formulate diets for starch to optimize health and production...|$|R
40|$|Rations {{containing}} either soybean meal, raw full-fat soybeans, or processed soybeans {{were compared}} using 36 <b>high-producing</b> dairy <b>cows</b> in early lactation. The processed soybeans were heated in a California Pellet Milt Jet-Sploder for sufficient time (about 1 min) to produce beans with exit temperature of 340 °F. The raw soybeans and heated soybeans were rolled before being• mixed into the concentrate mixture. Alfalfa hay and concentrate were consumed ad libitum in {{a ratio of}} 35 % hay and 65 % concentrate. Milk production and percent protein in milk were significantly greater when cows were fed soybean meal or Jet-Sploded beans than when fed raw soybeans.

Previously we {{reported}} the isolation and structure characterization of different phenolic compounds, quercetin, kaemferol and benzoic acid derivatives (1 - 9) from whole cottonseed by-product. In this paper the antioxidant activity of all isolated compounds was determined by measuring free radical scavenging effects using the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assay and the coupled oxidation of β-carotene and linoleic acid (autoxidation assay). The range of phenolic compounds present in WCS (1. 90 g/kg), assayed by the Folin-Ciocalteu method, and their antioxidant properties provides a valuable database for possible nutritional studies on the impact of diet on animal health and productivity...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this trial was to determine lactation performance responses in <b>high-producing</b> dairy <b>cows</b> to a reduced-starch versus a normal-starch diet and to the addition of exogenous amylase to the reduced-starch diet. Forty-five multiparous Holstein cows, 68 ± 29 d in milk and 696 ± 62 kg of body weight (BW) at trial initiation, {{were randomly assigned to}} 1 of 3 treatments in a completely randomized design; a 2 -wk covariate adjustment period with cows fed the normal-starch diet was followed by a 10 -wk treatment period with cows fed their assigned treatment diets. The normalstarch total mixed ration did not contain exogenous amylase (NS−). The reduced-starch diets, formulated by partially replacing corn grain and soybean mea...|$|R
40|$|Twelve Holstein cows {{were given}} diets {{containing}} soybean supplied {{in different ways}} {{in order to identify}} possible changes in lactation performance and evaluate the economic feasibility of the diets. The diets included: soybean meal only (SM-control); raw soybean (RaS); roasted soybean (RoS) and soybean meal plus 5 % urea (SMU). The forage consisted of corn silage. We analyzed the dry matter intake, milk production and collected milk samples. To estimate digestibility, we collected six samples of feces over a period of six consecutive days. The intake of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and non-fiber carbohydrates (NFC) did not differ among treatments. On the other hand, crude protein (CP) intake was influenced by the diets, and the highest mean values of ether extract (EE) were found with the RaS and RoS diets. The intake of total digestible nutrients (TDN) was lower in the RaS and RoS diets compared to the control diet. DM, OM, CP, EE, and NDF digestibility were not affected by the different diets, while NFCs were reduced in the RoS diet and TDN decreased with both the RaS and RoS diets. There were also no differences observed across diets for total milk production, production corrected to 3. 5 % fat, diet efficiency, or milk per kilogram of dry matter and/or crude protein. We conclude that raw and roasted soybeans as well as concentrate plus 5 % urea in dry matter may be used instead of soybean meal as feed for <b>high-producing</b> <b>cows,</b> without affecting milk production and composition. We also observed that the SMU diet was the least costly...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} possible relationships between plasma concentrations of prolactin and the following factors throughout gestation in lactating dairy cows: photoperiod, season, milk production, Neospora caninum-seropositivity, twin pregnancy, and plasma concentrations of pregnancy associated glycoproteins- 1 (PAG- 1), progesterone and cortisol. Pregnancy was diagnosed by trans-rectal ultrasonography on Day 40 post-insemination and by palpation per rectum on Days 90, 120, 150, 180 and 210 or until abortion in aborting cows. Blood samples were collected from each animal immediately before each pregnancy diagnosis. The study population was comprised of 73 non-aborting (54 Neospora-seropositive cows) and 20 aborting cows (all Neospora-seropositive) cows. In non-aborting cows, GLM repeated measures of analysis of variance revealed that lactation number and days in milk had no effect on plasma prolactin concentrations throughout gestation, whereas high plasma prolactin concentrations were significantly associated with high plasma levels of cortisol and PAG- 1, with Neospora-seropositivity, positive photoperiod (increasing day length), twin pregnancy, and with low plasma progesterone concentrations. An interaction among plasma prolactin, plasma cortisol and milk production was observed in that plasma prolactin concentrations differed significantly throughout gestation and were highest in <b>high-producing</b> <b>cows</b> with high cortisol levels. In Neospora-seropositive non-aborting versus aborting cows, mean prolactin concentrations failed to differ on Days 40, 90, 120, 150 and 180 of pregnancy, whereas prolactin values were significantly lower (P= 0. 03) in aborting animals on Day 210 of pregnancy. Our results indicate that a positive photoperiod and Neospora-infection lead to increased plasma prolactin concentrations throughout gestation. Reduced prolactin concentrations detected in Neospora-seropositive aborting cows compared to non-aborting animals suggests a protective effect of prolactin in N. caninum infection.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of feeding frequency on milk production, dry matter intake (DMI) and cow behaviour on two dairy farms with conventional and automatic milking systems (AMS) in different environmental conditions. Cows on two farms were monitored. On the first farm, 96 primiparous cows were milked in a herringbone parlor while on the second a group of nearly 50 cows were milked in two AMS with a forced traffic. On each farm, treatments consisted of two different frequencies of total mixed ration (TMR) delivery (2 vs 3 on the conventional farm; 1 vs 2 on the AMS farm) replicated in two different periods of the year with THI of 72. 6 and 60. 7, respectively. The behaviour of the cows was monitored by continuous video recording. Statistical analysis was performed separately for the two farms. Increasing the frequency of TMR deliveries did not result in any variation in DMI but significantly improved milk yield on both farms. The increase in feeding frequency at the bunk in the AMS farm mitigated the negative effect of hot conditions on production with a 7. 6 % increase in milk yield. Feeding frequency did not influence cow behaviour on either farm. Hot conditions showed a depressive effect on DMI (nearly 8 % on both farms) compared with thermoneutral conditions but caused a reduction in milk yield (an average 17 %) only on the farm with multiparous <b>high-producing</b> <b>cows</b> milked automatically. In the hot period, cows on both farms showed a reduction in daily lying time and an increase in daily standing time...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that IGF-I is a crucial {{regulatory}} factor in follicular growth during early post-partum period. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine in detail the changing profiles of metabolic and reproductive hormones in relation to ovulation of the dominant follicle (DF) of the first follicular wave post-partum in <b>high-producing</b> dairy <b>cows.</b> Plasma concentrations of related hormones in 22 multiparous Holstein cows were measured from 4 weeks pre-partum to 3 weeks post-partum, and the development of DF was observed with colour Doppler ultrasound. Thirteen cows showed ovulation by 15. 2 days post-partum. Anovulatory cows showed higher GH and lower IGF-I levels than those in ovulatory cows during the peri-partum period. Each DF developed similarly, and a clear blood flow in the follicle wall was observed despite ovulation or anovulation. In addition, detailed endocrine profiles were analyzed in 9 out of the 22 cows. Five cows showed an increase in plasma oestradiol- 17 β (E 2) with follicular growth followed by E 2 peak, LH surge and ovulation. In these cows, plasma IGF-I concentrations remained high until 10 days post-partum followed by a gradual decrease. Subsequently, the insulin level increased together with the E 2 peak towards ovulation. These profiles were not observed in anovulatory cows. In conclusion, our data strongly support the concept that IGF-I and insulin represent 'metabolic signals' of the resumption of ovarian function post-partum in <b>high-producing</b> dairy <b>cows.</b> Moreover, we provide the first visual evidence that both ovulatory and anovulatory DFs of the first follicular wave post-partum are similarly supplied with active blood flow. © 2007 Society for Reproduction and Fertility...|$|R
25|$|Its {{primary use}} is as feed for <b>high-producing</b> dairy <b>cows,</b> {{because of its}} high protein content and highly {{digestible}} fiber, and secondarily for beef cattle, horses, sheep, and goats. Alfalfa hay is a widely used protein and fiber source for meat rabbits. In poultry diets, dehydrated alfalfa and alfalfa leaf concentrates are used for pigmenting eggs and meat, because of their high content in carotenoids, which are efficient for colouring egg yolk and body lipids. Humans also eat alfalfa sprouts in salads and sandwiches. Dehydrated alfalfa leaf is commercially available as a dietary supplement in several forms, such as tablets, powders and tea. Fresh alfalfa can cause bloating in livestock, so {{care must be taken}} with livestock grazing on alfalfa because of this hazard.|$|R
