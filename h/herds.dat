5|$|Springbok {{are mainly}} active around dawn and dusk. Activity is {{influenced}} by weather; springbok can feed at night in hot weather, and at midday in colder months. They rest {{in the shade of}} trees or bushes, and often bed down in the open when weather is cooler. The social structure of the springbok {{is similar to that of}} Thomson's gazelle. Mixed-sex <b>herds</b> or harems have a roughly 3:1 sex ratio; bachelor individuals are also observed. In the mating season, males generally form <b>herds</b> and wander in search of mates. Females live with their offspring in <b>herds,</b> that very rarely include dominant males. Territorial males round up female <b>herds</b> that enter their territories and keep out the bachelors; mothers and juveniles may gather in nursery <b>herds</b> separate from harem and bachelor <b>herds.</b> After weaning, female juveniles stay with their mothers until the birth of their next calves, while males join bachelor groups.|$|E
5|$|Common elands are nomadic and crepuscular. They eat in {{the morning}} and evening, rest in shade when hot and remain in {{sunlight}} when cold. They are commonly found in <b>herds</b> of up to 500, with individual members remaining in the herd anywhere from several hours to several months. Juveniles and mothers tend to form larger <b>herds,</b> while males may separate into smaller groups or wander individually. During estrus, mainly in the rainy season, groups tend to form more regularly. In southern Africa common elands will often associate with <b>herds</b> of zebras, roan antelopes and oryxes.|$|E
5|$|During the rut, males {{establish}} territories, {{ranging from}} , which they mark by urinating and depositing large piles of dung. Males in neighbouring territories frequently fight {{for access to}} females, which they do by twisting and levering {{at each other with}} their horns, interspersed with stabbing attacks. Females roam the territories of different males. Outside of the rut, mixed-sex <b>herds</b> can range from as few as three to as many as 180 individuals, while all-male bachelor <b>herds</b> are of typically no more than 50 individuals. Harem and nursery <b>herds</b> are much smaller, typically including no more than 10 individuals.|$|E
50|$|The vast {{majority}} of <b>herding</b> dogs, as household pets, never cross paths with a farm animal. Nevertheless, pure instinct prompts many of these dogs to gently <b>herd</b> their owners, especially {{the children of the}} family. In general, these intelligent dogs make excellent companions and respond beautifully to training exercises. Consequently urban owners with no access to livestock can train <b>herding</b> commands through <b>herding</b> games. Furthermore, <b>herding</b> instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive <b>herding</b> tests. <b>Herding</b> dogs that exhibit basic <b>herding</b> instincts can be trained to compete in <b>herding</b> trials.|$|R
50|$|Some animals instinctively gather {{together}} as a <b>herd.</b> A group of animals fleeing a predator will demonstrate <b>herd</b> behavior for protection; while some predators, such as wolves and dogs have instinctive <b>herding</b> abilities derived from primitive hunting instincts. Instincts in <b>herding</b> dogs and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive <b>herding</b> tests. Dogs exhibiting basic <b>herding</b> instincts can be trained to aid in <b>herding</b> and to compete in <b>herding</b> and stock dog trials. Sperm whales have also been observed teaming up to <b>herd</b> prey in a coordinated feeding behavior.|$|R
40|$|Introduction of {{an animal}} from a <b>herd</b> with Q-fever into another <b>herd,</b> can {{increase}} the risk to animal and public health. For the infected <b>herd</b> from which the animal originates (the source <b>herd)</b> the risk depends on the possibility that an animal from an infected <b>herd</b> will excrete the bacterium, and the extent and duration of excretion. For the receiving <b>herd</b> (target <b>herd)</b> the infection status and speed of transmission of the bacterium in the <b>herd</b> are determining factors...|$|R
5|$|In earlier times, when large {{populations of}} {{springbok}} roamed the Kalahari desert and Karoo, millions of migrating springbok formed <b>herds</b> hundreds of kilometres long {{that could take}} several days to pass a town. These mass treks, known as trekbokken in Afrikaans, took place during long periods of drought. <b>Herds</b> could efficiently retrace their paths to their territories after long migrations. Trekbokken is still observed occasionally in Botswana, though on a much smaller scale than earlier.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} ceratopsians, {{especially}} Centrosaurus and its relatives, {{appear to have}} been gregarious, living in <b>herds.</b> This is suggested by bonebed finds with the remains of many individuals of different ages. Like modern migratory <b>herds,</b> they would have had a significant effect on their environment, as well as serving as a major food source for predators.|$|E
5|$|The black {{wildebeest}} is a gregarious {{animal with}} a complex social structure comprising three distinct groups : firstly, the female <b>herds,</b> consisting of adult females and their young; secondly, the bachelor <b>herds,</b> consisting only of yearlings and older males; thirdly, the territorial bulls. The number of females per herd is variable, generally ranging from 14 to 32, but is {{highest in the}} densest populations and also increases with forage density. There is a strong attachment {{among members of the}} female herd, many of whom are related to each other. Large <b>herds</b> often get divided into smaller groups. While small calves stay with their mothers, the older ones form groups of their own within the herd. These <b>herds</b> have a social hierarchy, and the females are rather aggressive towards others trying to join the group. Young males are generally repelled by their mothers before the calving season starts. Separation of a young calf from its mother can be a major cause of calf mortality. While some male yearlings stay within the female herd, the others join a bachelor herd. These are usually loose associations and, unlike the female <b>herds,</b> the individuals are not much attached to each other. Another difference between the female and bachelor <b>herds</b> is the lesser aggression {{on the part of the}} males. These bachelor <b>herds</b> move widely in the available habitat and act as a refuge for males that have been unsuccessful as territorial bulls, and also as a reserve for future breeding males.|$|E

5|$|A {{study of}} {{vigilance}} behaviour of <b>herds</b> revealed that individuals on {{the borders of}} <b>herds</b> {{tend to be more}} cautious; vigilance decreases with group size. Group size and distance from roads and bushes were found to have major influence on vigilance, more among the grazing springbok than among their browsing counterparts. Adults were found to be more vigilant than juveniles, and males more vigilant than females. Springbok passing through bushes tend to be more vulnerable to predator attacks as they can not be easily alerted, and predators usually conceal themselves in bushes. Another study calculated that the time spent in vigilance by springbok on the edges of <b>herds</b> is roughly double that spent by those in the centre and the open. Springbok were found to be more cautious in the late morning than at dawn or in the afternoon, and more at night than in the daytime. Rates and methods of vigilance were found to vary with the aim of lowering risk from predators.|$|E

5|$|Active mainly {{during the}} day, the impala may be gregarious or {{territorial}} {{depending upon the}} climate and geography. Three distinct social groups can be observed: the territorial males, bachelor <b>herds</b> and female <b>herds.</b> The impala is known for two characteristic leaps that constitute an anti-predator strategy. Browsers as well as grazers, impala feed on monocots, dicots, forbs, fruits and acacia pods (whenever available). An annual, three-week-long rut takes place {{toward the end of}} the wet season, typically in May. Rutting males fight over dominance, and the victorious male courts female in oestrus. Gestation lasts six to seven months, following which a single calf is born and immediately concealed in cover. Calves are suckled for four to six months; young males—forced out of the all-female groups—join bachelor <b>herds,</b> while females may stay back.|$|E

5|$|Bok began {{a ten-year}} period of slavery {{at the hands}} of Giemma and his son Hamid. He was forced to tend the family's <b>herds</b> of livestock. He had to take them to {{pastures}} in the area and to local watering holes, where he saw other Dinka boys who were also forced to tend <b>herds</b> of livestock. He began to suspect that his life was going to change forever and that his father {{was not going to be}} able to save him. His attempts to speak to the other Dinka boys were futile, as they were speaking Arabic, which he could not understand; they also seemed afraid to speak to him.|$|E
5|$|Crossbred cows produce up to, and in {{some cases}} in excess of, 20% more weaned calf weight as a result of {{increased}} reproductive performance and maternal ability. Crossbred cow longevity is also increased by up to two years when compared with straightbred cows. However, the benefits of hybrid vigour in a crossbred cow decline in subsequent generations if progeny are mated to cattle of parentage similar to the cow, and increase if a new breed is introduced. Although studies acknowledge that the major production benefits of hybrid vigour occur in crossbred cow <b>herds,</b> the main use of Limousins outside of Europe continues to be as terminal sires in purebred British breed cow <b>herds.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>Herds</b> {{of red and}} {{fallow deer}} also roam freely within much of Richmond and Bushy Park. A cull takes place each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained. Epping Forest is also known for its fallow deer, which can {{frequently}} be seen in <b>herds</b> {{to the north of}} the Forest. A rare population of melanistic, black fallow deer is also maintained at the Deer Sanctuary near Theydon Bois. Muntjac deer, which escaped from deer parks at the turn of the twentieth century, are also found in the forest. While Londoners are accustomed to wildlife such as birds and foxes sharing the city, more recently urban deer have started becoming a regular feature, and whole <b>herds</b> of fallow and white-tailed deer come into residential areas at night to take advantage of London's green spaces.|$|E
5|$|It {{has often}} been claimed that ceratopsian dinosaurs were herding animals, due to {{the large number of}} known bone beds {{containing}} multiple members of the same ceratopsian species. In 2010, Hunt and Farke pointed out that this was mainly true for centrosaurine ceratopsians. Horner assumed that the horned dinosaurs at Landslide Butte lived in <b>herds</b> that had been killed by drought or disease. Dodson concluded that the fact that the Achelousaurus bone beds were monospecific (containing only one species) confirmed the existence of <b>herds.</b>|$|E
5|$|Kiger Mustangs {{are most}} often dun in color, {{although}} they are found in other solid colors. Compact and well-muscled in appearance, their coloration and phenotype make them {{some of the most}} desired by private buyers when horses are removed from the feral <b>herds.</b> The BLM rounds up the horses from the two herd management areas every three to four years, and auctions excess horses to the public, returning horses to public lands that meet the desired coloration and phenotype and sometimes exchanging horses between the two <b>herds</b> to maintain genetic diversity. Horses in private ownership may be registered in several breed associations, the largest and oldest being the Kiger Mesteño Association, established in 1988.|$|E
