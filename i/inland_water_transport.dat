Large reservoirs with higher areal methane release rates than natural waters contribute significantly to freshwater emissions. However, {{there are millions of}} small dams worldwide that receive and trap high loads of organic carbon and can therefore potentially emit significant amounts of methane to the atmosphere. We evaluated the effect of damming on methane emissions in a central European impounded river. Direct comparison of riverine and reservoir reaches, where sedimentation in the latter is increased due to trapping by dams, revealed that the reservoir reaches are the major source of methane emissions (~ 0. 23 mmol CH 4 m(- 2) d(- 1) vs. ~ 19. 7 mmol CH 4 m(- 2) d(- 1) respectively), and that areal emission rates far exceed previous estimates for temperate reservoirs or rivers. We show that sediment accumulation correlates with methane production and subsequent ebullitive release rates and may therefore be an excellent proxy for estimating methane emissions from small reservoirs. Our results suggest that sedimentation-driven methane emissions from dammed river hotspot sites can potentially increase global freshwater emissions by up to 7 %...|$|R
40|$|The {{rich history}} of water- based {{transportation}} {{that existed in}} the past in the country has diminished over the years. The waterways that were used mainly for freight transportation are neglected and under utilized. Thus a transport infrastructure, which is readily available for use is an asset for the transport planners, searching for alternatives to ease the ever-increasing congestion on roads where mere expansion of infrastructure has become difficult. The objective of this thesis was to investigate the technical and financial feasibility of a waterborne public transportation system on existing inland waterways in the Colombo Metropolitan Region. The research starts by first looking abroad, where <b>inland</b> <b>water</b> <b>transports</b> systems area more familiar concept to find on what capacity they operated. Secondary the study area was defined so that continues waterway links can be formed. Data on physical parameters were gathered on which water way systems in the CMRwere identified. A complete technical feasibility on five selected waterway systems were presented under which the two systems; Wellawatte – Kirillapone Canal and Biera Lake were identified as meeting the criterion defined for technical feasibility, out of which the former system was selected as the best route for a public transport system in CMR. Nonavailability of demand estimation models and vehicle operating costs for boats deprived a complete assessment on financial feasibility. The conclusion arrived is that it is technically feasible to make a connection over water, certainly in the in Wellawatte- Kirillapone link where the daily passenger movements are considerably high. Its financial feasibility depends on the estimation of demand and operational parameters for the ferry service, which require further research...|$|R

40|$|<b>Inland</b> <b>waters</b> <b>transport</b> {{large amounts}} of {{dissolved}} organic matter (DOM) from terrestrial environments to the oceans, but DOM also reacts en route, with substantial water column losses by mineralization and sedimentation. For DOM transformations along the aquatic continuum, lakes {{play an important role}} as they retain waters in the landscape allowing for more time to alter DOM. We know DOM losses are significant at the global scale, yet little is known about how the reactivity of DOM varies across landscapes and climates. DOM reactivity is inherently linked to its chemical composition. We used fluorescence spectroscopy to explore DOM quality from 560 lakes distributed across Sweden and encompassed a wide climatic gradient typical of the boreal ecozone. Six fluorescence components were identified using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). The intensity and relative abundance of these components were analyzed in relation to lake chemistry, catchment, and climate characteristics. Land cover, particularly the percentage of water in the catchment, was a primary factor explaining variability in PARAFAC components. Likewise, lake water retention time influenced DOM quality. These results suggest that processes occurring in upstream water bodies, in addition to the lake itself, have a dominant influence on DOM quality. PARAFAC components with longer emission wavelengths, or red-shifted components, were most reactive. In contrast, protein-like components were most persistent within lakes. Generalized characteristics of PARAFAC components based on emission wavelength could ease future interpretation of fluorescence spectra. An important secondary influence on DOM quality was mean annual temperature, which ranged between − 6. 2 and + 7. 5  °C. These results suggest that DOM reactivity depends more heavily on the duration of time taken to pass through the landscape, rather than temperature. Projected increases in runoff in the boreal region may force lake DOM toward a higher overall amount and proportion of humic-like substances...|$|R
