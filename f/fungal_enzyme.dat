25|$|The {{imperfect}} fungus Tubakia dryina Sutton is a leaf parasite {{reported to}} occur {{on a wide}} range of host plants, including species of Sweet Gum (Liquidambar styraciflua L.). Limber and Cash reported that leaf spots produced by this pathogen on several different genera of forest trees were 2–5mm diameter with regular margins. During the summer of 1994 in the Nacogdoches County area of Texas, a prominent leaf spot on Sweet Gum was widespread. Infected leaves had numerous necrotic lesions, each surrounded by a reddish halo. The lesions tended to merge resulting in large areas of dead tissue. Infection and fungal development of D.dryina were investigated on leaves of sweet gum using a combination of microscopic techniques. D.dryina infection on Sweet Gum has been associated with the disease red leaf spot. Results of this investigation indicate that D.dryina can penetrate leaf tissue directly, thus having the ability to initiate infection on both upper and lower leaf surfaces. In other regions of the U.S., Sweet Gum populations may not be as susceptible to local populations of this fungus. Environmental stress factors may also be involved, as reports have indicated that herbicide application and chlorosis caused by iron deficiency may increase susceptibility of Dicarpella dryina. Tannins (a type of biomolecule found in trees to protect it from fire, insects, and bacteria) have been reported to occur in healthy tissue of a variety of plants including sweet gum. They may prevent pathogen invasion by inhibiting <b>fungal</b> <b>enzyme</b> activity. Although cells of healthy sweet gum tissue appear rich in tannins, these materials apparently were not effective in preventing fungal colonization by D.dryina.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{important}} routes {{for the production of}} zirconia is by chemical treatment and removal of silica from zircon sand (ZrSixOy). We present here a completely green chemistry approach toward enrichment of zirconia in zircon sand; this is based on the reaction of the fungus Fusarium oxysporum with zircon sand by a process of selective extracellular bioleaching of silica nanoparticles. Since this reaction does not result in zirconia being simultaneously leached out from the sand, there is a consequent enrichment of the zirconia component in zircon sand. We believe that <b>fungal</b> <b>enzymes</b> specifically hydrolyze the silicates present in the sand to form silicic acid, which on condensation by certain other <b>fungal</b> <b>enzymes</b> results in room-temperature synthesis of silica nanoparticles.

50|$|In {{anaerobic}} {{bacteria that}} degrade plant cell walls, exemplified by Clostridium thermocellum, the dockerin domains of the catalytic polypeptides can bind equally well to any cohesin {{from the same}} organism.

For example, the <b>fungal</b> <b>enzymes</b> contain one, two or three copies of the dockerin sequence in tandem within the catalytic polypeptide. In contrast, all the C. thermocellum cellulosome catalytic components contain a single dockerin domain. The anaerobic bacterial dockerins are homologous to EF hands (calcium-binding motifs) and require calcium for activity whereas the fungal dockerin does not require calcium. Finally, the interaction between cohesin and dockerin appears to be species specific in bacteria, {{there is almost no}} species specificity of binding within fungal species and no identified sites that distinguish different species.|$|R

40|$|Aspergillus niger strain LCP 521 {{harbours}} {{a highly}} processive epoxide hydrolase (EH) {{that is of}} particular interest for the enantioselective bio-organic synthesis of fine chemicals. In the present work, we report the isolation of the gene and cDNA for this EH by use of inverse PCR. The gene is composed of nine exons, the first of which is apparently non-coding. The deduced protein of the A. niger EH shares significant sequence similarity with the mammalian microsomal EHs (mEH). In contrast to these, however, the protein from A. niger lacks the common N-terminal membrane anchor, in line with the fact that this enzyme is, indeed, soluble in its native environment. Recombinant expression of the isolated cDNA in Escherichia coli yielded a fully active EH with similar characteristics to the <b>fungal</b> <b>enzyme.</b> Sequence comparison with mammalian EHs suggested that Asp(192), Asp(348) and His(374) constituted the catalytic triad of the fungal EH. This was subsequently substantiated by the analysis of respective mutants constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. The presence of an aspartic acid residue in the charge-relay system of the A. niger enzyme, in contrast to a glutamic acid residue in the respective position of all mEHs analysed to date, may be one important contributor to the exceptionally high turnover number of the <b>fungal</b> <b>enzyme</b> when compared with its mammalian relatives.

40|$|An {{extracellular}} elastinolytic metalloproteinase, purified from Aspergillus fumigatus {{isolated from}} an aspergillosis and patient/and an internal peptide derived from it {{were subjected to}} N-terminal sequencing. Oligonucleotide primers based on these sequences were used to PCR amplify {{a segment of the}} metalloproteinase cDNA, which was used as a probe to isolate the cDNA and gene for this enzyme. The gene sequence matched exactly with the cDNA sequence except for the four introns that interrupted the open reading frame. According to the deduced amino acid sequence, the metalloproteinase has a signal sequence and 227 additional amino acids preceding the sequence for the mature protein of 389 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 42 kDa, which is close {{to the size of the}} purified mature fungal proteinase. This sequence contains segments that matched both the N terminus of the mature protein and the internal peptide. A. fumigatus metalloproteinase contains some of the conserved zinc-binding and active-site motifs characteristic of metalloproteinases but shows no overall homology with known metalloproteinases. The cDNA of the mature protein when introduced into Escherichia coli directed the expression of a protein with a size, N-terminal sequence, and immunological cross-reactivity identical to those of the native <b>fungal</b> <b>enzyme.</b> Although the enzyme in the inclusion bodies could not be renatured, expression at 30 degrees C yielded soluble enzyme that showed chromatographic behavior identical to that of the native <b>fungal</b> <b>enzyme</b> and catalyzed hydrolysis of elastin.

40|$|Abstract Enzymatic {{degradation}} of plant polysaccharides has many industrial applications, such as within the paper, food, and feed industry and for sustainable production of fuels and chemicals. Cellulose, hemicelluloses, and pectins {{are the main}} components of plant cell wall polysaccharides. These polysaccharides are often tightly packed, contain many different sugar residues, and are branched with a diversity of structures. To enable efficient {{degradation of}} these polysaccharides, fungi produce an extensive set of carbohydrate-active enzymes.

Carbohydrate-active enzymes can be organized in different families based on the amino acid sequence of the structurally related catalytic modules. <b>Fungal</b> <b>enzymes</b> involved in plant polysaccharide degradation are assigned to at least 35 glycoside hydrolase families, three carbohydrate esterase families and six polysaccharide lyase families.
