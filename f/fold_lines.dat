40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{processing}} {{characteristics and}} difficulties of drum with <b>fold</b> <b>line</b> grooves are analyzed. Three kinds of CNC machining methods, namely three-axis linkage, single-axis servo and two-axis servo, are introduced. With CNC machining methods of single-axis servo and two-axis servo, the spindle motor of machine tool needs not to transform. A CNC system is developed which acquires the absolute {{position on the}} circle of drum through the spindle encoder and spindle zero position switch. It allows simultaneous servo position and velocity control of Z-axis AC servo motor or both Z-axis and X-axis AC servo motors. With the changes of angular displacement of spindle, the system manages the interpolation motion of X-axis and Z axis, so drums with <b>fold</b> <b>line</b> grooves {{can be achieved by}} this way. Both of these methods have been applied to transformation of machine tool with simple, economical and reliable operation. This paper also proposes three methods to improve the processing efficiency of the drum: increasing a function of return to zero rapidly, processing with more tools at the same time, processing external steel sleeve with <b>fold</b> <b>line</b> grooves and then installing it on a smooth drum...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Computational origami is the {{computer}} assisted study of origami as {{a branch of}} science of shapes. The origami construction is a countably finite sequence of fold steps, each consisting in <b>folding</b> along a <b>line.</b> In this paper, we formalize origami construction. We model origami paper {{by a set of}} faces over which we specify relations of overlay and adjacency. A <b>fold</b> <b>line</b> is determined by a specific fold method. After folding along the <b>fold</b> <b>line,</b> the structure of origami is transformed; some faces are divided and moved, new faces are created and therefore the relations over the faces change. We give a formal method to construct the model origami. The model furthermore induces a graph of layers of faces. We give two origami examples as the application of our model. They exhibit non-trivial aspects of origami which are revealed only by formal modeling. The model is the abstraction of the implemented core of the system of computational origami called Eos (E-origami system). ...|$|R

For this purpose, the direct calculation of the so-called <b>fold</b> <b>line</b> connecting all the limit points of the equilibrium branches when the imperfection varies is performed. This <b>fold</b> <b>line</b> is the solution of an extended system demanding the criticality of the equilibrium. The Asymptotic Numerical Method is used as an alternative to Newton-like incremental-iterative procedures for solving this extended system.

Two specific types of imperfections are detailed and several numerical examples are discussed...|$|R
