5|$|In 2011 {{the police}} force had 746,464 {{assignments}}, the most common with 180,000 assignments being investigation cases, such as reported deaths, controls and reports of motor vehicle theft. This was followed by traffic assignments, public <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> peace, animal cases, theft, private <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> peace, and sickness and psychiatry. Seventy-five percent of assignments are solved with a single patrol, while ninety percent are solved with one and two. In armed situations only twenty percent are solved with a single patrol. In 2010 the Norwegian Police Service had 13 billion Norwegian krone in costs, of which seventy percent was used on wages. It employed 13,493 man-years, or 1.6 man-years per 1000 residents. There were 394,137 reported offenses, or 81.1 per 1000 people, of which 46 percent were solved. There were 5,399 debt settlements, 226,491 applications for writ of execution, 195,345 immigration cases and 4,615 forced returns.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{chart the}} subtle {{neurological}} abnormalities {{in patients with}} asbestosis relative to possible development of cancer. METHODS: In 1979 - 81 a standardised neurological examination was made of 115 patients with asbestosis who carried {{a high risk of}} occupational cancer and their cancer morbidity was analysed 15 years later. RESULTS: Slight <b>disturbances</b> <b>of</b> unknown aetiology were found in the central nervous system (CNS) of 33 and in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) of 41 patients. Of these 17 had <b>disturbances</b> <b>of</b> both the CNS and PNS. This cohort was followed up to the end of 1994. During this time 47 of the patients developed cancer. Statistical analyses showed that <b>disturbances</b> <b>of</b> the CNS such as psycho-organic syndrome, cerebellar dysfunction, and motor <b>disturbances</b> <b>of</b> unknown origin were significantly associated with cancer, whereas no such association was found for peripheral neuropathy. Interaction between the radiological progression <b>of</b> asbestosis and <b>disturbances</b> <b>of</b> the CNS was an even stronger predictor of cancer. CONCLUSIONS: It seems that slight <b>disturbances</b> <b>of</b> the CNS are predictors of development of cancer. Whether or not these <b>disturbances</b> are manifestations <b>of</b> involvement of a paraneoplastic nervous system or some factor associated with progression of asbestosis remains open...|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} {{children}} were killed, injured or orphaned by the violence. Organisations such as Citizens' Initiative reported that the violence resulted in the <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> children's studies {{and that there was}} a lack of counselling. Students at Gujarat University were unable to take examinations, which were cancelled due to the chances of disruption. While other schools in the state had to postpone or cancel exams, it was reported that some schools held examinations under police protection. It was also reported that many students were forced to leave their studies due to lack of funds or to earn a livelihood because they had lost income-earning members of their families.|$|E
5|$|Cultivation {{from seed}} may be {{difficult}} or easy, depending on the species. The more difficult species to grow include the ones that require a period of dormancy or smoke treatment to simulate a bushfire.

It {{should also be noted}} that they appear to be sensitive to <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> their root systems. Minimization of such disturbance will likely result in healthier plants.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Ernest {{was one of}} two intense {{tropical}} cyclones in the 2004–05 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season. The eighth tropical <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> the season, Ernest {{formed from}} a persistent area of thunderstorms in the central Indian Ocean. It initially moved southwestward, intensifying into Tropical Storm Ernest on January20 while moving into the Mozambique Channel. After hitting Mayotte, the storm quickly intensified to reach peak winds of 165km/h (105mph 10minute winds) off the western coast of Madagascar. Ernest weakened slightly before striking the southwest portion of that country on January23, producing widespread flooding and gusty winds. The next day the cyclone became extratropical before dissipating on January25.|$|E
5|$|During {{the season}} at least 16 {{people were killed}} from {{tropical}} disturbances whilst overall damage was estimated at $ (2004USD; $ USD). The most damaging tropical disturbance was Cyclone Heta which caused at least $ (2004USD; $ USD) in damage to six different countries and left three dead. The deadliest tropical <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> the season was Tropical Depression 10F, which was responsible for eleven deaths and caused $ (2004USD; $ USD) in damage. Cyclone Ivy also caused 2 deaths and caused $ (2004USD; $ USD) worth of damage to Vanuatu. As {{a result of the}} impacts caused by Heta and Ivy, the names were retired from the tropical cyclone naming lists.|$|E
5|$|Mild {{impairment}} {{of attention and}} concentration may occur in any mental illness where people are anxious and distractible (including psychotic states), but more extensive cognitive abnormalities are likely to indicate a gross <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> brain functioning such as delirium, dementia or intoxication. Specific language abnormalities {{may be associated with}} pathology in Wernicke's area or Broca's area of the brain. In Korsakoff's syndrome there is dramatic memory impairment with relative preservation of other cognitive functions.|$|E

5|$|Most tern {{species are}} declining in numbers {{due to the}} loss or <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> {{breeding}} habitat, pollution and increased predation. Gull populations have increased {{over the last century}} because of reduced persecution and the availability of food from human activities, and terns have been forced out of many traditional nesting areas by the larger birds. A few species are defying the trend and showing local increases, including the Arctic tern in Scandinavia, Forster's tern around the Great Lakes, the Sandwich tern in eastern North America and its yellow-billed subspecies, the Cayenne tern, in the Caribbean.|$|E
5|$|Other {{human factors}} {{have led to}} declines and even extinctions in seabird populations, colonies and species. Of these, perhaps the most serious are {{introduced}} species. Seabirds, breeding predominantly on small isolated islands, have lost many predator defence behaviours. Feral cats are capable of taking seabirds as large as albatrosses, and many introduced rodents, such as the Pacific rat, can take eggs hidden in burrows. Introduced goats, cattle, rabbits and other herbivores can lead to problems, particularly when species need vegetation to protect or shade their young. <b>Disturbance</b> <b>of</b> breeding colonies by humans is often a problem as well—visitors, even well-meaning tourists, can flush brooding adults off a colony leaving chicks and eggs vulnerable to predators.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the days}} of the stage road {{avalanches}} and rockfalls often forced closures of the highway, partly due to the massive <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> the land during the road's construction. No attempt was made to remedy this until shortly after the automobile road was built. In the 1930s, as a relief project during the Great Depression, a crew from the Civilian Conservation Corps replanted the slopes around Independence, by then abandoned for two decades.|$|E

5|$|The 1994–95 South Pacific cyclone {{season was}} one of the least active South Pacific {{tropical}} cyclone season's on record, with only two tropical cyclones officially occurring within the South Pacific Ocean basin between 160°E and 120°W. The season ran from November 1, 1994, until April 30, 1995, with the first <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> the season developing on November 12 and the last disturbance dissipating on March 17. The most intense tropical cyclone during the season was Tropical Cyclone William, which affected the Cook Islands. After the season the name William was retired from the tropical cyclone naming lists.|$|E
5|$|The 2003–04 South Pacific cyclone {{season was}} a below-average season {{with only three}} {{tropical}} cyclones occurring within the South Pacific {{to the east of}} 160°E.

5|$|To reach {{all points}} {{designated}} by the Admiralty for longitude measurements, it was sometimes necessary to take chronometers ashore, across inlets and up rivers too shallow for the ship.
