5|$|In {{the game}} the player {{controls}} Meat Boy, a red, cube-shaped character, as he attempts to rescue his girlfriend, Bandage Girl, from the game's antagonist Dr. Fetus. The gameplay is characterized by <b>fine</b> <b>control</b> and split-second timing as the player runs and jumps through over 300hazardous levels while avoiding obstacles. Additional player-created levels are available for free download.|$|E
5|$|Chemical vapor {{deposition}} is {{a method}} by which diamond can be grown from a hydrocarbon gas mixture. Since the early 1980s, this method {{has been the subject}} of intensive worldwide research. Whereas the mass-production of high-quality diamond crystals make the HPHT process the more suitable choice for industrial applications, the flexibility and simplicity of CVD setups explain the popularity of CVD growth in laboratory research. The advantages of CVD diamond growth include the ability to grow diamond over large areas and on various substrates, and the <b>fine</b> <b>control</b> over the chemical impurities and thus properties of the diamond produced. Unlike HPHT, CVD process does not require high pressures, as the growth typically occurs at pressures under 27 kPa.|$|E
5|$|Flies {{are capable}} of great {{manoeuvrability}} during flight due {{to the presence of}} the halteres. These act as gyroscopic organs and are rapidly oscillated in time with the wings; they act as a balance and guidance system by providing rapid feedback to the wing-steering muscles, and flies deprived of their halteres are unable to fly. The wings and halteres move in synchrony but the amplitude of each wing beat is independent, allowing the fly to turn sideways. The wings of the fly are attached to two kinds of muscles, those used to power it and another set used for <b>fine</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{common problem}} facing roboticists is the {{creation}} of <b>fine</b> <b>controlled</b> actions for a robot that must be interspersed with a baseline motion. We define a <b>fine</b> <b>controlled</b> action to be one in which small errors can make the di#erence in {{the success or failure of}} the action. A baseline motion is one that is executed repeatedly over time, such as walking straight or remaining idle. We examine the considerations that can a#ect the success of a <b>fine</b> <b>controlled</b> action that transitions between baseline motions. We introduce a general technique for implementing a <b>fine</b> <b>controlled</b> action that transitions from and to a baseline motion using the example of pushing an elevator button. We implement this technique in the area of robotic soccer. Our results demonstrate that this technique can successfully create <b>fine</b> <b>controlled</b> actions for a robot...|$|R

5|$|Super Meat Boy is a {{platform}} {{game in which}} players control a small, dark red, cube-shaped character named Meat Boy, who must save his cube-shaped, heavily bandaged girlfriend Bandage Girl from the evil scientist Dr. Fetus. The game is divided into chapters, which together contain over 300 levels. Players attempt to {{reach the end of}} each level, represented by Bandage Girl, while avoiding crumbling blocks, saw blades, and various other fatal obstacles. The player can jump and run on platforms, and can jump off or slide down walls. The core gameplay requires <b>fine</b> <b>control</b> and split-second timing, and was compared to, regarding both gameplay and level of difficulty, traditional platform games such as Super Mario Bros. and Ghosts 'n Goblins.|$|E
25|$|Thyristors {{are used}} in various classes of railway rolling stock systems so that <b>fine</b> <b>control</b> of the {{traction}} motors can be achieved. Gate turn-off thyristors are used to produce alternating current from a DC supply, for example on the Eurostar Trains to power the three-phase traction motors.|$|E
25|$|Virtual reality {{also has}} {{applications}} in the physical side of occupational therapy. For stroke patients, various virtual reality technologies can help bring <b>fine</b> <b>control</b> back to different muscle groups. Therapy often includes games controlled with haptic-feedback controllers that require fine movements, such as playing piano with a virtual hand. The Wii gaming system has also been {{used in conjunction with}} virtual reality as a treatment method.|$|E

Jet flow gates are able to handle heads up to 150 m.|$|E
25|$|Personal {{mobility}} {{is enhanced}} by fins and optionally diver propulsion vehicles. Fins have a large blade area and use the more powerful leg muscles, so are much more efficient for propulsion and manoeuvring thrust than arm and hand movements, but require skill to provide <b>fine</b> <b>control.</b> Several types of fin are available, {{some of which may}} be more suited for maneuvering, alternative kick styles, speed, endurance, reduced effort or ruggedness.|$|E

25|$|To {{keep the}} Shadow King imprisoned in the Astral Plane, Psylocke sacrificed {{the use of}} her telepathy, {{but at some point}} gained Phoenix's telekinesis instead. At first, due to the {{relative}} newness of her telekinesis, she could not exercise <b>fine</b> <b>control</b> over her powers, e.g. she could blast an enemy through a brick wall, but could not levitate small objects, like a dime, from the floor. As time progressed, Psylocke grew more proficient at using her powers, e.g. she could use her telekinesis to reshape a pistol into smaller metal projectiles.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other insects, {{the wing}} {{muscles of the}} Ephemeroptera (Mayflies) and Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) insert {{directly}} at the wing bases, which are hinged so that a small movement of the wing base downward, lifts the wing itself upward, very much like rowing through the air. Dragonflies and damselflies have fore and hind wings similar in shape and size. Each operates independently, which gives a degree of <b>fine</b> <b>control</b> and mobility {{in terms of the}} abruptness with which they can change direction and speed, not seen in other flying insects. This is not surprising, given that odonates are all aerial predators, and they have always hunted other airborne insects.|$|E
25|$|In computing, a mouse is a {{pointing}} device that functions by detecting two-dimensional motion relative to its supporting surface. The mouse's motion typically translates into {{the motion of}} a pointer on a display, which allows for <b>fine</b> <b>control</b> of a Graphical User Interface. Douglas Engelbart invented the computer mouse at the Augmentation Research Center, funded by the Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (now DARPA) in 1963. The first mouse was carved from wood and tracked motion via two wheels mounted on the bottom. Later on, a ball instead of two wheels was employed. The concept was soon overtaken by a modern and more technologically advanced optical mouse.|$|E

25|$|The {{symmetry}} of the hand-axes {{has been used}} to suggest that Acheulean tool users possessed the ability to use language; the parts of the brain connected with <b>fine</b> <b>control</b> and movement are located in the same region that controls speech. The wider variety of tool types compared to earlier industries and their aesthetically as well as functionally pleasing form could indicate a higher intellectual level in Acheulean tool users than in earlier hominines. Others argue that there is no correlation between spatial abilities in tool making and linguistic behaviour, and that language is not learned or conceived {{in the same manner as}} artefact manufacture.|$|E
25|$|The reticulospinal tracts, {{also known}} as the {{descending}} or anterior reticulospinal tracts, are extrapyramidal motor tracts that descend from the reticular formation in two tracts to act on the motor neurons supplying the trunk and proximal limb flexors and extensors. The reticulospinal tracts are involved mainly in locomotion and postural control, although they do have other functions as well. The descending reticulospinal tracts are one of four major cortical pathways to the spinal cord for musculoskeletal activity. The reticulospinal tracts works with the other three pathways to give a coordinated control of movement, including delicate manipulations. The four pathways can be grouped into two main system pathways – a medial system and a lateral system. The medial system includes the reticulospinal pathway and the vestibulospinal pathway, and this system provides control of posture. The corticospinal and the rubrospinal tract pathways belong to the lateral system which provides <b>fine</b> <b>control</b> of movement.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the skill}} system is freeform, certain {{combinations}} {{of skills and}} equipment work well together. This combination of specialization in skill and equipment is known as an archetype. The most notable archetypes are street samurai, characters who have heavily augmented their bodies with cyberware and bioware and focus on physical combat; adepts, characters who have magical abilities that increase their physical (and sometimes mental) combat abilities; faces, highly charismatic characters who specialize in negotiations and social manipulation; hackers (deckers), experts in electronic surveillance, security, and augmented/virtual reality monitoring, combat and response; riggers, who augment their brains to achieve <b>fine</b> <b>control</b> over vehicles and drones; and magicians, who cast spells and can view emotions and call spirits from astral space. In Fourth Edition, with the setting change, deckers are replaced by hackers, who manipulate computer networks with augmented reality via ubiquitous commlinks; {{they also tend to}} take over the rigger's role.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} shows that the development of response inhibition and drawing skill are linked. The current research investigated whether this association reflects a more fundamental link between response inhibition and motor control. In Experiment 1, 3 - and 4 -year-olds (n= 100) were tested on measures of inhibition, <b>fine</b> motor <b>control</b> and drawing skill. Data revealed an association between inhibition and <b>fine</b> motor <b>control,</b> which was responsible for most of the association observed with drawing skill. Experiment 2 (n= 100) provided evidence that, unlike <b>fine</b> motor <b>control,</b> gross motor control and inhibition were not associated (after controlling for IQ). Alternative explanations for the link between inhibition and <b>fine</b> motor <b>control</b> are outlined, including a consideration of how these cognitive processes may interact during development...|$|R

25|$|Neutral {{buoyancy}} in a diver is {{an unstable}} state. It is changed by small differences in ambient pressure {{caused by a}} change in depth, and the change has a positive feedback effect. A small descent will increase the pressure, which will compress the gas filled spaces and reduce the total volume of diver and equipment. This will further reduce the buoyancy, and unless counteracted, will result in sinking more rapidly. The equivalent effect applies to a small ascent, which will trigger an increased buoyancy and will result in accelerated ascent unless counteracted. The diver must continuously adjust buoyancy or depth {{in order to remain}} neutral. <b>Fine</b> <b>control</b> of buoyancy can be achieved by controlling the average lung volume in open circuit scuba, but this feature is not available to the closed circuit rebreather diver, as exhaled gas remains in the breathing loop. This is a skill which improves with practice until it becomes second nature.|$|E

25|$|The trampled and de-stemmed {{harvest is}} then pressed. The {{type of wine}} press also affects the {{potential}} quality of the wine. Since the 1980s, pneumatic presses have improved the work involved by working in airtight conditions and allowing a <b>fine</b> <b>control</b> of the pressure to extract the juice without damaging the grapes. The juice or moût de goutte (Must of Drops) is the juice that flows naturally from the berries crushed under their own weight prior to pressing (on {{the way to the}} press). Trampling increases its proportion and makes the material profitable by processing a higher tonnage of grapes in the same time. The moût de presse (Must of the Press) is the juice flowing from the press from the pressure on the grapes. It concentrates the qualities or the defects of the grape: it is rich in aromas, colloids, or phenolic compounds. However, it can also be marked by olfactory defects, such as the smell of fungus on spoiled grapes or the vegetable smell of a harvest with insufficient maturity. The blending or not of the moût de goutte and the moût de presse musts and release depends on the health of the grapes, the method of pressing, and the style of wine intended. Manipulation of the grape before pressing increases the amount of lees and complicates pressing. For the development of a quality wine, their use is excluded or very limited.|$|E
