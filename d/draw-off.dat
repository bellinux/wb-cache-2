2500|$|In the {{adjacent}} diagram, water pumped {{from the tower}} basin is the cooling water routed through the process coolers and condensers in an industrial facility. [...] The cool water absorbs heat from the hot process streams which need to be cooled or condensed, and the absorbed heat warms the circulating water (C). The warm water returns {{to the top of}} the cooling tower and trickles downward over the fill material inside the tower. [...] As it trickles down, it contacts ambient air rising up through the tower either by natural draft or by forced draft using large fans in the tower. That contact causes a small amount of the water to be lost as windage/drift (W) and some of the water (E) to evaporate. The heat required to evaporate the water is derived from the water itself, which cools the water back to the original basin water temperature and the water is then ready to recirculate. The evaporated water leaves its dissolved salts behind in the bulk of the water which has not been evaporated, thus raising the salt concentration in the circulating cooling water. To prevent the salt concentration of the water from becoming too high, a portion of the water is drawn off/blown down (D) for disposal. Fresh water make-up (M) is supplied to the tower basin to compensate for the loss of evaporated water, the windage loss water and the <b>draw-off</b> water.|$|E

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Domestic Hot Water (DHW) {{production}} {{can account for}} a quarter of the energy consumed in UK dwellings and this proportion is likely to increase as the energy required for space heating reduces in order to achieve demand reduction targets. As the margins for improving the performance of heating system technologies diminish, the need for improving modelling accuracy and precision increases. Although studies have considered DHW use, {{there is a lack of}} reflection on the consumption and performance of systems in contemporary UK dwellings. This paper is based on two family homes and investigates heat losses from DHW networks using high resolution demand data combined with an analytical model. The model estimates are compared to widely used building performance models and it is found that the models may over estimate the heat losses by a significant amount and that short <b>draw-offs</b> are particularity influential in determining the amount of heat wasted...|$|R

40|$|A general {{approach}} suitable for handling {{a wide range}} of process scheduling problems and that can be effectively utilized in a framework of a scheduling decision support system is developed. ^ A mixed integer linear programming formulation that handles a variety of complexities, including variable batch sizes, limited availability of resources, intermediate product <b>draw-offs,</b> and a number of objectives is presented along with various techniques to reduce its size and eliminate a large number of the complicating variables and constraints. ^ The characteristics of the difficulty of scheduling instances is investigated via a series of computational experiments. It is found that sharing of equipment and production routes and high set-up costs lead to higher computational times. Large orders, higher processing times, and unstable intermediates lead to smaller CPU times when problems are only slightly constrained and large times for more constrained problems. ^ Initial feasible solutions to the scheduling problem are provided by a new class of heuristic procedures. These heuristics are based on the mathematical programming formulation and exploit the structure of the scheduling problem in order to modify the exact solution procedure to rapidly obtain solutions. The quality of the heuristics is shown to be good, both in terms of computational expense and accuracy. ^ The linear programming relaxations to the mixed integer linear programming formulation are tightened by introducing a number of valid inequalities, which are developed based on the model structure. Computational experiments are shown and the implementation of a separation algorithm that detects violated valid inequalities and amends them to the original formulation is described. New information at each node in the branch-and-bound tree is exploited via an algorithm that predicts which of the valid inequalities will be strong for the inner nodes and amends them to the original formulation. ^ Lastly, an integrated solution approach that combines the findings of this work is presented and its power to solve large practical scheduling problems involving up to 2700 binary variables is demonstrated. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{solution}} of large combinatorial optimization problems {{is becoming increasingly}} important in diverse areas of chemical engineering such as batch process design and scheduling, molecular simulations, and process control. Branch and bound is a well established framework {{that is at the}} core of existing methods for rigorously solving hard combinatorial problems. Though parallel and distributed computers offer great promise in reducing the execution times of branch-and-bound computations, the time and effort needed to parallelize algorithms has prevented their routine use for solving combinatorial problems. A framework that can reduce the burden associated with implementing parallel branch-and-bound algorithms can contribute significantly in enabling the {{solution of}} large problem instances encountered in practice. This thesis is concerned with the development of such a framework. ^ The design goal of DCABB (Distributed Control Architecture for Branch and Bound) is to automate implementation aspects of distributed algorithms without imposing rigid protocol formats that restrict their flexibility. Algorithm customizability is a critical consideration in the design of DCABB since it can have a dramatic impact on the size of practical problems that can be solved. Support is provided for the implementation of a novel parallelization paradigm known as Competing Search Trees. Viability of the framework is demonstrated by implementing two distributed branch-and-bound algorithms using DCABB [...] an algorithm for a multiple resource constrained sequencing problem that can solve instances with up to 75 jobs and three resource constraints and a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solver that has been used to solve problems derived from practical applications including problems from the MIPLIB test suite. A generic branch-and-bound search process has been developed to characterize the performance of distributed algorithms on various network architectures. Experiments using an Ethernet network and a high bandwidth DEC giga-switch network demonstrate the effect of network bandwidth on distributed branch-and-bound computations. Results are presented using up to 32 workstations on a geographically distributed network. To our knowledge this is the largest number of machines used for branch-and-bound in a heterogeneous environment. A heuristic algorithm for scheduling multiproduct plants with deadlines and intermediate feeds and product <b>draw-offs</b> is described in the context of an industrial case study. ...|$|R

Optimisation can be focussed on, for example, payback time and CO 2 emission reduction. Constraints such as maximum initial costs and installation space are taken into account. The applicability of the genetic algorithm was tested for optimisation of large solar hot water systems. Among others, the sensitivity of the optimum system design to the tap water <b>draw-off</b> and the <b>draw-off</b> pattern has been determined using the optimisation algorithm.
