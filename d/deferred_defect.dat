The method is forgeneral purposes {{so that it}} has been tested on different flowsincluding orifice flow. Also it contains a chapter about theexperiment of orifice flow. Higher-order precision interpolation schemes are used inumerical simulation to improve prediction at acceptable gridrefinement. Because higher-order schemes cause instability inconvection-diffusion problems or involve a large computationalkernel, they are implemented with deferred correction method. Alower-order scheme such as upwind numerical scheme is used tomake preliminary guess. A <b>deferred</b> (<b>defect)</b> correction term isadded to maintain precision. This avoids the conflict betweenprecision order and implementation difficulty. The authorproposes a shifting between upwind scheme and centraldifference scheme for the preliminary guess. This has beenproven to improve convergence while higher order schemes havewider range of stability. Non-orthogonal grid is a necessity for complex flow. Usuallyone can map coordinate of such a grid to a transformed domainwhere the grid is regular. The cost is that differentialequations get much more complex form. If calculated directly innon-orthogonal grid, the equations keep simple forms. However,it is difficult to make interpolation in a non-orthogonal grid. Three methods can be used: local correction, shape function andcurvilinear interpolation. The local correction method cannotinsure second-order precision. The shape function method uses alarge computational molecule. The curvilinear interpolationthis author proposes imports the advantage of coordinatetransformation method: easy to do interpolation. A coordinatesystem staggered half control volume used in the coordinatetransformation method is used as accessory to deriveinterpolation schemes. The calculation in physical domain withnon-orthogonal grid becomes as easy as that in a Cartesianorthogonal grid. The author applies this method to calculate turbulentorifice flow. The usual under-prediction of eddy length isimproved with the ULTRA-QUICK scheme to reflect the highgradients in orifice flow. In the last chapter, the author quantifies hydraulicabruptness to describe orifice geometry. The abruptness canhelp engineers to interpolate existing data to a new orifice,which saves detailed experimentsNR 2014080...|$|E
40|$|In {{the recent}} paper by Dutt, Greengard and Rokhlin, {{a variant of}} <b>deferred</b> or <b>defect</b> {{correction}} methods is presented which couples Gaussian quadrature with the Picard integral equation formulation of the initial value ordinary differential equation. The resulting spectral deferred correction methods (SDC) {{have been shown to}} possess favorable accuracy and stability properties even for versions with very high order of accuracy. In this paper, we show that for linear problems, the iterations in the SDC algorithm are equivalent to constructing a preconditioned Neumann series expansion for the solution of the standard collocation discretization of the ODE. This observation is used to accelerate the convergence of SDC using the GMRES Krylov subspace method. For nonlinear problems, the GMRES acceleration is coupled with a linear implicit approach. Stability and accuracy analyses show the accelerated scheme provides an improvement in the accuracy, efficiency, and stability of the original SDC approach. Furthermore, preliminary numerical experiments show that accelerating the convergence of SDC methods can effectively eliminate the order reduction previously observed for stiff ODE systems.
