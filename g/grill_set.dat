50|$|First, {{the desired}} {{temperature}} is programmed into the electronic control panel. A motor-driven auger then feeds {{a small amount}} of pellets from the hopper to the fire pot. Igniter rods light the pellets and prime the fire, raising the grill to an initial starting temperature (140 °F to 180 °F, depending on manufacturer). Once the fire is ready, the desired temperature is achieved via a repeated duty cycle, which represents a segment of time when the auger is active and idle. A single duty cycle starts when the auger turns on and begins feeding pellets then continues through the period when it shuts off and remains idle. The duty cycle ends when the auger turns on again. For example, a pellet <b>grill</b> <b>set</b> to 250 °F might have an auger-on period of 10 seconds followed by an auger-off period of 50 seconds. Duty cycles are typically stated as a percentage that represents the amount of time the auger is running—an auger that's always on has a 100% duty cycle, while one that is on half the time has a 50% duty cycle. Each temperature setting has a different duty cycle. However, regardless of that temperature setting, the auger-on portion of the duty cycle remains constant. The auger-off period is the variable. Lower temperatures have longer auger-off periods, while high temperatures have shorter.|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} the temperature variation {{of an electric}} belt <b>grill</b> <b>set</b> at four temperatures, a forced-air convection oven set at three temperatures, and an electric broiler that has no temperature control. After finding that the actual temperatures of the electric belt grill and the forced-air convection oven were higher than the targeted temperature, we used regression techniques to correct for the temperature biases of both cooking methods. The forced-air convection oven was very precise when the doors were kept closed, as was the electric belt grill after adjustments were made. Temperature of the electric broiler was not consistent across surface positions or among replications. We suggest that when used for cooking experiments, each meat-cooking instrument be validated for temperature and corrected when necessary. This will improve cooking consistency and related results among various instruments and research institutions...|$|E
40|$|Team License to <b>Grill</b> <b>set</b> out {{to asses}} Bull Outdoor Products, Inc. ’s barbeques and {{quantify}} the apparent uneven temperature distribution or “hot spots” and “cold spots” across the grill. This testing was accomplished {{with the design}} and fabrication of a test fixture allowing for accurate and repeatable temperature collection across the barbeque. With results that matched the sponsor’s claims of hot and cold spots, an engineering model was made using heat transfer and thermodynamic equations. Once the model somewhat resembled the experimental data, {{it was used to}} suggest different modifications that would allow for better temperature distribution. It was discovered that the flame tamers have a large role in controlling heat going to the grill bars. This led to testing modified flame tamers to control temperature differences across the barbeque. It was found that greater air flow through the top of the flame tamers resulted in a more uniform temperature of the grill. The final iteration of the modified flame tamers incorporated larger holes that allowed for more hot gas to heat the front of the grill giving a slightly better front-to-back temperature distribution than before...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to characterize the impact of grilling temperature on ribeye, top loin and top sirloin steaks. Boneless ribeye rolls, top loin and top sirloin butt subprimals (n = 16 each, 48 total) were purchased from a local meat supplier. After aging 21 d post-processing, 2. 54 -cm-thick steaks were hand cut and randomly assigned a grilling temperature treatment (177 ?C, 205 ?C, or 232 ?C), vacuum-packaged, and frozen at - 10 ?C until testing. Steaks were grilled to an internal temperature of 71 ?C on a commercial flat top <b>grill</b> <b>set</b> at 177 ? C, 205 ? C, or 232 ? C. Consumers (n = 80) were served nine samples and prompted to rate their liking of overall, tenderness, juiciness, appearance, and flavor on a 9 -point hedonic scale. Steaks cooked for Warner-Bratzler shear force were held over night at 4 ? C before removing six cores 1. 3 cm in diameter from each steak. Steaks were also cooked and served to a sensory panel trained on flavor and texture attributes. Samples from the steaks used for trained sensory panel analysis were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80 ? C for GC/MS ? olfactory analysis. Results were analyzed as a 3 x 3 factorial completely randomized design. No differences (P > 0. 05) in consumer overall, tenderness, juiciness, appearance, and flavor liking were detected between steak type or grill temperature. The center color of ribeye steaks was lighter (P 0. 05) on trained panel tenderness scores. Of the volatiles present during an aroma event (n = 67), pyrazine compounds were most influenced by grill surface temperature. The tenderness and juiciness of steaks grilled at differing temperatures were not perceived to be different by consumers; however, grilling temperature impacted the flavor of the final product by generating more pyrazine compounds...|$|E

40|$|Two {{types of}} {{eggplants}} (Solanum melongena L.), Chinese Eggplant and Indian Eggplant were cooked at three different cooking methods including frying, grilling and superheated steam (SHS). The {{objective of this}} research was to discover the effect of different cooking methods on the quality attributes of eggplant in terms of the physico-chemical properties, antioxidant properties and overall acceptability. The conditions for frying and <b>grilling</b> were <b>set</b> at 170 °C for 7 minutes meanwhile; two parameters were used in SHS including 170 °C for 7 minutes and 220 °C at 15 minutes as the optimum conditions. SHS gives highest results in terms of physicochemical properties and antioxidant properties but frying methods gain high scores for the overall acceptability. Based on the results it can be concluded that even though SHS gives healthier and better results of the eggplant, but, texture, taste and aroma will influence on the acceptability of the final food products...|$|R
500|$|Grill {{followed}} his uncle Claes' advice {{and went to}} Canton as third supercargo on the Fredric Adolph in 1761, during the second carter of the SOIC. On 3September 1761, the ship ran aground at the Pratas Islands in the South China Sea. The ship's captain, Daniel Shierman, did what he could to lighten the ship {{and tried to get}} it afloat again, but to no avail. Seven hours later the ship was a wreck, resting on the rocks and everyone aboard went into the boats. Twenty men stayed behind to guard the ship, while 122 men, including <b>Grill,</b> immediately <b>set</b> off for the nearest port. Five days later they landed on the Chinese mainland, in the [...] "province of Catsi" [...] , where they eventually got permission from the Chinese authorities to proceed to Canton. In Canton they met with the men left to guard the ship, now 17 in number, who had arrived two weeks earlier. Three expeditions with divers, one of them led by Grill, went to recover the cargo from the wreck. They managed to salvage about two-thirds of the silver, tin, iron, coral, lead and copper from the cargo, plus one cat and a dog.|$|R
5000|$|Martin Filler, in an {{overview}} of Graves' work as of 1980, wrote that [...] "The Synderman House is a central work in Michael Graves' career. It is his largest completed building to date, but its significance comes not from its size. It is transitional work, and transitional works in architecture are much rarer than in other art forms, {{a result of the}} architectural artifact taking so long to produce. The Snyderman House, designed in 1972 and completed five years later, spans Michael Graves' two stylistic phases. The house is composed of a white, cage-like exterior frame, typical of his first projects. But within that Cubist <b>grill</b> are <b>set</b> massive volumes--sheer gray wall planes, an undulating terra cotta facade--and relatively small expanses of glass, all of which are more characteristic of his current projects. This is an early Michael Graves building with a later Michael Graves building trapped inside it, fighting to emerge. Its debt both in form and color to the earlier work of John Hejduk, and its impact on later work by other architects (such as Richard Meier's Atheneum of 1975-70 in New Harmony, Ind.) confirm it as an important work of the 1970's." ...|$|R
50|$|The family meets Chase, an {{insurance}} adjuster who at first {{seemed like he}} believes the story Bob and Tina invented {{in order to get}} their insurance claim. He invites the family to cater a party at his house, where Tina (who was manning the <b>grill)</b> accidentally <b>sets</b> the house on fire. Tina gets nightmares from the lies and Bob finally decides to come clean to Chase {{and the rest of the}} family. When they arrive at his office however, Chase reveals that he knew the story was just invented, but he figured that if he helped the Belchers get their insurance claim, they could help him earn money by committing insurance fraud. He then admits that the fire was no accident: he used unscented gas to burn down the house. After refusing to go along with his crimes, Chase blackmails the two of them and he tells Tina that Bob could go to jail. He then says that they should flood their basement in order to file another insurance claim. The family then tries to trick Chase by making it look like the children drowned in the basement so he would leave them alone, but he sees through their lies and tells them that he wasn't letting go of them, since restaurants are magnets for accidents.|$|R
50|$|Early Traeger Grills, {{as well as}} many of the pellet grills first {{introduced}} after the expiration of the Traeger patent, used a simple three-position controller, sometimes called a LMH controller. As the name suggests, the control panel utilizes a knob with three settings, Low (or Smoke), Medium, and High, intended for smoking, baking, and <b>grilling,</b> respectively. Each <b>setting</b> approximates a temperature range, and those temperatures were achieved by means of a fixed, predetermined duty cycle*. For instance, on Medium the pellet grill reaches 300-325 °F by repeating a duty cycle in which the auger feeds pellets for two minutes then goes idle for two minutes. So long as the controller remains on that <b>setting,</b> the pellet <b>grill</b> continuously performs the same duty cycle. Although this type of controller can automatically reach and maintain a predetermined cooking range—give or take 25-50 °F—it has obvious shortcomings. Offering only three temperature settings, with large jumps in temperature between each, limits cooking options and prevents the user from cooking with precision. Furthermore, because the duty cycles are fixed, they don't account for weather conditions or the amount of food being cooked, both of which affect temperature. Thus, on a cold, windy day, a pellet grill with a three-position controller that is filled with meat will struggle to reach its set temperature. The duty cycles themselves are also problematic. The auger-on portion of the cycle is too long, allowing large amounts of pellets to pile up in the fire pot and ignite at once, causing sudden, sharp temperature swings.|$|R
