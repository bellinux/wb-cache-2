5|$|The Mk 41 Stable Vertical (also called Gun Director) was a {{vertical}} seeking gyroscope. Its function {{was to establish}} and maintain a stable <b>earth</b> <b>vertical</b> with its associated horizontal plane. With the horizontal plane established, the Mk 41 continuously measured the angles between the deck and the horizontal plane. These deck angles were continuously transmitted to the Rangekeeper so that it could keep the guns correctly elevated as the ship rolled and pitched. Mounted waist high on its side were the battery's firing keys. (see picture) The left key was the Salvo Signal Key, and it sounded the Salvo Buzzer in each of the turrets to warn the gun crews that the guns were about to fire. The center key (with bumps on its handle for tactile identification) was the Automatic Firing Key. When this key was held closed, the Mk 41 was enabled to automatically fire the guns whenever the ship's deck was parallel the horizontal plane. Also, if the sea state was such that the turrets' elevation power drives could not keep up with the ship's motion, the guns could be held at a fixed elevation, and the MK 41 could again automatically fire the guns as described. The right key was the Hand Firing Key. It bypassed the Mk 41, and fired the guns directly.|$|E

Static tilt (from 0 to 57 deg. to either side) showed a 10 % decrease in otolith induced ocular torsion after centrifugation. This implies a reduced gain of the otolith function. The dynamic condition consisted of sinusoidal body roll (frequency 0. 25 Hz, amplitude 45 deg.) about an earth horizontal and about an <b>earth</b> <b>vertical</b> axis (respectively, "with" and "without" otolith stimulation). Before centrifugation the gain of the slow component velocity (SCV) was significantly lower "with" otolith stimulation than "without" otolith stimulation.

Therefore, the observed increase in SCV gain in the condition "with" otolith stimulation after centrifugation, seems in correspondence with the decreased otolith gain in the static condition...|$|E

To this end, twenty-four subjects were passively disoriented by an abrupt stop after an increase in yaw velocity, about an <b>Earth</b> <b>vertical</b> axis, up to 120 °/s. Immediately thereafter, they had to actively maintain a stationary position despite a disturbance signal. Subjects wore a tactile display vest with 48 miniature vibrators, applied in different combinations with visual and vestibular stimuli. Their performance was quantified by RMS body velocity during self-control. Fast eye movement phases were analyzed by counting samples exceeding a velocity limit, slow phases by a novel method applying a first order model. Without tactile and visual information, subjects returned to a previous level of angular motion. Tactile stimulation decreased RMS self velocity considerably, though less than vision. No differences were observed between conditions in which the vest was active during the recovery phase only or during the disorienting phase as well. All effects of tactile stimulation found on the eye movement parameters could be explained by the vestibular stimulus. © 2005 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|International audienceInternal models serve sensory processing, {{sensorimotor}} {{integration and}} motor control. They {{could be a}} way to construct and update a sense of verticality, by combining vestibular and somatosensory graviception. We tested this hypothesis by investigating self-orientation relative to gravity in 39 normal subjects and in subjects with various somatosensory losses showing either a complete deafferentation of trunk and lower limbs (14 paraplegic patients after complete traumatic spinal cord injury) or a gradient in the degree of a hemibody sensory loss (23 hemiplegic patients after stroke). We asked subjects to estimate, in the dark, the direction of the <b>Earth</b> <b>vertical</b> in two postural conditions-upright and at lateral whole body tilt. For upright conditions, verticality estimates were not different {{from the direction of the}} <b>Earth</b> <b>vertical</b> in normal (0. 24 ° ± 1; P = 0. 42) and paraplegic subjects (0. 87 ° ± 0. 9; P = 0. 14). The within-subject variability was much greater in hemiplegic than in normal subjects (2. 05 ° ± 1. 15 versus 1. 06 ° ± 0. 4; P < 0. 01) and greater in paraplegic than in normal subjects (1. 13 ° ± 0. 4 versus 0. 72 ° ± 0. 4; P < 0. 01). These findings indicate that, even if vestibular graviception is intact, somaesthetic graviception contributes to the sense of verticality, leading to a more robust judgement about the direction of verticality when vestibular and somaesthetic graviception yield congruent information. As expected, when normal subjects were tilted, their verticality estimates were biased in the direction of the body tilt (5. 55 ° ± 3. 9). This normal modulation of verticality perception (Aubert effect), was preserved in hemiplegics on the side of the normoaesthetic hemibody (ipsilesional) (6. 09 ° ± 6. 3), and abolished both in paraplegics (1. 06 ° ± 2. 5) and in hemiplegics (0. 04 ° ± 6. 7) on the side of hypoaesthetic hemibody (contralesional). This incongruence did not exist in deafferented paraplegics who exclusively used vestibular graviception with a similar efficacy no matter what the lateral body position. The Aubert effect was not an on-off phenomenon since the degree of hemiplegics' somatosensory loss correlated with the modulation of verticality perception when they were tilted to the side of hypoaesthetic hemibody (r = - 0. 55; P < 0. 01). The analysis of anatomical correlates showed that the Aubert effect required the integrity of the posterolateral thalamus. This study reveals the existence of a synthesis of vestibular and somaesthetic graviception for which the posterolateral thalamus plays a major role. This corresponds to a primary property of internal models and yields the neural bases of the Aubert effect. We conclude that humans construct and update internal models of verticality in which somatosensory information plays an important role...|$|E
