25|$|They {{first began}} teaming {{together}} in June 2009 {{but did not}} become a proper team {{until the end of}} the year. The two were portrayed as narcissistic and vain bullies, constantly espousing their own perfection while <b>ganging</b> up on others and attacking their looks. They were a successful team, having won both women's titles available in WWE, the WWE Women's Championship, which they retired when they unified it with the WWE Divas Championship; both titles they claimed to hold as a tag team though this is not officially recognized. The group did court some controversy, however, receiving criticism from the Wrestling Observer Newsletter for what it considered the most disgusting promotional tactic regarding a storyline in which they bullied Mickie James for her supposed weight issues.|$|E
25|$|The group {{moved over}} to the north end (La Salle side) after talks between Cojuangco and Letran Rector Fr. Regino Cortes. Only then did the Letran bleachers fill up. With the game on the way, Letran was toting a 22–18 lead when they called a {{time-out}} halfway through the first half; then, the south end reserve section (Letran side) erupted with at least five burly men (part of the guests of La Salle's team manager) <b>ganging</b> up on a hapless Letran high school sophomore student for a full minute before police could intervene. But for the mauled student, none was picked up (by the police). Almost simultaneously, the La Salle bench suddenly stood up, the players hunched and protecting their heads with towels and jackets against various missiles pelted on them.|$|E

500|$|The {{technique}} and clothing of Roman charioteers differed significantly from {{those used by}} the Greeks. Roman drivers wrapped the reins round their waist, while the Greeks held the reins in their hands. Because of this, the Romans could not {{let go of the}} reins in a crash, so they would be dragged around the circus until they were killed or they freed themselves. In order to cut the reins and keep from being dragged in case of accident, they carried a falx, a curved knife. They also wore helmets and other protective gear. In any given race, there might be a number of teams put up by each faction, who would cooperate to maximize their chances of victory by <b>ganging</b> up on opponents, forcing them out of the preferred inside track or making them lose concentration and [...] expose themselves to accident and injury. Spectators could also play a part as there is evidence they threw lead [...] "curse" [...] amulets studded with nails at teams opposing their favourite.|$|E
2500|$|The dual of a RC Cauer {{network is}} a LR Cauer network which is {{required}} for the Z' impedance as shown in the example. [...] Adjustment is a bit problematic with this equaliser. [...] In order to maintain the constant resistance, the pairs of components C1/L1', C2/L2' etc., must remain dual impedances as the component is adjusted, so both parts of the pair must be adjusted together. [...] With the Zobel Bode equaliser, this is a simple matter of <b>ganging</b> two pots together - a component configuration available off-the-shelf. [...] <b>Ganging</b> together a variable capacitor and inductor is not, however, a very practical solution.

[...] The furthest element of the ladder from the driving point is equalising the lowest frequency of interest. [...] This is adjusted first as it will also have an effect on higher frequencies and from there progressively higher frequencies are adjusted working along the ladder towards the driving point.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 Criminologists {{disagree}} {{on the level of}} organization present in street <b>gangs.</b> On one end of the spectrum, <b>gangs</b> are thought to be highly organized groups with formal rules and regulations. Conversely, some scholars argue that <b>gangs</b> are groups of loosely affiliated individuals. The present research will revisit this debate by looking at how <b>gang</b> organization, as perceived by individual <b>gang</b> members, affects the length of time an individual spends in a <b>gang.</b> This research also investigates how one’s identity as a <b>gang</b> member affects desistance from the <b>gang.</b> As a competing explanation, we examine the role of self-control theory in relation to desistance from <b>gang</b> membership. We use discrete-time event history models to evaluate whether perceived <b>gang</b> organization and an individual’s identity as a <b>gang</b> member impact desistance from street <b>gangs.</b> Results indicate that increased perceived <b>gang</b> organization is independently associated with longer length of time in the <b>gang.</b> Furthermore, the effect of one’s social identity on the length of time in the <b>gang</b> is mediated by whether the individual has peers outside the <b>gang</b> and how much time they spend with their <b>gang</b> peers...|$|R
50|$|As in New York and northeastern <b>gangs,</b> it {{was during}} the early period of Chicago <b>gang</b> growth that <b>gangs</b> {{connected}} themselves politically to local leaders. Such <b>gangs</b> as Ragen's Colts became influential in Chicago politics. By the 1920s, several <b>gangs</b> had grown to the point of becoming organized crime groups in Chicago (e.g. the Chicago Outfit under Al Capone), and <b>gang</b> warfare was common among them. Street <b>gang</b> activity continued alongside these larger criminal organizations; contemporary estimates suggested some 25,000 <b>gang</b> members and 1,300 <b>gangs</b> in Chicago during the late 1920s. By the early 1930s, however, these immigrant-dominated <b>gangs</b> largely died out.|$|R
5000|$|Female <b>gang</b> {{members can}} {{function}} {{in one of}} three capacities, as theorized and defined by Walter Miller: independently functioning units, coed <b>gangs,</b> and female auxiliaries to male <b>gangs.</b> [...] Independently functioning units are all-female <b>gangs</b> that operate under their own <b>gang</b> colors and name, without oversight from existing male <b>gangs.</b> Coed <b>gangs</b> possess both male and female members. Most leadership positions are held by males, although Taylor notes that positions and power held by female members varies from <b>gang</b> to <b>gang,</b> and are often dependent on the <b>gang’s</b> structure, most notably whether or not it operates for profit. [...] Female auxiliary <b>gangs</b> adopt the symbols of and modify the name of an existing male <b>gang,</b> but operate semi-autonomously. They act {{in the interests of the}} male <b>gang,</b> but control member initiation and internal affairs of the group.|$|R
