5|$|When Mansfield {{returned}} to Hollywood in mid-1960, 20th Century-Fox cast her in <b>It</b> <b>Happened</b> in Athens (1962). She received first billing above the title, but only {{appeared in a}} supporting role. <b>It</b> <b>Happened</b> in Athens starred Trax Colton, a handsome newcomer and an unknown whom Fox was trying to mold into a heartthrob. This Olympic Games-based film was shot in Greece in fall 1960, but was unreleased until June 1962. It was a box office failure, and Mansfield's 20th Century-Fox contract was dropped.|$|E
5|$|Gordon Lindsay's eulogy {{stated that}} Branham's death was {{the will of}} God and privately, he {{accepted}} the interpretation of Kenneth Hagin, {{who claimed to have}} prophesied Branham's death two years before <b>it</b> <b>happened.</b> According to Hagin, God revealed that Branham was teaching false doctrine and God was removing Branham because of his disobedience.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, metal {{detectors}} {{were added to}} the gates and security was doubled after a person was killed in a shooting during a crowded Mother's Day. <b>It</b> <b>happened</b> after two visitors were involved in a fight, apparently over a drug exchange before their visit to the park.|$|E
5|$|Although Hasekura's embassy was cordially {{received}} in Spain and Rome, <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> {{at a time}} when Japan was moving toward the suppression of Christianity. European monarchs such as the King of Spain thus refused the trade agreements Hasekura had been seeking. Hasekura returned to Japan in 1620 and died of illness a year later, his embassy seemingly ending with few results in an increasingly isolationist Japan.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there were}} {{differences}} in season one, the current rules have applied in all subsequent seasons. One feature continued from season one {{was the way the}} show opened: viewers were shown the biggest and most intense physical altercation of the season, and the program then went back to a time before <b>it</b> <b>happened.</b> This fight usually gives you an idea of {{who is going to be}} the baddest, or one of the baddest, girls in the house. This altercation draws in many viewers and keeps them wondering what will happen next.|$|E

40|$|This novel {{takes us}} down the rabbit hole of a past we know and a future we are now {{uncertain}} of. Slavery, segregation, the civil rights movement; we act as though these events are in our country’s distant past, that we would never allow such an atrocity to happen again. Because we think we’ve learned from our mistakes. Yet a man who referred to a black man as his African American now holds the highest office in the land. So when <b>it</b> <b>happens,</b> if <b>it</b> <b>happens,</b> when <b>it</b> <b>happens,</b> this is how <b>it</b> <b>happens.</b> ...|$|R
5|$|As {{with the}} {{automated}} mill, Evans's ideas were harshly criticized by other engineers—most notably {{some of the}} Philadelphia engineering community including the influential Benjamin Latrobe. As <b>it</b> <b>happened,</b> Cornish engineer Richard Trevithick had simultaneously developed similar ideas in favor of high-pressure engines and begun to experiment with them in developing the first locomotives, but neither knew of the other's work.|$|E
5|$|Bakshi had {{selected}} {{a number of}} songs from his own record collection for the film's soundtrack, which were not used in the film due to {{the high costs of}} licensing the songs. The film was initially scored by singer Dan Hicks, who became involved with the production of the film in 1974. Because of the delay of the film's release, Hicks' label released the material from these sessions under the title <b>It</b> <b>Happened</b> One Bite. When the film was released in 1982, it had been rescored by John Madara.|$|E
5|$|Had Eisenhower {{postponed}} the invasion, {{the next}} available period {{with the right}} combination of tides (but without the desirable full moon) was two weeks later, from 18 to 20 June.

5|$|In 1009 Symeon {{was sent}} into exile near Paloukiton, {{a small village}} near Chrysopolis on the Asiatic shore of the Bosphorus. According to one account, he was left by church {{authorities}} alone and without food, {{in the middle of}} winter. There he found a deserted and ruined chapel that had been dedicated to Saint Macrina. <b>It</b> <b>happened</b> to be on land owned by one of Symeon's spiritual children, Christopher Phagouras, who donated the land and proceeds to start a monastery.|$|E
5|$|Moore {{became known}} for his {{involvement}} in the variety of stunts and demonstrations of the show's contestants.

5|$|Part of {{the appeal}} was the cars, I'm {{a bit of a}} buff... And I said– jokingly, of course– that I wouldn't be in The 39 Steps unless the action {{included}} the famous chase scene in which Hannay is pursued by a biplane. I've always wanted to be chased by a plane like Cary Grant in the movie North by Northwest and I was just delighted when <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> in our version of Steps.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{contrast}} to his largely comedy-based acting career, Koechner starred in the 2016 drama Priceless, a film about human trafficking. He said of the role, [...] "My wife and I have five kids — {{three of them are}} daughters. So, just to imagine the horror of any young lady having to go through this. This film is based on true events. <b>It’s</b> <b>happening</b> right now. <b>It’s</b> <b>happening</b> in Chicago. <b>It’s</b> <b>happening</b> here in Los Angeles. <b>It’s</b> <b>happening</b> globally.

50|$|Although {{it is not}} {{impossible}} for a side following-on to win a game, <b>it</b> <b>happens</b> rarely.

5|$|The ANC {{threatened}} to withdraw support for South Africa's next test match against Australia, {{which could have}} led to the cancellation the match due to safety concerns and Australia stated they would not play if the match didn't have ANC support. However, the future South African sports minister Steve Tshwete asked for the ANC to give the supporters another chance and the ANC did not withdraw their support. Instead they issued a warning that if <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> again they would oppose all future tours and the 1995 Rugby World Cup.|$|E
5|$|The Great Plague, lasting from 1665 to 1666, was {{the last}} major {{epidemic}} of the bubonic plague to occur in England. <b>It</b> <b>happened</b> within the centuries-long time period of the Second Pandemic, {{an extended period of}} intermittent bubonic plague epidemics which began in Europe in 1347, {{the first year of the}} Black Death, an outbreak which included other forms such as pneumonic plague, and lasted until 1750.|$|E
5|$|The Przeworsk culture, {{named after}} a town in Lesser Poland, near which another burial ground was found, {{originated}} like the Oksywie culture around 250 BC, but lasted a long time. In its course it went through many changes, formed tribal and political structures, fought wars, also with the Romans, until in the 5th century AD its highly developed society of farmers, artisans, warriors and chiefs left for the temptations of the fallen empire lands (for many of them <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> possibly rather quickly, {{during the first half}} of that century).|$|E

One reason why <b>it</b> <b>happens</b> is that people make decisions too quickly. What do I mean? The more serious the crime, the more pressure there is to solve it. Because there is tremendous pressure on police officials to solve notorious crimes, the investigation process suffers and innocent persons may be convicted...|$|R

5|$|The {{other three}} songs on Desolate North one was {{recorded}} {{at the same}} place in early 2005, and the other two, the harp pieces, were recorded at Anderson's home.
