5|$|Gould never embraced cladistics as {{a method}} of {{investigating}} evolutionary lineages and process, possibly because he was concerned that such investigations would lead to neglect of the details in historical biology, which he considered all-important. In the early 1990s this led him into a debate with Derek Briggs, who had begun to apply quantitative cladistic techniques to the Burgess Shale fossils, about the methods to be used <b>in</b> <b>interpreting</b> these fossils. Around this time cladistics rapidly became the dominant method of classification in evolutionary biology. Inexpensive but increasingly powerful personal computers made it possible to process large quantities of data about organisms and their characteristics. Around the same time the development of effective polymerase chain reaction techniques made it possible to apply cladistic methods of analysis to biochemical and genetic features as well.|$|E
5|$|Most useful ATP analogs {{cannot be}} hydrolyzed as ATP would be; instead they trap the enzyme in a {{structure}} {{closely related to}} the ATP-bound state. Adenosine 5′-(γ-thiotriphosphate) is an extremely common ATP analog in which one of the gamma-phosphate oxygens is replaced by a sulfur atom; this anion is hydrolyzed at a dramatically slower rate than ATP itself and functions as an inhibitor of ATP-dependent processes. In crystallographic studies, hydrolysis transition states are modeled by the bound vanadate ion. However, caution is warranted <b>in</b> <b>interpreting</b> the results of experiments using ATP analogs, since some enzymes can hydrolyze them at appreciable rates at high concentration.|$|E

5|$|The {{capabilities}} and reactionary {{nature of the}} judges have been criticized. The main complaint reportedly made by Saudis privately is that judges, who have wide discretion <b>in</b> <b>interpreting</b> the Sharia, have no knowledge, and are often contemptuous, of the modern world. Reported examples of judges' attitudes include rulings banning {{such things as the}} children’s game Pokémon, telephones that play recorded music, and sending flowers to hospital patients. Saudi judges come from a narrow recruitment pool. By one estimate, 80% of the 600+ Saudi judges and almost all senior judges come from Qasim, a province {{in the center of the}} country with less than 5% of Saudi's population, but known as the strict religious Wahhabi heartland of Saudi Arabia. Senior judges will only allow like-minded graduates of select religious institutes to join the judiciary and will remove judges that stray away from rigidly conservative judgments.|$|E
5|$|The {{three species}} {{described}} by Peck were distinguished {{on the basis}} of physical features that were later found to be somewhat overlapping. In terms of microscopic characters, spore sizes were not sufficiently different between them to be used as discriminating taxonomic characters. Subsequent investigators of North American mushroom flora had difficulties <b>in</b> <b>interpreting</b> Peck's concepts of these three taxa and in confirming their presence in their regional investigations. For example, McIlvaine (1902), Hard (1908), and McDougall (1925) reported (as variety or species) only C.ebulbosus. Bisby (1938), Christensen (1946), Smith (1958), and Groves (1962) mentioned only C.quadrifidus. Both Kauffman (1918) and Graham (1944) described C.ebulbosus and C.quadrifidus; Graham, however, only included C.quadrifidus in his key to his descriptions of Coprinus species. In 1979, W.Patrick published a comparative analysis of the three taxa from material collected by Peck, and, after concluding that the three were not sufficiently distinct to be considered separate species, reduced them to synonymy with Coprinopsis variegata, the earliest name.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} stages of the British raj, the 1946 Cabinet Mission to India {{proposed}} a Constituent Assembly to draft a Constitution for India as {{part of the process of}} transfer of power. The Constituent Assembly of India, composed of indirectly elected representatives from the British provinces and Princely states, commenced its proceedings in December 1946, and completed drafting the Constitution of India by November 1949. According to the Cabinet Mission plan, the Assembly was to have an Advisory Committee to advise it on the nature and extent of fundamental rights, protection of minorities and administration of tribal areas. Accordingly, the Advisory Committee was constituted in January 1947 with 64 members, and from among these a twelve-member sub-committee on Fundamental Rights was appointed under the chairmanship of J.B. Kripalani in February 1947. The sub-committee drafted the Fundamental Rights and submitted its report to the Committee by April 1947, and later that month the Committee placed it before the Assembly, which debated and discussed the rights over the course of the following year, adopting the drafts of most of them by, December 1948. The drafting of the Fundamental Rights was influenced by the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the U.N. General Assembly and the activities of the United Nations Human Rights Commission, as well as decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court <b>in</b> <b>interpreting</b> the Bill of Rights in the American Constitution. The Directive Principles, which were also drafted by the sub-committee on Fundamental Rights, expounded the socialist precepts of the Indian independence movement, and were inspired by similar principles contained in the Irish Constitution. The Fundamental Duties were later added to the Constitution by the 42nd Amendment in 1976.|$|E

In informal research <b>in</b> two <b>interpreting</b> classes it was found out that for majority of the students note-taking was helpful. However, <b>in</b> consecutive <b>interpreting</b> practice some students found that it was distracting and made the interpreting task even more difficult because they had to do two tasks at the same time, i. e. listening to the speech to be interpreted and thinking about what to write. In addition, they also claimed that they had difficulties in using their notes for accomplishing the interpreting task. More practices were then given on how to take notes during the interpreting task. The factor which students claimed to be intimidating was also eliminated.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} a {{growing interest in}} multimodal features of spoken language (Müller et al. 2013), that crucially involve the interaction of the auditory (speech), visual gaze) and kinesthetic (gesture, posture) modalities in construing and communicating meaning. Especially eye-gaze patterns in (semi-) naturalistic settings are receiving increasing attention in multimodal interaction research. The present study pursues this recent line of research by inquiring into the role of eye-gaze in correlation with other (non-) verbal signals in the specific institutionalized setting of interpreter-mediated dialogue. Studies have shown that synchronization and turn transfer <b>in</b> <b>interpreted</b> dialogues are collaboratively coordinated through verbal and non-verbal means (Wadensjö 1998, Bot 2005, Mason 2012). Especially gaze direction has an important function in signaling conversational attention and facilitating turn taking <b>in</b> <b>interpreted</b> dialogues (Lang 1978, Wadensjö 2001, Bot 2005, Mason 2012). In this study we aim at an in-depth analysis of the gaze patterns of the participants <b>in</b> <b>interpreted</b> dialogues <b>in</b> relation to speech, gesture and posture and how they function in the constitution of dialogue management. We collected a corpus of semi-authentic interpreter-mediated interactions by using mobile eye-tracking technology (Gullberg & Kita 2009, Jokinen 2010, Brône & Oben 2013, Oben & Brône fc.). The data annotation and statistical processing of the gaze data was largely based on the workflow developed in Brône et al. (2013) for face-to-face dialogues. The analysis of gaze patterns is indicative of interpreter’s regulatory role in this type of dialogue. Moreover, the study provides insights in the processes of turn-taking, footing (e. g. speaker selection) information management and grounding (or the process of establishing common ground) <b>in</b> <b>interpreted</b> interaction. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{study of}} {{interpreting}} (oral translation) and power. The thesis is based on fieldwork with participant observation from <b>interpreted</b> encounters <b>in</b> Oslo where the Norwegian state meets immigrants and foreigners. The official interpreter role prescription in Norway is strict and limited, yet, <b>in</b> observations of <b>interpreted</b> encounters, an ambiguous and complex interpreter role is apparent. There is substantial flexibility in the interpreter role prescription and role performance. The <b>interpreted</b> encounters discussed <b>in</b> the thesis are between individuals (who are not proficient in Norwegian) and the Norwegian state. In these encounters, the individuals are those who will suffer the gravest and most immediate consequences if the communication breaks down {{in one way or}} another. Therefore, those setting standards and developing structures for the provision of interpreting services exercise substantial power over individuals who are not proficient in Norwegian, their lives and their futures. There are multiple layers of power <b>in</b> <b>interpreted</b> encounters. The critical position of the interpreter in communication gives this person a great deal of power over the interaction that takes place. Interpreter users, and especially the public interpreter users, have substantial power <b>in</b> <b>interpreted</b> encounters. And finally, the structural power inherent in the cultural presumptions in the state’s public administration and administration of justice is integral in the power relations <b>in</b> <b>interpreted</b> encounters...|$|R
