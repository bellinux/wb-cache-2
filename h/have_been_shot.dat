Only 14 can {{be judged}} {{with a degree}} of certainty to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> down by USAAF fighters, and possibly two more. Four are confirmed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> down by AAA fire. Total JG 11 losses were 28. The air battle over Asch had lasted 45 minutes.|$|E
5|$|In September 2012 the Israeli {{government}} set {{up another}} inquiry {{at the request}} of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The team was led by Yossi Kuperwasser, director-general of the Strategic Affairs Ministry. In May 2013 it published a 44-page report concluding that the al-Durrahs had not been hit by IDF fire and may not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> at all.|$|E
5|$|The {{boys were}} found in their beds in their own room (formerly Sheila's room). They {{appeared}} to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> while in bed.

5|$|Aleksandras Stulginskis and Petras Klimas {{were sent}} to prison in Siberia by Soviet authorities, but survived and {{returned}} to Lithuania; Pranas Dovydaitis and Vladas Mironas were also sent to Siberia but died there. Kazys Bizauskas disappeared {{during the summer of}} 1941 while being transported to a Soviet prison in Minsk; he is presumed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> along with a number of other prisoners. Donatas Malinauskas was deported to Russia on June 14, 1941.|$|E
5|$|Altogether JG 1 lost 25 {{pilots and}} 29 {{aircraft}}. This return for around 60 enemy aircraft (54 on the ground) cannot {{be considered a}} complete success, although the damage at St. Denijs Westrem and Maldegem had been significant. Just nine of the fighters lost by JG 1 are confirmed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> down in combat with Spitfires. It is possible a further three were shot down by Spitfires, or perhaps ground fire. Two Spitfires were shot down and destroyed, with two more damaged. One pilot of each Squadron (308 and 317) was killed. The total Spitfire losses were perhaps 32.|$|E

50|$|On 25 August 1987, da Silva <b>was</b> <b>shot</b> {{seven times}} by three policemen who claim he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{resisting}} arrest. However, relatively {{few people in}} Brazil believed the official report.

50|$|Marathi film 'Gajaar' {{has become}} the first film {{in the history of}} Marathi Cinema to <b>be</b> <b>shot</b> entirely using a digital camera. The film, which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> live on the annual pilgrimage of Saint Dnyaneshwar from Alandi in Pune to Pandharpur in Solapur, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> on a Canon 7D, a digital SLR camera.|$|R
5|$|An {{intelligence}} official told Seymour Hersh in 2015 that no fire-fight took place. In the earlier versions, Al-Kuwaiti {{is said to}} have opened fire on the first team of SEALs with an AK-47 from behind the guesthouse door, lightly injuring a SEAL with bullet fragments. A short firefight took place between al-Kuwaiti and the SEALs, in which al-Kuwaiti was killed. His wife Mariam was allegedly shot and wounded in the right shoulder. The courier's male relative Abrar was then said to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> and killed by the SEALs' second team {{on the first floor of}} the main house as shots had already been fired and the SEALs thought that he was armed with a loaded AK-47 (this was later confirmed to be true in the official report). A woman near him, later identified as Abrar's wife Bushra, was in this version also shot and killed. Bin Laden's young adult son {{is said to have}} encountered the SEALs on the staircase of the main house, and to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> and killed by the second team. An unnamed U.S. senior defense official stated that only one of the five people killed, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, was armed. The interior of the house was pitch dark, because CIA operatives had cut the power to the neighborhood. However, the SEALs wore night vision goggles.|$|E
5|$|Battle Hill was {{the site}} of {{especially}} brutal fighting, with the Americans inflicting the highest number of casualties against the British troops during the entire Battle of Long Island. Among those killed was British Colonel James Grant, which led the Americans to believe that they had killed General James Grant. He was alleged to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> by a Pennsylvanian rifleman who had been sniping at the British from up in a tree. Among the American dead was Pennsylvania Colonel Caleb Parry, who was killed while rallying his troops.|$|E
5|$|Each {{level has}} set {{goals in the}} fields of {{financial}} attainment, hospital reputation, patients cured, and hospital value. Holding negative funds or allowing sufficient patients to die will bring about losing requirements. When the goals have been met the player has the option to move on to a new, more elaborate hospital with tougher winning conditions and more diseases present, or stick with their current one. If enough rats <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shot,</b> the player is taken to a special level whose goal is to shoot as many as possible.|$|E

The sole survivor is a man named Babcock, who reveals that he has saved the alien corpse from theft by burying it. Together, the three men bring the corpse to the United States. There, Mulder and Arlinsky perform an autopsy on the corpse, believing it belongs to a genuine extraterrestrial. After Mulder leaves to meet with Scully, a mysterious assassin, Scott Ostelhoff, arrives and kills Arlinsky.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the film}} began after {{production}} had finished on The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996). Instead of another musical, the production team decided to do an action-adventure film inspired by the works of Jules Verne. Atlantis was notable for adopting the distinctive visual style of comic book creator Mike Mignola. At {{the time of its}} release, the film had made greater use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) than any of Disney's previous traditionally animated features; it remains one of the few to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> in anamorphic format. Linguist Marc Okrand created a language specifically for use in Atlantis, with James Newton Howard providing the film's score. The film was released at a time when audience interest in animated films was shifting away from hand-drawn animation toward films with full CGI.|$|E
5|$|Leutnants Rüdenberg and Bellen had {{returned}} to base, as had {{the rest of the}} Jasta 10 pilots. The only one with news was Heldmann, who reported Voss headed toward British lines while pursued by a British SE.5. Timm and Rueser waited anxiously for his return as the sun set. The fact that Voss was missing in action was communicated to wing headquarters; telephone queries were made of all friendly airfields within range. Late that night, a German frontline unit reported seeing six British machines shoot down a lone German aircraft that fell within the British trenches. Heldmann refused to believe Voss was killed in aerial combat; he claimed Voss had to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> after crawling from the wreckage.|$|E
50|$|Singleton <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> {{through the}} right arm, {{although}} he did not realise this until the group had driven off. He survived.

Wright and Hurle were hospitalised but died the following day.|$|R

5|$|Posted to England in June 1943, Balmer took {{command of}} No.467 Squadron RAAF, flying Avro Lancasters {{in the air}} war over Europe. He led his unit through the Battle of Berlin from November 1943 to March 1944. In April {{he was awarded the}} Distinguished Flying Cross, and the {{following}} month promoted to temporary group captain. Days later, on the night of 11/12 May, the last scheduled operation of his tour as No.467 Squadron's commanding officer, Balmer failed to return from a mission over Belgium. Initially posted as missing, his plane was later confirmed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> down, and all of the crew killed. Balmer was buried outside Brussels.|$|E
5|$|The II./Jagdgeschwader 77 (JG 77; II Group Fighter Wing 77)—under {{the command}} of Oberstleutnant Carl-August Schumacher—took off from Nordholz Airbase and intercepted No. 9 Squadron. Feldwebels Hans Troitzsch and Alfred Held each claimed a victory and Leutnant Metz another. These {{aircraft}} from No. 9 Squadron were the first RAF aircraft to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> down by enemy fighters {{during the war and}} Troitzsch was most likely to have been the first enemy pilot to shoot one down. Another four Blenheims of No. 107 Squadron were shot down by anti-aircraft artillery fire. The Germans believed their air defences had established an effective defence from Allied attack. Use of the early Freya radar had given the German fighters eight minutes warning of their approach.|$|E
5|$|The {{critically}} endangered California condor {{has also}} been affected by lead poisoning. As scavengers, condors eat carcasses of game that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> but not retrieved, and with them the fragments from lead bullets; this increases their lead levels. Among condors around the Grand Canyon, lead poisoning due to eating lead shot is the most frequently diagnosed cause of death. In an effort to protect this species, in areas designated as the California condor's range the use of projectiles containing lead has been banned to hunt deer, feral pigs, elk, pronghorn antelope, coyotes, ground squirrels, and other non-game wildlife. Also, conservation programs exist which routinely capture condors, check their blood lead levels, and treat cases of poisoning.|$|E

5|$|Hanada and Kasuga {{pick up a}} car {{designated}} for the job which unexpectedly has a corpse in the back seat. They dispose of the body, then meet the client and proceed towards their destination. En route Hanada spots an ambush. He dispatches a number of gunmen while Kasuga panics and flails about in hysterics. Foaming at the mouth, Kasuga charges an ambusher, Koh, the fourth-ranked hitman, and they kill each other. Hanada leaves the client to secure Koh's car but hears three gunshots and rushes back to find the client is safe and three additional ambushers <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> cleanly through the forehead. At a second ambush, Hanada kills more gunmen and sets Sakura, the second-ranked hitman, on fire. Sakura madly rushes towards the client but is shot dead by him. On his way home Hanada's car breaks down. Misako, a mysterious woman with a deathwish, stops and gives him a ride. At home, he has rough sex with his wife, fueled by his obsession with sniffing boiling rice.|$|E
5|$|The killings were methodical. After the {{condemned}} individual's personal information was checked and approved, he was handcuffed {{and led to}} a cell insulated with stacks of sandbags along the walls, and a heavy, felt-lined door. The victim was told to kneel {{in the middle of the}} cell, and was then approached from behind by the executioner and immediately shot in the back of the head or neck. The body was carried out through the opposite door and laid in one of the five or six waiting trucks, whereupon the next condemned was taken inside and subjected to the same fate. In addition to muffling by the rough insulation in the execution cell, the pistol gunshots were also masked by the operation of loud machines (perhaps fans) throughout the night. Some post-1991 revelations suggest that prisoners were also executed in the same manner at the NKVD headquarters in Smolensk, though judging by the way that the corpses were stacked, some captives may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> while standing on the edge of the mass graves. This procedure went on every night, except for the public May Day holiday.|$|E
25|$|The {{security}} forces blamed the killing on the IRA. In October 1973, however, the Belfast Telegraph {{published an article}} suggesting that Smith could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> by the MRF. Documents uncovered from the British National Archives reveal that the MRF fired shots {{in the area that}} night. They claim to have fired at two gunmen and hit one of them. The Belfast Telegraph article also suggested that Smith could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shot</b> by the IRA, who fired on the car thinking it was carrying MRF members. The IRA deny this and claim that it was not in the area {{at the time of the}} shooting.|$|E
