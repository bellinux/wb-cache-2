40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest in cross flow turbines (also known as Banki turbines) for small and low head applications because of their simple structure as well as low capital and maintenance costs. The present work aims at implementing the direct drive turbine (DDT) of cross flow type for wave power generation. A numerical wave tank was used to simulate the waves and after obtaining the desired wave properties; the augmentation channel plus the <b>front</b> <b>guide</b> nozzle and rear chamber were integrated to the numerical wave tank. The waves in the numerical wave tank were generated by a piston type wave maker which was located at the wave tank inlet. The inlet which was modeled as a plate wall moved sinusoidally with the general function x = asinωt. The augmentation channel consisted of a front nozzle, rear nozzle and an internal fluid region which represented the turbine housing. The front and rear nozzles were geometrically the same. Three different <b>front</b> <b>guide</b> nozzle configurations were studied: a standard guide nozzle which was originally attached to the augmentation channel and two other <b>front</b> <b>guide</b> nozzles of different geometries. The {{purpose of this study}} is to observe how the <b>front</b> <b>guide</b> nozzle shape influences the flow downstream, mainly in the augmentation channel, water power and the first stage energy conversion. The analysis was performed using a commercial CFD code ANSYS-CFX. The results of the flow in the augmentation channel for the three <b>front</b> <b>guide</b> nozzles are presented in this paper...|$|E

Renewable energy is the energy that is obtained from the never ending and free currents of energy occurring in the natural environment.

The present paper explores the possibility of utilizing a direct drive turbine of cross flow type to extract power from waves. The primary objective is to maximize the energy conversion by making changes to the <b>front</b> <b>guide</b> nozzle and the rear chamber. The simulation was carried out using commercial CFD code ANSYS CFX. The base model recorded water power (PWP) of 29. 9 W. Upon the completion of modifications, the model with Guide 5 <b>front</b> <b>guide</b> nozzle and a rear chamber with upper fillet radius (RU) of 40 mm and lower fillet radius (RL) of 0 mm recorded the highest power of 37. 1 W.

The goal is to understand spreading and invasions in this heterogeneous context. We prove the existence of a threshold value on the existence of a nonzero asymptotic profile (a stationary limiting solution). When a nonzero asymptotic profile exists, we prove the existence of a traveling front. This allows us to completely identify the behavior of the solution of the parabolic problem in the KPP case. We also study here the bistable case. The equation provides a general framework for a model of cortical spreading depressions in the brain. We prove the existence of traveling front if the area where theere is reaction is large enough and the non-existence if it is too small...|$|R

Methods. 62 eyes with progressive keratoconus {{were divided into two}} groups; the first including 30 eyes underwent simultaneous WFG PRK with accelerated CXL. The second including 32 eyes underwent subsequent WFG PRK performed 6 months later after accelerated CXL. Visual, refractive, topographic, and aberrometric data were determined preoperatively and during 1 -year follow-up period and the results compared in between the 2 studied groups. Results. All evaluated visual, refractive, and aberrometric parameters demonstrated highly significant improvement in both studied groups (all P< 0. 001). A significant improvement was observed in keratometric and Q values. The improvement in all parameters was stable till the end of follow-up. Likewise, no significant difference was determined in between the 2 groups in any of recorded parameters. Subjective data revealed similarly significant improvement in both groups. Conclusions. WFG PRK and accelerated CXL is an effective and safe option to improve the vision in mild to moderate keratoconus.

40|$|Introduction & Objective: This {{study was}} {{performed}} to compare the visual and refractive outcomes of photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) in eyes with medium-high astigmatism by WF-guided method using Visx system and cross-cylinder method using Nidek EC- 5000 excimer laser system. 　Although there are many studies about efficacy and safety of Wave <b>front</b> <b>guided</b> and Cross Cylinder Photorefractive Keratectomy, there are few studies on moderate to high astigmatism. Materials & Methods: In a descriptive comparative study, WF-PRK was performed on 50 eyes of 25 patients with compound myopic astigmatism. Each patient underwent PRK by WF-guided approach. Then the results were compared with the cross-cylinder PRK previously performed on 48 eyes of 24 patients. Results: After 6 months, 100 % of the eyes in the WF group had uncorrected visual acuity of 20 / 25 or better compared to 79. 2 % in the cross-cylinder group. Mean refractive astigmatism had decreased by 1. 57 ± 0. 53 in the WF group and 1. 67  0. 52 in the cross-cylinder group (P= 0. 75). Mean postoperative absolute change in total root-mean-square higher order aberrations in the WF group and cross-cylinder group were 0. 05  0. 22 µm and 0. 17  0. 20 µm, respectively (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: Both methods of PRK using the Nidek EC- 5000 and visx excimer laser systems are effective for correcting medium-high astigmatism. WF approach is more successful in improving the refractive results. (Sci J Hamadan Univ Med Sci 2010; 17 (3) : 19 - 24...|$|R

Patients and methods: An interventional case series that included 40 eyes suffering from myopia who were candidates for LASIK. All underwent Wave <b>Front</b> <b>Guided</b> LASIK by the same surgeon using the VisX CustomVue platform. A corneal flap was created in 20 eyes using a mechanical microkeratome Moria M 2 (MMK), while the IFS IntraLase™ was used in the remaining 20 eyes. Mean suction time was recorded from “Suction ON” to “Suction OFF” time. Optic cube and RNFL thickness analysis using Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) Cirrus-HD was completed before, and 1 month after LASIK. Results: The study included 40 eyes of 20 patients. All were females with mean age 33. 5 ± 6. 4 years. Mean preoperative spherical equivalent was − 3. 62 ± 2. 31 D. Average preoperative RNFL thickness was 94. 6 ± 12. 1 µm in MMK group while the postoperative average thickness was 95. 1 ± 11. 9 um with no statistically significant difference (P-value: 0. 37). Average preoperative RNFL thickness was 108. 28 ± 8. 4 µm in FS group compared to 108. 38 ± 11. 2 µm in the postoperative average with no statistically significant difference (P-value: 0. 94). Mean “Suction ON” to “Suction OFF” time was 22 seconds in the MMK group compared to 41 seconds in the FS group.
