Municipal waste contains organically degradable components, at which decomposition occurs landfill biogas. For the creation of landfill gas there must be strictly anaerobic environment conditions and sufficient humidity. Creation of gas also affects the temperature, pH and the composition of the decomposed material. To prevent the free release of methane, operators of municipal landfills have an obligation to collect and process landfill gas.
