40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the role of gold in the global {{financial}} system. We test the hypothesis that gold represents a safe haven against stocks of major emerging and developing countries. A descriptive and econometric analysis for a sample spanning a 30 Â year period from 1979 to 2009 shows that gold is both a hedge and a safe haven for major European stock markets and the US but not for Australia, Canada, Japan and large emerging markets such as the BRIC countries. We also distinguish between a weak and strong form of the safe haven and argue that gold may act as a stabilizing force for the financial system by reducing losses in the face of extreme negative market shocks. Looking at specific crisis periods, we find that gold was a strong safe haven for most developed markets during the peak of the recent <b>financial</b> crisis. <b>Gold</b> Safe haven <b>Financial</b> markets Uncertainty...|$|R

50|$|After the 1906 earthquake, global {{discussion}} arose {{concerning a}} legally flawless {{exclusion of the}} earthquake hazard from fire insurance contracts. It was pressed ahead mainly by re-insurers. Their aim; a uniform solution to insurance payouts resulting from fires cause by earthquakes. Until 1910, a few countries, especially in Europe, followed the call for an exclusion of the earthquake hazard from all fire insurance contracts. In the U.S., the question was discussed differently. But the traumatized public reacted with fierce opposition. On August 1, 1909, the California Senate enacted the California Standard Form of Fire Insurance Policy, which did not contain any earthquake clause. Thus the state decided that insurers {{would have to pay}} again if another earthquake was followed by fires. Other earthquake-endangered countries followed the California example. The insurance payments heavily affected the international <b>financial</b> system. <b>Gold</b> transfers from European insurance companies to policyholders in San Francisco led to a rise in interest rates, subsequently to a lack of available loans and finally to the Knickerbocker Trust Company crisis of October 1907 which led to the Panic of 1907.|$|R

Besides, introducing new rules could prevent some bad financial practices such as riba, maysir, gharar, and speculation.

Correlation analysis is also used to examine the portfolio diversification benefits of housing. Additionally, the relationship between housing performance and inflation is investigated. The results show that housing is an effective property investment vehicle as it delivers the lowest risk-to-reward ratio when compared with three major assets over this study period. In addition, the results suggest that adding housing in properties can provide more diversification benefits. Moreover, housing returns exceed the rate of inflation and also there is a positive and significant relationship between housing returns and the rate of inflation.

40|$|Indian {{economy is}} exposed to various forms of uncertainty. Theories of {{investment}} underuncertainty and real options predict that increased uncertainty tends to depress real investment. Literature finds that uncertainties regarding oil price and real exchange rate adversely affect domestic capital formation. The socio-economic realities of India together {{with the lack of}} penetration of formal <b>financial</b> institutions make <b>gold</b> as a one of the main modes of investment for Indian households. However, over-investment in gold may have adverse consequences for the real economy as it drives away resources from productive capital. Moreover, higher inflation uncertainty makes it harder to extract information from the price system and thus may reduce economic efficiency. In this paper, we use a bivariate GARCH-in-mean VAR model to estimate the interrelationships of various uncertainty measures and the real economy. We find that the Indian economy is not particularly vulnerable to real exchange rate or oil price uncertainties. However, gold price uncertainty has a significant positive effect on output growth. Higher WPI inflation uncertainty is detrimental to growth rates of private consumption expenditure and gross capital formation. Moreover, a rise in the growth rate of government expenditure following a positive CPI inflation shock may partially explain the lack of any detrimental effect on output growth.

From 2011 to 2015, the period of our data collection, countries with developing economies had a disproportionately greater share of articles published in the lower-tier mega-journals and thus paid article APCs that cross-subsidize publications in the top-tier journals of the same publisher. Conversely, scientists from Western developed countries had a disproportionately greater share of articles published in those same top-tier journals. The global inequity of the cross-subsidizing APC model was demonstrated across five different mega-journals, showing that the issue is a common problem.

30|$|South Africa is {{a country}} rich in the {{platinum}} group metals (PGMs) particularly platinum and palladium {{and it is the}} largest producer of platinum and second largest producer of palladium (Matthey 2014) accounting for 96 % of known PGMs global reserves. In addition to accounting for a significant proportion of global mineral production and resources, the contribution of the PGMs to South Africa economically and otherwise cannot be over-emphasized. For instance, on average from 2008 to 2013, the percentage contribution to the South African GDP from this sector was 2.3 % with a yearly increase of 3.3 % and a head count of 191 781 in direct employment. Further, PGMs also play significant roles in the investment arena (Batten et al. 2010). Since platinum and palladium are two of the major precious metals that offer different volatility and returns of lower correlations with stocks at both sector and market levels, they are some of the attractive asset classes eligible for portfolio diversification (Arouri et al. 2012) which appear more likely to act as a <b>financial</b> instrument than <b>gold.</b> Recently, palladium has entered the Johannesburg Securities Exchange (JSE) as exchange traded funds (ETF). Two palladium funds, Standard Bank AfricaPalladium ETF and Absa Capital newPalladium ETF have been launched in March of 2014 on the JSE. These exchange traded funds are backed by the physical palladium metal. Also, the roles of the PMGs in the the medical field (e.g., their use in anticancer complexes) and industrial catalysis are ever-advancing. Given this background, investigating the mechanisms which generate these data returns and their related dynamics are of paramount importance to policy makers, regulators, traders and investors globally.|$|R
40|$|International {{currency}} or production asset? Safe haven or classical commodity? This thesis offers {{insights into}} the <b>financial</b> implications of <b>gold</b> and silver by focusing on three distinct investigations motivated by a brief history {{on the role of}} the two precious metals in fiscal and financial politics, and underpinned by a thorough literature review identifying research fields that are better explored than others. A first investigation offers {{insights into the}} relationship between precious metals and a set of different inflation measures in the United States of America, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and Japan. A clean and modern methodology uncovers time-variation in the relationship between precious metals and inflation for all countries; but also the superiority of silver as a hedging tool in the United Kingdom and Japan. The second focus of this thesis is set around model specification and relies on a complex big data methodology allowing the computation of millions of possible realistic scenarios in order to discover possible variables associated with price movements of gold and silver. While results point towards the importance of classical variables such as the US Dollar and inflation, other less traditional variables appear to be more important than initially suggested - such as the UK economic uncertainty index or the S&P Case-Shiller national home price index. The final research question considered offers unique insights into the drivers of physical gold and silver demand for a large set of countries. A combination of sophisticated linear and dynamic panel data models is applied and empirical insights are obtained. Results for gold point towards a positive relationship with short-term yields and economic uncertainty, while stronger country-specific effects are uncovered for silver...|$|R
