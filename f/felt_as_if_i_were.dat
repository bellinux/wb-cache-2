2500|$|The album {{did receive}} {{some level of}} criticism, though. thenewreview.net stated [...] "With songs like 'Ride Insane' 'Here and Now' and 'Nowhere', I became a little bored. I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> {{listening}} to songs I had already heard before by the band, or perhaps even elsewhere, and wasn’t completely blown away by what was there." [...] Guitarinternational.com stated [...] "Cold Day Memory is a killer release, and one that should act to propel the band into the new decade with {{a renewed sense of}} confidence, hopefully forgetting, at least somewhat, the events that haunted them {{for the majority of the}} past decade. If this record is any indication of things to come, then we could be hearing great things from a band that has more than paid their dues, and come screaming back onto the scene, leaving no doubt that they deserve to be included next to the biggest names in Metal today." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2002, Pisces V and {{her sister}} vessel Pisces IV {{discovered}} a Japanese midget submarine; sunk on December 7, 1941 by the destroyer [...] in the first American shots fired in World War II, the submarine {{was hit by a}} 4"/50caliber gun shot and depth charged shortly before the attack on Pearl Harbor began. The submarine was found in [...] of water about [...] off the mouth of Pearl Harbor. This was the culmination of a 61-year search for the vessel and has been called [...] "the most significant modern marine archeological find ever in the Pacific, second only to the finding of Titanic in the Atlantic". In 2003, Pisces V visited the Japanese midget submarine it had found in Pearl Harbor the year before. The U.S. State Department worked in conjunction with the Japanese Foreign Ministry to determine Japanese wishes regarding the fate of the midget submarine. The submersibles are used by HURL as teaching devices. In 2008, two members of the Tampa Bay Chapter of SCUBAnauts were invited to team with HURL and to visit the historic wreck of the Japanese submarine. One SCUBAnaut said as he stepped on Pisces V that [...] "it looked and <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> in a space shuttle preparing for lift-off".|$|E

6000|$|... 'Don't,' said Gethryn pathetically. 'The {{only time}} I've ever <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> really {{was going to}} make that century. By Jove, see that drive? Pringle seems all right.' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{stopped to}} kiss me on the forehead, and I sobbed and wept afresh. For <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could not bear the painful delight of his praise.|$|R
6000|$|... "I couldn't help it, Janet," [...] said Anne repentantly. [...] "I just <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{had stood}} by and seen murder done. I HAD to run after him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why did you stay, my dear?" [...] I groaned. [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> {{personally}} smothering Mrs. Bentley {{every moment}} we were there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ever since I {{arrived in}} it, I've <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> a mere piece of baggage, to be hustled along anyway without my wishes counting." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{earth was}} praising God that Sunday as I rode to Mr. Bordley's. And {{as it is}} sorrow which lifts us nearest to heaven, I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> in church.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{should go}} wild <b>if</b> <b>I</b> didn't come—if I didn't rush. I didn't {{know how you}} might have taken me, Lettie when I said—what I did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I couldn't help it,' again {{said the}} girl. 'The river noise was so like everything--and I knew the way--and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> must go before any one was up.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If He's {{as good as}} {{your father}} He'll do for me," [...] said Mary. [...] "When your father was talking to me <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> never could be bad any more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ostrog has discipline--he has plans. Do you know, {{out there}} just now I felt--. When I heard that these {{aeroplanes}} were a stage nearer. I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> fighting {{the machinery of}} fate." ...|$|E
60|$|We vanished. In {{five minutes}} {{we were on}} board the ship. To this hour I have no remembrance of how we got on board. My brain swam with intense excitement. I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> flying, not walking, as I ran about the deck and clambered up the rigging.|$|E
60|$|I {{could see}} no more--my heart swelled into my throat--my eyes filled with tears; I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> acting a barbarous part in {{standing}} by and gazing idly on this scene of maternal anguish. I wandered {{to another part of}} the churchyard, where I remained until the funeral train had dispersed.|$|E
6000|$|... "He--he sort of {{degraded}} me. He {{wanted to}} bully {{me because he}} hadn't got me. And then <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> wanted to run, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was fastened and bound up. And he seemed dirty." ...|$|R
6000|$|I had {{no sooner}} spoken than I repented of my words; he grew so pale that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had struck him. [...] "Ah, 'lived'--!" [...] he murmured, turning short away from me.|$|R
6000|$|At that moment--for {{a moment}} only--I almost <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{could have said}} to Effie, [...] "Take him!" [...] but the thing was too impossible--a {{something}} within us rises against it--and I said nothing.|$|R
60|$|I was staggered. I did not relish this un{{accountable}} change. If I {{had persuaded}} him to go, {{it would have been}} all right; but to find him thus ready and eager was unnatural. I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> accountable for this change in his opinions and actions, and immediately, strange to say, experienced a tendency to dissuade him.|$|E
60|$|During the {{remainder}} of that day I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> in a horrible dream. I scarce knew what was said to me, and was more than once blamed by the men for idling my time. At last the hour to return aboard came. We marched down to the beach, and I felt relief {{for the first time}} when my feet rested on the schooner's deck.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{sat still}} {{and looked at}} him, I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> frozen, turned to stone. And after a long while, since I would not speak to him, he went out... Three months later {{he came back and}} said that I had {{misunderstood}} him, that he couldn't live without me. I sent him away.... Only the other day he married Amy Grant, one of my friends....|$|E
6000|$|I had {{no sooner}} spoken than I repented of my words; he grew so pale that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had struck him. [...] "Ah, 'lived'-- !" [...] he murmured, turning short away from me.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{had stepped}} on {{the place where the}} last stair ought to have been, but wasn't. <b>I</b> felt defiant, <b>if</b> you know what I mean, and there didn't seem {{anything}} to defy.|$|R
60|$|After {{two days}} and nights, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had lived there for a year, and yet I was not an hour older, but was quite as much tormented by my own youthfulness as ever.|$|R
60|$|I went to Clark's office, {{found he}} had left, and {{followed}} him to his rooms. The minute I saw him I experienced the same nasty feeling of lost or bewildered individuality which always overcame me in his presence. He was so absurdly like me. I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> looking into a mirror where my reflection persisted in doing things I didn't do, thereby producing a most uncanny sensation.|$|E
60|$|The instant I said that, I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> {{imbued with}} a {{determination}} {{that nothing could}} shake. Jack's reasoning never once came into my mind. I took down the knapsack that hung on a nail ready packed for the intended fishing expedition of the morrow. I buckled it on; put on my thickest shoes, and, seizing a stout cudgel, issued softly from my apartment, and tapped gently at Jack's door.|$|E
60|$|I {{stood up}} and {{followed}} {{her out of the}} garden. We walked side by side down our lane, under the willows and out to the road, which lay long and still in that bright, calm moonshine. I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> in a dream, moving at the bidding of a will not my own, which I could not have disputed even if I had wished to do so. But I did not wish it; I had only the feeling of a strange, boundless content.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Well, if {{you don't}} call that scandylos——!' said old Ma Stainwright, and Meg began to cry. You don't know, Cyril! She sobbed fit to break her heart. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{could have killed}} him.|$|R
5000|$|... the raw honesty {{of emotion}} from {{individuals}} I might have stereotyped as unemotional macho men...As I touched each letter, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was {{being allowed to}} touch {{the life of the}} person who wrote it.|$|R
5000|$|William Nicholson, {{writer of}} Shadowlands (1985) and Gladiator (2000), said: “I hate this film. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was {{watching}} all my own excuses {{for not doing}} anything about climate change being stripped away from me.” ...|$|R
60|$|I dragged {{myself from}} the ground. As I gained my tottering feet, for now that all was over I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> made of running water, I saw the men who held Ragnall loose their grip of him. He sprang to where his wife was and stood before her as though confused, much as Jana had stood, Jana against whose head he rested, his left hand holding to the brute's {{gigantic}} tusk, for I think that he also was weak with toil, terror, loss of blood and emotion.|$|E
60|$|I thanked her, and {{presently}} {{found myself}} before a large stove, {{on which it}} was evident, from the odors, that supper was preparing. In a certain way the heat was grateful, but {{in less than a}} minute I was bound to admit to myself that I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> enveloped in a vast warm poultice. The little man and his wife--if wife she were, for she looked big enough to be his mother, and young enough to be his daughter--stood talking in the hall, and I could hear every word they said.|$|E
60|$|Gradually {{a change}} crept over the letters I received. Without ever affording the {{slightest}} {{clue to the}} identity of their writer they grew more intimate and personal. A subtle, caressing note of tenderness breathed from them and thrilled my heart curiously. I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> being drawn into the writer's life, admitted into the most sacred recesses of his thoughts and feelings. Yet it was all done so subtly, so delicately, that I was unconscious of the change until I discovered it in reading over the older letters and comparing them with the later ones.|$|E
60|$|I {{tried to}} make Pearse's point of view clear. Before this old man, with his {{inflexible}} will and sense of duty, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> held a brief for Zachary, and must try to do him justice.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' said Anne, 'I never <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> knew or liked her. I believe Rupert and I {{were very}} unkind {{to her in}} our younger days; but, oh! {{she was the most}} {{tiresome}} whining child I ever knew.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well for me I did not perish {{with these}} wild thoughts! I am glad I {{have told you}} at last. <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> ought to confess it, and yet I was ashamed. Is the thing safe?' ...|$|R
