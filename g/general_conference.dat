5|$|Reflecting its Methodist heritage, the IPHC {{is governed}} under the {{principles}} of connectionalism, a mixed system of episcopal and congregational polity. Authority in the church is shared between local churches, quadrennial conferences, and the <b>General</b> <b>Conference.</b>|$|E
50|$|Functions of <b>General</b> <b>Conferences</b> are extensive. <b>General</b> <b>Conferences</b> {{determine}} their Agency's broad policy direction. <b>General</b> <b>Conferences</b> also elect the Agency's Director General {{and members of}} the Agency's standing executive board, while also approving States for membership or suspending a state therefrom.|$|R

5|$|Although the originators {{intended}} {{to devise a}} system that was equally accessible to all, it proved necessary to use prototype units {{in the custody of}} national or local authorities as standards. Control of the prototype units of measure was maintained by the later French governments until 1875, when it was passed to an international intergovernmental organisation, the <b>General</b> <b>Conference</b> on Weights and Measures (CGPM).|$|E

5|$|In 1927, the International Conference on Weights and Measures {{redefined the}} meter {{in terms of}} a red cadmium {{spectral}} line (1 m = 1,553,164.13 wavelengths). This definition has since been changed (see krypton). At the same time, the International Prototype Meter was used as standard for the length of a meter until 1960, when at the <b>General</b> <b>Conference</b> on Weights and Measures the meter was defined in terms of the orange-red emission line in the electromagnetic spectrum of the krypton-86 atom in vacuum.|$|E

5|$|The International Labour Organisation {{was created}} in 1919 {{on the basis of}} Part XIII of the Treaty of Versailles. The ILO, {{although}} having the same members as the League and being subject to the budget control of the Assembly, was an autonomous organisation with its own Governing Body, its own <b>General</b> <b>Conference</b> and its own Secretariat. Its constitution differed from that of the League: representation had been accorded not only to governments but also to representatives of employers' and workers' organisations. Albert Thomas was its first director.|$|E
5|$|The church {{formally}} {{announced the}} change on June 9, 1978.

The announcement was formally approved by the church at the October 1978 <b>general</b> <b>conference</b> and is included in LDS Church's edition of the Doctrine and Covenants as Official Declaration 2.|$|E

50|$|John W. Gowdy {{was elected}} a Bishop by the 1930 {{meeting of the}} China Central Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church. He served as a Bishop in this Central Conference until 1941.

5|$|Until 1875, the French {{government}} {{owned the}} prototype metre and kilogram, {{but in that}} year the Convention of the metre was signed, {{and control of the}} standards relating to mass and length passed to a trio of inter-governmental organisations, the senior of which was the <b>General</b> <b>Conference</b> on Weights and Measures (in French the Conférence générale des poids et mesures or CGPM). During {{the first half of the}} 20th century, the CGPM cooperated with a number of other organisations, and by 1960 it had responsibility for defining temporal, electrical, thermal, molecular and luminar measurements, while other international organisations continued their roles in how these units of measurement were used.|$|E
5|$|When Smith {{moved to}} Kirtland, Ohio in January 1831, he {{encountered}} a religious culture that included enthusiastic demonstrations of spiritual gifts, including fits and trances, rolling on the ground, and speaking in tongues. Smith brought the Kirtland congregation {{under his own}} authority and tamed these outbursts. Rigdon's followers had also been practicing a form of communalism, which Smith adopted, calling it the United Order. Smith had promised church elders that in Kirtland they would receive an endowment of heavenly power, and at the June 1831 <b>general</b> <b>conference,</b> he introduced the greater authority of a High ("Melchizedek") Priesthood to the church hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|In November 1869 the French {{government}} issued {{invitations to}} join this commission. Spain accepted and Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero took part in the Committee of preparatory research from {{the first meeting of}} the  in 1870. He became president of the permanent Committee of the International Metre Commission in 1872. In 1874 he was elected as president of the Permanent Commission of the European Arc Measurement. He also presided the <b>General</b> <b>Conference</b> of the European Arc Measurement held in Paris in 1875, when the association decided the creation of an international geodetic standard for the bases' measurement. He represented Spain at the 1875 conference of the Metre Convention, which was ratified the same year in Paris. The Spanish geodesist was elected as the first president of the International Committee for Weights and Measures. His activities resulted in the distribution of a platinum and iridium prototype of the metre to all States parties to the Metre Convention during the first meeting of the General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1889. Theses prototypes defined the metre right up until 1960.|$|E

5|$|On October 4 the Richards party reached Salt Lake City and conferred with {{president}} Brigham Young and other Church leaders. The {{next morning the}} Church was meeting in a <b>general</b> <b>conference,</b> where Young and the other speakers called on the Church members to provide wagons, mules, supplies, and teamsters for a rescue mission. On the morning of October 7 the first rescue party left Salt Lake City with 16 wagon-loads of food and supplies, pulled by four-mule teams with 27 young men serving as teamsters and rescuers. The party elected George D. Grant as their captain. Throughout October more wagon trains were assembled, {{and by the end}} of the month 250 relief wagons were on the road.|$|E
5|$|The International Prototype Kilogram was {{commissioned}} by the <b>General</b> <b>Conference</b> on Weights and Measures (CGPM) {{under the authority of}} the Metre Convention (1875), and in the custody of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) who hold it on behalf of the CGPM. After the International Prototype Kilogram had been found to vary in mass over time relative to its reproductions, the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) recommended in 2005 that the kilogram be redefined in terms of a fundamental constant of nature. At its 2011 meeting, the CGPM agreed in principle that the kilogram should be redefined in terms of the Planck constant. The decision was originally deferred until 2014; in 2014 it was deferred again until the next meeting. There are currently several different proposals for the redefinition (some of which have been abandoned); these are described in the Proposed Future Definitions section below.|$|E
