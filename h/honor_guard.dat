In the USA, military <b>honor</b> <b>guards</b> may serve as ambassadors to the public, presenting a positive image of their service, and assisting with the recruiting effort.|$|R

5|$|After thirty-four {{hours of}} lying in state, {{the doors of}} the Capitol were closed to the public and Nancy Reagan was escorted in, where she had a moment alone with the casket. A {{military}} <b>honor</b> <b>guard</b> entered and carried it down the west steps of the Capitol to a 21-gun salute where Nancy, holding her hand over her heart, met it.

On Wednesday, September 17, 1996, he {{was due to}} play tennis with a friend, but collapsed at his summer home in Ocean City the night before, and {{was taken to the}} hospital where he died the next day. The cause of death was acute leukemia, previously undiagnosed. The funeral, at Timonium, Maryland, was mainly confined to family; Buchanan and some of Agnew's former Secret Service guards also attended to pay their final respects. In recognition of his service as vice president, an <b>honor</b> <b>guard</b> of the combined military services fired a 21-gun salute at the graveside. Agnew's wife Judith survived him by 16 years, dying at Rancho Mirage on June 20, 2012.|$|E
5|$|Ponce Vaides {{was allowed}} {{to leave the country}} safely, as was Ubico himself. The {{military}} junta was replaced by another three-person junta consisting of Árbenz, Arana, and an upper-class youth named Jorge Toriello, who had {{played a significant role in}} the protests. Although Arana had come to the military conspiracy relatively late, his defection had brought the powerful Guardia de Honor (<b>Honor</b> <b>Guard)</b> over to the revolutionaries, and for this crucial role he was rewarded with a place on the junta. The junta promised free and open elections to the presidency and the congress, as well as for a constituent assembly.|$|E

5|$|Benjamin Boyce died in 1928 {{of a heart}} embolism. His {{father did}} not arrive home until after his son's death. Boyce was so saddened over his son's death that his own health suffered. One of Boyce's last efforts was to publish his son's letters from his South Seas expeditions: Dear Dad Letters from New Guinea. Boyce died from {{bronchial}} pneumonia on June 11, 1929, in Chicago and was buried in his adopted hometown of Ottawa, Illinois, on June 13, 1929, in the Ottawa Avenue Cemetery, with West delivering the eulogy. Boy Scouts maintained an <b>honor</b> <b>guard</b> with an American flag in a heavy rainstorm in two-hour shifts at his Ottawa home and 32 Boy Scouts were chosen as honorary pallbearers.

5|$|Eldred {{was born}} in Brooklyn, New York, and raised in Oceanside, Long Island, New York by his mother after his father died. Eldred’s older brother, Hubert W. Eldred, was {{instrumental}} in starting Troop 1 of Oceanside, Long Island, New York in November 1910. Troop1 was fully uniformed and their appearance so impressed Chief Scout Executive James E. West that he asked the troop to serve as <b>honor</b> <b>guard</b> for the visit of Baden-Powell, the founder of Scouting. West paid the expenses for the troop to travel to New York harbor for Baden-Powell's arrival {{in the morning of}} January 31, 1912. Baden-Powell inspected Troop1, and spoke with Eldred at some length. It is uncertain how Baden-Powell found out that Eldred's Board of Review was that afternoon, but he ended up attending it and being part of the Board of Review.|$|E
