Congressional Republicans challenged her on several points, to which she responded. In particular, after persistent questioning {{about whether or not the}} administration had issued inaccurate [...] "talking points" [...] after the attack, Clinton responded with the much-quoted rejoinder, [...] "With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they'd they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make?

2500|$|The word patriation {{was coined}} in Canada as a {{back-formation}} from repatriation (returning to one's country). Prior to 1982, the Canadian constitution was held by, and modified by, the United Kingdom (on {{request from the}} Parliament of Canada); hence some have felt that the term patriation was more suitable than the term repatriation (returning something). The term was first used in 1966 by Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson {{in response to a}} question in parliament: [...] "We intend to <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> have the constitution of Canada repatriated, or patriated." ...|$|E

So we're {{going to get to the}} bottom of it, and then we're going to <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> work to prevent it from happening again." [...] Regarding the different explanations afterward for what had happened, she said, [...] "In the wake of an attack like this, in the fog of war, there's always going to be confusion. And I think it is absolutely fair to say that everyone had the same intelligence. Everyone who spoke tried to give the information that they had. As time has gone on, that information has changed. We've gotten more detail, but that's not surprising. That always happens." ...|$|E

And when somebody does {{what he wants to do}} - it's going to be hard to prevent anything. But I think people are going to have to take steps in their own lives to take precautions. To protect themselves. And in situations like that, you know, try to stay safe. As somebody said — get small.” ...|$|E

[...] In an interview with Vox he stated his opposition to an open borders immigration policy, describing it as:...a right-wing proposal, which says essentially there is no United States...you're doing away {{with the concept of}} a nation-state. [...] What right-wing people in this country would love is an open-border policy. Bring in all kinds of people, work for $2 or $3 an hour, that would be great for them. I don’t believe in that. I think we have to raise wages in this country, I think we have to <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> create millions of jobs.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 May, it was {{revealed}} that the British Government rejected a proposal by the Palestinian Authority to use force in a possible rescue attempt to free Johnston, due to worries about his safety in such a situation. Ismail Haniyeh also said that progress had been made in negotiations with Johnston's kidnappers, and the kidnappers had lowered their demands for his release. The same day, British Prime Minister Tony Blair was questioned in Parliament about British efforts to free the journalist. Lee Scott, a British MP, had called on Prime Minister Blair to use the time before he stepped down from office to try to free Johnston as well as Gilad Shalit. Blair told the House of Commons that there was [...] "no conceivable reason for him (Johnston) to be kept", and that the Government would [...] "continue to <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> facilitate" [...] Johnston's release. In Ireland, top Catholic and Muslim leaders also called for his immediate release.|$|E

2500|$|Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican {{associated}} with the Tea Party movement, questioned her repeatedly on a different aspect, whether Ambassador to the UN Rice had misled the public after the attacks.

2500|$|... – In a {{press release}} from his office, Prime Minister Gordon Brown {{condemned}} the attacks in saying: [...] "I think I speak {{for the whole world}} – shock and outrage at the tragic destruction of innocent lives. I have already sent my sympathy and support to Prime Minister Singh of India and to say we will <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> help the Indian government. Our first duty is towards British citizens caught up in this terror in Mumbai. The High Commissioner has come from Delhi to visit all those who are injured – he's visiting them now. It is too early to say any numbers for the numbers of people who are injured – we will give that {{during the course of the}} day – what I can assure you is we are doing everything within our power. We've set up a crisis centre in the foreign office where British citizens can phone in, just visit it and talk to them – they've had 800 calls already. And at the same time, we're in touch with many people who are caught up in the hotels and giving advice on what they can do. Our second responsibility is obviously to root out terrorism – to help the Indian government with their action – and that's why at the same time as giving support to the Indian prime minister, we're sending police emergency teams that are well versed in Indian terrorism and we will try to give what support we can through British police and security officials to the Indian government at this time". Foreign Secretary David Miliband also condemned the attacks, characterising them as [...] "an attack on all of us, not just India".|$|E
