25|$|Presley {{had to do}} no {{more than}} provide RCA with three albums a year, and his film soundtracks <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> him. With no touring or public {{appearances}} to be made, Parker was able to keep costs to a minimum. For the first few years Presley's films were somewhat successful, his albums topped the charts, and any singles that were released were mostly hits. But as time went on, as the Beatles began their dominance of the music charts and the worldwide phenomenon known as Beatlemania began, Presley became less and less successful. His films still made money and his albums still sold well, but the profits were falling. This led Parker to insist that films be made cheaply, on a strict schedule, and with as little hassle as possible.|$|E
500|$|Julie Benz {{initially}} {{auditioned for}} the role of Buffy Summers, but that later went to Sarah Michelle Gellar, who had previously won the part of Cordelia Chase. Benz was offered the small role of the vampire Darla in the pilot episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Her performance was so well-received that her character appeared in a few more episodes. In an interview with TheTVAddict.com, Benz said of her casting: [...] "I was supposed to die in the pilot, but about halfway through the pilot Joss Whedon was like, 'We're giving you a name and we're not going to kill you.' And he <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> a while until it finally came time to kill me, and kill me, and kill me and killed [...] me." [...] She later went on to say: ...|$|E

As {{the image of her}} as a political interloper grew, she sought to explicitly deny that she was the power behind the throne. At the end of her time as First Lady, however, she said that her husband had not been well-served by his staff. She acknowledged her role in reaction in influencing him on personnel decisions, saying [...] "In no way do I apologize for it." [...] She wrote in her memoirs, [...] "I don't think I was as bad, or as extreme in my power or my weakness, as I was depicted," [...] but went on, [...] "However the first lady fits in, she has a unique and important role to play in looking after her husband. And it's only natural that she'll let him know what she thinks. I always <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> Ronnie, and I always will." ...|$|E

500|$|In the video, Dev {{is seen in}} a club {{scene with}} intense dancing. The main focus is black-painted hands and arms, which are {{prominent}} in several shots of Dev as she is standing naked while the hands are touching her body. Some of the hands were digitally added, {{but the majority of}} them were real, including the ones touching Dev. She explained, [...] "The extras were amazing, they let me paint their hands and bodies, and they stacked {{on top of each other}} and <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> hours. For takes and takes and takes." [...] The video also includes shots of an albino ball python and a tarantula. Cory Lamz of Westword wrote a positive review of the video: [...] "Watching 'In the Dark' is like dancing under a strobe light on ecstasy. In a sea of hands, literally, Dev manages to tease you, seduce you and entice you. She makes you want to touch her, just like every other hand in the video." [...] Contessa Gayles of AOL Music referred the video to as [...] "freaky" [...] and [...] "funky", writing [...] "Forget 'dancing in the dark,' Dev works it in a sea of dismembered, black-painted hands and arms in this freaky, funky new vid." [...] In contrast, Becky Bain of Idolator called it [...] "somewhat unsettling".|$|E

2500|$|The music {{came from}} Brian Wilson's first {{psychedelic}} experience. He was quoted saying in 1986, [...] " [...] something I'm {{very proud of}} in a sense because it represents the Beach Boys really greatest record production we’ve ever made. It goes back to 1965 when I was sitting in my apartment, wondering {{how to write a}} song about girls, because I love girls. I mean, everybody loves girls." [...] He added in 2007, [...] "I was thinking about the music from cowboy movies. And I sat down and started playing it, bum-buhdeeda, bum-buhdeeda. I <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> about an hour. I got these chords going. Then I got this melody, it came pretty fast after that." [...] Inspiration came from the rhythm of [...] "Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring". In 2015, he explained: [...] "'California Girls' had that beat — it's called a shuffle beat — and that's definitely a Bach influence." ...|$|E

2500|$|At age 11, Parker {{took up the}} drums, {{just like}} his brother, and later was making [...] "excessively melodic music from {{about the age of}} 12 to 15", which was [...] "really weird and {{repetitive}} and almost genre-less", by recording his drumming and overdubbing guitar and other instruments in lo-fi experiments. Speaking about this Parker said [...] "I've always recorded music. When I was 12, I used to set up two tape machines and multi-track myself. First, I'd record a beat on the drums, then, I'd play that tape into another tape recorder while playing keyboard; then I'd take that tape and play bass guitar along with the drums and keyboard. I'd keep adding instruments. I <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> a long time until my dad bought me an 8-track, and then I continued recording music by myself, even if I was in other bands at the same time." [...] This hobby turned into an obsession for Parker who was [...] "just doing music all the time, I never did any homework, I'd just spend every night in the garage recording music." [...] Parker got his first eight-track recorder at age 16.|$|E
2500|$|While in prison, the poisoners {{agreed to}} name other poisoners {{so they would}} not undergo any torture. Their testimonies were fabricated. Then Françoise Filastre, a worker in the {{household}} of the Fontanges was arrested, she admitted to be a poisoner and abortionist, she entered the trial of Marie Angélique. When asked about what she knew about the duchess' strange death, Filastre panicked and admitted that Montespan hired her to perform the murder on Fontanges. [...] Montespan wished death on her young rival so she could regain {{the love of the}} king. Later Filastre said about her statements: [...] "All I said is false. I <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> me to be free of pain and torment. I say all this because I do not want to kill the guilty conscience of a lie." [...] however she was executed by burning in Paris after Marguerite Monvoisin accused her of a child sacrifice. Though many believed the Duchess was indeed poisoned by Madame de Montespan, the evidence by the witnesses whom later denied every statements from them as false made it impossible for the court to determine Montespan as the actual murderer.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} received media criticism {{due to her}} American accent {{upon her}} reintroduction in 2003. Johnson said, [...] "I knew that would happen because I'm the only character who speaks differently. I haven't taken any of that to heart." [...] However, when the accent was altered from American to British, this received criticism too with Ian Hyland from the Daily Mirror describing it as [...] "hilarious" [...] and branding the character [...] "Go Away Again Vicki". [...] He added, [...] "Presumably the producers decided the reason viewers found her so annoying was her whiny American voice. Try again, guys." [...] Upon her departure in 2004, Johnson was also critical about her character's alternating accent: [...] "When I took the job they weren't sure what accent they wanted Vicki to have and about a week before they told me it should be American. I <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> a few months {{and then one day}} out of the blue I arrived on set and they told me they wanted me to change to Cockney. It was the producer's decision. I was as stunned as everyone else - all the criticism was perfectly justified. It's probably the most stupid decision they could have made. People assumed I was slipping out of the accent - but it was nothing to do with me. I've taken a lot of stick. But it doesn't bother me because I know the truth." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Cameron first {{appeared}} in the pilot episode, she behaved with more human mannerisms, but these faded in subsequent episodes. It has been confirmed by Friedman that this behavioral change {{was the result of a}} conscious decision; however the explanations he has given of the logistics behind this decision have varied. At the Television Critics Association press tour, he stated that within the story, Cameron had been prepared for the events of the pilot. Once the characters [...] "jumped forward in time though, she was as adrift as everyone else". In an interview with IGN, Friedman stated that as he wrote the second episode, he became interested in exploring the [...] "calmer, odder part of" [...] Cameron, reflected in a scene in the pilot in which Cameron asks questions of John [...] "in a very programmed way". He continued to say that Cameron's behavior may appear inconsistent to a viewer, but that this inconsistency may be operative in the completion of her tasks. In any case, the character's robotic interactions with humans were manipulated for humor, but Friedman did express a wish to avoid [...] "cheap jokes" [...] in favor of more seriously exploring Cameron's existence as a cyborg. Summer Glau in an interview said about Cameron's changing behavior: [...] "We were experimenting with Cameron quite a bit, and we wanted her to be able to seem human. We wanted especially John to be fooled by her, so that he would let her into his life. And so in the pilot, I do act very human. And then as I go through the series, it appears that I’ve taken steps back and that I am acting more like a Terminator would. We <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> several different reasons, but I know for me it's fun because I get to take more time for her development, her human development. I think that it also is funny and I think once her cover was blown with the Connors, she kind of was able to drop that persona and become who she really is around them, if that answers the question." ...|$|E
