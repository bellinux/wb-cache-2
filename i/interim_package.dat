50|$|The SMODIM {{supports}} U.S. Army Homestation gunnery on digital range {{training system}} (DRTS), Digital Air Ground Integration Range (DAGIR), and Aviation Homestation <b>Interim</b> <b>Package</b> (AHIP) ranges. Upon proven success, the SMODIM {{has become a}} key component of the Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM) AHIP modular After Action Review capability. Beginning in September 2013, five AHIP AAR systems that use SMOTAR software suite are being fielded to Ft Knox, KY, Ft Drum, NY, Ft Stewart, GA, Ft Hood, TX, and Grafenwoehr Germany. The objective solution is full integration of ground/air manned platforms and Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) including Gray Eagle, Shadow, Raven, and Puma.|$|E
40|$|Labor {{will make}} a series of {{critical}} investments in services and programs that directly support women and children escaping family violence. Labor’s <b>interim</b> <b>package</b> will deliver more than $ 70 million over three years in targeted funding to ensure those suffering from family violence can access critical services.   Labor will invest $ 42. 9 million in frontline legal services to ensure women threatened by violence {{are not alone in}} going through the legal system. $ 4. 5 million will also be invested in Family Violence Prevention Legal Services (FVPLS) to support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women and their children experiencing family violence. Labor will provide an initial $ 15 million in grants to community organisations, local government or other appropriate providers that help people affected by family violence stay safe in their own homes and in their communities. Labor will invest $ 8. 4 million into research on mapping perpetrator interactions across family violence, law enforcement, justice, child protection and related systems...|$|E

40|$|The Pipe Overpack Container was {{designed}} to optimize shipments of high plutonium content transuranic waste from Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS) to Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). The container was approved {{for use in the}} TRUPACT-II shipping container by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in February 1997. The container optimizes shipments to WIPP by increasing the TRUPACT-II criticality limit from 325 fissile grams equivalent (FGE) to 2, 800 FGE and provides additional shielding for handling wastes with high americium- 241 (Am- 241) content. The container was subsequently evaluated and approved for storage of highly dispersible TRU wastes and residues at RFETS. Thermal evaluation of the container shows that the container will mitigate the impact of a worst case thermal event from reactive or potentially pyrophoric materials. These materials contain hazards postulated by the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board for <b>interim</b> storage. <b>Packaging</b> these reactive or potentially pyrophoric residues in the container without stabilizing the materials is under consideration at RFETS. The design, testing, and evaluations used in the approvals, and the current status of the container usage, will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|This {{software}} package implements {{a number of}} methods {{for the detection of}} safety signals in Clinical Trials based on groupings of adverse events by body-system or system organ class. The methods include an implementation of the Three-Level Hierarchical model for Clinical Trial Adverse Event Incidence Data of Berry and Berry (2004), an implementation of the same model without the Point Mass (Model 1 a from Xia et al (2011)), and extended Bayesian hierarchical methods based on system organ class or body-system groupings for <b>interim</b> analyses. The <b>package</b> also implements a number of methods for error control when testing multiple hypotheses, specifically control of the False Discovey Rate (FDR). The FDR control methods implemented are the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, the Double False Discovery Rate, the Group Benjamini-Hochberg and subset Benjamini-Hochberg methods. Also included are the Bonferroni correction and the unadjusted testing procedure...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to facilitate a better understanding of the fuel-cycle and nuclear material disposition issues associated with high-temperature gas reactors (HTGRs). This paper reviews the nuclear fuel cycles supporting early and present day gas reactors, and identifies challenges for the advanced fuel cycles and waste management systems supporting the next generation of HTGRs, including the Very High Temperature Reactor, which is under development in the Generation IV Program. The earliest gas-cooled reactors were the carbon dioxide (CO 2) -cooled reactors. Historical experience is available from over 1, 000 reactor-years of operation from 52 electricity-generating, CO 2 -cooled reactor plants that were placed in operation worldwide. Following the CO 2 reactor development, seven HTGR plants were built and operated. The HTGR came about from the combination of helium coolant and graphite moderator. Helium was used instead of air or CO 2 as the coolant. The helium gas has a significant technical base due to the experience gained in the United States from the 40 -MWe Peach Bottom and 330 -MWe Fort St. Vrain reactors designed by General Atomics. Germany also built and operated the 15 -MWe Arbeitsgemeinschaft Versuchsreaktor (AVR) and the 300 -MWe Thorium High-Temperature Reactor (THTR) power plants. The AVR, THTR, Peach Bottom and Fort St. Vrain all used fuel containing thorium in various forms (i. e., carbides, oxides, thorium particles) and mixtures with highly enriched uranium. The operational experience gained from these early gas reactors can be applied to the next generation of nuclear power systems. HTGR systems are being developed in South Africa, China, Japan, the United States, and Russia. Elements of the HTGR system evaluated included fuel demands on uranium ore mining and milling, conversion, enrichment services, and fuel fabrication; fuel management in-core; spent fuel characteristics affecting fuel recycling and refabrication, fuel handling, <b>interim</b> storage, <b>packaging,</b> transportation, waste forms, waste treatment, decontamination and decommissioning issues; and low-level waste (LLW) and high-level waste (HLW) disposal...|$|R
40|$|Aluminum clad {{research}} reactor {{spent nuclear fuel}} (SNF) is currently being consolidated in wet storage basins (pools). Approximately 20 metric tons (heavy metal) of aluminum-based spent nuclear fuel (Al-SNF) is being consolidated for treatment, <b>packaging,</b> <b>interim</b> storage, and preparation for ultimate disposal in a geologic repository. The storage and disposal of Al-SNF are subject to requirements that provide for safety and acceptable radionuclide release. The options studied for interim storage of SNF include wet storage and dry storage. Two options have also been studied to develop the technical basis for the qualification and repository disposal of aluminum spent fuel. The two options studied include Direct Disposal and Melt-Dilute treatment. The implementation of these options present relative benefits and challenges. Both the Direct Disposal and the Melt-Dilute treatment options have been developed and their technical viability assessed. Adaptation of the melt-dilute technology {{for the treatment of}} spent fuel offers the benefits of converting the spent fuel into a proliferation resistant form and/or significantly reducing the volume of the spent fuel. A Mobile Melt-Dilute system concept has emerged to realize these benefits and a prototype system developed. The application of the melt-dilute technology for the treatment of legacy nuclear materials has been evaluated and also offers the promise for the safe disposal of these materials...|$|R

Its aim was to implement a clear protocol for older persons to be discharged home safely from four acute sites using up to 10 hours interim home support. The HSE Change Model underpinned the implementation. In addition to the protocol a number of additional outcomes were delivered, e. g. referral criteria. The improved protocol was launched by e-mail to relevant line managers for dissemination to their staff and through some direct communication with key stakeholders. Following implementation, the project was evaluated using semi-structured interviews to determine the level of awareness of the protocol {{and the quality of the}} outcomes. The aim of the project was met. A streamlined protocol, covering leave periods; clear referral criteria; a multipurpose assessment form; and a new way of disseminating discharge information, were delivered. No trends relating to the allocation of interim home support at any specific times of the year were identified. The recommendations included continued use of the protocol, and further direct communication with front line staff at team meetings regarding the protocol to increase awareness and adherence to the protocol...|$|R
