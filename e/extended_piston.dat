40|$|Optical {{engines are}} used as {{research}} and development tools to study the combustion inside internal combustion engines. Conventional optical engines uses an <b>extended</b> <b>piston</b> {{in order to be}} able to observe the combustion chamber from below, through the piston. This <b>extended</b> <b>piston,</b> or Bowditch piston, limits the load and speed in which the engine can operate due to its geometrically weak design and considerable mass. This master thesis proposes a design for a new type of optical engine that has significantly higher mechanical performance compared to conventional optical engines. The new design may provide an engine speed increase of up to 100 %. Optical engines are often single cylinder internal combustion engines, fitted with transparent parts providing optical access to the combustion chamber. Using the optical access, various processes taking place in the combustion chamber may be studied optically which becomes more and more important in today's advanced engines, some of which are direct injected. The optical engine can be fitted with a transparent liner providing optical access from the side of the combustion chamber, together with the Bowditch piston providing access from below. These pistons are known for their high weight and low stiffness, frequently limiting engine speeds and cylinder pressures to low or moderate. For a standard optical engine with car engine specifications, maximum speeds can be around 2500 RPM. By summer 2014 Anders Dahl and Kristoffer Clasén came up with the idea of how to replace the Bowditch piston in an optical engine. By reconfiguring the conrod and crankshaft, optical access was achieved from beneath the piston rather than inside, making the piston shorter, lighter and therefore stronger. The reconfiguration also resulted in higher force absorption, which is a key feature since increasing engine speed drastically increases the piston acceleration and hence the reaction forces. The concept was consumed by Bohus Automotive AB and a master thesis in collaboration with the division of combustion at Chalmers was initiated. The work was divided in two parts; development and validation of the piston, and development of an engine comprising the piston. The aim of the piston validation was to determine a first estimate of the mechanical performance. A piston design was created using the CAD-software Inventor and an iterative approach. When the design had matured it was analysed by FEM with regard to stress, using the commercial FE-software Ansys Workbench Mechanical. Parallel to the piston an engine design was developed using the same software and iterative approach. The aim of the engine development was to establish a suitable engine layout comprising the piston concept. Without an engine, the piston has no use. Much of the engine was created using engineering intuition to be able to create a whole engine design within the project time, and the engine will need its own verification in the future. The piston analyses showed promising results, indicating a performance increase of up to 100 % in engine speed compared to the Bowditch design. Likewise, a successful engine with a compact design was established that fulfilled the demands on ease of use and accessibility. A few simplifications and assumptions have been implemented in the analyses, and more work is needed in the future to verify other components such as crankshaft and conrods. The transparent parts have been excluded from the analyses since they would inevitably limit the performance. Normally the transparent liner would be the first component to break. There is however a configuration option of the new engine that excludes the transparent liner which would allow much higher loads than usual...|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen {{has been}} largely {{proposed}} as a possible alternative fuel for internal combustion engines. Its wide flammability range allows higher engine efficiency with leaner operation than conventional fuels, for both reduced toxic emissions and no CO 2 gases. Independently, Homogenous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) also allows higher thermal efficiency and lower fuel consumption with reduced NOX emissions when compared to Spark-Ignition (SI) engine operation. For HCCI combustion, a mixture of air and fuel is supplied to the cylinder and autoignition occurs from compression; engine is operated throttle-less and load {{is controlled by the}} quality of the mixture, avoiding the large fluid-dynamic losses in the intake manifold of SI engines. HCCI can be induced and controlled by varying the mixture temperature, either by Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) or intake air pre-heating. A combination of HCCI combustion with hydrogen fuelling has great potential for virtually zero CO 2 and NOX emissions. Nevertheless, combustion on such a fast burning fuel with wide flammability limits and high octane number implies many disadvantages, such as control of backfiring and speed of autoignition and there is almost no literature on the subject, particularly in optical engines. Experiments were conducted in a single-cylinder research engine equipped with both Port Fuel Injection (PFI) and Direct Injection (DI) systems running at 1000 RPM. Optical access to in-cylinder phenomena was enabled through an <b>extended</b> <b>piston</b> and optical crown. Combustion images were acquired by a high-speed camera at 1 °or 2 °crank angle resolution for a series of engine cycles. Spark-ignition tests were initially carried out to benchmark the operation of the engine with hydrogen against gasoline. DI of hydrogen after intake valve closure was found to be preferable in order to overcome problems related to backfiring and air displacement from hydrogens low density. HCCI combustion of hydrogen was initially enabled by means of a pilot port injection of n-heptane preceding the main direct injection of hydrogen, along with intake air preheating. Sole hydrogen fuelling HCCI was finally achieved and made sustainable, even at the low compression ratio of the optical engine by means of closed-valve DI, in synergy with air-pre-heating and negative valve overlap to promote internal EGR. Various operating conditions were analysed, such as fuelling in the range of air excess ratio 1. 2 - 3. 0 and intake air temperatures of 200 - 400 °C. Finally, both single and double injections per cycle were compared to identify their effects on combustion development. Copyright © 2009 SAE International...|$|E

40|$|The thermal {{behaviour}} of a 2. 4 l {{direct injection}} diesel engine {{has been investigated}} to identify how the fuel consumption penalty associated with operation during warm–up can be minimised. A version of PROMETS (Programme for Modelling Engine Thermal Systems) was developed to support the investigations. The developments improved the representation of thermal-friction conditions in the oil circuit, <b>extended</b> the <b>piston</b> heat transfer sub-model {{to account for the}} effects of piston cooling jets and introduced a main bearing thermal-friction model to predict friction and oil film temperatures. Computational studies were complemented by an experimental investigation of the effectiveness of pre-heating the oil feed to the bearings. Results show that heat transfer from the oil film to the bearings shells and crankshaft journal reduces the benefit in friction savings. Other measures considered were exhaust gas heat recovery, repositioning of the oil main gallery within the block, thermal energy storage, reductions in engine thermal capacity and a novel split-EGR cooler able to cool the EGR gases and heat either the coolant or oil streams. All of the above measures were investigated in isolation, but where appropriate different measures were adopted in conjunction to achieve even greater fuel savings. During warm-up the energy available to raise fluid temperatures is small. As a result, over the New European Drive Cycle, thermal energy storage showed the greatest benefits. Given an available source of thermal energy which can be transferred to the oil over a chosen time, simulations indicate that a higher power input over a shorter period is most beneficial. This reflects the increased sensitivity of oil viscosity to temperature changes at colder temperatures which in turn means that the potential to reduce friction is highest in the first minutes after engine start up but drops rapidly hereafter. Results also show how the balance of energy transfers out of the oil changes as the engine warms up and point to the importance of oil interaction with components in the lower parts of the engine which have a large thermal capacity, such as elements supporting the main bearings, the crankshaft and the lower liner which limit the rate of temperature rise of the oil. A combination of supplementary heat introduction into the oil circuit from a thermal store and an elimination of heat losses from the oil to the lower parts of the engine resulted in a fuel consumption saving close to that achieved by starting the engine fully warm, which equates to around 6 % improvement.
