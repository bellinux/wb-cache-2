Bhaktavatsalam supported the Union Government's decision to introduce Hindi as compulsory language and rejected the demands to make Tamil {{the medium of}} instruction in colleges {{saying that it was}} [...] "not a practical proposition, not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> national integration, not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> higher education, and not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students themselves".

Following the completion of the first series, Holliday returned to the US. The character was voiced by English-Canadian actor Jeremy Wilkin for Thunderbirds Are Go, Series Two and Thunderbird 6.|$|E

In order to maintain Ecclestone's investment to deliver digital television, he proposed extending Ecclestone's rights for F1 coverage to 100 years from the initial 15, arguing that a deal of such length could not be anti-competition as it was effectively the same as an outright sale. The Commission agreed with his assessment and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> impartiality, Mosley removed himself from the negotiations, which eventually returned around $300 million (£150 million).|$|E

5|$|Psychiatry {{possesses}} {{an inherent}} capacity for abuse that {{is greater than}} {{in other areas of}} medicine. The diagnosis of mental disease can give the state license to detain persons against their will and insist upon therapy both <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> the detainee and in the broader interests of society. In addition, receiving a psychiatric diagnosis can in itself be regarded as oppressive. In a monolithic state, psychiatry can be used to bypass standard legal procedures for establishing guilt or innocence and allow political incarceration without the ordinary odium attaching to such political trials.|$|E

5|$|The British {{arrival in}} Jerusalem heralded a {{rational}} philosophy of infrastructure planning and development.

5|$|The High Court {{also held}} that the orders were neither irrational nor disproportionate. The order banning all WTBTS {{publications}} was reasonable {{as it would be}} administratively impossible to monitor any order other than a blanket ban. As for the deregistration order, the Court accepted that the Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to perform national service prejudiced national security, and was thus appropriately issued <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> public order. The Court noted that Singapore's administrative law does not recognize proportionality as a distinct ground of judicial review.|$|E
