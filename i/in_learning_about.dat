40|$|This study {{described}} {{the level of}} skills, and interests <b>in</b> <b>learning</b> more <b>about,</b> selected teaching activities and educational technologies among faculty with teaching appointments in the College of Agricultural, Food and Life Sciences at the University of Arkansas. As part of a United States Department of Agriculture grant, the study served as a needs assessmentfor designingfaculty development activities. Teaching faculty perceived that they had relatively high levels of skills in traditional classroom teaching areas such as lecture and discussion methods. However, they had high levels of interest <b>in</b> <b>learning</b> more <b>about</b> these skills. Their self-perceived levels of skills were low in such non-traditional areas as case studies, discovery learning, and peer observation, and they expressed little interest <b>in</b> <b>learning</b> more <b>about</b> these topics. There was little relationship between their level of skill and level of interest <b>in</b> <b>learning</b> more <b>about</b> teaching methods. These faculty rated their levels of skill in educational technologies lower than for the teaching methods. However, they expressedgenerally high levels of interest <b>in</b> <b>learning</b> more <b>about</b> the technologies. A substantial positive relationship was found between level of skill and interest <b>in</b> <b>learning</b> more <b>about</b> educational technologies...|$|R

25|$|Since {{the days}} of Grenfell and Hunt, the focus of {{attention}} at Oxyrhynchus has shifted. Modern archaeologists are less interested in finding the lost plays of Aeschylus, although some still dig in hope, and more <b>in</b> <b>learning</b> <b>about</b> the social, economic, and political life of the ancient world. This shift in emphasis had made Oxyrhynchus, if anything, even more important, for the very ordinariness of most of its preserved documents makes them most valuable for modern scholars of social history. Many works on Egyptian and Roman social and economic history and on the history of Christianity rely heavily on documents from Oxyrhynchus.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though he}} sought to {{distinguish}} observed facts from myths and popular errors and {{was known for his}} accurate depiction of many animals in Historiae animalium, he also included many fictional animals such as the Unicorn and the Basilisk, which he had only heard about from medieval bestiaries. But when Gessner doubted the accuracy of the opinions he relayed in his own writings, or the validity of the illustrations he included, he clearly said so. Besides any plant or animal's potential advantage to people, Gessner was interested <b>in</b> <b>learning</b> <b>about</b> them because of the moral lessons they could teach and the divine truths they might tell. He went into as much detail about some unreal animals as he did about real ones. Later in 1556 he also combined real and fictional creatures in his edition of the works of Claudius Aelianus.|$|E
25|$|The {{period of}} {{the second half of the}} colonial period, 1895 to 1945, is highly remarked as {{political}} stability and economic growth which accelerated modernization in Taiwan. The competition between the Japanese colonial Government-General and the native Taiwanese elite in the course of its modernization draw many young Taiwanese dream of being artists in a way of provoking improvement of their social status or cultivation of new knowledge which is more suitable to a modern society. Therefore, due to the trend of the campaign for modernization in Taiwan, many young native Taiwanese students went to study abroad, mostly in Japan from the late 1910s and some went to Paris in the 1930s. And indeed they became the pioneers in the era of the flourish cultural movement in Taiwan. It is irrefutable that literature had extraordinary importance in a socio-political and cultural context in the period from the 1920s to around the 1930s with the growing stimulation between writers and painters through shared interest <b>in</b> <b>learning</b> <b>about</b> modernization. The group of artists, painters including some major artists Chen Qingfen, Yang Shilong, Yang Sanlang and Liu Chi-hsiang, are characterized by westernized artistic expression and their own interpretation of time and place which represents a modern political and as well as cultural movement that were emerged by the landed-gentry who strongly resist against the Japanese colonial governors. One of the Japanese art critics recounts that the steady economic growth and great increase of public interest in art with numerous art exhibitions by single and group artists had attracted both Taiwanese and Taiwan-born Japanese artists return to Taiwan and share their works with audiences.|$|E

500|$|Ellen Page as Ariadne, a {{graduate}} student of architecture who is recruited to construct the various dreamscapes, which are described as mazes. The name Ariadne alludes to a princess of Greek myth, daughter of King Minos, who aided the hero Theseus by giving him a sword and a ball of string to help him navigate the labyrinth which was the prison of the Minotaur. Nolan said that Page was chosen for being a [...] "perfect combination of freshness and savvy and maturity beyond her years". Page said her character acts as a proxy to the audience, as [...] "she's just learning about these ideas and, in essence, assists the audience <b>in</b> <b>learning</b> <b>about</b> dream sharing". Evan Rachel Wood was Christopher Nolan's first choice to play Ariadne, but she turned it down. Before Ellen Page was offered and accepted the role, Nolan considered casting Emily Blunt, Rachel McAdams, Taylor Swift, Emma Roberts, Jessy Schram, and Carey Mulligan.|$|E
500|$|Although Alonso Álvarez de Pineda claimed Texas for Spain in 1519, {{the area}} was largely ignored by Spain until the late seventeenth century. In 1685, the Spanish learned that France had {{established}} a colony in the area between New Spain and Florida. Believing the French colony {{was a threat to}} Spanish mines and shipping routes, Spanish King Carlos II's Council of War recommended that [...] "Spain needed swift action 'to remove this thorn which has been thrust into the heart of America. The greater the delay the greater the difficulty of attainment.'" [...] Having no idea where to find the French colony, the Spanish launched tenexpeditionsboth land and seaover the next threeyears. While unable to fulfill their original goal of locating the French settlement, the expeditions did provide Spain {{a deeper understanding of the}} geography of the Gulf Coast region. The last expedition, in 1689, discovered a French deserter living in southern Texas with the Coahuiltecans. In April 1689, the Frenchman helped guide the Spanish, under Alonso de León, to Fort Saint Louis, which had been destroyed by Karankawa Indians. De León's expedition also met representatives of the Caddo people, who lived between the Trinity and the Red Rivers.
