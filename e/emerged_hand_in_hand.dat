40|$|Since {{the revolutionary}} {{mood of the}} 1960 s, patient-centered mental health care and a {{research}} emphasis on service users as experts by experience have <b>emerged</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> {{with a view of}} service users as consumers. What happens to knowledge derived from firsthand experience when mental health users become experts and actively choose care? What kind of perspective do service users pursue on psychological distress? These are important questions in a field where psychiatric expertise on mental illness is socially structured and constrained as an intrapersonal disturbance of the mind. We argue that experience experts have lost a coherent perspective on care and health. We illustrate this by rationally reconstructing how the interpersonal view of mental health first gained and then lost coherence between the conception of mental health, the practice of mental health care, and the user experience. Harry Stack Sullivan’s interpersonal theory was a paradigm case for such coherence. The inclusion of mental health consumers as ‘experts by experience’ in the mental health field took place at the cost of Sullivan’s coherent interpersonal theory. Service users who interact side by side with medical experts as experience experts are constrained by the evidence-based imperative and consumerism. Service users are caught up in a race among experts to gain knowledge about mental problems from a third-person perspective instead of from first-person experience. To make a contribution service users have more to gain from a research approach that appreciates that they are persons among persons rather than experts among experts...|$|E
40|$|The {{preservation}} of knowledge {{has been a}} human endeavour {{since the dawn of}} time. Using whatever resources possible, humans have recorded knowledge for the purpose of bequeathing it to the next generations. With each technological advance, {{it would appear that the}} resources available for recording knowledge have improved. Not only this, but with each advance, the accessibility and availability to this knowledge has been enhanced; and in our present times, the impact of technology has made it easier than ever before. As with education, the consequence of making knowledge more available and accessible is the creation of more knowledgeable individuals - individuals who live in a modern society, which has been termed the knowledge society. The potential of these knowledgeable individuals or knowledge workers as key assets in the production of services and goods is well recognised. Knowledge management has <b>emerged,</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand,</b> with this new breed of worker. As a tool, organisations are using knowledge management as means to preserve the knowledge of these workers. For different reasons, private sector organisations have been quicker to embrace knowledge management than their public sector counterparts. Ironically, governments support the concept of the knowledge society and all the benefits it promotes, yet, many of the agencies who operate on their behalf do not use knowledge management. This is, all the more, strange given that conducting business on behalf of the nation is knowledge intensive. Oberstown Boys School is one such agency. Operating in the domain of justice, its business is the detention of juvenile offenders. Given the nature of business, which is people focussed, the research of this project explores if a knowledge management initiative could be cultivated there. Through use of a knowledge audit the project will explore where the knowledge is in the organisation and explore how technology can help...|$|E

40|$|Review of A Hantle o Verse and Anither Hantle o Verse. The {{political}} regeneration of Scotland since devolution {{has been}} reflected {{in any number}} of cultural developments exploring {{what it means to be}} a 21 st Century Scot. Pride of place goes to the current Golden Age of Scottish drama, The National Theatre <b>emerging</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> with world class writers such as David Harrower, Andrew Greig and Gregory Burke. Prose too has found a certain buoyancy: Canongate publishes Booker winners and Barack Obama; Polygon's jewel is Alexander McCall Smith. Of course, this new-found self-assurance has concentrated the public mind on all things Scottish, including language. Perhaps the most complete expressions of this are Matthew Fitt's cyber-punk sci-fi novel "But'n'Ben A-Go-Go" and Suhaayl Saadi's Scots-Asian raga-rock epic "Psychoraag"...|$|R
40|$|As {{emerges from}} {{practical}} {{experience and the}} relevant literature, various specific and often unique elements characterise the values and behaviour of scientists and engineers. This group of personnel belongs to both firms and the scientific community making integration in a firm difficult. This often leads to conflict between personnel in R&D and personnel working in the other divisions of a firm (especially marketing and production). In order to facilitate the integration of scientific personnel, firms tend to adopt one of two very different approaches: the managerial integration model, typical of firms in an Anglo-Saxon culture, and the technological integration model, typical of firms in continental Europe (especially Germany). A third approach, which {{is very similar to}} technological integration, seems to be emerging from recent evolutions in R&D divisions. This approach is supported by a significant empirical base. It is <b>emerging</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> with the progressive spread of open innovation. The paper presents an analytic description of a new approach to managing scientists and engineers that has arisen from the development of the above trends concerning the evolution of R&D towards open innovation. The results of the study described in this paper are based on the analysis of four case studies of Italian multinational firms operating in the pharmaceutical, food, specialty chemical, and aerospace industrie...|$|R

6000|$|The {{real truth}} is that prices and wages and all the various {{payments}} from <b>hand</b> to <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> industrial society, are {{the outcome of a}} complex of competing forces that are not based upon justice but upon [...] "economic strength." [...] To elucidate this it is necessary to plunge into the jungle of pure economic theory. The way is arduous. There are no flowers upon the path. And out of this thicket, alas, no two people ever <b>emerge</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> concord. Yet it is a path that must be traversed. Let us take, then, as a beginning the very simplest case of the making of a price. It is the one which is sometimes called in books on economics the case of an unique monopoly. Suppose that I offer for sale the manuscript of the Pickwick Papers, or Shakespere's skull, or, for the matter of that, the skull of John Smith, what is the sum that I shall receive for it? It is the utmost that any one is willing to give for it. That is all one can say about it. There is no question here of cost or what I paid for the article or of anything else except the amount of the willingness to pay {{on the part of the}} highest bidder. It would be possible, indeed, for a bidder to take the article from me by force. But this we presume to be prevented by the law, and for this reason we referred above not to the physical strength, but to the [...] "economic strength" [...] of the parties to a bargain. By this is meant the relation that arises out of the condition of the supply and the demand, the willingness or eagerness, or the sheer necessity, of the buyers and the sellers. People may offer much because the thing to be acquired is an absolute necessity without which they perish; a drowning man would sell all that he had for a life belt. Or they may offer much through the sheer abundance of their other possessions. A millionaire might offer more for a life belt as a souvenir than a drowning man could pay for it to save his life.|$|R
40|$|To {{respect and}} protect {{linguistic}} {{and cultural diversity}} {{is one of the}} core principles of UNESCO and EU. The paper argues that cultural and linguistic diversity is a heritage of the communication means of the past. Relative isolation, both in informational terms as well as mobility led to parallel cultural developments within each information field which in turn lead to linguistic diversification as well as formation of the cultural heterogeneity. The rise of information age has considerably changed the nature and width of the information space for almost all ethnic communities. Therefore, <b>emerging</b> information technologies <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> with increasing economic possibilities for dissemination of information are inevitably directed towards the decrease of cultural and linguistic diversity. However, the maintenance of cultural and linguistic diversity depends also heavily various cultural and social psychological factors. The paper outlines the main social psychological factors influencing the ethnolinguistic vitality of a culture or ethnic group and reveals their structural relationships, for example the prestige of the culture, cultural distance and utilitarianism. These factors are organised into the equation cultural gravity which could be used to calculate the ethnolinguistic vitality of a certain culture or ethnic group. Based on this equation, suggestions are made how to enhance the ethnolinguistic vitality of lesse...|$|R
