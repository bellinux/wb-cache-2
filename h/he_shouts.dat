5|$|Phil's mother Peggy (Barbara Windsor) {{is accused}} by Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) of {{attempting}} to frame her for the murder. As Janine prepares to flee Walford, Peggy finds Roxy and Ronnie fighting. She tells the girls that she too was present the night Archie was killed, arriving to find him injured but alive, however left without calling for medical help. Outside, Bradley and Stacey are {{about to take a}} taxi to St Pancras railway station when Bradley realises he has forgotten their passports. He tells Stacey to wait and hurries back home to collect them, but is spotted by the police. A chase ensues, and Bradley climbs onto the roof of The Queen Victoria public house in an attempt to escape. <b>He</b> <b>shouts</b> for Stacey to run before losing his footing and falling from the roof. He dies from his injuries as a distressed Stacey reaches him and the residents look on in horror. Stacey is comforted by Max, and confesses that she is the one who killed Archie.|$|E
5|$|Jack {{receives}} {{a call from}} Hughes to say that Bradley {{is about to be}} arrested and urges Bradley to leave Walford as quickly as possible. Bradley and Stacey quickly pack their bags at home. Max Branning (Jake Wood) says an emotional goodbye to his son and Jack agrees to help them escape. They leave via the back door as Max delays the police at the front, and hide a few streets away. Jack also leaves by the back door but Marsden sees him and he is unable to meet Bradley and Stacey, who are nervously waiting. Bradley says they should go without Jack, but when they go to get a taxi to St Pancras railway station, Bradley realises he has left the passports at home and goes back to get them, leaving Stacey to wait. However, Stacey grows impatient and phones him. The police notice him when his phone rings, and in a bid to escape them, he runs up a fire escape and crawls across the roof of The Queen Victoria with an officer following him. <b>He</b> <b>shouts</b> at Stacey to run, but stumbles and falls backwards from the roof to the ground, dying instantly. Max and Stacey are devastated, and he pulls her away from the body. She tells him it is her fault, as Bradley did not kill Archie, she did. The following day, Marsden says the police will no longer be pursuing the investigation. Stacey then goes missing, and on the day of Bradley's funeral, Jack receives news that a court has found Bradley guilty of Archie's murder.|$|E
25|$|On {{the day of}} Callum's hanging, he {{asks his}} guard, Jack, to deliver a letter to Sephy personally. Callum is then led to the gallows. He fails to find Sephy in the crowd before the hood is put on. He then hears Sephy shouting, 'I love you'. <b>He</b> <b>shouts</b> back, 'I love you too'. Sephy watches the {{trapdoor}} open and sees Callum's limp, lifeless body hanging from the noose. She hears Callum shouting to her but is unsure if she heard the word 'too' so she cannot be sure that Callum heard her.|$|E

25|$|Dante and Virgil {{approach}} the Central Well, {{at the bottom}} of which lies the Ninth and final Circle of Hell. The classical and biblical Giants – who perhaps symbolize pride and other spiritual flaws lying behind acts of treachery – stand perpetual guard inside the well-pit, their legs embedded in the banks of the Ninth Circle while their upper halves rise above the rim and can be visible from the Malebolge. Dante initially mistakes them for great towers of a city. Among the Giants, Virgil identifies Nimrod (who tried to build the Tower of Babel; <b>he</b> <b>shouts</b> out the unintelligible Raphèl mai amècche zabì almi); Ephialtes (who with his brother Otus tried to storm Olympus during the Gigantomachy; he has his arms chained up) and Briareus (who Dante claimed to have challenged the Gods); and Tityos and Typhon, who insulted Jupiter. Also here is the Giant Antaeus, who did not join in the rebellion against the Olympian Gods and therefore is not chained. At Virgil's persuasion, Antaeus takes the Poets in his large palm and lowers them gently to the final level of Hell.|$|E
25|$|In {{the park}} on a Sunday some time later, George {{sketches}} a disgruntled Boatman to the disapproval of an observing Jules. Dot enters {{on the arm of}} Louis, a baker. Two chatting shopgirls, both named Celeste, notice Dot with a new man ("Gossip"). When Jules and Yvonne's daughter Louise attempts to pet the Boatman's dog, <b>he</b> <b>shouts</b> at her, then lashes out at George and storms off. George and Dot have a strained conversation as she works on the grammar book she is using to teach herself how to read and write. As Jules and Yvonne mock the unconventional nature of George's art, they discuss an initiative to have his work included in the next group show, which they both protest. George sketches two dogs while whimsically trying to imagine the world from their perspective, describing their relief to be free of their routines on Sunday ("The Day Off"). As the day goes on, George quietly sketches denizens of the park: The two Celestes try {{to attract the attention of}} a pair of Soldiers, fighting over which will get the more handsome of the two; the Nurse hides from the Old Lady and attempts to attract Franz's attention; Franz and his wife Frieda argue with Louise and each other; a pair of wealthy American tourists pass by, hating everything about Paris but the pastries, and plan to return home with a baker in tow; Jules returns to further lecture George on his shortcomings as an artist, receiving in response an invitation to see his new painting; the Boatman reappears to rebuke artists' condescending attitude. Dot sees George, but he slips away before she can speak to him, and in retaliation she describes her satisfying new life with Louis. She clearly misses and loves George, but Louis loves, respects and needs her in a way George cannot, and she has made her choice ("Everybody Loves Louis").|$|E
25|$|Leanne {{split up}} with Peter {{and started a}} new {{relationship}} with Nick. They book their wedding for Christmas Day but Leanne visits Peter after Peter confesses he wants her back. Leanne's sister, Eva Price (Catherine Tyldesley) revealed all at the wedding, causing Nick to leave Leanne. Nick confides in his sister-in-law, Kylie Platt (Paula Lane), and she reveals to him that Eva has been quietly causing trouble between him and Leanne. After a heart to heart, they give into temptation and sleep together. They agree {{that it was a}} mistake. Nick and Leanne reconcile and finally marry– just after Kylie announces she is pregnant. Nick encourages Kylie to have an abortion and she nearly goes through with it. David, who is desperate to start a family, discovers Kylie's pregnancy and stops her. David overhears Kylie talking about her one-night stand with Nick, and begins a vendetta on Nick and Leanne, which includes a poison pen letter to Leanne, stolen money, bad reviews on the internet and watering down the spirits at the Bistro. Nick and David went in the Bistro van and started arguing about the one-night stand with Kylie. David was desperate not to let Nick reveal all to Kylie and Leanne, as David feared losing Kylie if she found out what David had done to take revenge on Nick. David tried to get Nick to stop the van. In the struggle, David removes Nick's seatbelt and stops the van {{in the middle of the}} road, which results in the van being hit by a lorry, knocking them both unconscious. David wakes up shortly after with minor injuries, but Nick does not. Nick is left comatose and has a blood clot removed from his brain. While Nick is in his coma, Kylie gives birth to a baby girl, Lily. When Nick awakes from his coma, he suffers a panic attack when he sees David in front of him. Later, when Nick can talk more fluently, he blackmails David to get Lily a paternity test to see who the father is or he will tell the police and the Platt family how the accident was really caused. David does so, and with his friend Tina, he opens the results, revealing that David is the father of baby Lily. Nick later finds life frustrating when he cannot remember simple things. He is discharged from hospital with a walking stick, and goes to live with Leanne. On the day of Lily's christening everything is revealed. Leanne finds out about Nick and Kylie's one-night stand and the entire Platt clan discover that David caused the car accident. They disown David, but Nick is distraught when Leanne flees Weatherfield. She later comes back, but she splits up with Nick after <b>he</b> <b>shouts</b> at Simon and smacks her across the face at Christmas 2013. On the same day, Kylie goes on a drunken rampage and gets arrested. In January 2014, David and Kylie make up.|$|E

500|$|Jeff {{remarks in}} a scene that not liking the glee club {{does not make the}} group bullies, in {{reference}} to Glee creator Ryan Murphy's criticism of musicians who don't want their music on the show. When Mr. Rad reveals that he killed previous glee club members, <b>he</b> <b>shouts</b> [...] "Look, Kings of Leon!" [...] to distract the audience before escaping. Kings of Leon had previously clashed with Murphy over permission to use their songs on Glee.|$|E
500|$|When Oscar gets {{excited about}} {{drinking}} all {{the types of}} espresso, <b>he</b> <b>shouts</b> [...] "YOLO", a carpe diem-esque phrase popularized by the song [...] "The Motto" [...] by Canadian rapper Drake. Pam calls Jim [...] "Gumby with hair" [...] to calm down a nervous Darryl; this is {{a reference to the}} green clay humanoid character created and modeled by Art Clokey, who also created Davey and Goliath.

500|$|... "Domino" [...] {{had been}} {{recorded}} {{many times before}} its release. The first was in sessions from September to November 1968, just after Astral Weeks was recorded. Morrison rearranged [...] "Domino" [...] frequently from 1968 to 1970, notably recording rap and harmony versions. For its release it was arranged in a moderate 4/4 tempo and features rhythm guitar. Horn overdubs were later added to the recording. Morrison ad libs {{between the end of}} the chorus and the start of the verses, when <b>he</b> <b>shouts</b> the words [...] "Dig it!", as well as near the end with [...] "And the band... one more time!", which, according to biographer Peter Mills, helps bring out the theme of [...] "liveliness" [...] in both the song and the album as a whole. The song was considered by musicologist Brian Hinton as a tribute to pianist and singer-songwriter, Fats Domino. As with [...] "Domino", Morrison first recorded [...] "If I Ever Needed Someone" [...] in late 1968; it is one of many blues-influenced tracks on the album.|$|E

500|$|Hopkins and Stearne {{enter the}} village of Lavenham. Marshall, on a patrol to locate the King, learns they are there and quickly rides to the village {{with a group of}} his soldier friends. Hopkins, however, having earlier learned that Sara was in Lavenham, has set a trap to capture Marshall. Hopkins and Stearne frame Marshall and Sara as witches and take them to the castle to be interrogated. Marshall watches as needles are {{repeatedly}} jabbed into Sara's back, but he refuses to confess to witchcraft, instead vowing again to kill Hopkins. He breaks free from his bonds and stamps on Stearne's face, {{at the same time that}} his army comrades approach the castle dungeon. Marshall grabs an axe and repeatedly strikes Hopkins. The soldiers enter the room and are horrified to see what their friend has done. One of them puts the mutilated but still living Hopkins out of his misery by shooting him dead. Marshall's mind snaps and <b>he</b> <b>shouts,</b> [...] "You took him from me! You took him from me!" [...] Sara, also apparently on the brink of insanity, screams uncontrollably over and over again.|$|E
500|$|... "The Natural Order" [...] is one {{of several}} 30 Rock episodes to deal with race. In this episode, when Tracy leaves the first {{rehearsal}} accusing Liz of racism <b>he</b> <b>shouts</b> [...] "race card!" [...] and hands Liz a card with [...] "race card" [...] written on it ("playing the race card" [...] is an expression that means introducing the issue of race into an argument in order to gain the upper hand). During their disagreement Tracy also says that [...] "we have a black president now", referring to Barack Obama, but Liz says that he voted for Ralph Nader. According to J. Jeremy Wisnewski in [...] "Race At The Rock: Race Cards, White Myths, And Postracial America", this plotline is an example of people [...] "want to have race and do away with it too." [...] Tracy wants to be treated equally but also wants to continue behaving the way he is used to. Wisnewski says {{that by the end of}} the episode, Liz and Tracy, in reverting to [...] "the natural order", have come to understand the concept of equality; rather than forcing people [...] "to be equivalent to one another ... considering the different interests of people equally." ...|$|E
500|$|Belt {{begins to}} act irrationally then collapses {{screaming}} as he hears {{mention of the}} ghostlike entity from the astronauts. Paramedics are called to attend to him, and find him cowering under his desk whimpering and begging for help. Before Belt is taken away, he tells the agents that the shuttle will not survive reentry due to sabotage by 'the face', which had lived inside his body and possessed him since his time in orbit. At his urging, they alert the shuttle to change its trajectory and are just able to land it successfully. In the hospital, Belt continues to wrestle with the presence, telling Mulder he wasn't responsible but also couldn't stop it, as [...] "it came to me, it lives in me". Eventually, in a last wrestle with the re-possessing entity, <b>he</b> <b>shouts</b> [...] "no more" [...] as he leaps from the window to his death - experiencing a lengthy flashback to his last space mission as he falls. Mulder theorizes that, while Belt was compelled to sabotage the launches by the entity possessing him, {{he was also the}} one who sent Generoo the evidence of what was taking place. He lauds Belt's final sacrifice, stating that in the end he gave his life for the mission, as befits a true astronaut.|$|E

500|$|The video commences {{with a short}} {{segment of}} {{dramatic}} music. It then focuses on Cyrus, wearing a white tank top, jeans, boots and a black leather jacket, and her boyfriend leaving a movie theater and discussing the movie they saw. Suddenly, Cyrus' boyfriend begins to cough as a full moon emerges from behind the clouds. Cyrus is confused, then horrified as she watches him transform into a paparazzi, and runs away from him as <b>he</b> <b>shouts</b> [...] "Miley, come here! I just want a couple of shots!" [...] and tries to snap pictures of her. The music of [...] "Fly on the Wall" [...] begins as Cyrus runs into a parking garage and tries to hide behind a pillar and a black Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren. As soon as Cyrus tries {{to move away from}} the car, a mob of paparazzi begins to chase her with their cameras. Throughout much of the video, Cyrus runs and hides from the mob. Clips interspaced throughout the video feature her in a long silver shirt and jeans singing and dancing in front of the Mercedes. Eventually, Cyrus is cornered by the paparazzi. She is scared, but then surprised and perplexed when the mob unexpectedly begins to dance in a synchronized manner. Her boyfriend, appearing normal, then arrives in the Mercedes to rescue her.
