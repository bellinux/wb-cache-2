30|$|The GDOES {{detectable}} {{profile of}} nitrogen concentration {{related to the}} UPN process has about 12  µm average depth, equal to {{the thickness of the}} related γN layer illustrated in Fig.  4 a. While GDOES detectable profile of nitrogen concentration has about 25  µm depth for the DPN-treated kind as it is relatively near to the related γN layer with about 20  µm thickness. However, <b>diffusion</b> <b>depth</b> of nitrogen after the DPN process is higher than the UPN one. Anomalous diffusion dependent on furthered crystalline defects, necessary increase of the nitrogen concentration as well as the filling of trapping sites before the starting of fast diffusion are understandable reasons for increase of nitrogen <b>diffusion</b> <b>depth</b> [29]. The FESEM micrograph after the DR process reveals a grain-refined structure corresponding to a high density of grain boundaries acceptable to increase of diffusion because of a defective atomic environment. On the other hand, the high <b>diffusion</b> <b>depth</b> of nitrogen can mainly be related to the grain boundary diffusion. Due to the low amount of induced martensite (8  Vol%), martensite has a low effect on the increase of nitrogen diffusion. According to studies, for bulk material with grain size more than 10  µm, the area fraction of these grain boundaries is negligible [29]. Thus, the nitrogen diffusion along them is below the detection limit. In contrast, grain boundaries are everywhere in nanocrystalline or amorphous materials, leading to the diffusion enhancement by a factor of 1000 [29]. This change is achieved by pre-mechanical working that induces a high density of rapid diffusional paths. Therefore, conducting deep rolling prior to nitriding can increase the nitrogen concentration and its <b>diffusion</b> <b>depth</b> will be result in the increase of nitrided layer thickness.|$|E

The gradient of monomer generated during the recording process origins a motion of the monomer molecules from the dark to the bright zones. The high physical thickness of photopolymers required to use them as holographic memories implies an additional gradient of monomer in depth. The exposure time needed to record a single hologram is very short; nevertheless if many holograms are multiplexed an exposure time around 100 s or more is required. For this long period the importance of monomer <b>diffusion</b> in <b>depth</b> must be studied.

40|$|In {{this work}} we report {{a study of}} the induced changes in {{structure}} and corrosion behavior of martensitic stainless steels nitrided by plasma immersion ion implantation (PI 3) at different previous heat treatments. The samples were characterized by x-ray diffraction and glancing angle x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and potentiodynamic measurements. Depending on the proportion of retained austenite in the unimplanted material, different phase transformations are obtained at lower and intermediate temperatures of nitrogen implantation. At higher temperatures, the great mobility of the chromium yields CrN segregations like spots in random distribution, and the &# 0945;&# 8242;-martensite is degraded to&# 0945;-Fe (ferrite). The nitrided layer thickness follows a fairly linear relationship with the temperature and a parabolic law with the process time. The corrosion resistance depends strongly on chromium segregation from the martensitic matrix, {{as a result of the}} formation of CrN during the nitrogen implantation process and the formation of CrxC during the heat treatment process.

Recent research suggests that the mechanical properties of PZT can be enhanced by an exposure to a silicon carbide (SiC) nanopowder thermal treatment, potentially increasing production yield and decreasing production costs. In an effort to establish a SiC nanopowder thermal treatment/mechanical property enhancement relationship for PZT manufactured by SNL, bend bars with dimensions of 3 x 4 x 45 mm were thermally treated with SiC nanopowder at temperatures ranging from 650 °C to 900 °C for 2 hour intervals.

40|$|Advanced doping {{technologies}} are key {{for the continued}} scaling of semiconductor devices {{and the maintenance of}} device performance beyond the 14 nm technology node. Due to limitations of conventional ion-beam implantation with thin body and 3 D device geometries, techniques which allow precise control over dopant diffusion and concentration, in addition to excellent conformality on 3 D device surfaces, are required. Spin-on doping has shown promise as a conventional technique for doping new materials, particularly through application with other dopant methods, but may not be suitable for conformal doping of nanostructures. Additionally, residues remain after most spin-on-doping processes which are often difficult to remove. In-situ doping of nanostructures is especially common for bottom-up grown nanostructures but problems associated with concentration gradients and morphology changes are commonly experienced. Monolayer doping (MLD) has been shown to satisfy the requirements for extended defect-free, conformal and controllable doping on many materials ranging from traditional silicon and germanium devices to emerging replacement materials such as III-V compounds but challenges still remain, especially with regard to metrology and surface chemistry at such small feature sizes.

40|$|Aims: To derive {{analytic}} formulas for {{the efficacy}} of type-II corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL) based on coupled macroscopic kinetic equations {{with an emphasis on}} the role of oxygen. Study Design: modeling and analysis of type-II CXL Place and Duration of Study: Taipei, Taiwan, between Feb. and June 2017. Methodology: Coupled macroscopic kinetic equations are derived under the quasi-steady state condition. For type-I CXL, the riboflavin triplet state [RF 3] interacts directly with the stroma collagen substrate for crosslinking. For type-II process, [RF 3] interacts with the ground-state oxygen [O 2] to form a reactive oxygen singlet (ROS) which can relax to [O 2], or interact with the extracellular matrix for crosslinking. Results: Both type-I and type-II efficacy are nonlinear increasing function of the UV light dose (or fluence). Oxygen is required for type-II CXL, but not absolutely needed in type-I CXL. With the presence of oxygen external source, the steady-state type-II efficacy is a decreasing function of the UV intensity (for the same dose), same as that of type-I. Sufficient external oxygen supply, either pre-CXL or during CXL, will enhance the CXL overall efficacy. UV light in pulsing-mode may also improve the efficacy, but only when UV-off period is long enough for oxygen replenishment. Thin cornea (under the safety thickness criteria), low UV intensity (3 to 18 mW/cm 2), and epi-off CXL will achieve higher overall efficacy than that of thick corneas, or epi-on CXL under high intensity (> 18 mW/cm 2).

40|$|For 3 D stacked {{flip chip}} packages, through silicon vias (TSVs) are {{employed}} as vertical interconnection within the silicon die. The TSVs are usually plugged with Cu using an electro-plating process. To prevent Cu diffusion, improve the Cu adhesion and provide electrical insulation, the interfacial multilayers must be deposited on the TSV sidewall. In this paper, the Cu-to-Si diffusion in TSVs is investigated. The Cu diffusion behaviors {{are characterized by}} depth profiling analysis using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The roles of interfacial multilayers of TSVs are studied and compared as well. Regarding Cu-to-Si diffusion, the effects of Si surface roughness, insulation layer, barrier layer and the Cu source supply are investigated. Experimental {{results show that the}} SiO 2 layer not only serves for electrical insulation, but also helps to maintain the integrity of the TaN barrier layer and to prevent further diffusion of Cu into the silicon. From a surface roughness comparative study, the experimental results show that a rougher silicon surface may promote Cu <b>diffusion</b> <b>depth</b> and subsequently will impose a higher threat on the IC devices. Therefore, a smooth surface is preferred for the deposition of interfacial multilayers of the sidewall of TSVs. The TaN barrier layer in the interfacial multilayer structure on a smooth silicon substrate can effectively prevent Cu diffusion at an annealing temperature lower than 300 degrees C. However, when the annealing temperature is raised to 300 degrees C or above, the barrier layer tends to breakdown and the Cu element will surpass the TaN layer. It is also identified that the Cu layer thickness may affect the Cu <b>diffusion</b> <b>depth.</b> In general, a thicker Cu layer will promote the Cu <b>diffusion</b> <b>depth.</b> This effect reveals that the Cu diffusion in TSVs for 3 D packaging should be different from that in the Cu damascene structure for on-chip interconnection. Furthermore, Cu 3 Si is found when the barrier layer fails. To effectively control the copper diffusion in TSVs, the thickness of different layers in the interfacial multilayer structure should be optimized. An influential rank study of different layers by design of experiment (DOE) is presented in this paper. The results indicate that Si roughness is the most important impact factor. Therefore, a smaller Si roughness is preferred. Because the Si roughness is smaller for smaller TSVs by DRIE, the TSVs size should be balanced between the Cu diffusion and TSVs fabrication feasibility. Secondly, SiO 2 is more important than TaN within their factor levels. Due to the low Cost Of SiO 2, a thick SiO 2 layer should be adopted rather than a thick TaN layer. Furthermore, thicker Cu. film thickness will increase Cu <b>diffusion</b> <b>depth</b> and impose more threats to silicon devices...|$|E
