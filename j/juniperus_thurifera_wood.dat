40|$|Aim of study: Determining {{the main}} {{physical}} and mechanical properties of Spanish juniper wood from Soria (Spain) considering {{the effects of}} heartwood formation {{and the presence of}} defects and imperfections; and comparing the resulting characteristics with similar existing data for other regional softwood species of commercial interest. Area of study: Berlanga de Duero (Soria, Castilla y León), Spain. Material and Methods: Wood physico-mechanical performance was determined by Spanish UNE standards in order to provide proper comparisons to other regional softwood species. An individual tree representing average plot characteristics was selected in all eight 10 m radius circular plots that were established well-representing the heterogeneity of this woodland. The age of every tree was determined reading the number of growth rings at the base of each sampled tree. Every physico-mechanical property was assessed at least 4 times for every wood sample type (sapwood and heartwood, whether clear or with the presence of defects) of each tree. Two-way ANOVA was run to assess significant differences in the results. Post hoc all pairwise comparisons were performed using Tukey's test (p < 0. 05). Research highlights: Spanish juniper wood resulted harder than other regional commercial conifers, and showed semi-heavyweight heartwood and lightweight sapwood; whereas shrinkage figures remarked its great dimensional stability. The high presence of knots within heartwood made it even heavier, harder, and more resistant to compression parallel to grain. A commercial use of this rare precious wood may contribute to juniper forests preservation in the frame of forest sustainable management plans.

40|$|Objective. The aim of {{this work}} is to study and compare the {{antioxidant}} properties and phenolic contents of aqueous leaf extracts of <b>Juniperus</b> <b>thurifera,</b> <b>Juniperus</b> oxycedrus, Juniperus Phoenicea, and Tetraclinis articulata from Morocco. Methods. Antioxidant activities of the extracts were evaluated by 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical-scavenging ability, Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. Also the total phenolic and flavonoids contents of the extracts were determined spectrophotometrically. Results. All the extracts showed interesting antioxidant activities compared to the standard antioxidants (butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), quercetin, and Trolox). The aqueous extract of Juniperus oxycedrus showed the highest antioxidant activity as measured by DPPH, TEAC, and FRAP assays with IC 50 values of 17. 91 ± 0. 37 [*]μg/mL, 19. 80 ± 0. 55 [*]μg/mL, and 24. 23 ± 0. 07 [*]μg/mL, respectively.

40|$|Conservation {{opportunities}} in Spanish juniper <b>Juniperus</b> <b>thurifera</b> woodlands: {{the case of}} migratory thrushes Turdus spp. Spanish juniper <b>Juniperus</b> <b>thurifera</b> woodlands are the core habitat of several sites included in the Nature 2000 Network and the wintering ground of many European thrushes Turdus spp. These birds have amajor ecological role as seed dispersers and are increasingly {{taken into account in}} the design of strategies aimed to conserve or restore plant communities. Socio-economic changes in rural Spain have reduced traditional sheep grazing in juniper woodlands, which are now increasingly used for wood production. This has brought the opportunity to improve their carrying capacity for migratory thrushes. Here we explore the spatio-temporal patterning of fleshy cone production and the way birds track this resource. We also investigate whether fleshy cone availability constrains bird numbers. The results show sharp losses of cones during the ripening period, inter-site and inter-winter changes in cone production and the tracking of ripe cones by birds. Mean availability of ripe cones in poorly productive patches was insufficient to maintain thrushes in mid January and highly productive patches offered resources to maintain birds for around 12 days. This suggests an insufficiency of food in the woodlands to permit thrushes to complete the winter and to begin their return northward migration in March. These results are used to suggest some guidelines for improving the carrying capacity of these woodlands for migratory thrushes. ...|$|R

The site ranges in altitude from 1,645 m {{in the bed}} of the Oued Arheddou to 3,102 m at the summit of Jbel Tanrhourt. At its western end it includes the twin lakes of Isli and Tislit, near Imilchil.

The examination of phenetic diversity was based on the biometrical analysis of 17 populations using 12 morphological characters of cone and seed. The differences among populations were analysed using Student’s t test, analysis of discrimination, UPGMA agglomeration and hierarchical analysis of variance. The majority of morphological characters differentiated at a statistically significant level between populations and between J. thurifera subsp. thurifera and subsp. africana.

40|$|Aim of study: Assessing {{the effect}} of soil {{development}} on the stand structure of a Spanish juniper forest traditionally shaped by livestock browsing and wood extraction. Area of study : Berlanga de Duero (Soria, Castilla y León), Spain. Material and Methods : A stand inventory served to record stand structure. Tree age, height, DBH, basal area, and overbark volume were determined in each plot. Results were pooled considering two well-differentiated degrees of soil evolution. One-way ANOVAs (and Tukey’s test) and regressions between growth parameters were performed to assess significant differences between growth performances on both types of soils. Research highlights : Deeper soils yielded significant higher plant density and stand stock figures than stony shallower profiles despite the intense past livestock activity in the area; and single tree-size was also significantly greater. Non-significant differences were found for merchantable junipers age (≈ 120 - 160 years).

40|$|<b>Juniperus</b> <b>thurifera</b> L. is an {{important}} tree endemic to the western Mediterranean basin that {{it is able to}} grow in semi-arid climates. It nowadays exhibits a disjunct distribution pattern, occurring in North Africa, Spain, France and the Italian Alps. The Strait of Gibraltar has acted as an efficient barrier against gene flow between African and European populations, which are considered different subspecies by some authors. We aimed at describing the intraspecific genetic diversity of J. thurifera in populations from the Iberian Peninsula and Morocco and the phylogeographical relationships among these populations. The ploidy level of J. thurifera was examined and eleven nuclear microsatellites (nSSRs) developed for J. thurifera were assessed for genotyping this species. Six nSSRs were polymorphic and subsequently used to assess the genetic diversity and structure of the studied populations. Genotyping of the tetraploid J. thurifera using nuclear microsatellites supports the separation of Moroccan and Spanish populations into two genetically differentiated groups that correspond to the proposed subspecies africana and thurifera. High values of within population genetic diversity were found, that accounted for 90 % of the total genetic variance, while population structure was weak. The estimators of genetic diversity were higher in populations of Spain than in populations of Morocco pointing for a possible loss of genetic diversity during the spread of this species to Africa from Europe...|$|R

Seventy-seven compounds were identified, representing more than 97 % of the oils. The major components were Sabinene, α-pinene and terpinene- 4 -ol. The concentrations of the oil constituents: α-thujene, α-pinene, α-phellandrene, p-cymene, linalyl acetate, Δ-amorphene, germacrene D- 4 -ol, and 4 -epi-abietal were greater in the oil of the female tree than in the oil of the male tree.

A systematic correlation of tracheid anatomical features with climate has not been implemented in Mediterranean ecosystems, where climatic change is expected to be particularly intense. We measured ring width and cell number-in addition to intraring position, lumen size, and wall thickness of tracheids-in 10 <b>Juniperus</b> <b>thurifera</b> individuals from north-central Spain. We used this information to perform an exploratory analysis of how these parameters correlated with climatic variables in 1965 - 2004.

Earlywood and latewood tracheids differed in controlling factors, with earlywood tracheid size and wall thickness being positively related to rainfall during early summer and latewood tracheid size being positively related to August temperature. Tracheid anatomical variables improved our understanding of climate effects on tree growth and wood formation under harsh environmental conditions, as those experienced in continental Mediterranean climates, where limiting factors show multiple shifts across the year.

40|$|Question: Do abiotic {{constraints}} maintain monospecific woodlands of <b>Juniperus</b> <b>thurifera?</b> What is {{the role}} of biotic (livestock) versus abiotic (climate) drivers in the recruitment and growth of the different tree species? Location: Cabrejas range, Soria, north-central Spain, 1200 m altitude. Methods: Stand history was reconstructed using dendroecology and spatial pattern analysis, combined with historical data of livestock abundances and climatic records. Results: J. thurifera establishment occurred in two distinct pulses, with a tree component establishing in the late 1800 s to early 1900 s. Quercus ilex and Pinus sylvestris establishment was evident only from the late 1970 s onward. Recruitment events were related to reductions in livestock browsing. J. thurifera spatial structure was clumped and Q. ilex showed a short-scale aggregation to J. thurifera trees and saplings. Radial growth trends of J. thurifera saplings, Q. ilex and P. sylvestris were negatively related to livestock density. Summer drought limited the radial growth of all the study species, and P. sylvestris and Q. ilex grew faster than J. thurifera even after considering an age effect. Conclusions: The differences in radial growth patterns and recruitment pulses between species indicate that livestock browsing and not abiotic factors is the main factor controlling plant succession and structural development. In this process, J. thurifera acts as a nurse plant, facilitating the establishment of other tree species. Under the current low pressure from herbivores, formerly pure J. thurifera woodlands will change towards dense stands of mixed species composition...|$|R
