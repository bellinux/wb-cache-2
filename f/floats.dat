5|$|At about 13:15, an {{air attack}} by German Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters and Junkers Ju 88 bombers sank both destroyers within minutes. Wryneck {{launched}} her whaler, and each destroyer launched her three Carley <b>floats.</b> Survivors in the whaler set off east past Cape Maleas, towing two Carley <b>floats</b> and their occupants. In the evening the wind increased, causing the <b>floats</b> {{to strike the}} boat, so Waldron reluctantly cast them adrift.|$|E
5|$|The only {{abnormality}} {{found in}} all four engines was the vapour vent float in the fuel strainer chamber of the carburettors. The <b>floats</b> had been crushed by extreme fuel pressure. Inquiries {{were made to the}} engine manufacturer and other civil aviation authorities but none had prior experience of vapour vent <b>floats</b> collapsing. Tests on carburettors were also carried out in Australia by the Aeronautical Research Laboratories but without finding any suitable explanation. Whether the <b>floats</b> were crushed in flight or in the crash could not be determined, but even if it had occurred in flight it would not have affected operation of the engines.|$|E

5|$|A common {{plot device}} is referenced, where a {{shoulder}} angel (represents conscience) and a shoulder devil (representing temptation) appear near a character. This concept is spoofed in the episode, {{as both the}} devil and the angel suggest to Mackey that he should drink the beer. When Stan tells Kyle what he thinks a bris means, a dolly zoom is used, which is an unsettling filmmaking effect often used {{to show that a}} character is undergoing a major realization. The hallucinogenic effects of certain drugs are portrayed by different means. When inhaling cannabis, the alley that Mr. Mackey is in suddenly turns very colorful. After taking LSD, Mackey's head inflates like a giant balloon, and then literally detaches from his body, and <b>floats</b> away (the boys interact with Mackey by looking up at his head as it <b>floats</b> over them).|$|E

50|$|A {{woodworking}} <b>float,</b> {{also called}} a planemaker's <b>float,</b> is a tapered, flat, single cut file of two types: edge <b>float</b> and the flat sided <b>float</b> which are traditional woodworking tools generally used when making a wooden plane. The <b>float</b> {{is used to}} cut, flatten, and smooth (or <b>float)</b> key areas of wood by abrasion. Despite the name its woodworking uses go well beyond planemaking.|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, marine {{structures}} such as <b>floating</b> breakwaters, <b>floating</b> berths, <b>floating</b> platforms, etc. {{are used}} widely. <b>Floating</b> structures have some advantages such as more compatibility with marine environment, easier and faster transportation for temporary works and capability to install at any depth. The most commonly used type of <b>floating</b> breakwaters are rectangular ones as they have simple and rapid installation and also their deck can be used. For behavior study of <b>floating</b> breakwater, mostly structural response and transmission coefficient are considered. This article investigates effect of adding two thin boards vertically {{to the sides of}} rectangular <b>floating</b> breakwater to convert it to Π shaped <b>floating</b> breakwater and other geometric dimensions on the transmission coefficient of <b>floating</b> breakwaters. The results show that adding side boards and, mooring and fixing <b>floating</b> breakwater may reduce transmission coefficient considerably. In addition, dimensional aspects of can effect significantly on behavior of <b>floating</b> breakwater...|$|R

5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} also reduces silica {{which has}} {{to be removed from}} the pig iron. The silica is reacted with calcium oxide (burned limestone) and forms a slag which <b>floats</b> {{to the surface of the}} molten pig iron. The direct contact of flue gas with the iron causes contamination with sulfur if it is present in the fuel. Historically, to prevent contamination from sulfur, the best quality iron was produced with charcoal.|$|E

The mystic societies, which in essence are exclusive private clubs, also hold formal masquerade balls, usually by invitation only, and oriented to adults.|$|E

40|$|Very large <b>floating</b> {{structures}} (VLFS) {{have attracted}} the attention of architects, city planners, and engineers because they provide an exciting and environmentally friendly solution for land creation from the sea as opposed to the traditional land reclamation method.
