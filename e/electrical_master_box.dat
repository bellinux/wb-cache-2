5000|$|In October 1924, Gillham {{signed a}} {{contract}} with Columbia Records as an exclusive artist. When Columbia obtained rights to record using the new Western Electric recording system, Gillham was asked by Columbia to assist with the electric recording because of his use of microphones on radio.

(Brian Rust The Columbia Master Book Discography, Vol. III, p 19-20) Columbia began using the new electrical process with its other artists beginning on February 27, 1925.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{algorithm}} for the analytical evaluation of dimensionally regularized massless on-shell double box Feynman diagrams with arbitrary polynomials in numerators and general integer powers of propagators. Recurrence relations following from integration by parts are solved explicitly and any given double box diagram is {{expressed as a}} linear combination of two <b>master</b> double <b>boxes</b> and a family of simpler diagrams. The first <b>master</b> double <b>box</b> corresponds to all powers of the propagators equal to one and no numerators, and the second <b>master</b> double <b>box</b> differs from the first one by the second power of the middle propagator. By use of differential relations, the second <b>master</b> double <b>box</b> is expressed through the first one up to a similar linear combination of simpler double boxes so that the analytical evaluation of the first <b>master</b> double <b>box</b> provides explicit analytical results, in terms of polylogarithms a-t/s, up to a= 4, and generalized polylogarithms S_a,b(-t/s), with a= 1, 2 and b= 2, dependent on the Mandelstam variables s and t, for an arbitrary diagram under consideration.
