5|$|The {{idea for}} the game came from the producer, Masaru Oyamada, who wanted all Mana games to be playable on modern {{platforms}} for the series' 25th anniversary in 2016. Initially there was some argument at Square Enix about whether the remake {{should be done in}} 2D or 3D; they chose 3D, as it was thought to be easier to control on smartphones and because it {{could be used as a}} base for potential future Mana remakes. The game has received positive reviews, with reviewers giving particular praise to the visuals and the music, and some calling <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> Final Fantasy Adventure remake than the Game Boy Advance game Sword of Mana had been.|$|E
5|$|Too Much Too Soon was {{released}} by Mercury Records on May 10, 1974, to poor sales and only charted at number 167 on the Billboard 200. After a problem-ridden national tour, the New York Dolls were dropped by Mercury and disbanded a few years later. The album received positive reviews from most critics, some of whom felt Morton's production highlighted the group's raw sound and made <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> record than their first. Like their debut album, Too Much Too Soon {{became one of the}} most popular cult records in rock music and has since been viewed by music journalists as a precursor to punk rock.|$|E

25|$|Chicken {{stock is}} a liquid in which chicken bones and {{vegetables}} have been simmered {{for the purpose}} of serving as an ingredient in more complex dishes. Chicken stock is not usually served as is. Stock can be made with less palatable parts of the chicken, such as feet, necks or bones: the higher bone content in these parts contributes more gelatin to the liquid, making <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> base for sauces. Stock can be reboiled and reused as the basis for a new stock. Bouillon cubes or soup base are often used instead of chicken stock prepared from scratch.|$|E
25|$|In {{carnivorous}} plants, {{the leaf}} {{is not just}} used to photosynthesise, {{but also as a}} trap. Changing the leaf shape to make <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> trap generally makes it less efficient at photosynthesis. For example, pitchers have to be held upright, so that only their opercula directly intercept light. The plant also has to expend extra energy on non-photosynthetic structures like glands, hairs, glue and digestive enzymes. To produce such structures, the plant requires ATP and respires more of its biomass. Hence, a carnivorous plant will have both decreased photosynthesis and increased respiration, making the potential for growth small and the cost of carnivory high.|$|E
25|$|Further, Nathanson fed {{tobacco hornworm}} larvae with leaves sprayed with such psychoactive drugs as caffeine, {{formamidine}} pesticide didemethylchlordimeform (DDCDM), IBMX or theophylline. He observed a similar effect, namely inhibition of feeding followed by death. Nathanson concluded that caffeine and related methylxanthines could be natural pesticides developed by plants as protection against worms: Caffeine {{is found in}} many plant species, with high levels in seedlings that are still developing foliage, but are lacking mechanical protection; caffeine paralyzes and kills certain insects feeding upon the plant. High caffeine levels have also {{been found in the}} soil surrounding coffee bean seedlings. It is therefore understood that caffeine has a natural function, both as a natural pesticide and as an inhibitor of seed germination of other nearby coffee seedlings, thus giving <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> chance of survival.|$|E

However, Todd Helton, after striking out twice against Corbin {{early in the}} 2013 season, dubbed Corbin's slider [...] "the best I've ever seen."

500|$|From {{the late}} 1980s, R.E.M. was {{involved}} in the local politics of its hometown of Athens, Georgia. Buck explained to Sounds in 1987, [...] "Michael always says think local and act local—we have {{been doing a lot of}} stuff in our town to try and make <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> place." [...] The band often donated funds to local charities and to help renovate and preserve historic buildings in the town. R.E.M.'s political clout was credited with the narrow election of Athens mayor Gwen O'Looney twice in the 1990s.|$|E
500|$|After Australian {{federation}} in 1901, the {{upsurge in}} nationalism {{led to the}} search for an official national floral emblem. The New South Wales waratah was considered alongside the wattle Acacia pycnantha, and debate raged between proponents of the two flowers. The economist and botanist R. T. Baker proposed that the waratah's endemism to the Australian continent made <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> choice than the wattle, as well as the prominence of its flowers. He was nicknamed the [...] "Commander in Chief of the Waratah Armed Forces". The South Australian Evening News also supported the bid, but to no avail.|$|E

500|$|The A-10 has a {{cantilever}} low-wing monoplane wing {{with a wide}} chord. [...] The aircraft has superior maneuverability at low {{speeds and}} altitude because of its large wing area, low wing aspect ratio, and large ailerons. The wing also allows short takeoffs and landings, permitting operations from primitive forward airfields near front lines. The aircraft can loiter for extended periods and operate under [...] ceilings with [...] visibility.

500|$|Shortly {{after graduating}} high school, Stebbins {{enrolled}} in the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He initially majored in civil engineering, thinking <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> career option than biology, but became unhappy with the program. Struggling with poor performance and health issues related to congenital heart problems, he took a leave for year and a half. During his time in recuperation, {{he turned his attention}} back to natural history, and was persuaded to return to UCLA by Raymond Cowles, a biology professor there. Stebbins returned with enthusiasm despite the perceived lack of job security, remarking in 1985: [...] "I was cautious because of the Great Depression, but I was determined to pursue biology even if it meant standing on a corner with a tin cup." [...] He switched his major to zoology and graduated in 1940 with highest honors.|$|E
500|$|Reactions to the {{qualifying}} sessions mirrored {{those from}} two weeks before, with many commentators repeating their criticism {{over the new}} format. However, at a meeting between the FIA, Formula One Management (FOM) and the teams on race Sunday, no agreement was reached to revert to the old qualifying format, which was outright ruled out {{for the remainder of}} the season by the representatives of FIA and FOM. A new proposal was set before the teams, which would see every driver set two timed laps in every part of qualifying. Both times would than be added and the aggregate time would determine the grid positions. Reactions to the proposal were mixed. While Sebastian Vettel described it as [...] "a shit idea" [...] and Daniel Ricciardo said that he [...] "wouldn't be too keen on that", Jenson Button deemed <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> plan than the existing elimination format. On 7 April, the teams unanimously rejected the scheme, instead demanding a return to the format used between 2006 and 2015. The decision was finalised four days later.|$|E

500|$|Morley {{concludes that}} [...] "Anti-rockism was always violently pro-pop, largely because we {{original}} campaigning anti-rockists {{had been given}} such a tough time at school for liking [...] Bowie and [...] Bolan and not ELP and Led Zep." [...] Regarding the definition, music writer Ned Raggett noted: [...] "Every article, every discussion, anything which involves the word seems to get bogged down or get taken apart in ways which prevent there from being any consensus." [...] Accordingly, some people have used rockism as a polemical label to identify and critique a cluster of beliefs and assumptions in music criticism. Rockism is therefore not a connotatively neutral term, according to Raggett: [...] "You’re {{not going to find}} anyone arguing FOR [...] any time soon, or at least coming out and saying sobut that’s precisely because of the terms of the discourse." [...] Popmatters Robert Loss wrote that [...] "traditionalism" [...] describes the policing of the present with the past, making <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> word for [...] "rockism". Design critic and indie pop musician Nick Currie (aka Momus) compared rockism to the international art movement Stuckism, which holds that artists who do not paint or sculpt are not true artists.|$|E
500|$|As for the game's combat, Snider {{called it}} streamlined, {{but said that}} players {{who do not want}} to use the pause {{mechanic}} {{would not be able to}} appreciate the game, as the combat requires both patience and strategy. He liked the game's third-person view more than the top-down view, saying that being able to view the sky made environments feel more complicated, and praised the high difficulty of boss battles, which task players to manage their stamina carefully. His conclusion was that Origins [...] "feels like a real throwback to the good old days of PC role-playing epics." [...] VanOrd said that the combat system was easily recognizable for players who have played other RPGs developed by BioWare. He added that players can have a lot of fun switching between characters, and agreed that the game had created thrilling boss battles. He praised the choice to have health and stamina replenish immediately after battles, as it sped up combat pace and flow. Tan also commended the combat, finding <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> system than other BioWare RPGs, but disliked the fact that characters can't step into water. Juba praised the amount of space for players to experiment with new skills and abilities, adding that the required focus and attention make combat very satisfying.|$|E
500|$|In 1944 Arch Ward, the {{influential}} sports {{editor of the}} Chicago Tribune, proposed a new professional football league called the All-America Football Conference. The AAFC was to challenge the dominant National Football League once it began operations {{at the end of}} World War II, which had forced many professional teams to curtail activity, merge or go on hiatus as their players served in the U.S. military. It was a bold proposition, given the failure of three previous NFL competitors and the dominance of college football, which was more popular than the professional game at the time. Ward, who had gained fame and respect for starting all-star games for baseball and college football, lined up deep-pocketed owners for the new league's eight teams in hopes of giving <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> chance against the NFL. One of them was Arthur B. [...] "Mickey" [...] McBride, a Cleveland businessman who grew up in Chicago and knew Ward from his involvement in the newspaper business. McBride spent his early career as a circulation manager for the Cleveland News, and went into business for himself in the 1930s, buying [...] a pair of Cleveland taxi companies and running a wire service that supplied bookies with information about the results of horse races. He had connections to organized crime in Chicago and Cleveland arising from the wire service.|$|E
