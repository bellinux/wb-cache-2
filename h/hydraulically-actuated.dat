25|$|In {{a similar}} fashion to the fuselage, the wings were made up of three large units: centre section, port outer wing and {{starboard}} outer wing, which were in turn subdivided. Each section was built up around a main girder spar, leading edge section and trailing edge section. The wing made use of wingtip slots and <b>hydraulically-actuated</b> trailing edge flaps; both the flaps and ailerons incorporated stress-bearing D-spars.

50|$|The Avro York is a high-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane {{using an}} all-metal construction, bearing many similarities to the Lancaster {{from which it}} was derived. The wings use a two-spar structure, which internally housed seven fuel tanks contained 2,478 gallons between the spars. The outboard panels of the wings are tapered on both edges and are furnished with detachable tips. The wings feature all-metal <b>hydraulically-actuated</b> split trailing edge flaps and carry the four Rolls-Royce Merlin engines in four underslung nacelles attached to the front wing spar. Each engine drives a three-bladed constant-speed fully feathering metal propeller, manufactured by de Havilland Hydromatic. The fuselage is of a semi-monocoque construction complete with a flush-rivetted skin, and was built in five separate sections.|$|E
50|$|For the Mondial t, {{the engine}} and {{transmission}} were substantially reconfigured and their orientations rotated by ninety degrees to place the axes of both the engine crankshaft and the transmission input shafts parallel to the vehicle's longitudinal axis. The transmission and final-drive units form a combined transaxle arrangement fitted {{to the rear of}} the engine block, using a design originally derived from Ferrari's 312T Formula 1 car. Drive from the single-plate clutch enters the gearbox and is turned ninety degrees by bevel gears to the main transmission shafts which are aligned transverse to the vehicle. A parallel crownwheel with integral limited-slip action directs output torque to driveshafts with CV joints at each end. The clutch is <b>hydraulically-actuated,</b> and gear selection is via cable operation.|$|E
50|$|The E.28/39 was a low-wing monoplane, {{specifically}} {{developed to}} harness and trial the newly developed jet engine. It {{was described as}} possessing a slightly tubby appearance {{as a result of}} a round fuselage. Due to the elimination of any risk that would have been posed by conventional propeller tips striking the ground, the E.28/39 could be outfitted with an unusually short undercarriage for the era. It was outfitted with a retractable undercarriage, which was actuated via a hydraulic accumulator, which had a manually-operated hand-pump to serve as a backup. An emergency compressed air arrangement was also present. The flaps were also <b>hydraulically-actuated,</b> driven direct by the manual hand-pump. Unusually, the nosewheel was steerable by the rudder, which aided in ground maneuvering.|$|E

The plates can be conveniently fabricated using photo-etching and the design allows for a range of ratios between actuation pressure and tip opening displacement and force. The elastic gripping tips can be designed to provide sufficient compliance that their strain can be used to monitor and control the gripping force. An exemplar device has been fabricated and its behaviour characterised by a series of mechanical measurements of force and displacement. These measurements have been rationalised using a simple analytical model, backed up with finite element analysis to emphasise the design variables and scalability.

40|$|Fatigue {{testing was}} {{conducted}} on Carbon Experimental and Twist-Bend Experimental (CX- 100 and TX- 100) 9 -m wind turbine research blades. The CX- 100 blade was designed to investigate {{the use of a}} carbon spar cap to reduce weight and increase stiffness while being incorporated using conventional manufacturing techniques. The TX- 100 blade used carbon in the outboard portion of the skin to produce twist-bend coupling to passively alleviate aerodynamic loads. In the fatigue tests, the CX- 100 blade was loaded by a single hydraulic cylinder while the TX- 100 blade was loaded via a <b>hydraulically-actuated</b> resonant loading system called the Universal Resonant Exciter. The blades were outfitted with approximately 30 strain gages as well as displacement and load sensors. Both blades survived to cycle counts sufficient to demonstrate a 20 -year operational life. The CX- 100 blade failed at approximately 1. 6 million cycles because of a buckle and crack that formed and grew just outboard of max-chord. The TX- 100 blade failed because of a crack that grew from the termination point of the spar cap at the midspan of the blade. This paper covers the results of the fatigue tests...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} how to establish performance charts for selection of network parameters for effective utilization of a bilateral teleoperated manipulator working under a wireless communication channel. The {{goal is to}} construct a set of charts that help researchers and engineers to select appropriate parameters of wireless network setup for a known configuration of environment obstruction. To achieve this goal, a teleoperated setup comprising a master haptic device, a slave manipulator dynamic simulator, and a communication channel emulated using the NS 2 simulator, is first developed. Next, performance indices are defined to evaluate the quality of position tracking of the slave manipulator end-effector and force tracking of the master haptic. Three indices, chosen in this paper, are: the integral of squared position and force errors, the integral of absolute position and force error, and the amplitude of position and force overshoot. Extensive experiments on the developed setup are then conducted to study effects of time-varying packet loss {{on the performance of}} the teleoperated system. The largest mean packet loss, at which the system exhibits satisfactory tracking, is then quantified. This packet loss is used as an indicator to define regions representing the quality of tracking. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is validated by testing a fully-instrumented <b>hydraulically-actuated</b> system under various real wireless channel scenarios...|$|E

Dynamically substructured systems (DSS) {{play an important role}} in modern testing methods. DSS enables full-size critical components of a complete system to be tested physically in realtime, while the remaining parts of the system run in parallel as a real-time simulation. The performance of DSS testing is influenced by the synchronization of the physical and numerical substructures, which necessitates the design of a DSS controller. Since the testing signal is known and can be assumed to be a perfectly measured disturbance, the DSS control can be viewed as a regulation control problem with measured disturbance attenuation. A potential problem with DSS control arises from actuator saturation, which can be encountered in DSS transfer systems and can significantly influence the testing accuracy. This paper demonstrates the application of a novel robust disturbance rejection antiwindup (AW) technique, to cope with the actuator saturation problem in DSS. Implementation results from a <b>hydraulically-actuated</b> DSS test rig confirm the advantage of using this novel approach over some other existing AW approaches. Furthermore, some specific practical issues are discussed for the AW compensator design, such as the tuning of parameters...|$|E
40|$|A wind-tunnel {{investigation}} of tiltrotor whirl-flutter stability boundaries {{has been conducted}} on a 1 / 5 -size semispan tiltrotor model known as the Wing and Rotor Aeroelastic Test System (WRATS) in the NASA-Langley Transonic Dynamics Tunnel {{as part of a}} joint NASA/Army/Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc (BHTI) research program. The model was first developed by BHTI as part of the JVX (V- 22) research and development program in the 1980 's and was recently modified to incorporate a <b>hydraulically-actuated</b> swashplate control system for use in active controls research. The modifications have changed the model's pylon mass properties sufficiently to warrant testing to re-establish its baseline stability boundaries. A parametric {{investigation of}} the effect of rotor design variables on stability was also conducted. The model was tested in both the on-downstop and off-downstop configurations, at cruise flight and hover rotor rotational speeds,and in both air and heavy gas (R- 134 a) test mediums. Heavy gas testing was conducted to quantify Mach number compressibility effects on tiltrotor stability. Experimental baseline stability boundaries in air are presented with comparisons to results from parametric variations of rotor pitch-flap coupling and control system stiffness. Increasing the rotor pitch-flap coupling (delta 3 more negative) was found to have a destabilizing effect on stability, while a reduction in control system stiffness was found to have little effect on whirl-flutter stability. Results indicate that testing in R- 134 a, and thus matching full-scale tip Mach number, has a destabilizing effect, which demonstrates that whirl-flutter stability boundaries in air are unconservative...|$|E
40|$|Control {{design for}} {{flexible}} robots is a challenging problem. Part {{of the difficulty}} comes {{from a lack of}} controls-focused modeling tools. Practical flexible robots have several aspects that make them difficult to model: continuous elements, complicated actuators, multiple feedback loops, non-collocated sensors and actuators, and the ability to take on arbitrary three-dimensional poses. Even if existing techniques for modeling flexible structures could model the closed-loop response of a <b>hydraulically-actuated</b> flexible robot with a vibration suppression controller, how would such a model be used for control design? This work presents the development of a modeling approach that meets the needs of a controls engineer. The approach is based on the transfer matrix method (TMM). The TMM has been expanded in several ways to enable it to accurately model practical flexible robots. Quantitative agreement is shown between model and experiment for the interaction of a hydraulic actuator and a flexible structure {{as well as for the}} closed-loop response of a system with vibration suppression. Once the ability to model the closed-loop response of the system has been demonstrated, this work focuses on using the model for control design. Control design is facilitated by symbolic implementation of the TMM, which allows closed-form expressions for the closed-loop response of the system to be found without discretization. These closed-form expressions will be transcendental transfer functions for systems with continuous elements. These transfer functions can then be used in various optimization approaches for designing the closed-loop system response. Ph. D.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to evaluate a 1600 -pound, six-legged, gasoline- powered, self-contained, man-carrying, <b>hydraulically-actuated,</b> walking ma-chine built by Sutherland, Sproull and Associates. We were interested in the task of programming the control computer, the problems of operator control, and the performance of the vehicle. The walking machine presents two technical problems. The first is how best to permit the operator to control it. A control stick and two foot pedals provide operator inputs, and we connected them in various ways to give the driver control of the machine's path, direction, and speed. In addition, we experimented with different algorithms to select the particular uses of particular legs. The second technical problem posed by the walking machine comes about be-cause of the topology of the hydraulic circuits that actuate it. Rather than using a separate servomechanism for each joint, the hydraulic circuits of this machine permit actuators from several of its joints to be made a part of a single hydraulic circuit. Parallel connections of actuators permit leg to share load equally; series connections force them to move synchronously. By setting valves to establish series and parallel hydraulic circuits, the control computer can obtain coordinated joint motions without further direct action. We learned {{a great deal about the}} strengths and weaknesses of this approach to leg coordination. -. [...] -Our general methodology was direct experimentation. The machine was used for experiments with walking from October 1982 until August 1983. We operated the machine in a parking lot adjacent to the laboratory that housed it. Three operators became reasonably adept at controlling it. We made two video tapes of its operation and had numerous demonstrations for government, industry, and academic visitors.
