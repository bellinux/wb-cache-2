25|$|He {{claimed that}} it was not {{entitled}} to the deference the Court accorded agencies of the executive branch. It was not, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>a</b> reasonable interpretation of the National Banking Act and thus, per the rule it had established in the 1984 Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. case, the Court should review it afresh and rule on whether it was the best interpretation of the statute.|$|E
25|$|On 5 December 1988 (16 {{days prior}} to the attack), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a {{security}} bulletin saying that, on that day, {{a man with an}} Arabic accent had telephoned the US Embassy in Helsinki, Finland, and told them that a Pan Am flight from Frankfurt to the United States would be blown up within the next two weeks by someone associated with the Abu Nidal Organization; <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>a</b> Finnish woman would carry the bomb on board as an unwitting courier.|$|E
25|$|On April 30, 1988, {{during a}} home {{game against the}} New York Mets, with two out {{in the top of}} the ninth inning, umpire Dave Pallone made a late call at first base that allowed what would be the {{eventual}} game-winning run. Rose argued the call vehemently and forcefully pushed the umpire. Rose, who only appeared to contact Pallone with his shoulder and forearm, told reporters after the game he shoved Pallone only after the umpire made contact with him; <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>a</b> scratch near his left eye proved Pallone touched him first. In his 1990 book, Pallone claimed that scratch was self-inflicted in the clubhouse after the ejection. Cincinnati fans showered the field with objects including radios and cigarette lighters.|$|E

[...] "I concentrated on the basement, believing the girl might have fallen down the stairs," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>A</b> volunteer fireman, John Reeves, also searched the first-floor bedroom but not the closet.

500|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, many Scout {{executives}} were skeptical {{of what they}} called [...] "secret camp fraternities".

Goodman argued against the motion: [...] "Using the Scout ideals as our great objective", <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>a</b> camp activity that will [...] "further the advancement of those ideals" [...] should not be suppressed.

500|$|Upon {{his return}} to Australia, Thorpe withdrew from the {{selection}} trials for the 2007 World Championships and announced his retirement on 21 November 2006. Thorpe {{said that he had}} been contemplating retirement for some time, but was afraid of the future because swimming had given him a [...] "safety blanket". Thorpe stated that he retired despite reaching higher levels of fitness, noting [...] "As I got fit, physically fit, my mind also got fit". <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>a</b> clear mind allowed him to reach his decision. He was close to tears when thanking the Australian public, but declared that his retirement was a [...] "joyous" [...] occasion of celebration.|$|E

500|$|Before Yao's {{first meeting}} with Shaquille O'Neal on January 17, 2003, O'Neal said, [...] "Tell Yao Ming, Ching chong-yang-wah-ah-soh", {{prompting}} accusations of racism. O'Neal denied that his comments were racist, {{and said he was}} only joking. Yao also said he believed O'Neal was joking, but <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>a</b> lot of Asians would not see the humor. In the game, Yao scored the Rockets' first six points of the game and blocked O'Neal twice in the opening minutes as well as altering two other shots by O'neal, all 4 of those attempts coming right at the rim, and made a game-sealing dunk with 10seconds left in overtime. Yao finished with 10points, 10rebounds, and 6blocks; O'Neal recorded 31points, 13rebounds, and 0blocks. O'Neal later admitted that he regretted how he hazed Yao early in his career.|$|E

500|$|Several famous Americans made guest {{appearances}} in the episode. Actor Michael Keaton guest starred as Jack Crowley, while stand-up comedian Robert Schimmel appeared as a prisoner in Marge's art class that wants to smell her clothes. Actor Charles Napier voiced the prison warden that commentates the rodeo at the prison and later grants Jack his parole. Comedy writer and actor Bruce Vilanch guest starred in the episode as himself at the unveiling of Jack's mural painting. There, Principal Skinner jokes to the audience that [...] "when Superintendent Chalmers suggested a school mural, I almost thought <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>a</b> 'school Muriel'," [...] referencing Chalmers' sister Muriel. When no one laughs at his joke and the audience is dead silent, Skinner sarcastically says [...] "Well, thank you, Bruce Vilanch," [...] to which Vilanch replies [...] "Whoopi would've made it work." [...] This is {{a reference to the}} fact that Vilanch has written comedy material for actress Whoopi Goldberg.|$|E
500|$|Some {{have been}} linked to his caustic {{criticism}} of George W. Bush's administration. [...] For instance, his frustration over the slow federal response to Hurricane Katrina led him to compare, at a Congressional Black Caucus town meeting in September 2005, Bush to Bull Connor, a 1960s symbol of white opposition to the civil rights movement, stating: [...] "George Bush is our Bull Connor." [...] <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>a</b> few days later that both figures had become focal points for American blacks to rally against. His first remark led to a public exchange with Vice President Dick Cheney, who said, [...] "I'm frankly surprised at his comments. It almost struck me â they were so out of line, it almost struck me that there was some â Charlie was having some problem. Charlie is losing it, I guess."

500|$|When Nixon died in 1994, {{his daughters}} invited Agnew {{to attend the}} funeral at Yorba Linda, California. At first he refused, still bitter over how he had been treated by the White House in his final days as vice president; {{over the years he}} had {{rejected}} various overtures from the Nixon camp to mend fences. He was persuaded to accept the invitation, and received a warm welcome there from his former colleagues. [...] "I decided after twenty years of resentment to put it aside", <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>A</b> year later, Agnew appeared at the Capitol in Washington for the dedication of a bust of him, to be placed with those of other vice presidents. Agnew commented: [...] "I am not blind or deaf to the fact that some people feel that ... the Senate by commissioning this bust is giving me an honor I don't deserve. I would remind these people that ... this ceremony {{has less to do with}} Spiro Agnew than with the office I held".|$|E
500|$|In 632, {{at the end}} of {{the tenth}} year after {{migration}} to Medina, Muhammad completed his first true Islamic pilgrimage, setting precedence for the annual Great Pilgrimage, known as Hajj. [...] On the 9th of Dhu al-Hijjah Muhammad delivered his Farewell Sermon, at Mount Arafat east of Mecca. In this sermon, Muhammad advised his followers not to follow certain pre-Islamic customs. For instance, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>a</b> white has no superiority over a black, nor a black has any superiority over a white except by piety and good action. He abolished old blood feuds and disputes based on the former tribal system and asked for old pledges to be returned as implications of the creation of the new Islamic community. Commenting on the vulnerability of women in his society, Muhammad asked his male followers to [...] "be good to women, for they are powerless captives (awan) in your households. You took them in God's trust, and legitimated your sexual relations with the Word of God, so come to your senses people, and hear my words ..." [...] He told them that they were entitled to discipline their wives but should do so with kindness. He addressed the issue of inheritance by forbidding false claims of paternity or of a client relationship to the deceased and forbade his followers to leave their wealth to a testamentary heir. He also upheld the sacredness of four lunar months in each year. According to Sunni tafsir, the following Quranic verse was delivered during this event: [...] "Today I have perfected your religion, and completed my favours for you and chosen Islam as a religion for you" [...] (Quran [...] ). According to Shia tafsir, it refers to the appointment of Ali ibn Abi Talib at the pond of Khumm as Muhammad's successor, this occurring a few days later when Muslims were returning from Mecca to Medina.|$|E
