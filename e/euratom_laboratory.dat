40|$|In June 2000, hence {{eight years}} after the European Commission had taken the {{decision}} to build safeguards on-site laboratories {{at the site of}} the two main commercial European reprocessing plants, the second <b>EURATOM</b> <b>laboratory,</b> the ¿Laboratoire Sur Site¿ (LSS) located at the site of COGEMA (Areva group) at Cap de La Hague was inaugurated [1, 2]. The Institute for Transuranium Elements (ITU) had installed and commissioned the analytical facilities and has performed the safeguards analyses taken in the plant. This work is carried out in the framework of EURATOM safeguards under the responsibility of the Directorate General for Transport and Energy (DG TREN). This paper summarizes five years of operational experience gained in the LSS. This description includes organizational aspects and technical features, covering aspects of laboratory management, sample handling, measurement quality and reference materials. The observations made during this period and the changes introduced will be discussed. We will review the application of measurement techniques: on the one hand the radiometric instruments which are automated to be able to measure the whole throughput of samples and on the other hand the Isotope Dilution Mass Spectrometry (IDMS). Their different roles and the performances reached will be highlighted. Furthermore, the different analytical problems ITU analysts had to face and the improvements implemented to reach the challenging target: performing accurate analysis for safeguards purposes on a timeliness basis. Finally, we will discuss logistical questions, aspects of interfacing with the operator and with the inspectors and the efficient use of resources. JRC. E. 5 -Nuclear chemistr...|$|E
40|$|Euratom {{safeguards}} was {{the first}} international safeguards organisation having to cope with nuclear material safeguards in huge industrial scale reprocessing facilities. The four plants in the UK (Magnox, Thorp) and France (UP 2, UP 3) were built in two sites. Thorough analysis concluded that sampling is needed; the transport of the samples to a central <b>Euratom</b> <b>laboratory</b> should be avoided. It was decided to establish laboratories {{on the site of}} Sellafield and La Hague. These laboratories were opened about ten years ago and have been working continuously. They are staffed by experts of the Institute for Transuranium Elements, JRC-ITU, at Karlsruhe. ITU staff is present on-site for more than 40 weeks per year, ensuring a continuous flow of samples and of results. The laboratories receive samples from all the plants on the respective sites, with input solution, plutonium products (including mixed oxides) and inventory samples being the most important type of material. The criteria for selection of the measurement methods for these samples are based on a combination of highest possible accuracy and a minimum of resource consumption. The data can be used for direct comparison with the operator¿s results and they allow an evaluation of the material flows and material balance in a timely manner. The paper will give an overview of 10 years of operation of the laboratories. Emphasis will be on analytical techniques, measurement uncertainties, and on the renovation of measurement equipment, which is becoming a serious issue after ten years of operation. The first major equipment replacement carried out now is the exchange of a mass spectrometer at the Sellafield laboratory. The safeguards impact will be discussed, and the lessons learned and the way forward will be presented. JRC. E. 7 -Nuclear Safeguards and Forensic...|$|E
40|$|Quality Control (QC) {{is a set}} of procedures, {{including}} technical activities, {{to ensure}} that a final product or a performed service adheres to a defined set of quality criteria and meets the customer requirements. Quality assurance (QA) is defined as a systematic process to check whether a service/product under development is meeting specific requirements before the product or service is completed. The non-proliferation treaty (NPT) comprises a verification mechanism: nuclear safeguards. Safeguards aims at the verification of the non-diversion of fissile material from its intended and declared (peaceful) use. Therefore a reliable nuclear material accountancy system has to be established by the plant operator. This accountancy is subject to independent verification by the safeguards authorities. Measurement of samples (for their content in U or Pu and the respective isotopic composition) taken by inspectors remains the backbone of any verification system. Environmental sampling is a supplementary safeguards tool aiming at verifying the correctness and completeness of a state¿s declarations. The system of measurements applied in nuclear safeguards is expected to conform to the latest standards. This technical sheet lists the different aspects of QA and QC in analytical measurements, explains the fundamental role of reference materials, quality control samples, uncertainty of measurement results and interlaboratory comparisons in view of measurements of the nuclear fuel cycle materials. The systematic concept for analytical quality control in the <b>Euratom</b> on-site <b>laboratories</b> is given as an example. JRC. D. 4 -Isotope measurement...|$|R
40|$|Reliable {{measurements}} {{are needed for}} the verification measures of States’ declarations of their nuclear activities in line with international agreements and the <b>EURATOM</b> Treaty. <b>Laboratories</b> carrying out measurements of nuclear material need to follow stringent quality control concepts and are required to demonstrate their measurement capabilities on a regular and timely basis to legal and Safeguards authorities. This includes participation in interlaboratory comparisons (ILCs). In {{the frame of the}} Regular European Interlaboratory Measurement Evaluation Programme (REIMEP) a new ILC (REIMEP- 17) was jointly organized by the EC-Joint Research Centre-Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (JRC-IRMM) and EC-Joint Research Centre-Institute for Transuranium Elements (JRC-ITU) for EURATOM and IAEA safeguards laboratories, nuclear plant operators and nuclear material laboratories. The focus in REIMEP- 17 was on measurements of the uranium and plutonium amount contents, and isotope amount ratios in synthetic input solutions. Participants received two test samples, REIMEP- 17 A and REIMEP 17 B, with different uranium and plutonium amount contents. Laboratories were requested to report the results with associated uncertainties applying their standard measurement procedures, and had the possibility to benchmark those results against the independent assigned (reference) values and the International Target Values for Measurement Uncertainties in Safeguarding Nuclear Materials (ITV 2010). It can be concluded that the participants in REIMEP- 17 performed well for the measurements of uranium and plutonium amount content in compliance with the respective ITV 2010. In particular, the measurement performance for the isotope amount ratios was very satisfactory for both REIMEP- 17 test samples. This confirms the measurement capabilities of laboratories in the field of nuclear material analysis and demonstrates that the stringent ITV 2010 are achievable target values under state-of-practice conditions. On the other hand, the spread of results for the minor uranium isotope amount ratios was larger. Moreover, for some of the measurands, differences in the measurement uncertainty estimations provided by laboratories were observed even when using the same instrumental technique. A summary of the participant results is presented and discussed in this paper. JRC. D. 4 -Standards for Nuclear Safety, Security and Safeguard...|$|R
