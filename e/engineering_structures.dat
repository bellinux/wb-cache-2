25|$|Seismic {{design is}} based on {{authorized}} engineering procedures, principles and criteria meant to design or retrofit structures subject to earthquake exposure. Those criteria are only consistent with the contemporary state of the knowledge about earthquake <b>engineering</b> <b>structures.</b> Therefore, a building design which exactly follows seismic code regulations does not guarantee safety against collapse or serious damage.|$|E
25|$|The Roman Architectural Revolution, {{also known}} as the Concrete Revolution, was the {{widespread}} use in Roman architecture of the previously little-used architectural forms of the arch, vault, and dome. For the first time in history, their potential was fully exploited in the construction {{of a wide range of}} civil <b>engineering</b> <b>structures,</b> public buildings, and military facilities. These included amphitheatres, aqueducts, baths, bridges, circuses, dams, domes, harbours, and temples.|$|E
25|$|Ground rupture is {{a visible}} {{breaking}} and {{displacement of the}} Earth's surface along the trace of the fault, which may be {{of the order of}} several meters in the case of major earthquakes. Ground rupture is a major risk for large <b>engineering</b> <b>structures</b> such as dams, bridges and nuclear power stations and requires careful mapping of existing faults to identify any which are likely to break the ground surface within the life of the structure.|$|E

25|$|The work is {{important}} for its descriptions of the many different machines used for <b>engineering</b> <b>structures</b> such as hoists, cranes and pulleys, as well as war machines such as catapults, ballistae, and siege engines. As a practising engineer, Vitruvius must be speaking from personal experience rather than simply describing the works of others. He also describes the construction of sundials and water clocks, {{and the use of}} an aeolipile (the first steam engine) as an experiment to demonstrate the nature of atmospheric air movements (wind).|$|E
25|$|When {{protecting}} the coastline {{it is important}} to understand the how the sedimentary budget can be affected when implementing appropriate coastal protecting techniques. Often management plans for coastal erosion have seen the use of ‘hard’ <b>engineering</b> <b>structures</b> as a means of {{protecting the}} coastline from recession. In particular groynes which are used to trap the longshore drift of sediment that often deprives a beach. Groynes have the ability to change the coast's sediment budget, accreting up drift beaches but at the same time starving down drift beaches. This management approach is not used so much these days, with modern knowledge of coastal dynamics promoting the use of ‘soft’, natural approaches such as nourishment and preservation of natural systems such as dunes.|$|E
500|$|The storm, an extratropical cyclone, {{originated}} as {{the convergence}} of two major storm fronts, fueled by the lakes' relatively warm waters—a seasonal process called a [...] "November gale". It produced 90mph (145km/h) wind gusts, waves over 35feet (11m) high, and whiteout snowsqualls. Analysis of the storm {{and its impact on}} humans, <b>engineering</b> <b>structures,</b> and the landscape led to better forecasting and faster responses to storm warnings, stronger construction (especially of marine vessels), and improved preparedness.|$|E

Based on the strain modal analysis theory, it expounds the connection among displacement mode, strain mode and curvature mode, with a heavy rubber as the material to make a cantilever beam, and establishing the different damage conditions of the cantilever beam, studying about dynamic structural damage identification under the incentive, which provides the theoretical basis and technical support for the research on damage detection of large <b>engineering</b> <b>structure...</b>|$|R

2500|$|In 1823–1839 a {{waterway}} {{designed by}} General Ignacy Prądzyński, French General and engineer Jan Chrzciciel de Grandville Malletski and General Jan Paweł Lelewel was constructed, including buildings and hydraulic <b>engineering</b> <b>structures,</b> intended to bypass Prussian territory and link {{the center of}} the Kingdom of Poland with the Baltic seaport of Ventspils (...) [...] The building of the final [...] "windawski" [...] section of the waterway (Windawski Canal), which was to connect the new trading route to Ventspils, was relinquished due to unrest caused by the 1830–1831 November Uprising against Russia and revised trade agreements with Prussia.|$|E
