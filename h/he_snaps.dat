5|$|He then {{falls in}} love with Delilah in the valley of Sorek. The Philistines {{approach}} Delilah and induce her with 1,100 silver coins to find the secret of Samson's strength so that they can capture their enemy, but Samson refuses to reveal the secret and teases her, telling her that he will lose his strength if he is bound with fresh bowstrings. She does so while he sleeps, but when he wakes up <b>he</b> <b>snaps</b> the strings. She persists, and he tells her that he can be bound with new ropes. She ties him up with new ropes while he sleeps, and <b>he</b> <b>snaps</b> them, too. She asks again, and he says that he can be bound if his locks are woven into a weaver's loom. She weaves them into a loom, but he simply destroys the entire loom and carries it off when he wakes.|$|E
5|$|The episode makes {{references}} to Family Guy itself. When Bonnie, Lois and Cleveland's new girlfriend come to dance at The Drunken Clam, they state {{that they would}} like to make the bar their place to hang out, after Peter grabs Joe's gun and kills himself. It turns out that this was only Peter's imagination as <b>he</b> <b>snaps</b> out of it when Joe starts talking to him; Peter answers that he was having a Scrubs fantasy moment. Quagmire responds to Peter's moment by stating that Scrubs is the best show people are not watching. Cleveland replies that he hates shows that leave the story for a gag or joke, referring to the numerous cutaways Scrubs and Family Guy contain. While in the hospital Peter realizes that Mr. Pewterschmidt and Dr. Hartman have a similar voice, then Mr. Pewterschmidt comes into the room and they both start talking about how their voices sound alike; this is a reference to the show's creator Seth MacFarlane as he voices both characters.|$|E
5|$|Joe is victorious, and Captain Blue, {{finally coming}} to his senses, thanks the young hero for {{stopping}} him. He explains that two decades earlier, Blue was a revolutionary film maker who was soon {{thought of as}} a fad. Wanting nothing more than to create heroes, Blue was sucked into one of his own films, allowing him to live out his dream as a hero. However, he had lost touch with reality and wanted revenge on the people who had betrayed him. As Captain Blue and Silvia embrace in a heartfelt reunion, the director tells Joe that the story is not complete. <b>He</b> <b>snaps</b> his fingers, and the space station's onboard computer warns {{of a large number of}} UFOs heading towards Earth. Blue tells Joe that a hero will be needed twice more to save the world. Joe attempts to leave but not before Silvia requests a V-Watch from her father and to accompany her boyfriend. Viewtiful Joe and a newly transformed Silvia head out to stop the impending threat together.|$|E

5|$|The four spies head to City Hall to warn Mayor West {{about the}} sleeper agent, but they {{discover}} that the mayor is the sleeper agent when Aykroyd inadvertently uses the trigger phrase. During the ensuing fight, Aykroyd plants a homing beacon on Mayor West's leg. West escapes to Russia and the four follow him. They are quickly captured under orders of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who explains that the sleeper agent plan would be an embarrassment to their government if revealed to the public. He offers to help them stop West from fulfilling his pre-programmed mission. When the four find West, they see him launch a nuclear missile aimed at the United States before <b>he</b> <b>snaps</b> out of his trance. Mayor West holds himself responsible for America's fate, though Brian comforts him {{with the knowledge that}} West was not in control of his actions, having been brainwashed by the Soviets. Aykroyd realizes that he can hack into the missile's guidance system. This allows him to aim the missile's warhead high above the Earth's atmosphere and harmlessly explode, saving the US. The fuselage, though, crashes into Cleveland's house in Stoolbend, Virginia, while Cleveland was taking a bath, eliciting confusion from his neighbor, Tim the Bear. The episode ends with Brian and Stewie in the family living room as they recount their adventure and repeat the activation phrase, which reveals Meg to be another sleeper agent.|$|E
25|$|He bowls {{fast and}} {{obviously}} scorns to conserve his strength. He is {{in a hurry}} to be at the batsman. He turns sharply to begin his run, jumps off at a great pace, throws up his arm high, and then makes a terrifying leap into the air—a leap which one feels should be accompanied by a yell. At the end of his over <b>he</b> <b>snaps</b> up the ball, if it is anywhere within reach, and passes it hurriedly to the colleague who is having at them at the other end. With it all, his length was under control, and for a time the batsmen could make nothing of him.|$|E
25|$|After Voldemort's death, Harry {{uses the}} Elder Wand to repair his own damaged wand, then decides {{to return it}} to Dumbledore's tomb, {{so that when he}} has a natural death, the Elder Wand's power will die with him. In the film, Harry realizes that the Elder Wand is too {{powerful}} to fall into the wrong hands again, so <b>he</b> <b>snaps</b> it in two and throws it off a bridge. He also drops the Resurrection Stone in the Forbidden Forest but decides not to look for it in the hope that no wizard or witch {{will ever be able to}} own all three Hallows. He keeps the Cloak he had inherited, with the thought that he might pass it on to his children someday.|$|E

500|$|Marco's {{realization}} that Mulberry Street intersects with Bliss Street {{leads him to}} imagine a group of police escorts. The scene becomes a parade, as he then imagines a grand stand filled with the mayor and aldermen; an airplane dropping confetti; and, in the final incarnation of the scene, a Chinese man, a magician pulling rabbits out of a hat, and {{a man with a}} ten-foot beard. Now almost home, <b>he</b> <b>snaps</b> back to reality and rushes up the front steps, eager to tell his father his imagined story. However, when his father questions him about what he saw on his way home, his face turns red and he says, [...] "Nothing...but a plain horse and wagon on Mulberry Street." ...|$|E
500|$|Different {{styles of}} {{background}} music {{were used to}} convey certain things. For example, a guitar is played when Ishaan is tense or upset, sometimes with discordant notes. The music of the opening scene—the recurring [...] "Ishaan's Theme," [...] which represents the character's peace of mind—overpowers the background noise to show that Ishaan is lost in his own world; the noise becomes louder after <b>he</b> <b>snaps</b> back to reality. But the scene in which Nikumbh explains dyslexia to Ishaan's family took the opposite approach. Silent at first, the music is slowly introduced as the father begins to understand his son's dilemma. The almost seven-minute long scene scarcely used any background music, to slow the pace and make it seem more realistic.|$|E
500|$|Spacey {{summed up}} Underwood's {{relationship}} with the viewer - i.e. whenever he breaks the fourth wall - as being {{like that of a}} [...] "best friend" [...] and [...] "the person [...] more than anyone." [...] Because of this, his asides to the viewer serves as an indication of Underwood's true feelings and intentions - typically when he is feigning politeness and courtesy to people whom he despises. In the season 2 premiere, after having gone the whole episode without doing so, Underwood addresses the viewer directly, saying, [...] "Did you think I had forgotten you? Perhaps you hoped I had." [...] In addition, in season 3, after an argument with Claire that ends with her storming out on him, a seething Frank vents his anger by lashing out at the viewer; looking directly into the camera, <b>he</b> <b>snaps</b> [...] "What're you lookin' at?!" ...|$|E

500|$|Teddy is Mr. Bean's {{teddy bear}} and perhaps Mr. Bean's best friend. The little brown bear is a knitted oddity with button eyes and sausage-shaped limbs, which {{invariably}} end up broken in half or in various other states of destruction and disfiguration. Although Teddy is inanimate, Mr. Bean often pretends it is alive. For example, when Mr. Bean hypnotises Teddy, <b>he</b> <b>snaps</b> {{his fingers and}} the bear's head falls backwards {{as if it had}} fallen asleep instantly (Bean used his finger to prop Teddy's head up). Mr. Bean behaves as if the bear is real, buying it a Christmas present or trying not to wake it in the mornings. The bear is often privy to Mr. Bean's various schemes and doubles as a tool or other items in emergencies; it has been decapitated ("Mr. Bean in Room 426"), used as his paint brush ("Do-It-Yourself Mr. Bean"), and shrunk in the wash ("Tee Off, Mr. Bean"). Teddy is also Mr. Bean's [...] "pet" [...] in [...] "Hair by Mr. Bean of London" [...] and is used to win a pet show.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Ron and Tammys" [...] Tammy 1 assumes {{control of}} Ron, turning {{him into a}} mustache-less pushover {{in an effort to}} remarry him and take all his hidden gold. [...] This is quite the {{difference}} compared to the influence Ron's latest ex (Tammy 2) has over him. [...] While Tammy 1 has an ice cold personality and reduces Ron into submissiveness and quietude, Tammy 2 causes Ron to make highly irrational decisions that end up jeopardizing his position at the Parks office. [...] Tammy 2 also tries to assume control of Ron through using manipulation of her body. [...] Ron is saved from the grasp of Tammy 1 after his own mother, who is also ironically a Tammy- her name is Tamara (he refers to her as Tammy 0) to restore her son. [...] <b>He</b> <b>snaps</b> back to his old self after witnessing a drinking contest between Tammy 1 and Tammy 0. [...] They then drink in order to win control over Ron. Leslie also enters this competition in hopes of freeing him of the Tammys, however she ends up failing miserably due to the high alcohol content of Swanson family mash and is the first one out of the contest. In the end, Ron finally comes to his senses and stands up for himself and tells both Tammys to leave.|$|E
2500|$|A season 6 {{episode of}} the X-Files {{entitled}} [...] "Tithonus" [...] {{tells the story of}} a man cursed with immortality who works as a photographer taking photos of individuals who he can sense are close to death. <b>He</b> <b>snaps</b> these photos hoping to see the Grim Reaper and to die, finally, after having spent decades trapped in the land of the living.|$|E

2500|$|Conrad Heyer: In {{charge of}} [...] "The Eye"—the agency that {{controls}} the country's CCTV system. His wife Helen dominates him, and she intends for him to become leader, leaving her as the power behind the throne. V sends Conrad a videotape of Helen being unfaithful and <b>he</b> <b>snaps,</b> killing her lover Alistair Harper but sustaining a fatal wound from Harper's straight-edge razor in the process. When Helen learns what he has done, she is enraged at the destruction of her plans and leaves him to bleed to death, setting up a video camera connected to their TV {{so that he can}} watch himself die.|$|E
2500|$|Act 3 opens as a {{deliberate}} replay of Act1, {{but this time}} with Helena at the ironing-board wearing Jimmy's Act1 red shirt. Months have passed. Jimmy is notably more pleasant to Helena than he was to Alison in Act1. She actually laughs at his jokes, {{and the three of}} them (Jimmy, Cliff, and Helena) get into a music hall comedy routine that obviously is not improvised. Cliff announces that he's decided to strike out on his own. As Jimmy leaves the room to get ready for a final night out for the three of them, he opens the door to find Alison, looking like death. Instead of caring for her <b>he</b> <b>snaps</b> over his shoulder [...] "Friend of yours to see you" [...] and abruptly leaves.|$|E
2500|$|Both games feature three 'levels' of execution, {{with each}} level {{progressively}} more violent and graphic than the last. Level 1 executions are quick {{and not very}} bloody, Level 2 are considerably more gory, and Level 3 are over-the-top blood-soaked murders. The player him/herself is entirely in control of which level they use; once the player has locked onto an enemy, the lock-on reticule changes color over time to indicate the level; white (level 1), yellow (level 2), and, finally, red (level 3). As an example, in the first game, if using the plastic bag, a level 1 kill involves the player simply using the bag to suffocate the enemy. A level 2 kill involves him placing the bag over the enemy's head and kneeing them repeatedly in the face. A level 3 kill sees him strangle the enemy and turn them around to punch them in the face, whilst the enemy struggles to free himself and gasps for air. Eventually, <b>he</b> <b>snaps</b> the enemy's neck. For the sequel, although the basic gameplay remained the same, numerous changes {{were made to the}} mechanics. For example, players were given more choices in terms of executing enemies. As well as the three levels of execution per weapon, plays could now use firearms for executions. Two further additions to the execution system were [...] "environmental executions" [...] whereby the play could use elements of the game world (such as manhole covers, telephones, fuse boxes, toilets etc) to eliminate opponents, and [...] "jump executions" [...] whereby players can attack enemies from above by leaping off a ledge.|$|E
