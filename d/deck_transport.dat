Objectives of this study were to determine effects of seasonal environment, top and bottom <b>deck</b> <b>transport,</b> transport duration, and time in lairage on overall pork quality and blood serum concentrations of the stress hormone cortisol of market hogs. Mixed commercial crossbred market hogs (PIC, Franklin, KY) were harvested at dates representing traditional seasonal environments in the Midwestern United States. Within season, pigs were {{randomly assigned to one of}} 6 treatments in a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial arrangement, with two transport durations; short (3 hours) or long (6 hours), two trailer deck locations; top or bottom, and two lairage durations; short (3 hours) or long (6 hours). Blood was collected from each carcass at exsanguination for analysis of serum cortisol concentration. Fresh pork loin quality parameters were evaluated on boneless pork loins for color (L*, a*, and b*), pH, 24 h drip loss, and a subsequent determination of pale, soft and exudative (PSE) lean. Least-squares means were generated and tested for least significant difference across all main effects and appropriate interactions for fresh pork quality parameters and serum cortisol concentration. Cortisol levels were the greatest during the summer and fall seasons and interacted significantly (P [lesser than] 0. 05) between lairage, deck, and haul. Furthermore, pigs removed from the bottom deck entering short lairage generated 5. 28 % PSE loins while the pigs that came off the bottom deck into a long lairage generated 2. 86 % PSE loins...|$|E

5000|$|During the Suez crisis she {{was used}} to land the {{transport}} for 45 Commando which was part of the first ever, operational helicopter assault. In 1964, she was converted into a dedicated helicopter training ship; this involved converting the deck in front of the superstructure into a landing platform. There was no hangar and minimal support facilities - the ship was essentially a platform for practising landings at sea, and a <b>deck</b> to <b>transport</b> helicopters on. In 1967, the Lofoten was replaced in this role by the purpose built RFA Engadine.|$|R

50|$|The above {{describes}} a typical transport system; however, manufacturers engineered many alternative designs. For example, some designs used a horizontal <b>transport</b> <b>deck</b> where the operator simply set the tape reel {{in the supply}} reel bay, {{closed the door and}} pressed the load button, then a vacuum system would draw the tape along the path and onto a take-up hub within the mechanism. Some designs eliminated the vacuum columns in favor of a microprocessor-controlled direct drive design.|$|R

50|$|When {{the railroads}} and cattle {{industry}} failed {{to act quickly}} enough to correct these perceived deficiencies, the government and even the general public went into action. Claims were made that the meat of neglected animals was unfit for human consumption. In 1869, Illinois passed the first laws to limit the animals' time on board, and required them to be given 5 hours' rest for every 28 in transit. Some railroads stepped in with their own new designs at this time, such as the Pennsylvania Railroad's class KA stock car, a design first published in 1869 which featured a removable second <b>deck</b> for <b>transporting</b> pigs or sheep. However, double-deck stock cars had been experimented with {{as early as the}} 1830s on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in England. Other states such as Ohio and Massachusetts soon followed with similar legislation, though effective federal laws were not enacted until the passing of the Federal Meat Inspection Act of 1906.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the morning}} of 24 October, Tang began patrolling at periscope depth. She {{surfaced}} at dark and headed for Turnabout Island (...) [...] On approaching the island, the submarine's surface search radar showed so many blips {{that it was almost}} useless. Tang soon identified a large convoy which contained tankers with planes on their <b>decks</b> and <b>transports</b> with crated planes stacked on their bows and sterns. As the submarine tracked the Japanese ships along the coast, the convoy's escorts became suspicious, and the escort commander began signaling with a large searchlight. This illuminated the convoy, and Tang chose a large three-deck transport as her first target, a smaller transport as the second, and a large tanker as the third. Their ranges varied from 900 - 1400 yd. After firing two torpedoes at each target, the submarine paralleled the convoy to choose its next victims. She fired stern torpedoes at another transport and tanker aft.|$|R
40|$|Issues {{of flight}} deck {{automation}} are multifaceted and complex. The rapid introduction of advanced computer-based technology onto the flight <b>deck</b> of <b>transport</b> category aircraft has had considerable impact both on aircraft operations {{and on the}} flight crew. As part of NASA's responsibility to facilitate an active exchange of ideas and information {{among members of the}} aviation community, a NASA/FAA/Industry workshop devoted to flight deck automation, organized by the Aerospace Human Factors Research Division of NASA Ames Research Center. Participants were invited from industry and from government organizations responsible for design, certification, operation, and accident investigation of transport category, automated aircraft. The goal of the workshop was to clarify the implications of automation, both positive and negative. Workshop panels and working groups identified issues regarding the design, training, and procedural aspects of flight deck automation, as well as the crew's ability to interact and perform effectively with the new technology. The proceedings include the invited papers and the panel and working group reports, as well as the summary and conclusions of the conference...|$|R
40|$|Riprap rundowns {{are often}} used by the New Mexico Department of Transportation (NMDOT) to capture and drain the runoff {{approaching}} or leaving bridge decks. Rundowns are generally located {{at the ends of}} a bridge <b>deck</b> to <b>transport</b> the water down the surface of the slopes of bridge embankments. They constitute {{an important part of the}} bridge drainage system. In some occasions, riprap rundowns have also been used for drainage and erosion protection of slopes and embankments along highways in New Mexico. The NMDOT Drainage Section identified recurrent failures of the riprap rundown structures throughout the state. The poor performance and failures of the riprap rundowns in some areas have required costly maintenance repairs and reconstruction. This study is aimed at identifying and characterizing the most frequent failure modes for riprap rundowns and providing best management practice (BMP) recommendations to improve the performance of these structures. Design, materials and construction issues were considered. Selected cases of rundowns that exhibited typical problems were described in this report to illustrate the failure modes and performance problems. 17.

5000|$|The first ship of {{a series}} of three Sea Bee ships was SS Doctor Lykes, {{followed}} by SS Almeria Lykes and SS Tillie Lykes all of which were operated by Lykes Brothers Steamship Company. The [...] "Sea Bee" [...] vessels had three <b>decks</b> and could <b>transport</b> 38 lighters (12 on the lower decks and 14 on the upper deck). The dual function of the ship is noteworthy, as it had storage tanks with a capacity of nearly 36000 mÂ³ volume built into its sides and unusually large double hull, allowing it to be used also as a product tanker. The ships were later purchased by Military Sealift Command.|$|R

50|$|The Whidbey Island-class dock {{landing ship}} is a dock landing ship of the United States Navy. Introduced to fleet service in 1985, {{this class of}} ship {{features}} a massive well <b>deck</b> for the <b>transport</b> of United States Marine Corps (USMC) vehicles and a large flight deck for the landing of helicopters or V-22 Ospreys. The well deck was designed to hold four LCAC hovercraft, five if the vehicle ramp is raised, for landing Marines. Recent deployments have instead filled the well deck {{with a combination of}} LCU(s), AAVs, Tanks, LARCs and other USMC vehicles and gear. The Whidbey Island class of ship also uniquely benefits from multiple cranes and a shallow draft that further make it ideal for participating in amphibious operations.|$|R

50|$|The viaduct was {{designed}} to facilitate mass transit; its upper deck accommodated trams, while both the Don Valley phase and the Rosedale Valley phase included a lower <b>deck</b> for rail <b>transport,</b> controversial at the time because of its high additional cost. The bridge's designer and the commissioner of public works, R.C. Harris, were able to have their way and the lower deck eventually proved to save millions of dollars when the Toronto Transit Commission's Bloor-Danforth subway opened in 1966. The Rosedale Valley phase was not used for the subway, as the curve between each phase, {{as well as the}} curve to the west at Parliament Street, was considered too sharp for the subway.
