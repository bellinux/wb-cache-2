5000|$|In textual studies, a {{palimpsest}} (...) is {{a manuscript}} page, either from a scroll or a book, {{from which the}} text has been scraped or washed off so that the page can be reused for another document. Pergamene (now known as parchment) was made of baby lamb or <b>kid</b> <b>skin</b> (best made in ancient Pergamon) and was expensive and not readily available, so {{in the interest of}} economy a pergamene often was re-used by scraping the previous writing. In colloquial usage, the term palimpsest is also used in architecture, archaeology, and geomorphology to denote an object made or worked upon for one purpose and later reused for another, for example a monumental brass the reverse blank side of which has been re-engraved.|$|E

40|$|This {{trial is}} aimed to study leather {{properties}} that produced from Sudan Desert {{sheep and goats}} in relation to breed type and age category. Thirty pieces of fresh sheep and goats skins were collected randomly (15 for each) during January 2015. The collected skins were tanned and the produced leather properties were studied. The Statistix 8 program for variance analysis was used for data analysis. The study samples were taken according to the Complete Randomized Design. Sheep leather results revealed that, lamb's skin was significantly (P ≥ 0. 05) produced better quality leather than ram's and ewe's skins in elongation (%), tensile strength (kg/cm 2), cracking load (kg), thickness (mm), tear load (kg/cm), flexibility and moisture%. While it was yielded leather with the same characteristics to ram's and ewe's leather in Ash (%), fat (%) and chrome (%). Leather properties [elongation (%), tensile strength (kg/cm 2), cracking load (kg), tear load (kg/cm), flexibility and Ash (%) ] were significantly (P ≥ 0. 05) affected by breed variation. On the other hand thickness (mm), moisture (%), fat (%) and chrome (%) were not significantly (P ≥ 0. 05) affected by breed. Ram's skin was produced better quality leather than ewe's skins. Goat's leather results revealed that, <b>kid</b> goat's <b>skin</b> was significantly (P ≥ 0. 05) produced better quality leather than bucks and doe's skin in tensile strength (kg/cm 2), cracking load (kg), thickness (mm), tear load (kg/cm) and flexibility degree.

Generally Desert goats produce slightly better quality leather than Nubian goats. Leather prosperities [cracking load (kg), tear load (kg/cm), and Ash (%) ] were significantly (P ≥ 0. 05) affected by breed variation.

5000|$|The cimboa is {{composed}} [...] {{of the instrument}} proper and its bow. The instrument belongs to the lute family, and so it possesses a neck attached to a sound box. The sound box is made of a calebash, or when {{it is hard to}} find, with a coconut shell, with a soundboard of stretched <b>kid</b> <b>skin,</b> fixed with reed pieces. Attached to the sound box there is a neck made of flexible wood (pine). At the end of the neck is a tuning peg of mahogany to tune the sole string of the instrument which is stretched between the nut set in the neck, and the bridge placed on the soundboard. The bow is made of a curved wood (called barnelo in Cape Verde) piece and strung with horse mane. Sound is produced by rubbing the bow on the instrument's string, which is also made of horse mane. The pitch of the notes is changed by pressing the string against several points on the neck. The neck's flexibility allows bending effects of the notes by bending the neck.|$|E

40|$|In this {{research}} it is aimed to combine usage of valonia or modified valonia with oxazolidine {{to obtain an}} increase in hydrothermal stability, thus to devolope tanning efficiency and to produce leathers that have better properties then the ones tanned with valonea only. On the other hand, oak trees, which produce tannins of valonea, grow in the western parts of Turkey and its extract is known as valex. So, an increase in valonea consumption was also expected. Experiments conducted with 94 halfs of pickled <b>kid</b> <b>skins</b> that have same properties as a uniform party. Natural and three modified valonia extracts and oxazolidine were used as tanning materials. Skin samples {{were divided into two}} main groups according to the tannage system. In first group which was called A, valonia extracts were used as tanning materials in a fix ratio of 20 % and oxazolidines as retanning ones. Group A was divided into 4 subgroups according to the used extracts types. And each subgroup was also seperated into four lots according to the oxozolidine percentages used (e. g. 0 - 2 - 4 and 6 which use as retanning materials). In group B, oxazolidines were used as pretanning agents and extracts as tannin...|$|R

Isaac felt him and wondered that the voice was Jacob's, but the hands were Esau's.

60|$|It was a {{kid that}} he had come to roast. But it {{was a kid}} opened out, made quite flat, and speared like a flat fan on a long iron stalk. It was a really curious sight. And it must have taken some doing. The whole of the <b>skinned</b> <b>kid</b> was there, the head curled in against a shoulder, the stubby cut ears, the eyes, the teeth, the few hairs of the nostrils: and the feet curled curiously round, like an animal that puts its fore-paw over its ducked head: and the hind-legs twisted indescribably up: and all {{skewered}} flat-wise upon the long iron rod, so that it was a complete flat pattern. It reminded me intensely of those distorted, slim-limbed, dog-like animals which figure on the old Lombard ornaments, distorted and curiously infolded upon themselves. Celtic illuminations also have these distorted, involuted creatures.|$|R
40|$|In this study, survey {{had been}} {{performed}} in Khartoum area {{so as to}} identify infected animals with mange. Three infected kids were selected from thousand animals in Abu Zeid Market (Omdurman area), during the winter. Skin scraping was immediately performed from lesions of infected kids, samples were transferred to laboratory for investigation of mange and its species classification. Microscopical examination revealed Sarcoptic mange. Eight kids were purchased from locations with no history of previous mange. These animals had been divided into two groups: 1 - Four kids had been infected experimentally by the inoculation of samples of mange into the <b>kid’s</b> <b>skin.</b> 2 - Four kids had been infected by contact; these kids were closed with naturally infected kids on one place. In experimental infection two kids died due to heavy infection with Sarcoptic mange. The two remaining kids were alive {{until the end of}} the experiment. In the contact infection kids, all kids survived mange infection and the treatment. Ten days after the beginning of the experiment all kids were itchy shaking their heads and moving their tails. On the day 15 th white dots appeared and small papules changing to red and filled with scabs. Lesions were firstly seen on the face, eyelids and lips then on the neck, chest and flank. On day 40 th numerous lesions were obvious. Once again skin scraping had been done. Microscopic examination revealed the agent of sarcoptic mange. In this trial Ivermectin was used subcutaneously in treating Sarcoptic mange. In treating naturally infected group Ivermectin had been used at 200 μg/kg 16 dose. In contact infection group Ivermectin had been used at dose rate of 0. 533 mg/kg also it had been used 0. 533 mg/kg in treating experimental infection group. Ivermectin was using three weeks apart for one month intervals. Lesions were healing on the first week of the first injection and were completely absent after the third injection with Ivermectin. For haematological purposes, blood samples were collected prior to infection with Sarcoptic mange and blood sample continued to show the relationship between Sarcoptic mange infection and the levels of haemoglobin and packed cell volume, reduction in Hb and PCV was noted after animals were heavily infected with mange. For biochemical purposes, lower levels had been noted in the infected kids in blood cholesterol, creatinine, GOT, iron and protein. However, higher levels were obtained in blood urea. In treated animals, Ivermectin had no effect on haematological or biochemical series, however the only sign of effect was a rise in blood urea. For histopathological investigation specimens had been taken from (liver, kidney, intestine, spleen, heart, lung and testis), liver showed Hepatocellular degeneration and focal necrotic area, the small intestine showed oedema, congestion epithethelium desquamation and catarrhal enteritis. The spleen showed nercrotic area and haemosidrosis. In the lung hypostatic pneumonea and congestion were seen. In the kidney tubular nephrosis and congestion was seen, tissue section of heart showed myocardial degeneration and haemosiderosis. Moreover, testis showed interfolicular oedema and congestion. These changings in their tissues were due to Sarcoptic mange infection. For comparison between the three groups, natural infections, experimental infection and contact infection it was observed that lesions were appearing faster in experimental infection than contact infection. Contact infection kids and natural infection ones could resist mange becoming immune to the disease, when compared...|$|R
