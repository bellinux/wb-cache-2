500|$|... "Office Olympics" [...] {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Michael Sciannamea of TV Squad {{wrote that}} [...] "The Office {{has turned the}} corner into separating itself from the [...] British version." [...] Sciannamea {{went on to say}} that [...] "although Michael still garners the most attention, the other characters are beginning to break out." [...] His only criticism of the episode was that [...] "Dwight is too creepy", Sciannamea suggested that the writers [...] "tone down his insanity a bit". [...] "Miss Alli" [...] of Television Without Pity graded the episode with a [...] "A-". Erik Adams of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an [...] "A" [...] and called it the show's [...] "first truly classic episode", due to the added [...] "verve" [...] of both plots. Adams praised the way the main story and Jim and Pam's stories were intercut with each other, so that both could play off of each other; he wrote that [...] "Michael Schur’s a great writer, and Paul Feig knows how to let superb comedic performances flow from his actors, but the stitch-up <b>job</b> <b>here</b> makes the two halves of the episodes complementary when they could’ve rocketed in opposite directions and ripped 'Office Olympics' apart." ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} generally mixed reception from critics. The {{day after the}} premiere, Mark Lorando of The Times-Picayune wrote that while it was [...] "not the laugh riot The Simpsons have spoiled us to expect – our appetite for showbiz parodies is waning – the episode did have its moments." [...] He further added that he especially liked [...] "the sign posted outside the movie studio gate: 'No Artistic Integrity Beyond This Point.'" [...] While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented on the episode, writing that [...] "Gibson actually does a good <b>job</b> <b>here,</b> and it’s amusing to see Homer’s terrible movie ideas. This isn’t classic Simpsons, but it starts the season on a pretty good note." [...] However, an article in Salon magazine from 2000 points to [...] "Beyond Blunderdome" [...] as the greatest precursor to that Homer would be more predominant as “Jerkass Homer” in the Scully era as showrunner, a Homer who [...] "is not only dumb, but [...] disgusting and semi-sociopathic. This is the Homer who, in the season opener , showed Marge's wedding ring to Mel Gibson and stated, 'This is a symbol that as per our marriage, she's my property and I own her.'" [...] Gibson's performance has generally been praised. Simon Crerar of The Times listed his performance {{as one of the}} thirty-three funniest cameos {{in the history of the}} show. Similarly, Total Films Nathan Ditum ranked Gibson's performance as the seventh best guest appearance in the show's history in a list of twenty people, calling it [...] "Another ace self-effacing appearance from a Hollywood high-flyer".|$|E

2500|$|The Nottingham preview was the {{production}} reviewed in The Guardian on 28 September 1954, {{rather than the}} later West End opening. The critic was not over-enthusiastic, calling it, [...] "Confusing" [...] and stating, [...] "The piece hardly calls for moralising, though {{there will always be}} people who find it hard to laugh at jokes about the disposal of corpses. Yet it is as comedy, rather than mystery, that it must stand or fall. Miss Lockwood, though born to be sincere, has the <b>job</b> <b>here</b> of hauling rather substantial red herrings all over the stage to try and give us the impression that she is a sly minx who has either done the deed herself or else is shielding her neurotic little stepdaughter. Tonight's audience evidently fell deeply for the wiles of Miss Lockwood. Artful finger on chin, or fluttering hand emphasising some particularly disingenuous point, she earns every word of the police inspector's tribute when he says: 'You haven't made things easy for us with your tall stories.'" ...|$|E

In November 1982 she left Thames, but remained as Chief Executive at Euston until leaving in November of the following year to take up her first post in the film industry, as Director of Production for Thorn EMI Screen Entertainment. Her <b>job</b> <b>here</b> was somewhat frustrating as the British film industry was in one of its periodic states of flux, but she did produce several feature films, including Clockwise (1986). Lambert later expressed some regret on her time in the film industry in a feature for The Independent newspaper. [...] "Unfortunately, the person who hired me left, and the person who came in didn't want to produce films and didn't want me. While I managed to make some films I was proud of — Dennis Potter's Dreamchild, and Clockwise with John Cleese — it was terribly tough and not a very happy experience." ...|$|E
