25|$|Sonic {{hedgehog}} (SHH) is a signaling molecule that is encoded by {{the same}} gene sonic hedgehog. SHH plays very important role in organogenesis and most importantly craniofacial development. Being that SHH is a signaling molecule it primarily works by diffusion along a concentration gradient affecting cells in different manners. In early tooth development, SHH is released from the primary enamel knot, a signaling center, to provide positional information in both a lateral and planar signaling pattern in tooth development and regulation of tooth cusp growth. SHH in particular is needed for growth of epithelial cervical loops, where the outer and inner epitheliums join and form a reservoir for dental stem cells. After the primary enamel knots are apoptosed, the secondary enamel knots are formed. The secondary enamel knots secrete SHH {{in combination with other}} signaling molecules to thicken the oral ectoderm and begin patterning the complex shapes of the crown of a tooth during differentiation and mineralization. In a <b>knockout</b> <b>gene</b> model, absence of SHH is indicative of holoprosencephaly. However SHH activates downstream molecules of Gli2 & Gli3. Mutant Gli2 and Gli3 embryos have abnormal development of incisors that are arrested at early in tooth development as well as small molars.|$|E
50|$|The DMRT1 gene {{is located}} {{at the end of the}} 9th chromosome. This gene is a dose {{sensitive}} transcription factor protein that regulates Sertoli cells and germ cell. The majority DMRT1 protein is located in the testicular cord and Sertoli cells, with a small amount in the germ cells. Two copies of the DMRT1 gene are required for normal sexual development. When a DMRT1 gene is lost the most common disease is chromosome 9p deletion, which causes abnormal testicular formation and feminization. The DMRT1 gene is critical in the male sex determination and without this gene the default female characteristic takes over and male characteristic is slight or non-existent. In the knockout model of this gene, the mice showed changes in both Sertoli and germ cells soon after the gonadal ridge was formed. The main defects associated with this <b>knockout</b> <b>gene</b> were developmental arrest, excess proliferation of germ cells, and failure to undergo meiosis, mitosis, or migration. Thus, the knockout model shows that loss of the DMRT1 gene is associated with incomplete germ cell development leading to infertility, abnormal testicular formation, and/or feminization of the affected individual.|$|E

50|$|Conditional <b>gene</b> <b>knockout</b> is a {{technique}} used to eliminate a specific gene in a certain tissue, such as the liver. This technique is useful to study the role of individual genes in living organisms. It differs from traditional <b>gene</b> <b>knockout</b> because it targets specific genes at specific times rather than being deleted from beginning of life. Using the conditional <b>gene</b> <b>knockout</b> technique eliminates many of the side effects from traditional <b>gene</b> <b>knockout.</b> In traditional <b>gene</b> <b>knockout,</b> embryonic death from a gene mutation can occur, and this prevents scientists from studying the gene in adults. Some tissues cannot be studied properly in isolation, so the gene must be inactive in a certain tissue while remaining active in others. With this technology, scientists are able to <b>knockout</b> <b>genes</b> at a specific stage in development and study how the <b>knockout</b> of a <b>gene</b> in one tissue affects the same gene in other tissues.|$|R

At first, biological networks are constructed from such databases and configure experimental conditions by giving source metabolites, target metabolites, and <b>knockout</b> <b>genes.</b> All minimal active pathways are then enumerated, which are minimal subsets of a given network using source metabolites to produce target metabolites. Finally, the effects of <b>gene</b> <b>knockouts</b> are predicted by measuring the difference of mini-mal active pathways between original networks and knockout ones. In the experiments, we applied it to predict the single <b>gene</b> <b>knockout</b> effects on the glycolysis pathway and amino acids biosynthesis in Escherichia coli.

50|$|The {{molecular}} {{function of}} human ectodermin {{to act as}} a negative regulator of Smad4 suggests that this specific function is conserved among the vertebrate lineage. The sequence identity between FAM homologs is higher than 90% when comparing the homologs of Xenopus, zebrafish, mouse, and human, suggesting that this might also be conserved among other organisms. Indeed, <b>knockout</b> <b>gene</b> inactivation in mouse embryos showed that the function of ectodermin as inhibitor of TGF-beta signaling is conserved. Embryos lacking of ectodermin show defective development of the anterior visceral endoderm (AVE), which is the first tissue that is induced by TGF-beta signals in mouse embryos; in accordance with loss of an inhibitor, ectodermin-/- embryos showed enlarged AVE induction. As the AVE is a natural source of secreted TGF-beta antagonists, this primary AVE expansion caused secondarily, at later stages, an inhibition of extracellular TGF-beta ligands, resulting in embryos lacking of mesoderm development. This model was confirmed by the finding that ectodermin-/- embryos were rescued to wild type (normal AVE, normal mesoderm development) by lowering the genetic dosage of the main TGF-beta ligand of the emrbyo, Nodal. Further supporting a role as TGF-beta inhibitor, tissue-selective deletion of ectodermin from the epiblast (from which the mesoderm, but not the AVE, derive) left the AVE untouched but caused this time an expansion of anterior mesodermal fates, indicative of increased responsiveness to TGF-beta signals. Collectively, these data confirmed with genetic tools a cell-autonomous role for ectodermin as inhibitor of Smad4 responses previously identified in Xenopus embryos and human cell lines.|$|E

The protein has since {{been referred to as}} dehydrin and has been the identified as the genetic basis of drought tolerance in plants. However, the first direct genetic evidence of dehydrin playing a role in cellular protection during osmotic shock was not observed until 2005, in the moss, Physcomitrella patens. In order to show a direct correlation between DHN and stress recovery, a <b>knockout</b> <b>gene</b> was created, which interfered with DHNA’s functionality. After being placed in an environment with salt and osmotic stress and then later being returned to a standard growth medium, the P. patens wildtype was able to recover to 94% of its fresh weight while the P. patens mutant only reached 39% of its fresh weight. This study also concludes that DHN production allows plants to function in high salt concentrations. Another study found evidence of DHN’s impact in drought-stress recovery by showing that transcription levels of a DHN increased in a drought-tolerant pine, Pinus pinaster, when placed in a drought treatment. However, transcription levels of a DHN decreased in the same drought treatment in a drought-sensitive P. pinaster. Drought-tolerance is a complex trait, thus that it cannot be genetically analyzed as a single gene trait. The exact mechanism of drought tolerance is yet to be determined and is still being researched. One chemical mechanism related to DHN production is the presence of the phytohormone ABA. One common response to environmental stresses is process known as cellular dehydration. Cellular dehydration induces biosynthesis of abscisic acid (ABA), which is known to react as a stress hormone because of its accumulation in the plant under water stress conditions. ABA also participates in stress signal transduction pathways ABA has been shown to increase the production of DHN, which provides more evidence of a link between DHN and drought tolerance.|$|E

30|$|Another {{example of}} a genetically {{modified}} model {{is the use of}} Col 9 a 1 (−/−) mice [18, 19]. These mice have collagen type IX alpha 1 gene inactivation and they are frequently used to characterize the role of collagen type IX in the pathogenesis of OA [18, 19]. Costello et al. used this method and found that male mice homozygous for this gene inactivation developed OA and associated increased tactile pain sensitivity and gait alterations by 9  months of age [20]. They were able to use this model to evaluate the degree to which OA impacts locomotor activity in mice [20]. Another genotype of mice that is highly susceptible to OA is interleukin- 6 <b>knockout</b> <b>gene</b> mice (IL- 6 (−/−)) [21]. These mice have a deficiency in interleukin 6 which results in decreased proteoglycan synthesis and reduced bone morphology density among male IL- 6 (−/−) mice compared to their wild type counterparts. This leads to the development of more severe OA among these mice [21].|$|E
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, mice {{can also be}} genetically {{modified}} {{in an attempt to}} make them less susceptible to OA. For instance, mice with a <b>knockout</b> <b>gene</b> that encodes a protease specific to the knee joint might be less likely to develop OA than wild type mice. Genetically modifying mice to find protective factors is a promising avenue in developing future treatments for OA [22]. For example, Motomura et al. found that c-Fos/activator protein (AP)- 1 inhibitor, T- 5224, which inhibits matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) prevents cartilage destruction and reduces rates of OA in mice [22]. The advantage of using mice which are likely to develop OA is that it saves researchers time and money compared to using wild type mice which have a lower incidence of OA [5, 6, 8]. Due to the tremendous variability in susceptibility to OA among different strains of mice, {{it is very important that}} any study using mice specify the type of mice used in the study [23].|$|E

In a rat model involving infusion of ferrous citrate (FC) that simulates iron accumulation after hemorrhage, {{a higher degree}} of autophagy associated with higher injury severity was observed in striatum of males than in females. Since the imbalance between the levels of autophagy and energy demand may lead to cell death, we proposed that FC-induced autophagy is detrimental in a male specific manner and autophagy modulation affects injury severity in a sex-dependent manner. Rapamycin, an autophagy inducer, and conditional <b>knockout</b> <b>gene</b> of autophagy-related protein 7 (Atg 7) in dopamine receptor D 2 (DRD 2) neurons were used to test our hypothesis using a mouse model with striatal FC infusion. The result showed that the levels of autophagic cell death and injury severity were higher in male than in female mice. Pre-treatment of FC-infused females with rapamycin increased the FC-induced behavioral deficit and DRD 2 neuron death. However, DRD 2 neuron-specific knockout of Atg 7 decreased FC-induced injury severity and the number of TUNEL(+) DRD 2 neurons in males. These results suggest that autophagy in FC-infusion males is overactive with maladaptive consequences and inhibition of autophagy decreases the severity of FC-induced striatal injury in males.

40|$|Effect of the {{specific}} <b>gene</b> <b>knockout</b> on the main metabolism in Escherichia coli was reviewed, and the regulation mechanisms were clarified based on different levels of information such as gene expressions, enzyme activities, intracellular metabolite concentrations, and metabolic fluxes together with fermentation data. The effects of the <b>knockout</b> of such <b>genes</b> as pflA, pta, ppc, pykF, adhE, and ldhA on the metabolic changes were analyzed for the case under anaerobic condition. The effects of the <b>knockout</b> of such <b>genes</b> as pgi, zwf, gnd, ppc pck, pyk, and lpdA on the metabolic changes were also analyzed for the case under aerobic condition. The metabolic regulation analysis was made focusing on the roles of transcription factors. </p...|$|R
40|$|Conditional {{gene repair}} {{mutations}} in the mouse {{can assist in}} cell lineage analyses and provide a valuable complement to conditional gene inactivation strategies. We present a method for the generation of conditional gene repair mutations that employs a loxP-flanked (floxed) selectable marker and transcriptional/translational stop cassette (neostop) located within the first intron of a target gene. In the absence of Cre recombinase, expression of the targeted allele is suppressed generating a null allele, while {{in the presence of}} Cre, excision of neostop restores expression to wild-type levels. To test this strategy, we have generated a conditional gene repair allele of the mouse Huntington’s disease gene homolog (Hdh). Insertion of neostop within the Hdh intron 1 generated a null allele and mice homozygous for this allele resembled nullizygous Hdh mutants and died after embryonic day 8. 5. In the presence of a cre transgene expressed ubiquitously early in development, excision of neostop restored Hdh expression and rescued the early embryonic lethality. A simple modification of this strategy that permits the generation of conventional <b>gene</b> <b>knockout,</b> conditional <b>gene</b> <b>knockout</b> and conditional <b>gene</b> repair alleles using one targeting construct is discussed...|$|R

Microbial strain optimisation for the overproduction of a desired phenotype has been a popular topic in recent years. <b>Gene</b> <b>knockout</b> is a genetic engineering technique that can modify the metabolism of microbial cells to obtain desirable phenotypes. Optimisation algorithms {{have been developed to}} identify the effects of <b>gene</b> <b>knockout.</b> However, the complexities of metabolic networks have made the process of identifying the effects of geneticmodification on desirable phenotypes challenging. Furthermore, a vast number of reactions in cellular metabolism often lead to a combinatorial problem in obtaining optimal <b>gene</b> <b>knockout.</b> The computational time increases exponentially as the size of the problem increases. This work reports an extension of Bees Hill Flux Balance Analysis (BHFBA) to identify optimal <b>gene</b> <b>knockouts</b> to maximise the production yield of desired phenotypes while sustaining the growth rate. This proposed method functions by integrating OptKnock into BHFBA for validating the results automatically. The results show that the extension of BHFBA is suitable, reliable, and applicable in predicting <b>gene</b> <b>knockout.</b> Through several experiments conducted on Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Clostridium thermocellum as model organisms, extension of BHFBA has show...|$|R
