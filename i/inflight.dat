5|$|On May 21, 2009, Virgin America {{became the}} first U.S. airline to offer Wi-Fi access via Gogo <b>Inflight</b> Internet on every flight. Between November 10, 2009, and January 15, 2010, the airline offered free WiFi with a subsidy from Google. On December 17, 2014, Virgin America {{announced}} that it would be offering faster fleet-wide ATG-4 <b>inflight</b> WiFi service from Gogo, with speeds three times faster than the first generation system.|$|E
5|$|Since its {{founding}} in 1985, the airline has been investing into airline-related servicing companies, including <b>inflight</b> catering, ground handling and service equipment companies.|$|E
5|$|Biman relaunched its <b>inflight</b> {{magazine}} re-branded as Bihanga in September 2013. The bi-monthly magazine, previously {{known as}} Diganta, and {{prior to that}} Jatri, is published by Subcontinental Media Group. The magazine is available in both Bengali and English, covering topics about Bangladesh and Biman's destinations. English and Bengali language newspapers are also available on board in the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The F-84 was {{the first}} {{production}} fighter aircraft to utilize <b>inflight</b> refueling and the first fighter capable of carrying a nuclear weapon, the Mark 7 nuclear bomb. Modified F-84s were used in several unusual projects, including the FICON and Tom-Tom dockings to the B-29 Superfortress and B-36 bomber motherships, and the experimental XF-84H Thunderscreech turboprop.|$|E
5|$|Two-seat {{training}} {{version for}} the Royal Air Force, one prototype and 38 production aircraft built. Capable of secondary role of strike and ground attack. Two flown by Empire Test Pilots School {{and one by}} Institute of Aviation Medicine. Equipped for <b>inflight</b> refuelling and with a single Aden cannon.|$|E
5|$|Around 1954, NATC {{modified}} the sole surviving XAJ-1 to conduct <b>inflight</b> refueling tests using the probe and drogue configuration. The turbojet engine was removed and the fuel hose and its drogue extended {{out from the}} jet's former exhaust opening. Aircraft in service retained the turbojet and had their bomb bay doors modified to accommodate the hose and drogue. They were refueling aircraft during late 1954.|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong Airlines’ growing network {{currently}} covers over 30 cities regionally, including Auckland, Gold Coast, Shanghai, Sanya, Bangkok, Bali, Tokyo, Sapporo, Beijing, Colombo, Vancouver, and Los Angeles.. The airline has {{a combined}} fleet of 35 aircraft. The current passenger fleet has 31 aircraft, which includes one Airbus A350-900, ten Airbus A330-300s, nine Airbus A330-200s and eleven A320s, with <b>inflight</b> entertainment system {{and an average}} age of around 5.0 years as of September 2017. The cargo fleet consists of four Airbus A330-200Fs.|$|E
5|$|The Tornado ADV (air defence variant) was an {{interceptor}} {{variant of}} the Tornado, developed for the RAF (designated Tornado F2 or F3) and also operated by Saudi Arabia and Italy. The ADV had inferior agility to fighters like the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle, {{but it was not}} intended as a dog-fighter, instead it was a long-endurance interceptor to counter the threat from Cold War bombers. Although the ADV had 80% parts commonality with the Tornado IDS, the ADV had greater acceleration, improved RB199 Mk.104 engines, a stretched body, greater fuel capacity, the AI.24 Foxhunter radar, and software changes. It had only one cannon to accommodate a retractable <b>inflight</b> refuelling probe.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in March 2013, the {{majority}} of the airline's fleet will be retrofitted with new Business and Economy Class seats. The seats are nearly identical to the new Regional Business Class and new Long-haul Economy Class products offered by parent company Cathay Pacific. Seats in both classes will be fitted with StudioKA (a rebranded version of the StudioCX <b>inflight</b> entertainment system on board Cathay Pacific aircraft), which features a 12.1-inch (Business Class) or 9-inch (Economy Class) touchscreen display, Audio/Video on Demand (AVOD), support for iOS devices, and a USB port for connectivity to other devices. In-seat power outlets will be available to all passengers. The new Business Class will feature a 21-inch wide recliner seat with 45 inches (narrowbody aircraft) or 47 inches (widebody aircraft) of pitch, while the new Economy Class will be 18.1 inches wide with 30 inches (narrowbody aircraft) or 32 inches (widebody aircraft) of pitch. The retrofitting process is expected to be complete by the end of 2014.|$|E
5|$|On 21 May 1956, a B-52B (52-0013) {{dropped a}} Mk-15 nuclear bomb over the Bikini Atoll {{in a test}} code-named Cherokee. It was the first air-dropped {{thermonuclear}} weapon. From 24 to 25 November 1956, four B-52Bs of the 93rd BW and four B-52Cs of the 42nd BW flew nonstop {{around the perimeter of}} North America in Operation Quick Kick, which covered 15,530miles (13,500nmi, 25,000km) in 31 hours, 30 minutes. SAC noted the flight time could have been reduced by 5 to 6 hours had the four <b>inflight</b> refuelings been done by fast jet-powered tanker aircraft rather than propeller-driven Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighters. In a demonstration of the B-52's global reach, from 16 to 18 January 1957, three B-52Bs made a non-stop flight around the world during Operation Power Flite, during which 24,325miles (21,145nmi, 39,165km) was covered in 45 hours 19 minutes (536.8 smph) with several in-flight refuelings by KC-97s.|$|E
5|$|The log-on message {{sent from}} the {{aircraft}} at 08:19:29 {{was not immediately}} well understood. The 02:25 handshake was also initiated by the aircraft. Only a few reasons that the SDU would transmit a log-on message exist, such as a power interruption, software failure, loss of critical systems providing input to the SDU, or a loss of the link due to aircraft attitude. Investigators consider the most likely reason to be that they were sent during power-up after an electrical outage. At 08:19, the aircraft had been airborne for 7h 38min; the typical Kuala Lumpur-Beijing flight is 5hours and fuel exhaustion was likely. In the event of fuel exhaustion and engine flame-out, the aircraft's ram air turbine would deploy, providing power to various instruments and flight controls, including the SDU. Approximately 90seconds after the 02:25 handshake, communications from the aircraft's <b>inflight</b> entertainment system were recorded in the ground station log. Similar messages would be expected following the 08:19 handshake but none were received, supporting the fuel starvation scenario.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) demands {{compensation}} for her voice work in Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) pornographic video game, Gorgasm: The Legend of Dong Slayer. The argument escalates and Liz orders {{them to stop}} their bickering. After Liz leaves for Chicago, Jenna and Tracy decide to conduct a social experiment to see whether Tracy can survive better as a white woman than Jenna can as a black man, after arguing respectively that black men and white women have it harder in society. Later, while on her flight, Liz takes Jack's sedative. Liz realizes that the woman {{sitting next to her}} is Oprah Winfrey. When Liz arrives back at the 30 Rock studios, Tracy is dressed in female drag with his body covered in white makeup and soon after, Jenna enters in blackface and male drag. Jack worries that the situation has gone out of control, but Liz assures him that Oprah, who is coming to the studios, {{will be able to make}} them come to terms. As it turns out, her <b>inflight</b> conversation with Oprah was a hallucination. The person who Liz thought was Oprah is actually a 12-year-old girl named Pam (Raven Goodwin). Even so, Pam engages Tracy and Jenna in a heart-to-heart, and manages to settle their differences.|$|E
25|$|On 29 May 2013, KLM and Air France {{launched}} a pilot to test <b>inflight</b> Wi-Fi. Both airlines have equipped one Boeing 777-300ER {{of each of}} their fleets with Wi-Fi. Using the <b>inflight</b> Wi-Fi, passengers can stay online using their Wi-Fi enabled smartphones, laptops, or tablets. Wireless service will commence once the flight has reached 20,000 feet.|$|E

25|$|In January 2016 {{the company}} {{announced}} that delays had moved certification from 2015 to {{the first half of}} 2016, citing <b>inflight</b> ballistic parachute testing as one of their final tasks before FAA approval. In March 2016 the FAA announced that since the parachute system was not required for certification, the company did not have to conduct an in-flight parachute deployment demonstration, however, Business Insider released video in May 2017 showing the CAPS being tested <b>inflight</b> with a piloted SF50 prototype.|$|E
25|$|In the end, the Army {{decided against}} production, Thomas-Morse was {{acquired}} by Consolidated Aircraft, and the prototype was lost to an <b>inflight</b> fire.|$|E
25|$|On 14 May 1989, in the type's second fatal accident, Lynx HAS3GM XZ244, {{attached}} to , crashed near Mombasa, Kenya, while {{en route to}} the city's airport for a period of shore leave. A door had detached when opened <b>inflight</b> and collided with the tail rotor, resulting in the aircraft splitting in half and the death of all nine personnel on board. As a result, door modifications and <b>inflight</b> opening restrictions were introduced. As of 2004, it remained the deadliest Lynx crash.|$|E

25|$|In 1973, two ex-Blue Angels F-11As {{were taken}} from storage at Davis-Monthan AFB and {{modified}} by Grumman as testbeds to evaluate <b>inflight</b> thrust control systems. BuNo 141853 was fitted with a Rohr Industries thrust reverser and BuNo 141824 was kept in standard configuration as a chase plane. Tests of the <b>inflight</b> thrust reversal were carried out by Grumman at Calverton beginning in March 1974 and continued at NATC Patuxent River, Maryland until 1975. Following the completion of these tests, both planes were returned to storage at Davis Monthan AFB. These were the last Tigers to fly.|$|E

25|$|Caledonian {{sought to}} {{differentiate}} {{itself from the}} other UK independent airlines and US supplemental carriers with which it competed in the transatlantic closed group charter market by providing a personalised, high quality full-scheduled-service style <b>inflight</b> service that exceeded most contemporary scheduled transatlantic operators' economy class service standards by a wide margin. On a typical transatlantic 707 charter, there were individually printed menus. The <b>inflight</b> service began with tartan-clad cabin staff serving each passenger free cocktails from the drinks trolley at each seat row {{as soon as the}} seat belt signs were turned off. This was followed by the main meal, starting with a separately served hors d'œuvre before serving a main course of fillet of beef, Tournedos, lamb or a chicken dish, accompanied by a selection of complimentary wines. Thereafter, a dessert course was served, followed by a choice from a cheese tray and a basket of fresh fruit. The <b>inflight</b> service concluded with tea or coffee being served with complimentary brandies and liqueurs, as well as free cigarettes for those who smoked.|$|E
