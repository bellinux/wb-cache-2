However, {{even though there}} were thousands of people who were evacuating at the center, along with network newscasters, pleading desperately for help on CNN, FOX, and other broadcast outlets, FEMA head Michael Brown and Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff both claimed to <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the use of the Convention Center as a shelter until the afternoon of September 1.|$|E
5|$|On {{a mission}} on P4X-639, a planet {{experiencing}} strong solar activity, the SG-1 team encounters an alien archaeologist named Malikai (Robin Mossley). When a geomagnetic disturbance hits its peak, the Stargate activates simultaneously {{on the planet}} and on Earth, and a flash strikes Malikai, Colonel O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) and Teal'c (Christopher Judge) near an Ancient altar. Moments later, O'Neill finds himself in the Stargate Command (SGC) cafeteria {{in the middle of}} a breakfast conversation with Dr. Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) and Major Carter (Amanda Tapping), who claim to <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the planet. O'Neill and Teal'c later express familiarity with the events, and they are checked and certified to be in perfect health. Before SG-1 can resume their planned mission to the planet, an unscheduled offworld activation of the Earth Stargate, accompanied by flashes, transports O'Neill back to breakfast.|$|E
5|$|The {{capabilities}} and reactionary {{nature of the}} judges have been criticized. The main complaint reportedly made by Saudis privately is that judges, who have wide discretion in interpreting the Sharia, <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>knowledge,</b> and are often contemptuous, of the modern world. Reported examples of judges' attitudes include rulings banning {{such things as the}} children’s game Pokémon, telephones that play recorded music, and sending flowers to hospital patients. Saudi judges come from a narrow recruitment pool. By one estimate, 80% of the 600+ Saudi judges and almost all senior judges come from Qasim, a province {{in the center of the}} country with less than 5% of Saudi's population, but known as the strict religious Wahhabi heartland of Saudi Arabia. Senior judges will only allow like-minded graduates of select religious institutes to join the judiciary and will remove judges that stray away from rigidly conservative judgments.|$|E

Privately, the White House was elated by the coup, {{as it had been}} relatively bloodless.

25|$|During the Kargil War in 1999, Sharif {{claimed to}} <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>knowledge</b> {{of the planned}} attacks, saying that Pervez Musharraf acted alone. In 2008, Lieutenant-General (retired) Jamshed Gulzar Kiani— at that time Kiani was Major-general and served as the Director-General of the Military Intelligence— also {{publicly}} confirmed Sharif's statement of not having the knowledge on Kargil debacle. According to Major-General Kiani, General Musharraf had eye-blinded the Prime minister and did not brief him over the true facts or difficult situation which was faced by the Pakistan Army. During the Kargil debacle, the Indian Air Force's two MiG-29 intercepted the Pakistan Air Force's two F-16 fighter jets of the No. 9 Squadron Griffins, initially gaining a missile lock on these jets. This dogfight made a next-day morning headlines in Pakistan, prompting the prime minister to investigate the matter. However, Chief of Air Staff General Pervez Mehdi denied this incident, later accused the Prime minister for not taking the Air Force in confidence in the matters of national security.|$|E
25|$|Hughes Communications {{immediately}} {{noticed the}} jamming, {{and threatened to}} shut down HBO's satellite signal or alter the satellite's course, with executives believing the hacker was a domestic terrorist. HBO's technician, working at the company's communication center in Hauppauge, Long Island, telephoned Hughes Communications, but officials there could not offer an explanation to the jamming, and so he attempted to regain control by increasing the uplink transmission power from 125 watts to 2,000 watts. This was unsuccessful, as MacDougall increased his power in a control battle that lasted about 90 seconds, during which it was feared that a further power increase would damage the satellite. MacDougall got scared, abandoned his control of the satellite, and went home. The following day, he felt guilty about his actions, but hoped the jamming would not be noticed by anyone not working for HBO. MacDougall was later surprised to see his actions being reported on network television. Thus, {{when he returned to}} work that night he pretended to <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>knowledge</b> about the intrusion, and asked questions about what had happened. MacDougall only told close friends, and had visions about federal agents visiting his home.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} level of {{knowledge}} of the adolescent girls regarding reproductive health issues. Materials and methods: A cross sectional descriptive type of study was carried out among 150 unmarried adolescent girls of Vashantek slum in Dhaka city by face to face interview using a semistructured questionnaire from January to June 2008. Results: The {{mean age of the}} respondents were 16. 4 ± 2. 9 years ranging from 10 - 19 years. Out of 150 respondents, 130 had history of menstruation and their median age of menarche was 13 years. The correct knowledge was high among the adolescent having secondary level of education than the SSC and above or primary level of education and the difference was statistically significant (p< 0. 05). About three-fourths of the respondents had sufficient knowledge about hygienic menstrual practice. Majority of the girls could mention the legal age of marriage. Regarding the demerits of early marriage, majority mentioned some of the demerits but not all. Three-fifths of the respondents <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>knowledge</b> on importance of family planning and regarding the methods of family planning, majority of them <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Majority of the respondents heard the disease AIDS but regarding the knowledge on causative agent half of them <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>knowledge.</b> More than two-fifths <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>knowledge</b> on mode of transmission of AIDS. It was also found that majority of the respondents <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>knowledge</b> on symptoms of AIDS and three-fifths <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>knowledge</b> on prevention of AIDS. Conclusion: So formal, informal and special educational program may be taken to educate the adolescent girls on reproductive health issues and government should be more concerned about this. </p...|$|R

Neill, the acting Alamo commander, wrote to the provisional government: [...] "If there has ever been a dollar here I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>knowledge</b> of it". Neill requested additional troops and supplies, stressing that the garrison {{was likely to be}} unable to withstand a siege lasting longer than four days. The Texian government was in turmoil and unable to provide much assistance. Four different men claimed to have been given command over the entire army: on January 14, Neill approached one of them, Sam Houston, for assistance in gathering supplies, clothing, and ammunition.|$|E

Ava had been abducted months earlier, but claims to <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>knowledge</b> of her whereabouts during the time gap. Lily tries to leave the town, but is killed by an Acheri demon, prompting the others to seek refuge in a building, protecting themselves from the demon with barriers of salt.

500|$|... "Nobody Knows Me" [...] has vocoder effects, spacey synths, bubbly bass. IGN Music's Spencer D. {{described}} {{that the}} song blips, glurgs, and shuffles with a Jetsons' styled disco {{ebb and flow}} and sounds like as an outtake from Music (2000). It begins with vocoder treated vocals over a bleeping synth, on a minor chord. Heavy drum hits stress the melody during the verse. [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] is written in common time with a moderately fast tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of C major with Madonna's voice spanning from B3 to C5. The song follows a basic sequence of C–Am–D–Am–A–E as its chord progression. Lyrically, she rejects tabloid culture's [...] "social disease", denouncing both TV and magazines. The chorus features repeated echo shifts of [...] "nobody knows me" [...] while she ponders thoughts like, [...] "It's no good when you're misunderstood, but why should I care what the world thinks of me?". O'Brien {{described it as a}} trancey track with a sense of childlike defiant lyrics, dismissing critics who <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>knowledge</b> of her [...] "jealously guarded inner self".|$|E

Tess Mercer's death is ruled a suicide, and Lex sells the ownership rights to the Daily Planet. He also questions why he would befriend the [...] "unsophisticated" [...] Clark Kent, after reading some newspaper clippings.

In addition, there are remnants of memories left for Lex to continue his hatred towards the superhero but <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>knowledge</b> of Superman's secret identity. Lex later discovers that he once knew who Superman is and determined to remember. This leads to a proposal with General Sam Lane to create {{a joint venture between}} LexCorp and the Pentagon for the company's project, [...] "Guardian Defense Platforms", which involves monitoring the world's metahuman and extraterrestrial communities. In the second issue, Lex takes steps to regain his lost memories, having his assistant Otis Berg research the neurotoxin Tess used on him, eventually he discovers that the toxin has caused Lex's brain to operate at a higher percentage than normal, increasing his overall intelligence. In addition, Otis discovers that the toxin not only erased Lex's memories and enhanced his intelligence, but also caused him to mentally bond with Tess's consciousness when she poisoned him. Clark and Oliver eventually discover what happened to Tess, and extracts her consciousness from Lex and uploaded it into the Watchtower's computer until they can clone her a new body. It is also revealed that Lex was friends with Bruce Wayne, the secret identity of Batman, since childhood, but lost touch after the murder of Bruce's parents.
