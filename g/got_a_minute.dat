40|$|Asking for and {{providing}} help {{is a critical}} issue {{in the relationship between}} the learning disabled student and the learning disabilities teacher. The usual con-cerns of demonstrating academic growth often overshadow some of the subtle, yet very real, effects {{of the relationship between the}} LD student and the LD teacher. Dyer discusses some highly significant factors that the LD teacher should be aware of when help is provided to the LD student. It is suggested that LD teachers have a responsibility to monitor their involvement with the LD stu-dent so as to develop a relationship that facilitates, rather than impedes, the stu-dent's overall growth and development. - D. D. D. Those who work with individuals with learning disabilities belong to that large group of professionals often described as the "help-ing " profession. This includes teachers, coun-selors, therapists, social workers, nurses, con-sultants, etc. The essence of the work carried out by these "helpers " is ultimately to help others who interact with them. In this article I would like to explore some dimensions of the helping process as it relates to the learning disabilities professional. Being helped must always be seen through the eyes of the helpee, not the per-son offering the help; or, stated another way, the intention to be helpful is not enough. Help must be experienced as such by the one to whom it is proffered-or it is really not help. In the best sense, it is aiding another person to cope more adequately with conditions in his world. Asking for Help Two major conditions result in one person giving help to another. One occurs when a person seeks out another and says something like this: "Have you <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute?</b> I'd like to talk to you about a problem. " The request i...|$|E

2500|$|Tuncay {{returned}} from injury {{for the game}} at Anfield and scored after 9 <b>minutes,</b> but <b>a</b> terrible error from Arca gifted Fernando Torres a goal after 28 <b>minutes,</b> and he <b>got</b> <b>a</b> second <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> later. He completed his hat-trick in the second half. Downing <b>got</b> <b>a</b> goal back late in the game, but Aliadière was then sent off. This 2–3 defeat was Boro's first in all competitions since the New Year's Day fixture against Everton. Aliadière's red card was appealed against after the game, but it was dismissed and the disciplinary committee extended the ban by one game to four games as they branded the appeal [...] "frivolous", a decision which angered chairman Steve Gibson and Keith Lamb.|$|R

[...] and suiting the action to the word, he actually bundled the admiring Brother Burnham {{out on his own}} doorstep. There was a light pattering on the staircase, and Nellie Wynn, pink with sleep, very tall, very slim, hastily draped in a white counterpane with a blue border and a general classic suggestion, slipped into the parlor. At the same moment her father shut the door behind her, placed one hand on the knob, and with the other seized her wrist.|$|R
60|$|Guy Frapley <b>got</b> the ball, <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> later, {{and made}} a really fine run around the Lemington left end. This brought the pigskin again to center, and there it {{remained}} for nearly five minutes, the downs on both sides availing little or nothing. A scrimmage followed, in which one Lemington player was injured, and he accused one of the Oak Hall fellows, a new player named Bemis, of foul play. This protest was sustained, and Bemis was retired and another new player named Cardell was substituted.|$|R

It isn't five minutes' walk, and there's no chance of being booked there. Rot if someone was to come and stop it half-way through. It's in a field; thick hedges. No one can see. And I tell you what--I'll keep time. I've <b>got</b> <b>a</b> watch.

The chances are that he would not want to sing at all. The woman who really loved him would not encourage him to sing. She would want him to keep quiet while she moved herself about a bit, in case there was anything that could be done for him.|$|R
50|$|For {{most of its}} life, Classic Gold was {{produced}} with a presenter in Hull, and local 'tech-ops' in Bradford and Sheffield. In Bradford two sets of adverts would be played out - one for Bradford {{and one for the}} Halifax/Huddersfield transmitter. Tech-ops included Paul Bromley, Rol Hirst, Melanie Robinson, Richard Hizzard, James Cridland, Colin Bates and Peter Carter. Part of the tech-op's duties would also be to drive the desk for the news readers - the first three minutes of which were taken by the FM station, while Classic Gold listeners <b>got</b> <b>a</b> full five <b>minutes</b> of news.|$|R
50|$|The first leg, held in Gisborne, was an {{exciting}} if one-sided affair, with a high standard of play. Gisborne City's first goal came in just the third minute, through Fijian player Stan Morrell. Paul Nixon was the second to get {{his name in the}} scorebook, and at the break it was 2-0. Morell <b>got</b> <b>a</b> second ten <b>minutes</b> after the interval, but the last 20 minutes of the match saw a flurry of goals, with Johan Verweij reducing the deficit before two late strikes from Kevin Birch and Steve Sumner stretched the Gisborne tally to five.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{continued}} {{to assess the}} fifth season as the strongest. Varietys Laura Prudom called it [...] "arguably ... The Walking Deads best season yet, propelled by compulsive story threads and fascinating character dynamics" [...] as she commented on the episode as a whole saying: [...] "The weight of so many competing story arcs certainly brought a breathless quality to the finale — similar to Game of Thrones and that blockbuster show’s sprawling ensemble, each character probably <b>got</b> <b>a</b> cumulative five <b>minutes</b> of screen time while showrunner Scott Gimple worked to tie up multiple loose ends." [...] She also declared that Morgan's presence dominated the episode.|$|R
2500|$|It was {{a remarkably}} good aim if you {{consider}} that the bomb was fired 250yards [...] with no direct line of sight. Technically, it was quite brilliant and I'm sure that many army crews, if given a similar task, would be very pleased to drop a bomb that close. You've got to park the launch vehicle in an area which is guarded by armed men and you've <b>got</b> less than <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> to do it. I was very, very surprised at how good it was. If the angle of fire had been moved about five or ten degrees, then those bombs would actually have impacted on Number Ten.|$|R
60|$|The bell being rung {{for dinner}} at this moment, {{everybody}} ran away into the cabin, whither the Honourable Elijah Pogram fled with such precipitation that he forgot his umbrella was up, and fixed it so tightly in the cabin door that it could neither be let down nor <b>got</b> out. For <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or so this accident created a perfect rebellion among the hungry passengers behind, who, seeing the dishes, and hearing the knives and forks at work, well knew what would happen unless they got there instantly, and were nearly mad; while several virtuous citizens at the table were in deadly peril of choking themselves in their unnatural efforts {{to get rid of}} all the meat before these others came.|$|R

50|$|Stephen Rochford was {{selected}} as Mayo manager for 2016, and a poor league campaign nonetheless saw the side stay in Division 1 of the league for an 18th consecutive year. Going for a sixth successive Connacht title, hot favourites Mayo were shocked in the semi-final by Galway, who ran out winners 0-12 to 1-12. However, Mayo battled through the Qualifiers with unconvincing wins against Fermanagh, Kildare and Westmeath to reach a Quarter Final against Tyrone. In a tight game, Mayo won by a point 0-13 to 0-12. Surprise packets Tipperary awaited in the Semi-Final, which Mayo won 2-13 to 0-14 {{to set up an}} All-Ireland Final meeting with Dublin. The game ended in a draw, Mayo battled back after conceding two unfortunate own goals from Kevin McLoughlin and Colm Boyle. Cillian O'Connor <b>got</b> <b>a</b> 77th <b>minute</b> equalising point to bring it to a replay, the game finishing 0-15 to 2-09The replay ended yet another All-Ireland Final defeat by a single point. Cillian O'Connor had the chance with a free to bring the game to extra time in the 76th minute he missed it. It finished 1-15 to 1-14.|$|R
