40|$|The {{personnel}} administration process for <b>functional</b> <b>staff</b> follow bureaucratic procedures that is time consuming and {{often difficult to}} monitor. Further, the process will be prolonged if the process is handled manually. These conditions are often limit <b>staff</b> managers at <b>unit</b> level, technical implementation <b>unit</b> (UPT), or <b>functional</b> <b>staff</b> who need the information timely in a precise and accurate format. Manual handling cannot support the information speed, because staffs have to manually track file(s) or documents {{in the chain of}} bureaucracy that is complex and tedious. Delays in the process of obtaining such information could lead to adverse consequences in financial terms if for instance the termination in functional status and monthly salary occurred. One solution to this problem is to develop an online personnel information system (SIMPEG) to accelerate personnel information services. The Design of the online SIMPEG development utilized the method of open group architecture framework (TOGAF) while the system development implemented prototype method. Further the prototype is tested using developed questionnaires. In general {{the results of this study}} contribute to personnel information service acceleration. The promotions process (KP) was accelerated to 66. 67 % i. e. from 11 - 12 months to 4 - 3 months. Personnel time off and personnel reinstated (ABK) also accelerated by 66. 67 % that is previously taken 5 - 6 months to 2 months. While the process of scholarship approval was accelerated by 50 % compared to the old system which was 3 - 4 months to 2 month...|$|R

Next, we argue for protocol that builds up a <b>staff</b> <b>unit</b> {{to be held accountable for}} the management of such risks. Afterwards, the main components of the scoreboard are disclosed: on the one side, a governance-risk toolkit and, on the other side, policy-making guidelines, whose intertwining brings about a clinical approach to governance and the Governance-Risk <b>staff</b> <b>unit</b> report to the Board of Directors.

40|$|Restrictions and permissions in {{information}} systems [...] Authorization [...] can cause problems for those {{interacting with the}} systems. Often, the problems materialize as an interference with the primary tasks, for example, when restrictions prevent the efficient completing of work and cause frustration. Conversely, the effectiveness can also be impacted when staff is forced to circumvent the measure to complete work [...] typically sharing passwords among each other. This is the perspective of <b>functional</b> <b>staff</b> and the organization. There are further perspectives involved in the administration {{and development of the}} authorization measure. For instance, <b>functional</b> <b>staff</b> need to interact with policy makers who decide on the granting of additional permissions, and policy makers, in turn, interact with policy authors who actually implement changes. This thesis analyzes the diverse contexts in which authorization occurs, and systematically examines the problems that surround the different perspectives on authorization in organizational settings. Based on prior research and original research in secure agile development, eight principles to address the authorization problems are identified and explored through practical artifacts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Assuring {{quality is}} yet another {{challenge}} facing the leadership of higher education institutions. The extent to which this impacts staff depends {{on the extent to}} which they are made accountable. The drivers for quality assurance may be external, viz. institutional accountability to funding agencies or professional accreditation, validation or certification, or internal, viz. responding to institutional quality management requirements. A snapshot of quality assurance and management at a large multi-modal, multi-campus university is provided. The aim in this paper is to examine the role and expectations of <b>staff</b> development <b>units</b> with regard to institutional quality assurance. The paper will cover the following aspects, viz. quality assurance at New Zealand universities, quality management at Massey University and the role played in quality assurance by the <b>staff</b> development <b>unit.</b> In conclusion, the issue of the role of the <b>staff</b> development <b>unit</b> as a lever in quality assurance institutionally is raised. Although this paper will highlight the experience of one university, it typifies some of the elements affecting quality assurance and management. It is hoped that in the round-table discussion the following key issues will be picked up and point towards proactively strategizing responses to relevant and critical quality assurance challenges facing universities. Are <b>Staff</b> Development <b>Units</b> institutional levers for quality assurance? If so, what is the role of <b>Staff</b> Development <b>Units</b> in the quality assurance agenda? How is quality assured in <b>Staff</b> Development <b>Units?</b> What are some ways of measuring/evaluating quality and some strategies for achieving and maintaining quality...|$|R
