An experience on Swedish roads reveals that vehicles could be considered free beyond 6  s headway when interaction of vehicles is usually observed to be nonexistent [20]. Similar results were also obtained by couple of studies conducted on two-lane roads [21, 22]. Dey and Chandra [23] proposed two continuous statistical distribution models, gamma and lognormal for <b>desired</b> <b>time</b> <b>gap</b> and <b>time</b> headway of drivers in a steady car-following state on two-lane roads under mixed traffic conditions. Mei and Bullen [24] reported that in a car-following situation time headways are log normally distributed and converge to the shifted lognormal distribution with a shift of 0.3 – 0.4  s at higher traffic volumes. Kumar and Rao [25] proposed that negative exponential distribution adequately describes the headways at low to moderate flow levels. A relationship was developed between the proportions of vehicles in platoons and mean headways with an assumption that the vehicles travelling at headways less than 2.0  s are in platoons. A study on mixed traffic, however, indicates that at car-following state headway between two vehicles depends {{on the length of}} the lead vehicle [26].|$|R

Second, the lane-changing behavior is ignored to investigate the stability of the proposed model. Third, heterogeneous traffic conditions with ACC-equipped vehicles and human-driven vehicles is not considered in this paper. The fourth limitation comes from the same model parameter setting within a vehicle string in the simulation experiments.

Moreover, specific lane-change maneuver needs to be designed for SDM in order to improve the stabilization effect of autonomous vehicles on the road transportation system.|$|R

It is shown that the model is able to well reproduce (i) the free flow, synchronized flow, jam {{as well as the}} transitions among the three phases; (ii) the evolution features of disturbances and the spatiotemporal patterns in a car-following platoon; (iii) the empirical time series of traffic speed obtained from NGSIM data.

Although many methods exist for estimating covariate effects on <b>gap</b> <b>times,</b> very few allow for comparisons between <b>gap</b> <b>times</b> themselves. Motivated by the comparison of primary and repeat transplantation, our interest is specifically in contrasting the <b>gap</b> <b>times.</b> In {{the first chapter of}} this thesis, we propose methods to contrast <b>gap</b> <b>time</b> survival functions and their integration (restricted mean <b>gap</b> <b>time).</b> Specifically, we use Cox regression to estimate the (conditional) survival distributions of each <b>gap</b> <b>time</b> (given the previous <b>gap</b> <b>times).</b> Combining fitted survival functions based on those models, along with multiple imputation applied to censored <b>gap</b> <b>times,</b> we then contrast the first and second <b>gap</b> <b>times</b> with respect to average survival and restricted mean lifetime. Large-sample properties are derived, with simulation studies carried out to evaluate finite-sample performance. We apply the proposed methods to kidney transplant data obtained from a national organ transplant registry. In the second chapter, we aim at contrasting <b>gap</b> <b>time</b> hazard functions, assuming that the hazard ratio between two hazard functions is constant over time. In particular, we propose a two-stage procedure, wherein the first stage involves a Cox regression model on the first <b>gap</b> <b>time.</b> Weighted estimating equations are then solved at the second stage to compare the first and second <b>gap</b> <b>time</b> hazard functions. We derive the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators, and investigate their performance in simulated finite samples.

40|$|Summary. <b>Gap</b> <b>time</b> hazard {{estimation}} is {{of particular}} interest in recurrent event data. This article proposes a fully nonparametric approach for estimating the <b>gap</b> <b>time</b> hazard. Smoothing spline analysis of variance (ANOVA) decompositions are used to model the log <b>gap</b> <b>time</b> hazard as a joint function of <b>gap</b> <b>time</b> and covariates, and general frailty is introduced to account for between-subject heterogeneity and within-subject correlation. We estimate the nonparametric <b>gap</b> <b>time</b> hazard function and parameters in the frailty distribution using a combination of the Newton–Raphson procedure, the stochastic approximation algorithm (SAA), and the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The convergence of the algorithm is guaranteed by decreasing the step size of parameter update and/or increasing the MCMC sample size along iterations. Model selection procedure is also developed to identify negligible components in a functional ANOVA decomposition of the log <b>gap</b> <b>time</b> hazard. We evaluate the proposed methods with simulation studies and illustrate its use through the analysis of bladder tumor data...|$|R

We focus on the short-time dynamics of car-following models which describe continuous feedback control tasks (acceleration and braking) and models for discrete-choice tasks {{as a response to the}} surrounding traffic. The driving style of an agent is characterized by model parameters such as reaction time, <b>desired</b> speed, <b>desired</b> <b>time</b> <b>gap,</b> anticipation etc. In addition, internal state variables corresponding to the agent’s “mind ” are used to incorporate the driving experiences. We introduce a time-dependency of some parameters to describe the frustration of drivers being in a traffic jam for a while. Furthermore, the driver’s behavior is externally influenced by the neighboring vehicles and also by environmental input such as limited motorization and braking power, visibility conditions and road traffic regulations. A general approach for dealing with discrete decision problems in the context of vehicular traffic is introduced and applied to mandatory and discretionary lane changes. Furthermore, we consider the decision process whether to brake or not when approaching a traffic light turning from green to amber. Another aspect of vehicular traffic is related to the heterogeneity of drivers. We discuss a hybrid system of coupled vehicle and information flow which can be used for developing and testing applications of upcoming inter-vehicle communication techniques...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2015. Major: Biostatistics. Advisor: Xianghua Luo. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); ix, 80 pages. In many biomedical studies, recurrent events are frequently encountered where subjects experience an event repeatedly over time such as multiple infections after bone marrow transplant. The <b>gap</b> <b>times</b> between these recurrent events {{are often the}} natural outcome of interest. A {{number of studies have}} been conducted to describe the <b>gap</b> <b>time</b> distribution and examine the relationship between <b>gap</b> <b>times</b> and covariates. Despite rich literature, existing methods for recurrent <b>gap</b> <b>time</b> data commonly assume that all events are of the same type and thus that the <b>gap</b> <b>times</b> are identically distributed. In various cases, however, it is inappropriate to naively adopt this assumption. In this dissertation, we study two motivating datasets, the post-transplant infection data and the South Verona psychiatric case register (PCR) data, to which existing methods cannot be directly applied. We develop nonparametric and semiparametric methods to properly analyze these recurrent <b>gap</b> <b>time</b> data. In the post-transplant infection data, enrollment to the study is triggered by transplant, which is a different event than the recurrent infections. Applying existing methods to this data leads to incorrect inferential results because the time from transplant to the first infection and the <b>gap</b> <b>times</b> between successive infections may have different distributions. We propose a nonparametric estimator of the joint distribution of the first event <b>time</b> and the <b>gap</b> <b>times</b> between consecutive infections. Then, a semiparametric regression method is proposed to identify risk factors for infections, accounting for the potentially different distributions of the two types of time. Often times, recurrent events consist of two alternating states. The South Verona PCR dataset is a typical bivariate alternating recurrent event dataset, in which health care and break periods alternate during follow-up. Existing methods can analyze the <b>gap</b> <b>times</b> between consecutive contacts with health care services, but the break time is ignored, which wastes useful information carried by the duration of each state. We propose a semiparametric regression method for estimating simultaneously the relationship between covariates and the durations of the two alternating states...|$|R

40|$|In several time-to-event studies, {{the event}} of {{interest}} occurs more than once for some sample units, a feature termed recurrent events. The data for a sample unit then corresponds {{to a series of}} <b>gap</b> <b>times</b> between subsequent events. Most time to event studies only have a limited follow-up period, causing the last <b>gap</b> <b>time</b> to be subject to right-censoring. Compared to classical analysis, the <b>gap</b> <b>times</b> and the censoring times cannot be assumed independent, i. e. due to the sequential nature of the event times dependence is induced. Also, the number of occurrences may differ between sample units, making <b>gap</b> <b>time</b> data unbalanced. To unravel the association pattern of <b>gap</b> <b>times,</b> these data features need to be taken into account. The class of D-vine copulas serves this purpose and, moreover, captures in a natural way the serial dependence inherent in <b>gap</b> <b>time</b> data. One- and two-stage global likelihood based estimation are discussed. To reduce the computational demand, typically present for high-dimensional data, we introduce one- and two-stage sequential likelihood based estimation. In the two-stage procedures we discuss nonparametric estimation of the survival margins under dependent right-censoring. Our work thus extends existing work in several directions: for recurrent event time data, so far only the combination of parametric survival margins and the restrictive class of Archimedean copulas has been considered. Simulations in three and four dimensions are used to evaluate the finite sample performance of the proposed estimation strategies and to compare their limits and strengths with regard to diverse data features. The analysis of real data on recurrent asthma attacks in children stresses the need for flexible copula models as to detect a possibly complex dependence pattern.

Operating list start and finish times were poorly correlated at both hospitals (r 2 = 0. 077 and 0. 043), and cancellation rates did not increase with late starts (remaining within 2 % and 10 % respectively at the two hospitals). Start time did not predict finish time (receiver operating curve areas 0. 517 and 0. 558, respectively), and did not influence theatre efficiency (∼ 80 - 84 % at either hospital).

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a series of}} studies made in the field of modelling heavy vehicle behavior. The main goal of the thesis was to investigate how car-following behavior of heavy vehicles differs from that of cars, how external factors affect this behavior, and how to incorporate this knowledge into traditional car-following models. In a discipline where heavy vehicles have been neglected in favor of cars, an increased effort in research is needed to properly include heterogeneous traffic streams. However, any introduced complexity in the models should not increase the calibration demands. A large share of practitioners today spend too little time and effort on calibration, and increased calibration demands might increase this share. The main focus of the thesis is describing heavy vehicle behavior. Through three research papers and one paper describing a data set, several aspects of heavy vehicle following behavior are investigated. Previous work have shown that vehicle type of both leader and follower are important. Findings in the first paper indicate that only the follower vehicle type matters. A relationship between vehicle weight and <b>time</b> <b>gap</b> was found. It is also shown that both the threshold value for car-following behavior, and the <b>desired</b> <b>time</b> <b>gap</b> is different for cars and heavy vehicles. The behavior of vehicles differ from location to location, depending on properties of the road and surroundings. It is shown that whether a heavy vehicle is in a rural or urban environment in combination with either congested or free flow, will affect the behavior. For cars, the most important factor was the number of lanes. Weather also affects driver behavior. By measuring the speed and <b>time</b> <b>gap</b> in different weather and road surface situations, it is apparent that a snow covered road will reduce the speed and increase the <b>time</b> <b>gap</b> for both heavy vehicles and cars. Precipitation has a large effect on the following behavior of cars, but {{does not seem to have}} an impact on the behavior of heavy vehicles. These empirical studies required several data sets about vehicle behavior to be collected. The data used in the first paper was collected from a Weigh-In-Motion detector, and included variables such as <b>time</b> <b>gap,</b> speed, vehicle weight, vehicle length, axle weight, and number of axles. About 670 000 <b>time</b> <b>gaps</b> were collected from a rural two-lane road for the study. The data set used in the second paper consisted of about 21 million observations from 16 detectors at different places in Norway. They were carefully selected for studying the impact of road characteristics. For the third paper, about 70 000 joint observations from a Weigh-In-Motion detector and a weather station were collected. In the last research paper, Gipps’ car-following model was modified to have one common parameter set for all vehicle types, instead of one parameter set for each vehicle type. This was done by introducing a new parameter γ, a double exponential function of the gross vehicle weight. It was incorporated into Gipps’ model by multiplying it with the deceleration parameters of the leader and follower vehicle. The results showed that the measured <b>time</b> <b>gap</b> distributions had a slightly better fit to measured data in the field, despite less parameters to calibrate...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{impact of}} {{transfer}} batching (also {{referred to as}} lot splitting) {{on the performance of}} flowshops has received widespread attention in the literature. Most papers have emphasized the usefulness of lot splitting in cutting down average flow times, as it enables the overlapping of operations at different stages of the flowshop. However, as most analytical papers have studied deterministic flowshops, an important downside of lot splitting has until now been overlooked: i. e., the occurrence of idle times between the processing of consecutive sublots belonging to the same process batch (referred to as <b>gap</b> <b>times).</b> Clearly, <b>gap</b> <b>times</b> add no value to the product: they merely increase the process batch makespan at the different stages. In deterministic systems, these <b>gap</b> <b>times</b> may be avoided by synchronizing the processing rates of the different machines in the shop; in stochastic settings however, they may occur even when the system is perfectly synchronized, due to the inherent variability in the setup and processing times. Studying a two-stage flowshop with a single product type, this paper provides insight into the behavior of the <b>gap</b> <b>times,</b> and develops an approximation for the process batch makespan at the second stage in terms of the system characteristics and the lot splitting policy...|$|R

40|$|In this master thesis the {{possibilities}} of combining an adaptive cruise control with information about the road ahead has been studied. The focus has been to investigate the possibility to save fuel by using information about road topology, Look-Ahead. An adaptive cruise control, AiCC, is used when there are preceding vehicles and when the driver in addition to choosing a desired travel speed for the vehicle also chooses a <b>desired</b> <b>time</b> <b>gap</b> {{that is to be}} kept to preceding vehicles travelling slower than the own vehicle. Using information about the road ahead and information of preceding vehicles a controller with the function to adapt the speed to the preceding vehicle, target, {{and at the same time}} reduce the fuel usage has been constructed. The controller considers the topography on the road and the distance to the target to be able to reduce the utilization of the brakes in steep downhills and to reduce fuel by slowing down before the downhill and then gain speed due to the gravitational force. The controller uses the assumption that the target travels with constant velocity at all time. The work has included simulations with two different test roads, one in Sweden with shorter and not so steep downhills. The other road is placed in Germany and has long and steep downhills. In the simulations three various <b>time</b> <b>gaps,</b> 1, 2 and 3 seconds, has been used and three different weights of the preceding vehicle, 20, 40 and 50 tonnes. The vehicle with the controller using adaptive cruise control and Look-Ahead has a weight of 40 tonnes. The results shows that fuel can be saved, using information about the road ahead in combination with an adaptive cruise control. The best result is obtained when the road contains steep and long downills, where the vehicle will gain speed due to the gravitational force. For the long and steep downhills the result is best when the target weight is 40 and 50 tonnes. When the downhills are smaller and not so steep the best result is obtained when the target weight is 20 tonnes. For these downhills the assumption that the target travels at constant speed makes the vehicle reduce the speed too much before the downhill, not considering that a heavier vehicle will accelerate in the downhill as well. The <b>time</b> <b>gaps</b> that gives the best result is <b>time</b> <b>gap</b> 1 second. This is due to that the aerodynamic force acting upon the vehicle is reduced when there is a preceding vehicle at a not too far distance.

40|$|International audienceAbstractIn {{the risk}} {{analysis}} of sequential events, the successive <b>gap</b> <b>times</b> are often correlated, e. g. {{as a result}} of an individual heterogeneity. Correlation is usually accounted for by using a shared gamma-frailty model, where the variance φ of the random individual effect quantifies the correlation between <b>gap</b> <b>times.</b> This method is known to yield satisfactory estimates of covariate effects, but underestimates φ, which could result in a lack of power of the test of independence. We propose a new test of independence between two sequential <b>gap</b> <b>times</b> where the first is the time elapsed from the origin. The test is based on an approximation of the hazard of the second event given the first <b>gap</b> <b>time</b> in a frailty model, with a frailty distribution belonging to the power variance function family. Simulation results show an increased power of the new test compared with the test derived from the gamma-frailty model. In the realistic case where hazards are event specific, and using event-specific approaches, the proposed estimation of the variance of the frailty is less biased than the gamma-frailty based estimation for a wide range of values (with the set of parameters considered), and similar for higher values. As an illustration, the methods are applied to a previously analysed asthma prevention trial with results showing a significant positive association between the successive times to asthmatic events. We also analyse data from a cohort of HIV-seropositive patients in order to assess the effect of risk factors on the occurrence of two successive markers of progression of the HIV disease.

40|$|The orbit {{selection}} of telecommunications orbiters {{is one of}} the critical design processes and should be guided by global telecom performance metrics and mission-specific constraints. In order to aid the orbit selection, we have coupled the Telecom Orbit Analysis and Simulation Tool (TOAST) with genetic optimization algorithms. As a demonstration, we have applied the developed tool to select an optimal orbit for general Mars telecommunications orbiters with the constraint of being a frozen orbit. While a typical optimization goal is to minimize tele-communications down time, several relevant performance metrics are examined: 1) area-weighted average <b>gap</b> <b>time,</b> 2) global maximum of local maximum <b>gap</b> <b>time,</b> 3) global maximum of local minimum <b>gap</b> <b>time.</b> Optimal solutions are found with each of the metrics. Common and different features among the optimal solutions as well as the advantage and disadvantage of each metric are presented. The optimal solutions are compared with several candidate orbits that were considered during the development of Mars Telecommunications Orbiter...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} two {{driving simulator}} experiments on left turn gap acceptance at intersections. In the first experiment, participants (N = 24) {{had to turn}} left at 25 intersections and cross an approaching traffic stream of 25 equally-spaced vehicles, with a different combination of intervehicle <b>gap</b> <b>time</b> and approach speed at each intersection. In the second experiment (N = 20), <b>gap</b> <b>time</b> and approach speed differed also within each intersection stream. The first hypothesis that licensed drivers (who are assumed to have better perceptual skills) would more take into account approaching vehicles’ speed in their gap acceptance decisions than unlicensed drivers was moderately supported in the second experiment. Additionally, {{it was found that}} unlicensed drivers accepted significantly shorter <b>gap</b> <b>times,</b> significantly later in the stream of approaching vehicles. The second hypothesis that drivers who had higher self-reported violating behaviour (i. e., a poorer driving style) would be inclined to accept shorter <b>gap</b> <b>times</b> than drivers with a low violation score was not accepted. However, in the second experiment, drivers with higher violation scores were found to accept gaps that were earlier in the stream. In summary, results showed that both driving skill (i. e., having a driving licence) and driving style (i. e., violation scores) correlated with gap acceptance in a simulator. Some complicating factors, such as non-perceptual effects of driving skill, interactions between driving skill and driving style, and simulator fidelity, are discussed.

40|$|A natural {{choice of}} time scale for {{analyzing}} recurrent event data is the ``gap" (or soujourn) time between successive events. In many situations {{it is reasonable}} to assume correlation exists between the successive events experienced by a given subject. This paper looks at the problem of extending the accelerated failure time (AFT) model to the case of dependent recurrent event data via intensity modeling. Specifically, the accelerated <b>gap</b> <b>times</b> model of Strawderman (2005), a semiparametric intensity model for independent <b>gap</b> <b>time</b> data, is extended to the case of multiplicative gamma frailty. As argued in Aalen & Husebye (1991), incorporating frailty captures the heterogeneity between subjects and the ``hazard" portion of the intensity model captures <b>gap</b> <b>time</b> variation within a subject. Estimators are motivated using semiparametric efficiency theory and lead to useful generalizations of the rank statistics considered in Strawderman (2005). Several interesting distinctions arise in comparison to the Cox-Andersen-Gill frailty model (e. g., Nielsen et al, 1992; Klein, 1992). The proposed methodology is illustrated by simulation and data analysis. ...|$|R
40|$|First {{published}} online: 12 Dec 2014 In many medical studies, {{patients may}} experience several events during follow-up. The times between consecutive events (<b>gap</b> <b>times)</b> are often {{of interest and}} lead to problems that have received much attention recently. In this work we consider the estimation of the bivariate distribution function for censored <b>gap</b> <b>times.</b> Some related problems such as the estimation of the marginal distribution of the second <b>gap</b> <b>time</b> and the conditional distribution are also discussed. In this paper we introduce a nonparametric estimator of the bivariate distribution function based on Bayes' theorem and Kaplan-Meier survival function and explore {{the behavior of the}} four estimators through simulations.

40|$|We {{consider}} recurrent event data {{when the}} duration or <b>gap</b> <b>times</b> between successive event occurrences are of intrinsic interest. Subject heterogeneity not attributed to observed covariates is usually handled by random effects which {{result in an}} exchangeable correlation structure for the <b>gap</b> <b>times</b> of a subject. Recently, efforts have been put into relaxing this restriction to allow non-exchangeable correlation. Here we consider dynamic models where random effects can vary stochastically over the <b>gap</b> <b>times.</b> We extend the traditional Gaussian variance components models and evaluate a previously proposed proportional hazards model through a simulation study and some examples. Besides, semiparametric estimation of the proportional hazards models is considered. Both models are easily used. The Gaussian models are easily interpreted {{in terms of the}} variance structure. On the other hand, the proportional hazards models would be more appropriate in the context of survival analysis, particularly in the interpretation of the regression parameters. They can be sensitive to the choice of model for random effects but not to the choice of the baseline hazard function. postprin...|$|R
40|$|A computer-implemented {{method is}} {{provided}} for designing a restraint layer of an inflatable vessel. The restraint layer is inflatable from an initial uninflated configuration to an inflated configuration and is constructed from {{a plurality of}} interfacing longitudinal straps and hoop straps. The method involves providing computer processing means (e. g., to receive user inputs, perform calculations, and output results) and utilizing this computer processing means to implement a plurality of subsequent design steps. The computer processing means is utilized to input the load requirements of the inflated restraint layer and to specify an inflated configuration of the restraint layer. This includes specifying a <b>desired</b> design <b>gap</b> between pairs of adjacent longitudinal or hoop straps, whereby the adjacent straps interface with a plurality of transversely extending hoop or longitudinal straps at a plurality of intersections. Furthermore, an initial uninflated configuration of the restraint layer that is inflatable to achieve the specified inflated configuration is determined. This includes calculating a manufacturing gap between pairs of adjacent longitudinal or hoop straps that correspond to the specified <b>desired</b> <b>gap</b> in the inflated configuration of the restraint layer...|$|R
40|$|In many medical studies {{individuals}} can experience several events across a follow-up study. In these studies, the times between two consecutive events are often {{of interest and}} lead to problems that have received much at- tention. Most of the times, one will be interested in describing {{the distribution of the}} joint <b>gap</b> <b>times,</b> the marginal distribution of the <b>gap</b> <b>times</b> but also the correlation structure among them. In recent years significant contributions have been made regarding this topic. However, most approaches assume independent censoring and do not account for the influence of covariates.

40|$|<b>Gap</b> <b>times</b> between {{recurrent}} {{events are}} often encountered in longitudinal follow-up studies related to medical science, biostatistics, econometrics, reliability, criminology, demography, and other areas. There {{have been many}} models to fit such data, such as proportional hazards (PH) model and additive hazards (AH) model, among others. Standard partial likelihood can be employed to draw their statistical inference. The inference from a direct PH or AH assumption on the <b>gap</b> <b>times,</b> however, is less intuitive and straightforward than marginal rate modelswhich are often preferred by practitioners due to their more direct interpretations for identifying risk factors. In addition, the existing models have not adequately considered zero-recurrence subjects often encountered in recurrent event data. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose an alternative <b>gap</b> <b>time</b> model using an additive marginal rate function that accounts for zero-recurrence subjects. Local profile-likelihood is applied to estimate the model attributes, and the asymptotic properties of the estimators are established as well. The performance of the proposed estimators is evaluated by a simulation study. The proposed model is applied to analyze a set of data on pulmonary exacerbations and rhDNase treatment. 14 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{ignition}} delay <b>time</b> <b>gap</b> is newly studied. The operational characteristics of the linked two pyrotechnic thrusters {{are affected by the}} <b>time</b> <b>gap.</b> Although two thrusters are simultaneously ignited, the time at which the pressure starts to rise in each thruster may not be synchronized. The characteristic of the system with the <b>time</b> <b>gap</b> is compared with that of the fully synchronized system without any <b>time</b> <b>gap.</b> Depending upon the magnitude of the <b>time</b> <b>gap,</b> the pressure-time profile and the ballistic performance are different. When two pyrotechnic thrusters have a <b>time</b> <b>gap,</b> the peak pressure of one thruster(in which the pressure is built up earlier) is increased and the other is decreased. As the <b>time</b> <b>gap</b> is increased, the peak pressure is converged into the maximum pressure. This maximum pressure can be obtained when only one thruster is activated. Because the maximum pressure is bounded, it is predicted that there isn't any catastrophic failures in the considered system. When the <b>time</b> <b>gap</b> is relatively small, the impulse of the combined force acting on the moving body is almost maintained. But the ballistic performance of the system with a large <b>time</b> <b>gap</b> should be carefully estimate...|$|R
