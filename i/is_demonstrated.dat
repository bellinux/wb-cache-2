5|$|In 1036, Echmarcach {{replaced}} Amlaíb Cuarán's son, Sitriuc mac Amlaíb (died 1042), as King of Dublin. The Annals of Tigernach specifies that Sitriuc fled overseas as Echmarcach took control. An {{alliance with}} Donnchad could explain Echmarcach's success in seizing the kingship from Sitriuc. Although Donnchad and Sitriuc were maternal half-brothersas both descended from Gormlaith ingen Murchada (died 1030)Donnchad's hostility towards Sitriuc <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by {{the record of}} a successful attack he led upon the Dubliners in 1026.|$|E
5|$|Simeon {{turned the}} new Bulgarian capital Preslav into a {{magnificent}} {{religious and cultural}} centre, intended more as a display of his realm's heyday and as a royal residence than as a military fortress. With its more than twenty cross-domed churches and numerous monasteries, its impressive royal palace and the Golden (or Round) Church, Preslav was a true imperial capital. The development of Bulgarian art in the period <b>is</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by a ceramic icon of Theodore Stratelates and the Preslav-style illustrated ceramics.|$|E

These technologies include: (1) Polymer-clad TSVs with thick (~ 20 µm) liners {{to help reduce}} TSV losses and stress, and obtain optical TSVs in parallel for interposer-to-interposer long-distance communication; (2) Polymer-embedded vias with copper vias embedded in polymer wells to significantly reduce the TSV losses; (3) Coaxial vias in polymer wells to reduce the TSV losses with controlled impedance; (4) Antennas over polymer wells to attain a high radiation efficiency; and (5) High-Q inductors over polymer wells. 	 	Cleanroom fabrication and characterization of the technologies have <b>been</b> <b>demonstrated.</b> For the fabricated polymer-clad TSVs, resistance and synchrotron x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements have <b>been</b> <b>demonstrated.</b> High-frequency measurements up to 170 GHz and time-domain measurements up to 10 Gbps have <b>been</b> <b>demonstrated</b> for the fabricated polymer-embedded vias.

40|$|The {{aminopeptidase}} {{activity of}} arginine-utilizing mycoplasmas was investigated with 20 aminoacyl beta-naphthylamide substrates. High levels of arginyl-beta-naphthylamide hydrolysis <b>were</b> <b>demonstrated</b> in 6 of 11 species when extracts of concentrated washed organisms were used.

The procedure for preparing the extract of M. arthritidis appeared to remove the arginine aminopeptidase activity which <b>was</b> <b>demonstrated</b> to <b>be</b> present in the untreated culture. Fluorogenic and chromogenic tests were developed whereby this distinctive arginine aminopeptidase activity could <b>be</b> <b>demonstrated</b> within 4 h {{with the use of}} small volumes of broth culture (10 microliter) or single colonies, thus providing a rapid test for early characterization of some Mycoplasma species...|$|R
