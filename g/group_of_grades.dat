40|$|To {{extend the}} {{ecological}} validity {{of previous studies}} which focused on covert attention orienting by permitting participants to make eye movements to investigate the overt attention in learning disability (LD) groups and control groups, a cue-validity effect was hypothesized, with a general pattern of slower responses in the LD groups compared to the control groups. The classic cue-target paradigm {{was employed to examine}} the overt visual attention orienting in LD and control groups. Endogenous cue-validity was found both in the LD groups and control <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>grade</b> 3 and grade 6, with different magnitude, and it was the weakest in the LD <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>grade</b> 6; under shortest SOA, no exogenous cue-validity was found in <b>grade</b> 3, regardless <b>of</b> groups; when SOA was increased, the exogenous cue-validity was stable in all groups, with the weakest effect in LD <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>grade</b> 6. LD children who have attention deficit may partly come from ineffective use of the cued information, a generally slow cognitive processing speed, and a lack of proper cognitive strategies...|$|R

50|$|Each {{grade at}} FACE is {{typically}} {{divided into four}} groups: three of them French, {{and one of them}} English; however in some <b>of</b> the lower <b>grades,</b> due to varied numbers of students, there are sometimes two to three English groups or two to four French groups. When you get into older grades, however, that is no longer a possibility because of the lack <b>of</b> teachers. The <b>groups</b> are identified by the number <b>of</b> the <b>grade,</b> followed by E or F, for English or French, and then by a number when {{there is more than one}} <b>group</b> <b>of</b> its language (e.g., the English side <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>Grade</b> 10 is 10E, and the French side <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>Grade</b> 10 is split into 10F1, 10F2 and 10F3).
