40|$|A {{project was}} {{initiated}} at the Oak Ridge Y- 12 Plant to implement software geometric error compensation within a PC-based machine tool controller from Manufacturing Data Systems, Inc. This project {{may be the}} first in which this type of compensation system was implemented in a commercially available machine tool controller totally in software. Previous implementations typically required using an external computer and hardware to interface through the position feedback loop of the controller because direct access to the controller software was not available. The test-bed machine for this project was a 2 -axis Excello 921 T-base lathe. A mathematical error model of the lathe was created using homogeneous transformation matrices to relate the positions of the machine's slides {{to each other and to}} a world reference system. Equations describing the effects of the geometric errors were derived from the model. A software architecture was developed to support geometric error compensation for machine tools with up to 3 linear axes. Rotary axes were not supported in this implementation, but the developed architecture would not preclude their support in the future. Specific implementations will be dependent upon the configuration of the machine tool. A laser measuring system from Automated Precision, Inc. was used to characterize the lathe's geometric errors as functions of axis position and direction of motion. Multiple data files generated by the laser system were combined into a single <b>Error</b> <b>File</b> that was read at system startup and used by the compensation system to provide real-time position adjustments to the axis servos. A Renishaw Ballbar was used to evaluate the compensation system. Static positioning tests were conducted in an attempt to observe improved positioning accuracy with the compensation system enabled. These tests gave inconsistent results due to the lathe's inability to position the tool repeatably. The development of the architecture and compensation template will provide a baseline platform for investigating other types of error compensation in the future...|$|E
40|$|This manual {{describes}} {{the use of}} Program PitPro to convert PIT-tag data files in PTAGIS (PIT Tag Information System, Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission) to input files ready for survival analysis in Program SURPH 2. 1. This utility converts the various PIT-tag detections at the multitude of detector coils within a juvenile bypass or at adult counting windows and ladders into capture histories. The capture histories indicate whether a tagged fish was detected, not detected, or detected and censored at the major hydroprojects in the Columbia Basin. A major update to this program is the inclusion of adult upstream detection histories. Adult detection histories include not only whether the fish was detected or not but also the year of detection for proper adult survival estimation. The SURPH program is a valuable tool for estimating survival and detection probabilities of fish migrating in the Snake and Columbia rivers. Using special input data files, SURPH computes reach-to-reach statistics for any release group passing a system of detection sites. However, PIT-tag data, as available from PTAGIS, comes {{in a form that}} is not ready for use as SURPH input. SURPH requires a capture history for each fish. A capture history consists of a series of fields, one for each detection site, that has a code for whether the fish was detected and returned to the river, detected and removed, or not detected. The data, as received from PTAGIS, has one line for each detection with information such as fish identification (id), detection date and time, number of coil hits and detector coil ids, etc. Because an individual fish may be detected at several coils within a detection site as well as at several detection sites, each fish is often represented by multiple lines in the PTAGIS data file. For the PTAGIS data to be usable by SURPH, it must be preprocessed. The data must be condensed down to one line per fish with the relevant detection information from the PTAGIS file represented compactly on each line. In addition, the PTAGIS coil information must be passed through a series of logic algorithms {{to determine whether or not}} a fish was returned to the river after detection. Program PitPro was developed to allow the user to properly preprocess the PTAGIS data files for input to program SURPH through a user friendly graphical user interface (GUI). This utility takes PTAGIS data files as input and creates a SURPH data file as well as other output including travel time records, detection date records, and a data <b>error</b> <b>file.</b> PitPro allows a user to download PTAGIS files and easily process the data for use with SURPH.

Hence, a tool with electromagnetic sensors has first to be tested in different environments {{before it could be}} safely used in a surgical intervention.

These products are desirable for several hydrologic {{applications such as}} flood forecasting and rainfall-runoff modeling.

The nature of these uncertainties {{and their impact on}} the prediction accuracy of hydrologic models is not fully understood. The present study presents an analysis of uncertainties of operational radar-rainfall products and how they propagate into rainfall-runoff models. The study uses NWS Multi-sensor Precipitation Estimator (MPE) radar-rainfall products over the Goodwin Creek experimental watershed. Surface rainfall observations from a dense rain gauge network in the watershed are used to analyze error characteristics of radar products. MPE radar data are used as input to a fully distributed hydrologic model (GSSHA) to simulate runoff response during 11 storms recorded in 2002.
