The turbine wakes and the recovery of the mean wind speed between the turbine rows are derived from measurements of the velocity field using a portable meteorological tower with seven, vertically-staggered, three-component ultrasonic anemometers. The data provide insight to the blockage effect of both the individual turbine pairs within the array and the turbine array as a whole. The horizontal and planform <b>kinetic</b> energy <b>fluxes</b> into the turbine array are analyzed, and various models for the roughness length of the turbine array are compared. A high planform <b>kinetic</b> energy <b>flux</b> is measured for the VAWT array, which facilitates rapid flow recovery in the wake region behind the turbine pairs.

These interactions can be approximated using a vertical <b>kinetic</b> energy (VKE) <b>flux</b> method, which predicts that the maximum power generation potential is 26 % of the instantaneous downward transport of kinetic energy using the preturbine climatology. We compare the energy flux method to the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional atmospheric model equipped with a wind turbine parameterization over a 105 km 2 region in the central United States. The WRF simulations yield a maximum generation of 1. 1 We·m− 2, whereas the VKE method predicts the time series while underestimating the maximum generation rate by about 50 %. Because VKE derives the generation limit from the preturbine climatology, potential changes in the vertical <b>kinetic</b> energy <b>flux</b> from the free atmosphere are not considered. Such changes are important at night when WRF estimates are about twice the VKE value because wind turbines interact with the decoupled nocturnal low-level jet in this region.

40|$|Transverse {{stratification}} is {{a common}} intrinsic feature of astrophysical jets. There is growing evidence that jets in radio galaxies consist of a fast low density outflow at the jet axis, surrounded by a slower, denser, extended jet. The inner and outer jet components then have a different origin and launching mechanism, making their effective inertia, magnetization, associated energy flux and angular momentum content different as well. Their interface will develop differential rotation, where disruptions may occur. We here investigate the stability of rotating, two-component relativistic outflows typical for jets in radio galaxies. For this purpose, we parametrically explore the long term evolution of a transverse cross-section of radially stratified jets numerically With grid-adaptive relativistic MHD simulations, augmented with approximate linear stability analysis. We study the influence of dynamically important poloidal magnetic fields, with varying contributions of the inner component jet to the total <b>kinetic</b> energy <b>flux</b> of the jet, on their non-linear azimuthal stability. We demonstrate that two-component jets with high <b>kinetic</b> energy <b>flux,</b> and an inner jet effective inertia which {{is higher than the}} outer jet effective inertia are subject {{to the development of a}} relativistically enhanced, rotation-induced Rayleigh-Taylor type instability.
