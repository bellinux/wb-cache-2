5|$|The eye {{problems}} associated with the King Charles Spaniel include cataracts, corneal <b>dystrophy,</b> distichia, entropion, microphthalmia, optic disc drusen, and keratitis. Compared to other breeds, the King Charles Spaniel has an increased risk of distichia (where extra eyelashes or hairs cause irritation to the eye). Inheritance is suspected in the other conditions, with ages of onset ranging from six months for cataracts to two to five years for corneal <b>dystrophy.</b>|$|E

40|$|Corneal <b>dystrophies</b> {{refer to}} a group of corneal {{diseases}} and that are genetically determined. These have been traditionally classified with respect to the layer of cornea involved. We now know that this does not reflect the underlying pathobiology. Most of the corneal <b>dystrophies</b> are of Mendelian inheritance with some phenotype diversity and a variable degree of penetrance. The <b>dystrophies</b> involving enzymatic processes tend to be of autosomal recessive inheritance. In some cases, such as keratoconus, the inheritance pattern is not always clear and is considered complex. The age of onset of the disease, as in most inherited eye disorders, is variable and does not reflect the underlying pathogenic defect. Few cases are congenital. Our understanding of corneal <b>dystrophies</b> is undergoing somewhat of a revolution as over 12 chromosomes have been associated with corneal <b>dystrophies</b> with mutations identified in at least 14 genes if one includes anterior segment dysgenesis in this group of conditions. Several <b>dystrophies</b> remain without a gene or a genetic location (locus) and more familial studies are required. The new molecular information is challenging the traditional thinking about these conditions that was usually guided by the histopathological findings. As this new knowledge becomes more refined, the classification of this group of disorders will eventually be revisited to have a molecular basis. The elucidation of the underlying biochemical pathways may allow us to envisage the possibility of modulating these phenotypes in the future...|$|R

5|$|Secondary {{causes of}} tics (not related to {{inherited}} Tourette syndrome) are {{commonly referred to}} as tourettism. Dystonias, choreas, other genetic conditions, and secondary causes of tics should be ruled out in the differential diagnosis for Tourette syndrome. Other conditions that may manifest tics or stereotyped movements include developmental disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and stereotypic movement disorder; Sydenham's chorea; idiopathic dystonia; and genetic conditions such as Huntington's disease, neuroacanthocytosis, Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome, Duchenne muscular <b>dystrophy,</b> Wilson's disease, and tuberous sclerosis. Other possibilities include chromosomal disorders such as Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, XYY syndrome and fragile X syndrome. Acquired causes of tics include drug-induced tics, head trauma, encephalitis, stroke, and carbon monoxide poisoning. The symptoms of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome may also be confused with Tourette syndrome. Most of these conditions are rarer than tic disorders, and a thorough history and examination may be enough to rule them out, without medical or screening tests.|$|E
5|$|Various {{specific}} cases of animal testing have drawn attention, including both instances of beneficial scientific research, and instances of alleged ethical violations by those performing the tests. The fundamental properties of muscle physiology were determined with work done using frog muscles (including the force generating mechanism of all muscle, the length-tension relationship, and the force-velocity curve), and frogs {{are still the}} preferred model organism due to the long survival of muscles in vitro {{and the possibility of}} isolating intact single-fiber preparations (not possible in other organisms). Modern physical therapy and the understanding and treatment of muscular disorders is based on this work and subsequent work in mice (often engineered to express disease states such as muscular <b>dystrophy).</b> In February 1997 a team at the Roslin Institute in Scotland announced the birth of Dolly the sheep, the first mammal to be cloned from an adult somatic cell.|$|E
