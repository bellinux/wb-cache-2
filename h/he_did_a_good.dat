25|$|Day Two (13 March): Australia {{found the}} {{inspiration}} {{they needed to}} get back into the match via their great fast bowler, Dennis Lillee. He took the wicket of Mike Brearley straight away, and within half an hour, England had crumbled to 5 for 40. Tony Greig mounted a very brief counterattack, hitting three fours, but he succumbed for 18 (the top score of the innings) and the crowd were stunned and elated when England finished with 95 off 34.3 overs. Lillee dominated proceedings, capturing a personal best of 6 for 26, ably supported by the medium pace of Max Walker, whose four wickets destroyed the middle order. With three and a half hours to go, to be followed by three full days of play, Australia needed not only a big score, but a long innings to allow the wicket to wear and make life difficult for England chasing a big target. Australia promoted spin bowler Kerry O'Keefe to open the batting in place of McCosker and <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> job, lasting until the new ball lost its shine. But England struck a decisive blow after O'Keefe departed, removing the Australian dangerman Chappell for two and Cosier for four, leaving Australia 3 for 53. Opener Ian Davis was still at the crease and he combined with veteran Doug Walters to add a half century partnership in the time remaining before stumps, leaving the match evenly poised.|$|E

Vettel acknowledged {{the support of his}} team, saying the set-up of the car perfectly suited the way the race developed. Other drivers congratulated Vettel; Hamilton said that [...] "with all that pressure it is easier to make mistakes, and he obviously didn't, so congratulations to him. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> job." [...] The Grand Prix also marked the first win by Toro Rosso, the first non-Ferrari Italian-based team to win since 1957. Ferrari team principal Stefano Domenicali paid tribute to the team, who use Ferrari engines, saying [...] "They deserve it, they are close to us, and we are happy to work with them because we are giving them our engine." ...|$|E

Same happened with [...] "What You Won't Do for Love": Jackson said Yamin was sharp, Abdul liked it and Cowell said he was pretty good because the style suit him although it was not the best song in the world. After [...] "I Believe To My Soul" [...] Jackson said it was not the perfect song for him but he could definitely sing and <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> job, Abdul said nobody can sing songs like that like he did and called him a funky white boy again, and Cowell said Yamin is a great guy and a great singer and has made his mother proud, but also stated his song choices would not carry him through to the next round. Yamin was eliminated that week.|$|E

60|$|The major disliked this answer; and yet, {{when he came}} {{to reflect}} on it, as reflect <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal {{in the course of the}} day, he was {{dissatisfied}} with himself at being so unreasonable as to expect a girl of twenty-one not to think with her parents, real or presumed, in most matters.

60|$|Lafitte was a French blacksmith, and, {{while still}} a young man, {{he came with}} his two {{brothers}} to New Orleans, {{and set up a}} shop in Bourbon Street, where <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> business in horseshoeing and in other branches of his trade. But he had a soul which soared high above his anvil and his bellows, and perceiving an opportunity to take up a very profitable occupation, he gave up blacksmithing, and with his two brothers as partners became a superintendent of privateering and a general manager of semi-legalized piracy. The business opportunity which came to the watchful and clear-sighted Lafitte may be briefly described.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know as I'd say he {{was such}} a whale of a scholar. I've always had a {{suspicion}} <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal of four-flushing about that. He likes to have people think he keeps up his French and Greek and Lord knows what all; and he's always got an old Dago book lying around the sitting-room, but I've got a hunch he reads detective stories 'bout like the rest of us. And I don't know where he'd ever learn so dog-gone many languages anyway! He kind of lets people assume he went to Harvard or Berlin or Oxford or somewhere, but I looked him up in the medical register, and he graduated from a hick college in Pennsylvania, 'way back in 1861!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, what in {{the name}} of common sense," [...] ejaculated Captain Asher, [...] "did I think of that for? What has he to do with Olive, or Olive with him?" [...] And then he said to himself, {{thinking}} of the young man in the bosom of his family and without reference to anybody outside of it: [...] "Yes, his father must be pretty well off. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal more trading than ever I did. But after all, I don't believe he invested his money any better than I did mine, and it is just as like as not if we were to show our hands, that Olive would get as much as Dick's son. There it is again. I can't keep my mind off the thing." [...] And as he spoke he knocked the ashes out of his pipe, and began to stride up and down the garden walk; and as he did so he began to reproach himself.|$|E

60|$|But {{the next}} morning Lawrence arose very late. His coffee had evidently been warmed over, and his bacon had been cooked for a long, long time. The world {{did not appear to}} him in a {{favorable}} light, and he was obliged to smoke two cigars before he was at all satisfied with it. While he was smoking <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal of thinking, and it was then that he {{came to the conclusion that}} he would not go over to Midbranch and propose to Roberta March. Such precipitate action would be unjust to himself and unjust to her. In her eyes it would probably appear to be the act of a man who had been suddenly spurred to action by the sight of a rival, and this, if Roberta was the woman he believed her to be, would prejudice her against him. And yet he knew very well that these reasons would avail nothing if he should see her as he intended. He had found that he was much more in love with her than he had supposed, and he felt positively certain that the next time he was alone with her he would declare his passion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly you can, Mr. Masters. Tell {{him to come}} in {{and talk}} it all over with me. If we don't look to it he'll be taking to drink regular." [...] At that last meeting at the club, when the late squire's will was {{discussed}}, at which, as the reader may perhaps remember, a little supper was also discussed in honour of the occasion, poor Larry had not only been present, but had drunk so pottle-deep that the landlord had been obliged to put him to bed at the inn, and he had not been at all as he ought to have been after Lord Rufford's dinner. Such delinquencies were quite outside the young man's accustomed way of his life. It had been one of his recognised virtues that, living as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal among sporting men and with a full command of means, he had never drank. But now he had twice sinned before the eyes of all Dillsborough, and Runciman thought that he knew how it would be with a young man in his own house who got drunk in public to drown his sorrow. [...] "I wouldn't see Larry go astray and spoil himself with liquor," [...] said the good-natured publican, [...] "for more than I should like to name." [...] Mr. Masters promised to take the hint, and rode off on his mission.|$|E
6000|$|Facility and self-indulgence are {{the family}} marks; {{facility}} (to judge by these imprudent marriages) being at once their quality and their defect; {{but in the}} case of Charles, a man of exceptional beauty and sweetness, both of face and disposition, the family fault had quite grown to be a virtue, and we find him in consequence the drudge and milk-cow of his relatives. Born in 1766, Charles served at sea in his youth, and smelt both salt-water and powder. The Jenkins had inclined hitherto, as far as I can make out, to the land service. Stephen's son had been a soldier; William (fourth of Stowting) had been an officer of the unhappy Braddock's in America, where, by the way, he owned and afterwards sold an estate on the James River, called after the parental seat; of which I should like well to hear if it still bears the name. It was probably by the influence of Captain Buckner, already connected with the family by his first marriage, that Charles Jenkin turned his mind in the direction of the navy; and it was in Buckner's own ship, the Prothée, 64, that the lad made his only campaign. It was in the days of Rodney's war, when the Prothée, we read, captured two large privateers to windward of Barbadoes, and was [...] "materially and distinguishedly engaged" [...] in both the actions with De Grasse. While at sea, Charles kept a journal, and made strange archaic pilot-book sketches, part plan, part elevation, some of which survive for the amusement of posterity. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal of surveying, so that here we may perhaps lay our finger on the beginning of Fleeming's education as an engineer. What is still more strange, among the relics of the handsome midshipman and his stay in the gun-room of the Prothée, I find a code of signals graphically represented, for all the world as it would have been done by his grandson.|$|E

5000|$|A {{number of}} drivers defended Badoer's performance. Lewis Hamilton said: [...] "I think <b>he's</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> job. <b>He's</b> not {{put it in}} the wall. He's kept it on the track. It's an {{incredibly}} tall order to jump into the footsteps of Felipe Massa. He hasn't even raced for ten years, so I think anyone who has taken that long out of the car is going to struggle, but instead I think <b>he</b> has <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> job just to keep it on the track and bit-by-bit he will catch up". Heikki Kovalainen stated, [...] "I don't know what else you could have expected. Sometimes the tyres warm up, or they overheat or they don't warm up, and it's much more complicated than a few years ago where they brought out tyres that worked straightaway in different conditions. I think that knocks the driver's confidence very easily - if the tyres are not working 100 percent you can't push if you don't feel you have the grip".|$|R

He's never that way when <b>he's</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> day's work at his regular business. He takes to the children then, and has one glass after his dinner, and tells me all about it,--down to the shillings and pence. But it's very seldom he's that way now." ...|$|R
