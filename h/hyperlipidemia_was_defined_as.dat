40|$|The {{influence}} of drug concentrations {{on the development}} of persistent posttransplant hyperlipidemia was investigated in 82 patients who received cyclosporin A (CsA) and prednisone plus sirolimus (SRL) (52) or azathioprine (AZA) (30) during the first year after transplantation. Blood levels of CsA and SRL, daily doses of AZA and prednisone, and cholesterol, triglyceride, and glucose concentrations were determined during each visit (pretransplant and 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 360 days posttransplant). Persistent <b>hyperlipidemia</b> <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> one-year average steady-state cholesterol (CavCHOL) or triglyceride (CavTG) concentrations above 240 and 200 mg/dL, respectively. Mean cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations increased after transplantation (P 229 or > 274 mg/dL) and triglyceride (> 198 or > 282 mg/dL) determinations in the upper interquartile ranges. CsA and SRL interquartile ranges correlated with cholesterol concentrations (P = 0. 001) whereas only SRL interquartile ranges correlated with triglyceride concentrations (P 205 mg/dL was independently associated with development of persistent hypercholesterolemia (CavCHOL > 240 mg/dL, relative risk (RR) = 20, CI 3. 8 - 104. 6, P = 0. 0004) whereas pretransplant triglyceride concentration > 150 mg/dL (RR = 7. 2, CI 1. 6 - 32. 4, P = 0. 01) or > 211 mg/dL (RR = 19. 8, CI 3. 6 - 107. 9, P = 0. 0006) and use of SRL (RR = 3, CI 1. 0 - 8. 8, P = 0. 0049) were independently associated with development of persistent hypertriglyceridemia (CavTG > 200 mg/dL). Persistent hypercholesterolemia was more frequent among patients with higher pretransplant cholesterol concentrations and was dependent on both CsA and SRL concentrations. Persistent hypertriglyceridemia was more frequent among patients with higher pretransplant triglyceride concentrations and was dependent on SRL concentrations.

40|$|Abstract Background Multiple {{uncontrolled}} {{medical conditions}} may act as competing demands for clinical decision making. We hypothesized that multiple uncontrolled cardiovascular risk factors would decrease blood pressure (BP) medication intensification among uncontrolled hypertensive patients. Methods We observed 946 encounters at two VA primary care clinics from May through August 2006. After each encounter, clinicians recorded BP medication intensification (BP medication was added or titrated). Demographic, clinical, and laboratory information {{were collected from}} the medical record. We examined BP medication intensification by presence and control of diabetes and/or <b>hyperlipidemia.</b> 'Uncontrolled' <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> hemoglobin A 1 c &# 8805; for diabetes, BP &# 8805; 140 / 90 mmHg (&# 8805; 130 / 80 mmHg if diabetes present) for hypertension, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) &# 8805; 130 mg/dl (&# 8805; 100 mg/dl if diabetes present) for hyperlipidemia. Hierarchical regression models accounted for patient clustering and adjusted medication intensification for age, systolic BP, and number of medications. Results Among 387 patients with uncontrolled hypertension, 51. 4 % had diabetes (25. 3 % were uncontrolled) and 73. 4 % had hyperlipidemia (22. 7 % were uncontrolled). The BP medication intensification rate was 34. 9 % overall, but higher in individuals with uncontrolled diabetes and uncontrolled hyperlipidemia: 52. 8 % overall and 70. 6 % if systolic BP &# 8805; 10 mmHg above goal. Intensification rates were lowest if diabetes or <b>hyperlipidemia</b> <b>were</b> controlled, lower than if diabetes or <b>hyperlipidemia</b> <b>were</b> not present. Multivariable adjustment yielded similar results. Conclusions The presence of uncontrolled diabetes and <b>hyperlipidemia</b> <b>was</b> associated with more guideline-concordant hypertension care, particularly if BP was far from goal. Efforts to understand and improve BP medication intensification in patients with controlled diabetes and/or <b>hyperlipidemia</b> <b>are</b> warranted...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveStatins {{might have}} {{pleiotropic}} effects, independent {{of their ability}} to reduce lipid levels. Recent data have suggested that statins improve early survival and cardiovascular outcomes after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The effectiveness of statin therapy in normolipidemic cardiac surgery patients is as yet unclear. MethodsWe evaluated 3056 consecutive patients who had undergone cardiac surgery between April 2004 and April 2009. Perioperative statin therapy <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> continued treatment both before (≥ 6 months) and after the index surgery (included as a discharge medication). <b>Hyperlipidemia</b> (HL) <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> a total cholesterol level greater than 200 mg/dL within 6 months before surgery. Four groups were analyzed: (1) statin-untreated normolipidemic (NL−, n =  1052); (2) statin-treated normolipidemic (NL+, n =  206); (3) statin-untreated hyperlipidemic (HL−, n =  638); and (4) statin-treated hyperlipidemic (HL+, n =  1160) patients. Adjusted hazard ratios accounted for the known preoperative cardiac risk factors. Mortality was ascertained by retrospective database review and the Social Security Death Index. ResultsThe mean follow-up was 2. 2 years. The crude rate of 30 -day mortality was 3. 0 % (32 / 1052), 0 % (0 / 206), 8. 0 % (51 / 638), and 0. 7 % (8 / 1160) for the NL−, NL+, HL−, and HL+ groups, respectively. The overall all-cause crude mortality rate was 9. 6 % (101 / 1052), 3. 9 % (8 / 206), 17. 2 % (110 / 638), and 6. 5 % (75 / 1160) for the NL−, NL+, HL−, and HL+ groups, respectively. Statin therapy for NL patients undergoing cardiac surgery independently reduced the overall all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 0. 34; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 16 – 0. 71; P = . 004). ConclusionsPerioperative statin therapy was associated with reduced mid-term mortality for patients undergoing cardiac surgery, irrespective of their baseline lipid status. This clinical evidence suggests that the beneficial effects of statins might extend beyond their lipid-lowering ability...|$|R
