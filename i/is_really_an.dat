25|$|A fiduciary's duty {{must not}} {{conflict}} with another fiduciary duty. Conflicts between one fiduciary duty and another fiduciary duty arise most often when {{a lawyer or}} an agent, such as a real estate agent, represent more than one client, {{and the interests of}} those clients conflict. This would occur when a lawyer attempts to represent both the plaintiff and the defendant in the same matter, for example. The rule comes from the logical conclusion that a fiduciary cannot make the principal's interests a top priority if he has two principals and their interests are diametrically opposed; he must balance the interests, which is not acceptable to equity. Therefore, the conflict of duty and duty rule <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>an</b> extension of the conflict of interest and duty rules.|$|E
25|$|The points just raised are {{easiest to}} explain in reverse, {{starting}} from the motivation provided by surface theory. In this situation, although the planes being rolled over the surface are tangent planes in a naive sense, {{the notion of a}} tangent space <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>an</b> infinitesimal notion, whereas the planes, as affine subspaces of , are infinite in extent. However these affine planes all have a marked point, the point of contact with the surface, and they are tangent to the surface at this point. The confusion therefore arises because an affine space with a marked point can be identified with its tangent space at that point. However, the parallel transport defined by rolling does not fix this origin: it is affine rather than linear; the linear parallel transport can be recovered by applying a translation.|$|E

Rosebud is depressed because the Fairy Queen has {{told her that her}} incompetence can no longer be tolerated; unless she becomes more attentive to her duties of protecting mortals from demons, she will be sent to the back row of the ballet chorus. She had decided to protect and assist Aloysius Parfitt, a clergyman, and Jane Collins, a nurse. Jane has attracted the attention of Sir Trevor Mauleverer, a colonel in the Life Guards, who Rosebud believes to be a wicked baronet. Rosebud asks the demon to carry Jane off to Sir Trevor's apartment (making it look as if Sir Trevor has had her carried off) so that Rosebud can then rescue Jane and restore her to Aloysius. The demon is attracted to Rosebud and agrees. However, Jane is really Lady Angela Wealdstone, a lady of fashion, in disguise, and Sir Trevor <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>an</b> honourable man. Nevertheless, Lady Angela has run away from home to avoid being forced by her father into an arranged marriage with Sir Trevor.|$|E
500|$|Koechlin {{has been}} {{associated}} with theatre from a young age. As a child, she attended theatre workshops in Pondicherry. Her mother was adamant that she complete her studies before venturing into an acting career, sending her to London to study drama and theatre. During her years in the film industry, Koechlin has continued to participate in theatrical productions. She has written, produced, and acted in several stage plays in India. In a 2014 interview with Verve she said, [...] "Theater <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>an</b> actor's playground [...] There's nothing like performing for a live audience". Koechlin opened her own theater company, Little Productions in June 2015.|$|E

500|$|Willoughby's {{wardrobe}} {{was designed}} to reflect his [...] "poetic" [...] and [...] "fashionable" [...] nature, while Fordham believed Edward was more suited to the eighteenth-century rural colours. With Colonel Brandon being a stronger character, his costumes were halfway between the two. His clothes were designed {{to be out of}} date and firm, using more heathers instead of the rural colours. The production had an emphasis on youth and passion, which Clapton incorporated into her work. The designer said, [...] "Ten years ago, female characters in 19th-century dramas would all have their hair done in very precise ringlets, all neat and perfect just like in the portraits. Now we're trying to achieve a more believable, natural look, especially when the Dashwoods are at home." [...] She added that the director had wanted the characters to [...] "feel more human." [...] Morrissey commented that the period costumes were [...] "slightly uncomfortable" [...] for modern life, {{but as soon as the}} cast were riding horses or walking across fields, they realised why they were made that way. He added, [...] "When you're dancing, they're quite restrictive, but that's quite good for posture – posture was different then, and that's important. But they give you a feel for the character which <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>an</b> advantage to you as an actor." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{major theme}} of Austen {{scholarship}} has concerned {{the question of}} the Bildungsroman (novel of education). D.D Devlin in Jane Austen and Education (1975) argued that Austen's novels were all in varying ways [...] Bildungsroman, where Austen put into practice Enlightenment theories about how the character of young people can develop and change. The Italian literary critic Franco Moretti in his 1987 book The Way of the World [...] called Pride and Prejudice a [...] "classic" [...] Bildungsroman, where Elizabeth Bennet's [...] "prejudice" [...] against Mr. Darcy is really [...] "distrust" [...] and that she [...] "shes does not err due to a lack-but due to an excess of criticism, as Bennet rejects anything that she is told to trust a priori. Moretti argued that in a typical Bildungsroman of the early 19th century was concerned with [...] "everyday life", which represented [...] "an unchallenged stability of social relationships" [...] in a world that was wracked by war and revolution. In this sense, Moretti argued that the education that Bennet needs is to learn to accept the stability represented by the world around her in England, which is preferable to war and revolution to be found elsewhere in Europe, without losing her individualism. In the same way, Clifford Siskin in his 1988 book The Historicity of Romantic Discourse argued that all of Austen's books were Bildungsroman, where the struggle of the characters to develop was mainly [...] "internal" [...] as the challenge to the characters was not really to change their onward lives, but rather their [...] "self". Siskin noted in Henry Fielding's popular 1742 novel Joseph Andrews, where a young man working as humble servant, goes though much suffering, and is ultimately rewarded when it is discovered that he <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>an</b> aristocrat kidnapped by the Romany (gypsies) when he is a baby. By contrast, Siskin wrote that Elizabeth Bennet's paternity is not in question and there are not improbable stokes of luck which will make her rich; instead her struggle is to develop her character and conquer her [...] "prejudice" [...] against Darcy, marking the shift in British literature from an [...] "external" [...] to [...] "internal" [...] conflict.|$|E

2500|$|Another worker, William Ruddiman, has {{suggested}} {{a model that}} explains the 100,000-year cycle by the modulating effect of eccentricity (weak 100,000-year cycle) on precession (26,000-year cycle) combined with greenhouse gas feedbacks in the 41,000- and 26,000-year cycles. Yet another theory has been advanced by Peter Huybers who argued that the 41,000-year cycle has always been dominant, but that the Earth has entered a mode of climate behavior where only {{the second or third}} cycle triggers an ice age. This would imply that the 100,000-year periodicity <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>an</b> illusion created by averaging together cycles lasting 80,000 and 120,000 years.

2500|$|A more {{widespread}} hypothesis posits a Proto-Euphratean language that preceded Sumerian in Southern Mesopotamia and exerted an areal influence on it, {{especially in the}} form of polysyllabic words that appear [...] "un-Sumerian"–making them suspect of being loanwords–and are not traceable to any other known language. There is little speculation as to the affinities of this substratum language, or these languages, and it is thus best treated as unclassified. Researchers such as Gonzalo Rubio disagree with the assumption of a single substratum language and argue that several languages are involved. A related proposal by Gordon Whittaker is that the language of the proto-literary texts from the Late Uruk period ( [...] 3350–3100 BCE) <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>an</b> early Indo-European language which he terms [...] "Euphratic".|$|E

2500|$|The {{difficulty}} {{of this argument}} for some compatibilists {{lies in the fact}} that it entails the impossibility that one could have chosen other than one has. For example, if Jane is a compatibilist and she has just sat down on the sofa, then she is committed to the claim that she could have remained standing, if she had so desired. But it follows from the consequence argument that, if Jane had remained standing, she would have either generated a contradiction, violated the laws of nature or changed the past. Hence, compatibilists are committed to the existence of [...] "incredible abilities", according to Ginet and van Inwagen. One response to this argument is that it equivocates on the notions of abilities and necessities, or that the free will evoked to make any given choice <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>an</b> illusion and the choice had been made all along, oblivious to its [...] "decider". David Lewis suggests that compatibilists are only committed to the ability to do something otherwise if different circumstances had actually obtained in the past.|$|E

I know only how to reflect: I am a mirror [...] [...] [...] Logic does not exist for me. I float on the waves of art and life and never really know how to distinguish what belongs to the one or the other or what is common to both. Life unfolds for me like a theatre presenting a sequence of somewhat unreal sentiments; while the things of art are real to me and go straight to my heart." ...|$|E
