2500|$|According to Jackson Diehl, Deputy <b>Editorial</b> <b>Page</b> <b>Editor</b> <b>of</b> The Washington Post, the Bolivarian {{government}} of Venezuela shelters [...] "one of the world’s biggest drug cartels". There have been allegations {{of former president}} Hugo Chávez being involved with drug trafficking {{and at the time}} of the arrest of Nicolás Maduro and Cilia Flores' nephews in November 2015, multiple high-ranking members of the Venezuelan government were also being investigated for their involvement of drug trafficking, including Walter Jacobo Gavidia, Flores' son who is a Caracas judge, National Assembly President Diosdado Cabello, and Governor of Aragua State Tarek El Aissami.|$|E
2500|$|The {{condemnation}} of an Iranian Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani {{for the crime}} of adultery, with a sentence of execution by stoning led to calls for Lula da Silva's intervention on her behalf. On the issue, Lula commented that [...] "I need to respect the laws of a [...] country. If my friendship {{with the president of}} Iran and the respect that I have for him is worth something, if this woman has become a nuisance, we will receive her in Brazil." [...] The Iranian government, however, declined the offer. Lula da Silva's actions and comments sparked controversy. Mina Ahadi, an Iranian Communist politician, welcomed Lula da Silva's offer of asylum for Ashtiani, but also reiterated a call for an end to stoning altogether and requesting a cessation of recognition and support for the Iranian government. Jackson Diehl, Deputy <b>editorial</b> <b>page</b> <b>Editor</b> <b>of</b> The Washington Post, called Lula da Silva the [...] "best friend of tyrants in the democratic world" [...] and criticised his actions. Shirin Ebadi, Iranian human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner viewed Lula da Silva's intervention in a more positive light, calling it a [...] "powerful message to the Islamic Republic." ...|$|E
2500|$|Perdue {{began working}} on human rights issues in 2000, when he {{traveled}} to Cuba {{to report on the}} condition of ordinary Cubans and dissidents, publishing an article on the subject in Investor’s Business Daily. In 2008, he wrote a series of articles that were published in the U.S. and Peru concerning a Peruvian general that had been falsely accused of collaborating with narcotraffickers in the VRAE region of Peru, a notorious trafficking area. The exposé aided in the general's subsequent exoneration by the Peruvian Supreme Court. In 2009, he traveled to Honduras as part of the Washington Senior Observer Group for the historic presidential election as an international election observer. In 2010, he served as an expert witness in a precedent-setting human rights trial in the Miami Circuit Court, which prevented the extradition of a U.S. citizen to Argentina, the defendant’s native country. In 2012, Perdue began writing articles highlighting the abrogation of free speech in Ecuador, after President Rafael Correa ostensibly [...] "used the courts, under what could be considered dictatorial powers, to jail journalists for calling him a dictator.” Correa had actually sued the <b>editorial</b> <b>page</b> <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> El Universo, an Ecuadorian newspaper, for saying, in an opinion piece, that he was acting like a dictator. The editorial page editor, Emilio Palacio, was subsequently forced to seek asylum in the U.S. In 2013, Perdue attended the Human Rights Foundation’s annual Oslo Freedom Forum in Oslo, Norway, to interview Cuban dissident and leader of the Ladies in White, Berta Soler, and wrote an article for the Miami Herald on Soler and the racial discrimination suffered by Afro-Cubans under the Castro dictatorship. He also interviewed Tutu Alicante, a human rights activist from Equatorial Guinea, and published an article for the UK Commentator in London.|$|E

In 1983, he also worked as a producer on the ABC documentary The Crisis Game, which received an Emmy award in 1984.|$|R
