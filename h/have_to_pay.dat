5|$|Congestion pricing remains highly {{controversial}} {{with the public}} {{both before and after}} implementation. This has in part been resolved through referendums, such as after the seven-month trial period in Stockholm; however this creates a debate as to where the border line for the referendum should go, since it is often the people living outside the urban area who <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the tax, while the external benefit is granted those who live within the area. In Stockholm there was a majority in the referendum within the city border (where the votes counted), but not outside.|$|E
5|$|In 1664 {{the mill}} {{partially}} burned down. It was rebuilt and, {{in order to}} recover from the losses, the miller did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> taxes for the next 15 years. In 1764 another fire destroyed the entire mill, according to an ordenance from the States General after the miller requested assistance. The mill was rebuilt {{with the addition of a}} second water wheel. The larger building was a gristmill and the smaller building an oil mill. In 1909 a sawmill was added to the larger building, and for a period the smaller building also acted as a fulling mill.|$|E

5|$|The DAP also {{focused on}} landholding issues. Chong Chieng Jen, the {{director}} of the DAP's by-election campaign, pointed out that those who decided not to renew their 60-year land leases would have their land returned to the government without compensation, and that even if the government approved requests to have leases renewed, landholders would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> large premiums. Chong said that the DAP on the other hand wanted the current state land code to be amended to allow for the automatic and unconditional renewal of all leased land for a period of 99 years.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Ian Maxtone-Graham, though the {{original}} draft of the plot was much different. Originally, Homer was to learn {{that he was a}} Native American, and would try to exploit it to not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> taxes. The idea had been going well for a few days, but the staff did not actually know whether Native Americans had to pay taxes. When the writers found out that they did, the whole plot had to be scrapped. Executive producer Mike Scully's brother Brian pitched the idea of the trillion-dollar bill, which they accepted, as they were out of ideas.|$|E

Approximately 60 farms <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> taxes <b>to</b> an office in Eichstätt and 5 farms <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> taxes <b>to</b> the chapter of Eichstätt.

5|$|Tuition is {{paid for}} by general {{taxation}} in Germany, although only 27% of young people gain higher education qualification there, whereas in the UK the comparable figure is 48%. Fully or partly funding universities from general taxation has been criticised by the Liberal Democrat party as a 'tax cut {{for the rich and}} a tax rise for the poor' because people would be taxed to pay for something that many would not derive a benefit from, while graduates generally earn more due to their qualifications and only <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> them back.|$|E

In his first few weeks in Benghazi, he witnessed several protests against Gaddafi but relatively little violence. In addition, he saw people, including his teammates, gathering ammunition and weapons {{to prepare for the}} revolution.|$|E
5|$|After a {{long night}} of drinking, Homer and Grampa awaken and {{discover}} that they bought the pub from Tom O'Flanagan during the previous night's binge, much to their shock and dismay. They rename the bar and try to continue running it but get no business and {{have to find a}} way to market their unwelcoming business. Homer gets help from Moe Szyslak, who suggests that they allow people to do illegal things in their pub. They find out that smoking is now banned from Irish pubs and Moe urges the Simpsons to turn it into a smokeasy. They do a roaring trade, but are closed down by the Irish authorities. As a punishment, Homer and Grampa are deported back to America and <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> a small fine. Chief Wiggum arrives to bring them back to the U.S., but accidentally hits himself with his nightstick and then Maces and Tasers himself.|$|E

5|$|After {{construction}} of the Skinners FallsMilanville Bridge was completed in late 1902, tolls were immediately charged along the one lane structure. However, unlike the other two bridges, the Skinners FallsMilanville Bridge cost $0.22 (1902 USD). A person traveling on foot did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> to cross the structure. This decision was different {{compared to the other}} bridges, which made it separate. Another decision was that ministers were not tolled so they could better serve their communities. However, when one minister began to abuse the special privilege, he was charged $0.05 for crossing. The tollhouse for collection was in Milanville and was run by the Dexter family.|$|E
5|$|An {{agreement}} was {{made between the}} ministry, the tunnel company and the county municipality on 6 January 1994 to build the tunnel.

The construction would be the responsibility of Hordaland Public Roads Administration, with the tunnel company only responsible for their part of the financing and the collection of tolls. An {{agreement was}} made with Selmer, whereby they would charge NOK59,422,500 and take the risk of the project, including any expenditures for unknown geological conditions or similar costs increases. They were also responsible for an insurance to reclaim the investments should it be proven impossible to build the tunnel.|$|E
5|$|By September 25, 24 {{exhibition}} {{games were}} canceled and training camps were postponed indefinitely {{as a result}} of stalled talks.

The season's first two weeks were officially canceled on October 13, and 99 games scheduled for November were lost as a result. It {{was the first time in}} NBA history that games were canceled due to a labor dispute. On October 20, arbitrator John Feerick ruled that the owners did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> players with guaranteed contracts during the lockout. Feerick's decision gave the owners leverage in bargaining talks. Another factor favoring the owners was that their teams received money from the NBA's television broadcasters, whose contracts with the league called for payments to be made if games were not played.|$|E
