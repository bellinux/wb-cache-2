5|$|The {{game was}} played in {{extremely}} cold and icy conditions, still the worst in Sun Bowl history. Three inches of snow fell {{on top of a}} layer of frozen rain the day before the game, and at kickoff the teams took the field under cloudy skies and in below-freezing temperatures. Despite the inclement weather, 15,000-seat Kidd Field was approximately <b>half</b> <b>full,</b> and bowl officials estimated the crowd at around 10,000 people.|$|E
5|$|During the 2007 NBA All-Star Weekend, Bavetta raced Turner Network Television (TNT) studio {{analyst and}} former NBA player Charles Barkley for a $75,000 {{charitable}} donation ($50,000 contributed by the NBA and $25,000 by TNT) to the Las Vegas Boys & Girls Clubs of America, but lost {{by a narrow}} margin. The distance of the race was three and one <b>half</b> <b>full</b> lengths of the court (or 329feet). Bavetta lost the race despite a last-second dive and Barkley running the last portion of the race backwards. The dive resulted in an abrasion injury to Bavetta's right knee.|$|E

5|$|In {{its early}} years, the congregation's {{financial}} situation was precarious. The building was located ten blocks from {{where most of}} the congregants and potential congregants lived (on Grand Street, near the ferry docks), and attendance was low. Even on the High Holy Days, the sanctuary was rarely more than <b>half</b> <b>full.</b> The synagogue employed a rabbi, gabbai, and cantor, and annual expenses often exceeded the congregation's income (which came primarily from the sale of seats). To remain solvent, the congregation borrowed money against the equity in the building: $2,000 (today $) in 1888, and another $2,000 in 1894.|$|E
5|$|Ruthenium is {{the first}} in a {{downward}} trend in the melting and boiling points and atomization enthalpy in the 4d transition metals after the maximum seen at molybdenum, because the 4d subshell is more than <b>half</b> <b>full</b> and the electrons are contributing less to metallic bonding. (Technetium, the previous element, has an exceptionally low value that is off the trend due to its half-filled 4d55s2 configuration, though the small amount of energy needed to excite it to a 4d65s1 configuration indicates that it is not as far off the trend in the 4d series as manganese in the 3d transition series.) Unlike the lighter congener iron, ruthenium is paramagnetic at room temperature, as iron also is above its Curie point.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with wind}} direction, cloud cover {{is one of}} the oldest {{atmospheric}} conditions to be coded on a station model. The circle in the middle of the station model represents cloud cover. In the United Kingdom, when the observation is taken from an automated weather observation site, the shape is a triangle. If the shape is completely filled in, it is overcast. If conditions are completely clear, the circle or triangle is empty. If conditions are partly cloudy, the circle or triangle is partially filled in. The cloud cover shape has different looks depending upon how many oktas (eighths of the sky) are covered by cloud. A sky <b>half</b> <b>full</b> of clouds would have a circle that was half white and half black. Below the shape indicating sky cover, the station model can indicate the coverage of low clouds, in oktas, and the ceiling height in hundreds of feet. The ceiling height is the height at which more than half the sky is covered by clouds.|$|E

5|$|Gateshead International Stadium {{has been}} used for many years as a concert venue. On 31 July 1982, The Police {{performed}} at the stadium as part of their Ghost in the Machine Tour, with U2 as a supporting act. Reports in the local press suggested that The Police seemed disappointed that the stadium was only <b>half</b> <b>full</b> and cited high ticket prices and poor weather as possible causes. On 16 June 1992 Guns N' Roses, supported by Soundgarden and Faith No More, performed at the stadium. This time the weather was hot and sunny which helped ensure that the concert, part of the Use Your Illusion Tour, was a sell-out. American rock group Bon Jovi have played twice at the stadium. The first occasion was on 27 June 1995, while supported by Skin, on their These Days Tour. The group returned to Gateshead on 22 August 2000 as part of their Crush Tour. Another artist who has performed multiple times at Gateshead International Stadium is Tina Turner. As part of her , Turner performed twice on consecutive nights (2122 July 1990) and attracted a total of 60,000 spectators. Turner performed for a third time at the stadium as part of her Wildest Dreams Tour on 12 July 1996. Other artists to have played at the stadium include Bryan Adams, Rod Stewart, Simple Minds and Simply Red.|$|E
5|$|If {{the player}} {{successfully}} matches {{a number of}} consecutive notes correctly, they boost their individual scoring multiplier up to a maximum 4x value; missing a note will reset to the multiplier back to 1x. Throughout each song's respective charts for the instruments are special highlighted phrases; completing all the notes in this phrase, and for guitar/bass players, using the whammy bar on marked sustained notes, fills part of a Star Power meter. When this meter is at least <b>half</b> <b>full,</b> the player can activate Star Power by performing special actions on their controllers: either tilting the guitar controller upward briefly or pressing the Star Power activation button for guitar and bass; striking two pads simultaneously on the drums; and either double tapping the microphone or pressing one of the buttons on the game console's regular controllers for vocals. When Star Power is activated, the overall band scoring multiplier is increased for a limited time until the Star Power meter is drained. After completing a song, the band is awarded a number of stars based on the overall score; in normal modes for Warriors of Rock, up to six stars can be earned; the final being achievable only through zero misses and zero extra strums.|$|E

25|$|The oxygen {{tank was}} redesigned, with the {{thermostats}} upgraded {{to handle the}} proper voltage. The heaters were retained since they were necessary to maintain oxygen pressure. The stirring fans, with their unsealed motors, were removed, which meant the oxygen quantity gauge was no longer accurate.

25|$|Tumbling is an {{economical}} {{finishing process}} because large batches of parts can be run {{with little or}} no supervision by the operator. A full cycle can take anywhere from 6 to 24 hours with the barrel turning at 20 to 38RPM. Tumbling is usually most efficient with the barrel <b>half</b> <b>full.</b> Some processes also use a filter system to allow parts or other materials in the cylinder to be separated.|$|E

25|$|On 16 November 1943, the Allied {{air forces}} dropped more than 400 bombs on the site.

On 20 February 1944, a Norwegian partisan sank the ferry M/FHydro carrying heavy water across Lake Tinn, {{at the cost}} of 14 Norwegian civilian lives, and most of the heavy water was presumably lost. A few of the barrels were only <b>half</b> <b>full,</b> and therefore could float, and may have been salvaged and transported to Germany.|$|E
25|$|Barrel {{burnishing}} {{is a type}} of barreling {{where no}} cutting action is desired. The goal is to reduce minute irregularities and produce a clean, smooth surface. The parts are usually tumbled against themselves or with steel balls, shot, rounded-end pins, or ballcones to achieve this. It is also usually a wet process that uses water and a lubricant or cleaning agent, such as soap or cream of tartar. The barrel is not loaded more than <b>half</b> <b>full</b> and if media is used then a 2:1 ratio of media to parts is maintained to keep the parts from rubbing.|$|E
