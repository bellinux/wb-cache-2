5|$|The Poitevin breed {{was created}} in the marshes of the Poitou region, <b>especially</b> <b>around</b> Luçon, La Rochelle, Melle and Niort.

Although described as a draft horse, it was not selected for draft purposes, and was never popular for that use.|$|E
5|$|The two-storey {{house and}} the chapel are built of the local Blue Lias stone. Parts of the house have mellow honey-coloured Hamstone dressings, <b>especially</b> <b>around</b> windows and at quoins; the later 18th century {{additions}} have brick dressings. The roofs are stone tiled with some later terracotta tiles.|$|E
5|$|Zennor Head {{is home to}} {{a variety}} of wildlife, {{including}} the Cornish chough (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax). Grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) have been sighted off the coast. Many seabirds nest on the cliffs, <b>especially</b> <b>around</b> Horseback Zawn, including herring gulls (Larus argentatus) and fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis).

5|$|Areas of {{the coast}} near Exmouth, The Fleet at Weymouth and the beaches at Studland have also been used for {{training}} for war, but have since been returned to civilian use. Parts {{of the coast}}, <b>especially</b> <b>around</b> Portland, can be dangerous, and shipwrecks have been {{a feature of the}} coast.

5|$|By 1916, most of Western Armenia was {{occupied}} by the Russian Empire {{as part of the}} Caucasian Campaign of World War I. In parts of the occupied areas, <b>especially</b> <b>around</b> Van, an Armenian autonomy was briefly set up. The Russian army left the region due to the Revolution of 1917. The Ottoman Empire quickly regained the territories from the small number of irregular Armenian units. In the Caucasus, the Special Transcaucasian Committee was set up after the February Revolution.|$|E
5|$|In the {{meantime}} fighting between the rebels and the Byzantines continued. Although the Bulgarian forces were cut in two following the Byzantine landing at Varna, heavy clashes {{erupted in the}} eastern Balkan mountains with new vigour, <b>especially</b> <b>around</b> the Kotel Pass and the Varbitsa Pass. The Bulgarian positions there were surrounded both {{from the north and}} the south. The Byzantines had to besiege and take the fortresses one by one which cost time and casualties. Many strongholds remained unconquered and permanently engaged large Byzantine forces.|$|E

Appendix II lists species that are not necessarily threatened with extinction currently, but may become so unless trade is closely controlled.|$|E
5|$|Montejo {{immediately}} {{sought to}} curb the worst excesses of the Spanish, and impressed upon the colonists the need to treat the natives fairly, and within the law. He sent many of the Achi Maya auxiliaries back to Guatemala due to their depredations among the generally peaceful Chontal Maya of the Sula littoral. The moderation of Montejo's actions encouraged considerable numbers of natives {{to return to their}} villages, <b>especially</b> <b>around</b> Gracias a Dios, and the encomienda system began to function as was intended, which greatly alleviated the constant struggle for provisions.|$|E
5|$|Pushkar Lake is {{surrounded}} by 52 bathing ghats (a series of steps leading to the lake), where pilgrims throng in large numbers to take a sacred bath, <b>especially</b> <b>around</b> Kartik Poornima (October–November) when the Pushkar Fair is held.

The monitoring post for Mount Tambora is located at Doro Peti village. They use a seismograph to measure seismic and tectonic activity. Since the 1880 eruption, no significant increase in seismic activity has occurred. Monitoring is performed continuously inside the caldera, <b>especially</b> <b>around</b> the Doro Api Toi parasitic cone.|$|E
5|$|The road {{has long}} {{served as a}} de facto {{cultural}} dividing line between the predominantly poor black city and its wealthier, predominantly white northern suburbs. The perception of 8Mile as the chief dividing line between racial groups and classes persists, {{in part because the}} suburban counties of Oakland and Macomb remain, on the whole, significantly whiter and more prosperous than the city of Detroit. However, in recent years increasing numbers of whites have moved into Detroit, <b>especially</b> <b>around</b> the downtown area, and other neighborhoods in the region have become more ethnically diverse as well.|$|E
5|$|Added to {{the state}} highway system in 1933, and defined in 1935, Route198 {{extended}} from US 80 onto La Mesa Boulevard and Palm Avenue to SR94 by 1938. In 1947, the San Diego County Highway Development Association requested that the highway from Sixth Avenue in Mission Valley to US 80 be constructed as a freeway. Although state senator Fred Kraft criticized the proposal in July 1953 because he believed {{that it would be}} too expensive and would not reduce congestion in the long-term, <b>especially</b> <b>around</b> the junction with US 80 in Grossmont, approval for the Route 94 freeway extended to the junction with U.S. Route 80 (US80) by October, with the Grossmont part of the route signed as Route 67. The Route 67 freeway was completed in March 1957, from Campo Road and Route 94 to US 80; the project was completed for $1,625,000.|$|E

5|$|An {{irregular}} {{chain of}} mountains, hills, and plateaus {{known as the}} Cameroon range extends from Mount Cameroon on the coast—Cameroon's highest point at —almost to Lake Chad at Cameroon's northern border at 13°05'N. This region has a mild climate, particularly on the Western High Plateau, although rainfall is high. Its soils are among Cameroon's most fertile, <b>especially</b> <b>around</b> volcanic Mount Cameroon. Volcanism here has created crater lakes. On 21 August 1986, one of these, Lake Nyos, belched carbon dioxide and killed between 1,700 and 2,000 people. This area has been delineated by the World Wildlife Fund as the Cameroonian Highlands forests ecoregion.|$|E
5|$|Blood {{lead levels}} are an {{indicator}} mainly of recent or current lead exposure, not of total body burden. Lead in bones {{can be measured}} noninvasively by X-ray fluorescence; {{this may be the}} best measure of cumulative exposure and total body burden. However this method is not widely available and is mainly used for research rather than routine diagnosis. Another radiographic sign of elevated lead levels is the presence of radiodense lines called lead lines at the metaphysis in the long bones of growing children, <b>especially</b> <b>around</b> the knees. These lead lines, caused by increased calcification due to disrupted metabolism in the growing bones, become wider as the duration of lead exposure increases. X-rays may also reveal lead-containing foreign materials such as paint chips in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
5|$|Citibase Brighton (previously {{known as}} The Brighton Forum by Topcentre) {{is a complex}} of {{serviced}} offices on a prominent elevated position in the Round Hill area of Brighton, part of the English city of Brighton and Hove. The large Gothic Revival building, by two architect brothers from London, has had three greatly different uses since its construction {{at the edge of}} Brighton parish in 1854: for its first 85 years, it trained Anglican schoolmistresses; then it became a military base and records office; and in 1988 it opened as a multipurpose business centre and office complex. The elaborate flint exterior is finely detailed in the Gothic style, <b>especially</b> <b>around</b> the windows. English Heritage has listed it at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance.|$|E
