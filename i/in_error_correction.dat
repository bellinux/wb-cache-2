50|$|In modern digital communications, Gray codes play an {{important}} role <b>in</b> <b>error</b> <b>correction.</b> For example, in a digital modulation scheme such as QAM where data is typically transmitted in symbols of 4 bits or more, the signal's constellation diagram is arranged so that the bit patterns conveyed by adjacent constellation points differ by only one bit. By combining this with forward error correction capable of correcting single-bit errors, it is possible for a receiver to correct any transmission errors that cause a constellation point to deviate into the area of an adjacent point. This makes the transmission system less susceptible to noise.|$|E

An fMRI study done in 2009 by Laute et al. examined the neural activation patterns associated with the error correction phase of prism adaptation and found that the left anterior intraparietal sulcus was activated proportional to pointing deviation, and its activation gradually decreased with adaptation, while an increase in activation of the parieto-occipital sulcus was observed as movement plans were adjusted on a trial-by-trial basis. It was suggested that the intraparietal sulcus is involved in error detection whereas the parieto-occipital sulcus is involved <b>in</b> <b>error</b> <b>correction.</b> Another fMRI study done in 2010 by Chapman et al. found that the neural mechanisms underlying the later, spatial realignment phase of prism adaptation recruited the right cerebellum and inferior parietal lobule.|$|E

30|$|Random <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> a Galois field (row 8) and the {{additive}} {{impulsive noise}} <b>in</b> real-field <b>error</b> <b>correction</b> codes (row 9) are sparse disturbances {{that need to}} be detected and removed. For erasure channels, the impulsive noise can be regarded as the negative of the missing sample value [31]; thus the missing sampling problem, which can also be regarded as a special case of nonuniform sampling, is also a special case of the <b>error</b> <b>correction</b> problem. A subclass of impulsive noise for 2 -D signals is salt and pepper noise [32]. The information domain, where the sampling process occurs, is called the syndrome which is usually in a transform domain. Spectral estimation (row 10) is the dual of <b>error</b> <b>correction</b> codes, i.e., the sparsity is in the frequency domain. MSL (row 11) and multi-target detection in radars are similar to spectral estimation since targets act as spatial sparse mono-tones; each target is mapped to a specific spatial frequency regarding its line of sight direction relative to the receiver. The techniques developed for this branch of science is unique; with examples such as MUSIC [7], Prony [8], and Pisarenko [9]. We shall see that the techniques used <b>in</b> real-field <b>error</b> <b>correction</b> codes such as iterative methods (IMAT) can also be used in this area.|$|R
