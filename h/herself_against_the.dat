5|$|The earth may be personified as {{the goddess}} Bhudevi in Indian sculpture. Bhudevi is often shown {{as a small}} figure in the icon. She may be seated on or {{dangling}} from one of Varaha's tusks, or is seated {{on the corner of}} his folded elbow or his shoulder and supports <b>herself</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> tusk or the snout, as being lifted from the waters. In later Indian paintings, the whole earth or a part of it is depicted lifted up by Varaha's tusks. In Mahabalipuram, a rare portrayal shows an affectionate Varaha looking down to Bhudevi, who he carries in his arms. The earth may be portrayed as a globe, a flat stretch of mountainous land or an elaborate forest landscape with buildings, temples, humans, birds and animals. The defeated demon may be depicted trampled under Varaha's feet or being killed in combat by Varaha's gada. Nagas (snake gods) and their consorts Naginis (snake goddesses), residents of the underworld, may be depicted as swimming in the ocean with hands folded as a mark of devotion. Varaha may be also depicted standing on a snake or other minor creatures, denoting the cosmic waters.|$|E
25|$|After {{an urgency}} {{motion of the}} Bavarian SPD party in the Bavarian Parliament, the Minister of Justice Beate Merk (CSU party) defended herself {{in a speech in}} front of the Parliament on 15 December 2011 against the {{impression}} Mollath had been hospitalized due to his criminal complaint. The following day she was explaining through a spokesman, that the accommodation Mollaths in psychiatry was a consequence of his crimes and {{had nothing to do with}} his wife or his lawsuit against the bank. She said, Mollath harmed his wife with strangulation marks on the neck, large hematoma and a bleeding bite wound. He also stabbed dozens of car tires, including those on vehicles of the wife's lawyers. His accommodation was confirmed by the Federal court and is observed regularly. She defended <b>herself</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> allegations that the state prosecution had failed to act because of instructions from leading politicians. Thereupon, the state prosecutor himself directed some questions towards the HypoVereinsbank.|$|E
500|$|Themes of Social Darwinism and {{survival}} are prevalent throughout [...] "Beside the Dying Fire." [...] In the episode, Andrea {{is separated from}} the group and is forced to fend <b>herself</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> horde of walkers that invaded Hershel's farm. Mazzara felt that separating Andrea from her group would be essential in exploring her character in-depth, as he stated that she was viewed {{in the light of}} other characters on The Walking Dead.|$|E

60|$|She drew <b>herself</b> up <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall {{a little}} proudly, though still youthfully, {{with her hands}} behind her.|$|R
60|$|She {{clapped her}} hands before {{her eyes as she}} uttered this exclamation, as if to secure <b>herself</b> <b>against</b> seeing <b>the</b> fearful object she had alluded to.|$|R
2500|$|They have {{distinctive}} vocal styles, {{according to}} The Sydney Morning Heralds Bernard Zuel, [...] "er voice has a fractured feel like Jolie Holland; his has a smoke-on-the-beach drawl". While Nimmervoll offered, [...] "Angus has a Paul Simon style voice, {{in the high}} register, equally as suited to lead and harmony. Julia's {{is one of those}} girly, fragile theatrical voices very much in vogue in alt-folk these days. She'd struggle to distinguish <b>herself</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> competition, but alternating with Angus gives her the necessary platform of variety, and just as well, because the songs she takes charge of are such wonderful tales of forlorn reflection".|$|E
2500|$|At the 1989 Soul Train Music Awards, when Houston's {{name was}} called {{out for a}} nomination, a few in the {{audience}} jeered. Houston defended <b>herself</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> criticism, stating, [...] "If you're gonna have a long career, there's a certain way to do it, and I did it that way. I'm not ashamed of it." [...] Houston took a more urban direction with her third studio album, I'm Your Baby Tonight, released in November 1990. She produced and chose producers for this album and as a result, it featured production and collaborations with L.A. Reid and Babyface, Luther Vandross, and Stevie Wonder. The album showed Houston's versatility on a new batch of tough rhythmic grooves, soulful ballads and up-tempo dance tracks. Reviews were mixed. Rolling Stone felt it was her [...] "best and most integrated album". while Entertainment Weekly, at the time thought Houston's shift towards an urban direction was [...] "superficial".|$|E
2500|$|On 18 April 2007, the {{government}} barred Hasina from returning, {{saying that she}} had made provocative statements and that her return could cause disorder. This was described as a temporary measure. The CTG had also been trying to get Khaleda Zia to leave the country. Hasina vowed to return home, and on 22 April 2007, a warrant was issued for her arrest for murder. Describing the case against her as [...] "totally false and fake", Hasina said that she wanted to defend <b>herself</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> charges in court. On 23 April 2007, the arrest warrant was suspended, and on 25 April 2007, the ban on Hasina's entry into the country was dropped. [...] After spending 51 days in the United States and the UK, on 7 May 2007 Hasina returned to Dhaka, where she was greeted by a crowd of several thousand. She told reporters that {{the government}} should not have delayed her return.|$|E

60|$|She {{turned and}} drew herself {{up on the}} bed, {{screwing}} <b>herself</b> back <b>against</b> <b>the</b> pillow as if for support, with her knees drawn under her. He was astonished at the strength of her face and figure, thus entrenched.|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless, it {{was begun}} now, this passion, and must go on, {{the passion of}} Ursula to know her own maximum self, limited and so defined against him. She could limit and define <b>herself</b> <b>against</b> him, <b>the</b> male, she could be her maximum self, female, oh female, triumphant for one moment in {{exquisite}} assertion <b>against</b> <b>the</b> male, in supreme contradistinction to the male.|$|R
2500|$|Vengeance {{participated in}} the opening {{bombardment}} of the Ottoman Turkish entrance forts on 18 February and 19 February 1915, though her role as de Robeck's flagship limited her to observing the fire of the other ships in his formation. The battleship [...] developed problems with her capstan and so could not anchor in her firing position, forcing Vengeance to take her place. She bombarded the [...] "Orkanie" [...] fortress with direct fire, but aerial reconnaissance proved that the fortress guns had not been disabled. Nevertheless, Carden ordered Vengeance and several other battleships to close with their targets and engage them at close range. The French battleship [...] joined Vengeance in shelling [...] "Orkanie". Later in the afternoon, both ships began to engage a battery at Kumkale with their main guns, while their secondary battery kept firing at [...] "Orkanie". At 16:10, Carden ordered them to cease fire and inspect the fortification. On closing, Vengeance {{came under heavy fire}} from [...] "Orkanie" [...] and a battery at Cape Helles. Contre-amiral (Rear Admiral) Émile Guépratte, the commander of the French contingent, later wrote that [...] "the daring attack of the Vengeance in flinging <b>herself</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> forts when their fire was in no way reduced was one of the finest episodes of the day." [...] She suffered some damage to her masts and rigging from gunfire from the forts, but she was not hit directly. Several other battleships came to her aid, and at 17:20, Carden ordered a retreat.|$|E
60|$|The poor {{young mother}} went {{in fear and}} trembling, trying to stiffen <b>herself</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{expected}} blandishments.|$|E

60|$|She scrutinised his {{appearance}} and laughed softly, balancing <b>herself</b> easily <b>against</b> <b>the</b> oar {{which she had}} stretched {{out to the side}} of the tower. The moisture of the sea was upon her face and hair. A very becoming peignoir imperfectly concealed her bathing dress.|$|R
60|$|He said no {{more than}} that. He {{waited for her to}} resume. At a loss, she sat in silence awhile, a pucker on her white brow, her fingers nervously {{drumming}} on the table. At last she flung <b>herself</b> headlong <b>against</b> <b>the</b> impassive, polished front that he presented.|$|R
50|$|Bella Donna's memory slowly returned, and {{she felt}} as if her soul had been violated. Enraged, she had Rogue's {{comatose}} old boyfriend Cody kidnapped and murdered, once again pitting <b>herself</b> <b>against</b> Gambit. For <b>the</b> third time, he left her behind.|$|R
60|$|Fool. She's {{schooling}} {{herself and}} she's steeling <b>herself,</b> <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> dreary day, When she'll pine and sigh from her lattice high For the knight that's far away.|$|E
60|$|A sudden {{trembling}} seized her. She supported <b>herself</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{foot of the}} bed. Her whole future existence {{depended on}} her answer. She was incapable of uttering a word.|$|E
6000|$|... "Domesticity!" [...] said Fleur, and blotted <b>herself</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{hawthorn}} hedge. The blossom sprayed {{out above}} her head, and one pink cluster brushed her cheek. Jon put {{up his hand}} jealously to keep it off.|$|E
60|$|The boat {{makes her}} way up through the shipping, seeks her landing, and {{presently}} rubs <b>herself</b> affectionately <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wharf. The passengers quickly disperse themselves upon shore, dismissed each with an appropriate sarcasm by the tipsy man, who has had the means of keeping himself drunk throughout, and who now looks to the discharge of the boat's cargo.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{must go to}} {{bed early}} tonight,' she said, turning aside her face, ruffling his soft black hair. He {{stretched}} slightly, stiffening his arms, and smiled without answering. It was a very keen pleasure to be thus alone with her and in her charge. He rose, bidding her wrap <b>herself</b> up <b>against</b> <b>the</b> fog.|$|R

60|$|She {{raised her}} red arms {{above her head}} and {{flattened}} <b>herself</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall with elaborate care. Burton, hating himself and the whole situation, stepped into the parlor. Ellen followed him {{as far as the}} threshold.|$|E
60|$|There entered eight Germans {{into the}} second-class compartment, five men and three ladies. When {{at last the}} luggage was stowed away they sank into the seats. The last man on either side to be seated lowered himself carefully, like a wedge, between his two neighbours. Siegmund watched the stout man, {{the one who had}} led the charge, {{settling}} himself between his large lady and the small Helena. The latter crushed <b>herself</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> side of the carriage. The German's hips came down tight against her. She strove to lessen <b>herself</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> window, to escape the pressure of his flesh, whose heat was transmitted to her. The man squeezed in the opposite direction.|$|E
60|$|She saw him {{and began}} to speak, but he stopped and faced her. He faced her, {{grinding}} his teeth, and with such an awful fire of fury in his eyes that she shrank from him in terror, flattening <b>herself</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall.|$|E
60|$|Heartless, terrific as the {{repudiation}} was, {{it struck}} a self-convicting, almost sympathetic note in Janet. She <b>herself</b> had revolted <b>against</b> <b>the</b> monotony and sordidness of that existence She herself! She dared not complete the thought, now.|$|R
50|$|A new logo {{was adopted}} in 1996 {{following}} a proposal from Ramos' {{children and grandchildren}} which features the store's name in a more modern font in a red background.

The new logo design was a commissioned work by a Singapore-based company which also {{came up with a}} new store lay-out design.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Nesbit wearied <b>herself</b> with invectives <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Fotheringhams as {{the bane}} of the family, and assured Theodora {{that it was time}} to lay aside folly; her rank and beauty would not avail, and she would never be married.|$|R
6000|$|She steadied <b>herself</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{table with}} one hand, {{and put the}} other hand to her head. Her brain was giddy. The effort to think {{was too much for}} her. She said to herself, vacantly, [...] "The inn? What did I do at the inn?" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{watched the}} broad-faced woman, Mrs. Budgen, in whose grey eyes the {{fighting}} light so fortunately never died, painfully doing out her rooms, and propping <b>herself</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{chest of drawers}} whereon clustered china cups and dogs as thick as toadstools on a bank.|$|E
6000|$|Marcia {{seemed in}} these days to be {{schooling}} <b>herself</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> impulses that once brought on her quarrels with Bartley.

60|$|Not {{one minute}} all that night did Anna sleep. Was it remorse {{that kept her}} awake, or the {{intoxication}} of memory? If she felt that her kiss had been a crime, it was not against her husband or <b>herself,</b> but <b>against</b> <b>the</b> boy--the murder of illusion, of something sacred. But she could not help feeling a delirious happiness too, {{and the thought of}} trying to annul what she had done did not even occur to her.|$|R

25|$|Indenture, {{otherwise}} known as bonded labour or debt bondage, {{is a form of}} unfree labour under which a person pledges himself or <b>herself</b> <b>against</b> a loan. <b>The</b> services required to repay the debt, and their duration, may be undefined. Debt bondage can be passed on from generation to generation, with children required to pay off their progenitors' debt. It is the most widespread form of slavery today.
