One of his own deacons has always insisted that Mr. Arnold's theology was not sound and I am beginning to believe that there is some reason to fear it.

40|$|Many {{philosophers}} categorise {{judgment as}} a type of action. On the face of it, this claim is at odds with the seeming fact that judging a certain proposition <b>is</b> not <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do voluntarily. I argue that we can resolve this tension by recognising a category of non-voluntary action. An action can be non-voluntary without being involuntary. The notion of non-voluntary action is developed by appeal to the claim that judging has truth as a constitutive goal. This claim, when combined with a conception of judging as a way of settling a question, explains both why judging is genuinely agential, and why it is nevertheless non-voluntary. <br/...|$|R
