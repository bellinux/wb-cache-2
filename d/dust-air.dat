In particular a relationship between the standard ignition temperature of dust clouds and the temperature of the target at the minimum incident power at ignition (continuous irradiation) has been highlighted which seems to be similar to the one obtained for gases.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the experimental determination of the fundamental flame characteristics in a <b>dust-air</b> mixture and the influence of turbulence on flame propagation. Experiments were carried out in a tube having a 0. 19 meter inside diameter and a length of 0. 93 meter, and 1. 86 meter with both ends closed. A dispersion system was developed giving a good quality uniform dust suspension. A comparative method for the estimation of dust flame characteristics, based on well defined methane-air flame characteristics, was developed and employed to estimate the characteristics of a flame propagating in a cornstarch <b>dust-air</b> mixture. A systematic study of the influence of dispersion-induced turbulence on the dust flame propagation was carried out. The influence of obstacles on flame propagation also was investigated. Some mechanisms of flame propagation in a cornstarch <b>dust-air</b> mixture have been proposed and discussed. In the conclusion, general remarks concerning the dust flame characteristics and the influence of turbulence on flame propagation are made. The future direction of research is also indicated...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSome {{results of}} {{measurements}} of laminar burning velocities and of maximum flame temperatures for combustible <b>dust-air</b> mixtures (starch <b>dust-air</b> mixtures, lycopodium-air mixtures and sulphur flour-air mixtures) are presented. Thin (25 and 50 mu m) thermocouples {{have been used to}} measure maximum flame temperatures. The results are compared with those obtained with other devices such as resistors, pyrometers and are compared to the theoretical values. It appears that the observed discrepancies seem principally to come from the relatively poor efficiency of the burning processes inside the flame front than to heat losses by radiation as suggested before. Two methods for determining laminar burning velocities have been used: the classical 'tube method' and a 'direct method' based on the simultaneous determination of the flame speed and of the mixture velocity ahead of the flame front using a tomographic technique. Two different tube diameters are considered as well as additional results obtained with a small burner. The validity of these techniques is firstly assessed by comparing the results obtained with CH 4 -air mixtures and secondly by considering their relevancy for combustible <b>dust-air</b> mixtures (influence {{of the size of the}} apparatus). In particular, the influences of heat flame by radiation and of flame stretching are considered...|$|E
40|$|Explosion {{pressure}} rate rise (dp/dt) experiments for coal dust and methane-coal <b>dust-air</b> hybrid mixtures in a modified 20 L explosion apparatus {{were conducted to}} provide data on explosion characteristics in Ventilation Air Methane (VAM) systems. Coal dust concentrations of 10, 25, 50 and 100 g. m- 3; methane concentrations of 0. 75, 1. 25, 2. 5 and 5 %; and initial ignitor energies of 1, 5 and 10 kJ were investigated. The dp/dt of dilute coal dust-methane-air hybrid mixtures were strongly affected by the ignitor energy. The potential of higher energy boosting the fuel combustion from the flammable to the explosion phase was demonstrated. There was no observed influence on dp/dt at 10 g. m- 3 coal dust concentration.

40|$|A {{standard}} spherical apparatus {{for measuring}} explosion characteristics was modified to give increased and controlled turbulence within a <b>dust–air</b> mixture. This {{was intended to}} mimic the local effects which may occur during industrial dust explosions, particularly secondary ones which may develop in ducts or mine galleries where the initial explosion causes an increased air velocity and suspension of further quantities of dust. The results show {{that there may be}} a doubling of the maximum explosion pressure and of the rate of pressure rise during the explosion under more turbulent conditions. This is significant for modelling of dust explosions and suggests that explosion relief may be inadequate if this factor is not taken into consideration. The modified apparatus therefore gives a laboratory method for assessing the effect of turbulence in dust explosions. Web of Science 26121420...|$|E

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model for turbulent combustion and ignition of polydispersed <b>dust-air</b> mixtures is developed. The worked out {{mathematical model}} {{takes into account}} the two-way coupling effects in gas-particles interactions and combines both deterministic and stochastic approaches. The equations of motion for particles take into consideration the influence of random turbulent pulsations in the gas flow. The models for phase transitions and chemical reactions take into account thermal destruction of dust particles, vent of volatiles, chemical reactions in the gas phase, and heterogeneous oxidation of carbon by O 2 and CO 2 influenced by both diffusive and kinetic characteristics. The model is validated in comparison with experiments on organic dust combustion in confined volumes, under different levels of initial turbulization of the mixture. The developed mathematical model makes it possible to investigate the peculiarities of polydispersed organic dusts ignition and combustion and the influence of flow nonuniformities on the ignition limits.

The model describes the behaviour of a reacting particle which undergoes different steps during reaction: heating, devolatilization and homogeneous combustion. The model predicts the maximum {{values of the}} deflagration index, also including the role of turbulence. Four explosion regimes have been introduced {{to take into account}} the effect on the KSt value of the dust diameter and of the dust shape (different from sphere). These regimes are defined as function of dimensionless numbers (Bi, Da, Th) which contain the chemico-hysical properties of the <b>dust-air</b> mixtures.

40|$|In {{industrial}} conditions, {{there are}} different kinds of installations endangered by an explosion of dust-gas mixtures [1, 2]. In order {{to prevent them from}} severe consequences of potential explosions, active protection systems, which use various kinds of suppressing materials, like suppressing powders and water, are increasingly widely applied [3, 4, 5, 6]. Results of the experiments are presented in the work. The main objective of the research was to investigate influence of various parameters like triggering overpressure, type of gas generator, number of extinguishers etc. on efficiency of suppression system. Efficiency of dust explosion suppression of two various types of the extinguishers, using water or suppressing powder, was compared. The main conclusion of this research is that water can be a very effective suppressing medium in suppression of <b>dust-air</b> mixtures explosion.

40|$|The {{explosion}} behaviour of heterogeneous/homogeneous fuel-air (hybrid) mixtures is here analysed {{and compared}} to the explosion features of heterogeneous fuel-air and homogeneous fuel air mixtures separately. Experiments are performed to measure the pressure history, deflagration index and flammability limits of nicotinic acid/acetone-air mixtures in a standard 20 L Siwek bomb adapted to vapour-air mixtures. Literature data are also used for comparison. The explosion tests performed on gas-air mixtures in the same conditions as explosion tests of <b>dust-air</b> mixtures, show {{that the increase in}} explosion severity of dust/gas air mixtures has to be addressed to the role of initial level of turbulence prior to ignition. At a fixed value of the equivalence ratio, by substituting the dust to the flammable gas in a dust/gas-air mixture the explosion severity decreases. Furthermore, the most severe conditions of dust-gas/air mixtures is found during explosion of gas-air mixture at stoichiometric concentration. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|A {{well known}} {{limitation}} of the ’cube-root-law’ is that it becomes invalid when the flame thickness is significant {{with respect to the}} vessel radius. In the literature flame thicknesses in <b>dust-air</b> mixtures ranging from 15 to 80 centimeters have been reported [1], which exceed the radii of the 20 - 1 itre sphere and the 1 m 3 vessel. Therefore we have developed a model (the three zone model) for the pressure evolution of confined dust explosions in spherical vessels which takes the flame thickness into account. The pressure-time curves that are generated with this model show a good resemblance with those measured in practice. It is shown by numerical simulations that the maximum rate of pressure rise can be normalized with respect to the vessel volume {{as well as to the}} flame thickness and that the ’cube-root-law’ becomes inaccurate for relative flame thicknesses exceeding 1 %. Furthermore, the actual burning velocity and the flame thickness during real dust explosions can be obtained by fitting the model to the experimental pressure-time curve. Applied Science...|$|E
40|$|Looking at the German and Dutch statistics, the {{percentage}} of dust explosions in all industries dealing with explosible <b>dust-air</b> mixtures which have been ignited by electrostatic discharges is about 8 - 10 %. However, in the plastics industry this value is much higher: 25 %. In particular {{in the last few}} years some rather large industrial incidents probably have been caused by electrostatic charges. To understand why accidents may happen due to static electricity the several dangerous electrostatic discharges will be discussed briefly in connection with dust explosion hazards. In particular the propagating brush discharge and the cone or " Maurer " discharge are important. Ignitions are caused mainly in the case of easily ignitable powders or hybrid mixtures (powders in combination with flammable vapours) due to isolated conductors and non-conducting materials as the product itself or such process parts as flexible hoses, internally coated silos and ducts. To illustrate how hazards by electrostatic discharges may develop in real life both on a small and a large scale a few examples will be briefly discussed...|$|E
30|$|In a methane {{explosion}} event, {{the explosion}} propagation can quickly reach supersonic and thus generates shock wave. The shock wave is well capable of suspending the settled coal and rock dusts into mine air. Under this condition, the suspended rock dust {{along with the}} unexploded coal dust {{can act as a}} physical heat sink to absorb the heat in the passing hot air for creating a temperature equilibrium between the dust and air. Based on the law of energy conservation, a simplified model can be derived for assessing the rock dust’s heat sink effect. For example, a coal dust load is assumed to be 1.2  kg per meter length of a 2  m ×  6  m mine entry to create <b>dust-air</b> mixture at the minimum explosive concentration of 100  g/m 3 if fully suspended in the air. To demonstrate the heat sink effect of rock dusting, the entry is dusted with limestone powder at 0.00, 2.23 and 4.80  kg per meter of entry to create 0 %, 65 % and 80 % rock dust concentrations, respectively. In an explosion event, the passing hot air at 2000  °C suspends and fully mixes with the coal and rock dusts at a point. The airborne coal and rock dusts (originally at ambient temperature of 16  °C) absorb the heat from the hot air and lower its temperature.|$|E

Energy is generally derived either through direct combustion or gasification. The Irish forestry sector is forecasted to expand significantly in coming years, and so the opportunity exists for the bioenergy sector {{to take advantage of}} the material for which there will be no demand from current markets. A by-product of wood processing, wood dust is the cheapest form of wood material available to the bioenergy sector. Currently wood dust is primarily processed into wood pellets for energy generation. Research was conducted on post-processing birch wood dust; the calorific value and the Wobbe Index were determined for a number of wood particle sizes and wood dust concentrations. The Wobbe Index determined for the upper explosive concentration (4000 g/m 3) falls within range of that of hydrogen gas, and wood <b>dust-air</b> mixtures of this concentration could therefore behave in a similar manner in a gas turbine. Due to its slightly lower HHV and higher particle density, however, alterations to the gas turbine would be necessary to accommodate wood dust to prevent abrasive damage to the turbine.

40|$|AbstractDespite the {{significant}} progress made towards {{the understanding of}} flame propagation mechanisms in <b>dust-air</b> mixtures, dust explosions still have a frequent occurrence and their danger presents a continuous threat to industries that produce, use and treat solid powders and dusts of combustible materials. In fact, many physical aspects are still needed to be clarified given the major difference existing between flame propagating in gaseous mixtures and in suspensions and many questions are still unanswered regarding the reasons behind the violence of fine metal dust explosions. Few experimental observations and theoretical considerations emphasized the potential role of radiation heat transfer in the behaviour of dust clouds’ flames in which acceleration in flame propagation speed and instabilities were observed. Unfortunately, only few information is available, so far, concerning the capacity of radiative transfers of {{taking part in the}} propagation process. While investigating radiation phenomenon in dust clouds, we are faced with a complicated problem difficult to model analytically. The development of numerical approach, based on discrete element method (DEM), in order to treat this problem, seems more convenient. MULTICOR code, developed at the LTI, has already succeeded at modelling heat transfer in a bed of particles. Under this work, radiative heat transfer exchanged between particles in suspension is successfully calculated and we propose an original method of calculating heat transfers between dust and gas in the preheat zone of the flame. We are currently working on adapting the radiation models implemented to the case of fine particles and taking into consideration light scattered. With the purpose of determining the flame propagation speed and improving the knowledge of the phenomena involved, {{it would be possible to}} contribute to the development of suitable means of prevention and mitigation of dust explosion hazard...|$|E
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{properties of}} dust flame propagation {{have been studied}} experimentally and theoretically. Experiments were carried out in a Pyrex tube having a 5 cm inside diameter and a length of 1. 2 meters. The dust dispersion system in the present experiment has been demonstrated to produce a laminar flow with uniform dust concentration. It is observed that the propagating flame exhibits a truly laminar character of propagation. Propagation and quenching of <b>dust-air</b> flames were measured for aluminum dust for a relatively wide range of dust concentration. It was observed {{that the process of}} the dust flame propagation in the tube can be divided into three different stages: laminar flame, oscillating flame and turbulent accelerating flame. During the first stage, the flame propagates with approximately constant speed and the flame is laminar. This stage is about 1 / 3 to 1 / 2 of the tube length and the shape of the flame front during this phase is close to the usual parabolic shape. In the second stage, flame starts to oscillate. Bright regular flashes alternate with stages when the flame is almost invisible. The third stage of the flame propagation can be observed only if the dust concentration is close to or higher than stoichiometric. The quenching distance and flame velocity of an aluminum dust flame under different initial oxygen concentrations and with different inert gases such as helium and nitrogen were also measured. When the amount of the initial oxygen concentration decreases, both the quenching distance and the lean limit increase, while the flame velocity decreases. On the other hand, after using helium as the inert gas of the mixture, it was observed that the whole value of the quenching distance, the lean limit, and the flame velocity increase. However, the objective is to understand the mechanism of the dust flame propagation. Theoretical models have also been developed to correlate the data to achieve {{a better understanding of the}} propagation mecha...|$|E
40|$|Research with {{heterogeneous}} mixtures involving solid particulate in closed, constant-volume bombs {{is typically}} {{limited by the}} powder dispersion technique. This work details {{the development of an}} experimental apparatus that promotes ideal conditions, namely a quiescent atmosphere and uniform particle distribution, for measuring laminar, heterogeneous flame propagation. In this thesis, two methods of dispersing particles are investigated. In the first, heterogeneous mixtures are made in a secondary vessel that is connected to the main experiment. Particles are dispersed into the secondary vessel by adapting a piston-driven particle injector, which has been shown to produce uniform particle distributions. The heterogeneous mixture is then transferred to the main bomb facility and ignited after laminar conditions are achieved. In the second method of dispersion, particles are directly injected into the main experimental facility using a strong blast of compressed air. As with the first approach, enough time is given (~ 4 minutes) for the mixture to become quiescent before ignition occurs. An extinction diagnostic is also applied to the secondary mixing vessel as well as the primary experimental facility (for both dispersion methods) to provide a qualitative understanding of the dispersion technique. To perform this diagnostic a 632. 8 -nm, 5 -mW Helium-Neon (HeNe) laser was employed. Aluminum nano-particles with an average diameter of 100 nm were used in this study. It was found that for typical dust loadings produced with both dispersion techniques, a pure <b>dust-air</b> system would not ignite due to the current spark ignition system. Thus, a hybrid mixture of Al/CH 4 /O 2 /N 2 was employed to achieve the project goal of demonstrating a system for controlled laminar flame speed measurements in aerosol mixtures. With the hybrid mixture, the combustion characteristics were studied both with and without the presence of nano-Al particles. Based on the experimental results, the simplicity of the "direct-injection" methodology compared to that of the "side-vessel" is desirable and will be further investigated as a viable alternative, or improvement, to the side-vessel technology...|$|E
40|$|If {{the ability}} of {{reactive}} solid particles to give rise to combustible mixtures when they are finely dispersed in an oxidizing gas is well known since a long time, the actual mechanisms governing the propagation of combustion {{in this kind of}} reactive mixtures is far from being well understood. The reason for this is an insufficient knowledge of the fundamental properties of characteristic parameters of dust flames. To progress in the prediction of dust explosion hazards and of their effects, substantial fundamental results concerning the structure and properties of dust flames are needed. Many works have been devoted to the measurement of the explosion pressure of dust air mixtures inside closed vessels and to try to derive the combustion rate from pressure evolution as function of time. In spite of the interest of this method of investigation, due to the simplicity of carrying out experiments, it does not permit to have a direct access to the measurement of the characteristic parameters of the reaction zone and to investigate its structure. As a result, several researchers have undertaken the study of flame propagation in tubes. In previous papers, we have described an experimental method to study the propagation of a flame at constant pressure, displayed original results in the case of laminar starch particles-air flames, and discussed the possibility to derive the laminar burning velocity from the registration of the parameters of a freely propagating laminar flame. However, despite the interest of these new results concerning the flame shape or fundamental parameters, such as the laminar burning velocity, the quenching distance, [...] . the information to our disposal is yet insufficient to permit a correct description of a dust flame. Indeed, progression in this domain is dependent on the knowledge of another fundamental parameter of the flame which is the temperature. But, until now, we have only rough and contradictory results about the temperature of <b>dust-air</b> flames, {{as a result of the}} great difficulties to perform experiments of direct measurements of the temperature in this kind of reactive systems. We expose, hereafter, the first effort made to acquire new and original experimental results on this problem...|$|E
