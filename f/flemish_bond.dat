5|$|When Norfolk {{was first}} settled, homes {{were made of}} wood and frame construction, similar to most medieval English-style homes. These homes had wide {{chimneys}} and thatch roofs. Some decades after the town was first laid out in 1682, the Georgian architectural style, which was popular in the South at the time, was used. Brick was considered more substantial construction; patterns were made by brick laid and <b>Flemish</b> <b>bond.</b> This style evolved to include projecting center pavilions, Palladian windows, balustraded roof decks, and two-story porticoes. By 1740, homes, warehouses, stores, workshops, and taverns began to dot Norfolk's streets.|$|E
5|$|Jeremiah Fisher {{constructed}} two row houses, {{joined by}} a common wall and constructed of brick laid in a <b>Flemish</b> <b>bond,</b> near the city square in 1817. These houses lay on Second Street and face west onto Constitution Square. Fisher owned and rented these houses until 1850, but after he sold them they were used as tenements until at least the 1940s. The Wilderness Trace Art League and Boyle County Historical Society Museum occupied the row houses, before the park's purchase by the county. It now houses the Danville-Boyle County Chamber of Commerce, the Arts Commission of Danville-Boyle County, and the communications department of the Danville Boyle-County Economic Development Partnership.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{the parkway}} concept of Calvert Vaux and Frederick Law Olmsted, {{designers}} of New York City's Central Park, the planners of the Colonial Parkway used {{a model of}} a limited access highway with broad sweeping curves, set in a landscaped right-of-way devoid of commercial development. These features, derived from 19th-century Romantic landscape theories, created a safer and more pleasant drive compared to the increasingly congested urban strips. In addition to protecting the views, culvert headwalls and parkway underpasses were clad in [...] "Virginia-style" [...] brick laid in English and <b>Flemish</b> <b>bonds</b> to promote a [...] "colonial-era" [...] effect. Design features such as molded coping rails, string courses and buttresses followed the historical prototypes found at Williamsburg.|$|R
5000|$|Situated on an {{isolated}} 20 acres in Union County, South Carolina, the 2650 square foot Means House is an unrestored federal treasure. Built in 1821, the Means House {{is an example}} of Georgian architecture. The house features rare <b>Flemish</b> <b>bonded</b> brick and Federal period woodwork.

5|$|The farm {{buildings}} of Home Farm, including its dovecote, {{were built in}} the early-19th century, and feature <b>Flemish</b> <b>bond</b> brickwork. Sinderland House, also dating from the early-19th century, is another of Dunham Massey's listed farmhouses. Manor Farmhouse, on Station Road, was built by George Booth, 2nd Earl of Warrington; the building dates from the mid-18th century and features both Flemish and garden wall bond brickwork. The farmhouse on Station Road was built in 1752. The barn on Woodhouse Lane dates from the early 18th century and features garden wall bond brickwork, a slate roof, and upper cruck frames. Dog Farmhouse, also on Woodhouse Lane, was built in the early 19th century; however it may have been an adaptation of an earlier, possibly 18th-century, farmhouse.|$|E
5|$|The newer building, {{constructed}} in 1752 {{under the guidance}} of architects William Hiorne and his brother David, consists of five bays, with a large bay at the side, constructed around 1800 to connect it to the older building. There is a central portico, with a flat roof supported by four ionic columns, added in 1926. The tripartite windows of the ground floor contrast with the French windows of the first floor, which are fronted by cast iron balconies. The attic floor has small 4 x 2 pane windows. The rear of the house consists of four bays, with a large central window on the first floor and a central door, surrounded with ashlar cornicing. Both sections of the house are {{constructed in}} red <b>Flemish</b> <b>bond</b> brick, which, until 1926, was covered with render.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 18th or early 19th century {{it was given}} a <b>Flemish</b> <b>Bond</b> brick face and the rear was {{extended}} with a catslide roof. A slate-roofed, single-level extension {{was added to the}} south prior to 1867. The front ground floor was remodelled sometime between 1900 and 1930, with a doorcase removed and a fascia and cornice added. Later in the 20th century, single-storey extensions were added to the north in the 1960s, and also to the rear (both with flat roofs) and the south, including a uPVC conservatory. The front of the building was also modelled, with a wider front door, fascia sign and plinth added across both the original frontage and the extensions, dividing the architectural features of the ground and first floors. A large amount of the pre-1840 fabric of the building, including first floor joinery, survives into the 21st century.|$|E
25|$|<b>Flemish</b> {{stretcher}} <b>bond</b> separates {{courses of}} alternately laid stretchers and headers, {{with a number}} of courses of stretchers alone. Brickwork in this bond may have between one and four courses of stretchers to one course after the Flemish manner. The courses of stretchers are often but not always staggered in a raking pattern.|$|R

5|$|There {{have been}} at least four {{successive}} mansion houses at Holnicote. Limited information is available about the early buildings. One is known to have been built between 1493 and 1521, based on dendrochronology from surviving timbers. The Grade II* listed gatehouse and attached cottage were built together with a new house in the early 17th century. Following the purchase of the estate by the Blackford family in 1705, a new mansion house was built {{on the site of the}} previous structure. Only the stable block from that building survives. The house was destroyed by fire in 1779. The Acland family re-built it as a thatched hunting lodge, which was also destroyed by fire in 1851, and replaced in 1861. A kitchen extension was added in 1874. The lodge was built in the 19th century. The estate includes several cottages including Rose Bower and the 17th-century Butlers Cottage. An 18th-century <b>Flemish</b> <b>bond</b> red brick granary also exists on the estate.|$|E
5|$|As {{well as the}} two churches {{dedicated}} to Saint Werburgh, there are 15 other GradeII listed buildings. The parish rooms and caretaker's house were built in 1889, and designed by John Douglas. Also built in the village by Douglas was the post office in 1893, and Warburton School in 1871–72; this has been converted to a residence but still features crucks supporting the roof. Some farm buildings in Warburton are also listed, including the farmhouse on Moss Lane. The barn is 18th-century but features crucks which may be 17th-century or earlier. The timber framed farm building on Park Road is 17th-century in origin; the late-18th-century farmhouse on Warburton Lane was made with <b>Flemish</b> <b>bond</b> brick and has a slate roof. The barn on Paddock Lane dates from the 17th century. Also on Paddock Lane are two farmhouses: one was built in 1717 by Thomas Egerton and features an inglenook fireplace; the other is Wigsey Farmhouse which was originally built in the 17th century with later additions, including a 19th-century porch. The building on Warburton Lane near Villa Farmhouse was originally a timber framed building from the 16th or early 17th century. The house features late-16th- or early-17th-century frescos of a woman, possibly St Werburgh, with two geese and a rose.|$|E
5|$|At Langport, the Great Bow Bridge, {{which now}} carries the A378, is a three-arched bridge, {{constructed}} {{under the terms}} of the Parrett Navigation Act of 1836. Completed in 1841 at a cost of £3,749, it replaced the previous medieval bridge, with its nine tiny arches, all too small to allow navigation. A bridge at this site was first mentioned in 1220. The medieval bridge consisted of a total of 31 arches, of which nine crossed the river, and 19 of the original arches were located by ground-penetrating radar in 1987, buried beneath the road which runs from Great Bow Bridge to Little Bow Bridge. The Warehouse in Langport was built in the late 18th century of English bond red brick, with <b>Flemish</b> <b>bond</b> extensions. It has clay plain tile roofs with hipped ends. It was built by the Parrett Navigation Company, a trading company owned by Vincent Stuckey and Walter Bagehot, on the banks of the River. When the river became unnavigable, the building was no longer needed, and it was eventually abandoned. The Somerset Trust for Sustainable Development, which became the Ecos Trust, purchased the site, designated as a brown field site, in February 2003, and worked with Somerset Buildings Preservation Trust, English Heritage and local councils to redevelop it into a craft, heritage learning and small business centre, with the surrounding land being used for an eco-friendly housing development. It is a grade II listed building.|$|E
50|$|The wall to {{the west}} of the house is of brick, with at least the lower fifteen courses being {{consistent}} with the construction of the dwelling in terms of fabric and courses. The upper c. 25 courses are laid in <b>Flemish</b> garden wall <b>bond</b> in larger bricks with occasional over-fired headers culminating in a contrasting coping stone cap.|$|R
50|$|While the {{interior}} was renovated {{in the early nineteenth}} century, many original features still exist. These include the triple-run walnut staircase, pine floors, chair rails, and doors, which feature both HL and foliated H hinges. The brick exterior, which was constructed in both <b>Flemish</b> and English <b>bond,</b> remains largely untouched. The half-hipped roof was originally built without the current dormers, which were added on subsequent renovations. The original cedar shingles have been replaced with slate.|$|R
50|$|The {{boundary}} {{wall at the}} eastern end of the house has a low stepped plinth consistent in height with that of the house. Above the plinth there are approximately 12 courses of wall laid in English bond albeit with some evidence of patching and repair. A soldier course of over-fired headers separates the lower (earlier) fabric and the remaining courses that are laid in a variation of <b>Flemish</b> garden wall <b>bond.</b> The eastern end of the wall curves round towards the gated entrance.|$|R
5|$|Station 2 was {{constructed}} in the 1920s and considered significant as a rare surviving example of early 20th-century industrial architecture. It was designed in an industrial Beaux-Arts style, with large arched windows and stringcourse intended {{to prevent it from}} becoming an eyesore given its proximity to affluent communities. It {{was constructed}} with <b>Flemish</b> <b>bond</b> brickwork and decorative limestone elements. It was also constructed to minimize noise and ash pollution. Buildings with such architectural detail were usually found in urban areas, making the Glenwood plant unusual for being far from urban areas {{at the time of its}} construction. The building was divided into three sections: a narrow four-story administration section to the north containing offices; a five-story turbine room containing a large open space with decorated glazed buff brick walls; and a six-story boiler house mainly filled with equipment, topped by six 140-foot smoke stacks (ultimately reaching 265 feet above the floor slab). At the time of its demolition the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation determined that it appeared to meet the criteria for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, triggering an alternative use analysis. Given the building's poor condition after three decades of disuse, the excessive cost of making the building structurally sound prevented any plans to retain or renovate it.|$|E
25|$|Brickwork {{that appears}} as <b>Flemish</b> <b>bond</b> {{from both the}} front and the rear is double <b>Flemish</b> <b>bond,</b> so called {{on account of the}} front and rear {{duplication}} of the pattern. If the wall is arranged such that the bricks at the rear do not have this pattern, then the brickwork is said to be single <b>Flemish</b> <b>bond.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Munro – M.A. Hanna Mining Company Office Building is a large, symmetrical, two-story, Classical Revival brick {{structure}} with a projecting stone-trimmed front entrance. The <b>Flemish</b> <b>bond</b> exterior is augmented by a frieze of decorative brickwork and segmental-arch windows.|$|E
50|$|An {{architectural}} anomaly in {{an otherwise}} rural townscape, the church stands as a very austere composition of four simple architectural forms, each accommodating {{one of the principal}} interior areas of the church: the entry/bell tower; nave; chancel and vestry. The cavity brick wall construction is exceptional and features pale, sandy coloured cavity face bricks, with flush vertical and recessed horizontal mustard coloured mortar joints, skilfully laid in a combination of English <b>bond</b> and <b>Flemish</b> garden wall <b>bond</b> with brick- on-edge and soldier course detailing. All openings feature stepped reveals externally and stepped mitred reveals internally.|$|R
50|$|The Hall House {{is located}} in {{southern}} Wallingford, north of the village of South Wallingford, and a short way north of {{a point where the}} road and railroad are briefly in close proximity. The house is a 2-1/2 story brick structure, standing {{on the west side of}} the highway, with its front-facing gable oriented toward the road. The brick is laid in a combination of <b>Flemish</b> and common <b>bond,</b> with marble window sills and lintels, and marble stairs leading to the entrance. The entrance is set in the leftmost of three bays, in an arched opening with a louver above the door. A similar louver is found in the center of the fully pedimented gable.|$|R
50|$|Daniël Termont (born 19 May 1953) is a Belgian politician, {{member of}} the Socialist Party and the mayor of Ghent, Belgium. He {{was the son of}} shopkeepers who lived in Mariakerke. His mother's family was {{strongly}} socialistically engaged. In 1971, Daniel obtained a degree in accounting at the Stedelijk Instituut voor Handel en Secretariaat. He did his military service as from April 1972 until April 1973 and worked later on for ten years as a federal charge of LTA (Mutuality of Young Workers), the youth organization of the Socialist Unions at that time. Until 1980 he was also an information officer at the East <b>Flemish</b> Division (<b>Bond</b> Moyson) in the area Ghent-Eeklo. He has been elected to the city council since 1976. Later on, from 1983 until 1988, he was also director of De Ceder holiday centre in Deinze. He was the first director of the centre after a renovation which followed after many years of decline of the institution. Subsequently, from 1988 to 1995, he was secretary-treasurer of Bond Moyson, the year he took his first full-time political office as a councilor in Ghent. From 1995 until 2006, he was alderman of the harbour (Port of Ghent). Between 2001 and 2006 he was also alderman of festivities.|$|R
