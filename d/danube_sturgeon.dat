50|$|The Russian {{sturgeon}} (Acipenser gueldenstaedtii), {{also known}} as the diamond sturgeon or <b>Danube</b> <b>sturgeon,</b> is a species of fish in the Acipenseridae family. It is found in Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Georgia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Romania, Russia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine. It is also found in the Caspian Sea. This fish can grow up to about 235 cm and weigh 115 kg. Russian sturgeon mature and reproduce slowly, making them highly vulnerable to fishing. It is distinguished from other Acipenser species by its short snout with a rounded tip as well as its lower lip which is interrupted at its center.|$|E
40|$|Populations of six {{sturgeon}} {{species in}} the Danube River (Beluga, Russian sturgeon, Stellate sturgeon, Sterlet, Ship sturgeon and Atlantic sturgeon) have experienced severe decline during the last several decades, mostly due to the unsustainable fishery, river fragmentation and water pollution. In the present study, the question of viability of <b>Danube</b> <b>sturgeon</b> populations and the poor knowledge of their ecology have been addressed through three different research activities: 1) statistical methods that infer extinction based on sighting records {{have been used to}} assess probability of extinction of the Ship and Atlantic sturgeon, whose presence n the Danube basin is uncertain; 2) assessment of microelement accumulation in sturgeon pectoral fin rays, especially of strontium and calcium, has been conducted as a method that can reveal migration patterns of anadromous sturgeons; 3) population viability analysis in a Vortex simulation model has been conducted in order to assess the state of the six <b>Danube</b> <b>sturgeon</b> species, their future risk of extinction and to determine the most suitable conservation and management measures. Methods for inferring extinction based on sighting records provided a significant probability that the Atlantic sturgeon is extinct, with extinction occurring somewhere between 1966 and 1970, and that the Ship sturgeon is probably still present in the Danube basin, but that extinction may occur within a few decades. A new model has been also developed within the present study, able to infer probability of extinction based on the trends in sighting intervals, since this issue was not adequately considered in the existing models. Although the analysis of the strontium to calcium ratio in sturgeon pectoral fin rays has revealed changes that might indicate probable migration of juvenile fish from the river to the sea, further studies are needed for improvement of this method. Population viability analysis has revealed a large sensitivity of the <b>Danube</b> <b>sturgeon</b> populations to changes in the natural mortality, fecundity, age at maturity and spawning frequency. It was also confirmed that the sturgeons are highly susceptible to even moderate levels of commercial fishery, and that their recovery is a multi-decadal affair. Stocking with adult individuals was shown to produce considerably greater effect on population persistence than stocking with juveniles, but the latter approach is probably still preferable since it avoids many inherent problems of aquaculture cultivation. This study represents the first population viability analysis of the Danube sturgeons...|$|E

40|$|Acipenseriformes are {{composed}} of 25 sturgeon species and two paddlefish species distributed exclusively in the northern hemisphere. The Danube River and the Black Sea were originally inhabited by six sturgeon species but two are extinct and only four are still reproducing currently in the Lower Danube: Huso huso, Acipenser stellatus, A. gueldenstaedtii and A. ruthenus. Sturgeon species hybridize more easily than other fish and the determination of pure species or hybrid status is important for conservation and for breeding in fish farms. This survey demonstrated that morphological determination of this status is not reliable and a molecular tool, based on eight microsatellites genotypes is proposed. This method, based on three successive statistical analyses including Factorial Correspondence Analysis (FCA), Structure assignation and NewHybrids status determination, showed a high efficiency in discriminating pure species specimens from F 1, F 2 and two kinds of backcross individuals involving {{three of the four}} reproducing Lower <b>Danube</b> <b>sturgeon</b> species...|$|E
40|$|Sturgeon {{populations in}} the Danube River have {{experienced}} severe decline during the last several decades, mostly due to the poorly regulated fishery, river fragmentation and water pollution. This study focuses on gaining better understanding of sturgeon life history primarily by addressing the assessment of microelement accumulation in sturgeon pectoral fin rays, especially of strontium and calcium, as a method that can reveal migration patterns of anadromous sturgeons. Analysis was performed on pectoral fin samples of three anadromous <b>Danube</b> <b>sturgeon</b> species (beluga, Russian sturgeon and stellate sturgeon) {{by the use of}} a Nuclear Microprobe technique. The most frequent pattern in analyzed samples was represented by a low Sr:Ca ratio in the innermost annuli, followed by an increased ratio in the middle annuli segment, and often with a decreased ratio in the outermost annuli. Probability density estimate has revealed three distinguished maxima of the Sr: Ca ratio, 7. 08 x 10 (- 3), 8. 98 x 10 (- 3) and 9. 90 x 10 (- 3), which might correspond, respectively, to fresh, brackish and saltwater. Although the analysis of the Sr: Ca ratio in sturgeon pectoral fin rays has revealed changes that might indicate probable migration between habitats with different water salinity, further studies are needed for improvement of this method. This study represents the first analysis of this kind that was conducted on sturgeon species from the Black Sea basin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Danube {{sturgeons}} {{are highly}} threatened (IUCN Red List) and {{two out of}} six native species are already extinct. The Sturgeon Action Plan enforced in 2005 {{in the framework of}} the Bern Convention signed by all Danube countries, lists 72 actions for sturgeon conservation. First priority is the reopening of the Iron Gate I and II hydropower dams, as these disrupt sturgeon spawning migration from the Black Sea to the Middle and Upper Danube. The situation in the region of the Iron Gate dams is extremely complex (navigation locks, transboundary between Romania and Serbia, sturgeon fishery bans, habitat degradation), and monitoring of migrating sturgeons is just in the beginning. Therefore, in view of limited experience, the design, construction and implementation of fish passages for sturgeons will be very difficult and demanding. The first steps for the necessary feasibility study were done by a FAO-Mission in 2011 and a Pilot Study performed by a Dutch Consortium during 2013 / 14. The respective reports will be outlined by Wilco De Bruijne in the sister presentation of this special session introduction. The political background has been prepared by the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR, Danube River Basin Management Plan), and the <b>Danube</b> <b>Sturgeon</b> Task Force (DSTF) is coordinating sturgeon activities in the frame of the EU Strategy for the Danube Region (Strategy/Program ‚ÄúSturgeon 2020 ‚Äù). This special session, in particular, the Round Table discussion, is aimed at gathering state-of-the-art knowledge on sturgeon behavior related to crossing fish passes (upstream and downstream) ...|$|E
40|$|Sturgeons {{belong to}} one of the oldest {{families}} of bony fish in existence, having their first appearance in the fossil records approximately 200 million years ago. Their natural habitats are found in the subtropical, temperate and sub-Arctic rivers, lakes and coastlines of Eurasia and North America. In the Romanian waters, five anadromous species of sturgeon, out of the total 25 species known by science, once migrated from the Black Sea into the Danube for spawning: beluga; Huso huso, Russian sturgeon; Acipenser gueldenstaedtii, stellate sturgeon; A. stellatus, ship sturgeon; A. nudiventris and the European Atlantic sturgeon; A. sturio (Knight, 2009). The NW Black Sea and Lower <b>Danube</b> River <b>sturgeons,</b> like many Acipenserids, were seriously affected by the rapid changes brought by human development. Being one of the finest caviar producers in the world they were intensively harvested for many centuries. Heavy uncontrolled fishing and destruction of habitat led to the collapse of most of the Acipenserids and the total disappearance of the European Atlantic sturgeon (A. sturio) from the NW Black Sea. Public attention was focused world wide on sturgeons after their listing in the IUCN Red List of Threatened species in 1996. In 1998, after evaluating their abundance in the wild, CITES also decided to strictly regulate the international trade in all Acipenserids. The paper aims to analyze and review conservation measures that were taken locally, nationally and internationally by humans and the effect they had on one of Europe 9 ÃÜ 2 s only naturally reproducing sturgeon populations...|$|R
