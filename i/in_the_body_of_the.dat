5|$|As {{mentioned}} above, stubs {{lend themselves}} to band-pass designs. General forms of these are similar to stub low-pass filters except that the main line {{is no longer a}} narrow high impedance line. Designers have many different topologies of stub filters to choose from, some of which produce identical responses. An example stub filter is shown in figure 12; it consists of a row of λ/4 short-circuit stubs coupled together by λ/4 impedance transformers. The stubs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> filter are double paralleled stubs while the stubs on the end sections are only singles, an arrangement that has impedance matching advantages. The impedance transformers have the effect of transforming the row of shunt anti-resonators into a ladder of series resonators and shunt anti-resonators. A filter with similar properties can be constructed with λ/4 open-circuit stubs placed in series with the line and coupled together with λ/4 impedance transformers, although this structure is not possible in planar technologies.|$|E
5|$|His {{building}} projects were concentrated in Edinburgh, where, from 1637, {{he served as}} principal master mason to the city. For ten years {{he was involved in}} the construction of the Tron Kirk on the High Street, which opened in 1647. The Tron was built to house the congregation of St Giles', which had been raised to cathedral status, and was laid out in the new T-plan form with the pulpit in the centre, to suit reformed worship. The design was informed by contemporary Dutch architecture and, in particular, by the work of Hendrick de Keyser whose Architectura Moderna showcased his church designs in the Netherlands. Mylne worked on the building with master wright John Scott who was responsible for the timber work. The building was executed in a Dutch influenced style with both gothic and classical details. The church was not fully complete before Mylne's death and was subsequently remodelled in the 18th century. A new spire was added in the 19th century following a fire, but Mylne's work can be seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kirk. The carved tympanum was executed by Mylne's brother Alexander.|$|E

5|$|The {{elements}} of a passive linear electrical network consist of inductors, capacitors and resistors which have the properties of inductance, elastance (inverse capacitance) and resistance, respectively. The mechanical counterparts of these properties are, respectively, mass, stiffness and damping. In most electronic filter designs, only inductor and capacitor elements are used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> filter (although the filter may be terminated with resistors at the input and output). Resistances are not present in a theoretical filter composed of ideal components and only arise in practical designs as unwanted parasitic elements. Likewise, a mechanical filter would ideally consist only of components with the properties of mass and stiffness, but in reality some damping is present as well.|$|E
5|$|The insertion-loss {{method of}} {{designing}} filters is, in essence, to prescribe a desired function of frequency for the filter as an attenuation {{of the signal}} when the filter is inserted between the terminations relative to the level {{that would have been}} received were the terminations connected to each other via an ideal transformer perfectly matching them. Versions of this theory are due to Sidney Darlington, Wilhelm Cauer and others all working more or less independently and is often taken as synonymous with network synthesis. Butterworth's filter implementation is, in those terms, an insertion-loss filter, but it is a relatively trivial one mathematically since the active amplifiers used by Butterworth ensured that each stage individually worked into a resistive load. Butterworth's filter becomes a non-trivial example when it is implemented entirely with passive components. An even earlier filter which influenced the insertion-loss method was Norton's dual-band filter where the input of two filters are connected in parallel and designed so that the combined input presents a constant resistance. Norton's design method, together with Cauer's canonical LC networks and Darlington's theorem that only LC components were required <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> filter resulted in the insertion-loss method. However, ladder topology proved to be more practical than Cauer's canonical forms.|$|E

25|$|Additional Dora-related {{proceedings}} {{were held}} both {{during and after}} the Dora Trial. Between late-October and mid-December 1947, short trials were held against 14 lower-level defendants, mostly SS-TV Guards. These resulted in 4 convictions and 1 acquittal, with the remaining 9 cases dropped for lack of evidence or available witnesses. Violent crimes still extant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> facts resulted in several more trials of individual cases in both West Germany and East Germany. The most public and important occurred in Essen between 1968 and 1970, resulting in 2 convictions.|$|E

25|$|Writer Steve Englehart {{revisited}} the Mockingbird and Hawkeye {{marriage in}} the 2001 miniseries Fantastic Four: Big Town. Set {{in a world where}} the technological advances of Reed Richards have filtered down throughout society the series shows Mockingbird and Hawkeye as newlyweds and members of the Manhattan-based Avengers. Their relationship comes under familiar strain when Mockingbird kills an assailant in defence of her husband and Hawkeye disapproves of her actions, questioning their necessity. Later in the story Mockingbird refrains from killing Quicksilver who then goes on to kill Hawkeye. At the story’s end the Avengers consider reviving Barton by placing his brain patterns <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> android Vision.|$|E

25|$|A flute {{produces}} {{sound when}} {{a stream of}} air directed across {{a hole in the}} instrument creates a vibration of air at the hole. The airstream creates a Bernoulli or siphon. This excites the air contained in the usually cylindrical resonant cavity within the flute. The flutist changes the pitch of the sound produced by opening and closing holes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instrument, thus changing the effective length of the resonator and its corresponding resonant frequency. By varying the air pressure, a flutist can also change the pitch by causing the air in the flute to resonate at a harmonic rather than the fundamental frequency without opening or closing any holes.|$|E
25|$|The {{movement}} of mites within {{and on the}} skin produces an intense itch, which has {{the characteristics of a}} delayed cell-mediated inflammatory response to allergens. IgE antibodies are present in the serum and the site of infection, which react to multiple protein allergens <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mite. Some of these cross-react to allergens from house dust mites. Immediate antibody-mediated allergic reactions (wheals) have been elicited in infected persons, but not in healthy persons; immediate hypersensitivity of this type is thought to explain the observed far more rapid allergic skin response to reinfection seen in persons having been previously infected (especially having been infected within the previous year or two).|$|E
25|$|An {{error in}} {{the first volume of}} the series led to a long-running under-estimate of the number of New Zealanders who fought in the Gallipoli Campaign. In his {{introduction}} to The New Zealanders at Gallipoli, Sir Ian Hamilton stated that 8,556 New Zealanders had served at Gallipoli. While this figure did not appear <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book, which did not provide an alternative, it was frequently repeated by historians until the 1980s. A 2005 book by Richard Stowers included an estimate that the actual figure was 13,977. In 2013, David Green determined that Hamilton had calculated his figure from a mistaken interpretation of tables in The New Zealanders at Gallipoli. Research by New Zealand Government agencies published in 2016, found that the number of New Zealanders landed at Gallipoli was approximately 16,000.|$|E
40|$|A 22 {{years old}} under {{graduate}} with recurrent hypoglycemia {{was found to}} have an insulinoma after investigations. Diagnosis of insulinoma had been made by elevated C-peptide and insulin concentration with simultaneous hypoglycemia with blood glucose 35 mg/dl. Preoperative computed tomography localized a single tumor (7 mm x 7 mm x 7 mm) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> pancreas. On surgical exploration with intraoperative ultrasound localization a tumor was found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> pancreas and enucleated. Repeat intraoperative ultrasonography showed no residual disease, but palpation localized a second lesion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> pancreas and that was enucleated. Patient made a complete recovery. Screening for MEN I indicated that patient has several features of MEN I which remains occult at present. This case highlights a rare clinical problem of multiple insulinomas and also importance of intraoperative palpation...|$|R
