One {{example of this}} phenomenon is when a set of observations is thought {{to come from a}} single normal distribution, but in fact comes from a mixture normals with different means. A second example is when the data is thought to come from an exponential distribution, but actually comes from a <b>gamma</b> <b>distribution.</b> In the latter case, smaller spacings may occur in the lower tail.

We derive also the information {{geometry of the}} 3 -manifold of McKay bivariate <b>gamma</b> <b>distributions,</b> which can provide a metrization of departures from randomness and departures from independence for bivariate processes. The curvature objects are derived, including those on three submanifolds.
