The FTIR {{results indicated that the}} external surface of the silicone rubber CT <b>insulation</b> <b>bushing</b> suffered from more serious aging than the internal part, fracture of side chain Si–C bond was much more than the backbone. Mechanical properties and thermal stability results illustrated that the main aging reasons were the breakage of side chain Si–C bond and the excessive cross-linking reaction of the backbone.

40|$|Abstract. Power {{transformer}} {{is the key}} {{equipment in}} power system. In view of {{the issues of the}} current bushing monitoring method, a new detection method of <b>bushing</b> <b>insulation</b> defects is proposed in this paper. According to the internal structure of <b>bushing,</b> the internal <b>insulation</b> defects are divided into three categories, including partial moisture, pollution, local insulation defects, the outer <b>insulation</b> of the <b>bushing</b> is equivalent to a resistance chain model. The entire <b>bushing</b> <b>insulation</b> is considered as a parallel between inner insulation and external insulation (inner Insulation is the main). This detection makes uses of the transient voltage measured from transformer bushing and the transient current measured from the end shield down-lead as the signal source. The reference data dynamically generated is used to diagnosis and distinguish Insulation defects of Transformer bushing, according to the monitoring data of the bushing and the maximum of the reference data, the type of the <b>bushing</b> <b>insulation</b> defect and the severity can be sentenced.

30|$|In this paper, SAS 550 CT <b>insulation</b> <b>bushing</b> (MWB Shanghai Transformer Co., Ltd.) {{used for}} 8  years from a 500  kV AC {{substation}} was investigated {{by means of}} several different test methods {{on the basis of}} previous work in our group (Wang et al. 2011 a, b; Tan et al. 2013). Characteristics including Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, mechanical property analysis, hardness, and thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) have been carried out on the external surface and internal samples of the silicone rubber CT <b>insulation</b> <b>bushing</b> in different parts to study the change of molecular structure and ageing state.|$|E
30|$|As {{shown in}} Table  1, the tensile {{strength}} {{on the surface}} parts of the silicone rubber CT <b>insulation</b> <b>bushing</b> are significantly {{lower than those of}} internal parts. The change in the bottom part is the most obvious. In the case of the bottom part of the silicone rubber CT <b>insulation</b> <b>bushing,</b> the tensile strength decreases remarkably from 2.88 to 1.87  MPa when S 2 (internal sample) compared with S 1 (surface sample). Similarly, the tensile strength decreases from 2.55 to 2.08  MPa when S 4 compared with S 3, and the tensile strength decreases from 2.66 to 2.60  MPa when S 6 compared with S 5. The elongation at break of the silicone rubber CT <b>insulation</b> <b>bushing</b> sharply decreases from 267 to  217  % when the comparison is made between the internal sample (S 2) and surface sample (S 1). Whereas for S 3 compared with S 4, and S 5 compared with S 6, elongation at break values almost do not change. During the ageing course of polymer materials, chain scission, degradation, and cross-linking reactions may occur. In general case, tensile strength and elongation at break of polymer materials could decline after ageing. In this article, fracture and degradation of the side-chain groups and backbone of the silicone rubber result in reduction in tensile strength. When polymer materials are cross-linked, elongation at break will increase with the improvement of cross-linkage degree. If the degree of cross-linking continues to improve, excessive cross-linking will result in a decline in the elongation at break. The elongation at break of S 1 is greatly reduced compared with S 2, whereas S 3 between S 4 and S 5 between S 6 show little change, which illustrate that the degree of cross-linking of S 1 is the maximum. Mechanical test results show that the surface parts of the silicone rubber CT <b>insulation</b> <b>bushing</b> have undergone serious ageing, ageing extent of S 1 is the most severe. These results are in accordance with the FTIR results.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This {{research}} {{presents a}} design of transformer <b>bushing</b> <b>insulation</b> at high-voltage wire connection side. The bushing insulator {{is made from}} composite materials between natural rubber(NR) and high-density polyethylene(HDPE). HDPE {{has been used to}} increase a weather resistance properties of natural rubber such as ultraviolet resistance, temperature and heat resistance etc. The blend ratio of materials is natural rubber 60 % and HDPE 40 %. To study properties of insulator material, it is tested by using ASTM D 2240, ASTM D 412, ASTM D 257 - 99 and ASTM D 149 - 05 standard. The test results shown that the composite material has a tensile strength equal to 4. 28 ± 5. 4 MPa, volume resistivity more than 2. 14 × 1016 Ω- cm and surface resistivity about 5. 56 × 1016 Ω/square. This insulation material can be withstanding a maximum AC power frequency voltage about 19. 7 kV/mm. In additional to design, we used a finite element method(FEM) to analyze the electric field distribution around the bushing insulator. The highest electric field strength occurs at wire connector and equal to 0. 95 kV/mm.

40|$|Transpower {{owns and}} {{operates}} New Zealand’s high voltage electricity grid which includes approximately 725 in service power transformers [1]. Presently, condition monitoring of these units is routinely carried out by oil testing (moisture, acidity and dielectric breakdown) and using dissolved gas analysis (DGA), (every year), and winding resistance, <b>insulation</b> resistance, and <b>bushing</b> power factor tests (every four years). However, since {{the average age of}} a power transformer in New Zealand is nearly 40 years [1], it is considered that online condition monitoring of important transformers or transformers that have known issues is carried out to identify any incipient faults. The online condition monitoring in existing power transformers is hoped to minimize the risk of sudden failures and thereby prolong the in service life. It is equally important to decide on what to monitor in a power transformer and how to monitor, and these are also governed by the budgetary constraints. Transpower {{is in the process of}} acquiring online condition monitoring units for some of the new large power transformers it plans to purchase and will also retrofit such units to some old transformers as required.

30|$|As can be {{seen from}} the TG curves of the {{silicone}} rubber CT <b>insulation</b> <b>bushing</b> samples in Fig.  4, the thermal degradation of silicone rubber system takes two mass loss steps. The first step during the temperature range from 370 to 650  °C is attributed to the thermal decomposition of the side-chain groups of the silicone rubber. The other might be ascribed to the thermal degradation of the backbone during 650 – 800  °C. The decomposition process is characterized by the initial and maximum degradation temperatures, as summarized in Table  3. Tonset is the initial decomposition temperature, Tmax is the temperature of the maximum rate of decomposition. Below 420  °C, inner parts of the silicone rubber have not exhibited weight loss, indicating that the molecular structure has not changed and ageing has not happened. For the surface parts of the silicone rubber, decomposition begins from 370  °C, it might be attributed to the thermal degradation of small molecules derived from side-chain groups. For instance, Tonset (375.1  °C) and Tmax (425.2  °C) of S 1 is lower than that of S 2 (427.2, 665.2  °C respectively), indicating that surface parts of the silicone rubber have suffered to ageing worse than the internal samples. Table  3 also lists the residues at 800  °C, the values of the surface parts are higher than those of the inner parts. This is because surface parts of the silicone rubber CT <b>insulation</b> <b>bushing</b> have suffered to ageing due to sun exposure, ultraviolet radiation, corona discharge, and high leakage current in 8  years’ service duration. For the surface parts of the silicone rubber CT <b>insulation</b> <b>bushing,</b> a certain amount of organic materials had already been decomposed in long service time, they were lost as CO 2 and H 2 O, remaining a large amount of inorganic filler materials in solid state and unchanged on heating. So the weight loss of surface parts in TG analysis should be smaller. Also TGA results are consistent with the results of mechanical properties and FTIR analysis.|$|E
30|$|In Fig.  3, all the {{absorption}} peaks at 3000  cm− 1 (–CH 3), 1255  cm− 1 (Si–CH 3), 1000 – 1100  cm− 1 (Si–O–Si), and 800  cm− 1 (Si–(CH 3) 2) {{of the external}} surface of the silicone rubber <b>insulation</b> <b>bushing</b> are much {{lower than those of}} internal ones, proving the reduction of Si–O and Si–C bond. In addition, the results reflect an important characteristic of the degradation of the silicone rubber insulation bushing: absorption peaks of Si–C bond decline much faster than absorption peaks of Si–O bond, which demonstrates that the fracture on the side-chain groups (mainly Si–(CH 3) 2) are much more than the backbone of the silicone rubber (Chen et al. 2015).|$|E
30|$|All {{the samples}} {{involved}} in this paper were collected from a SAS 550 current transformer (MWB Shanghai Transformer Co., Ltd.) from a 500  kV AC substation which was manufactured in Dec. 2004 and have been in service for 8  years. The samples were collected from surface and inner of the silicone rubber <b>insulation</b> <b>bushing,</b> including the top part, middle part and bottom part, 6 types of samples were obtained: external surface of the bottom part, inner of the bottom part, external surface of the middle part, inner of the middle part, external surface of the top part, inner of the top part, they were named as S 1, S 2, S 3, S 4, S 5, S 6, respectively.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} on-line monitoring for condenser type bushing of power transformer in order to detect a degradation of bushing and to provide the alarm before bushing failure. For the bushing degradation analysis, the capacitance and power factor of <b>bushing</b> internal <b>insulation</b> are on-line monitored and measured by installing the sensing device at the test tap of bushing. The changing of internal insulation capacitance leads to the change of voltage across tap capacitor and the change of leakage current through <b>bushing</b> <b>insulation</b> at the test tab. Such changes result in the change of power factor or phase angle of leakage current. Thus, the leakage current is additionally detected by installing the Hall Effect sensing device to observe the trend of bushing failure. A total of eight cases of both normal and degraded insulation are investigated. The internal insulation capacitance {{as well as the}} magnitude and phase angle of three phase leakage current were measured and compared with the commissioning value or observed the increasing trend to set the alarm level. In case of degraded bushing, the leakage currents changed and caused the summation of leakage current value to be greater than the standard value. Then the alarm is activated. This knowledge was used to develop the detection and decision making algorithms in LabVIEW program to determine the condition of transformer bushing...|$|R
40|$|Development of {{the power}} gridtowards a more {{reliable}} and smarter system requires frequent on-line monitoring {{of the power}} components. Power transformers and their bushings are particularly important components in a power transmission system and their insulation degradation may lead to catastrophic failures. Time consuming and costly replacement of these components raise {{the importance of their}} frequent monitoring. A fault in a power transformer bushing can also involve in the failure of the transformer. Therefore, on-line diagnostics of power transformers and their bushings is of great interest. Several methods exist for diagnostics of these components. However, some of them can only be done off-line in maintenance periods, and the existing on-line methods generally provide less information, especially on the internal solid insulation parts. In this project, a new technique for on-line diagnostics of the power transformer and the <b>bushing</b> <b>insulation</b> is proposed. In this technique, natural transients happening in the power system such as lightning and switching surges can be used as stimuli for on-line dielectric response measurements. This technique can provide information on insulation close to what Dielectric Spectroscopy offers in off-line measurements. The wide-ranging frequency content of power system transients is their advantage for being usedas stimuli when measuring the Dielectric Response. The response can have particular signatures due to different types of defects in the insulation varying with frequency. Oil-impregnated paper as a major insulation component in power transformer and its bushing has been investigated in this project. Moisture content and temperature, as two important degradation factors in this type of insulation, have been studied to evaluate the performance of the proposed technique in the diagnostics of the oil-impregnated paper. The results are verified with the dielectric response obtained through commercial instruments. The results show that the proposed technique has the ability to track the changes in dielectric response due to the moisture content and temperature. Measurements were done at both highvoltage (40 kV) and low voltage (10 V) levels, and the corresponding circuit models to achieve reasonable accuracy for the results are discussed. Moving on from the material samples, a further study was done on three service-aged 150 kV bushings to investigate the feasibility of the technique on the diagnostics of power transformer bushings. Their dielectric response measured by the transient stimuli showed good agreement with their response obtained by the commercial instruments. The effect of the transformer winding on the transient response of the bushing is a further aspect of the real conditions for on-line diagnostics. This has been investigated through the simulation of transient models for transformers and bushings, and possible solutions for distinguishing the responses are presented. The proposed new on-line diagnostics technique by utilizing natural transients can provide information about the insulation system in a certain range of frequency without interrupting the operation or requiring an external voltage source. However, the validity range of the results depends on the bandwidth of the applied transients and other measurement considerations. This approach can be valuable in frequent monitoring of dielectric properties of the power transformers and their bushings as a complement to the other available on-line techniques.
