5|$|In these diseases, {{antibodies}} {{are mainly}} directed against {{two of the}} proteins of the complex, called PM/Scl-100 (the RNase D like protein) and PM/Scl-75 (one of the RNase PH like proteins from the ring) and antibodies recognizing these proteins are found in approximately 30% of patients with the PM/Scl overlap syndrome. Although these two proteins are the main target of the autoantibodies, other exosome subunits and associated proteins (like C1D) can be targeted in these patients. At the current time, the most sensitive way to detect these antibodies is by using a peptide, derived from the PM/Scl-100 protein, as the antigen in an ELISA, instead of complete proteins. By this method, autoantibodies are found in up to 55% of patients with the PM/Scl overlap syndrome, {{but they can also}} be detected in patients suffering from either scleroderma, polymyositis, or <b>dermatomyositis</b> alone.|$|E
5|$|The exosome {{complex is}} the target of autoantibodies in {{patients}} suffering from various autoimmune diseases. These autoantibodies are mainly found in people that suffer from the PM/Scl overlap syndrome, an autoimmune disease in which patients have symptoms from both scleroderma and either polymyositis or <b>dermatomyositis.</b> Autoantibodies can be detected in the serum of patients {{by a variety of}} assays. In the past, the most commonly used methods were double immunodiffusion using calf thymus extracts, immunofluorescence on HEp-2 cells or immunoprecipitation from human cell extracts. In immunoprecipitation assays with sera from anti-exosome positive sera, a distinctive set of proteins is precipitated. Already years before the exosome complex was identified, this pattern was termed the PM/Scl complex. Immunofluorescence using sera from these patients usually shows a typical staining of the nucleolus of cells, which sparked the suggestion that the antigen recognized by autoantibodies might be important in ribosome synthesis. More recently, recombinant exosome proteins have become available and these have been used to develop line immunoassays (LIAs) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for detecting these antibodies.|$|E

25|$|ANAs {{are found}} in many {{disorders}}, {{as well as some}} healthy individuals. These disorders include: systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome, scleroderma, polymyositis, <b>dermatomyositis,</b> primary biliary cirrhosis, drug induced lupus, autoimmune hepatitis, multiple sclerosis, discoid lupus, thyroid disease, antiphospholipid syndrome, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, juvenile <b>dermatomyositis,</b> idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpura, infection and cancer. These antibodies can be subdivided according to their specificity, and each subset has different propensities for specific disorders.|$|E
25|$|According {{to their}} findings, {{presented}} at the University of Bologna in 2010, Callas had <b>dermatomyositis,</b> a disease that causes {{a failure of the}} muscles and tissues, including the larynx. They believe she was showing signs of this disease as early as the 1960s. Fussi and Paolillo cite an initial report by physician Mario Giacovazzo, who in 2002 revealed he had diagnosed Callas with <b>dermatomyositis</b> in 1975. Treatment includes corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents, which affect heart function.|$|E
25|$|Systemic {{autoimmune}} diseases include SLE, Sjögren's syndrome, sarcoidosis, scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, and <b>dermatomyositis.</b> These conditions tend to {{be associated}} with autoantibodies to antigens which are not tissue specific. Thus although polymyositis is more or less tissue specific in presentation, it may be included in this group because the autoantigens are often ubiquitous t-RNA synthetases.|$|E
25|$|Although anti-Jo-1 {{antibodies}} {{are often}} included with ANAs, {{they are actually}} antibodies to the cytoplasmic protein, histidyl tRNA synthetase. They are highly associated with polymyositis and <b>dermatomyositis,</b> and are rarely found in other connective tissue diseases. Around 20–40% of polymyositis is positive for Jo-1 antibodies and most will have interstitial lung disease, HLA-DR3 and HLA-DRw52 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) markers; collectively known as Jo-1 syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Inflammatory {{disorders}} {{may include}} musculoskeletal complaints, especially arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, polymyositis, <b>dermatomyositis,</b> osteoarthritis, dental pain, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain, spondylarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, gout attacks, and pain management {{in cases of}} kidney stones and gallstones. An additional indication is the treatment of acute migraines. Diclofenac is used commonly to treat mild to moderate postoperative or post-traumatic pain, in particular when inflammation is also present, and is effective against menstrual pain and endometriosis.|$|E
25|$|Scleroderma, polymyositis, and <b>dermatomyositis</b> elicit {{little or}} no CRP response. CRP levels also tend not to be {{elevated}} in SLE unless serositis or synovitis is present. Elevations of CRP {{in the absence of}} clinically significant inflammation can occur in renal failure. CRP level is an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic disease. Patients with high CRP concentrations are more likely to develop stroke, myocardial infarction, and severe peripheral vascular disease. Elevated level of CRP can also be observed in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.|$|E
500|$|Olivier {{spent the}} last 15 {{years of his life}} in {{securing}} his finances and dealing with deteriorating health, which included thrombosis and <b>dermatomyositis,</b> a degenerative muscle disorder. Professionally, and to provide financial security, he made a series of advertisements for Polaroid cameras in 1972, although he stipulated that they must never be shown in Britain; he also took a number of cameo film roles, which were in [...] "often undistinguished films", according to Billington. Olivier's move from leading parts to supporting and cameo roles came about because his poor health meant he could not get the necessary long insurance for larger parts, with only short engagements in films available.|$|E
500|$|Olivier's <b>dermatomyositis</b> {{meant he}} spent {{the last three months}} of 1974 in hospital, and he spent early 1975 slowly {{recovering}} and regaining his strength. When strong enough, he was contacted by the director John Schlesinger, who offered him the role of a Nazi torturer in the 1976 film Marathon Man. Olivier shaved his pate and wore oversized glasses to enlarge the look of his eyes, in a role that the critic David Robinson, writing for The Times, thought was [...] "strongly played", adding that Olivier was [...] "always at his best in roles that call for him to be seedy or nasty or both". Olivier was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, and won the Golden Globe of the same category.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Dermatomyositis</b> {{may occur}} {{at the age of}} 4 to 6 months, and is {{frequently}} misdiagnosed by general practice veterinarians as sarcoptic or demodectic mange. [...] The disease manifests itself as alopecia {{on the top of the}} head, supra- and suborbital area and forearms as well as the tip of the tail. [...] If the disease progresses to its more damaging form, it could affect the autonomic nervous system and the dog may have to be euthanised. [...] This disease is generation-skipping and genetically transmitted, with breeders having no clear methodology for screening except clear bloodline records. [...] Deep tissue biopsies are required to definitively diagnose <b>dermatomyositis.</b> [...] Lay assessment of end-stage <b>dermatomyositis</b> is observed difficulty or inability to swallow, even water. [...] At this point, the dog must be euthanised.|$|E
2500|$|Fussi and Paolillo also {{examined}} restored {{footage of the}} infamous 1958 Norma [...] "walkout" [...] in Rome, which led to harsh criticism of Callas as a temperamental superstar. By applying spectrographic analysis to that footage, the researchers observed her voice was tired and she lacked control. She really did have the bronchitis and tracheitis she claimed, and the <b>dermatomyositis</b> was already causing her muscles to deteriorate.|$|E
2500|$|Callas {{spent her}} last years living largely in {{isolation}} in Paris {{and died of}} a heart attack at age 53 on September 16, 1977. Heart failure is a possible outcome of <b>dermatomyositis</b> or side effect of the steroids and immunosuppressants which she took for the disease. Another explanation offered is that Callas's death was due to heart failure brought on by (possibly unintentional) overuse of Mandrax (methaqualone), a sleeping aid.|$|E
2500|$|Autoimmunity is {{the system}} of immune {{responses}} of an organism against its own healthy cells and tissues. Any disease that results from such an aberrant immune response is termed an [...] "autoimmune disease". Prominent examples include celiac disease, diabetes mellitus type 1, sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren's syndrome, [...] eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves' disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, Addison's disease, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis, polymyositis (PM), <b>dermatomyositis</b> (DM) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Autoimmune diseases are very often treated with steroids.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{best known}} as the cause of {{infectious}} mononucleosis (glandular fever). It is also associated with particular forms of cancer, such as Hodgkin's lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, gastric cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and conditions associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), such as hairy leukoplakia and central nervous system lymphomas. There is evidence that infection with EBV is associated with a higher risk of certain autoimmune diseases, especially <b>dermatomyositis,</b> systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome, and multiple sclerosis. [...] Some 200,000 cancer cases per year are thought to be attributable to EBV.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} subtypes of ANAs such as anti-Ro {{antibodies}}, anti-La antibodies, anti-Sm antibodies, anti-nRNP antibodies, anti-Scl-70 antibodies, anti-dsDNA antibodies, anti-histone antibodies, antibodies to nuclear pore complexes, [...] anti-centromere antibodies and anti-sp100 antibodies. Each of these antibody subtypes binds to different proteins or protein complexes within the nucleus. They {{are found in}} many disorders including autoimmunity, cancer and infection, with different prevalences of antibodies depending on the condition. This allows the use of ANAs in the diagnosis of some autoimmune disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's syndrome, scleroderma, mixed connective tissue disease, polymyositis, <b>dermatomyositis,</b> autoimmune hepatitis and drug induced lupus.|$|E
2500|$|Lovastatin {{is usually}} well tolerated, {{with the most}} common side effects being, in {{approximately}} descending order of frequency: creatine phosphokinase elevation, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhoea, muscle aches or pains, nausea, indigestion, weakness, blurred vision, rash, dizziness and muscle cramps. As with all statin drugs, it can rarely cause myopathy, hepatotoxicity (liver damage), <b>dermatomyositis</b> or rhabdomyolysis. This can be life-threatening if not recognised and treated in time, so any unexplained muscle pain or weakness whilst on lovastatin should be promptly mentioned to the prescribing doctor. Other uncommon side effects that should be promptly mentioned to either the prescribing doctor or an emergency medical service include: ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{is used as}} a disease-modifying {{treatment}} for some autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile <b>dermatomyositis,</b> psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, lupus, sarcoidosis, Crohn's disease (although a recent review has raised the point that it is fairly underused in Crohn's disease), eczema and many forms of vasculitis. Although originally designed as a chemotherapy drug (using high doses), in low doses, methotrexate is a generally safe and well tolerated drug in the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases. Because of its effectiveness, low-dose methotrexate is now first-line therapy for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Weekly doses are beneficial for 12 to 52 weeks duration therapy, although discontinuation rates are as high as 16% due to adverse effects. [...] Although methotrexate for autoimmune diseases is taken in lower doses than it is for cancer, side effects such as hair loss, nausea, headaches, and skin pigmentation are still common. Use of low doses of methotrexate together with NSAIDS such as aspirin or analgesics such as paracetamol is relatively safe in people being treated for rheumatoid arthritis, if adequate monitoring is done.|$|E

Options include medication, physical therapy, exercise, heat therapy (including microwave and ultrasound), orthotics and assistive devices, and rest. The standard treatment for <b>dermatomyositis</b> is a corticosteroid drug, given either in pill form or intravenously. Immunosuppressant drugs, such as azathioprine and methotrexate, may reduce inflammation in {{people who do not}} respond well to prednisone.
