25|$|Returning to the US, {{the newlyweds}} shared Webster's {{apartment}} overlooking Central Park and McKinney's Tymor farm, in Dutchess County, New York. In November 1915, Dear Enemy, {{a sequel to}} Daddy-Long-Legs, was published, and it too {{proved to be a}} bestseller. Also epistolary in form, it chronicles the adventures of a college friend of Judy's who becomes the superintendent of the orphanage in which Judy was raised. Webster became pregnant and according to family tradition, was warned that her pregnancy might be dangerous. She suffered severely from morning sickness, but by February 1916 was feeling better and was able to return to her many activities: social events, prison visits, and meetings about orphanage reform and women's suffrage. She also began a book and play set in Sri Lanka. Her friends reported that they <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> happier.|$|E
25|$|Sarada Devi {{received}} the highest reverence from the Ramakrishna Order and its devotees. Ramakrishna had bade her continue his mission {{after his death}} and wanted his disciples not to make any distinction between himself and her. According to her devotees and traditional biographers, the hospitality of Sarada Devi was unique and was characterised by motherly care and solicitude. Traditional accounts recount the mystical experiences of her devotees. Some dreamt {{of her as a}} goddess in human form though they <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> picture before. Others reportedly {{received the}}ir initiation from her in their dream. One such example is of Girish Chandra Ghosh, the father of Bengali drama, who reportedly saw Sarada Devi in a dream when he was nineteen years old and received a mantra. When he met her many years later, to his astonishment she was the same person in the dream.|$|E
500|$|Presley's {{impact on}} him was {{likewise}} emphatic: [...] "I saw {{a cousin of}} mine dance to... 'Hound Dog' and I <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> get up and be moved so much by anything. It really impressed me, {{the power of the}} music. I started getting records immediately after that." [...] By the end of the following year he had taken up the ukulele and tea-chest bass, begun to participate in skiffle sessions with friends, and had started to play the piano; meanwhile his stage presentation of numbers by both Presley and Chuck Berry—complete with gyrations in tribute to the original artists—to his local Wolf Cub group was described as [...] "mesmerizing... like someone from another planet." [...] After taking his eleven-plus exam at the conclusion of his Burnt Ash Junior education, Bowie went to Bromley Technical High School.|$|E

500|$|On March 1, 1959, Katsura {{appeared}} on CBS' popular primetime television show, What's My Line? The show {{was in the}} format of a guessing game, in which a panel attempted to determine the line (occupation), {{or in the case}} of a famous [...] "mystery guest", the identity of the contestant. After she signed in using Japanese characters on a chalk board, show officials listed Katsura's occupation for the audience as [...] "Professional Billiard Player (World's Women's Champion)". Panelist Arlene Francis was successful in guessing Katsura's occupation, though she admitted that she had read about her but said she <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> picture. Later that month Katsura made a guest appearance on ABC's You Asked For It, going behind the scenes of westerns to show how television productions set up and filmed a covered wagon rolling over and crashing on cue. She appeared again on You Asked For It in a November 25, 1960 broadcast, this time operating in her bailiwick, demonstrating trick shots for the camera.|$|E
2500|$|Burtram {{testified that}} she may have {{inadvertently}} informed her father about her mother's boyfriend shortly before her death. [...] When questioned by the defense counsel, she supported the argument for voluntary manslaughter, testifying that she <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> father act violently or aggressively toward her mother.|$|E
2500|$|Reading {{the report}} of [...] "he thought {{her to be a}} harlot; for she had covered her face," [...] the Gemara {{questioned}} how that could be so, for the Rabbis considered covering one's face an act of modesty. Rabbi Eleazar explained that Tamar had covered her face in her father-in-law's house (and thus Judah <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> face and did not recognize her), for Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani said in the name of Rabbi Jonathan that every daughter-in-law who is modest in her father-in-law's house merits that kings and prophets should issue from her. In support of that proposition, the Gemara noted that kings descended from Tamar through David. And prophets descended from Tamar, as [...] says, [...] "The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz," [...] and Rabbi Levi taught that there is a tradition that Amoz was the brother of Amaziah the King of Judah, and thus a descendant of David and thus of Tamar..|$|E

6000|$|... "I deny it. I utterly deny it," [...] said Eleanor, {{jumping from}} her seat and {{literally}} flashing before Mr. Arabin, as {{she stood on the}} drawing-room floor. He <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> so excited, he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> look half so beautiful.|$|E

6000|$|Hawtrey {{looked at}} him sharply. [...] "I believe she would, but {{considering}} that you <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her,</b> I don't quite know why you should be sure of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{is a very}} {{pure and}} high spirit--a girl of {{wonderful}} beauty--so they say. I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> myself--she told me to-day that she would watch over you." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said; and then, {{finding that}} it was not {{possible}} that he should hear her through her veil, she raised it. She was very pale, and there was a look of painful care, almost of agony, round her mouth. He <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> look so pale,--but he said to himself {{at the same time that}} he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> look so beautiful.|$|E
60|$|That day {{she rode}} as I <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her,</b> risking her life, unmindful of her horse.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have sought}} her far and wide, year after year, over {{mountain}} and plain. She may be dead--she may be alive--but I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> nor {{heard of her}} from that day to this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This lady {{wants her}} ’usband," [...] ses the pot-man, {{pointing}} at me. [...] "He {{run away from}} her nine years ago, and now he says he <b>’as</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>’er</b> before. He ought to be ’ung." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; but she {{was obliged}} to live as her husband did; and I suppose she has taken kindly to it by this time. Ah, I {{recollect}} that I once accidentally offended <b>her,</b> and I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> since." ...|$|R
60|$|She withdrew {{her hands}} quickly, I <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> make so rapid a movement; and her cheeks flushed.|$|E
60|$|He <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> look {{or speak}} like that--her face so hard, her eyes so stabbing! And he recoiled dumbfounded.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nellie!" [...] he exclaimed, {{stopping}} short, with {{a joyful}} gaze of admiration, for he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> so {{like an angel}} before.|$|E
60|$|I sealed {{up those}} words, {{and gave them}} {{to her when she}} had come to herself again. I never heard from her in reply. I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> from that time to this. She knows she can trust me.|$|R
60|$|Rebecca {{started back}} {{a picture of}} consternation. In {{the course of this}} history we <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> lose her {{presence}} of mind; but she did now, and wept some of the most genuine tears that ever fell from her eyes.|$|R
25|$|There is {{debate between}} poskim whether the {{prohibition}} applies to a recorded voice, where the singer cannot be seen, where {{the woman is}} not known {{to the man who}} is listening and where he <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> or a picture of her.|$|R

"I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her</b> before," [...] {{continued}} Stacy, {{with business}} precision, [...] "although I {{and two other}} men are guardians of her property, and have saved it from the clutches of her husband. They {{told me she was}} handsome--and so she is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed I am not by {{any means}} {{indifferent}} about her; but--but, you know, I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>her,</b> and, to tell the plain truth, my anxiety about the boy drove her out of my mind for the moment. Have you found her?" ...|$|R
