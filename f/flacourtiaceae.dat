5|$|Okapis are herbivores, {{feeding on}} tree leaves and buds, grasses, ferns, fruits, and fungi. They prefer {{to feed in}} treefall gaps. Staple foods {{comprise}} shrubs and lianas. The main constituents of the diet are woody, dicotyledonous species; monocotyledonous plants are not eaten regularly. In the Ituri forest, the okapi feeds mainly upon the plant families Acanthaceae, Ebenaceae, Euphorbiaceae, <b>Flacourtiaceae,</b> Loganiaceae, Rubiaceae and Violaceae.|$|E
25|$|Some species migrate. Caterpillars are {{sometimes}} covered in spines. Host plants include Acanthaceae, Caprifoliaceae, Convolvulaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Fagaceae, <b>Flacourtiaceae,</b> Lamiaceae, Loranthaceae, Moraceae, Plantaginaceae, Poaceae, Rubiaceae, Rutaceae, Salicaceae, Sapindaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Urticaceae, and Verbenaceae.|$|E
25|$|Tropical canopy butterflies, the {{caterpillars}} {{often have}} head spines or projections. Mostly edible species, have some Batesian mimics.

40|$|Ryania speciosa is a grove {{belonging}} to the family <b>Flacourtiacea,</b> located in tropical climates in Central- and South- America. The Indigenous population used the plant, which contains toxic alkaloids, against cockroaches. In the forties the ground wood was used as insecticide against different pests. In {{the first version of}} annex 2 b from the EC regulation 2092 / 91, Ryania was still listed, but it was subsequently cancelled due to its lack of registration as a pesticide in any European country. In organic farming, only a few insecticides are allowed, but in orchards there is a permanent need to control larvae such as coddling moth, etc. The Italian Ministry of Agriculture initiated a survey to investigate the possibility of developing an 'organic' pesticide based on Ryania. Basic research was done, working on extraction methods, synergists, spectrum of action, degradation, and efficacy in comparison with other modern pesticides including ecotoxicological investigations. Organic fruit growers hope that a company takes on Ryania to pass it through the registration procedure and puts some formulations on the market...|$|R
2500|$|The {{group is}} {{difficult}} to characterize phenotypically, although members often have dentate leaves, with the teeth having [...] a single vein running into a congested and often deciduous apex (i.e., violoid, salicoid, or theoid). Also, zeylanol [...] has recently been discovered in Balanops and Dichapetalum [...] which are in the balanops clade (so-called Chrysobalanaceae s. l.). The so-called parietal suborder (the clusioid clade and Ochnaceae s. l. were also part of Parietales) corresponds with the traditional Violales as 8 (Achariaceae, Violaceae, <b>Flacourtiaceae,</b> Lacistemataceae, Scyphostegiaceae, Turneraceae, Malesherbiaceae, and Passifloraceae) of the order's 10 families along with Salicaceae, which have usually been assigned as a related order or suborder, are in this most derived malpighian suborder, so that eight of the 10 families of this suborder are Violales. The <b>Flacourtiaceae</b> family {{has proven to be}} polyphyletic as the cyanogenic members have been placed in Achariaceae and the ones with salicoid teeth were transferred to Salicaceae.|$|E
