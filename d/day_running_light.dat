25|$|The Dacia {{designers}} {{wanted to}} give a new look for the Dacia models and the front side comes with several new features. The front and back bumpers have been slightly redesigned and the headlights have a new design that includes LED <b>day</b> <b>running</b> <b>lights</b> (it {{is the first time}} that Dacia models offer LED lights).The aesthetic package is completed by a new front grille, similar to the one found on the Duster.|$|R

50|$|The safety {{features}} included are: <b>day</b> <b>running</b> full LED <b>lights,</b> parking assist with audio warnings and a rear-view camera which provides live video {{from the rear}} of the car to make the driver aware of obstacles when reversing.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with the}} new safety {{features}} comes a slightly redesigned headlights with LED <b>day</b> time <b>running</b> <b>lights,</b> taillights, bumpers, as well as interior, it also becomes the first Toyota to have 360 degree 99% UV cut glass preventing 99% of UV rays from entering into the vehicle creating a cooler environment overall, this 99% UV cut glass also gets a recommendation from Skin Cancer Foundation and has a SPF 50+/PA++++ rating. However, with the gain of its new looks and safety equipment the Estima drops its 3.5L V6 and now only offers the 2.4L inline 4 producing , and 224 Nm and its hybrid variant.|$|R
5000|$|For 1995, a driver's-side air bag {{was added}} {{as well as}} <b>day</b> time <b>running</b> <b>lights.</b> In 1996 the 4.3 L engine was refreshed, and a third (rear) door was added for {{extended}} cab models, along with the sportside bed option. In 1998, the exterior, interior, brakes, and 2.2 L I4 engine were refreshed, along with a [...] "next-generation" [...] supplemental restraint system that added a passenger-side air bag. [...] "Auto-Trac" [...] all-wheel drive also became an option starting in 1999 for the 4WD Blazers. The SS package {{was replaced by the}} [...] "Xtreme" [...] package. In 2001 a crew cab option was added and was available in 4WD and automatic transmission only. For the 2004 model year, the regular and extended cab models were discontinued; only the crew cab model was retained.|$|R
5000|$|Porsche first {{revealed}} the facelifted 2008 Boxster and Boxster S models at the Los Angeles International Auto Show in November 2008. Both models feature greater power {{due to an}} increase in engine displacement for the Boxster and the incorporation of Direct Fuel Injection (DFI) for the Boxster S. Both models are now available with Porsche's new 7-speed Porsche Doppelkupplungsgetriebe (PDK) dual clutch gearbox but come standard with a new 6-speed manual gearbox. Displacement in the standard Boxster's flat-six engine increased from 2.7 to 2.9 liters, increasing power from [...] to [...] Use of DFI in the Boxster S raised the output of the 3.4-litre engine from [...] to [...] Cosmetic changes to the 2009 Boxster and Boxster S include new head and tail lights, larger front air intakes with incorporated <b>day</b> time <b>running</b> <b>lights,</b> and an altered lower rear end flanked by twin diffusers. The interior includes the redesigned Porsche Communication Management System as an option with a touchscreen interface to reduce button clutter.|$|R
50|$|In theater, <b>running</b> <b>lights</b> are any {{lights that}} the {{audience}} does not see, but are on during a performance. They are different from worklights which are not used during a show. One type of <b>running</b> <b>light</b> is the lights set in wings or crossovers for actors and technicians {{to find their way}} in the (mostly) dark. These are usually rope lights or traditional fixtures with a colored lamp or colored gel over them. Booth staff will also use <b>running</b> <b>lights</b> to illuminate control boards or scripts. One brand marketed for this specific purpose is LittLite. Cue lights are distinct from <b>running</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|R
40|$|Daytime <b>running</b> <b>lights</b> {{increase}} visual {{contrast between}} vehicles and their background, improving their noticeability and detectability. Seven countries require motor vehicles to have lights on during all daytime periods [...] Canada, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. Studies from {{these and other}} countries have generally indicated that daytime <b>running</b> <b>lights</b> use is associated with small to moderate reductions in multiple-vehicle daytime crashes, especially those involving vehicles approaching from the front or side. There is evidence also that initial positive effects of daytime <b>running</b> <b>lights</b> do not dissipate over time, that is, there is little support for novelty or habituation effects. The bulk of {{the evidence suggests that}} <b>running</b> <b>lights</b> do not lead to increases in collisions involving pedestrians and pedalcyclists, allaying concerns that there would be negative consequences of making these road users relatively less conspicuous. Most of the studies have been conducted in countries located at latitudes that are to the north of most of the continental United States and that have longer twilight periods and generally lower ambient illumination. The concern has been expressed that <b>running</b> <b>lights</b> may lose their effectiveness in countries located at lower latitudes, such as the United States, because the lights will provide less of a contrast. General Motors Corporation and some other manufacturers are now providing <b>running</b> <b>lights</b> on new models with higher intensities than are used in Scandinavian countries. Findings in <b>running</b> <b>lights</b> studies suggest that their effect in the United States will be positive, and their introduction provides an opportunity to determine the effect. The costs of <b>running</b> <b>lights</b> are low, so even modest crash reductions would be cost effective...|$|R

It is emphasized that a light on the rear side is also desirable...|$|R

50|$|Electric tail <b>lights</b> and <b>running</b> <b>lights</b> were {{introduced}} to the subway with the Standards. Low <b>running</b> <b>lights</b> would display white {{at the front of the}} train, while tail lights displayed red in the rear. The lights adjusted automatically depending on the train's direction of travel. This was in contrast to the IRT practice of using kerosene lamps at the ends of trains, which had to be physically changed over when the train reversed direction at a terminal. At the time the Standards were delivered, the white <b>running</b> <b>lights</b> were deemed sufficient for lighting tunnels. However, during the 1950s, the New York City Subway made a system wide shift to sealed beam headlights to improve safety. Therefore, the Standards that received overhaul from 1958 to 1960 (cars 2400-2799 and 2899) received sealed beams.|$|R

The 2.5L engine with 170 hp carries over from the previous model.|$|R
50|$|Depending on {{prevailing}} {{regulations and}} vehicle equipment, the daytime <b>running</b> <b>light</b> function may be implemented by functionally specific lamps, by operating the low beam headlamps or fog lamps at full or reduced intensity, by operating the high-beam headlamps at reduced intensity, or by steady-burning {{operation of the}} front turn signals. Compared to any mode of headlamp operation to create the daytime <b>running</b> <b>light,</b> functionally dedicated DRLs maximize the potential benefits in safety performance and minimize fuel consumption, glare, motorcycle masking, and other potential drawbacks.|$|R
