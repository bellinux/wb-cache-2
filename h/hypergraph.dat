A <b>hypergraph</b> is said to be conformal if every maximal clique of its primal graph is a hyperedge, or equivalently, if every clique of its primal graph is contained in some hyperedge. If the <b>hypergraph</b> is required to be downward-closed (so it contains all hyperedges that are contained in some hyperedge) then the <b>hypergraph</b> is conformal precisely when it is a flag complex. This relates the language of hypergraphs to the language of simplicial complexes.|$|E

40|$|<b>Hypergraphs</b> are {{mathematical}} {{models for}} many problems in data sciences. In recent decades, the topological properties of <b>hypergraphs</b> {{have been studied}} and various kinds of (co) homologies have been constructed (cf. [3, 4, 12]). In this paper, generalising the usual homology of simplicial complexes, we define the embedded homology of <b>hypergraphs</b> {{as well as the}} persistent embedded homology of sequences of <b>hypergraphs.</b> As a generalisation of the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for the homology of simplicial complexes, we give a Mayer-Vietoris sequence for the embedded homology of <b>hypergraphs.</b> Moreover, as applications of the embedded homology, we study acyclic <b>hypergraphs</b> and construct some indices for the data analysis of hyper-networks.

500|$|In a {{conventional}} representation components {{are represented by}} edges, each of which connects to two nodes. [...] In a <b>hypergraph,</b> components are represented by hyperedges which can connect to an arbitrary number of nodes. [...] Hyperedges have tentacles which connect the hyperedge to the nodes. [...] The graphical representation of a hyperedge may be a box (compared to the edge which is a line) and the representations of its tentacles are lines from the box to the connected nodes. [...] In a directed <b>hypergraph,</b> the tentacles carry labels which {{are determined by the}} hyperedge's label. [...] A conventional directed graph {{can be thought of as}} a <b>hypergraph</b> with hyperedges each of which has two tentacles. [...] These two tentacles are labelled source and target and usually indicated by an arrow. [...] In a general <b>hypergraph</b> with more tentacles, more complex labelling will be required.|$|E
500|$|Hypergraphs can be characterised {{by their}} {{incidence}} matrices. [...] A regular graph containing only two-terminal components will have exactly two non-zero entries in each row. [...] Any incidence matrix {{with more than}} two non-zero entries in any row is a representation of a <b>hypergraph.</b> [...] The number of non-zero entries in a row is the rank of the corresponding branch, and the highest branch rank is the rank of the incidence matrix.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>hypergraph</b> is a {{combinatorial}} structure that, like an undirected graph, has vertices and edges, but {{in which}} the edges may be arbitrary sets of vertices {{rather than having to}} have exactly two endpoints. A bipartite graph [...] may be used to model a <b>hypergraph</b> in which [...] is the set of vertices of the <b>hypergraph,</b> [...] is the set of hyperedges, and [...] contains an edge from a <b>hypergraph</b> vertex [...] to a <b>hypergraph</b> edge [...] exactly when [...] is one of the endpoints of [...] Under this correspondence, the biadjacency matrices of bipartite graphs are exactly the incidence matrices of the corresponding hypergraphs. As a special case of this correspondence between bipartite graphs and hypergraphs, any multigraph (a graph {{in which the}}re may be two or more edges between the same two vertices) may be interpreted as a <b>hypergraph</b> in which some hyperedges have equal sets of endpoints, and represented by a bipartite graph that does not have multiple adjacencies and in which the vertices {{on one side of the}} bipartition all have degree two.|$|E
40|$|Despite of {{the extreme}} success of the {{spectral}} graph theory, there are relatively few papers applying spectral analysis to <b>hypergraphs.</b> Chung first introduced Laplacians for regular <b>hypergraphs</b> and showed some useful applications. Other researchers treated <b>hypergraphs</b> as weighted graphs and then studied the Laplacians of the corresponding weighted graphs. In this paper, we aim to unify these very different versions of Laplacians for <b>hypergraphs.</b> We introduce a set of Laplacians for <b>hypergraphs</b> through studying high-ordered random walks on <b>hypergraphs.</b> We prove the eigenvalues of these Laplacians can effectively control the mixing rate of high-ordered random walks, the generalized distances/diameters, and the edge expansions.

As a consequence, we obtain that de Bruijn-Kautz directed <b>hypergraphs</b> and, more generally, iterated line directed <b>hypergraphs</b> provide models for highly fault-tolerant directed bus networks...|$|R

2500|$|The theorem {{can also}} be {{extended}} to hypergraphs. An m-hypergraph is a graph whose [...] "edges" [...] are sets of m vertices – in a normal graph an edge {{is a set of}} 2 vertices. The full statement of Ramsey's theorem for hypergraphs is that for any integers m and c, and any integers n1, …, n'c, there is an integer R(n1, …, n'c;c, m) such that if the hyperedges of a complete m-hypergraph of order R(n1, …, n'c;c, m) are coloured with c different colours, then for some i between 1 and c, the <b>hypergraph</b> must contain a complete sub-m-hypergraph of order n'i whose hyperedges are all colour i. This theorem is usually proved by induction on m, the 'hyper-ness' of the graph. The base case for the proof is mnbsp&=nbsp&2, which is exactly the theorem above.|$|E
2500|$|... use {{interval}} thickness {{to model}} the number of tracks needed in a one-dimensional layout of a VLSI circuit, formed {{by a set of}} modules that need to be interconnected by a system of nets. In their model, one forms a graph in which the vertices represent nets, and in which two vertices are connected by an edge if their nets both connect to the same module; that is, if the modules and nets are interpreted as forming the nodes and hyperedges of a <b>hypergraph</b> then the graph formed from them is its line graph. An interval representation of a supergraph of this line graph, together with a coloring of the supergraph, describes an arrangement of the nets along a system of horizontal tracks (one track per color) {{in such a way that}} the modules can be placed along the tracks in a linear order and connect to the appropriate nets. The fact that interval graphs are perfect graphs implies that the number of colors needed, in an optimal arrangement of this type, is the same as the clique number of the interval completion of the net graph.|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to give a new, {{abstract}} approach to cover-decomposition and polychromatic colorings using <b>hypergraphs</b> on ordered vertex sets. We introduce an abstract version of a framework by Smorodinsky and Yuditsky, used for polychromatic coloring halfplanes, and apply it to so-called ABA-free <b>hypergraphs,</b> which are a generalization of interval graphs. Using our methods, we prove that (2 k- 1) -uniform ABA-free <b>hypergraphs</b> have a polychromatic k-coloring, a problem posed by the second author. We also prove the same for <b>hypergraphs</b> defined on a point set by pseudohalfplanes. These results are best possible. We could only prove slightly weaker results for dual <b>hypergraphs</b> defined by pseudohalfplanes, and for <b>hypergraphs</b> defined by pseudohalfspheres. We also introduce another new notion that seems to be important for investigating polychromatic colorings and epsilon-nets, shallow hitting sets. We show that all the above <b>hypergraphs</b> have shallow hitting sets, if their hyperedges are containment-free...|$|R

40|$|The present work {{deals with}} the {{matching}} and vertex cover problem in balanced <b>hypergraphs.</b> This class of <b>hypergraphs</b> is, according to the definition by Berge in the 70 s, one possible generalization of bipartite graphs. In the first chapter we define basic notions about graphs and <b>hypergraphs.</b> The next chapter {{deals with the}} class of balanced <b>hypergraphs.</b> At first we state some known coloring properties of balanced <b>hypergraphs</b> and investigate the matching problem in two important subclasses.

After that we give a new proof of König's Theorem for balanced <b>hypergraphs</b> and discuss further duality properties between matchings and vertex covers and give several new results, which {{can be interpreted as}} combinatorial formulations and strengthenings of the complementary slackness relation. In the following we investigate the associated polyhedra and outline how our ideas can be used to augment matchings algorithmically. The third chapter deals with the main results of this work - a new decomposition theory for balanced <b>hypergraphs.</b> We generalize the classical Gallai Edmonds decomposition of graphs to balanced <b>hypergraphs</b> in several different ways. Based on these decompositions we give a new, short, and combinatorial proof of Hall's theorem in balanced <b>hypergraphs</b> in chapter four.
