5000|$|It is {{perfectly}} consistent {{to say that}} a tax avoidance scheme escapes tax (there being no provision to impose a <b>tax</b> <b>charge)</b> and yet constitutes the avoidance of tax. One is seeking the intention of Parliament at a higher, more generalised level. A statute may fail to impose a <b>tax</b> <b>charge,</b> leaving a gap that a court cannot fill even by purposive construction, but nevertheless one can conclude that {{there would have been a}} <b>tax</b> <b>charge</b> had the point been considered. An example is the notorious UK case Ayrshire Employers Mutual Insurance Association v IRC, where the House of Lords held that Parliament had “missed fire”.|$|R
40|$|During {{the recent}} flat tax debate, {{interest}} rates on long-term municipal bonds rose relative to the rate on U. S. Treasury bonds. This was widely attributed to expectations of a reduction in <b>future</b> <b>tax</b> rates. While an axiom of finance states that current asset prices reflect expectations about future events, {{there is no consensus}} on how sensitive municipal bond yields are to expectations about <b>future</b> <b>tax</b> rates. This study assesses that question by examining the relationship between the implicit tax rate and actual <b>future</b> <b>tax</b> rates. > Efficient markets theory predicts that the implicit tax rate [...] the tax rate that equates the after-tax yield on a Treasury bond to the yield on a tax-exempt bond [...] will be an excellent predictor of <b>future</b> <b>tax</b> rates. The author finds that although the Efficient Markets prediction is not supported, implicit tax rates do contain some information about <b>future</b> <b>tax</b> rates. The information content in implicit tax rates is particularly high around the time of major tax debates that have resulted in significant changes in tax rates. At other times, including the flat tax debate of 1996 - 96, implicit tax rates carry little information about <b>future</b> <b>tax</b> rates. Forecasting; Municipal bonds; Taxation...|$|R

Deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from timing differences in the recognition of revenues and expenses based on financial accounting standards and tax laws. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are recognized in the financial statements because it can lead to <b>future</b> <b>tax</b> payments to be larger or smaller. Sample of this study consists of 38 companies from manufacturing sectors listed on Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2011 - 2014. Multiple regression analysis is used to determine the effect of each component of deferred tax assets and liabilities for <b>future</b> current <b>tax.</b> Data components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are taken from the Notes to the Financial Statements of the company. The results show that deferred tax assets of post-employment benefits has negatively significant and deferred tax liabilities of accelerated depreciation has negatively significant to <b>future</b> <b>tax.</b> This is due to the possibility of some companies samples to defer tax payments. While the results for the deferred tax assets of accrued expenses do not affect <b>future</b> <b>tax.</b> <b>Future</b> <b>taxes</b> paid related to the time reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities.

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} Ricardian {{equivalence}} of debt and tax finance {{in a world}} in which taxes are not lump-sum but are levied on risky labor income. First, we show that the marginal propensity to consume out of a tax cut, coupled with a <b>future</b> income <b>tax</b> increase, is positive under reasonable assumptions regarding preferences toward risk. Second, we document that the degree of income uncertainty facing the typical individual orfamily is large. Third, we show that, for plausible utility function parameters and distributions of future income, the MPC out of a tax cut is quantitatively large. Indeed, the MPC out of a tax cut, coupled with a <b>future</b> income <b>tax</b> increase, can be closer to the Keynesian value that ignores the <b>future</b> <b>tax</b> liabilities than to the Ricardian value that treats <b>future</b> <b>taxes</b> as if they were lump-sum. ...|$|R
