5|$|Although Morgan {{had been}} ordered to {{eradicate}} piracy from Jamaican waters, he continued his friendly relations with many privateer captains, and invested in some of their ships. Zahedieh estimates that there were 1,200 privateers operating in the Caribbean at the time, and Port Royal was their preferred destination. These had a welcome in the city if Morgan received the dues owed to him. As Morgan was {{no longer able to}} issue letters of marque to privateer captains, his brother-in-law, Robert Bindloss, directed them to the French governor of Tortuga to have a letter issued; Bindloss and Morgan received a commission <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>one</b> signed. Morgan was not entirely friendly to pirates and privateers; in 1681 he ordered an attack on Dutch buccaneer Jacob Evertson, capturing many of his crew (though Evertson escaped) and advertising the capture publicly.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the visuals and audio, the overall gameplay system remained mostly unchanged from that used since Final Fantasy V, using research done to promote player control. The initial decision was for battles to feature shifting camera angles. Battle arenas had a lower polygon count than field areas, which made picking out distinctive features <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>one</b> more difficult. The summon sequences benefited strongly from the switch to the cinematic style, as the team had struggled to portray their scale using 2D graphics. In his role as producer, Sakaguchi placed much of his effort into developing the battle system, also proposing the Materia system. Materia provided more character customization than previous Final Fantasy games: battles no longer revolved around characters with innate skills and roles in battle, as Materia could be reconfigured between battles. Nomura {{also contributed to the}} gameplay, creating the Limit Break system as an evolution of the Desperation Attacks used in Final Fantasy VI. The Limit Breaks served a purpose in gameplay while also bringing out each character's personality in battle.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for {{the river}} has resided {{with a number of}} legal bodies in the past. The first was the Rother Levels Commissioners of Sewers, who were {{established}} by letters patent issued under the provisions of the Statute of Sewers dated 1531. The lower river was also covered by the Rye Harbour Commissioners, after they were established by Act of Parliament in 1731. In 1872, the Board of Conservators for the River Rother was created to manage and protect stocks of fish in the river. As in many parts of Britain, the rights and duties of these various bodies competed and overlapped, and by the early twentieth century, the situation was chaotic. An attempt to resolve the confusion was made in 1930, with the passing of the Land Drainage Act 1930, under which 47 catchment areas were established, and a Catchment Board was then created <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>one,</b> with overall responsibility for that area. Thus the Rother and Jury's Gut Catchment Board was created. While the board had overall responsibility, local management of rivers and drainage was under the control of Internal Drainage Boards, and the transition was eased by reconstituting Commissioners of Sewers as Internal Drainage Boards, {{under the terms of the}} act.|$|E

Palaephatus, Ovid and Diodorus Siculus concur with Euripides, while Servius has the Hydra grow back three heads each time; the Suda does not give a number. Depictions of the monster dating to c. 500 BCE show it with a double tail as well as multiple heads, suggesting the same regenerative ability at work, but no literary accounts have this feature.|$|E
25|$|Other computer-generated {{imagery in}} the film {{includes}} the ant coming out of Dae-su's arm (according to the making-of on the DVD the whole arm was CGI) and the ants crawling over him afterwards.

Actor Choi Min-sik, a Buddhist, said a prayer <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>one.</b> The eating of squirming octopuses (called san-nakji (산낙지) in Korean) as a delicacy exists in East Asia, although it is usually killed and cut, not eaten whole and alive. Usually, it is the nerve activity in the octopus' tentacles makes the pieces still squirming posthumously on the plate when served. When asked in DVD commentary if he felt sorry for Choi, director Park Chan-wook stated he felt more sorry for the octopus.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{approach}} suggested by , Thomas Hales, {{then at the}} University of Michigan, determined that the maximum density of all arrangements could be found by minimizing a function with 150 variables. In 1992, assisted by his graduate student Samuel Ferguson, he embarked on a research program to systematically apply linear programming methods to find a lower bound {{on the value of}} this function <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>one</b> of a set of over 5,000 different configurations of spheres. If a lower bound (for the function value) could be found for every one of these configurations that was greater than the value of the function for the cubic close packing arrangement, then the Kepler conjecture would be proved. To find lower bounds for all cases involved solving about 100,000 linear programming problems.|$|E

25|$|Gazetteers {{are often}} {{categorized}} by the type, and scope, {{of the information}} presented.

Short-form gazetteers, often {{used in conjunction with}} computer mapping and GIS systems, may simply contain a list of place-names together with their locations in latitude and longitude or other spatial referencing systems (e.g.,British National Grid reference). Short-form gazetteers appear as a place–name index in the rear of major published atlases. Descriptive gazetteers may include lengthy textual descriptions of the places they contain, including explanation of industries, government, geography, together with historical perspectives, maps and/or photographs. Thematic gazetteers list places or geographical features by theme; for example fishing ports, nuclear power stations, or historic buildings. Their common element is that the geographical location is an important attribute of the features listed.|$|E
