50|$|CRDB is {{different}} from the other two national banks in that it primarily provides loans to microfinance institutions such as SACCOS (the largest type of MFI in this program). CRDB as a more conservative bank has taken this approach in order to reduce their risks in microfinance by loaning to groups such as SACCOs instead of micro and small enterprise borrowers. CRDB provides SACCOs with financial stability. CRDB's total assets are as of June 2003 US $370 million. Its total customer <b>deposits</b> <b>account</b> for US$330 million.

50|$|By {{transferring}} {{the ownership of}} deposits from one party to another, banks can avoid using physical cash {{as a method of}} payment. Commercial bank <b>deposits</b> <b>account</b> for most of the money supply in use today. For example, if a bank in the United States makes a loan to a customer by depositing the loan proceeds in that customer's checking account, the bank typically records this event by debiting an asset account on the bank's books (called loans receivable or some similar name) and credits the deposit liability or checking account of the customer on the bank's books. From an economic standpoint, the bank has essentially created economic money (although not legal tender). The customer's checking account balance has no dollar bills in it, as a demand deposit account is simply a liability owed by the bank to its customer. In this way, commercial banks are allowed to increase the money supply (without printing currency, or legal tender).|$|E

50|$|The {{number of}} {{eligibility}} criteria employed varies by the IDA program sponsor and their funding sources. Once recruited, participants open IDA accounts with the partnering financial institution and begin making <b>deposits.</b> <b>Account</b> holders generally make monthly contributions to an account, usually {{over a period}} of one to four years, and their savings are matched by donations typically at a rate ranging from 1:1 to 3:1. Match dollars for IDAs come from many different places, such as government agencies, private companies, churches, or local charities. Any individual, organization or business can contribute match dollars to IDAs. In most cases, donors can get a tax deduction for contributions to IDAs, and they are also recognized for helping others in their community. Each month, IDA participants receive a report telling them how much money is accumulating in their IDA, which is a sum of their individual savings, matched dollars and interest. Individual and matching deposits are never co-mingled; all matching dollars are kept in a separate, parallel account. When the IDA account holder has accumulated enough savings and matching funds to purchase the asset and has completed a required financial education course, payments from the IDA are made directly to the asset provider to complete the asset purchase.|$|E
40|$|Two piñon (Pinus edulis) tree-ring chronologies {{developed}} {{on each of}} three substrates (sandstone, shale, and alluvial fan deposits) in southern Utah for the period 1702 to 1997 demonstrate that geologic substrate affects dendrochronologic streamflow reconstructions. Chronologies from alluvial fan deposits explain the most variance of winter streamflow reconstruction (October 1 to May 31) with an adjusted coefficient of determination (Ra 2) equal to 0. 59. Chronologies from sandstone <b>deposits</b> <b>account</b> for 52 percent of the variance, while those on shale <b>deposits</b> <b>account</b> for 45 percent. Correlation coefficients among the three substrates are significantly different at the 95 % confidence level. The highest single-site annual discharge reconstruction (October 1 to September 30), Ra 2 = 0. 25, is provided by chronologies from shale deposits. The highest substrate-pair annual discharge reconstruction, Ra 2 = 0. 27, is provided by chronologies from alluvial fan deposits. The highest summer reconstruction (July 4 to September 3), Ra 2 = 0. 14, is provided by chronologies from sandstone. Over 90 percent of the summer reconstructions are below Ra 2 = 0. 10. The different substrate response is attributed to varying amounts of clay in each substrate affecting infiltration and available water for tree growth. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} an econometric {{analysis}} of three consumer banking accounts from Bank One Dayton, N. A., the Total Demand account, Total Savings account and Time <b>Deposits</b> <b>Account.</b> The elasticity of demand {{with respect to}} interest rates of the savings and time deposit accounts is determined using multiple regression modeling and analysis. Other variables that are significant determinants of the balances of each account are also presented. An analysis of the regression results for the Time Deposits Model indicates that the demand for the Bank One Dayton time deposit accounts (certificate of deposit accounts) is significantly elastic with respect to interest rate. In addition to the time deposit rate, personal income, recessionary economic periods, the unemployment rate and national small time deposit balances are all significant, positive determinants of time deposit balances. The percentage rate difference between the savings account rate and the time <b>deposits</b> <b>account</b> rate is a significant determinant of savings account demand {{and in this case}} a better indicator of demand elasticity with respect to rate than the savings rate. The elasticity of demand for savings with respect to the savings-time deposit rate is low. Increases in personal income and decreases in the savings-time deposit rate will positively effect savings account balances. The depositor’s demand for Demand deposit accounts is determined by factors that do not accrue interest to the account’s balances. Personal income is positively correlated with total demand balances but tax payments, recessionary periods, the spread between the time deposit and savings rate and the installment loan rate all negatively effect demand account balances. An increase in the time deposit-savings rate should encourage a flight of funds to time deposits as should a recessionary period in the economy...|$|E

We calculate actual and potential rates of water use and forest loss both in Canadian deposits, where oil sands extraction is already taking place, and in other major deposits worldwide. We estimated that their exploitation, given projected production trends, could result in 1. 31 km 3 yr− 1 of freshwater demand and 8700 km 2 of forest loss. The expected escalation in oil sands extraction thus portends extensive environmental impacts...|$|E

40|$|This paper uses {{data from}} a {{detailed}} 4 month PCB mass balance study on lactating cows fed a naturally contaminated background diet to quantify the metabolism and body-burdens {{of a range of}} PCB congeners. Dietary intake fluxes and milk and faecal output fluxes reported previously are combined with subcutaneous fat and blood PCB concentrations and with data from tissue/organ samples from a slaughtered animal to estimate the degree of metabolism within the cow. A total body burden is derived, showing that fat <b>deposits</b> <b>account</b> for 98 % of total PCB present in the lactating cow. The daily intake through feed (ng day− 1) accounted for between 0. 9 and 1. 5 % of the total body burden for persistent congeners (e. g. PCB 153) and up to 43 % for those congeners which are readily metabolised (e. g. PCB 52). Detailed balances for a range of tri- to octa-chlorinated PCBs are presented and clearly demonstrate that many congeners are metabolised effectively by lactating dairy cows (e. g. PCB 149) whilst others are efficiently transferred to human dairy food products. An approach to predicting the degree of metabolism for individual PCB congeners is presented which gives good agreement with observations...|$|E

40|$|Poland {{belongs to}} one of the last {{countries}} with native sulphur mining. Its history begun in 15 th century. Deposit area of Tarnobrzeg re-presents 80 % of all known sulphur reserves in this country. All of explored deposits in this area were created by metasomatic alteration of sulphur bearing limestones with sulphur mineralised liquids, which arised from melt gypsum. The average content is 25 - 30 % of sulphur in Tarnobrzeg area. Considerable parts of deposits are created by calcite and native sulphur. Gypstone, baryte and stroncianite have only minera-logic occurencies. The extensive native sulphur <b>deposits</b> <b>account</b> for 88 % of the country´s sulphur production. There were five sulphur mines in operation: Jeziórko, Grêbów, Machów I, Machów II and Basznia, but operations in Basznia were ended in 1992 and Machów and Machów II were liquidated. The sixth mine Osiek is currently producing. Only the Machów I mine operated an open-pit extraction and refining process, the other four mines producing sulphur using a modified Frasch method that gives elemental sulphur of up to 99, 9 % purity. Sulphur is an important export commodity with foreign sales totalling around 1. 5 - 2. 5 Mt/y.
