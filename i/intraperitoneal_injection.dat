5|$|Paracetamol ester prodrug with L-pyroglutamic acid (PCA), a biosynthetic {{precursor}} of glutathione, has been synthesized to reduce paracetamol hepatotoxicity and improve bioavailability. The toxicological studies of different paracetamol esters show that L-5-oxo-pyrrolidine-2-paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of {{an overdose of}} paracetamol to mice. The liver glutathione values in mice induced by <b>intraperitoneal</b> <b>injection</b> of the ester are superimposable with the GSH levels recorded in untreated mice control group. The mice group treated with an equivalent dose of paracetamol showed a significative decrease of glutathione of 35% (p<0.01 vs untreated control group). The oral LD50 {{was found to be}} greater than 2000 mg kg-1, whereas the intraperitoneal LD50 was 1900 mg kg-1. These results taken together with the good hydrolysis and bioavailability data show that this ester is a potential candidate as a prodrug of paracetamol.|$|E
25|$|Venlafaxine {{indirectly}} affects opioid receptors (mu-, kappa1- kappa3- and delta-opioid receptor subtypes) {{as well as}} the alpha2-adrenergic receptor, and {{was shown}} to increase pain threshold in mice. When mice were tested with a hotplate analgesia meter (to measure pain), both venlafaxine and mirtazapine induced a dose-dependent, naloxone-reversible antinociceptive effect following <b>intraperitoneal</b> <b>injection.</b> These findings suggest venlafaxine's seemingly superior efficacy in severe depression as opioids become increasingly used as a measure of last resort for refractory cases.|$|E
25|$|Pathological changes {{associated}} with CYN poisoning {{were reported to}} be in four distinct stages: inhibition of protein synthesis, proliferation of membranes, lipid accumulation within cells, and finally cell death. Examination of mice livers removed at autopsy showed that on <b>intraperitoneal</b> <b>injection</b> of CYN, after 16 hours ribosomes from the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) had detached, and at 24 hours, marked proliferation of the membrane systems of the smooth ER and Golgi apparatus had occurred. At 48 hours, small lipid droplets had accumulated in the cell bodies, and at 100 hours, hepatocytes in the hepatic lobules were destroyed beyond function.|$|E

30|$|Multiple {{preclinical}} safety {{studies in}} various animal {{models have been}} conducted to assess the immunogenicity, biocompatibility, and tissue response to Seprafilm [4]. Dermal and systemic immunogenicity (using sodium hyaluronate–carboxymethylcellulose (HA-CMC) extracts) were studied with two series of intradermal injections in 15 adult albino guinea pigs, and by six <b>intraperitoneal</b> <b>injections</b> in ten adult guinea pigs {{over a period of}} 2  weeks followed by an intravenous challenge injection, respectively [4]. Dermal injection sites were observed for erythema and edema over a 96 -h period; no indications of dermal sensitization were observed. In addition, no systemic response suggestive of antigenecity or anaphylaxis was observed after multiple <b>intraperitoneal</b> <b>injections</b> followed by an intravenous challenge injection.|$|R

500|$|The [...] in mice {{administered}} cicutoxin by <b>intraperitoneal</b> <b>injection</b> is 48.3mg per kg {{body weight}} (mg/kg); this compares with 5.9mg/kg for mice given potassium cyanide by <b>intraperitoneal</b> <b>injection,</b> while the LD50 for arsenic via <b>intraperitoneal</b> <b>injection</b> in mice is 46.2mg/kg. The exact toxic dose of plant material in humans is unknown; {{it is thought}} ingestion of water hemlock in any quantity can result in poisoning and very small amounts may lead to death. Poisoning has been reported following children blowing whistles made from the hollow stem of water hemlock plants. Intoxication has also been reported following skin contact with the plant; a case was reported where a family of five people rubbed the plant onto the skin and were poisoned, with two children dying. Livestock have long been the worst affected, leading to the common name [...] "cowbane". Poisoning in livestock is common and typically occurs following ingestion of roots of the plant. In the spring when the ground is soft, grazing animals tend to pull the entire plant {{out of the ground}} ingesting both the foiliage and the roots. Roots exposed by ploughing can also be the source of livestock poisonings. Ingestion of plant material may cause death in the animal in as little as 15 minutes.|$|E
500|$|The {{occupancy}} of dopamine transporter (DAT) sites by bupropion and its metabolites in {{the human}} brain as measured by positron emission tomography was 26% according to GlaxoSmithKline researchers and 14% in an independent study. However, despite this reported weak DAT occupancy, a subsequent study looked at the actual extracellular concentrations of dopamine {{in the human}} brain after an acute oral treatment of bupropion and failed to observe any increase, concluding that the weak DAT occupancy was not sufficient to increase dopamine levels. In contrast, the same study also looked at dopamine levels in the rat brain after administration of bupropion via <b>intraperitoneal</b> <b>injection</b> and did see an increase, {{which could have been}} related to species differences. An alternative explanation is that the difference {{had to do with the}} different routes of administration employed (i.e., oral vs. i.p.) and the associated differences in pharmacokinetics and metabolism, namely, the bypassing of first-past metabolism with the latter route, that resulted. Although oral bupropion at clinical doses does not appear to have a significant potential for abuse, there are many isolated case reports of bupropion abuse and [...] "cocaine-like" [...] effects in humans who ingested the drug via a non-oral route (e.g., injection, insufflation, etc.). Notably, awareness of the abuse potential of bupropion via non-conventional routes appears to be especially prominent in correctional facilities.|$|E
2500|$|Honokiol is most {{commonly}} taken orally. There {{are a number}} of supplements available containing honokiol. Magnolia tea made from the bark of the tree is also a common delivery method of honokiol. Both Native Americans and Japanese medicine use tea gargles to treat toothaches and sore throats. Because honokiol is highly hydrophobic it must be dissolved in a lipid for many delivery methods. In many current animal studies the compound is [...] dissolved in a lipid emollient and delivered through <b>intraperitoneal</b> <b>injection.</b> There is ongoing work developing liposomal emulsions for IV delivery.|$|E

2500|$|An initial {{estimate}} of the toxicity of CYN in 1985 was that an [...] at 24 hours was 64±5nbsp&mg of freeze-dried culture/kg of mouse body weight on <b>intraperitoneal</b> <b>injection.</b> A further experiment in 1997 measured the LD50 as 52nbsp&mg/kg at 24 hours and 32nbsp&mg/kg at 7 days, however the data suggested that another toxic compound was present in the isolate of sonicated cells used; predictions made by Ohtani et al. about the 24‑hour toxicity were considerably higher, and it was proposed that another metabolite was present {{to account for the}} relatively low 24‑hour toxicity level measured.|$|E

5000|$|Another study, {{from the}} Department of Ophthalmology at Johns Hopkins University, in Baltimore, Maryland, saw similar effects in two {{components}} of bile, bilirubin and TUDCA, {{in relation to}} RP. Oxidative stress and prolonged light exposure were studied in rd10 mice and albino mice. In rd10 mice, <b>intraperitoneal</b> <b>injections</b> of bilirubin or TUDCA were given every 3 days starting at P6. This caused a considerable preservation in cone cell amount and function at P50, and a modest rod cell amount at P30. In the albino mice models, <b>intraperitoneal</b> <b>injections</b> of bilirubin or TUDCA were given prior to prolonged light exposure.

The performance of the rats in the social interaction test was measured to determine if changes in social interaction induced by beta CCM were mediated {{in part by the}} nucleus raphé dorsalis (NRD). <b>Intraperitoneal</b> <b>injections</b> of beta CCM, 2 and 4 mg kg- 1, reduced social interaction. Intracerebral microinjections of beta CCM (10 - 0. 1 ng in 0. 5 microliter) into the NRD reduced social interaction. Injections outside the NRD did not have this effect. Intracerebral microinjections of RO 15 - 1788 (1 ng in 0. 5 microliters) into the NRD had no effect when given alone, but blocked the reduction in social interaction caused by intracerebral or <b>intraperitoneal</b> <b>injections</b> of beta CCM. No effect was observed when R 15 - 1788 was microinjected into sites outside the NRD. Changes in social interaction may reflect changes in anxiety.
