A quantitative testing method developed by Caplan & Knutson involves the measurement of tracer gas leakage out of a hood.

Operation of the hoods was assessed based on quantitative (with SF 6 as tracer gas) and qualitative (<b>face</b> <b>velocity</b> measurement, using thermal anemometer) tests, according to ASHRAE 110 stndard. Results: In comparison with the minimum acceptable <b>face</b> <b>velocity</b> (80 fpm), the mean values of face velocities of only 9. 09 % of the hoods passed the test (P= 0. 001) and were at an acceptable level.

40|$|A {{collocated}} finite-volume pressure correction {{procedure for}} {{the solution of}} inviscid compressible flow at all speeds is presented. Pressure correction methods usually adopt a so-called Rhie-Chow interpolation for the cell <b>face</b> <b>velocities</b> {{in order to provide}} pressure-velocity coupling. However, as is shown on the testcase of a one-dimensional transonic nozzle, this Rhie-Chow interpolation becomes highly diffusive in high Mach number flows, resulting in an extreme smearing of the shock. Therefore we replace the Rhie-Chow interpolation for velocity and the central interpolation for pressure by AUSM+ definitions. This results in a much sharper shock capturing, even with a first order scheme. However, the diffusive contributions of this flux scale badly when the Mach number diminishes. Furthermore, pressure-velocity coupling at low Mach numbers has to be provided. These two problems can be resolved by respectively introducing a preconditioned speed of sound and adding a pressure-diffusion component. The latter resembles the artificial dissipation introduced by the Rhie-Chow interpolation, but differently it is turned off when sonic values are reached...|$|R

40|$|A `user {{tracer gas}} test` was {{performed}} on laboratory hoods, with a human subject {{standing in front of}} the hood, to assess hood containment ability. The relationship of <b>face</b> <b>velocity</b> and cross draft variables to hood containment ability is investigated. The ability of these variables and other tests, such as smoke challenges or tracer gas tests performed with a manikin at the hood, to predict the results of the user tracer gas test is evaluated. All of the laboratory hoods tested in this study were identical bench top bypass hoods with horizontally sliding sashes. A <b>face</b> <b>velocity</b> traverse, cross draft measurements, a pitot traverse to measure exhaust flow, a smoke test, a manikin tracer gas test, and a user tracer gas test were performed on each hood in several different sash positions. Based on the data collected, <b>face</b> <b>velocity,</b> its distribution and variability, and the magnitude of cross drafts relative to <b>face</b> <b>velocity</b> are important variables in determining hood leakage. `Unblocked` vortices, formed such that no physical barrier exists between the vortex and room air or a person in front of the hood, are identified as important sites of leakage. For the hoods evaluated in this study, unblocked vortices were observed along the beveled side edges. The data support the hypothesis that in the presence of a person {{standing in front of the}} hood, leakage is more likely to occur if unblocked vortices are formed than if all vortices are blocked. Evidence suggests that cross drafts are more likely to cause leakage when flowing in a direction that may cause separated flow along a beveled edge of the hood and thereby augment the unblocked vortices along the edge. Results indicate that smoke tests, manikin tracer gas tests, and average <b>face</b> <b>velocity</b> all serve as useful monitoring techniques. <b>Face</b> <b>velocity</b> measurements and smoke tests, which are easy and inexpensive, may provide information which is as valuable as traditional manikin tracer gas tests...|$|E

We also demonstrated two low-pressure- drop configurations of the sorbent, namely, a particulate form and a monolithic form. We showed that the particulate form of the sorbent would take up 100 % of the mercury {{so long as the}} residence time in a bed of the sorbent exceeded 0. 1 seconds. In principle, the particulate form of the sorbent could be imbedded in the back side of a higher temperature bag filter in a full-scale application. With typical bag <b>face</b> <b>velocities</b> of four feet per minute, the thickness of the particulate layer would need to be about 2000 microns to accomplish the uptake of the mercury. For heat transfer efficiency, however, we believed the monolithic form of the sorbent would be the more practical in a full scale application.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to quantitatively evaluate hood leakage by measuring <b>face</b> <b>velocity</b> and turbulence during a volume generating process designed to simulate a hot process, defined here as any operation producing high temperature gases. A hot process has been recognized as a causal factor in the leakage of contaminants from laboratory fume hoods since 1950. A literature search reveals that during the last couple of decades only Johnson et al. reported a quantitative linear relationship between thermal loading and breathing zone trace gas concentrations using the ASHRAE 110 - 1995 method. Hot processes may well be the most common and least recognized of the operational factors able to cause fume hoods to leak. For hood performance testing, I conducted smoke tests and <b>face</b> <b>velocity</b> tests. Smoke tests were executed by means of smoke tubes and smoke matches as screening tools for hood leakage. <b>Face</b> <b>velocity</b> tests were conducted at 16 points arranged to represent equal areas of the hood face when the sash was fully opened. <b>Face</b> <b>velocity</b> data were indexed in time and space and used to estimate turbulence. By assuming corresponding samples were collected simultaneously, turbulence parameters were computed as both spatial and temporal averages of the velocity pressure. Turbulence is represented by the ratio of the standard deviation to average <b>face</b> <b>velocity</b> at each measurement point. Turbulence is generated by pressure differences occurring between the velocity pressure at the hood face and the volume generating rate that simulates a hot process. Through the average <b>face</b> <b>velocity</b> and turbulence measurements, I found that at a fixed exhaust flow, with a fixed injection volume flow, turbulence is stronger in the open sash position than in the reduced sash position. Further, turbulence associated with a volume generating process is more evident in the space-based data than in the time-based data. <b>Face</b> <b>velocity</b> at each point tends to decrease in a hood when the flow injected by a volume generating process increases. These data suggest that when a hood is operated with a volume generating process, leakage can be minimized by reducing the sash opening, by not positioning any object within six inches of the hood face, and by keeping face velocities stable...|$|E

The implication is that the models may be used as reliable input to panel-level simulations for predicting such metrics as the reaction forces and the displacements. Discrepancies arise for strong cores with relatively large push back stress, and for systems with very thin wet faces, suggesting that embellishments are required for panels incorporating such features...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{momentum}} weighted interpolation is used {{to determine}} analytical expressions for the cell <b>face</b> <b>velocities</b> which are employed in the multiphase continuity equation in a collocated variable arrangement. A special approach is adopted for the momentum weighted interpolation to handle large source terms, volume fractions, and gradients of these. The resulting linearized equations are solved in a fully coupled manner. The fully coupled method is validated with the lid driven cavity data of Ghia (1982), and demonstrated on two practical multiphase cases. Firstly, the method is demonstrated simulating volume of fluid (VOF) computations of a gas-liquid flow case. Secondly, the method is demonstrated on solving the continuous part of an Euler-Lagrange gas-solid flow problem. The difficulties {{in the first case}} are large source terms and gradients of density, and in the second case the presence of volume fraction and gradients hereof, as well as source terms. The results are in accordance with results from the staggered segregated approach. Moreover, due to the collocated variable arrangement, complex geometries can be easily handeled. Both robustness and computational efficiency of this fully coupled approach are shown...|$|R
