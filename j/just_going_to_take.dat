He developed a pilot training program, taught the Program’s first advanced course, and earned his nickname, “Chief”. In March 1941, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was touring the Institute’s hospital. Knowing of the flight program, she asked to meet its chief instructor. The First Lady told Anderson she had always heard that “colored people couldn’t fly,” but it appeared that he could. “I’m <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have a <b>take</b> flight with you,” she said. Anderson was not about to turn down the First Lady, despite the protests of her security detail. Upon returning 40 minutes later, Anderson’s delighted passenger exclaimed, “Well I see you can fly, all right!” No doubt her experience was a boost to President Roosevelt’s administration, which had just established the Tuskegee Airmen Experiment, to explore if it was possible to train black pilots for military service. Anderson went on to train other famous Military Aviation Pioneers such as General Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. and General Daniel [...] "Chappie" [...] James, Sr.|$|R

5000|$|... 2009: Judgment July 28, 2009 - $5.5 Million Jury Verdict {{largest in}} Skagit County History. Woman {{was injured in}} {{collision}} with drunk driver, Whatcom County and Washington State Patrol found negligent Whatcom County and the Washington State Patrol must pay $5.5 million after a jury's verdict Tuesday, April 28, 2009 determined that their negligence allowed a drunk driver to injure a local woman. The Whatcom County woman, Hailey French, sued the driver, Janine Parker, Whatcom County and the Washington State Patrol in Skagit County Superior Court. After a three-week trial {{and more than a}} day of deliberations, the jury ruled in favor of French. The county will have to pay about $2.8 million, the state about $2.6 million and Parker $25,000, said one of French's attorneys, Dean Brett. The jury found that Parker was more at fault for the crash than the county and state, but she doesn't have insurance to pay for the amount awarded, Brett said. French's other attorney, Gene Moses, said it was the largest amount awarded by a jury in Skagit County's history. French was seriously injured after Parker's car crossed the center line on Mount Baker Highway and collided with her car early January 4, 2007. French spent 45 days in Harborview Medical Center in Seattle after the crash and has undergone numerous surgeries {{as a result of her}} injuries. Brett said the money would pay for her medical bills and any additional surgeries she may need. [...] "She was relieved that she is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have her medical bills paid for for the rest of her life," [...] Brett said. [...] "She's <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of her body. She's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try to live as normal of a life as she can." [...] The jury found that Whatcom County and the State Patrol were negligent in not preventing Parker from driving drunk before the crash. Parker admitted her negligence before the trial began. Parker was found passed out behind the wheel at the intersection of Sunset Drive and Barkley Boulevard hours before the crash. Washington State Patrol Trooper Chad Dwayne Bosman, Badge # 349, arrested and cited Parker for DUI in case C0670915 but did not impound her car, release her to a sober person or book her into the Whatcom County Jail. Rather, Bosman drove Parker 9 miles to her home on Lake Whatcom, gave her back her keys and told her not to drive until she sobered up. After the trooper left, Parker called a cab to go back to her car. She began driving east on Mount Baker Highway before turning around and colliding with French. French's lawsuit alleged the county was negligent because it was supervising Parker while she was on deferred prosecution for a prior DUI arrest. Parker was supposed to be driving with an ignition interlock device but never had one installed in her car. The jury found the county was negligent for failing to check to see if the device was installed., ...|$|R

6000|$|By-and-by, {{feeling very}} tired, {{he sat down}} to rest, and just where he sat grew a plant with long white flowers like tall thin goblets in shape. Sitting on the grass he could see right {{into one of the}} flower-tubes, and {{presently}} he noticed a little, old, grey, shrivelled woman in it, very, very small, for she was not longer than the nail of his little finger. She wore a grey shawl that dragged behind her, and kept getting under her feet and tripping her up. She was most active, whisking about this way and that inside the flower; and at intervals she turned to stare at Martin, who kept getting nearer and nearer to watch her until his face nearly touched the flower; and whenever she looked at him she wore an exceedingly severe expression on her small dried-up countenance. It seemed to Martin that she was very angry with him for some reason. Then she would turn her back on him, and tumble about in the tube of the flower, and gathering up the ends of her shawl in her arms begin dusting with great energy; then hurrying out once more she would shake the dust from her big, funny shawl in his eyes.

She looked at him, though she {{did not seem to be}} looking at him, and told herself that the man was nothing to her. He had caused her unutterable sorrow, with which her heart was still sore;--but he was nothing to her.

By the assistance of this eddy, I was carried above a league home again, when being in the wake of the island, betwixt the two currents, I found the water to be in a sort of a stand. About four o'clock in the afternoon, I reached within a league of the island, and perceived the points of the rock, which caused this disaster, stretching out, as I observed before, to the southward, which throwing off the current more southwardly had occasioned another eddy to the north. But having a fair brisk gale, I stretched across this eddy, and in an hour came within a mile of the shore, where I soon landed to my unspeakable comfort; and after an humble prostration, thanking God for my deliverance, with a resolution to lay all thoughts of escaping aside, I brought my boat safe to a little cove, and laid me down to take a welcome repose. When I awoke I was considering how I might get my boat home; and coasting along the shore, I came to a good bay, which ran up to a rivulet or brook, where finding a safe harbour, I stowed her as safe as if she had been in a dry-dock made on purpose for her.|$|E
