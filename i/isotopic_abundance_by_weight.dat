In most cases unassigned shifts could not be used to determine the structures. This method requires no prior knowledge of the crystal structure, and was used to determine the correct crystal structure to within an atomic rmsd of less than 0. 12 Å with respect to the known reference structure.

The 36 molecular species thus far identified in interstellar space are listed in several groups which include simple hydrides, oxides, and sulfides, various derivatives of ammonia, molecules involving linear carbon chains, cyanides, and molecules related in structure to formaldehyde, alcohols, or ethers. Several free radicals are described, {{the discovery}} of molecules in external galaxies is discussed, and possible mechanisms for molecular formation are noted. Methods for examining relative <b>isotopic</b> <b>abundances</b> <b>by</b> measuring molecules in interstellar clouds are outlined, mechanisms for the excitation of interstellar molecules are reviewed, and values are presented for the C- 12 /C- 13 abundance ratio {{in a number of}} interstellar clouds.

For flutamide and flufenamic acid we find that assigned 1 H isotropic chemical shifts provide sufficient discrimination so as to determine the correct structures from a set of predicted structures using the root-mean-square deviation between experimentally determined and calculated chemical shifts. In both cases neither unassigned 1 H shifts nor 13 C shifts could be {{used to determine the}} structures. The correct structures were determined to within an atomic rmsd of less than 0. 12 Å with respect to the known structures. For theophylline the NMR spectrum is too simple to allow unambiguous structure selection. We show how the information contained in the NMR chemical shifts is complementary (orthogonal) to PXR D. Combining 1 H NMR chemical shift, CSP/DFT and PXRD leads to a very robust structure determination protocol, with no hypothesis, and no bias. We also use this procedure to determine {{for the first time the}} crystal structure of a pharmaceutically pertinent molecule with previously unknown structure, where previous attempts by X-ray diffraction alone had not been successful. Combining 1 H solid-state NMR spectroscopy with first-principles calculations can also be applied to the crystal structure determination of metal organic frameworks. We demonstrate this by reporting the discovery of the previously unknown crystal structure of a novel porous imidazolate substituted metal organic framework with possible applications as a H 2 storage material. 1 H NMR experiments provided a description of the proton environments within the MOF, which in combination with DFT chemical shift calculations and PXRD led to the elucidation of the complete crystal structure...|$|R

We also make ruggedized neutron and gamma ray detector packages {{that can be used to}} make reliable measurements on the drill collar of a rotating drill string while the well is being drilled, where the conditions are severe.

40|$|Abstract: The 32 -residue {{leucine zipper}} subsequence, called here Jun-lz, {{associates}} in benign media {{to form a}} parallel two-stranded coiled coil. Studies are reported of its thermal unfolding/folding transition by circular dichroism (CD) on samples of natural <b>isotopic</b> <b>abundance</b> and <b>by</b> both equilibrium and spin inversion transfer (SIT) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) on samples labeled at the leucine- 18 a-carbon with 99 % 13 C. The data cover {{a wide range of}} temperature and concentration, and show that Jun-lz unfolds below room temperature, being far less stable than some other leucine zippers such as GCN 4. 13 C-NMR shows two well-separated resonances. We ascribe the upfield one to 13 C spins on unfolded single chains and the downfield one to 13 C spins on coiled-coil dimers. Their relative intensities provide a measure of the unfolding equilibrium constant. In SIT NMR, the recovery of the equilibrium magnetization after one resonance is inverted is modulated in part by the unfolding and folding rate constants, which are accessible from the data. Global Bayesian analysis of the equilibrium and SIT NMR data provide values for the standard enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity of unfolding, and show the latter to be unusually large. The CD results are compatible with the NMR findings. Global Bayesian analysis of the SIT NMR data yields the corresponding activation parameters for unfolding and folding.

They were rather abundantly observed near the shore, probably along current-rips, as shown in Figs. 1 - 4. 4) From the results of the present surveys and the current investigations by the drift bottle method which were previously made by the Fukuoka and the Nagasaki Prefectural Fisheries Experimental Stations, there is considerable evidence, as mentioned in the first part of this paper, that the floating seaweeds in this area are not of origin of southern or western Kyushu area. 第 1 報においては津屋崎近海の流れ藻を対象とし, 主として種類相や各種類の重量組成の周年変化について明らかにした(瀬川・沢田・檜垣・吉田 1959). すでに述べたように,沖合,とくに対馬暖流の主流に当ると思われる対馬方面の調査も沿岸のものと同様に必要であり,筆者らがこの研究に着手した時から流れ藻の資源的意義,起源などに関する解決をめざして沖合の調査を計画していた. 壱岐・対馬方面での調査としては, 1957 年 7 月から 9 月にかけて計 4 回の機会を得たが,その結果少なくともその当時の夏から秋のはじめ頃は予想に反して非常に流れ藻の量が少なかつたこと,および種類組成は同時期に津屋崎近海でみられるものと大差なかつたことなどがわかつたので報告する. なお従来海流調査のため各地で海流びんが投入されているので,流れ藻の移動と類似の関係にあると思われるこれらの結果について若干の考察を行いたい. この調査は福岡県水産試験場の玄海丸,および佐賀県水産試験場の舞鶴丸で行つている月次定期海洋観測に便乗して行つたものである. 便乗の便宜をいただいた両試験場長ならびに調査に協力いただいた乗組員の方々に謝意を表する...|$|R

40|$|Carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and the nonradiogenic and radiogenic {{noble gases}} are tracked from {{primordial}} inventories to their present {{states in a}} revised model of atmospheric evolution on Mars. Elemental and <b>isotopic</b> <b>abundances</b> evolve <b>by</b> hydrodynamic escape, impact erosion, outgassing, sputtering, photochemical escape of nitrogen, and carbonate formation and recycling. Atmospheric history is divided into early and late evolutionary periods, the first characterized by high CO 2 pressures and a possible greenhouse and the second by a low pressure cap-regolith buffered system initiated by polar CO 2 condensation approximately 3. 7 Gyr ago. During early evolution the Xe isotopes are fractionated to their present composition by hydraulic escape, and CO 2 pressure and isotopic history are dictated by the interplay of losses to erosion, sputtering, and carbonate precipitation, additions by outgassing and carbonate recycling, and perhaps also by feedback stabilization under greenhouse conditions. Atmospheric collapse near 3. 7 Gyr leads to abrupt increases in the mixing ratios of preexisting Ar, Ne, and N 2 at the exobase and their rapid removal <b>by</b> sputtering.

40|$|Determining the {{importance}} of prey taxa in the diets of predacious species is a frequent objective in fisheries research. Various indices of prey importance are in common use, and all give different results because of their emphasis on different aspects of fish diets. We explored these differences by empirically comparing four well-known indices—percent weight (%W), percent occurrence (%O), percent number (%N), and percent index of relative importance (%IRI) — {{as well as a}} modified %IRI (%MIRI), as applied to an extensive data set on the diets of six fish species in Spirit Lake, Iowa. Correlations among all indices were positive but were weaker among component indices (%W, %O, and %N) than between the two compound indices (%IRI and %MIRI); correlations among component indices were also weaker than correlations of compound with component indices. Correlation strength of %MIRI with the three component indices varied greatly (%N, %O, %W), whereas the correlation strength of %IRI with component indices was similar. Importance values based on %W, %MIRI, and %N depend more on prey size than those based on %IRI and %O. The %W and %MIRI emphasized {{the importance}} of large prey taxa, whereas %N emphasized small prey in diets; %IRI and %O were similarly unbiased with respect to prey size. The %O yielded substantially higher importance values than all other indices. Thus, for use as a general index of dietary importance, we believe %IRI provides the optimal balancing of frequency of occurrence, numerical <b>abundance,</b> and <b>abundance</b> <b>by</b> <b>weight</b> of taxa in fish diets...|$|R
