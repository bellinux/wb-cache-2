40|$|Marine sediments {{act as the}} {{ultimate}} sink for organic carbon, sequestering otherwise rapidly cycling carbon for geologic timescales. Sedimentary organic carbon burial appears {{to be controlled by}} oxygen exposure time in situ, and much research has focused on understanding the mechanisms of preservation of organic carbon. In this context, combustion-derived black carbon has received attention as a form of refractory organic carbon that may be preferentially preserved in soils and sediments. However, little is understood about the environmental roles, transport and distribution of black carbon. Here we apply isotopic analyses to <b>graphitic</b> <b>black</b> carbon samples isolated from pre-industrial marine and terrestrial sediments. We find that this material is terrestrially derived and almost entirely depleted of radiocarbon, suggesting that it is graphite weathered from rocks, rather than a combustion product. The widespread presence of fossil <b>graphitic</b> <b>black</b> carbon in sediments has therefore probably led to significant overestimates of burial of combustion-derived black carbon in marine sediments. It could be responsible for biasing radiocarbon dating of sedimentary organic carbon, and also reveals a closed loop in the carbon cycle. Depending on its susceptibility to oxidation, this recycled carbon may be locked away from the biologically mediated carbon cycle for many geologic cycles...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTwenty {{percent of}} the uranium {{produced}} in France was extracted in the Armorican Massif, in three different locations (Pontivy, Guérande et Mortagne) which belong to the "High Heat Production Belt", a 100 km wide NW-SE zone characterized by elevated contents in radioactive elements present {{in most of the}} geological formations [1], including 320 to 315 Ma old peraluminous granites [2]. In the Guérande uranium district, the Pen Ar Ran deposit is located in a deformed zone, at the contact between porphyroids and quartzitic <b>black</b> <b>schists.</b> This deformed zone corresponds to an E-W shear zone that affected both the metamorphic formations (porphyroids and <b>black</b> <b>schists)</b> and the intrusive Guérande leucogranite, during its emplacement. Mineralization is under the form of massive veins carrying pechblende and sulphide that are spatially associated with the leucogranite. However, this uranium deposit is different from the other "vein type" known in France because of the unusual nature of its uranium oxides (between pechblende and uraninite). Furthermore, the fluids responsible for this mineralization are hotter (350 - 400 °C) than elsewhere. The question of the source of the uranium is also complex. The uranium content of the metamorphic formations is rather low (around 3 ppm) but it is also low in the leucogranite (max. 9 ppm). It is however possible that the uranium was leached out of the granite by surface derived oxidizing fluids while the granite was still at depth [3]. Therefore, the leucogranite could represent the source of the uranium. In order to test this hypothetis, we performed a comprehensive petrological, geochemical, and geochronological study of the Guérande granite and compared these data to the available data from the porphyroid and the uranium mineralization.

Especially the water supply needs to be secured, {{both in terms of}} quantity and quality. In Morocco, numerous urban mine sites were abandoned regardless rehabilitation strategy. Consequently, mining activity contributes massively to deteriorate air, soil and water quality, to degrade natural ecosystems and to menace public health. The abandoned coalmine of Jerada is located in north east of Morocco,in horst zone, in the productive geological formation of Westphalian C. The mining activity has generated along 65 years (1936 - 2001), 15 to 20 millions tons of washery waste rocks, cumulated principally in urban center. The groundwater (n= 30) and waste rock (n= 7) sampling was led in the middle of May 2008, which presents in local climatic context the end of rainy season and the beginning of sec season. Waste rocks are exhaustively <b>black</b> <b>schist,</b> with a paucity in pyrite (anthracite debris contain between 2 to 5 % of synergic pyrite) and predominance of calcareous minerals essentially as dolomite. Consequently, the majority of waste rock samples are not acid generators. The pyrite oxidation produces sulphuric acid, which will be quickly neutralized by carbonates. The alkaline tendency of pH classifies Jerada abandoned coal mine in circum neutral mining drainage type (NMD). The leaching through unsaturated and saturated zone will be facilitated due to a big pore size and a breakingtectonic having fractured Jerada coal basin. The deformed <b>black</b> <b>schist</b> alternative to sandstone permits a good water circulation. The massive product of mining drainage and the major pollutant of groundwater is undoubtedly S-SO 4 (27 / 30 exceed WHO guideline). The spatial correlation between S-total and salinity illustrates the deterioration of groundwater quality due to pyrite oxidation. The alteration of schist and halite dissolution contribute to enrich groundwater in chloride (26 / 30 exceed WHO guideline). The quasi-absence of sewage disposal contaminates groundwater in N-NO 3 (18 / 30 exceed WHO threshold). Metallic pollution of groundwater is geographically very restrained (1 / 30 to 3 / 30 exceed slightly WHO guidelines), due to the precipitation of metallic elements under hydroxide form.
