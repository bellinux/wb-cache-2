60|$|<b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> {{considered}} how <b>he</b> {{would address}} her; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> thought what <b>he</b> would say. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> only {{felt that it}} was wretchedness to him to quarrel with her, {{and that it would be}} happiness to be allowed to love her. And yet he could not lower himself by asking her pardon. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> done her no wrong. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> calumniated her, not injured her, as she had accused him of doing. He could not confess sins of which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been guilty. <b>He</b> could only let the past be past and ask her as to her and his hopes for the future.|$|R
60|$|No more! <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> approved, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> blamed. <b>He</b> would {{interfere}} no more in her fate. She seated herself, {{and drew}} down her black veil, a chill creeping over her.|$|R

5|$|On January 10, 2007, Ripken {{expressed}} interest in purchasing the Baltimore Orioles if current owner Peter Angelos were to sell the team. He {{had yet to be}} approached about the potential purchase of the team.

60|$|Cosimo {{at least}} had ceased to smile. His {{handsome}} white face had {{lost some of its}} supercilious confidence. Here was something unexpected, something upon which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> reckoned, against which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> provided.|$|R
60|$|But <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> {{condemned}} her. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> condemned her altogether, neither <b>had</b> <b>he</b> acquitted her.

Leonardo DiCaprio is also referenced in the scene.|$|E
5|$|Although Dawkins {{invented the}} term meme, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> {{claimed that the}} idea was entirely novel, {{and there have been}} other {{expressions}} for similar ideas in the past. For instance, John Laurent has suggested that the term may have derived from the work of the little-known German biologist Richard Semon. In 1904, Semon published Die Mneme (which appeared in English in 1924 as The Mneme). This book discusses the cultural transmission of experiences, with insights parallel to those of Dawkins. Laurent also found the term mneme used in Maurice Maeterlinck's The Life of the White Ant (1926), and has highlighted the similarities to Dawkins's concept.|$|E
5|$|As {{the taping}} time, 6 pm, is fast approaching, Tracy begins acting strangely. Liz and Pete {{discover}} that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been taking his medication correctly. Liz calls Tracy's doctor, Dr. Leo Spaceman (Chris Parnell), who gives her instructions regarding the medication. Liz gives the instructions to Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) {{who has to}} visit multiple identical pharmacies until he finds the correct one, which will have Tracy's new medication. Liz and Pete's attempts to get Tracy to the Late Night stage on time are further complicated as Jack persistently calls Liz to his office to ask for her advice on a speech {{he is going to}} read at The Waldorf Astoria. Tracy eventually appears on Late Night only to immediately fall asleep after sitting down.|$|E

60|$|The warden {{hung his}} head, {{and made no}} reply: he could not condescend to say that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> {{intended}} to give his son-in-law the slip; and as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> the courage to avow it, he said nothing.|$|R
60|$|But, he kept {{continually}} recalling, when <b>he</b> <b>had</b> stood {{once more}} {{face to face}} with her and had been shocked at the change in her and had heard the details of her adversity, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> the heart to tell her of the closer interest which had entered his life. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> lied; yet <b>he</b> <b>had</b> kept silence.|$|R

Soon after, Peter returns to find the dance almost abandoned except for Mary Jane, who is dancing with another boy. Downtrodden, he is reassured when Mary Jane walks up to him and tells him that she saved the last dance for him.|$|E

As Ashley rubs lotion on Erik's thigh, he {{develops}} an involuntary erection and accidentally ejaculates over her possessions. Erik apologizes and explains to Ashley that, after breaking up with Tracy, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> ejaculated in four months, masturbation being a taboo in his house because of a previous incident. Meanwhile, Cooze {{falls in love with}} Ashley's roommate Denise; however, she is nervous about showing her genitalia and having sex with him, so she gives Cooze a handjob instead. After talking with Erik, Bobby, and Dwight about Denise, Cooze develops suspicions that Denise might have a penis, so Dwight encourages him to find out.|$|E

When Foyt made his first Indianapolis 500 race in 2003, he became the {{youngest}} driver to start in the event. He continued in IndyCar for two more years until his back was injured at the 2005 Indianapolis 500. Later that season he made several NASCAR Busch Series starts.

60|$|There {{was not a}} {{fence in}} the whole {{countryside}} that March <b>had</b> <b>not</b> bolted over at full gallop, or ridden crash through {{if he could not}} go over it. There was not a tree within a circuit of four miles from the top of which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> fallen. There was not a pond or pool in the neighbourhood into which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> soused at some period of his stormy juvenile career, and there was not a big boy whom <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> fought and thrashed--or been thrashed by--scores of times.|$|R

50|$|The second voyage was {{therefore}} a failure as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> discovered any new areas and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> received {{much of a}} share of the plunder obtained by Vergara and Camps.
