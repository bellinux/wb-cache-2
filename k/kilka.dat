40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{intestinal}} helminth parasite fauna of 398 specimens of three species of <b>kilkas,</b> C. engrauliformis (N= 92), C. grimmi (N= 136) and C. cultriventris (N= 170) from Babolsar harbor were investigated. Five parasite species were found including: Corynosoma strumosum (Acanthocephala), Pronoprymna ventricosa (Trematoda), Contracaecum sp. (Nematoda), Raphidascaris sp. (Nematoda) and Anisakis sp. (Nematoda). The highest prevalence and abundance {{were observed in}} C. strumosum and P. ventricosa. The prevalence and abundance of C. strumosum in C. grimmi {{was significantly higher than}} C. engrauliformis. The prevalence and abundance of P. ventricosa in C. cultriventris was significantly higher than C. engrauliformis. The prevalence, mean intensity and mean abundance of the parasites were compared according to the sex, length group and season also effect of parasite on host growth parameters was considered. The diversity, equability, similarity, species richness, dominance Indices and specificity indices of helminth parasites of the three host species were studied. Also the lead and cadmium concentrations in the intestine, muscle, liver, kidney and gonad of <b>kilkas</b> and their parasites C. strumosum and P. ventricosa were measured and compared. The results revealed that lead and cadmium concentrations in C. strumosum and P. ventricosa were significantly higher than kidney, liver, intestine, gonad and muscle.

40|$|Feeding {{habits of}} Caspian marine shad Alosa braschnikowii (Borodin, 1904), inhabiting {{in the western}} part of Caspian Sea such as prey {{spectrum}} and seasonal dynamics have been studied. As in other parts of Caspian Sea, throughout the year, the main hunt of Caspian marine shad constituted <b>kilkas,</b> gobies and shrimps while other groups of zoobenthos were represented in a lesser extent. Importance of other fishes and zoobenthos in the diet of Caspian marine shad is influenced by their ecological morpho-functional peculiarities. Seasonal changes of species composition and proportions of fodder food items are caused by life cycles of fishes and migrations of fodder entities. The changes of food composition depending length of fishes, the depth and haul region are analyzed. Caspian marine shad most intensively feeds in spring (March – April) before spawning and in summer (July) after spawning...|$|R
