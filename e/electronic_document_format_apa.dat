40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the history of the {{standardisation}} of two largely overlapping <b>electronic</b> <b>document</b> <b>formats</b> between 2005 and 2008, and its implications for future IT standards development. Design/methodology/approach - The <b>document</b> <b>format</b> controversy is researched as an exemplary case study of the institutional rivalries, perspectives and strategic interests at play in standardisation processes. The study adopts a methodological lens of discursive institutionalism in order to explain how actors assume and perform a variety of roles during the controversy. It consults a range of documentary sources, including media commentary, corporate press releases and blog posts, financial reports and technical specifications. Findings - The study shows that: first, intentions to increase competition in the office software market through the standardisation of <b>document</b> <b>formats</b> led to a standards "arms race"; second, this further entrenched the position of a single market actor; and third, the resulting public debate nevertheless has reinvigorated the push for genuinely open standards. Social implications - Information technology standards are often touted as mechanisms for increasing the competitiveness of a market, thereby benefitting consumers and the greater public. In the presence of dominant institutional actors, efforts to standardise can, perversely, undermine this benefit. Increased public scrutiny through online media offers a potential remedy. Originality/value - This research presents a novel account of the controversy over the <b>document</b> <b>format</b> standardisation process, understood through the lens of discursive institutionalism. It also shows the increasing and potentially putative role of online media in the development of ITstandards generally...|$|R

This {{technology has}} transformed the content and ideas of the printing press (ink and paper) into bitslbytes of <b>electronic</b> <b>documents.</b> Most importantly, digital technology has become a cornerstone in e-business and Internet marketing by increasing the ability of accessing and distributing information via electronic media. The focal point of this thesis is to design digital brochures for the Material Handling Industry of America (MHIA). PDF document will be used in converting the hard copy brochures into interactive <b>electronic</b> <b>document</b> <b>format.</b> These brochures include "Application Guidelines for Gravity Roller & Wheel Conveyors " and "Retail Trends & Conveyor Systems". Before the conversion, the texts and images will be updated in order to reflect the current changes in the industry and the true picture of the company. Then it will be formatted for on screen reading. Finally, bookmarks and thumbnails will be added to increase the navigability of the PDFdocuments.

25|$|The Greek {{alphabet}} and its successors {{settled on}} a left-to-right pattern, from the top {{to the bottom of}} the page. Other scripts, such as Arabic and Hebrew, came to be written right-to-left. Scripts that incorporate Chinese characters have traditionally been written vertically (top-to-bottom), from the right to the left of the page, but nowadays are frequently written left-to-right, top-to-bottom, due to Western influence, a growing need to accommodate terms in the Latin script, and technical limitations in popular <b>electronic</b> <b>document</b> <b>formats.</b> Chinese characters sometimes, as in signage, especially when signifying something old or traditional, may also be written from right to left. The Old Uyghur alphabet and its descendants are unique in being written top-to-bottom, left-to-right; this direction originated from an ancestral Semitic direction by rotating the page 90° counter-clockwise to conform to the appearance of vertical Chinese writing. Several scripts used in the Philippines and Indonesia, such as Hanunó'o, are traditionally written with lines moving away from the writer, from bottom to top, but are read horizontally left to right. While Ogham is written bottom to top and read vertically, commonly on the corner of a stone.|$|R

40|$|Small {{and medium}} {{enterprises}} (SMEs) {{are becoming increasingly}} engaged in B 2 B interactions. The ubiquitousness of the Internet and the quasi-reliance on <b>electronic</b> <b>document</b> exchanges with larger trading partners have fostered this move. The main technical challenge that this brings to SMEs is that of business document integration: they need to exchange business documents with heterogeneous <b>document</b> <b>formats</b> and also integrate these documents with internal information systems. Often {{they can not afford}} using expensive, customized and proprietary solutions for document exchange and storage. Rather they need cost-effective approaches designed based on open standards and backed with easy-to-use information systems. In this dissertation, we investigate the problem of business document integration for SMEs following a design science methodology. We propose a framework and conceptual architecture for a business document integration system (BDIS). By studying existing business <b>document</b> <b>formats,</b> we recommend using the GS 1 XML standard format as the intermediate <b>format</b> for business <b>documents</b> in BDIS. The GS 1 standards are widely used in supply chains and logistics globally. We present an architecture for BDIS consisting of two layers: one for the design of internal information system based on relational databases, capable of storing XML business documents, and the other enabling the exchange of heterogeneous business documents at runtime. For the design layer, we leverage existing XML schema conversion approaches, and extend them, to propose a customized and novel approach for converting GS 1 XML document schemas into relational schemas. For the runtime layer, we propose wrappers as architectural components for the conversion of various <b>electronic</b> <b>documents</b> <b>formats</b> into the GS 1 XML format. We demonstrate our approach through a case study involving a GS 1 XML business document. We have implemented a prototype BDIS. We have evaluated and compared it with existing research and commercial tools for XML to relational schema conversion. The results show that it generates operational and simpler relational schemas for GS 1 XML documents. In conclusion, the proposed framework enables SMEs to engage effectively in electronic business...|$|R

40|$|For most people, the {{creation}} and editing of mathematical text in <b>electronic</b> <b>documents</b> is a slow, tedious and error-prone activity. For people with disabilities, especially blindness or severe visual impairments, this is far more of a problem. The lack of easy access to good mathematical resources limits the educational and career opportunities for people with such disabilities. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) could enable both able-bodied {{and people who are}} physically disabled gain better access to mathematics. However, whilst ASR has improved over recent years, most speech recognition systems do not support the input and editing of dictated mathematical expressions. In this thesis, we present results of studies of how students and staff at Kingston University, of various levels of mathematical achievement, read-out given expressions in English. Furthermore, we analyse evidence, both from our own studies, and from transcriptions of mathematics classes recorded in the British National Corpus (BNC), that people do consistently place pauses to mark the grouping of subexpressions. The results from this enabled us to create an innovative context-free attribute grammar capable of capturing a high proportion of GCSE-Ievel spoken mathematics, of which can be syntactically incorrect and/or incomplete. This attribute grammar was implemented, tested and evaluated in our prototype system TalkMaths. We also compiled statistics of "common sequences" of mathematics-related keywords from these two sources, with a view to using these to develop a "predictive model" for use in our system. We implemented and evaluated a prototype system TalkMaths, that enables the dictation of mathematical expressions, up to approximately GCSE level, and converts them into various <b>electronic</b> <b>document</b> <b>formats</b> Our evaluations of this system showed that people of various levels of mathematical ability can learn how to produce <b>electronic</b> mathematical <b>documents</b> by speech. These studies have demonstrated that producing mathematical documents by speech is a viable alternative to using the keyboard & mouse, especially for those who rely on speech recognition software to use a computer. A novel editing paradigm, based on a "hybrid grid" is proposed, implemented and tested in a further usability study. Although the evaluation of this editing paradigm is incomplete, it has demonstrated that it is promising and worthy of further research...|$|R
