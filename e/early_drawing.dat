5|$|Helen Beatrix Potter {{was born}} in Kensington, London on 28 July 1866 to wealthy parents, and educated at home {{by a series of}} governesses and tutors. She {{displayed}} artistic talent <b>early,</b> <b>drawing</b> and sketching mammals, insects, reptiles and amphibians, flowers and plants. In the early 1890s, she enjoyed her first professional artistic success when she sold six designs to a greeting card publisher. On 16 December 1901, she privately issued The Tale of Peter Rabbit, and, on 2 October 1902, a trade edition of the tale was released by Frederick Warne & Co. to great success. She published tales similar in content, style, and format for Warnes in the years to follow, and, in 1904, The Tale of Benjamin Bunny, a sequel to Peter Rabbit. In July 1905, Potter bought Hill Top, a working farm in the Lake District with the profits from her books and a small legacy left her by an aunt; the farm became her home away from London and her artistic retreat. In a few years, Potter had established her own career, income, and home.|$|E
25|$|Michelangelo left a few drawings, {{including}} an <b>early</b> <b>drawing</b> of the dome, and some drawings of details. There were also detailed engravings published in 1569 by Stefan du Pérac {{who claimed that}} they were the master's final solution. Michelangelo, like Sangallo before him, also left a large wooden model. Giacomo della Porta subsequently altered this model in several ways, in keeping with changes that he made to the design. Most of these changes were of a cosmetic nature, such as the adding of lion's masks over the swags on the drum in honour of Pope Sixtus and adding a circlet of finials around the spire {{at the top of the}} lantern, as proposed by Sangallo. The major change that was made to the model, either by della Porta, or Michelangelo himself before his death, was to raise the outer dome higher above the inner one.|$|E

500|$|Pearl's {{voice is}} {{provided}} by American actress Lori Alan in the series and both feature films. During her audition for the role, she was shown an <b>early</b> <b>drawing</b> of Pearl with the other main characters. She noted how Pearl was {{much larger than the}} rest of the cast, and decided to reflect the character's size in her voice by making it deep and full in tone. She also aimed to make the voice invoke the sound of whales’ low vocalizations while also sounding [...] "spoiled and lovable". In an interview with AfterBuzz TV, Alan said that she knew Pearl [...] "had to sound somewhat like a child," [...] but at the same time needed [...] "an abnormally large voice".|$|E

When Lawrence {{was on a}} {{sidewalk}} in Los Feliz, Los Angeles with a friend who knew SpongeBob SquarePants casting director Donna Grillo, her friend said to Grillo that Lawrence had [...] "an interesting voice". Grillo invited Lawrence to audition and she got the role. Mrs. Puff's voice is provided by American actress Mary Jo Catlett, {{who is known for}} her live-action roles on television programs from the 1970s such as Diff'rent Strokes and M*A*S*H. As of 2017, voicing Mrs. Puff has become her only remaining regular television role; Catlett described herself as [...] "basically retired" [...] in 2013, since she feels that voicing Mrs. Puff requires less preparation than her performances in person. Lori Alan voices Pearl Krabs.

2500|$|The Caproni's {{fuselage}} {{was formed}} internally by three longerons but the exterior was octagonal in cross section. [...] The pilots' enclosed cabin, fitted with side-by-side seating and dual control, {{was at the}} wing leading edge and above the mechanic's position. They communicated via a hatch. [...] The bomb-bay was behind the mechanic, under the wing, the bombs oriented according to weight. The largest, two [...] or four [...] bombs were held horizontally in parallel pairs but smaller bombs were arranged vertically, again in two rows. [...] The fourth crew-member was the navigator and radio operator, seated at mid-fuselage, though he became the gunner when required. There were two mid-fuselage machine gun positions, one dorsal (though the <b>early</b> <b>drawing</b> shows it just aft of the cockpit) and one ventral in retractable turrets, with a third, in a rotatable position in the extreme tail, under the rudder. An internal duralumin walled tunnel gave access between the rear cabin and the guns.|$|E
6000|$|... 74. Here (Fig. 4) is an <b>early</b> <b>drawing</b> of the myth, {{to which}} I {{shall have to}} refer {{afterwards}} in illustration of the childishness of the Greek mind {{at the time when}} its art-symbols were first fixed; but it is of peculiar value, because the physical character of Vulcan, as fire, is indicated by his wearing the [Greek: endromides] of Hermes, while the antagonism of Zeus, as the adverse chaos, either of cloud or of fate, is shown by his striking at Hephæstus with his thunderbolt. But Plate IV. gives you (as far as the light on the rounded vase will allow it to be deciphered) a characteristic representation of the scene, as conceived in later art.|$|E
6000|$|The {{history of}} the plates and dishes {{displayed}} in this kitchen would afford {{an opportunity for a}} dissertation on the rise and progress of the fine arts in this country, as they present most curious and important specimens of <b>early</b> <b>drawing,</b> painting, and poetry. The old English plate was a square piece of wood, which indeed is not quite obsolete at the present hour. The improvement upon this primitive plate was a circular platter, with a raised edge; but there were also thin, circular, flat plates of beech-wood in use for the dessert or confection, and they were gilt and painted upon one side, and inscribed with pious, or instructive, or amorous mottoes, suited to the taste of the society in which they were produced. Such circular plates are now well known to antiquaries under the name of “roundels,” and were at one time generally supposed by them to have been used as cards for fortune-telling, or playing with at questions and answers. More sober research into their origin and use shows that they were painted and decorated with conventional patterns by nuns, who left blank spaces for the mottoes, to be supplied by the more learned monks; and a set of these roundels generally consisted of twelve. As specimens of the style of these mottoes about the time of Henry VII. or VIII. the following may be taken:— ...|$|E
