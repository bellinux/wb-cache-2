2500|$|Similar {{to one of}} {{the most}} {{enduring}} myths about LSD, and also somewhat related to the [...] "multi-day impairment" [...] legend described further down on this list, this legend claims that residual THC stored in fat cells gets released spontaneously into the bloodstream in enough quantities to get one high again long after the last use of cannabis, be it days, weeks, or even months later. [...] This legend is typically accompanied by anecdotal evidence of people who experience a [...] "high" [...] after doing exercise of some sort. While somewhat more biologically plausible than the discredited LSD legend due to the fat-solubility of THC, this phenomenon remains scientifically unproven. [...] A 2009 study of rats that involved injecting them with large quantities of THC (equivalent to 5-10 joints per day in humans) each day for ten days straight, then subjecting them to simulated severe stress or food deprivation led to double the blood levels of THC-COOH two days after the last THC exposure compared to rats that were neither stressed nor deprived of food. If such results occurred in humans, then it is theoretically possible for a chronic cannabis user to fail a drug test long after the usual <b>detection</b> <b>time</b> due to exercise, dieting, or severe stress shortly before the test—and several anecdotal reports of this exist. [...] However, there is currently no hard evidence that enough active THC would be released to get one [...] "high" [...] or cause [...] "flashbacks." [...] One should also note that flashbacks from psychoactive drugs in general are now known to be psychological phenomena, and drug residues typically play no significant role in their occurrence and recurrence.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the trend}} for initial <b>detection</b> <b>times</b> using both passive and active sonar during submarine-on-submarine operations. Specifically, it simulates a nuclear powered submarine (SSN) {{searching for a}} diesel submarine {{in an environment where}} the SSN has a speed advantage and active sonar detection ranges exceed passive sonar detection ranges. The simulation uses a mover-sensor discrete event application of SIMKIT, developed by Professor Buss, Arnold The simulation results show that initial <b>detection</b> <b>times</b> of a search follow an exponential trend as a function of SSN speed, diesel submarine speed, detection ranges, ping interval and detection probability. As a result, as detection ranges continue to decrease due to increases in sound quieting technology, initial <b>detection</b> <b>times</b> during a submarine search will increase exponentially. This can render a passive sonar prosecution ineffective when combating a modern diesel submarine. Should SSN use active sonar, initial <b>detection</b> <b>times</b> can be significantly reduced, especially if combined with an effective search path. The threat to the SSN of using active sonar can be mitigated by judicious consideration of ping interval and search speed with detection probability and active detection ranges.

40|$|The {{concept of}} "free flight" is {{intended}} to emphasize more flexibility for operators in the National Airspace System (RTCA, 1995). This may include the potential for aircraft self-separation. The purpose of this simulation was to begin examining some of the communication and procedural issues associated with self-separation in an integrated air-ground environment. Participants were 10 commercial U. S. flight crews who flew the B 747 - 400 simulator and 10 Denver ARTCC controllers who monitored traffic in an ATC simulation. A prototypic airborne alerting logic and flight deck display features were designed to allow for increased traffic and maneuvering information. Eight different scenarios representing different conflict types were developed. The effects of traffic density (high and low) and different traffic convergence angles (obtuse, acute, and right) were assessed. Conflict <b>detection</b> <b>times</b> {{were found to be}} lower for the flight crews in low density compared to high density scenarios. For the controllers, an interaction between density and convergence angle was revealed.

40|$|Abstract — We {{analyze the}} RTO {{algorithm}} standardized for TCP and SCTP [RFC 2988] that is widely {{deployed in the}} Internet, {{referred to as the}} RFC 2988 -RTO in this paper. We briefly demonstrate three well-known problems of the RFC 2988 -RTO. We then develop a new RTO algorithm called the Peak-Hopper-RTO (PH-RTO) that eliminates the mentioned problems. Through extensive simulations in ns 2, we evaluate the effectiveness of both RTO algorithms. The key advantage of the PH-RTO over the RFC 2988 -RTO is its predictability. Although the RFC 2988 -RTO often exhibits low loss <b>detection</b> <b>times,</b> it also exhibits frequent “RTO outliers ” that can lead to exceptionally long loss <b>detection</b> <b>times.</b> The loss <b>detection</b> <b>times</b> of the PH-RTO are much more closely spread around the mean.

40|$|Abstract The Atlantic meridional {{overturning}} circulation (MOC) {{is responsible}} for a climatically significant north-ward heat transport {{that is expected to}} decrease in response to anthropogenic global warming. Here, simulations from an ensemble of UK Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Models (HadGEM 1, HadGEM 2 and a 22 member per-turbed physics ensemble of HadCM 3 -like models) are used to evaluate <b>detection</b> <b>times</b> for different MOC observing strategies. Six different detection statistics are compared, including direct observations of the MOC at two latitudes (26 N and 50 N) and several multivariate detection vari-ables based on an optimal fingerprint of MOC change previously identified using HadCM 3 (Vellinga and Wood in Geophys Res Lett 31 (14) :L 14203, 2004). Using these models, and assuming perfectly observed conditions, we find no evidence to suggest that <b>detection</b> <b>times</b> would be significantly reduced by measuring the MOC at 50 N instead of (or in addition to) measurements at 26 N. Our results suggest that complementary observations of hydrographic properties in the North Atlantic may help reduce MOC <b>detection</b> <b>times,</b> but the benefits are not uni-versal across models, nor as large as previously suggested. In addition, <b>detection</b> <b>times</b> calculated using optimal fin-gerprint methods are sensitive to the model-dependent estimates of covariances describing internal climate vari-ability.
