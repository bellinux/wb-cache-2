Various physical data transducers are analyzed to determine which types are best suited for portable solid-state environmental recorders, and a discussion of information processing concentrates {{on the problems of}} high-density versus low-density digital data storage and on methods for effecting large-scale data reductions. Recent advances in integrated circuit electronics are evaluated in terms of suitability for use in instrumentation requiring both large-scale memory capacity and low power consumption. Results of the research include functional block diagrams of an ambient sea-noise recorder and a shipping-container <b>impact</b> <b>recorder.</b> [URL] United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|The {{harvesting}} {{of processing}} tomatoes is fully mechanised {{and it is}} well known that during harvest, fruits are subjected to mechanical stress causing physical injuries, including skin punctures, pulp and cell rupture. Some wireless sensors have been used for research during recent years with the main purpose of reducing the quality loss of tomato fruits by diminishing the number and intensity of impacts. In this study the IRD (<b>impact</b> <b>recorder</b> device) sensor was used to evaluate several tomato harvesters. The specific objectives were to evaluate the impacts during mechanical harvest using a wireless sensor, to determine the critical points at which damage occurs, and to assess the damage levels. Samples were taken to determine the influence of mechanical harvest on texture, or on other quality characteristics including percentage of damages. From the obtained data it has been possible to identify the critical points where the damages were produced for each one of the five harvester models examined. The highest risk of damage was in zone 1 of the combine—from the cutting system to the colour selector—because the impacts were of higher intensity and hit less absorbing surfaces than in zone 2 —from colour selector to discharge. The shaker and exit from the shaker are two of the harvester elements that registered the highest intensity impacts. By adjusting, in a specific way each harvester model, using the results from this research, it has been possible to reduce the tomato damage percentage from 20 to 29 % to less than 10 %. The funding of this work has been covered by: Navarre Government Concerted Project: "Damage Determination in Processing Tomato Harvesters in Navarre", and CICYT Project AGL 2000 - 081...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis {{is to use}} descant {{recorders}} (hereinafter recorder) as a therapeutic agent in children with behavioral difficulties. The main aim {{of the study is}} to analyze the impact of activities with the recorder on the problem phenomena in the behavior of selected individuals and further explore the views of preschool teachers of their own readiness to manage problem behavior in their classrooms. The theoretical part is mainly engaged in the therapeutic use of recorders and characteristics of problematic behavior. Considerable space is devoted to the review of options to promote desirable behavior in pre school children and areas of music therapy. With regard to the desired objectives mixed research is chosen in the practical part. Using a questionnaire opinions of preschool teachers on the issue of educational difficulties in children are collected and also the possibility to use the recorder for therapeutic purposes. The case studies demonstrate the <b>impact</b> of the <b>recorder</b> on the manifestations of problematic behavior. The conclusion summarizes the findings of the study.

40|$|To {{show the}} {{response}} of fluvial and torrential morphodynamics to climatic variations and neotectonics in the semi-arid mountains, the authors present a preliminary geomorphological study of the main geosystem of the Alyhnayn area. This level {{is located in the}} upstream part of the intramountainous valley of N'fis river belonging to the northern side of High-Atlas. Its geomorphological analysis, based on the distribution of alluvial deposits and their characterization, reveals an alluvial-fans/terrace system. The latter is formed by a surface modeled on glacis and lacerated by more or less deep ravines. It is arbitrarily attributed to the middle Quatemary age. The geometric and the morpholithostratigraphic analysis of its deposits show a local control of a sedimentation of fluvialtorrential and gravitational types. A complex slop deposit is embedded within the fluvial sequences. It can be explained by a drop of the base level related to neotectonics. The sedimentation process is caused by the reactivation of a preexisting fault in relation with the High-Atlas elevation. The evolution of the Quatemary morphogenesis of the Alhnayn area has been influenced by uplift and climatic changes. Neotectonics controls fluvial and torrential dynamics by the local morphostructural framework. The fluvial and afluvial fans environments responded differently to <b>recorder</b> <b>impacts.</b> Nous présentons la réponse des paléoenvironnements ayant régi le géosysteme principal d 7 Alhanayn correspondant 2 un cycle morphoclimatique élémentaire, inscrit dans un domaine intramontagneux en cours de surrection, aux rythmes de l'érosion et de la sédimentation en caractérisant la part aux controles climatique et tectonique. Ce niveau se localise dans un segment amont de la vallée méridienne nord-atlasique drainée par l'oued N'fis. Son analyse géomorphologique met en évidence qu'il s'agit d'un systeme de cones-terrase modelé en sa surface en glacis lacéré par des ravins plus ou moins profonds. 11 est attribué arbitrairement au Quaternaire moyen. L'analyse géométrique et morpholithostratigraphique de ses dép 6 ts mettent en évidence un controle local de la sédimentation de type fluvio-torrentiel et gravitaire lié 2 la réactivation d'une faille préexistante en relation avec la surrection haut-atlasique...|$|R
