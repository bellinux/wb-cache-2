40|$|The offset {{between the}} center {{lines of the}} {{polished}} <b>end-face</b> and the fiber core has {{a significant effect on}} coupling efficiency. The initial contact point and the contact force are two of the most important parameters that induce the offset. This study proposes an image assistant method to find the initial contact point and a mathematical model to estimate the contact force when fabricating the double-variable-curvature <b>end-face</b> of single mode glass fiber. The repeatability of finding the initial contact point via the vision assistant program is 0. 3 [*]μm. Based on the assumption of a large deflection, a mathematical model is developed to study the relationship between the contact force and the displacement of the lapping film. In order to verify the feasibility of the mathematical model, experiments, as well as DEFORM simulations, are carried out. The results show that the contact forces are alomst linearly proportional to the feed amounts of the lapping film and the errors are less than 9 %.

Data from compression testing commonly present a high dispersion, {{which has been}} attributed to effects of the specimen geometry, dimensions and of the degree of material compaction, as well as to problems in the specimen <b>end-faces,</b> such as their parallelism, orthogonality in relation to the compression axis and surface regularity. Specimen <b>end-face</b> regularization has been achieved through various techniques, such as adhering or non-adhering capping with various materials, mechanical grinding and systems involving special moulds.

40|$|In this dissertation, {{optical fibre}} surface plasmon {{resonance}} sensors {{based on a}} metallic array of sub-wavelength apertures are investigated. Metallic sub-wavelength apertures may be designed to support surface plasmon resonances that {{are sensitive to the}} surrounding environment when embedded at the <b>end-face</b> of an optical fibre. Factors contributing to the liquid refractive index sensitivity are explored systematically through simulation, theory, and experiment. The optical fibre sensor (OFS) is a novel sensing device based on surface plasmon resonance technology and metallic nanostructure materials. The sensitivity of the sensor can be tailored by designing a suitable periodic array of sub-wavelength apertures. In the sensing mechanism, liquids such as water, acetone and iso-propyl alcohol were used to test the sensing surface of the optical fibre <b>end-face.</b> The identification of different refractive indices can be achieved by measuring the wavelength difference variations of spectral features and the light intensity from the reflection spectra of the OFS. The proposed sensor is compact in size and suitable for remote sensing. The sensor needs only a small volume of the liquid being tested and it is easy to use. It is evident that experimental results are in good agreement with theoretical results. However, the result of this study determined that it is unlikely that an OFS based on a periodic metallic nanostructure at the fibre <b>end-face</b> will produce a sensor with superior sensitivity to variations in liquid refractive index (RI) as compared to cheaper existing technologies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{concentricity}} of {{the optical}} fiber micro lens affects the coupling efficiency of a laser module a lot. In this paper, {{the effect of}} the perpendicularity of the broken edge on the concentricity of the micro optical fiber <b>end-face</b> during the micro polishing process is studied. A mathematical model is derived to describe the variation of the material removal rate (MRR) when the tilt angles and amount of feed of the optical fiber are changed. An experiment is built to measure the concentricity of optical fiber with different tilt angles and feeds. The result shows that both of the dimensionless factor QAB and measured concentricity have the same tendency. The concentricity is better when the tilt angle is smaller and the amount of feed is larger. An improved polishing process is suggested. A good concentricity within 1 μm can be achieved when fabricate the double-variable curvatures <b>end-face</b> of the optical fiber...|$|R

40|$|High laser intensities {{are being}} {{transmitted}} through optical fibers {{in a growing}} number of applications. The author`s interest in laser initiation of explosives has led him to examine the transmission of Q-switched, Nd:YAG laser pulses through step-index, multimode, fused-silica fibers for a number of years. A common limiting process is a plasma-forming breakdown occurring at the fiber entrance face. The breakdown threshold at this face depends on the surface characteristics that result from the particular method of <b>end-face</b> preparation. In previous studies he examined entrance-face breakdown thresholds for several different mechanical polishing schedules, and also for several schedules of CO{sub 2 }-laser conditioning following mechanical polishing. In the present study he examined three <b>end-face</b> preparation methods that were based on the recent availability of exceptionally good cleaved surfaces for the fibers of interest. Using test procedures similar to those in past studies, he examined the cleaved fibers directly, fibers with cleaved surfaces that were subsequently flame polished, and fibers with cleaved surfaces that were subsequently conditioned with a CO{sub 2 } laser. All of these preparation methods resulted in fibers that showed a broader range of entrance-face breakdown conditions than found in past studies, together with a susceptibility to subsurface exit-face damage. By introducing additional cleaning steps with the cleaved surfaces, he was able to reduce the variability in breakdown thresholds observed after subsequent CO{sub 2 }-laser conditioning. A consistent location of exit-face damage sites indicates that subsurface fracturing occurs during the cleaving process, and that the subsequent <b>end-face</b> processing steps were not effective in mitigating damage at these sites. Threshold energies for entrance-face breakdown are also affected by the relation between incident laser energy and the resulting peak local fluence at this surface...|$|R

These first 2 m are associated with the so-called Excavation Damaged Zone (EDZ).

40|$|Focal ratio {{degradation}} (FRD) is a {{major contributor}} to light loss in astronomical instruments employing multimode optical fibres. We present a powerful diagnostic model that uniquely quantifies the various sources of FRD in multimode fibres. There are three main phenomena that can contribute to FRD: scattering, diffraction and modal diffusion. We propose a Voigt FRD model where the diffraction and modal diffusion are modelled by the Gaussian component and the <b>end-face</b> scattering is modelled by the Lorentzian component. The Voigt FRD model can be deconvolved into its Gaussian and Lorentzian components and used to analyse the contribution of each of the three major components. We used the Voigt FRD model to analyse the FRD of modern astronomical grade fibre for variations in (i) <b>end-face</b> surface roughness, (ii) wavelength, (iii) fibre length and (iv) external fibre stress. The elevated FRD we observed was mostly due to external factors, i. e. fibre end effects such as surface roughness, subsurface damage and environmentally induced microbending caused by the epoxy, ferrules and fibre cable design. The Voigt FRD model has numerous applications such as a diagnostic tool for current fibre instrumentation that show elevated FRD, as a quality control method for fibre manufacture and fibre cable assembly and as a research and development tool for the characterization of new fibre technologies. 11 page(s...|$|R
