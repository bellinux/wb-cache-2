References specifically support the paper and provide the information needed to identify and locate each source. The reference list appears {{at the end of the}} paper, is double-spaced within and between sources, and is arranged alphabetically by the surname of the first author. Sources without authors are arranged alphabetically by title within the same list. The first line of each reference is set flush left and second and subsequent lines are indented (<b>hanging</b> <b>indent).</b> Italics are preferred over the use of underlining.

40|$|Concrete cover {{provides}} {{the first line}} of defense against the ingress of many deleterious substances into the concrete. Therefore, a measure of its transport properties is vital in assessing its long term performance in a given exposure condition. In new structures the rate of ingress of the deleterious substances could be monitored using array of electrical sensors that are embedded in the cover concrete. For structures that are currently in service, tests can be performed by removing cores from the structure (lab based tests) or by using tests that can be performed on the surface (in situ tests). Results relating to few of the most commonly used lab based test methods are presented here along with two in situ permeability apparatuses, viz. Autoclam Permeability System (for measuring gas/water permeability and water absorption) and Permit Ion Migration Test (for determining rate of ionic ingress). Data from these test methods are further exploited using numerical models to predict the long term behaviour of structures exposed to chloride environment. The results from a long term study conducted at a marine exposure site presented in this document suggests that a combined approach of testing and modelling can be used to successfully to predict the long term behaviour of concrete structures. The abstract should summarize the contents of the paper and should contain at least 70 and at most 200 words.
