40|$|Based on {{our sample}} of 10095 galaxies with bulge-disc decompositions we derive the {{empirical}} B MGC-band internal attenuation–inclination relation for galaxy discs and their associated central bulges. Our results agree {{well with the}} independently derived dust models of Tuffs et al., leading to a direct constraint on the mean opacity of spiral discs of τ f B = 3. 8 ± 0. 7 (central face-on B MGC-band opacity). Depending on inclination, the B MGCband attenuation correction varies from 0. 2 – 1. 1 mag for discs and from 0. 8 – 2. 6 mag for bulges. We find that, overall, 37 per cent of all B MGC-band photons produced in discs in the nearby universe are absorbed by dust, a figure that rises to 71 per cent for bulge photons. The severity of <b>internal</b> <b>dust</b> extinction is such that one must incorporate <b>internal</b> <b>dust</b> corrections in all optical studies of large galaxy samples.

Using spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the P ÉGASE galaxy spectral evolution model we apply dust attenuation corrections to the G − R colors using the Witt & Gordon (2000) models for radiative transfer in dusty galactic environments {{to arrive at the}} UV attenuation factors. We show that the dust in the LBGs exhibit SMC-like characteristics rather than MW-like, and that the dust geometry in these systems is most likely to be represented by a clumpy shell configuration. We show that the attenuation factor exhibits a pronounced dependence on the luminosity of the LBG, a 1600 ∝ (L/L⊙) α, where 0. 5 ≤ α ≤ 1. 5. The exponent α depends on the initial parameters of the stellar population chosen to model the galaxies and the dust properties. We find that the luminosity weighted average attenuation factor is likely to be in the range from 5. 7 − 18. 5, which is consistent with the upper limits to the star formation rate at 2 < z < 4 set by the FIR background. This implies that the current UV/optical surveys do detect the bulk of the star formation during the epoch 2 < z < 4, but require substantial correction for <b>internal</b> <b>dust</b> attenuation.

We examine whether reliable Lya fluxes (F_Lya) and equivalent widths (W_Lya) can be estimated from narrowband imaging surveys and whether any observational biases may be present. We have developed software to simulate the observed line and continuum properties of synthetic LAEs in the distant universe by adopting various typical observational techniques. This was used to investigate how detected F_Lya and W_Lya vary with properties of the host or IGM: <b>internal</b> <b>dust</b> reddening; intervening Lya absorption systems; the presence of underlying stellar populations. None of the techniques studied are greatly susceptible to underlying stellar populations or the contribution of nebular gas. We find that techniques that use one off-line filter on the red side of Lya result in highly inaccurate measurements of W_Lya. Adopting two off-line filters to estimate continuum at Lya is an improvement but is still unreliable when dust extinction is considered. Techniques that employ single narrow- and broad-band filters with the same central wavelength are not susceptible to <b>internal</b> <b>dust,</b> but IGM Lya absorption can cause W_Lya to be overestimated by factors of up to 2 : at z= 6, the median W_Lya is overestimated by ~ 25 %. The most robust approach is a SED fitting technique that fits E(B-V) and burst-age from synthetic models - broadband observations are needed that sample the UV continuum slope, 2175 AA dust feature, and the 4000 AA discontinuity.

The SN extinction curves used in this work were obtained from models of unmixed ejecta of type II supernovae(SNe II) for the Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) with a mass range from 8 to 30 M_sun or 8 to 40 M_sun. The effect of dust distributions on the attenuation of starlight is investigated by performing the chi-square fitting method against various dust distributions. These are the commonly used uniform dust screen, the clumpy dust screen, and the <b>internal</b> <b>dust</b> geometry. We add to these geometries three scattering properties, namely, no-scattering, isotropic scattering, and forward-only scattering. Judging from the chi-square values, {{we find that the}} uniform screen models with any scattering property provide good approximations to the real <b>dust</b> geometry. <b>Internal</b> <b>dust</b> is inefficient to attenuate starlight and thus cannot be the dominant source of the extinction. We show that the SN extinction curves reproduce the data of SST J 1604 + 4304 comparable to or better than the Calzetti extinction curve. The Milky Way extinction curve is not in satisfactory agreement with the data unless several dusty clumps are in the line of sight. This trend may be explained by the abundance of SN-origin dust in these galaxies; SN dust is the most abundant in the young IR galaxy at z = 1, abundant in local starbursts, and less abundant in the Galaxy.

The soft X-ray variability makes electron scattering of most of the soft X-rays difficult without a very peculiar scattering mirror. The lack of significant intrinsic cold X-ray absorption together with the large observed E(B-V) suggests either a very peculiar system geometry or, more probably, absorption by warm ionized gas with <b>internal</b> <b>dust.</b> There is evidence for an ionized oxygen edge in the X-ray spectrum. IRAS 13349 + 2438 has many properties that {{are similar to those of}} the Osterbrockian `narrow-line' Seyfert 1 s. Comment: uuencoded compressed postscript.

40|$|We report deep Subaru Halpha {{observations}} of the XUV disk of M 83. These new observations enable the first complete census of very young stellar clusters over the entire XUV disk. Combining Subaru and GALEX data with a stellar population synthesis model, we find that (1) the standard, but stochastically-sampled, initial mass function (IMF) is preferred over the truncated IMF, because there are low mass stellar clusters (10 ^{ 2 - 3 }Msun) that host massive O-type stars; that (2) the standard Salpeter IMF and a simple aging effect explain the counts of FUV-bright and Halpha-bright clusters with masses > 10 ^ 3 Msun; and that (3) the Halpha to FUV flux ratio over the XUV disk supports the standard IMF. The Subaru Prime Focus Camera (Suprime-Cam) covers a large area even outside the XUV disk [...] far beyond the detection limit of the HI gas. This enables us to statistically separate the stellar clusters in the disk from background contamination. The new data, model, and previous spectroscopic studies provide overall consistent results {{with respect to the}} <b>internal</b> <b>dust</b> extinction (Av~ 0. 1 mag) and low metallicity (~ 0. 2 Zsun) using the dust extinction curve of SMC.
