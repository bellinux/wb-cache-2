Based on the web-based ontology modeling language, a descriptive model to describe the heterogeneous knowledge resources of the pig <b>diseases</b> <b>diagnosis</b> and a formal model to express the decision services of pig diseases are proposed in this work. Based on the two models, a complex decision task can be automatically divided into many dependent simple decision fragments. The relationships between different fragments, the mapping relationships between each fragment which can be dynamically adjusted according the divided fragments and its distributed knowledge resources can be formally described. The models form a mechanism for cooperative decision for pig <b>diseases</b> <b>diagnosis.</b> The method is proposed by achieving the balanced decomposition of decision task and intelligent schedule of knowledge resources. The method is verified in a pig <b>diseases</b> collaborative <b>diagnosis</b> system. The result shows that the method is superior to the traditional intelligent decision-making method...|$|R

25|$|While most {{molecular}} epidemiology studies are still using conventional <b>disease</b> <b>diagnosis</b> and classification systems, {{it is increasingly}} recognized that disease evolution represents inherently heterogeneous processes differing from person to person. Conceptually, each individual has a unique disease process {{different from any other}} individual (“the unique disease principle”), considering uniqueness of the exposome (a totality of endogenous and exogenous / environmental exposures) and its unique influence on molecular pathologic process in each individual. Studies {{to examine the relationship between}} an exposure and molecular pathologic signature of disease (particularly cancer) became increasingly common throughout the 2000s. However, the use of molecular pathology in epidemiology posed unique challenges including lack of research guidelines and standardized statistical methodologies, and paucity of interdisciplinary experts and training programs. Furthermore, the concept of disease heterogeneity appears to conflict with the long-standing premise in epidemiology that individuals with the same disease name have similar etiologies and disease processes. To resolve these issues and advance population health science in the era of molecular precision medicine, “molecular pathology” and “epidemiology” was integrated to create a new interdisciplinary field of “molecular pathological epidemiology” (MPE), defined as “epidemiology of molecular pathology and heterogeneity of disease”. In MPE, investigators analyze the relationships between; (A) environmental, dietary, lifestyle and genetic factors; (B) alterations in cellular or extracellular molecules; and (C) evolution and progression of disease. A better understanding of heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis will further contribute to elucidate etiologies of disease. The MPE approach can be applied to not only neoplastic diseases but also non-neoplastic diseases. The concept and paradigm of MPE have become widespread in the 2010s.|$|E

2500|$|Gastrointestinal diseases: {{people with}} {{gastrointestinal}} disorders {{may be more}} risk of developing disorders eating practices than the general population, principally restrictive eating disturbances. An association of anorexia nervosa with celiac disease has been found. The role that gastrointestinal symptoms play {{in the development of}} eating disorders seems rather complex. Some authors report that unresolved symptoms prior to gastrointestinal <b>disease</b> <b>diagnosis</b> may create a food aversion in these persons, causing alterations to their eating patterns. Other authors report that greater symptoms throughout their diagnosis led to greater risk.

On the other hand, individuals with good dietary management may develop anxiety, food aversion and eating disorders because of concerns around cross contamination of their foods. Some authors suggest that medical professionals should evaluate the presence of an unrecognized celiac disease in all people with eating disorder, especially if they present any gastrointestinal symptom (such as [...] decreased appetite, abdominal pain, bloating, distension, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation), weight loss, or growth failure; and also routinely ask celiac patients about [...] weight or body shape concerns, dieting or vomiting for weight control, to evaluate the possible presence of eating disorders, especially in women.|$|E
