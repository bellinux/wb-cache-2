For extended settings of typefaces graphic designers often use nonsense text (commonly referred to as <b>greeking),</b> such as lorem ipsum or Latin text such as the beginning of Cicero's In Catilinam. <b>Greeking</b> is used in typography to determine a typeface's colour, or weight and style, and to demonstrate an overall typographic aesthetic prior to actual type setting.|$|E

In the early 1990s the <b>Greek</b> Orthodox Community of Wellington published {{a collection of}} <b>Greek</b> recipes contributed {{by members of the}} <b>Greek</b> community.

New Zealand <b>Greeks</b> have established the popular <b>Greek</b> food brands Zany Zeus, which manufactures organic milk and award-winning boutique cheese, Elysian Foods which produces taramosalata and tzatziki, and Giannis Pita Products which manufactures pita bread and pit bread chips. Although {{there are only a few}} restaurants specialising in <b>Greek</b> food currently operating in New Zealand, many Mediterranean restaurants include <b>Greek</b> dishes on their menu. <b>Greek</b> restaurants include Moyses in Wellington; The Santorini <b>Greek</b> Ouzeri and Costas Taverna <b>Greek</b> Restaurant and Ouzo Bar in Christchurch and Zorba <b>Greek</b> Restaurant in Auckland.|$|R

At <b>Greek</b> Festivals you will typically find <b>Greek</b> gourmet food, <b>Greek</b> folk music - usually performed by <b>Greek</b> bands, cultural exhibitions including artifacts from Greece and dances performed in costumes of old tradition, and dancing for the public under <b>Greek</b> tunes.

5000|$|<b>Greeking</b> is a {{style of}} {{displaying}} or rendering text or symbols, not always from the Greek alphabet. <b>Greeking</b> obscures portions of a work {{for the purpose of}} either emphasizing form over details or displaying placeholders for unavailable content.

50|$|In {{publishing}} and graphic design, lorem ipsum is a filler text or <b>greeking</b> {{commonly used to}} demonstrate the textual elements of a graphic document or visual presentation.

50|$|<b>Greeking</b> is {{also used}} when a design is being {{developed}} but the content is unfinished. One example might be the layout of a magazine article which has photographs but no text; initially, a lorem ipsum text is used, and then the nonsense text is replaced with draft versions as they become available. This allows design and layout {{to be carried out}} in parallel with content revisions.|$|E
40|$|After Ottoman colonial rule, {{education}} in Greece {{became an important}} institution for the ideological construction of a <b>Greek</b> national identity. This paper looks at schooling in Greece {{just prior to the}} <b>Greek</b> Revolution and immediately after <b>Greek</b> Independence, and how the <b>Greek</b> national school system assisted in the construction of a <b>Greek</b> national identity. This paper is divided into several sections. The introductory section discusses how a newly independent <b>Greek</b> nation-state struggled to unite the <b>Greek</b> people under a collective national identity. While most people at the time identified with their families, communities, and <b>Greek</b> Orthodox Christian religion, after <b>Greek</b> independence people began to see themselves as members of a broader <b>Greek</b> nation. The section that follows provides a discussion of <b>Greek</b> education during Ottoman colonial rule, and how a type of <b>Greek</b> identity (centered around the <b>Greek</b> Orthodox Christian faith) was maintained through the <b>Greek</b> Orthodox mileu. The <b>Greek</b> Church ran schools, and taught <b>Greek</b> children how to read and write, as well as the virtues of the Orthodox Christian faith. Section three of the article looks at <b>Greek</b> education {{during the early years of}} the <b>Greek</b> nation-state. In this section the general contours of the <b>Greek</b> educational system are delineated. The section also discusses how the organization of the <b>Greek</b> national school system was borrowed from extant school models found in Western Europe. Section four describes the <b>Greek</b> national curriculum and how the national curriculum would help to teach future generations of <b>Greek</b> citizens what it meant to be <b>Greek.</b> This is further reinforced in the <b>Greek</b> school textbook, which is part of the discussion in section five. Section five concludes with the role of education and its implications in uniting nations from around the world...|$|R

5000|$|The term [...] "greeking" [...] {{was applied}} by various WYSIWYG {{editors of the}} 1980s, of the type {{exemplified}} by ApplixWare and Island Graphics. <b>Greeking</b> referred to the literal replacement of a poorly imaged sequence of text with a literal gray bar upon moving out of focus.

50|$|Filler text (also {{placeholder}} text or dummy text) is text that shares some {{characteristics of a}} real written text, but is random or otherwise generated.

The process of using filler text is sometimes called <b>greeking,</b> although the text itself may be nonsense, or largely Latin, as in Lorem ipsum.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Greek</b> festival or <b>Greek</b> Fest is {{an annual}} celebration of <b>Greek</b> culture {{presented}} by many ethnic <b>Greek</b> American communities and {{organization in the}} United States and Canada, particularly <b>Greek</b> Orthodox churches. Typically, these events are intended for attendance by the general public. Attendees can sample <b>Greek</b> music, cuisine, and dance, typically performed in traditional dress. Such events are often fundraisers for Orthodox churches of the <b>Greek</b> Archdiocese. These <b>Greek</b> festivals originate from celebrations in Greece for religious holidays, such as, <b>Greek</b> Orthodox Easter and non-religious holidays, such as, the Festival of Flowers (Protomayia).|$|R
50|$|Most <b>Greeks</b> are Christians, {{belonging}} to the <b>Greek</b> Orthodox Church. During the first centuries after Jesus Christ, the New Testament was originally written in Koine <b>Greek,</b> which remains the liturgical language of the <b>Greek</b> Orthodox Church, {{and most of the}} early Christians and Church Fathers were Greek-speaking. There are small groups of ethnic <b>Greeks</b> adhering to other Christian denominations like <b>Greek</b> Catholics, <b>Greek</b> Evangelicals, Pentecostals, and groups adhering to other religions including Romaniot and Sephardic Jews and <b>Greek</b> Muslims. About 2,000 <b>Greeks</b> are members of Hellenic Polytheistic Reconstructionism congregations.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} perceptions of <b>Greek</b> students by four specific groups of people: undergraduate <b>Greek</b> students, undergraduate students who are not members of <b>Greek</b> organizations, <b>Greek</b> alumni, and hiring personnel. In addition, hiring professionals’ opinions and perceptions of <b>Greek</b> students were further explored to determine whether membership in a <b>Greek</b> organization is seen as an asset or a liability in the workforce. Attained or expected skills as a result of membership in a <b>Greek</b> organization were also elicited from <b>Greek</b> students, <b>Greek</b> alumni, and hiring personnel. Data analysis of stereotype responses showed that <b>Greek</b> students and <b>Greek</b> alumni tend to hold more favorable opinions of those involved in <b>Greek</b> organizations, and the belief of both groups differed from beliefs held by both non-Greek students and hiring personnel...|$|R
5000|$|As in typography, <b>greeking</b> {{involves}} inserting nonsense text or, commonly, Greek or Latin text in prototypes {{of visual}} media projects (such as in graphic and web design) {{to check the}} layout of the final version before the actual text is available, or to enhance layout assessment by eliminating the distraction of readable text. Text of this sort is known as [...] "greeked text", [...] "dummy text", or [...] "jabberwocky text". Lorem ipsum is a commonly used example, though this is derived from Latin, not Greek.|$|E

Dónal just played guitar then but he came round to my place {{and there was this}} bouzouki there and he picked it up and started playing it immediately, even though it was right-handed and he was left-handed. I thought 'Wow, that's a talent I haven't seen before.' And he was saying 'This is great, I need to get one of these' and by that time I'd gone off the bouzouki because I thought the strings were a little slack and I'd gone back to the mandolin so I said 'Have it' and I gave it to him. —Andy Irvine, The <b>Greeking</b> of the Irish by Colin Irwin.|$|E
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. This thesis {{analyzes}} modern <b>Greek</b> enlightenment and 19 th century <b>Greek</b> Nationalism, {{in the light}} of nationalism theories.
