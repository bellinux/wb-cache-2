500|$|Carter {{awarded the}} [...] "Season of Infamy" [...] content a 7.5 out of 10. He {{felt that the}} Mad Hatter mission was [...] "the weakest link in the chain," [...] calling it [...] "a neat concept but it's so {{fleeting}} that <b>I</b> <b>barely</b> had time to digest it." [...] For Killer Croc's, Carter said the mission was [...] "a predictable storyline" [...] since Killer Croc is generally portrayed as a [...] "one-dimensional" [...] foe, though [...] "t works better than Mad Hatter's portion... because most of it isn't [...] re-used environments, {{and there is a}} nice brief reunion with Nightwing." [...] Speaking of the Mister Freeze mission, Carter called the exploration of Freeze's relationship with his wife Nora [...] "compelling" [...] and enjoyed the fact it was the only [...] "Season of Infamy" [...] mission to feature a predator challenge. Additionally, he added that the Batmobile sequence had [...] "more of a reason to exist than most of the ones in the campaign." [...] Finally, Carter called the Ra's al Ghul mission [...] "the other highlight of the pack" [...] and felt the choice the mission gave players at the end was [...] "pretty interesting". He also added the setting of Elliot General Hospital was a good way to highlight Hush's family legacy since his [...] "part in [...] was extremely disappointing".|$|E

Without cave diving training, Sorenson said, {{there was no}} way Ben could have gotten through some of the {{narrower}} passages, called restrictions by divers, in the cave. [...] "I know what I'm doing and <b>I</b> <b>barely</b> made it through," [...] he told the Commercial Appeal. [...] "The last place I searched was pristine, without a mark that a diver had been there. It would be impossible to go through that restriction without making a mark on the floor or ceiling. He's not in there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Duvall {{served in}} the United States Army {{for a brief period}} shortly after the Korean War (from August 19, 1953, to August 20, 1954) leaving the Army as private first class. [...] "That's led to some {{confusion}} in the press," [...] he explained in 1984, [...] "Some stories have me shooting it out with the Commies from a foxhole over in Frozen Chosin. Pork Chop Hill stuff. Hell, <b>I</b> <b>barely</b> qualified with the M-1 rifle in basic training". While stationed at Camp Gordon (later renamed Fort Gordon) in Georgia, Duvall acted in an amateur production of the comedy Room Service in nearby Augusta, Georgia.|$|E

2500|$|Blagojevich {{graduated}} from Chicago's Foreman High School after transferring from Lane Technical High School. He played basketball {{in high school}} and participated in two fights after training as a Golden Gloves boxer. After graduation, he enrolled at the University of Tampa. After two years, he transferred to Northwestern University in suburban Evanston, where he graduated in 1979 with a B.A. in history. He earned his J.D. from the Pepperdine University School of Law in 1983. He later said of the experience: [...] "I went to law school at a place called Pepperdine in Malibu, California, overlooking the Pacific Ocean — a lot of surfing and movie stars and all the rest. <b>I</b> <b>barely</b> knew where that law library was." [...] Blagojevich is married to Patricia Mell, the daughter of former Chicago alderman Richard Mell.|$|E
2500|$|... "Who Ya Gonna Call?" [...] was {{the only}} episode {{directed}} by Michael Lange. The episode was the first installment written by co-executive producers Kerry Lenhart and John J. Sakmar, who later collaborated with Douglas Steinberg to write the season's fourteenth episode, [...] "Poker? <b>I</b> <b>Barely</b> Know Her". Tracey Jeffery was the episode's producer, John J. Sakmar and Jerry Lenhart were the consulting producers, and Mel Damski, Steve Franks, Kelly Kulchak, and Chris Henze were the associate producers. Erin Smith was the production manager. Tracy Hillman was the installment's associate producer, and Michael McMurray {{was the director of}} photography, while Allan Lee and Anupam Nigam acted as the editors. David Crabtree, James Ilecic, Allan Lee, and Gordon Rempel were the script editors. The music for the episode was written by Adam Cohen and John Robert Wood. Assistant directors for the installment were Jack Hardy and Roger Russell.|$|E
2500|$|Eden Riegel {{was cast}} in 2000 as Bianca Montgomery, the lesbian {{daughter}} of Erica Kane. Riegel left the role and returned several times, before permanently retiring from the role in 2010. [...] She attributed her 2008 return to the wishes of her fans. Through the web presence she created for herself during her web series Imaginary Bitches, fans let her know how much they wanted {{her back on the}} show. [...] "I definitely wanted to fulfill that desire if I could," [...] she said. Riegel then let the show know she was willing to come back. [...] " [...] next thing I knew I got a call and they said, 'Okay, we've got something for you,'" [...] she said. The story the All My Children writers came up with involved a new love interest for Bianca, Reese Williams, who would be portrayed by daytime alumni Tamara Braun. Riegel addressed specific reasons she made the return. [...] "It was the storyline that got me excited," [...] she said. [...] "I always want to come back. I love All My Children, and they’re my family. <b>I</b> <b>barely</b> need an excuse -- it’s usually just about timing." [...] Riegel added that [...] "this time {{it was the fact that}} they were going to have Bianca in a committed relationship". She stated, [...] "It was very, very important to me, and I was so glad to hear that. In the context of that, there’s some pretty exciting story line plot points that I’m aware of that are dramatic and fun to play and enticing as an actress." [...] In addition, Riegel was enthused about playing opposite Braun. [...] "It means so much [...] because it shows how committed AMC is to this pairing," [...] Riegel said in an interview with Soap Opera Weekly. [...] "We're going to have some serious stuff to play- they aren't going to waste her talents." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jones pairing with Billy Sherrill at Epic Records {{came as a}} {{surprise}} to many; Sherrill and business partner Glenn Sutton are regarded as the defining influences of the countrypolitan sound, a smooth amalgamation of pop and country music that was popular during the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, a far cry from George's honky tonk roots. [...] Despite a shaky start, the success that Sherrill had with Jones proved to be his most enduring; although Billboard chart statistics show that Sherrill had his biggest commercial successes with artists such as Wynette and Charlie Rich, with Jones Sherrill had his most longest-lasting association. [...] In Sherrill, Jones found what Andrew Meuller of Uncut described as [...] "the producer capable of creating the epically lachrymose arrangements his voice deserved and his torment demanded...He summoned for Jones the symphonies of sighing strings that almost made the misery of albums like 1974's The Grand Tour and 1976's Alone Again sound better than happiness could possibly feel." [...] In 1974, they scored a number one hit with the instant classic [...] "The Grand Tour" [...] and followed that with [...] "The Door" [...] (I've heard the sound of my dear old mother cryin'/and the sound of the train that took me off to war), another number one smash. [...] Unlike most singers, who might have been overwhelmed by the string arrangements and background vocalists Sherrill sometimes employed on his records, Jones' voice, with its at times frightening intensity and lucid tone, could stand up to anything. [...] While Jones wrote fewer songs himself - songwriters had been tripping over themselves pitching songs to him for years - he still managed to co-write several, such as [...] "What My Woman Can't Do" [...] (also recorded by Jerry Lee Lewis), [...] "A Drunk Can't Be A Man", the harrowing [...] "I Just Don't Give a Damn" [...] (perhaps the greatest [...] "lost classic" [...] in the entire Jones catalogue) and [...] "These Days (<b>I</b> <b>Barely</b> Get By)", which he had written with Wynette.|$|E
