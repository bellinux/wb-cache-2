40|$|The {{spreading}} {{of fabric}} onto cutting tables in several layers, and the cutting of this fabric {{in the most}} cost-efficient manner to produce a pre-determined number of garments is the apparel manufacturing phase that precedes assembly (sewing) and finishing. The problem consists of determining the lowest cost spreading and cutting schedule for garments of different styles, colors, and sizes, subject to physical constraints of cutting table length and cutting <b>knife</b> <b>height</b> as well as business constraints of required demand for each stock-keeping unit (SKU). The determination of this optimal spreading and cutting schedule for various garment styles is a difficult combinatorial NP-complete optimization problem. This paper proposes {{the use of an}} innovative state-space approach using heuristic rules to solve the problem: it is modeled as a least-cost search in a graph where each node represents a different spreading and cutting schedule. Several solution algorithms and heuristics are proposed and tested and an illustrative application to a Brazilian apparel company is presented.

30|$|According to Koch [5], {{quality of}} peripheral-planed {{surfaces}} is generally improved by short wavelengths (or feed per <b>knife)</b> and low <b>height</b> of <b>knife</b> marks. This is generally accomplished {{by increasing the}} cutting circle diameter, number of jointed knives, or by reducing feed speed. Indeed, reduction in feed speed decreases the normal cutting force [5, 6] by reducing chip dimensions. Rake angle and jointing operation are also important factors influencing surface quality during planing process. For several species, better surface quality is observed as rake angle decreases from 30 ° to 15 ° [7 – 9], whereas the effect of jointing operation depends on wood species and knife wear [3, 10, 11]. On the other hand, Carrano et al. [6] reported an increase in surface quality when decreasing the depth of cut. However, Iskra and Hernández [12] found that surface quality is not affected by depth of cut during routing paper birch wood with different grain orientations. Difference between these two studies {{could be related to}} the efficiency of feeding systems used for conducting the experiments (vibrational effects).|$|R
