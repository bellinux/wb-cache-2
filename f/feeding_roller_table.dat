40|$|A common {{method of}} feeding the stock {{material}} into the press is bypassing it through a pair of <b>feed</b> <b>rollers</b> which apply friction to the material and rotate in a cooperative manner to feed the stock in to the punch press.

Stepping motors are widely used in robotics and in the numerical control of machine tools to perform high precision positioning operations. The principal object of this invention is to provide a strip stock feeding mechanism that is suitable for feeding any desired length of stock for each cycle and which may be very easily adjusted for various lengths of feed.

50|$|A burster is {{a machine}} that {{separates}} one-part continuous form paper into separate, individual, sheets along the transverse perforations. A burster was typically used with printed continuous form paper applications such as mass-mail advertising, invoices, and account statements. Bursting is done by firmly gripping the second-to-last sheet while <b>feed</b> <b>rollers</b> grip the last sheet firmly and pull it away to burst the perforation. The continuous form paper then advances into the <b>feed</b> <b>rollers</b> to burst the next sheet. Bursting is often a high-speed process that allows the continuous form paper to feed in at a steady rate, with burst pages either stacked or fed into a single-sheet conveyance to the next paper processing stage. Burster equipment and paper manufactures had to generate perforation specifications so that the paper perforations reliably separated under the force of pulling the sheets apart and not tear down into the printed part of the sheet.|$|R

The post-harvest assessments of industrial round-wood (IRW) processing damage, fuel consumption and productivity were examined in clearcutting operations. Observations were made of seven combinations of wear levels of <b>feed</b> <b>rollers</b> (A—heavy, B—medium, C and C’—without wear) and sharpening states of delimbing knives (1 —incorrect, 2 —correct), depending {{on the degree of}} <b>feed</b> <b>roller</b> wear and matching of angles of knife blades to the technical requirements. The processing defects of IRW were broken down into unprocessed branches, bark stripping, and damage caused by <b>feed</b> <b>roller</b> spikes. The results were then compared with the effective quality requirements, and the IRW losses in terms of the reject rates (RR) were determined {{in the context of the}} technical condition. The most frequent damage was by unprocessed branches. The harvester with correctly sharpened knives produced the minimum RR (4 % of pine, 6 % of spruce and 6 % birch logs). The quality of IRW harvested under B 1 and C 1 resulted in 6 %, 6 % and 8 %. A 1 turned out to be the lowest (12 %, 10 % and 8 %). Improvement in the maintenance of delimbing knives can reduce the RR of IRW by 5 %. Timely restoration of worn-out rollers can increase productivity by 2 % and reduce fuel consumption by 5 %...|$|R

40|$|Rotor spun yarn, {{despite its}} growing popularity, suffers the {{disadvantages}} of lower tenacity, limited count range, and harsh {{handle of the}} resulting fabrics. Therefore, this work probes the possibility of eliminating these drawbacks by using tensile drawing. The yarns are produced with different specifications from the same fibers. The results are encouraging, since contrary to predictions, staple yarns treated this way do perform properly. Tensile drawing especially improves rotor spun yarn quality in terms of structural/mechanical evenness and processability. Other features include increased packing density, reduced yarn diameter, enhanced mechanical rigidity, and even the potential for larger tenacity. The influence of processing variables on yarn properties is also revealed by examining {{the contribution of the}} number of yarn loops mounted on the <b>feed</b> <b>roller</b> and rewinding to drawing and the resulting products. The number of yarn loops wound on the <b>feed</b> <b>roller</b> is significant in terms of drawing tension. Optimum drawing can be obtained without rewinding in terms of better yarn properties and economics, though rewinding can effectively eliminate fiber breakage. Moreover, the truely critical factor in the drawing extent should be drawing tension rather than the so-called drawing ratio. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R

40|$|Issue: Windshields are {{manufactured}} with {{two layers of}} glass with a strong plastic (usually PVC) membrane sandwiched between the panes. This structure limits recyclability dramatically. Plate glass itself is challenging to recycle because of its different chemical composition from container glass. Plate glass and automotive glass can be successfully recycled into construction aggregate or other secondary markets if the glass can {{be separated from the}} film. Separating film plastic from windshield glass requires that the glass be broken adequately to free the film, while keeping the film in large enough pieces that it can be removed without fouling equipment.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} interest worldwide in using tree harvesting biomass as an energy source. Bark retained on logs {{is commonly used}} as an energy source, but is generally removed from eucalypt logs during harvest. In order to evaluate the potential use of eucalypt bark as fuel, {{there is a need}} for information on the productivity and cost implications of retaining eucalypt bark during harvest operations. The study examined the impact of retaining bark on logs on the productivity and costs of a whole-tree to roadside harvesting system in a short-rotation Eucalyptus nitens plantation in Australia being harvested for pulp logs. Trees were felled and bunched with a feller-buncher in spring, then left infield for four weeks to promote bark adhesion and reduce bark loss. A skidder extracted the trees to roadside where a processor processed them to predominantly 10 m logs. Machine productivities were calculated from estimated tree and log volumes and cycle times recorded from video recordings. The feller-buncher's productivity (65 m 3) was less than expected as it appeared to be underpowered to handle the larger trees on the study site. The skidder's productivity (56 m 3) was comparable to those reported in studies under similar conditions and with bark retained. The roadside processor's productivity (25 m 3) was lower than expected. This was believed to result from the operator separately stacking 10 m and 5 m logs, and the lower feed speed resulting from slippage due to the reduced <b>feed</b> <b>roller</b> pressure used in the study to reduce bark loss. Future research could identify <b>feed</b> <b>rollers</b> that increase <b>feed</b> speed while retaining bark. Harvest system costs (AUD 18 GMt− 1) were similar to those reported for a eucalypt roadside processing trial where bark was removed. These results suggest that retaining bark on the logs at roadside did not affect the harvesting system's productivity or costs...|$|R

Survival, growth, intermoult period, growth factor and intermoult growth rate of subadult mysids (4 - 10 mm standard length) were monitored over 4. 5 weeks in a <b>roller</b> <b>table.</b> In a first experiment, the effect of tidal dynamics on the floc formation process, {{as well as on the}} floc size and shape was followed. Also, we evaluated the effect of continuous rotation in the roller tanks on the growth of N. integer to be negligible. Subsequently, we performed a growth experiment with N. integer reared on the laboratory-made aggregates and estimated the feeding rate. The estuarine aggregates are a valuable food source for the mysids as they showed good survival (80 %) and grew substantially on this dietary item (0. 08 ± 0. 01 mm d - 1), although growth is slower than on Artemia nauplii (0. 11 ± 0. 01 mm d - 1). The high feeding rate of subadult Neomysis integer on the laboratory-made flocs (38 flocs ind - 1), may compensate for their low energetic value. The <b>roller</b> <b>table</b> is an adequate tool for feeding experiments with N. integer on the fragile estuarine aggregates. For Neomysis integer living in the maximum turbidity zone of estuaries, the estuarine flocs may be an important additional food source, especially in periods when mesozooplankton prey (mainly calanoid copepods) is scarce. The rich bacterial and protozoan communities associated to the flocs as well as the incorporated amorphous organic matter, normally too small to be efficiently consumed by mysids, become part of their diet. This pathway thus constitutes a short-cut in the estuarine food chain...|$|R
