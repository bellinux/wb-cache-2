25|$|Later, Schwartz and Kroll used cognate and <b>homograph</b> as target words {{presented}} in low- and high-constraint sentences to Spanish-English bilinguals. They investigated how word presentation and the semantic constraint modulated language lexical access in bilinguals. Schwartz and Kroll used rapid serial visual presentation {{and the target}} word had to be named. No <b>homograph</b> effects were found, but less proficient bilinguals made more naming errors, especially in low-constraint sentences. They observed cognate facilitation (nonselective bilingual lexical access) in low-constraint sentences, but not in high-constraint ones. The {{results suggest that the}} semantic constraint of a sentence may restrict cross-lingual activation effects. Similar results on cognate effects were obtained by van Hell and de Groot in their study of Dutch-English bilinguals in an L2 lexical decision task and a translation task in forward (from L1 to L2) and in backward direction (from L2 to L1). Libben and Titone used eye tracking methodology and found that the cognate facilitation in semantically constraint sentences only happened at early stages of comprehension and rapidly resolved at later stages of comprehension.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of interlingual <b>homographs</b> on lexical access in German-English bilinguals, when reading in their native language. Previous {{studies have found that}} interlingual <b>homographs</b> interfere with lexical access in bilinguals, and cause a longer reading time for the target words compared to controls. Also, some evidence has been found that reading in the non-native language can affect processing in the native language. Participants’ eye movements were measured whilst reading interlingual <b>homographs</b> and matched controls embedded in sentences. Results from previous studies were not replicated; {{there was no significant difference}} in reading time for interlingual <b>homographs</b> compared to matched controls.

50|$|Another studied {{considered}} how anxiety influenced which {{meaning of}} <b>homographs</b> was chosen. <b>Homographs</b> are words {{with at least}} two meanings.

2500|$|The {{question}} whether the presentation of words in a sentence context restricts lexical access to words of the target language only are most studied in bilinguals' second language (L2) processing. This sentence context effect might be an efficient strategy to speed up lexical search, because it reduces the number of lexical candidates. For example, Elston-Guttler et al. showed that cross-lingual activation is very sensitive {{to the influence of}} a sentence context and previous activation state of the two languages in a semantic priming study. In their study, German-English bilinguals were presented with relatively low-constraint sentences in which a <b>homograph</b> (e.g., The woman gave her friend a pretty GIFT; gift means poison in German) or a control word was presented at the end (e.g., The woman gave her friend a pretty SHELL). [...] "Constraint" [...] means {{the degree to which the}} sentence frame preceding the target word biased that word. The sentence was then replaced by a target word (poison) for lexical decision task. They found that only for participants who saw a German film prior to experiment and only in the first block of the experiment, participants could recognize the target faster after primed with the related <b>homograph</b> sentence than primed with the controlled sentence. This suggests that bilinguals can quickly [...] "zoom into" [...] the L2 processing situation even the L1 activation was boosted.|$|E

2500|$|In most early studies, {{researchers}} did {{not find}} clear RT differences between test items (interlexical homographs or cognates) and control items. For example, in Gerard and Scarborough’s word recognition research with English monolinguals and Spanish-English bilinguals, cognates, <b>homograph</b> non-cognates and nonhomographic control words were used. [...] The cognates and control words were either high frequency or low frequency in both English and Spanish. The homographic non-cognates were high frequency in English and low frequency in Spanish or vice versa. The results generally supported the language-selective hypothesis. [...] Even {{though there was a}} significant main effect of word type for the bilingual group, it was mainly caused by the slow response to homographic noncognates which were of low frequency in the target language but of high frequency in the non-target language. Finally, {{there was no significant difference}} in the reaction time between bilinguals and monolinguals, which suggested that the lexical access for bilinguals in this research was restricted to only one language.|$|E

40|$|In {{this essay}} I studied {{the variety of}} {{differences}} in meaning and usage between Sino-Japanese <b>homographs.</b> The purpose of the essay was to {{shed some light on}} what different types of Sino-Japanese <b>homographs</b> there are, as well as to figure out which one of these is the most common and which one seems the most difficult to understand for Japanese or Chinese native speakers. To achieve this goal, I studied the Chinese subtitles for two Japanese TV dramas and compared them with the Japanese subtitles, to find concrete examples of <b>homographs</b> used differently in various contexts. I then selected among the <b>homographs</b> I found a few for each of my pre-determined categories, based on previous works, and analysed them further using dictionaries as well as sentences extracted from the TV drama subtitles. I compared my findings with those of previous studies and found that I largely came to similar conclusions, for example that <b>homographs</b> that hardly share any common meaning in Japanese and Chinese seem the most difficult to learn, or that many <b>homographs</b> seem to have a broader scope of meaning in Chinese than they do in Japanese. The reason why this subject is an important one is because a higher awareness of <b>homographs</b> can be very conducive to properly learn Chinese as a Japanese speaker, or Japanese as a Chinese speaker. It is in many cases wishful thinking to believe that you can simply use kanji words in the same way in Chinese and in Japanese just because they are written the same. In reality they can be different in various ways, such as not being of the same word class in Japanese and Chinese, or being part of colloquial vocabulary in Chinese whereas in Japanese they would only be used in a formal context...|$|R

2500|$|In {{studies that}} {{investigate}} whether lexical candidates from different languages are activated selectively or non-selectively during bilingual lexical access, {{there are two}} basic types of stimuli used: interlingual <b>homographs</b> and cognates. Interlingual <b>homographs</b> are words from two languages that are identical in their orthography, but different in their meaning, or phonology. [...] For example, the English word room means cream in Dutch. Cognates are words from two languages which are identical (or very similar) in orthography and also have large overlap in their meaning. For example, the word film is cognate for English and Dutch. Researchers used those types of stimuli to investigate whether bilinguals process them {{in the same way as}} the matched control words which occur only in one language. If the reaction time (RT) of interlexical <b>homographs</b> is same as the controlled monolingual word, then it supports the language-selective access hypothesis. If RT is significantly different for interlexical <b>homographs</b> than for the controlled monolingual word, it supports the language-nonselective access hypothesis.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{normally}} the grave accent serves {{the purpose of}} differentiating <b>homographs</b> in French (là ~ la, où ~ ou, çà ~ ça, à ~ a, etc.), the circumflex, for historical reasons, has come to serve a similar role.
