40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{demonstrate}} how emergency department triage scale and thrombolysis indicator {{data can be}} used to document the impact of a substantial increase in resource allocation. METHODS: Descriptive study in an emergency department of an adult tertiary hospital in Perth, Australia during similar periods of the year both before and after a substantial increase in emergency department staff, equipment, and system resources. The study group comprised a total of 11, 048 emergency department attendances and all cases of emergency department initiated thrombolysis or acute angioplasty. Outcome was measured using numbers seen and percentage seen within <b>indicator</b> <b>threshold</b> time together with admission rates in each of the five triage categories as well as by using time from presentation to initiation of reperfusion treatment in acute myocardial infarction. RESULTS: The proportion of patients seen within the prescribed indicator time increased by 16. 4 % (95 % confidence interval 14. 4 % to 18. 2 %). The increase was most pronounced in triage category 2 (32. 7 %). Median time to thrombolysis fell by 30 minutes to 37 minutes (p = 0. 0002).

Methods: Secondary analyses were performed on data from 1017 patients in seven Dutch hospitals. Data were collected using standardised forms for patients discharged in 2012. Comparability was assessed as the number of occasions the <b>indicator</b> <b>threshold</b> was reached for each hospital. Results: Hospitals recorded different time points based on different interpretations of the definitions. This led to substantial differences in indicator scores, ranging from 57 to 100 [*]% of the indictor threshold being reached. Some hospitals recorded all the required data elements for calculating the performance indicators but none of the data elements could be retrieved in a fully automated way. Moreover, recording accessibility and completeness of time points varied widely within and between hospitals. Conclusion: Hospitals use different definitions for treatment delay and vary greatly in the extent to which the necessary data are available, accessible and complete, impeding comparability between hospitals. Indicator developers, users and hospitals providing data should be aware of these issues and aim to improve data quality in order to facilitate comparability of performance indicators.

40|$|Frameworks to {{evaluate}} the sustainability of cropping systems in developing countries are scarce. This study proposes a framework to select easily quantifiable indicators {{that can be used}} to assess and communicate the sustainability of cropping systems in developing countries. The widely accepted social, economic and environmental dimensions of sustainability were covered using predefined criteria from which the indicators were then drawn. An initial list of indicators was established based on literature review and expert opinion, and through filtering reduced to 16 core indicators. Using the case of Irish potatobased cropping systems, a grower survey was conducted to collect data on production practices in four different cropping systems. The survey data were then used to calculate the sustainability indicators expressed as resource use efficiencies based on actual potato yields. The survey data also served as input into the Cool Farm Tool - Potato model to estimate greenhouse gas emissions from farm operations involved in potato production. With the help of local agricultural extension officers, focus group discussions were held with farmers of each production system to decide on sustainable and unsustainable <b>indicator</b> <b>threshold</b> levels.

However, the qualities and {{the characteristics of the}} already existing indicators vary substantially. Due to both scientific and societal aspects, so will the future indicators.

The TITAN function uses a novel technique combining indicator species analysis, change point analysis (Qian et al. 2003), and randomization procedures to detect how taxa change in distribution (cover, abundance, or frequency) along a gradient, as well as to detect possible community thresholds across that gradient. A community threshold represents synchronous response of multiple taxa to the same gradient value; in this case, it would be synchronous response of life form groups to fire severity. Briefly, TITAN converts indicator values to Z scores, and then sums all the z scores for each point along a gradient in which a given taxa is present or absent. The highest sum (Z) score of present taxa is evidence of a positive threshold, and the highest sum (Z) score for absent taxa is evidence for a negative threshold (Baker and King 2010). The TITAN function also gives two values, purity and reliability, that evaluate the confidence surrounding the indicator value estimates. Purity is the proportion of 500 bootstrap replicates with the same response direction (positive or negative). Reliability is the proportion of 500 bootstrap replicates with P values ≤ 0.05. Life form groups that have high purity (> 0.90) have high fidelity to a given response direction, and those with high reliability (> 0.90) have strong statistical confidence.|$|E

Bacteroidales host-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to quantify fecal bacteria in water and provide insights into contributing host fecal sources. Over 140 surface water samples from 10 major rivers and estuaries within the Monterey Bay region were tested over 14 months with four Bacteroidales-specific assays (universal, human, dog, and cow), three FIB (total coliforms, fecal coliforms, and enterococci), two protozoal pathogens (Cryptosporidium and Giardia spp.), and four bacterial pathogens (Campylobacter spp., Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, Salmonella spp., and Vibrio spp.).

Vibrio cholerae was detected most frequently, followed by Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Salmonella, and Campylobacter spp. Bayesian conditional probability {{analysis was used to}} characterize the Bacteroidales performance assays, and the ratios of concentrations determined using host-specific and universal assays were used to show that fecal contamination from human sources was more common than livestock or dog sources in coastal study sites.

40|$|The {{frequency}} of poor-water-quality advisories issued in Milwaukee and Racine, Wisconsin, {{in the absence}} of identifiable sources of contamination brought into question the reliability of the present indicator organism, Escherichia coli. Enteroccoci have been suggested as an alternative to E. coli for freshwater monitoring due to their direct correlation to swimmer-associated gastroenteritis. The purpose of this research was threefold: (i) to explore enterococci as an alternative to E. coli for monitoring freshwater Lake Michigan beaches, (ii) to evaluate the impact of the two indicators on regulatory decisions, and (iii) to compare membrane filtration m-enterococcus agar with indoxyl-β-d-glucoside to a chemical substrate technique (Enterolert) for the recovery of enterococci. Recreational water samples from Milwaukee (n = 305) and Racine (n = 153) were analyzed for the enumeration of E. coli and enterococci using IDEXX Colilert- 18 and Enterolert. Correlation between the indicators was low (R 2 = 0. 60 and 0. 69). Based on U. S.

A comparison of the two enterococcal methods (n = 124) yielded similar results (R 2 = 0. 62). This was further confounded by the frequent inability to verify enterococci from those wells producing fluorescence by the defined substrate test using conventional microbiological methods.

Targeted selective treatments (TST) may achieve this through the treatment only of individuals {{that would benefit}} most from anthelmintic, according to certain criteria. However TST consequences on cattle are uncertain, mainly due to difficulties of comparison between alternative strategies. We developed a mathematical model to compare: 1) the most ‘beneficial’ indicator for treatment selection and 2) the method of selection of calves exposed to Ostertagia ostertagi, i. e. treating a fixed {{percentage of the population}} with the lowest (or highest) indicator values versus treating individuals who exceed (or are below) a given <b>indicator</b> <b>threshold.</b> The indicators evaluated were average daily gain (ADG), faecal egg counts (FEC), plasma pepsinogen, combined FEC and plasma pepsinogen, versus random selection of individuals. Treatment success was assessed in terms of benefit per R (BPR), the ratio of average benefit in weight gain to change in frequency of resistance alleles R (relative to an untreated population). The optimal indicator in terms of BPR for fixed percentages of calves treated was plasma pepsinogen and the worst ADG; in the latter case treatment was applied to some individuals who were not in need of treatment. The reverse was found when calves were treated according to threshold criteria, with ADG being the best target indicator for treatment. This was also the most beneficial strategy overall, with a significantly higher BPR value than any other strategy, but its degree of success depended on the chosen threshold of the indicator. The study shows strong support for TST, with all strategies showing improvements on calves treated selectively, compared with whole-herd treatment at 3, 8, 13 weeks post-turnout.

40|$|Regional and {{national}} yield predictions are generally {{based on a}} combination of expert knowledge, survey data, and model simulations. Predictions can influence crop prices and are used to estimate end-of-season stocks. In Europe, national yield predictions are made available to stakeholders several times during the growing season in the monthly MARS bulletin. Predictions are made with the MARS crop yield forecasting system, which relies on an in-depth analysis of past climate and crop statistics, short-term weather forecasts, and crop growth simulations. The skills and limitations of these products are important because they inform EU trade policies. The prediction of extreme yield losses is of particular interest because extreme events can significantly influence the quantity of tradable commodities. In this study, we evaluate the capacity of a large range of indicators to predict the occurrence of extreme yield loss events. Indicators of various complexity levels are considered: simple or combined climate variables, agro-climatic variables and outputs of complex dynamic crop models. Each indicator is used to predict the occurrence of extreme yield loss in France and Spain for both wheat and grain maize. The sensitivity and specificity of the indicators are evaluated by ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) analysis using de-trended regional yield time series. Indicators are ranked based on a score quantifying their ability to separate extreme from non-extreme yield loss events. No single indicator performs systematically well but several show acceptable scores. There is no obvious relationship between the level of complexity of a given indicator and its accuracy. Maximum temperatures and, later in the growing season, potential yield simulations rank highest for both crop species in France. Drought indices perform well in Spain for wheat and maize. The robustness of our ranking is evaluated by comparing the results obtained using several alternative methods. We argue that this transparent framework can be useful to evaluate and improve crop monitoring systems worldwide. In this perspective we provide a relation linking the most accurate <b>indicator</b> <b>threshold</b> values to the probability of extreme yield loss. JRC. D. 5 -Food Securit...|$|E
40|$|The {{sustainability}} of agricultural production {{is linked to}} the environment from which it draws its resources. Potato production in the Sandveld in the South African Western Cape occurs in the Cape Floral Kingdom: a vulnerable and globally significant biodiversity hotspot. A scientific approach defining and monitoring sustainability criteria and indicators is required to improve the {{sustainability of}} potato production in such a sensitive area. In this paper we propose principles related to the ecological impact of potato production (nature preservation, water preservation and the minimization of chemical and carbon-dioxide emissions) and their derived criteria related to land clearing, irrigation, emissions, and others. Next we defined calculable and measurable indicators of the efficiency with which resources are used, such as proportion of land cleared, water use by the crop, amount of biocides used, the embodied energy of biocides, and the energy needed for farming operations versus the potato yields obtained. In-depth interviews were held with 14 farmers representing 20 % of the total potato production area to obtain the current values of these indicators. These were compared to model outcomes of two main sustainability indicators: land and water use efficiency. The land use efficiency varied least between growers, from (36 to 58  Mg (tonnes) ha- 1), water use efficiency returned values between 3 and 9  g potato l- 1 water, while chemical fertilizer phosphorus use efficiency varied most at 98 and 995  g potato g- 1 P applied. Model outcomes confirmed some of the trends revealed by the survey, e. g. growing potatoes in winter and growing them with less than optimal water offers possibilities to double water use efficiency. Ways to derive <b>indicator</b> <b>threshold</b> norms are proposed based on the knowledge of physical and biological processes determining resource availability, the observed variation among farmers and the model outcomes.

40|$|Abstract The {{regression}} coefficient estimates from {{ordinary least squares}} (OLS) have a low probability of being close to the real value {{when there is a}} multicollinearity problem in the design matrix. In order to combat this problem, many regularized methods have been introduced. ^ Principal components regression (PCR) is an important analysis tool for dealing with multicollinearity and high-dimensionality. In conventional PCR, {{the first step is to}} change the original predictors to orthogonal principal components (PC 2 ̆ 7 s) by a linear transformation. These PC 2 ̆ 7 s correspond to the eigenvalues which are sorted in a decreasing order. The next step is to regress the response on a number of the PC 2 ̆ 7 s and to compute the model selection criteria such as AIC, BIC, GCV for each model. The final step is to compare the criteria values and choose the model corresponding to the smallest value. However, the traditional way of doing PCR is quite computationally inefficient. Thus, we proposed three competitive models to overcome this problem. In these proposed methods, the number of PC 2 ̆ 7 s can be automatically determined. The main idea involves approximation of the <b>indicator</b> <b>threshold</b> function with a smooth sigmoid surrogate function, yet in several different ways. ^ In our first model PTPCR, we used the logistic function with a large fixed shape parameter and an undetermined threshold parameter to replace the indicate function. Then the selection criterion can be treated as an objective function for optimization to estimate the threshold parameter. The PC 2 ̆ 7 s to be included in the final model can be obtained by selecting those with eigenvalues greater than the estimated threshold parameter. This reformulation facilitates direct estimation of the best number of PC 2 ̆ 7 s, leading to much improved computational efficiency. ^ Apart from the PTPCR, we proposed another two models: PTPCR-V 1 and PTPCR-V 2. In PTPCR-V 1, we free the shape parameter in the logistic function. Then we optimized the criterion function with respect to both shape and threshold parameters. PTPCR-V 2 is fit in a similar manner to PTPCR, except for that the preference order of PC 2 ̆ 7 s is now based on the {{regression coefficient}}s in the PTPCR-V 2. ^ On the basis of extensive simulation studies, all our three proposed models perform better than PCR. More specically, PTPCR yields a similar predictive performance to PCR yet with a shorter computing time, while PTPCR-V 1 and PTPCR-V 2 outperform PCR not only in terms of computational efficiency, but also in prediction accuracy. ...|$|E

40|$|Drought {{monitoring}} and early warning {{is an important}} measure to enhance resilience towards drought. While there are numerous operational systems using different drought indicators, {{there is no consensus}} on which indicator best represents drought impact occurrence for any given sector. Furthermore, thresholds are widely applied in these indicators but, to date, little empirical evidence exists as to which <b>indicator</b> <b>thresholds</b> trigger impacts on society, the economy, and ecosystems. The main obstacle for evaluating commonly used drought indicators is a lack of information on drought impacts. Our aim was therefore to exploit text-based data from the European Drought Impact report Inventory (EDII) to identify indicators that are meaningful for region-, sector-, and season-specific impact occurrence, and to empirically determine <b>indicator</b> <b>thresholds.</b> In addition, we tested the predictability of impact occurrence based on the best-performing indicators. To achieve these aims we applied a correlation analysis and an ensemble regression tree approach, using Germany and the UK (the most data-rich countries in the EDII) as test beds. As candidate indicators we chose two meteorological indicators (Standardized Precipitation Index, SPI, and Standardized Precipitation Evaporation Index, SPEI) and two hydrological indicators (streamflow and groundwater level percentiles). The analysis revealed that accumulation periods of SPI and SPEI best linked to impact occurrence are longer for the UK compared with Germany, but there is variability within each country, among impact categories and, to some degree, seasons. The median of regression tree splitting values, which we regard as estimates of thresholds of impact occurrence, was around − 1 for SPI and SPEI in the UK; distinct differences between northern/northeastern vs. southern/central regions were found for Germany. Predictions with the ensemble regression tree approach yielded reasonable results for regions with good impact data coverage. The predictions also provided insights into the EDII, in particular highlighting drought events where missing impact reports may reflect a lack of recording rather than true absence of impacts. Overall, the presented quantitative framework proved to be a useful tool for evaluating drought indicators, and to model impact occurrence. In summary, this study demonstrates the information gain for drought {{monitoring and}} early warning through impact data collection and analysis. It highlights the important role that quantitative analysis with impact data can have in providing "ground truth" for drought indicators, alongside more traditional stakeholder-led approaches...|$|R
40|$|The {{magnitude}} of current nutrient losses from agriculture to ground and surface water calls for effective environmental policy, {{including the use}} of regulation. Nutrient loss is experienced in many countries despite differences in the organisation and intensity of agricultural production. However, at present there is no internationally agreed practice to assess the effectiveness of different kinds of regulatory practice and compliance level, or to make effective comparisons. There is a wide variety of indicators available for this purpose, ranging from livestock density and input-output balances to nutrient concentrations in soil and water.

Unfortunately, there {{does not seem to be}} a single indicator that is effective, comprehensive, efficient, responsive and attributable at the same time.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focused on}} building a model based on collection of experimental data acquired with high electrical stressors {{at the gate}} of the power MOSFET under an isothermal condition to analyze certain deviations of intrinsic properties leading to degradation. The primary <b>indicators</b> were <b>threshold</b> shift, deviation in switching characteristics, and significant expansion of the Miller Plateau due to accelerated stressing of the device from the pristine condition. The intrinsic mechanism associated with the threshold shift and changes in the parasitic capacitances were observed and analyzed with mathematical precision and device parameter simulation. It was seen that, in addition to altered switching behavior and other changes, the threshold voltage shifted by 172...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{diagnostic}} approach {{based on}} multi-scale integrated analysis and model simulations {{was employed to}} identify specific or common biophysical constraints, technological changes and ecological compatibilities of the diverse subsistence (SUB) and organic (ORG) agro-ecosystems in the Fertile Crescent (FC) of West Asia and the organic and conventional (CNV) agro-ecosystem in the Northern Corn Belt (NCB) and Northern Great Plains (NGP) of the U. S. For each agro-ecosystem, soil carbon, total yield, temporal yield variance and yield coefficient of variation per crop rotation were used as sustainability <b>indicators.</b> <b>Thresholds</b> of technologies necessary for the proper functioning and flow of agro-ecosystem services were identified under the most-likely IPCC-projected climate change scenarios for the next 30 years. The carbon budgets of agro-ecosystems were largely related to the choice of crops, crop sequence, and length of the crop rotation, and were influenced by external inputs, tillage system and removal of crop residues. Carbon depletion {{is expected to be}} less in organic and subsistence agro-ecosystems when nitrogen-fixing legumes are included in more diverse crop rotations and when crop residues are incorporated into the soil. Potential nutrients loss to the environment was significantly larger in conventional systems, and nutrients are expected to be depleted over time in subsistence- faster than in organically-managed soils. Optimal and sustainable agricultural intensification is feasible through agroecosystem diversification and the proper integration of genetic and natural resources management. In all agroecosystems, for more diverse rotations to be adopted at a large scale, there needs to be large and easily accessible markets for the additional product...|$|R
40|$|To {{undertake}} exploratory benchmarking {{of a set}} {{of clinical}} indicators of quality care in residential care in Australia, data were collected from 107 residents within four medium-sized facilities (40 – 80 beds) in Brisbane, Australia. The proportion of residents in each sample facility with a particular clinical problem was compared with US Minimum Data Set quality <b>indicator</b> <b>thresholds.</b> Results demonstrated variability within and between clinical indicators, suggesting breadth of assessment using various clinical indicators of quality is an important factor when monitoring quality of care. More comprehensive and objective measures of quality of care would be of great assistance in determining and monitoring the effectiveness of residential aged care provision in Australia, particularly as demands for accountability by consumers and their families increase. What is known about the topic? The key to quality improvement is effective quality assessment, and one means of evaluating quality of care is through clinical outcomes. The Minimum Data Set quality indicators have been credited with improving quality in United States nursing homes. What does this paper add? The Clinical Care Indicators Tool was used to collect data on clinical outcomes, enabling comparison of data from a small Australian sample with American quality benchmarks to illustrate the utility of providing guidelines for interpretation. What are the implications for practitioners? Collecting and comparing clinical outcome data would enable practitioners to better understand the quality of care being provided and whether practices required review. The Clinical Care Indicator Tool could provide a comprehensive and systematic means of doing this, thus filling a gap in quality monitoring within Australian residential aged care...|$|R
50|$|It was {{proposed}} by Eddy and Leimbach in 1953. They used a behavioral model of nociception where {{behaviors such as}} jumping and hind paw-licking are elicited following a noxious thermal stimulus. Licking is a rapid response to painful thermal stimuli that is a direct <b>indicator</b> of nociceptive <b>threshold.</b> Jumping represents a more elaborated response, with a latency, and encompasses an emotional component of escaping.|$|R

The present study attempts to analyze and evaluate the amount and distribution of the existing urban green space and the requirements of those green areas by the public. The green infrastructure of the city of Faro was evaluated with three methods: landscape assessment using modules, spatial assessment using GIS and social assessment using an urban population survey. This research provided <b>indicators</b> and <b>thresholds</b> to be included by policy makers in local regulations about green infrastructure of the city of Faro...|$|R
