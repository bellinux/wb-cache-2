5|$|Since all {{isotopes}} of neptunium have half-lives {{that are}} many times {{shorter than the}} age of the Earth, any primordial neptunium should have decayed by now. After only about 80 million years, the concentration of even the longest lived isotope, 237Np, would have been reduced to less than one-trillionth (10−12) of its original amount; and even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> Earth had initially been made of pure 237Np (and ignoring that this would be well over its critical mass of 60kg), 2100 half-lives would have passed since the formation of the Solar System, and thus all of it would have decayed. Thus neptunium is present in nature only in negligible amounts produced as intermediate decay products of other isotopes.|$|E
5|$|The film {{references}} Resident Evil, {{with the}} crash site of the helicopter being located in the Arklay Forest near the Arklay Mountains, where the Resident Evil series began. Other similarities include Jill's moves from the first game. The recording of Terri's death is similar to Kenneth's death. A white goddess statue {{can be seen in}} the church, with artwork of goddesses having a large role in the puzzles of the Resident Evil series. Whilst walking on the Arklay Overpass, Jill speculates that there is no way out, and that Ashford may just be watching them on the cameras, as <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> thing were some sort of sick game. The games use a fixed camera perspective, which in most of the earlier games resembles a mounted camera's perspective. Another similarity includes a scene where Jill finds a gun under a pew, mirroring the game when the player finds ammunition or weapons in certain areas.|$|E

25|$|Another common {{application}} of case-hardening is on screws, particularly self-drilling screws. In {{order for the}} screws {{to be able to}} drill, cut and tap into other materials like steel, the drill point and the forming threads must be harder than the material(s) that it is drilling into. However, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> screw is uniformly hard, it will become very brittle and it will break easily. This is overcome by ensuring that only the case is hardened and the core remains relatively soft. For screws and fasteners, case-hardening is achieved by a simple heat treatment consisting of heating and then quenching.|$|E
25|$|Their predicament {{began on}} June 9, 1976, {{the day of}} her twenty-sixth birthday. The day before, she and Kevin had moved into a house a few miles away from their old {{apartment}} in Los Angeles. While unpacking, Dana suddenly becomes dizzy, and her surroundings begin to fade away. When she comes to her senses, she finds herself {{at the edge of a}} wood, near a river where a small, red-haired boy is drowning. Dana wades in after him, drags him to the shore, and tries to resuscitate him. The boy's mother, who had been unable to save him, begins screaming and hitting Dana, accusing her of killing her son, whom she identifies as Rufus. A man arrives and points a gun at Dana, terrifying her. She becomes dizzy again and arrives back at her new house with Kevin beside her. Kevin, shocked at her disappearance and reappearance, tries to understand <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> episode was real or a hallucination.|$|E
25|$|Milne {{toured the}} Caucasus in early 1919 and thought “the {{country and the}} {{inhabitants}} are equally loathsome” and that British withdrawal “would probably lead to anarchy” but “the world would (not) lose much <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of the country cut each other’s throats. They are certainly not worth {{the life of a}} single British soldier”. At the end of August 1919 the British withdrew from Baku (the small British naval presence was also withdrawn from the Caspian Sea), leaving only 3 battalions at Batum. Lord Curzon, Foreign Secretary, wanted a British presence in the region, although to Curzon’s fury (he thought it “abuse of authority”) the CIGS Henry Wilson gave Milne permission to withdraw if he deemed it necessary. After a British garrison at Enzeli (on the Persian Caspian coast) was taken prisoner by Bolshevik forces on 19 May 1920, Lloyd George finally insisted on a withdrawal from Batum early in June 1920. Financial retrenchment forced a British withdrawal from Persia in the spring of 1921.|$|E

25|$|However, Castle's unique {{idea for}} the game {{somewhat}} side-stepped the potential legal problems. He didn't want to adapt the film; {{he wanted to make}} an original game set within the film's milieu. This would mean the game would not have to borrow as heavily from the film as it would were it a straight adaptation, hence avoiding the potential legal problems down the road. Virgin loved Castle's idea, and asked him to make a pitch to Bud Yorkin. Castle built a demo for the pitch, but rather than using footage from the film, he and his team created a rough opening cutscene based on the film's aesthetic style, but without recreating any exact scenes. According to Castle, going into the pitch, Yorkin was concerned about how much footage from the film would be needed for the game, but when he saw the demo, he was thrilled, and asked Castle <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> game could be made in a similar manner. From that point forward, the development team had one overriding mandate; every scene in the game would be generated from scratch in 3D; no footage from the film would be used.|$|E
25|$|Under {{automatic}} operation, the on-train computer instructs {{the train}} what to do. The underlying {{protection and control}} system is called TBTC, which stands for Transmission-Based Train Control. The computer does everything except opening and closing the doors, starting the train at every station, mending faults and dealing with passengers. If ATO fails but TBTC is still operational, the trains can still be manually driven at line speed under PM (Protected Manual) conditions. Due {{to the fact that}} the train receives lots of updates in a short time, it is considered impossible for the driver to drive in this mode in regular service, and the train will be taken out of service and moved off the line as quickly as possible. If TBTC fails on an individual train then it would be put into Restricted Manual mode, which means that the train operator can drive the train at 5–10mph (8–16km/h) to the next station, where the train would be taken out of service until the fault is mended by technicians. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> TBTC system fails the line can still operate at a top speed of 16km/h using an auxiliary signal and track circuit system. The signals and track circuits only activate when the TBTC system has failed, and are normally dark.|$|E

500|$|Many of the {{locations}} in the episode were created from scratch, either through conventional means or through computer technology. The gas station, {{which could not be}} rented, was created by building a store {{on the side of the}} road on the outskirts of Lancaster and fitting it with gas pumps from a station that had recently gone out of business. The store was then loaded with merchandise obtained from restaurant supply houses and cooperative food manufactures. The last scene filmed was of the station exploding. After filming ceased, the station was demolished and the road returned to its previous state. Duke Tomasick, The X-Files construction coordinator, later said that, [...] "it was <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> thing never even existed". Area 51, the government airplanes, and the alien craft were constructed by visual effects producer Bill Millar on a Macintosh computer.
