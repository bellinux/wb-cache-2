5|$|The second season, {{along with}} its ongoing {{examination}} of the <b>drug</b> <b>problem</b> {{and its effect on}} the urban poor, examines the plight of the blue-collar urban working class as exemplified by stevedores in the city port, as some of them get caught up in smuggling drugs and other contraband inside the shipping containers that pass through their port. In a season-long subplot, the Barksdale organization continues its drug trafficking despite Avon's imprisonment, with Stringer Bell assuming greater power.|$|E
5|$|In January 1956 Hope {{recorded}} with another rising star, Jackie McLean, for the saxophonist's Lights Out! In April {{of the same}} year Hope should have appeared on saxophonist Gene Ammons' The Happy Blues, but he left the record company's building before the session began and did not return. Hope claimed that he had gone to visit an aunt in hospital, but his absence was attributed by others to his heroin addiction. This had existed on and off for several years, and had led to at least one spell in prison. His <b>drug</b> <b>problem</b> and associated criminal record led to the withdrawal of Hope's New York City Cabaret Card around 1956, so he was no longer permitted to play in clubs in the city.|$|E

25|$|The major drugs {{of choice}} are {{injectable}} heroin, morphine, smokeable opium, crystal methamphetamine, nimetazepam, temazepam, and MDMA. Preferences between opium and heroin/morphine, {{and methods of}} administration, differ from region to region within China. The use of heroin and opium has increased among the younger population, as income has grown and the youth have more free time. China considers crystal methamphetamine abuse second to heroin/morphine as a major <b>drug</b> <b>problem.</b> The use of MDMA has only recently become popular in China's growing urban areas.|$|E
25|$|Incidents {{of police}} {{brutality}} in Austria seem to be largely influenced and triggered by racism and prejudice against foreign nationals and ethnic minorities within the community.

For example, in Vienna there tends to be an association made between Vienna's <b>drug</b> <b>problem</b> and the city's African migrants. This {{has led to the}} existence of negative cultural stereotypes which have then led to the racial profiling of African migrants, due to the negative associations with their ethnicity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Drug use is {{believed}} to be an important factor contributing to the poor health and increased mortality risk that has been widely observed among homeless individuals. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the prevalence and characteristics of drug use among a representative sample of homeless individuals and to examine the association between <b>drug</b> <b>problems</b> and physical and mental health status. Methods Recruitment of 603 single men, 304 single women, and 284 adults with dependent children occurred at homeless shelters and meal programs in Toronto, Canada. Information was collected on demographic characteristics and patterns of drug use. The Addiction Severity Index was used to assess whether participants suffered from <b>drug</b> <b>problems.</b> Associations of <b>drug</b> <b>problems</b> with physical and mental health status (measured by the SF- 12 scale) were examined using regression analyses. Results Forty percent of the study sample had <b>drug</b> <b>problems</b> in the last 30 days. These individuals were more likely to be single men and less educated than those without <b>drug</b> <b>problems.</b> They were also more likely to have become homeless at a younger age (mean 24. 8 vs. 30. 9 years) and for a longer duration (mean 4. 8 vs. 2. 9 years). Marijuana and cocaine were the most frequently used drugs in the past two years (40 % and 27 %, respectively). <b>Drug</b> <b>problems</b> within the last 30 days were associated with significantly poorer mental health status (- 4. 9 points, 95 % CI - 6. 5 to - 3. 2) but not with poorer physical health status (- 0. 03 points, 95 % CI - 1. 3 to 1. 3)). Conclusions Drug use is common among homeless individuals in Toronto. Current <b>drug</b> <b>problems</b> are associated with poorer mental health status but not with poorer physical health status. </p...|$|R

25|$|In the United States, zero tolerance, as an {{approach}} against drugs, was originally {{designed as a}} part of the War on Drugs under Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, ostensibly to curb the transfer of drugs at US borders. Law-enforcement was to target the drug users rather than the transporters or suppliers under the assumptions that harsh sentences and strict enforcement of personal use would reduce demand and, therefore, strike at root cause of the <b>drug</b> <b>problem.</b> The policy did not require additional laws; instead existing law was enacted with less leniency. Similar concepts in other countries, such as Sweden, Italy, Japan, Singapore China, India, and Russia have since been labeled zero tolerance.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, {{without a}} record deal, the Stooges kept {{performing}} in small clubs with a 5-piece line-up that included both Ron Asheton and James Williamson on guitars and Jimmy Recca on bass, Dave Alexander having been sacked by Pop {{the previous year}} when he turned up for a gig unable to play because of his chronic alcoholism (he died in 1975). That year Pop and David Bowie met at Max's Kansas City, a nightclub and restaurant in New York City. Pop's career received a boost from his relationship with Bowie when Bowie decided in 1972 to produce an album with Pop in England. With James Williamson signed on as guitarist, the search began for a rhythm section. However, since neither Pop nor Williamson were satisfied with any players in England, they decided to re-unite the Stooges. Ron Asheton grudgingly moved from guitar to bass. The recording sessions produced the rock landmark Raw Power. After its release Scott Thurston {{was added to the}} band on keyboards/electric piano and Bowie continued his support, but Pop's <b>drug</b> <b>problem</b> persisted. The Stooges' last show in 1974 ended in a fight between the band and a group of bikers, documented on the album Metallic K.O. Drug abuse stalled his career again for several years.|$|E

40|$|The {{role of the}} family- and family-based interventions- in {{responding}} to <b>drug</b> <b>problems</b> {{has been the subject}} of research internationally. This report focuses on family support services (FSS) in their role of strengthening families to act as a buffer to <b>drug</b> <b>problems.</b> It aims to ascertain the extent to which current services explicitly identify <b>drug</b> <b>problems</b> as a target of their general activities and the extent to which family support work may be judged to play a positive role in the prevention of <b>drug</b> <b>problems</b> and the potential for expanding the scope of family support as to enhance its capacity regarding drug prevention. The research included a literature review on family support and a survey based on 461 self-completed questionnaires, which represented a 26 % return of surveyed services. The survey found that only one-fifth of FSS stated that drugs were a major focus of their work. The study suggest that the remaining FSS have considerable potential to provide drug prevention in their work. The study concludes that the major areas identified that FSS could play a greater role {{in responding}} to <b>drug</b> <b>problems</b> are: new programmes/ initiatives, resources, promotion, coordination and integration, training and mainstreaming of drug prevention in family support work...|$|R
25|$|Official Chinese {{resistance}} to opium was renewed on September 20, 1906, with an antiopium initiative intended {{to eliminate the}} <b>drug</b> <b>problem</b> within 10 years. The program relied on the turning of public sentiment against opium, with mass meetings at which opium paraphernalia were publicly burned, as well as coercive legal action and the granting of police powers to {{organizations such as the}} Fujian Anti-Opium Society. Smokers were required to register for licenses for gradually reducing rations of the drug. Action against opium farmers centred upon a highly repressive incarnation of law enforcement in which rural populations had their property destroyed, their land confiscated and/or were publicly tortured, humiliated and executed. Addicts sometimes turned to missionaries for treatment for their addiction, though many associated these foreigners with the drug trade. The program was counted as a substantial success, with a cessation of direct British opium exports to China (but not Hong Kong) and most provinces declared free of opium production. Nonetheless, the success of the program was only temporary, with opium use rapidly increasing during the disorder following the death of Yuan Shikai in 1916. Opium farming also increased, peaking in 1930 when the League of Nations singled China out as the primary source of illicit opium in East and Southeast Asia. Many local powerholders facilitated the trade during this period to finance conflicts over territory and political campaigns. In some areas food crops were eradicated to make way for opium, contributing to famines in Kweichow and Shensi Provinces between 1921 and 1923, and food deficits in other provinces.|$|E
