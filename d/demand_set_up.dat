It requires reliable packet transmission, but rapid topology changing and frequent disconnection makes it difficult to design an efficient routing protocol. To disseminate the warning messages among vehicles to avoid accidents are sometimes a mission critical problem at some level. Therefore, this paper proposes a scheme that avoids the delay of communication that occurs due to frequent disconnection in routing. For this, the meta heuristic search i. e. ant colony optimization is combined with AODV and route repair strategy is applied to ACO...|$|E

On <b>demand</b> <b>set</b> <b>up,</b> fault tolerance and unconstrained connectivity are a couple of advantages that why mobile computing continues to enjoy rapid growth. However, it can be expected that security attacks are likely to increase in the coming future due to the more and more wirelss applications being developed and deployed on to the well-known expose nature of wireless medium. Thanks to the substantial research efforts carried out by the community so far, we make the following contribution in this paper. In this paper we are specifically taking real life application of mobile ad-hoc networks i. e. VANET (vehicular adhoc networks). We will present a novel infrastructure for vehicle communication on highway and propose some potential security challenges from a driver’s perspective and car manufacturer’s. We will introduce an exemplary approach to outline various challenges and some possible solution...|$|E
40|$|In {{the growth}} context, this paper {{concentrates}} on the supply-demand determination of regional equilibrium incomes in regional goods markets {{as a framework for}} discussing the implications of competition among regions. Prices at the regional and national level are fixed so that all variables are of real magnitudes; there are no money markets. Regional factor stocks (private and public capital, labor force in the form of human capital) and regional <b>demand</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> the barriers to economic growth (cf. generally Barro, Sala-i-Martin (1995)). The analysis is restricted to two regions embedded in the State. The supply side of the model is represented by different regional production function is which generate regional factor demand. Demand-side determination of equilibrium regional incomes arises from the definitions of national accounting enriched by basic behavioral relationships. Substantial consideration is given to the equalization of regional supply and demand in diverging cases (e. g., excess demand in one of the two regions). Changes in factor stocks (differential equations) maintain the dynamics of the model. Regional competition is expressed by variations of regional and state parameters. Their numerical influences on growth will be dealt with in Bobzin (2000) ...|$|E

The snails' picker supplier has the lowest part of the chain with only 4 %. However, the consumption of snails could increase at national level if solutions are found to the sociological and cultural constraints, notably food prejudices and forbidden.

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the increasing requirements on enterprises caused by globalization, fusion of business and IT, new/changing technologies and especially new regulations Enterprise Architecture Management has gained increasing public attention. In this context Enterprise Architecture (EA) can be considered as a holistic view of an enterprise acting as a "collaboration force" between business aspects such as goals, visions, strategies and governance principles as well as IT aspects. For EAs to be useful and to provide business value their formal and comprehensive documentation (data collection and visualization) is essential. Due to the increasing information amount caused by the extending scope on the business {{as well as on the}} IT side the EA modelling is cost-intensive and time-consuming. Most of all the documentation is impaired by increasing linking and integration as well as by the striving for automated cross-company business processes. Consequently, the relevant data are widely scattered. Current approaches are largely determined by manual processes which are able to deal only to a limited extent with the new trends. However, a lot of the needed information, above all about the application landscape and the interrelations, is already present in existing Enterprise Service Bus systems used to facilitate the collaboration between applications both within and beyond boundaries. This allows avoiding the expensive task of data collection. This thesis is concerned with the automated documentation of Enterprise Architectures and the support of decision-making using the information provided by an existing Enterprise Service Bus, whereby as a concrete system SAP NetWeaver Process Integration is used. Therefore a tool-aided automated process for the creation and visualization of an Enterprise Architecture model instance is proposed. An essential aspect in this connection is the coverage of the EA information <b>demand</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> by EA frameworks such as CySeMoL and ArchiMate, the analysis of the quality as well as the implementation of the logic to transform SAP PI data into EA information. Moreover, several viewpoints are proposed to visualize the extracted data appropriately especially regarding decision problems in the area of the collaboration between applications both within and beyond boundaries...|$|E

This dissertation contains three essays, {{each of which}} is pertinent to topics in empirical Industrial Organization. The second and third chapters are coauthored with Matthew H. Shapiro and Amil Petrin, respectively. In the first chapter, any empirical evidence presented in this chapter is derived based on data from the Nielsen Company (US), LLC and marketing databases provided by the Kilts Center for Marketing Data Center at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business. I quantify the consumer benefit of introducing one-stop shopping as a new shopping choice and estimates the benefit to firms in turn. Firm scope benefits consumers by allowing them to purchase multiple goods at one location like supercenters, malls, or department stores. I exploit an exogenous change in the allowable firm scope in Washington State, which recently deregulated the retail liquor industry to allow liquor sales in grocery stores. After deregulation, the number of liquor-selling stores is increased fourfold, and 75 % of the liquor shopping has been done by one-stop shopping with groceries. Moreover, the liquor quantity sold has increased despite the increased after-tax price of liquor, implying that the choice set of shopping trips has improved. To disentangle the value of one-stop shopping from the value of reduced shopping distance due to more liquor-selling stores, I build a structural demand model of choices for shopping trips. I use household panel and retailer sales data from both before and after deregulation and extend the standard method to allow for endogenous prices to the setting where a store can have two separate qualities of grocery and liquor sections. The estimated consumer benefit of one-stop shopping is $ 2. 52 per trip per household, which is 8 % of the household's expenditure on liquor. Selling liquor inside of a grocery store increases its grocery sales by 4. 5 %, and liquor sales are increased by 30 % compared to being sold outside of the grocery store. In the second chapter, we describe a model and estimation strategy to assess the efficacy of several US federal investment projects amounting to $ 130 million to build out the foundation of an plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging network and to encourage purchase of these vehicles. Using a new micro-level data set of electric vehicle purchases in California to estimate a rich discrete choice model of automobile demand, we analyze whether these charging stations have had {{a significant role in the}} adoption of electric vehicles in California over the past several years and weigh them against several other policy alternatives. In the last chapter, we suggest an alternative approach to identify demand and supply in discrete choice <b>demand</b> <b>set</b> <b>up.</b> A major contribution of Berry et al. (1995) (BLP) is to show how to transform the market shares in a non-linear discrete choice demand system into product-quality indices that are linear in price, product characteristics, and the demand error, so standard IV techniques can once again be used to estimate demand. They treat price as endogenous but assume that the product characteristics observed by the researcher are uncorrelated with the demand error, that is, the characteristics observed by consumers and producers but not by the researcher. As in Spence (1976) (e. g.) if firms set observed and unobserved characteristics at the same time then this assumption may not hold. We mimic BLP exactly but instead of using their mean independence assumption we learn about demand and supply by assuming firms are maximizing expected profits given their beliefs about preferences, costs, and competitors' actions when they choose observed and "unobserved" product characteristics. We allow firms' information sets at the time they choose characteristics to potentially include other firms' product characteristics, demand and cost shocks, signals on all of these, or no information at all on them in the setting of Hansen (1982). Ex-post firms may wish they had made different decisions and our identification is based on the assumption that firms are correct in their choices on average. Using the same automobile data from BLP, we find that some of the slightly puzzling parameter estimates of BLP go away as all of our parameter estimates are of the correct sign.   We find significantly more precise estimates given the same exact data equivalent to approximately a sixteen-fold increase in the number of observations. We strongly reject the standard identification assumption; the conditional correlations of the demand and cost unobservables with observed characteristics equal 0. 85 and 0. 7 respectively...|$|E

With increasing energy-prices and focus on global warming, the rules for building new houses is more focused on the buildings energy-efficiency. New concepts such as low-energy houses, passive houses, zero-energy houses and plus-energy houses are heard of both in marketing and discussions. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate and summarise the demands that are required for building a new house today in Sweden today. This report answers what the different new concepts of “low-energy houses” means. It also investigates a newly built typehouse by performing an energy-simulation. When doing this energy-simulation {{it has also been}} investigated what changes are needed for the typehouse to meet the demands to be classified as a passive house. The result shows that the definitions for different ”low-energy house”-concepts are straggling. It also shows that the demands on new buildings <b>set</b> <b>up</b> by the Swedish National Board of Housing, Building and Planning (Boverket) are relatively low compared to the more extensive demands required for a passive house.
