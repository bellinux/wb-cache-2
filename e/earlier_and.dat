Cross-lagged models provided evidence for bidirectionality between personality <b>and</b> identity in <b>early</b> <b>and</b> middle adolescence. Moreover, our results highlighted that {{the relationships between the}} facets-level personality and identity dimensions were more complex than the associations between the domain-level of personality and identity dimensions.

40|$|The Adriatic Carbonate Platform (AdCP), was a {{separate}} shallowmarine depositional system {{characterized by a}} lack of terrigenous input and was connected to Gondwana towards the South via Gavrovo–Tripolitza or Apulia. It existed for approximately 120 MY, from the Early Jurassic (Pliensbachian/Toarcian) {{to the end of the}} Cretaceous, resulting in a 4000 – 6500 m thick succession of almost pure carbonates. However, this is part of a thicker (> 8000 m) sequence of predominantly carbonate rocks which forms the Karst Dinarides, and was deposited during more than 270 MY – at least from the Carboniferous (Moscovian) to the Late Eocene. Among many different groups of fossil organisms, benthic foraminifera are especially abundant and well preserved, so they, along with calcareous algae (Dasycladales), are the most important fossils used for age determination and stratigraphic subdivision of shallowmarine carbonate deposits. Within the 257 determined taxa belonging to different foraminiferal families which lived through the Mesozoic, numerous different index fossils occur in assemblages indicating various ages: Early Triassic, Anisian, Carnian, Norian–Rhaetian, Late Sinemurian, <b>Early</b> <b>and</b> Late Pliensbachian (Carixian <b>and</b> Domerian), <b>Early</b> <b>and</b> Late Aalenian, <b>Early</b> <b>and</b> Late Bajocian, <b>Early</b> <b>and</b> Late Bathonian, Callovian, <b>Early</b> <b>and</b> Late Oxfordian, Kimmeridgian, Tithonian, Berriasian, Valanginian, Late Hauterivian, Late Barremian, <b>Early</b> <b>and</b> Late Aptian (Bedulian <b>and</b> Gargasian), <b>Early</b> <b>and</b> Late Albian, <b>Early,</b> Middle <b>and</b> Late Cenomanian, Turonian, Coniacian, Santonian, <b>Early</b> <b>and</b> Late Campanian <b>and</b> <b>Early</b> <b>and</b> Late Maastrichtian. A total of 64 biostratigraphic units – biozones of different categories, from subzone to superzone, were defined within the stratigraphic interval from the Carnian to the Late Maastrichtian. This enabled very detailed biostratigraphic subdivision of the carbonate deposits within the Karst Dinarides. This is one of the most precise sequences, not only in this area, but also among former shallow marine deposits of the entire Neotethyan realm in the present Mediterranean region. The palaeobiogeographic characteristics of biotopes and the composition of foraminiferal assemblages during the Mesozoic were controlled by the position of the study area within the Neotethyan bioprovinces. Until the Albian, this area represented part of the Southern Neotethyan bioprovince, while from the Cenomanian to its final disintegration at the end of the Cretaceous it belonged to {{a separate}}, Central Mediterranean Neotethyan bioprovince...|$|R

Consequently, some believe in {{the possibility that there}} were prehistoric humans in Sri Lanka from 500,000 BP or <b>earlier,</b> <b>and</b> consider it likely that they were on the island by 300,000 BP.
