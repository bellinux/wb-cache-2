Gate <b>drive</b> <b>card</b> for IGBTs and MOSFETs with basic features can be designed easily by making use of discrete electronic components. Gate driver ICs provides attractive features in a single package, which improves reliability and reduces effort of design engineers. Either case needs one or more isolated power supplies to drive each power semiconductor devices and provide isolation to the control circuitry from the power circuit. The primary emphasis is then to provide simplified and compact isolated power supplies to the gate <b>drive</b> <b>card</b> with the requisite isolation strength and which consumes less space, and for providing thermal protection to the power semiconductor modules for 3 -� 3 wire or 4 wire inverters...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a start up power circuit for a control power supply (CPS) which feeds power to the sub-systems of High Power Converters (HPC). The sub-systems such as gate <b>drive</b> <b>card,</b> annunciation card, protection and delay card etc; needs to be provided power for the operation of a HPC. The control power supply (CPS) is designed to operate over a wide range of input voltage from 90 Vac to 270 Vac. The CPS output supplies power at a desired voltage of Vout = 24 V to the auxiliary sub-systems of the HPC. During the starting, the power supply to the control circuitry of CPS in turn, is obtained using a separate start-up power supply. This paper discusses the various design issues of the start-up power circuit to ensure that start-up and shut down of the CPS occurs reliably. The CPS also maintains the power factor close to unity and low total harmonic distortion in input current. The paper also provides design details of gate drive circuits employed for the CPS as well as the design of on-board power supply for the CPS.

The CPS presented here, maintains the dc supply voltage to the control circuitry of a HPC constant (V-out= 24 V), {{over a wide range}} of ac input voltage variation, from 90 V(rms) to 270 V(rms). The CPS not only maintains the power factor close to unity but also maintains a low total harmonic distortion in the input ac current. This paper {{presents the}} choice of the circuit topology and the design of various components of the CPS. This paper also discusses the various closed loop strategies incorporated and their design for the CPS. The CPS was tested for wide input voltage range (v(in)) and the performance validate the design. In a micro-grid, the CPS might be exposed to transients such as large voltage sags. The CPS has been tested in such a situation and its performance allows the HPC to meet the low voltage ride-through requirements...|$|E
40|$|Denna rapport omfattar konstruktionen av ett fristående drivkort med tillhörande mobilapplikation för styrning och konfiguration av ett hydraulsystem. Projektets syfte var att på beställaren Bosch Rexroth ABs begäran undersöka om {{pump control}} module (PCM) - en del ur det existerande Spider 3 styrsystemet - kunde användas som en fristående modul. Hårdvara med en Bluetoothmodul skapades och kopplades mot PCM för att möjliggöra kommunikation via Bluetooth. En mobilapplikation utvecklades i Android studio för att tillåta konfiguration från en mobil enhet. Mjukvaran i PCM modifierades för att kommunicera med Bluetooth-hårdvaran över CAN och även för att tillåta analog styrning av pumpen via en strömstyrd ingång. De grundläggande kraven för systemet uppfylldes och en fungerande prototyp kunde uppvisas vid projektets slut. Prototypen visade stor {{potential}} men saknade dock viss funktionalitet som vore önskvärd hos en kommersiell produkt.

Hardware including a Bluetooth module was assembled and connected to the PCM to allow communication over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). A mobile application where developed in Android Studio to allow configuration from a mobile device. The software of the PCM were modified to communicate with the Bluetooth hardware over CAN and also for allowing analog control of the hydraulic pump through a current controlled input. The basic demands for the system were met and a working prototype could be demonstrated at the end of the project. The prototype did show large potential but was lacking some functionality which would be desirable for a commercial product...|$|E

40|$|Presented at the 16 th International Cryocooler Conference, held May 17 - 20, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. The Modular Advanced Cryocooler Electronics (MACE) system {{developed}} at Iris Technology Corporation combines configurable, high-power motor drives with precision telemetry capability in {{a design that}} is amenable to radiation hardening. A Telemetry Aggregation Unit (TAU) located near the cryocooler minimizes attenuation and contamination of sensitive cryocooler feedback by digitizing sensor data locally for transmission back to the controller, while multiple 500 W drive channels in the Main Control Unit (MCU) supply power waveforms at up to 95 % efficiency. The modular design concept allows for adding <b>drive</b> <b>cards</b> {{in the event that}} additional channels are required or removing <b>drive</b> <b>cards</b> to reduce size, weight, and power. The TAU incorporates up to 14 external sensors with an aggregate data rate of up to 800, 000 samples per second, dynamically allocated to any combination of telemetry by the control software. A low cost version of the electronics can be realized by populating with commercial components, or by utilizing an alternate control scheme to reduce the cost of radiation-hard controller components. A brassboard demonstration was performed at Raytheon in which the High Capacity RSP 2 (HC-RSP 2) cryocooler was driven, with temperature and vibration control loops closed at high power and low cryogenic temperatures. This paper discusses the MACE development, testing, and lessons learned...|$|R
