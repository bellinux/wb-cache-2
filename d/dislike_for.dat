5|$|After {{the results}} of the first scrutiny, Cardinal Avila, Philip III of Spain's {{representative}} at the conclave, announced that Philip had vetoed Baronius. Baronius had critiqued the claims of Spanish monarchs in ecclesistical affairs in the volume of his Annales Ecclesiastici that had been published in 1605. This led the Spanish monarchy to have such an intense <b>dislike</b> <b>for</b> him that the publication of the volume which contained his criticism was banned in Spanish territory.|$|E

5|$|Pilcher {{had married}} Kathleen Gonne, {{daughter}} of a cavalry officer, in 1889; the marriage was strained, partly through Pilcher's gambling habits and adultery, and partly through his <b>dislike</b> <b>for</b> Maud Gonne, Kathleen's sister and a prominent Irish nationalist. The couple divorced in 1911, having had four children; one would later become a High Court judge, while another died on the Western Front in 1915.

5|$|Reviewers {{agreed that}} A Link Between Worlds excelled at {{making use of}} the console's 3D capabilities.

5|$|The devotion that Beatrice showed to {{her mother}} was {{acknowledged}} in the Queen's letters and journals, but her constant need for Beatrice grew stronger. The Queen suffered another bereavement in 1883, when her highland servant, John Brown, died at Balmoral. Once again, the Queen plunged into public mourning and relied on Beatrice for support.

5|$|The show's fans {{had shown}} <b>dislike</b> <b>for</b> other antagonists with multi-episode guest-starring arcs, and critics {{suspected}} that Tritter's character would receive similar disdain. The {{conclusion of the}} storyline, and Tritter's departure from the show, were described by USA Today critic Robert Bianco as a Christmas gift for fans of the show. Morse jokingly stated after his departure that various fans had told him of their hate for Tritter after what the character had done to Dr. House.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failure}} of his first marriage, Waugh {{converted}} to Catholicism in 1930. His traditionalist stance led him to strongly oppose all attempts to reform the Church, and the changes by the Second Vatican Council (1962–65) greatly disturbed his sensibilities, especially {{the introduction of the}} vernacular Mass. That blow to his religious traditionalism, his <b>dislike</b> <b>for</b> the welfare state culture of the postwar world and the decline of his health, darkened his final years, but he continued to write. To the public, Waugh displayed a mask of indifference, but he was capable of great kindness to those whom he considered to be his friends. After his death in 1966, he acquired a following of new readers through the film and television versions of his works, such as the television serial Brideshead Revisited (1981).|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{pastiche}} {{of science}} fiction used as a backdrop, Red Dwarf is primarily a character-driven comedy, with science fiction elements used as complementary plot devices. In the early episodes, a recurring source of comedy was the Odd Couple-style {{relationship between the two}} central characters of the show, who have an intense <b>dislike</b> <b>for</b> each other yet are trapped together deep in space. The main characters are Dave Lister, the last known human alive, and Arnold Rimmer, a hologram of Lister's dead bunkmate. The other regular characters are Cat, a lifeform which evolved from the descendants of Lister's pregnant pet cat Frankenstein; Holly, Red Dwarf's computer (Series I-V, briefly in the final episode of VII, VIII); Kryten, a service mechanoid (Series II-present); and Kristine Kochanski, an alternative-reality version of Lister's long-lost love (Series VII-VIII).|$|E
5|$|He was {{intended}} to have the name Joachim, but this was stopped on request from Joachim G. Giæver who voiced his <b>dislike</b> <b>for</b> the name. He was then christened Halfdan, changed to Halvdan some years later. The family lived in Tromsø, where Paul Steenstrup Koht was a headmaster and mayor. The family moved to Skien when Halvdan was twelve years old, where his father again immersed himself in politics: he served as mayor as well as parliamentarian for the Liberal Party. Koht finished school here, taking his examen artium in 1890. His father was among his teachers {{for a while in}} Norwegian and Greek. In 1893, one year after the death of Koht's father, the family moved to Bekkelaget, a borough in Aker. Koht studied at the Royal Frederick University (now the University of Oslo).|$|E
5|$|In 1931, {{with the}} 1932–33 series in mind, the {{selectors}} had appointed Jardine as England's captain. In {{his efforts to}} build a strategy whereby he could threaten the Australian supremacy, the new captain consulted widely. Along with other observers, including Duckworth (who had kept wicket for England during the 1930 Oval Test) he thought that Bradman showed a <b>dislike</b> <b>for</b> fast, rising balls, and had been shaken when one such delivery from Larwood had {{hit him in the}} chest. This matter had been widely discussed among cricketers; a clip of film from the Oval match appeared to confirm that Bradman had flinched. This, to Jardine, suggested the basis of a plan: a sustained attack of fast leg theory that might unsettle not just Bradman but the Australian batsmen generally.|$|E

50|$|Two {{years later}} Parisian students, disillusioned by the outcome and {{underlying}} motives of the uprising, revolted in an event {{known as the}} June Rebellion.

5000|$|Cameron's {{personality}} {{remains a}} [...] "shadowy figure": being [...] "proud, aloof and difficult", {{he had a}} talent for alienating people.
