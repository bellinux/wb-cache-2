The powder was agitated and carried through the reduction furnace by a ribbon flight screw. Dissociated ammonia was metered to the reduction reactors and passed counter-currently to the bed of uranium oxide within the chemical reactor. The off-gases from the reduction reactors were passed to a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>burner</b> where the excess hydrogen was burned and then passed through a dust collector to remove any entrained uranium dioxide that might have been present. The UO2 in the reduction furnace passed through a seal hopper and a feed screw to the first of the three hydrofluorination furnaces. The bed of UO2 was moved through the hydrofluorination furnace by ribbon flight screws and contacted counter-currently by hydrofluoric acid vapors. The UF4 was removed from the third furnace and conveyed to a packaging station where the product was packaged in 10-gallon pails for use in the Metal Plant, or in 5-ton containers for shipment to the cascades. The off-gases containing water vapor formed in the reaction and excess hydrofluoric acid was removed from the first furnace and were sent to hydrofluoric acid recovery. The gases first passed to a partial condenser that removed all of the water in the form of 70% aqueous hydrofluoric acid. The remainder of the gases was then passed to a total condenser, which condenses the remainder of the acid as anhydrous hydrofluoric acid. The gases at this point contain only the nitrogen from seals and purge gases and small amounts of hydrofluoric acid that did not condense in the total condenser. These were passed through potassium hydroxide scrubbers to remove the last traces of acid and then discharged to the atmosphere.|$|E

One of the best op-tions is large scale thermochemical production of hydrogen in combination with nuclear power plant. copper-chlorine (CuCl) cycle is the most promissible ther-mochemical cycle to produce cheap hydrogen. This paper focuses on a CuCl cycle, and the describes the models how to calculate thermodynamic properties. Unfortunately, for many components in CuCl cycle the thermochemical functions of state have never been measured.

40|$|As any {{introductory}} astronomy student knows, M dwarfs are {{the most}} common stars in the Galaxy and are the faintest of the core <b>hydrogen</b> <b>burners.</b> A comprehensive study of these faint objects is crucial {{to our understanding of the}} stellar composition of the Galaxy and necessary for a more complete knowledge of the transition between main sequence M stars and their slightly less massive counterparts, the brown dwarfs, which never achieve hydrogen burning in their cores. In this thesis, a spectroscopic catalog of 125 K and M dwarfs is first presented. This catalog covers the wavelength range from 6300 to 9000 Å, near where these objects emit most of their light. Eight of these spectra, covering classes M 2 through M 9, are combined with infrared spectra from 0. 9 to 1. 5 μm to create a second catalog. The two sets of spectra are used to search for temperature-sensitive atomic lines and molecular bands, which are then used in fitting the observed spectra to a sequence of theoretical models. As a result, a new temperature scale for M dwarfs is determined, and this scale is more accurate than previous determinations which have depended on blackbody energy distributions. The sequence of spectra is also used to compare the spectrum of the brown dwarf candidate GD 165 B to known M dwarfs. Furthermore, the spectral catalog is used in an attempt to separate the spectra of faint companions from their M dwarf primaries in systems where the two objects are too close for conventional spectroscopy to resolve the individual components. A survey for faint M dwarfs is also launched using the data acquired through the CCD/Transit Instrument (CTI) on Kitt Peak, Arizona. Follow-up spectroscopy is presented for 133 of these objects, and several more very late M dwarfs are identified. This spectroscopy combined with photometric data from the CTI are used to construct a luminosity function for M dwarfs which is in excellent agreement with determinations from previous surveys. Finally, possible avenues for future work are discussed. These include spectroscopic follow-up of the reddest of Luyten's proper motion objects [...] the first results from which have uncovered, in just twelve observations, two objects of type M 7 and one of type M 8, among the coolest objects yet recognized.

40|$|In {{order to}} meet the ambitious {{reduction}} targets for future CO 2 emissions and fossil fuel consumption, the extension of renewable power systems is mandatory. One main issue is the fluctuating and unpredictable availability of renewable energy. With a higher portion of renewable energy, a secure electricity supply becomes more challenging. On days with high electricity demand but low availability of renewable energy, fossil back up power plants with high flexibility and efficiency are needed. Most applicable for this requirements are combined cycle power plants, which provide both high flexibility and efficiency. On the other hand potential renewable energy is wasted during days with low electricity demand but high available renewable energy, because electricity cannot be stored yet economically in such vast amounts. In order to use the available renewable energy more efficiently, hydrogen could be produced via electrolysis during phases of surplus available renewable energy. The hydrogen serves as a high density energy storage, which can be used as an alternative fuel in combined cycle power plants for a highly efficient reconversion into electricity if necessary. In this study it is analyzed how the usage of <b>hydrogen</b> as the <b>burner</b> fuel will influence the performance of combined cycle power plants. Therefore the on- and off-design performance of a state of the art combined cycle power plant will be calculated at different ratios of hydrogen mixtures with natural gas. The thermodynamic calculations are made with the performance software GTlab of the German Aerospace Center. Furthermore the natural gas and CO 2 savings for different hydrogen ratios will be quantified. The results show that the usage of hydrogen enriched fuel increases the combined cycle efficiency and power output. Accordingly a considerable reduction in CO 2 emissions and fossil fuel consumption is possible...|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{capture and}} storage (CCS) {{technologies}} {{allow for the}} reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions from the combustion sources of fossil fuels. One such technology {{is based on the}} use of hydrogen or hydrogen-enriched fuels and allows for a significant reduction of CO 2 emissions. All regulated pollutant emissions, except for harmful nitrogen oxides (NOx), can also be reduced using hydrogen. Hydrogen’s unique properties are challenging for burner designers. High hydrogen-air flame temperatures and flame speeds result in increased NOx emissions and significant changes in flame shape compared with conventional fuels. A novel burner concept employing partially premixed combustion and flame stabilization on a conical bluff body is here proposed to address some of these challenges. In this study a laboratory-scale burner which can operate with methane, hydrogenenriched methane and pure hydrogen has been studied. The burner performance and pollutant emissions were found to depend on factors such as fuel composition, thermal load, excess air and the burner design parameters. Particular burner operation settings affected near-burner aerodynamics and consequently NOx emissions. In more detail, {{it was found that the}} flow past the bluff body burner head exhibited vortex shedding contributing to enhanced fuel-air mixing and formed a recirculation zone behind the burner head. Flame presence increased turbulent kinetic energy production near the shear layer of the recirculation zone. The burner operated within the highly turbulent flow regime and significant turbulent kinetic energy was contained at the small scales of the flow. The burner operation was controlled by two parameters: position of the burner head and the fuel split between primary and secondary fuel ports. When the burner head was shifted upstream, NOx emissions were reduced for all fuels tested and the position of the burner head was an important parameter for the reduction of NOx emissions. This was attributed to shortened residence time in the high-temperature zone, enhanced fuel-air mixing and an increase in the amount of furnace flue gas entrained into the combustion zone. The burner head shifted upstream also resulted in lower flame stability and increased carbon monoxide emissions. Influence of the secondary fuel stream on the flow field and NOx emissions was relatively complex and affected by the remaining burner operation settings. Generally, NOx emissions increased when more fuel was provided to the burner through the secondary fuel ports. Some exceptions were observed and the secondary fuel fraction helped in reduction of NOx emissions from hydrogen combustion at low burner thermal loads. Depending on the mixing and the velocities in the burner, the secondary fuel may have penetrated the recirculation zone and the hot combustion products in this zone, what could have led to flame extinction. NOx emissions were largely dependent on the fuel composition. More hydrogen in the methane-hydrogen mixture resulted in higher NOx emissions. This is attributed to higher peak flame temperatures enhancing NOx formation via the thermal mechanism. Another factor was the furnace temperature. At higher furnace temperatures the radiative heat losses from the flame were reduced and consequently NOx emissions increased. Excess air could be used to suppress increase of NOx emissions, but it was only effective for methane and methane-hydrogen mixtures containing low fractions of hydrogen. It is believed that this effect was associated with the flame shape, which changed significantly between methane and <b>hydrogen</b> at given <b>burner</b> operation settings. Shorter and wider flames were characteristic for <b>hydrogen</b> combustion. The <b>burner</b> was capable of firing methane, hydrogen and mixtures of both of these fuels, but its operational settings had to be carefully chosen for each of these fuels in order to ensure safe burner operation and low NOx emissions. Empirical models developed on the basis of statistically cognizant experimental design allowed for NOx emissions prediction in a wide range of operating conditions. At the most promising burner operation settings and furnace temperatures of 1050 - 1150 °C, NOx emissions equivalent to 26 and 66 ppmvd at 3...|$|R

A great amount of scientific research are focused on innovative renewable energy systems in the agricultural sector. The goal is to reduce the use of fossil sources and to change the energy mix of the traditional greenhouses heating system. However, the renewables energies sources and the micro-generation systems still play a niche role in the energy panorama, mainly due to the intermittence of the energy production.
