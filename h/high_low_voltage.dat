40|$|The JCOP Framework {{is one of}} the subprojects of the Joint COntrols Project (JCOP), {{which is}} a {{collaboration}} between the four LHC experiments and CERN. By sharing development, a reduction in the overall effort required to build and maintain the experiment control systems can be obtained. As such, the main aim of the Framework is to deliver a common set of software components, tools and guidelines that can be used by the LHC experiments to build their control systems. The Framework is based on the industrial Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) tool PVSS [1] for the supervisory layer; it extends the functionality provided by customizing it for the specifics of the LHC experiments. A part of this customization is the inclusion of devices commonly used in the experiments (e. g. <b>high,</b> <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> supplies, and PLC devices). Access to an external configuration database is a further extension provided by the Framework. This paper first gives an overview of the PVSS capabilities, which are needed to understand the Framework development, described afterwards, and then introduces the Framework itself, its philosophy and its scope. The remainder of the paper concentrates on the device modelling (abstraction layer) added by the JCOP Framework as well as the configuration database subproject...|$|E

In the present study the effect of running on Spontaneous electroencephalographic activity (EEG) of rats was investigated. Method: Male wistar rats weighting 190 - 250 gr were selected and divided into control and exercise groups. The animals of exercise group were run on treadmill (I hour a day) for duration of two weeks. Then the animals in both groups were anesthetized with urethane and EEGs of them were recorded.

40|$|The cost {{of several}} circuit {{configurations}} for large (5 MW) array fields were investigated {{to assess the}} relative costs of <b>high</b> and <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> configurations. Three source circuit NOC voltages were evaluated: 400 V (ungrounded), 800 V (+ or 400 V center grounded), and 2000 V (+ or - 1000 V center grounded). Four source circuit configurations were considered {{for each of the}} three NOC voltages. The configurations correspond to source circuit currents of 15, 30, 45, and 60 amperes, respectively. Conceptual layouts for 5 MW building blocks for each of the above configurations were developed. The designs were optimized to minimize BOS electrical and structural costs. Only the BOS electrical costs were evaluated. The designs were broken down into the following elements for cost: (1) basic source circuit intermodule wiring, bypass diodes and associated hardware, source circuit to J-Box wiring, etc; (2) J-Box blocking diodes, varistors, heat sinks, and housing; (3) disconnects source circuit disconnects, fuses, and housing; (4) bus cabling J-Box to PCU interface wiring, and trenching; (5) interface bus bar, group disconnects, and fuses; and (6) fault detection shunts, signal wire, electronics, and alarm.
