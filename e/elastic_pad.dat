The new design has an advantage over the existing discrete tactile sensors and detection methods by efficiently sensing force distribution over an area without any side effects. The sensor consists of 10 × 10 infrared emitter-detector pairs, a silicon-rubber <b>elastic</b> <b>pad,</b> and a contoured tactile interface (25 x 21 moving pins) for palpating threedimensional objects. To demonstrate the practical use of the sensor, first a cylindrical tissue-like silicon phantom was prepared, then a 13 mm diameter rigid spherical object was placed at varying depths of 0 - 20 mm to simulate cancerous lumps in breast tissue, and finally the tactile sensor was systematically pressed on the phantom to successfully detect the lumps for compression depths of 10 - 24 mm. The location and the estimated radius of each lump were calculated from the recorded tactile images...|$|E

These impulses stimulate the rider's postural reflex mechanisms, resulting in training of balance and coordination. The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess the changes in magnitude and distribution of the contact pressure between the rider and the horse during a series of hippotherapeutic lessons. The monitored group, consisting of four healthy women (mean age 22. 75 years, mean body weight 59. 75 kg, mean height 167. 25 cm) without any previous horse riding experience, received five 20 minute-lessons lessons in a three-week period. Hippotherapy was given on a 15 -year-old thoroughbred mare. An <b>elastic</b> <b>pad</b> (Novel Pliance System, 30 Hz, 224 sensors) was used for pressure magnitude evaluation. The maximum pressure value was increased (<. 05) in the event of a second measurement (5 th lesson). The pressure exerted on the rider upon contact of the rear limbs was higher than upon contact of the front limbs (<. 01).

30|$|Methods for {{controlling}} train-induced vibration {{can also be}} designed based on the three stages, generation, propagation, and receiving. Damping attenuation at the source is the basic measure and the elastic support in railway substructures absorbs the energy transferred due to ground vibration propagation. Also vibration attenuation measured at the receiving end {{could be used for}} improving or revising the structural design, such as setting <b>elastic</b> <b>pads</b> for sensitive devices. The friction damping caused by irregularity of wheel–rail contact area is one of the basic requirements for train operation, so that the train-induced vibration cannot be eliminated but only be reduced. Moreover, the noise attenuation equipment for the receiving end is usually too expensive to be extensively applied in railways. Therefore, researchers focus on the propagation stage to found reasonable control methods like medium-based isolation. Asphalt concrete (AC) with high strength and flexibility has been used in the railway substructure as the damping medium for vibration attenuation. In particular, rubber-modified asphalt concrete (RMC) as a material for high-speed train foundation has benefited in train-induced vibration reduction [9]. In addition, asphalt sub-track layer, also known as asphalt underlayment, is quite commonly used in Japan and western European countries for high-speed railway construction and in the United States for track rehabilitation and maintenance [10]. However, the effect and performance of an AC sub-track layer as a mean for vibration attenuation needs to be evaluated using quantitative indicators [11].|$|R

40|$|A {{methodology}} for simulating wear, rolling contact fatigue, and plastic deformation for a mixed traffic situation in {{switches and crossings}} (S&C) has been developed. The methodology includes simulation of dynamic vehicle—track interaction considering stochastic variations in input data, simulation of wheel—rail contacts accounting for non-linear material properties and plasticity, and simulation of wear and plastic deformation in the rail during {{the life of the}} S&C component. To find means of improving the switch panel design, the geometry of a designed track gauge variation in the switch panel has been represented in a parametric way. For traffic in the facing and trailing moves of the through route, an optimum solution was identified and then validated by evaluating a wide set of simulation cases (using different wheel profiles). The optimum design includes a 12 mm maximum gauge widening. Several crossing geometries were investigated to find an optimal geometric design for the crossing nose and wing rails. The MaKüDe design showed the best performance for moderately worn wheel profiles in both running directions (facing and trailing moves). In connection with reduced support stiffness (e. g. <b>elastic</b> rail <b>pads),</b> this crossing design is predicted to lead to a significant reduction of impact loads and consequently provide a high potential of life-cycle cost reduction...|$|R
40|$|Investigation of the {{influence}} of the differences in the support conditions on the dynamic parameters are presented in this study. Bridge girders are usually supported by elastic bearings and suffer deterioration during the service life of the bridge. Early stages of deterioration of the elastic bearing occur with decrease in its stiffness. Advance stages of deterioration causes total damage of the elastic bearing, whereby the bridge girder will be supported directly on the structural element below it. The deterioration can occur on one or both sides of the supports. In order to study the effect of this phenomenon, experiments were conducted on a simply supported beam supported on <b>elastic</b> rubber <b>pads</b> with different stiffness as well as on steel supports. The undamaged support condition was simulated by using new rubber pads with stiffness of 10 MN/m. The damage support conditions were represented by using old rubber pads with stiffness of 3 MN/m and using steel supports to simulate the case of total deterioration of the rubber bearing pads. Natural frequencies and mode shapes were obtained from modal testing and compared using of Modal Assurance Criteria MAC. The results showed a direct relationship between the support stiffness and the natural frequencies and mode shape. The first bending mode was most sensitive to the changes in support stiffness followed by Mode 2. It was also observed that the other modes had similar but lower sensitivity to the state of deterioartion of the supports...|$|R
40|$|Elastic {{elements}} such as rail pads, under sleeper pads and under ballast mats are railway components that allow for a reduction in track deterioration and vibrations. And they are furthermore commonly used to obtain an optimal vertical stiffness of the infrastructure. However, the use of elastomeric materials can increase construction costs and the consumption of raw materials. Thus, the utilization of used tire layers offers an alternative to reuse an abundant waste reducing the cost of elastic elements. In addition, an innovator technique allows deconstructing tire layers without grinding up the material, reducing production costs {{at the same time}} that tire properties are remained. This research is focused on the study of the viability of developing elastic components from used tire layers by evaluating the influence of thickness, the resistance capacity of the elements and their behavior in a ballast box.

40|$|The present {{success in}} the {{manufacture}} of multi-layer interconnects in ultra-large-scale integration is largely due to the acceptable planarization capabilities of the chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) process. In the past decade, copper has emerged as the preferred interconnect material. The greatest challenge in Cu CMP at present is the control of wafer surface non-uniformity at various scales. As the size of a wafer has increased to 300 mm, the wafer-level non-uniformity has assumed critical importance. Moreover, the pattern geometry in each die has become quite complex due {{to a wide range of}} feature sizes and multi-level structures. Therefore, it is important to develop a non-uniformity model that integrates wafer-, die- and feature-level variations into a unified, multi-scale dielectric erosion and Cu dishing model. In this paper, a systematic way of characterizing and modeling dishing in the single-step Cu CMP process is presented. The possible causes of dishing at each scale are identified in terms of several geometric and process parameters. The feature-scale pressure calculation based on the step-height at each polishing stage is introduced. The dishing model is based on <b>pad</b> <b>elastic</b> deformation and the evolving pattern geometry, and is integrated with the wafer- and die-level variations. Experimental and analytical means of determining the model parameters are outlined and the model is validated by polishing experiments on patterned wafers. Finally, practical approaches for minimizing Cu dishing are suggested. Singapore-MIT Alliance (SMA...|$|R
40|$|International audienceShock {{absorption}} is {{the most}} important function of the human heel pad. However, changes in heel pad elasticity, as seen in e. g. long-distance runners, diabetes patients, and victims of Falanga torture are affecting this function, often in a painful manner. Assessment of heel pad elasticity is usually based on one or a few strain measurements obtained by an external load-deformation system. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a technique for quantitative measurements of heel <b>pad</b> <b>elastic</b> modulus based on several internal strain measures from within the heel pad by use of ultrasound images. Nine heel phantoms were manufactured featuring a combination of three heel pad stiffnesses and three heel pad thicknesses to model the normal human variation. Each phantom was tested in an indentation system comprising a 7 MHz linear array ultrasound transducer, working as the indentor, and a connected load cell. Load-compression data and ultrasound B-mode images were simultaneously acquired in 19 compression steps of 0. 1 mm each. The internal tissue displacement was for each step calculated by a phase-based cross-correlation technique and internal strain maps were derived from these displacement maps. Elastic moduli were found from the resulting stress-strain curves. The elastic moduli made it possible to distinguish eight of nine phantoms from each other according to the manufactured stiffness and showed very little dependence of the thickness. Mean elastic moduli for the three soft, the three medium, and the three hard phantoms were 89 kPa, 153 kPa, and 168 kPa, respectively. The combination of ultrasound images and force measurements provided an effective way of assessing the elastic properties of the heel pad due to the internal strain estimation...|$|R
40|$|The {{ever-increasing}} {{demand for}} high-performance microelectronic devices has motivated {{the semiconductor industry}} to design and manufacture Ultra-Large-Scale Integrated (ULSI) circuits with smaller feature size, higher resolution, denser packing, and multi-layer interconnects. The ULSI technology places stringent demands on global planarity of the Interlevel Dielectric (ILD) layers. Compared with other planarization techniques, the Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) process produces excellent local and global planarization at low cost. It is thus widely adopted for planarizing inter-level dielectric (silicon dioxide) layers. Moreover, CMP is a critical process for fabricating the Cu damascene patterns, low-k dielectrics, and shallow isolated trenches. The wide range of materials to be polished concurrently or sequentially, however, increases the complexity of CMP and necessitates {{an understanding of the}} process fundamentals for optimal process design. This thesis establishes a theoretical framework to relate the process parameters to the different wafer/pad contact modes to study the behavior of wafer-scale polishing. Several models of polishing - microcutting, brittle fracture, surface melting and burnishing - are reviewed. Blanket wafers coated {{with a wide range of}} materials are polished to verify the models. Plastic deformation is identified as the dominant mechanism of material removal in fine abrasive polishing. (cont.) Additionally, contact mechanics models, which relate the pressure distribution to the pattern geometry and <b>pad</b> <b>elastic</b> properties, explain the die-scale variation of material removal rate (MRR) on pattern geometry. The pad displacement into low features of submicron lines is less than 0. 1 nm. Hence the applied load is only carried by the high features, and the pressure on high features increases with the area fraction of interconnects. Experiments study the effects of pattern geometry on the rates of pattern planarization, oxide overpolishing and Cu dishing. It was observed that Cu dishing of submicron features is less than 20 nm and contributes less to surface non-uniformity than does oxide overpolishing. Finally, a novel in situ detection technique, based on the change of the reflectance of the patterned surface at different polishing stages, is developed to detect the process endpoint and minimize overpolishing. Models that employ light scattering theory and statistical treatment correlate the sampled reflectance with the surface topography and Cu area fraction for detecting the process regime and endpoint. The experimental results agree well with the endpoint detection schemes predicted by the models. by Jiun-Yu Lai. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Tilting pad journal {{bearings}} (TPJBs) supporting rotors for high performance turbomachinery have undergone steady design improvements to satisfy more stringent operating conditions that include large specific loads due to smaller footprints, and high surface speeds that produce larger drag power losses and lubricant temperature rise. Simultaneously, predictive models continuously evolve to include minute details on bearing geometry, pads and pivots? configurations, oil delivery systems, etc. This thesis introduces a fluid film flow model including both pad and pivot flexibility {{to predict the}} static and dynamic force performance of typical TPJBs. This performance encompasses journal eccentricity, drag power loss, lubricant temperature rise, fluid film thickness, fluid film pressure, bearing complex stiffnesses, static stiffnesses, damping coefficients and virtual mass coefficients. A finite element (FE) pad structural model (with/without the Babbitt layer) is coupled to a thin film flow model to determine the mechanical deformation of the pad upper surface. Recently, Gaines and Childs conducted experiments with three TPJB sets, each having three pads, over a range of load and rotational speed conditions. To quantify the effect of pad flexibility on the bearings? dynamic performance, the pad thickness varies from thin to thick, t= 8. 5 mm, 10 mm and 11. 5 mm. The test data shows that pad flexibility reduces the journal eccentricity and the dynamic force coefficients. The current model with both pad and pivot flexibility delivers predictions correlating favorably with the test data, in particular the bearing stiffnesses, yet it overestimates the bearing damping coefficients. Predictions for bearing models available in the archival literature show that the maximum pad surface deformation occurs on the loaded pad at both its leading and trailing edges; i. e. under mechanical pressure a pad opens. The deformation at the pad mid-plane (Z= 0) is slightly larger than that at the pad side edges (Z=? 1 / 2 L). Contrary {{to the effect of}} pivot flexibility that leads to an increase in journal eccentricity, pad flexibility tends to reduce the journal eccentricity, similar as in tests reported by Gaines. A soft <b>pad</b> (<b>elastic)</b> decreases significantly the bearing stiffnesses and the damping coefficients by up to 20 %. A parametric study follows to quantify the influence of pad thickness on the rotordynamic force coefficients of two sample TPJBs: one with three pads of increasing preload, (p r = 0, 0. 25 and 0. 5), and another one with four pads of null preload (p r = 0). The bearing pads are either rigid or flexible by varying their thickness. For design considerations, dimensionless static and dynamic characteristics of the bearings are presented versus the Sommerfeld number (S). An appendix introduces a one-dimensional beam equation to approximate the pad deformation accounting for the Babbitt layer. Based on this equation, a dimensionless pad flexibility parameter is defined. Pad flexibility shows a more pronounced effect on the journal eccentricity and the force coefficients of a TPJB with null pad preload than for bearings with large pad preloads (0. 25 and 0. 5), in particular for operation with a small load or at a high surface speed (S> 0. 8). With the same pad preload, pad flexibility affects more the dynamic force coefficients for a load on pad (LOP) bearing than those for a load between pad (LBP) bearing...|$|R
