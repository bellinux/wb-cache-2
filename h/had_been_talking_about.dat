500|$|As a teacher, Rabi was underwhelming. Leon Lederman {{recalled}} {{that after a}} lecture, students would head to the library {{to try to work}} out what Rabi <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> Irving Kaplan rated Rabi and Harold Urey as [...] "the worst teachers I ever had".

Despite his shortcomings as a lecturer, his influence was great. He inspired many of his students to pursue careers in physics, and some became famous.|$|E
500|$|The {{ideas for}} [...] "One More Day" [...] {{began to develop}} almost two years before its release, at one of Marvel's {{creative}} summits for creators and editors. Quesada, Straczynski, Brian Michael Bendis, Mark Millar, Jeph Loeb, Tom Brevoort and Axel Alonso developed the concept between them, and Ed Brubaker and Dan Slott added more at the next summit. [...] "One More Day" [...] was announced as the concluding storyline of Straczynski's run on Amazing Spider-Man in early 2007, and Quesada was named as the artist for the storyline. Although Quesada had become more selective in choosing projects to do as an artist since becoming editor-in-chief, he felt compelled to do the art for One More Day because he felt {{very close to the}} story, and because since he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the project for so long, he felt he [...] "needed to put my money where my mouth is." ...|$|E

[...] Anthony Field remained in the group because he found it too difficult {{to give up and}} because he still had a passion for educating children. [...] According to Paul Field, his brother staying in the band [...] "was a vital decision to placate American, British and Canadian business partners". [...] Page, Fatt, and Cook remained involved with the creative and production aspects of the group. [...] Fatt and Cook <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> quitting touring for many years; Cook announced his intention to retire first, citing a desire {{to spend more time with}} his family, and then Fatt announced his own retirement shortly thereafter. [...] Page, who was still struggling with his health issues and had stated that his interest was in working with the group's original line-up, was subsequently asked to extend his stay until the end of the year so he would leave alongside Cook and Fatt, to which he agreed. [...] Cook reported that the original members were confident that the new group would be accepted by the fans because they passed on their founding concepts of early childhood education to Watkins, Gillespie, and Pryce. [...] The new members, like Moran, who was not approached to return, were salaried employees.|$|E

2500|$|Two {{additional}} {{plans were}} added to Operation Freakout on April 13, 1976.

The fifth plan was for a Scientologist to warn an Arab consulate by telephone that Paulette Cooper <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> bombing it. A sixth and final plan was added subsequently. It was effectively a re-run of the 1972 plot, requiring Scientologists to obtain Paulette Cooper's fingerprints on a blank piece of paper, type a threatening letter to Kissinger on that paper, and mail it. Guardian's Office staff member Bruce Raymond noted in an internal memo: [...] "This additional channel [...] should really have put her away. Worked with all the other channels.

2500|$|Game {{journalist}} Geoff Keighley, who {{had been}} in discussions with Murray and Hello Games throughout the development, had expressed concern to Murray in the year leading up to release, according to Keighley in September 2016. He said he was [...] "internally conflicted" [...] {{about the state of the}} game near its release, recognising that many of the features that Murray <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> were not going to make it, and compared Murray to Peter Molyneux who had overpromised on a vision for his games that ultimately fell short. Keighley had expressed to Murray his concern that the $60 price tag was a bit steep for the current state of the game and recommended that they take an early access approach instead. According to Keighley, Murray said he didn't want to be around Keighley any more as he was [...] "a little too negative about the game and 's assessment of where the team was at". Keighley felt that Murray could not [...] "rip off that band-aid" [...] and explain exactly what had made it and had to be cut for the game prior to release, and in the end appeared to [...] "disrespect his audience". As such, Keighley sympathised with those that felt they were misled by the marketing. Keighley rekindled the relationship with Murray since launch, and anticipated discussing more of what happened near release with him. Sony Chairman Shawn Layden, in November 2016, stated that Hello Games had an [...] "incredible vision" [...] and a [...] "very huge ambition" [...] for No Man's Sky, and that the developers are still working to update the game to bring it to what they wanted, adding that [...] "sometimes you just don't get all the way there at the first go". Layden further expressed that from Sony's side, they recognised that they [...] "don't want to stifle ambition" [...] and force a specific style of play onto their games.|$|E
2500|$|Lynch and Frost {{pitched the}} idea to ABC during the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike in a ten-minute meeting with the network's drama head, Chad Hoffman, {{with nothing more than}} this image and a concept. According to the director, the mystery of who killed Laura Palmer was {{initially}} {{going to be in the}} foreground, but would recede gradually as viewers got to know the other townsfolk and the problems they were having. Lynch and Frost wanted to mix a police investigation with a soap opera. ABC liked the idea and asked Lynch and Frost to write a screenplay for the pilot episode. They <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the project for three months and wrote the screenplay in 10 days. Frost wrote more verbal characters, like Benjamin Horne, while Lynch was responsible for Agent Cooper. According to the director, [...] "He says a lot of the things I say." [...] ABC Entertainment President Brandon Stoddard ordered the two-hour pilot for a possible fall 1989 series. He left the position in March 1989 as Lynch went into production. They filmed the pilot for $4 million with an agreement with ABC that they would shoot an additional [...] "ending" [...] to it so that it could be sold directly to video in Europe as a feature film if the TV show was not picked up. ABC's Robert Iger and his creative team took over, saw the dailies, and met with Frost and Lynch to get the arc of the stories and characters. Although Iger liked the pilot, he had difficulty persuading the rest of the network executives. Iger suggested showing it to a more diverse, younger group, who liked it, and the executive subsequently convinced ABC to buy seven episodes at $1.1 million apiece. Some executives figured that the show would never get on the air or that it might run as a seven-hour mini-series, but Iger planned to schedule it for the spring. The final showdown occurred during a bi-coastal conference call between Iger and a room full of New York executives; Iger won, and Twin Peaks was on the air.|$|E
