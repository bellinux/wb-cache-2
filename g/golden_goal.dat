5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, the IFAB experimented with ways of {{creating}} a winner without requiring a penalty shootout, which was often seen as an undesirable way to end a match. These involved rules ending a game in extra time early, either when the first goal in extra time was scored (<b>golden</b> <b>goal),</b> or if one team held a lead {{at the end of}} the first period of extra time (silver goal). <b>Golden</b> <b>goal</b> was used at the World Cup in 1998 and 2002. The first World Cup game decided by a <b>golden</b> <b>goal</b> was France's victory over Paraguay in 1998. Germany was the first nation to score a <b>golden</b> <b>goal</b> in a major competition, beating Czech Republic in the final of Euro 1996. Silver goal was used in Euro 2004. Both these experiments have been discontinued by IFAB.|$|E

5|$|The <b>golden</b> <b>goal</b> {{was used}} during extra-time, {{which meant that}} {{whatever}} team scored first would win. Liverpool kicked off {{the first half of}} extra-time and within three minutes, Alavés looked like they had scored a <b>golden</b> <b>goal.</b> Ivan Alonso had put the ball in the Liverpool goal, but it was ruled out as Alonso was offside. A minute later, Óscar Téllez was booked for fouling Robbie Fowler. Within four minutes, Alavés had been reduced to 10 men. Magno was shown a second yellow card for a two-footed challenge on Markus Babbel. With a minute {{of the first half of}} extra-time remaining, Fowler thought he had scored the winning goal, however it was disallowed as he was offside.|$|E

In the semi-final against France, Nedvěd was named man of the match as the Czech Republic {{advanced}} to the final after a penalty shoot–out, where he scored his nation's second penalty shot. He and the Czech Republic team lost 2–1 in the final to Germany, who scored a <b>golden</b> <b>goal.</b>|$|E
50|$|International {{field hockey}} tournaments {{such as the}} Hockey World Cup and Champions Trophy had used <b>golden</b> <b>goals</b> to decide the winners of {{elimination}} matches. During these matches, two extra periods of 7½ minutes each were played, and if no <b>golden</b> <b>goals</b> were scored after both periods of extra time, a penalty stroke competition decided the game. FIH, the sport's governing body, did away with the overtime procedure in 2013, and now teams {{go directly to the}} shootout.|$|R

The game was scoreless after 90 minutes and went to extra time, where Claudia Müller scored a <b>golden</b> <b>goal</b> and secured the fifth European title for Germany.|$|E
5|$|Alavés {{kicked off}} {{the second half of}} extra-time and within seconds, Babbel was booked for {{bringing}} down Alavés defender Delfí Geli 30 yards from goal. The resulting free-kick was put wide by Hermes Desio. Three minutes later, Liverpool had a chance to score, but Fowler could not reach Steven Gerrard's cross and the ball was subsequently cleared from the Alavés penalty area. In the 115th minute of the match, Alavés were reduced to nine men, when Antonio Karmona received a second yellow card for fouling Smicer. McAllister took the resulting free-kick, which was headed into his own goal by Geli. As a result of the <b>golden</b> <b>goal,</b> Liverpool had won the match 5–4 to win their third UEFA Cup and complete a Treble.|$|E
5|$|Buffon played {{every minute}} of Italy's 2002 World Cup campaign, keeping a clean sheet in the opening match against Ecuador, and saving a {{controversial}} penalty against co-hosts South Korea in the round of 16, which {{was not enough to}} stop the under-performing side from being eliminated by a <b>golden</b> <b>goal</b> in extra time. He also featured in every match at Euro 2004, keeping a clean sheet in his nation's opening 0–0 draw against Denmark, although Italy, despite not losing a match, once again underperformed, and were eliminated in the first round on direct encounters following a three-way, five-point tie with Sweden and Denmark.|$|E
50|$|On {{their way}} to the final, {{defending}} champions Brazil, coached by their former player Mário Zagallo, recorded victories over Scotland (2-1) and Morocco (3-0) to top their group with 6 points from three matches, suffering a surprise 2-1 defeat at the hands of Norway in their final group game.

50|$|In a {{qualification}} {{game for}} the 1994 Caribbean Cup, Barbados deliberately scored a late own goal in a successful attempt {{to qualify for the}} finals by forcing golden-goal extra time against Grenada, as an unusual tournament rule stated that <b>golden</b> <b>goals</b> counted double in calculating goal difference. Needing a two-goal victory to qualify, Barbados found themselves 2-1 up with three minutes left of normal time. After the Barbadians scored an own goal to bring the scoreline level at 2-2, Grenada tried to score in either net while Barbados defended both goals for the final three minutes of normal time. Barbados won the game in extra time and advanced to the next round.|$|R

5|$|The European Championship final is {{the last}} match of the competition, and the result determines which country's team is {{declared}} European champion. As of the 2016 tournament, if after 90 minutes of regular play the score is a draw, an additional 30-minute period of play, called extra time, is added. If such a game is still tied after extra time, it is decided by penalty shoot-out. The team that wins the penalty shoot-out are then declared champions. The 15 finals to-date have produced five drawn matches, the eventual winners {{of which have been}} determined variously by replay (1968), extra time (1960, 2016), penalty shoot-out (1976) or <b>golden</b> <b>goal</b> (1996, 2000).

50|$|Due to a {{transfer}} of broadcast rights, the entries for the 2001-02, 2002-03 and 2003-04 seasons were decided on ITV's The Premiership, which have been subsequently recognised by the BBC. When the BBC previously could not show league footage from 1988-89 to 1991-92, the winning goal in each season was scored in the FA Cup which they held the rights to. League rights holder ITV had its own competition during these seasons for Goal of the Season, broadcast on the Saint and Greavsie show. Previously the channels had shared league and cup rights (showing different matches to each other) and for many years ITV broadcast its own <b>Golden</b> <b>Goals</b> competition as an equivalent of Goal of the Season. From 2013-14 season onwards, the Goal of the Season has been chosen by a Twitter poll and the BBC Sport website. Jack Wilshere is {{the first player to}} win Goal of the Season in consecutive seasons (2013-14 and 2014-15) {{since the start of the}} Premier League. The 1987-88 competition was unique in that all 10 goals shortlisted were scored by Liverpool players.
