5|$|Efforts to {{calculate}} the true economic value of unpaid work, which {{is not included in}} measures such as gross domestic product, have shown that this value <b>is</b> <b>enormous.</b> In the United States, it has been estimated to be between 20–50%, meaning that the true value of unpaid work is trillions of dollars per year. For other countries, the percentage of GDP may be even higher, such as the United Kingdom, where is may be as high as 70%. Because this unpaid work is largely done by women and is unreported in economic indicators, it results in these contributions by women being devalued in a society.|$|E

25|$|Nondualist Kashmir Shaivism went {{underground}} for {{a number}} of centuries. While there may have been yogis and practitioners quietly following the teachings, there were no major writers or publications after perhaps the 14th century. In the 20th century Swami Lakshman Joo, himself a Kashmiri Brahmin, helped revive both the scholarly and yogic streams of Kashmir Shaivism. His contribution <b>is</b> <b>enormous.</b> He inspired a generation of scholars who made Kashmir Shaivism a legitimate field of inquiry within the academy.|$|E
25|$|There <b>is</b> <b>enormous</b> {{variation}} in body structure amongst insect species. Individuals {{can range from}} 0.3mm (fairyflies) to 30cm across (great owlet moth); have no eyes or many; well-developed wings or none; and legs modified for running, jumping, swimming, or even digging. These modifications allow insects to occupy almost every ecological niche on the planet, except the deep ocean and the Antarctic. This article describes the basic insect body {{and some of the}} major variations of the different body parts; in the process it defines many of the technical terms used to describe insect bodies.|$|E
25|$|The {{gap between}} rich and poor <b>is</b> <b>enormous</b> in a country that was once the most egalitarian nation in the world. In the youth movements, Zionism was seen as the Jewish way of {{achieving}} social justice that would encompass the whole world. That ideal has been shattered. Now we have the pretension of being an open and attentive socialist welfare state, but in fact, that message only comes from a single direction. The system only responds to those who shout. Those who are silent remain on the outside. The basic human element has disappeared from the system.|$|E

Then there is the problem of the unemployment of women and the high rate of illiteracy here. We need to help realise programmes to ensure people can get an income, that they can enjoy a reasonable standard of living.|$|E
25|$|Thus primary {{production}} – {{the conversion of}} sunlight into organic biomass, {{the foundation of the}} food chain – has an annual carbon fixation of 1–2g/m2 in the open ocean. Close to the ice it can reach 30–50g/m2. These values are not outstandingly high, compared to very productive areas like the North Sea or upwelling regions, but the area over which it takes place <b>is</b> <b>enormous,</b> even compared to other large primary producers such as rainforests. In addition, during the Austral summer there are many hours of daylight to fuel the process. All of these factors make the plankton and the krill a critical part of the planet's ecocycle.|$|E
25|$|How is the {{enormous}} {{diversity in the}} shape, color and sizes of flowers established? There <b>is</b> <b>enormous</b> variation in the developmental program in different plants. For example, monocots possess structures like lodicules and palea, that {{were believed to be}} analogous to the dicot petals and carpels respectively.It turns out that this is true, and the variation is due to slight changes in the MADS-box genes and their expression pattern in the monocots. Another example is that of the toad-flax, Linaria vulgaris, which has two kinds of flower symmetries: radial and bilateral. These symmetries are due to epigenetic changes in just one gene called CYCLOIDEA.|$|E

25|$|In Papua New Guinea, {{renewable}} energy sources represent two-thirds of the total electricity supply. In 2015, the Secretariat of the Pacific Community observed that, 'while Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Samoa are leading the way with large-scale hydropower projects, there <b>is</b> <b>enormous</b> potential to expand the deployment of other {{renewable energy}} options such as solar, wind, geothermal and ocean-based energy sources'. The European Union has funded the Renewable Energy in Pacific Island Countries Developing Skills and Capacity programme (EPIC). Since its inception in 2013, the programme has developed a master’s programme in renewable energy management at the University of Papua New Guinea and helped to establish a Centre of Renewable Energy at the same university.|$|E
25|$|The main nave <b>is</b> <b>enormous</b> {{and very}} tall. At the front is an apse, which like the area under the choir has a vault with Gothic nerves which form a star pattern. The current main altar found {{here is not}} the {{original}}. The original altar was Baroque which contained twelve paintings {{with each of the}} Apostles as well as one of John the Baptist and Saint Augustine. These paintings have since been moved to the pinacotheca of the Cuernavaca cathedral. The current altar is a large white 19th century Neoclassical style piece, inspired by a Roman mausoleum. It has two levels on a circular base with a Corinthian style capitol. It features an image of John the Baptist.|$|E
25|$|White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) — The {{population}} in the state <b>is</b> <b>enormous</b> and growing {{in large part because}} of the expansion of rural residential lands that are hospitable for deer but not suitable for hunting. Other factors are the mixture of young and mature forests, milder winters, and fewer predators. Deer were nearly eliminated from the state by the end of the nineteenth century, with fewer than 20 in all of Connecticut, although they were on the rebound by that point, in part due to state regulations to protect them. In 1907 the state allowed landowners to shoot deer causing crop damage.l In 1974, the state passed its first deer management act and regular, licensed deer hunting began the next year. By the 1970s, the total state population was about 20,000, and up to 76,000 (a low estimate) in 2000.|$|E

25|$|Prešeren's {{legacy in}} Slovene culture <b>is</b> <b>enormous.</b> He is {{generally}} regarded as the national poet. In 1905, his monument was placed at the central square in Ljubljana, now called Prešeren Square. By the early 1920s, all his surviving work had been catalogued and numerous critical editions of his works had been published. Several scholars were already dealing exclusively with the analysis of his work and little was left unknown about his life. In 1945, the anniversary of his death, called Prešeren Day, was declared as the Slovene cultural holiday. In 1989, his Zdravljica was declared the national anthem of Slovenia, replacing the old Naprej, zastava slave. In 1992, his effigy was portrayed on the Slovene 1000 tolar banknote, and since 2007, his image is on the Slovene two-euro coin. The highest Slovene prize for artistic achievements, the Prešeren Award, is named after him.|$|E
25|$|Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) do {{not occur}} {{homogeneously}} across the human genome. In fact, there <b>is</b> <b>enormous</b> diversity in SNP frequency between genes, reflecting different selective pressures on each gene as well as different mutation and recombination rates across the genome. However, studies on SNPs are biased towards coding regions, the data generated from them are unlikely to reflect the overall distribution of SNPs throughout the genome. Therefore, the SNP Consortium protocol was designed to identify SNPs with no bias towards coding regions and the Consortium's 100,000 SNPs generally reflect sequence diversity across the human chromosomes.The SNP Consortium aims to expand the number of SNPs identified across the genome to 300 000 {{by the end of}} the first quarter of 2001. Changes in non-coding sequence and synonymous changes in coding sequence are generally more common than non-synonymous changes, reflecting greater selective pressure reducing diversity at positions dictating amino acid identity. Transitional changes are more common than transversions, with CpG dinucleotides showing the highest mutation rate, presumably due to deamination.|$|E
25|$|The strict {{adherence}} to cadency, or {{the need for}} cadets to difference their arms from {{the chief of the}} family, is due to the permanence of the old families. From an early period the leading families of England were extinguished in the male line. Some continue to exist in the male line, but are comparatively obscure, having sprung from untitled cadets of the ancient families. On the other hand, the Scoto-Norman barons were remarkable for their numerous progeny. Sub-infeudation, which had been prohibited in England since the time of the Plantagenet kings, was largely practiced in Scotland. Whole districts of Scotland have their predominant names, which are generally those of the old feudal families. Surnames were {{for a long time after}} their introduction, used only by the gentry; and when they began to be assumed by the lower orders, the clansman almost invariably took the name of his chief, considering himself a member of his family, at least by adoption, if not by blood. In England new men emerged, and founded new families; it was easier to adopt new arms rather than trace a connection with those who had died. Hence it came to pass that while in England the multitude of entirely distinct coats of arms <b>is</b> <b>enormous,</b> in Scotland the number of original coats is small.|$|E
