It may prove less expensive than other imaging methods currently under study.|$|E
5|$|Elaborate body {{structures}} of many modern-day animals usually serve to attract {{members of the}} opposite sex during mating. It is quite possible that the sails or humps of these dinosaurs were used for courtship, in a way similar to a peacock's tail. Stromer speculated that males and females may have differed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of the neural spine.|$|E

5|$|Four {{subspecies}} of cowpea are recognised, {{of which}} three are cultivated.

Cowpeas can be erect, semi erect (trailing) or climbing. The crop is mainly grown for its seeds, which are extremely high in protein, although the leaves and immature seed pods can also be consumed.|$|E

5|$|Proteasome inhibitors {{have also}} shown promise in {{treating}} autoimmune diseases in animal models.

5|$|The American kestrel is {{a common}} bird used in falconry, {{especially}} by beginners. Though not as strong a flyer as many other larger falcons, proper training and weight control by the falconer allows many American kestrels to become effective hunters of birds <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> range of sparrows and starlings, with occasional success against birds up to approximately twice their own weight.|$|E

5|$|The {{homomorphism}} {{problem with}} a single fixed graph G on left side of input instances can be solved by brute-force in time |V(H)|O(|V(G)|), so polynomial <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of the input graph H. In other words, the problem is trivially in P for graphs G of bounded size. The interesting question is then what other properties of G, beside size, make polynomial algorithms possible.|$|E
5|$|Adaptation is the {{evolutionary}} process whereby an organism becomes {{better able to}} live in its habitat or habitats. Ecological factors such as habitat type, climate, prey specialization, and predatory competition {{have been shown to}} greatly influence gray wolf craniodental plasticity, which is an adaptation of the cranium and teeth due to the influences of the environment. Similarly, the dire wolf was a hypercarnivore, with a skull and dentition adapted for hunting large and struggling prey; the shape of its skull and snout changed across time, and changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of its body have been correlated to climate fluctuations.|$|E
5|$|After the election, Paul was speculated {{to run for}} {{president}} in 1992 but opted instead to work on the campaign for Pat Buchanan. That year, Marrou received the Libertarian presidential nomination. Paul later returned to the Republican Party and was re-elected to his seat in Congress in 1996, without much support from establishment Republicans, who supported the party-switching Democratic incumbent of the seat. Back in Congress, Paul regained his nickname of Dr. No, favoring a free market and advocating a reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of the federal government. He was drafted to challenge President George W. Bush in the 2004 Republican primaries, but chose not to run. He ran {{for president}} again in 2008 and 2012 as a Republican, attracting a large amount of grassroots support.|$|E

5|$|After the executions, Temeraire was {{immediately}} sent to sea, sailing from Portsmouth for the Isle of Wight {{the day after}} and beginning preparations for her delayed voyage to the West Indies. She sailed for Barbados, arriving there on 24 February, and remained in the West Indies until the summer. During her time there the Treaty of Amiens was finally signed and ratified, and Temeraire was ordered back to Britain. She arrived at Plymouth on 28 September and Eyles paid her off on 5 October. Because of the drawdown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of the active navy {{as a result of}} the peace, Temeraire was laid up in the Hamoaze for the next eighteen months.|$|E
5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} characterised by loss of neurons and synapses in the {{cerebral}} cortex and certain subcortical regions. This loss results in gross atrophy {{of the affected}} regions, including degeneration in the temporal lobe and parietal lobe, {{and parts of the}} frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus. Degeneration is also present in brainstem nuclei like the locus coeruleus. Studies using MRI and PET have documented reductions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of specific brain regions in people with AD as they progressed from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease, and in comparison with similar images from healthy older adults.|$|E
5|$|Baird was {{appointed}} President of the Treasury Board on February 6, 2006.

Baird also indicated that his government was not planning to introduce job cuts or initiate a radical reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of government. In June 2006 he announced the creation of a three-member panel to advise the federal government on grant and contribution programs and accountability issues. One of the members was Frances Lankin, a former Ontario New Democratic Party cabinet minister.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{variations}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of {{the yearly}} catch, Hume and others believed his methods of fish-propagation to be successful. However, as salmon runs declined over time despite the hatcheries, recreational fishing interests began to oppose large-scale operations. In 1910, a state referendum banned commercial fishing on the Rogue, but {{this decision was}} reversed in 1913. As fish runs continued to dwindle, the state legislature finally closed the river to commercial fishing in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Between World WarI and World WarII Australia {{suffered}} {{greatly from}} the Great Depression {{which started in}} 1929.

In 1931, the Statute of Westminster granted the Australian government independence in foreign affairs and defence. Nevertheless, from the mid-1930s, Australian governments generally followed British policy towards Nazi Germany, supporting first the appeasement of Hitler and the British guarantee of Polish independence.|$|E
5|$|Crassus {{was given}} a praetorship, and {{assigned}} six new legions {{in addition to the}} two formerly consular legions of Gellius and Lentulus, giving him an estimated army of some 32,000–48,000 trained Roman infantrymen plus their attached auxiliaries (there being quite a historical range <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of Republican Legions). Crassus treated his legions with harsh, even brutal, discipline, reviving the punishment of unit decimation within his army. Appian is uncertain whether he decimated the two consular legions for cowardice when he was appointed their commander, or whether he had his entire army decimated for a later defeat (an event in which up to 4,000 legionaries would have been executed).|$|E
