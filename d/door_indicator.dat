2500|$|Initially the 1960 stock {{cars were}} coupled to two modernised [...] "Standard Stock" [...] trailers, {{numbered}} 4900-4911. Originally {{the cars were}} to have been numbered starting at 4000. Conversion work included the fitting of fluorescent lighting, the addition of <b>door</b> <b>indicator</b> lights {{to the outside of}} the cars, and painting in silver paint, to match the unpainted aluminium of the motor cars. Four of the trailers had been built in 1927, and only included two sets of double central doors. Two of these were rebuilt with additional single doors at each end. The rest of the trailers were built in 1931, and included the extra single doors when built. Four of these trailers were later fitted with de-icing gear, and carried a 'D' below the running number to indicate this. By 1974, the trailers were a serious maintenance problem, and a decision was taken to replace them with single 1938 Stock cars marshalled between the two motor cars, reducing the units from four to three cars. Conversion work included the fitting of two compressors, as the pre-1938 trailers had been equipped with one each, but the process was costly, and only three sets were completed.|$|E

25|$|During {{its initial}} descent towards its destination, the {{attendant}} reported {{that one of}} the cabin <b>door's</b> <b>indicators</b> was showing an unlocked condition. Shortly afterwards, the right hand rear door (the baggage door) opened, detached itself from its hinge mounts and became lodged on {{the leading edge of the}} right horizontal tailplane. Later reconstruction of the aircraft's flight path from flight recorder evidence indicated that cabin decompression occurred when it was in the vicinity of Market Bosworth.|$|R

50|$|Between 1988 and 1989, the R42s {{underwent}} overhaul as {{a result}} of deferred maintenance in the New York City Subway during the 1970s and the 1980s. 282 cars (4550-4839) were overhauled by Morrison-Knudsen while the last 110 cars (4840-4949) were rebuilt in-house by the Coney Island Overhaul Shop in Brooklyn. The one minor difference in appearance between the two overhauls was that many cars of the Coney Island version featured the original blue <b>door</b> <b>indicator</b> lights at the ends of the cars, whereas these lights were removed from the Morrison-Knudsen rebuilds. Coney Island cars retained original Westinghouse XM829 master controllers in their cabs.|$|E
50|$|Also in 1992, a new engine, a 3.0 L Vulcan V6, was {{introduced}} as optional on the GL and LX, and standard on the GLS. 1992 {{would be the}} last year of the GLS, as it was discontinued (along with its Topaz counterpart) in 1993. This left Tempo with only two trim level options, GL and LX. 1992 also brought about a slightly redesigned gauge cluster, with tachometers now reading up to 7,000 RPM instead of the previous 6,000 RPM. Also, a fuel <b>door</b> <b>indicator</b> was added to the fuel gauge (an arrow pointing {{to the side of the}} car where the fuel door was located). 1992 was the only year for US models to have an available 120 MPH speedometer (GLS, XR5 and LTS models only); all other model years read to 85 MPH. 1994 was the last model year for the Ford Tempo (and Mercury Topaz). Production halted in the first quarter of 1994.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} facets of the OCESS is the leadership experience it provides for its members. The club is entirely student-run by three commanders: the Mission Commander, the Education Commander, and the Engineering Commander. The Mission Commander is in charge of everything relating to the mission, the Education Commander is in charge of everything relation to Planetariums and EEPs, and the Engineering Commander is in charge of designing any habitat systems, such as <b>door</b> <b>indicators,</b> phone circuitry, or power systems. The Mission is assisted by the Mission Subcommander, who serves as an Executive Officer, and the Education Commander is assisted by the Planetarium Commander. Ranked below the commanders are the Directors. These consist of the Quartermaster, {{who is in charge of}} storage, and the Webmaster, who is in charge of the Spacesim Website. The Webmaster assigns members to the Wiki Task Force, which is headed by the Wikimaster, who is also a Director.|$|R
50|$|The {{first of}} a new fleet of E235 series 11-car EMUs was {{introduced}} on the line on 30 November 2015, {{but a number of}} technical faults, including problems with <b>door</b> close <b>indicators,</b> resulted in the train being taken out of service the same day. The E235 series returned to service on the Yamanote Line on 7 March 2016. The E235 series trains are intended to ultimately replace the E231 series fleet by 2020.|$|R
50|$|Facelift models {{featured}} a redesigned {{front and rear}} bumper with rounded fog lights, a silver painted grill (instead of black), body-colour painted side-skirts and <b>door</b> handles, <b>indicators</b> now integrated into the wing mirrors, a restyled steering wheel, and the position for the trunk latch release was moved from {{the right side of}} the trunk, to above the license plate. Newly designed sport seats with better support was added in facelift models, after initial customer complaints that the original seats were too uncomfortable.|$|R
50|$|Like Mark I trains, Mark II {{vehicles}} are fully accessible, with dedicated spaces for wheelchair users, strollers, and bicycles. The first-generation Mark II vehicles each have 41 seats and {{a capacity of}} 130 passengers, although trains have carried up to 150 passengers under crush load. The second-generation Mark II vehicles have fewer seats and wider aisles, providing more space for standees, wheelchairs, strollers, and bicycles; they have 33 seats and a total capacity of 145 passengers. The second-generation Mark II trains also feature interactive LED maps, more handlebars, and video cameras.There were 60 Mark II cars added in 2002 for the Millennium Line and ridership growth on the Expo Line. In November 2006, Bombardier won a contract to supply a further 34 ART Mark II cars with a bid of $113 million. These cars are painted in the new TransLink livery appearing on recent buses, and have new features such as light-up station maps, <b>door</b> <b>indicator</b> lights, and destination boards {{in the front and}} back windows of the train. These trains are manufactured and assembled in Sahagun, Mexico, and Thunder Bay, Ontario. An additional 14 ART Mark II cars have been ordered for delivery in early 2010. The first of these trains entered regular service on July 3, 2009.|$|E
50|$|During the {{investigation}} of the near-crash of Flight 96, U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators found that the DC-10's cargo door design was dangerously flawed. The door relied on a set of heavy steel hooks to secure it against the door frame. When the hooks were fully engaged, an outside lever on the cargo door could be depressed to drive a set of locking pins through the hooks to hold them in place. The NTSB investigation found {{that it was possible to}} close the outside lever without the hooks being fully engaged, and there would be no outward signs that the locking mechanism was not engaged; the cargo <b>door</b> <b>indicator</b> in the cockpit would still register the door as being secured without hooks and locking pins being in the closed position. This combination of factors caused Flight 96 to take off without its aft cargo door being fully locked. When the door blew out at altitude, the sudden decompression created a large pressure differential between the cabin above and the cargo bay below, causing the cabin floor to collapse. The collapse of the cabin floor severely damaged some of the vital flight control wires and hydraulic lines routed through the floor beams, which left the pilots with very limited control of the aircraft.|$|E
40|$|The "revolving door" {{phenomenon}} {{has become very}} common in most industrialised countries, and is leading to conflicts of interest {{as well as economic}} distortions. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to develop an indicator of the distortionary effects of the revolving door - The Revolving <b>Door</b> <b>Indicator</b> (RDI). By measuring the sectorial concentration of the revolving door, this indicator intends to proxy the distortions induced by rent-seeking firms.

25|$|It was {{concluded}} that the accident had been caused by the baggage door becoming lodged {{on the leading edge}} of the right tailplane after it had opened and detached. This changed the aircraft's aerodynamic characteristics so that it became uncontrollable. This in turn resulted in overstressing of the wings and tailplane leading to inflight structural failure, with both wings and tailplane detaching from the fuselage. Contributory factors were the mis-rigged state of the door operating mechanism, which allowed the top and bottom pairs of catches to lose synchronisation, and failure of the <b>door</b> warning <b>indicators</b> to give the crew enough time to respond to door safety alerts.|$|R

The short [...] "A" [...] chassis, with a 2980 mm wheelbase, underpinned the two-seater models: the Motorway Courier, and the 1936 Special Roadster which offered the highest performance. All models featured such advanced equipment as safety glass, hydraulic brakes, and a 12-volt electrical system sufficient to bear the load of the electric windscreen wipers, <b>door</b> locks, and <b>indicators.</b>|$|R
50|$|This final {{arrangement}} {{would enter}} into a pattern, that would hold until 2009. Any novelty would first be introduced in the 3102, would be then fitted to the 3110 (and 31105 after 2005). Changes would include body-coloured door handles, electronically regulated <b>door</b> mirrors with <b>indicator</b> lights and twin-torsion beam rear suspension, removal of the archaic kingpins from front suspension, and new engines such as the ZMZ-405 or licence built Chrysler DOHC and Steyr Diesels. In early 2009, after nearly 26 {{and a half years}} in assembly, the GAZ-3102 would be finally retired. A total of 155,850 cars were hand built over the period, including 27 thousand original Volgas with the ZMZ-4022 engines.|$|R
40|$|This {{aerial image}} of {{downtown}} Charleston has Meeting St. running diagonally across the picture plane. St. Michael’s Church (1752 - 61) is at center left, {{is significant because}} it is the oldest religious structure in the city. It was designed by an architect by the name of Gibson (Simons 2 ̆ 6 Lapham) and continues to be an active Episcopal church. Just up the street is the Fireproof Building, also known as the County Records Building. It was built in 1822 and is the country’s oldest surviving fireproof building. The architect, Robert Mills, relied primarily on removing combustible materials to make the building fireproof. It features stairwells lit by a central skylight. Some of the buildings plans were altered on site by John Spidle, the construction architect. Across the street is Hibernian Hall (1840), which was used in the Democratic Convention of 1860. The front of the building features and Ionic portico with a gilded Irish harp over the <b>door,</b> and <b>indicator</b> of the Hibernian Society’s original function as a group to aid Irish imigrants. On the horizon, just before the harbor, is the Fort Sumter Hotel, completed in the 1920 s as a luxury hotel and later turned into residential housing. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Telecommunications {{technology}} is extremely rapid technological development today, for example, that is: {{one of the}} RFID identification technology that is widely used today. RFID is a tiny devices called tags or transponders (transmitter + transponder). RFID tags will know automatically when it detects a signal from the reader (RFID reader) compatible. Each tag has the different information from each other. RFID can also collaborated with other devices or with the application programs that exist today such as Delphi. Delphi is a tool windows based application developers. This software is widely used for such things handle various mathematical applications, games and databases.

40|$|Considering {{availability}} {{purposes for}} train transportation, passenger accesses (doors and steps) are often designated as critical systems. To improve global availability of its rolling stock, Bombardier Transportation (BT) aims at reinforcing its maintenance procedure by introducing predictive diagnosis. The SURFER {{project has been}} initiated to develop online and in-cars tools to early detect and prevent faults. In this paper, an overview of achieved progress with respect to online predictive diagnosis will be introduced. For this purpose, many signals are recorded using a test bench by BT: electrical motor intensity current, <b>door</b> displacement, binary <b>indicators</b> as <b>door</b> closed and locked. The paper focuses on designing a semi-Supervised discriminative probabilistic model that take into account contextual variables (train inclination or constraints due to passengers affluence) to perform a robust predictive diagnosis. The main steps of the proposed method are the followings: the segmentation of the provided signals into opening and closing phases, the extraction of relevant features from opening/closing phases, {{the setting of the}} discriminative diagnosis model based on statistical semi-supervised learning. The proposed approach is tested on signals collected from regional trains fleeting around Paris. It allows the earlier detection of anomalies, for instance, those due to maladjustments. The practical implementation of this approach will be detailed together with its preliminary results...|$|R
