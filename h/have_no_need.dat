5|$|Most Hydrophiinae are {{completely}} aquatic and {{have adapted to}} their environments in many ways, the most characteristic {{of which is a}} paddle-like tail that has improved their swimming ability. To a varying degree, the bodies of many species are laterally compressed, especially in the pelagic species. This has often caused the ventral scales to become reduced in size, even difficult to distinguish from the adjoining scales. Their lack of ventral scales means they have become virtually helpless on land, but as they live out their entire lifecycles at sea, they <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> to leave the water.|$|E
5|$|At {{the other}} extreme, the striped {{burrowing}} frog (Cyclorana alboguttata) regularly aestivates during the hot, dry season in Australia, surviving in a dormant state {{without access to}} food and water for nine or ten months of the year. It burrows underground and curls up inside a protective cocoon formed by its shed skin. Researchers at the University of Queensland have found that during aestivation, the metabolism of the frog is altered and the operational efficiency of the mitochondria is increased. This means that the limited amount of energy available to the comatose frog is used in a more efficient manner. This survival mechanism is only useful to animals that remain completely unconscious {{for an extended period}} of time and whose energy requirements are low because they are cold-blooded and <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> to generate heat. Other research showed that, to provide these energy requirements, muscles atrophy, but hind limb muscles are preferentially unaffected. Frogs have been found to have upper critical temperatures of around 41 degrees Celsius.|$|E

25|$|I cannot {{understand}} why we idle discussing religion. If we are honest—and scientists have to be—we must admit that religion is a jumble of false assertions, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God {{is a product of}} the human imagination. It is quite understandable why primitive people, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling. But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> for such solutions. I can't for the life of me see how the postulate of an Almighty God helps us in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and all the other horrors He might have prevented. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some of us want to keep the lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit. Religion is a kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards—in heaven if not on earth—all those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of all mortal sins.|$|E
25|$|Sheep are {{sometimes}} eaten in considerable numbers, {{especially in the}} Inner and Outer Hebrides of Scotland (25.9% and 26.8% of nest remains respectively). Differentiating whether a lamb has been caught and killed while alive or scavenged as a carcass is possible if the remains are in good condition. In one examination of 10 such remains in nests in Scotland, {{it was found that}} 3 lambs had been taken alive and 7 after they had died. This suggests the majority of lambs are taken as carrion, which is reinforced by the fact that much ungulate carrion found around active nest sites in Scotland is already in a malodorous and putrid state. Domestic goats (Capra aegagrus hircus) are occasionally predated as well. Goats slightly outnumbered sheep in the diet of eagles breeding on Corsica, with both domesticated animals making up 20.5% of the diet there and being the most important food source. In North America, lambs and goats were found to comprise less than 1.4% of all prey items. In Montana, it was found that most predation on lambs by golden eagles was committed by juvenile eagles or eagles that failed to breed (which <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> to carry prey to a nest). There {{it was found that the}} hunting of domestic stock peaks during wet, cold springs that seemed to adversely effect the local abundance of jackrabbits. Pigs (including feral and domestic varieties) are occasionally taken, especially in insular populations. Studies showed pigs (most certainly taken as carrion) made up to 13.3% of the diet in Corsica and 43.1% on Santa Cruz Island, California. Few wild pigs co-exist with golden eagles but wild boar (Sus scrofa) (likely only as piglets or carrion) have been taken in Bulgaria.|$|E
25|$|Assembling the {{suspects}} together along with Carla, Poirot makes his denouement about the murder. Although Phillip's hostility to Caroline {{was due to}} her rejection of his love for her, and Meredith's sympathy was due to his weariness for his long affection for her, leading him to form an attachment to Elsa that was unreciprocated, both brothers' emotions were merely red herrings. In putting together the case, he reveals that Caroline had been innocent, but did not defend herself in court, because she believed that Angela had committed the murder; the evidence Poirot had uncovered showed that her younger sister had been angry with Amyas and had put salt in his glass as a prank. She {{had the opportunity to}} steal the poison from Meredith {{on the morning of the}} crime, and was seen fiddling with the bottle of beer that Caroline would take down to him. However, Caroline did not wish her sister to be charged for the crime, having felt a deep guilt for injuring her sister in a fit of jealous rage many years ago, which had left Angela blinded in one eye and with a permanent scar on the left side of her face. Therefore, she took steps to take the blame for her crime in order to earn redemption, which explained why she did not claim she was innocent in the letter she sent Angela but believed Angela knew Caroline was. However, Poirot reveals that Caroline's actions had actually proved her innocence, as she had wiped the fingerprints off the bottle because she believed that the poison had been put in it rather than in the glass, and that she would <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> to remove her own--thus, she was removing those of a third party. Furthermore, he reveals that Angela was not the killer, as she had been at Meredith's lab in order to steal valerian from him in preparation for playing another prank on Amyas, but never carried out the act because of the murder, deducing this from the way that she spoke of the theft in the future tense to Poirot.|$|E
