5|$|Age of Empires (under {{the working}} title Dawn of Man) {{was the first}} game {{developed}} by Ensemble Studios. Its historical setting was chosen to be more plausible and accessible, particularly to casual gamers, than existing games. At the time, other real-time strategy games had science fiction and fantasy settings, so the historical setting of Age of Empires enabled it to stand out. The designers received much of their inspiration from the game Civilization, with its proven historical setting; this was noted among reviewers as something positive. Age of Empires was designed by Bruce Shelley, Tony Goodman (<b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game's artwork), and Dave Pottinger (<b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game's artificial intelligence). Stephen Rippy was the music director (a role he kept through the series), with occasional help from his brother, David Rippy, as well as Kevin McMullan. He created the original music in Age of Empires using sounds from actual instruments from the periods in the game, {{as well as their}} digital samples. The tunes were the result of extensive research on the cultures, styles, and instruments used.|$|E
