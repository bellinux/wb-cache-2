In the passage, Romeo laments to Juliet" [...] a name, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>not</b> how to tell who I am. My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself, because it is an enemy to thee.

[...] Dalton feared that by remaining sealed to Charles, she would forfeit her claim to her children. Perhaps because Charles was a drinker, her [...] "brethren" [...] considered him unworthy of his sealing. Her sealing cancellation was approved in 1887 and then revoked after her death in 1931.|$|E
500|$|In May 1836 Bennett {{travelled}} to Düsseldorf in {{the company}} of Davison to attend the Lower Rhenish Music Festival for the first performance of Mendelssohn's oratorio St Paul. Bennett's visit was enabled by a subsidy by the piano-making firm of John Broadwood & Sons. Inspired by his journey up the Rhine, Bennett began work on his overture The Naiads (Op. 15). After Bennett left for home, Mendelssohn wrote to their mutual friend, the English organist and composer Thomas Attwood, [...] "I think him the most promising young musician <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>not</b> only in your country but also here, and I am convinced if he does not become a very great musician, it is not God's will, but his own".|$|E
500|$|Congress had {{appointed}} General Lee {{to command}} the Continental Army troops in the southern colonies, and his movements by land shadowed those of Clinton's fleet as it sailed south. Lee wrote from Wilmington on June 1 that the fleet had sailed, but {{that he did not}} know whether it was sailing for Virginia or South Carolina. He headed for Charleston, saying [...] " [...] confess <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>not</b> whether I shall go to or from the enemy." [...] He arrived in Charleston shortly after the fleet anchored outside the harbor, and took command of the city's defenses. He immediately ran into a problem: the South Carolina troops (militia or the colonial regiments) were not on the Continental line, and thus not formally under his authority. Some South Carolina troops resisted his instructions, and Rutledge had to intervene by proclaiming Lee in command of all South Carolina forces.|$|E

500|$|From the mid-1850s, Emily's mother became {{effectively}} bedridden {{with various}} chronic illnesses {{until her death}} in 1882. Writing to a friend in summer 1858, Emily {{said that she would}} visit if she could leave [...] "home, or mother. I do not go out at all, lest father will come and miss me, or miss some little act, which I might forget, should I run away– Mother is much as usual. <b>I</b> <b>Know</b> <b>not</b> what to hope of her". As her mother continued to decline, Dickinson's domestic responsibilities weighed more heavily upon her and she confined herself within the Homestead. Forty years later, Lavinia stated that because their mother was chronically ill, one of the daughters had to remain always with her. Emily took this role as her own, and [...] "finding the life with her books and nature so congenial, continued to live it".|$|E
500|$|The first {{critical}} review of Very's book {{was written by}} Margaret Fuller and published in Orestes Brownson's Boston Quarterly Review; it said Very's poems had [...] "an elasticity of spirit, a genuine flow of thought, and unsought nobleness and purity", though she admitted she preferred the prose in the collection over the poetry. She mocked the [...] "sing song" [...] style of the poems and questioned his religious mission. She concluded: [...] "I am... greatly interested in Mr Very. He seems worthy to be well known." [...] James Freeman Clarke admired Very's poetry enough to have several published in his journal, the Western Messenger, between 1838 and 1840. William Ellery Channing admired Very's poetry as well, writing that his insanity [...] "is only superficial". Richard Henry Dana Sr. also commented positively on Very's poetry: [...] "The thought is deeply spiritual; and {{while there is a}} certain character of peculiarity which we so often find in like things from our old writers, there is a freedom from quaintness... Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>not</b> where you would... find any thing in this country to compare with these Sonnets." ...|$|E
500|$|As the {{examination}} continued, Aylmer considered {{the ability of}} the Anglican Church to put trained ministers in every parish. [...] He barked, [...] "This fellow would have a preacher in every parish church!" [...] to which Marbury replied, [...] "so would St. Paul." [...] Then Aylmer asked, [...] "But where is the living for them?" [...] To this Marbury answered, [...] "A man might cut a large thong out of your hide, and that of the other prelates, and it would never be missed." [...] Having lost his patience, the bishop retorted, [...] "Thou are an overthwart, proud, puritan knave." [...] Marbury answered, [...] "I am no puritan. [...] I beseech you to be good to me. [...] I have been twice in prison already, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>not</b> why. [...] To this, Aylmer was unsympathetic, and he rendered the sentence, [...] "Have him to the Marshalsea. [...] There he shall cope with the papists." [...] Marbury then actually threatened divine retribution upon the bishop by warning him to beware the judgements of God. [...] His daughter Anne would make a similar threat towards the magistrates and ministers at her civil trial before the Massachusetts Court, nearly 60 years later.|$|E

500|$|In October 1562 the Queen {{fell ill}} with {{smallpox}} and, believing {{her life to}} be in danger, she asked the Privy Council to make Robert Dudley Protector of the Realm and {{to give him a}} suitable title together with twenty thousand pounds a year. There was universal relief when she recovered her health; Dudley was made a privy councillor. He was already deeply involved in foreign politics, including Scotland. In 1563 Elizabeth suggested Dudley as a consort to the widowed Mary, Queen of Scots, the idea being to achieve firm amity between England and Scotland and diminish the influence of foreign powers. Elizabeth's preferred solution was that they should all live together at the English court, so that she would not have to forgo her favourite's company. Mary of Scotland at first enquired if Elizabeth was serious, wanting above all to know her chances of inheriting the English crown. Elizabeth repeatedly declared that she was only prepared to acknowledge Mary as her heir on condition that she marry Robert Dudley. Mary's Protestant advisors warmed to the prospect of having Dudley as their prince, and in September 1564 he was created Earl of Leicester, a move designed to make him more acceptable to Mary. In January 1565 Thomas Randolph, the English ambassador to Scotland, was told by the Scottish queen that she would accept the proposal. To his amazement, Dudley was not to be moved to comply: But a man of that nature I never found any ... he whom I go about to make as happy as ever was any, to put him in possession of a kingdom, to lay in his naked arms a most fair ... lady ... nothing regardeth the good that shall ensue unto him thereby ... but so uncertainly dealeth that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>not</b> where to find him. Dudley indeed had made it clear to the Scots at the beginning that he was not a candidate for Mary's hand and forthwith had behaved with passive resistance. He also worked in the interest of Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, Mary's eventual choice of husband. Elizabeth herself wavered as to declaring Mary her heir, until in March 1565 she decided she could not bring herself to it. Still, she finally told the Spanish ambassador that the proposal fell through because the Earl of Leicester refused to cooperate.|$|E

He attributed some to an actor, Robert Cox, who had published his own drolls, and probably performed them at the Red Bull Theatre, and outside London.|$|E
2500|$|Paul's Second Epistle to the Corinthians is more {{generally}} agreed {{to refer to}} the astral planes; [...] "I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago, (whether in the body <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>not,</b> or out of the body <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>not,</b> God knows) such a one caught up to the third heaven..."
