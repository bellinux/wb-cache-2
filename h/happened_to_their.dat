5|$|In 2014, Nesbitt had {{the lead}} role as the father {{character}} Tony Hughes in harrowing BBC drama series The Missing, alongside Frances O'Connor (as his wife/ex-wife, Emily Hughes/Walsh) and Tchéky Karyo (as Julien Baptiste, leading French police investigator). The drama focused on a British married couple, whose son goes missing while they are on holiday in France, and the subsequent years of enquiry trying to find answers as to what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> son and why. Incidentally, Nesbitt and Karyo had appeared previously together in the Martin Sheen film The Way (2010).|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Stafford and Cernan, still {{circling}} in {{the clouds}} in the second T-38, {{had no idea what}} had <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> flight partners. Air traffic controllers were confused by the two planes in flight attempting different abort actions after the initial missed approach, and moreover no one on the ground knew who was in the crashed plane. After some delay, Stafford and Cernan were asked to identify themselves and given permission to land, but they were not informed of the crash until on the ground. Although personally distraught over the loss of his close colleagues and friends, Stafford acted as NASA's chief contact on the scene until other personnel arrived to relieve him later in the day.|$|E

25|$|Private Eye {{does not}} publish {{explicit}} details of individuals concerned with its upkeep, {{and does not}} contain a list of its editors, writers and designers. In 1981 the book The Private Eye Story stated that the owners were Peter Cook, who owned most of the shareholding, with smaller shareholders including Dirk Bogarde, Jane Asher, and several of those involved with {{the founding of the}} magazine. Most of those on the list have since died, however, and it is unclear what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> shareholdings.

25|$|Paul seizes this {{opportunity}} to give his sister a baby in a storyline that becomes known as the baby switch. He drugs Babe, puts her in a helicopter, and stages a helicopter crash near a river in the forest. When Babe awakens, Paul tells her that the helicopter crashed and her baby is dead. She loses consciousness again. When Adam Chandler and JR arrive at the scene and threaten Paul, should anything bad have <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> heir, Paul twists his story around and tells them that it was Bianca's baby that fell into the river and that Babe's child survived. JR's family is elated that Babe's baby is alive, but Bianca's family is devastated by the news. In Llanview, Paul gives Kelly Babe's son (later known as Adam Chandler III, then Little Adam, and currently AJ), telling her that the boy's mother was a poor homeless woman {{who did not want}} a baby.|$|E
25|$|A 13-year-old {{junior high}} school student from Niigata, Megumi Yokota, was kidnapped by North Korea on November 15, 1977. In {{addition}} to her, many other Japanese citizens were kidnapped by North Korean agents. In 2002, North Korea admitted to kidnapping 13 Japanese citizens during the 1970s and 1980s, {{in order to train}} spies to infiltrate U.S. military installations in Japan. Five people have been released, but the North Korean government claimed that there were eight dead. Japan has pressed for the return of the bodies. However, the Japanese government believes that there are still kidnapped Japanese citizens being held captive in North Korea. North Korea's official statement is that the issue has been settled. Because of the overwhelming number of South Koreans also kidnapped by North Korea, there have been some joint efforts by South Korea and Japan to retrieve their citizens. The issue remains unresolved, however Japan has insisted on an explanation of what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> citizens as a precondition for normalizing relations with North Korea.|$|E
25|$|In summer 1985, Ballard was {{aboard the}} French {{research}} ship Le Suroît, which {{was using the}} side scan sonar SAR {{to search for the}} Titanics wreck. When the French ship was recalled, he transferred onto a ship from Woods Hole, the R/V Knorr. Unbeknownst to some, this trip was financed by the U.S. Navy for secret reconnaissance of the wreckage of two Navy nuclear powered attack submarines, the USS Scorpion and the USS Thresher, which sank in the 1960s, and not for the Titanic. Back in 1982, he approached the Navy about his new deep sea underwater robot craft, the Argo, and his search for the Titanic. The Navy was not interested in financing it. However, they were interested in finding out what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> missing submarines and ultimately concluded that Argo was their best chance to do so. The Navy agreed it would finance his Titanic search only if he first searched for and investigated the two sunken submarines, and found out the state of their nuclear reactors after being submerged for such a long time, and whether their radioactivity was impacting the environment. He was placed on temporary active duty in the Navy, in charge of finding and investigating the wrecks. After the two missions were completed, time and funding permitting, he was free to use resources to hunt for the Titanic.|$|E

500|$|Because {{the episode}} was {{originally}} {{planned to be}} {{in the first half of}} the series, many of the reviewers mentioned that it was strange that Amy and Rory did not comment upon what had happened previously, such as what had <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> child.

500|$|... "Burn" [...] was {{considered}} a [...] "window to Usher's inner thoughts", along with the controversial track [...] "Confessions" [...] and [...] "Confessions Part II". The song is about breakups and ending relationships. According to Matt Cibula of Popmatters, [...] "Burn" [...] is constructed from [...] "two-step concept". In the lyrics [...] "You know that it's over / You {{know that it was}} through / Let it burn / Got to let it burn", Usher breaks up with his woman but found her sad about feeling bad about what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> relationship. However, Usher says that she must deal with it before she can accept the truth. For the lines [...] "It's been fifty-eleven days / Umpteen hours / I'm gonna be burnin' / Till you return", the direction changes after Usher realized that breaking up with her was a huge mistake and that he wanted her back.|$|E
500|$|From Dust has {{the option}} of two main game modes, one being the Story mode, the other a Challenge mode. The former {{consists}} of a sequence of missions which play through {{the story of a}} lost tribe who are using the player (who controls [...] "The Breath") to travel to different levels in an attempt to discover what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> old tribe. By helping the tribe to find the different totems scattered on a map, they can begin constructing their village next to the totem. Players can also send tribespeople to look for magical stones, which will grant them the ability to manipulate the world, by repelling water and fire for example. When the tribe successfully builds villages next to every totem, a portal will open and the player can proceed into the next map. These maps become more and more challenging as players progress. New elements, such as trees that erupt in fire, and plants that explode, are introduced in later levels.|$|E

500|$|On the June 5, 2006 {{episode of}} Raw, Haas {{inadvertently}} knocked Lilian Garcia off the ring apron {{as he was}} entering the ring. It was announced on WWE's official website that as a result, Garcia suffered a sprained wrist. As {{a result of the}} legitimate accident, Haas began a feud with Garcia's onetime storyline love interest Viscera. Haas made advances towards Garcia, at one point forcefully kissing her and then dropping her to the ground. Haas and Viscera continued to fight for Garcia's affection in the ring, until she told them both that she wanted to be [...] "just friends". Haas gave Viscera an eye rake in anger, and a blinded Viscera accidentally gave Garcia a Samoan drop. Though it was unintentional, when both Haas and Viscera had seen what had <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> now former love interest, they simply had a laugh about it, thus making Haas a villain. After that, Viscera and Haas became a tag team, competing on both Raw and Heat until splitting in December 2006.|$|E
500|$|Another quandary {{is that if}} the precogs' visions are infallible {{then the}} future cannot be otherwise, while if they are {{incorrect}} people will be punished for crimes they will never commit. Kowalski contends that the precogs only attain knowledge of what he calls the [...] "conditional future". He cites as evidence two examples: the scene where Agatha steers Anderton through the mall by foreseeing dangerous events and helping him circumnavigate them, and a later scene where she tells Anderton and his ex-wife what would have <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> child if he had lived. In the first example, Agatha knows what Anderton will freely choose to do when presented with specific facts so she provides them to him, and, in the second, she knows what will have happened to the Anderton's son based on specific scenarios throughout his life, in which she can see what he would have freely chosen to do, and what selections various people in his life would have freely made. According to Kowalski, the PreCrime unit therefore removes individuals from precise situations where they would freely choose to become a murderer.|$|E

He had diligently prepared himself for the introduction to Manning by reading her works, and felt that her book The Wind Changes showed [...] "signs of genius".

When he borrowed a half-crown from her on their first meeting, and repaid it the next day, he knew they would marry. Manning was less certain of the relationship, but Reggie quickly moved into her flat, proposing in bed a few weeks later. They were married at Marylebone Registry Office on 18August 1939, with Stevie Smith and Louis MacNeice as witnesses. The bridegroom, unconventionally and true to form, did not produce a ring for the ceremony. A few days after the wedding, the couple received word that Reggie had been recalled to Bucharest. They left within a matter of hours; Manning later wrote to Stevie Smith from Romania asking her to find out what had <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> flat and {{to take care of her}} books while she was away.|$|E
