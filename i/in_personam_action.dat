50|$|Justice Jackson {{began his}} {{examination}} of {{the issues of the}} case by discussing the nature of the jurisdiction which the Surrogate's Court was exercising. He explained some of the differences in the service of process required in in rem, quasi in rem, and in personam actions. Mullane had argued that this was essentially an <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> <b>action,</b> and that the Surrogate could not exercise jurisdiction on out-of-state residents upon whom personal service had not been made.|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of interpleader {{depends upon the}} availability of injunctions against other proceedings. There is no congressional authorization of such injunctions for rule interpleader cases. If interpleader were an in rem action, {{one of the other}} exceptions to the Anti-Injunction Act might save the day, but the Supreme Court has apparently foreclosed that option. This article examines that three-sided conflict. Part II discusses the problem in greater depth, focusing first on how interpleader functions and why it depends on being “the only game in town. ” Part II next addresses the background and interpretation of the Anti-Injunction Act, exploring particularly the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s narrow interpretation the Act 2 ̆ 7 s provisions and discussing the federalism values that the Act and the Court seek to serve. Finally, Part II reviews interpleader 2 ̆ 7 s status as an <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> <b>action.</b> Even in setting out the problem, one can conceive of at least three potential solutions. One might simply acknowledge that injunctions are not available in rule interpleader actions. Alternatively, one might reverse the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s view of interpleader as an <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> <b>action,</b> recharacterizing it as in rem to get around the strictures of the Anti-Injunction Act. Finally, one might leave interpleader itself untouched but reinterpret the jurisdiction exception to the Anti-Injunction Act. Unfortunately, each of these solutions comes with an unpalatable price. Part III discusses the price of each solution. Part IV considers whether, despite the costs of each solution, Congress or the Court should adopt any of them or whether there is some other alternative. In fact, there are two alternatives. Recharacterizing interpleader as an in rem proceeding to fit it within the Anti-Injunction Act is possible, though not the best answer because it would require extended judicial effort to refine the courts 2 ̆ 7 jurisdictional treatment of in rem proceedings generally. This approach is anything but simple and easy to implement. The more elegant option is for Congress explicitly to authorize injunctions against state proceedings in rule interpleader actions, and Part IV offers language that does so...|$|E

An action with respect to a bareboat ship will frequently encounter this problem.|$|R
25|$|By {{the time}} of the rediscovery of the Roman law in Europe in the 12th and 13th centuries, the common law had already {{developed}} far enough to prevent a Roman law reception as it occurred on the continent. However, the first common law scholars, most notably Glanvill and Bracton, as well as the early royal common law judges, had been well accustomed with Roman law. Often, they were clerics trained in the Roman canon law. One of the first and throughout its history {{one of the most significant}} treatises of the common law, Bracton's De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae (On the Laws and Customs of England), was heavily influenced by the division of the law in Justinian's Institutes. The impact of Roman law had decreased sharply after the age of Bracton, but the Roman divisions of actions into in rem (typically, actions against a thing or property for the purpose of gaining title to that property; must be filed in a court where the property is located) and <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> (typically, <b>actions</b> directed against a person; these can affect a person's rights and, since a person often owns things, his property too) used by Bracton had a lasting effect and laid the groundwork for a return of Roman law structural concepts in the 18th and 19th centuries. Signs of this can be found in Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England, and Roman law ideas regained importance with the revival of academic law schools in the 19th century. As a result, today, the main systematic divisions of the law into property, contract, and tort (and to some extent unjust enrichment) can be found in the civil law as well as in the common law.|$|R

40|$|This Article takes a {{fresh look}} at the power of courts and {{creditors}} to force debtors to repay their obligations through <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> collection techniques. Variously known as “debtor’s examinations,” “turnover orders,” “citations to discover assets,” “supplementary proceedings,” “proceedings supplementary,” and “proceedings in aid of execution,” <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> remedies force the debtor, under threat of the court’s contempt authority, to turn over money or property directly to a creditor. Because the exercise of the court’s contempt authority can result in a debtor’s imprisonment, <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> techniques have long been regarded as a critical but potentially very coercive arrow in a debt collector’s quiver. Recently, the Federal Trade Commission and others have endorsed major changes to a debt collection system labeled as “broken. ” These reform proposals, however, have overlooked key problems <b>in</b> <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> proceedings, where excessive creditor leverage and insufficient protection of debtors’ procedural rights risk validating a view that the judicial system is functioning as creditors’ private collection arm. Following the transfer of power to a newly established Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, this Article resurrects a subject that has received virtually no attention in the scholarly literature for over a decade. It analyzes the particular features of <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> proceedings and debtor behavior that contribute to a longstanding imbalance in the leverage asserted by creditors over debtors. The Article recommends specific changes to the way courts conduct <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> proceedings to ensure that the in terrorem effects of these remedies do not upend important social policies, including the protection of exempt property and the adjudicative fairness of the collection process. Debt collection is a fundamental component of the consumer credit system. The strength and legitimacy of its procedures, however, depend on maintaining a difficult balance between the state’s and creditors’ interest in rigorous judgment enforcement and debtors’ interest in imposing reasonable limitations on the coerciveness of debt collection...|$|R

With respect to each institution, we generally find that <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> relations are governed by flexible default rules; in rem relations are governed by bright-line rules that impose immutable and standardized obligations; intermediate relations, as befits their intermediate level of information costs, feature a type and degree of standardization beyond pure contract but short of pure property...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} {{facet of}} a court's jurisdiction in common law countries is the court's <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> jurisdiction {{under which the}} court is able to adjudicate a dispute involving a defendant present or resident within the court's territorial limits.

50|$|The {{principles}} {{relating to}} the rule huur gaar voor koop were discussed.

Consequently, if during the currency of the lease the lessor alienated the leased property in terms of, say, a contract of sale, the purchaser (and new owner) was not bound to recognise the lessees rights of occupation under the lease, unless he had undertaken to do so.|$|R

40|$|Within the {{equitable}} jurisdiction, {{the phrase}} <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> {{has been used}} to describe the means of enforcement of the equitable decree, the justification for equitable jurisdiction generally, and the mechanism by which chancery rulings effectively override the common law.

In the discourse on rights, it is used to distinguish personal from property rights. <b>In</b> <b>personam</b> reasoning <b>in</b> the equitable sense has been used historically to justify the assumption of jurisdiction in disputes relating to foreign immovable property, and the application of the principles of equity of the forum without reference to choice of law.

5000|$|To {{understand}} the principles in this case, one must understand {{a little about}} quasi in rem actions and jurisdictional principles at the time.

However, if a defendant, on whom <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> jurisdiction was unable to be asserted, owned property {{in the state in}} which plaintiff was situated, plaintiff could [...] "attach" [...] to the action whatever property defendant owned in that state. Such an action was labeled quasi-in rem and, when this occurred, state courts were permitted to assert jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant on any matter, with the limitation that any remedy be limited to involving only the attached property.|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on the {{maturing}} of the <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> claim, and its relationship with the concepts of supervening fraud and landlocked land. The paper concentrates solely on the enforcement of the claim against the class of registered owners and uses two decisions concerning a sub‐set of that class — the access‐blocking owner — to tease out the principles. The claim will supersede supervening fraud, a principle that may be neither 'necessary [nor] consistent with the statute'. The circumstances in which claims <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> are, and will be, recognised are wide. This paper highlights well‐established known legal or equitable causes of action to which the unconscionability of a registered owner may attach. The claim's relationship with ss 326 ‐ 331 of the Property Law Act 2007 adds a further dimension to the debate. So how do the parties fare under the three concepts? Both the Suttons and the McGraths clear the hurdles of supervening fraud and the <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> claim. Had they resided in New Zealand, the McGraths would probably have successfully defended a landlocked land application from the Campbells. However, Mr O'Kane would have dealt his winning card and, pursuant to ss 326 ‐ 330 of the Property Law Act 2007, his access would have been reinstated. A tricky trio indeed...|$|R
