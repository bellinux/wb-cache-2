40|$|The “stock” {{concept is}} {{fundamental}} to fisheries management. To manage a fishery responsibly {{it is important to}} understand its stock structure and how fishing effort and mortality are distributed (Begg e Waldman, 1999). The failure to comply the true stock structure and the ineffective fisheries management of an exploited species can lead to overfishing and depletion of the stock (Begg et al., 1999 a). In the last years, scientific community has pointed out that the most successful way to address stock identification studies is the application of a holistic approach, thus involving a broad selection of complementary techniques (Begg et al., 1999 a; Abaunza, 2008 a; Cadrin et al., 2013). The European hake (Merluccius merluccius, Linnaeus 1758) represents a basic component of the demersal communities and one of the target species in the Mediterranean Sea (Lo Brutto et al., 2004; Ligas et al., 2011). For this reason it has been extensively studied. Furthermore, hake stocks are generally considered over-exploited both in the Atlantic Ocean (ICES, 2011; 2012) and in the Mediterranean Sea (STECF, 2013; GFCM, 2014). At present, European hake populations in the Mediterranean Sea are managed considering several relatively small geographical sub-areas (GSAs), which are identified mainly on the basis of political considerations (Ragonese et al., 2012; Vittori et al., 2013). In this partition, Sardinian seas are represented by GSAs 11. 1 and 11. 2 and are split between two <b>FAO</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>Divisions</b> (Balearic Islands and Sardinia). It is known that the complexity of many marine species stocks is often underestimated in modern stock management processes (Begg et al., 1999 a). As regards the Mediterranean sea, various studies suggested a geographical distribution of the stocks that appears considerably different from the current management units partition (Abaunza et al., 2000; Abaunza et al., 2008 c; Murta et al., 2008), and this fact have been observed also for the European hake (Castillo et al., 2004; Mattiucci et al., 2004; Tanner et al., 2012; Fiorentino et al., 2014). The need of the achievement of a comprehensive knowledge about the stock structure of a commercially important species like M. merluccius, has led to the development of this study, which aims, through the employment of a multidisciplinary approach, at a better geographical definition of this species stock in the waters around Sardinia. A first insight into the complexity of the European hake population in the area has been supplied by the analysis and comparison of its length structure in the western and eastern coasts of Sardinia, showing a degree of differentiation that has been subsequently deepened through the application of various techniques. The analysis of the variability in the growth of the species hasn’t indicated a meaningful differentiation of the populations in the two sides of the island, but has suggested that the presence of many spawning areas in the western coast could be the cause of the difference in the 0 age-class mean length obtained, as well as in the length structure above-mentioned. On the contrary, the implementation of a geometric morphometric technique to study the shape of individuals has led to the discovery of a significant, even though of moderate extent, differentiation between the two coasts. However, as remarked by Tudela (1999) and Levi et al. (2004) in other case-studies, these differences were believed to be linked only to environmental influences, without a connection to those biological parameters that are fundamental in the definition of a stock. This hypothesis has been made also considering that the observed difference in shape didn’t seem to affect individuals’ growth. Lastly, the parasitological exam of specimens collected in the whole area of Sardinian seas, has supported the hypothesis of homogeneity of the populations in the area. Indeed, no significant differences have been found in the relative abundance and prevalence of the various parasite taxa examined. Comparing these results with those obtained in a similar study carried out in the Mediterranean Sea (Mattiucci et al., 2004) it has been possible to highlight a considerable similarity of our study area with the central area of Mediterranean sea, and, conversely, a clear differentiation between Sardinian seas and the eastern part of Mediterranean basin. Similar considerations has been made in the context of StockMed project (Fiorentino et al., 2014). This study has therefore provided a solid evidence of the homogeneity of the European hake stock in the waters around Sardinia, leading to the conclusion that this population should be managed jointly. Moreover, it has supported the recently expressed opinion that its stock (as well as those of other important species) could be wider than expected, underlining the need of improving current management units boundaries...|$|E

Geographical variation for shelf-dependent resources is explained by dividing <b>FAO</b> <b>Statistical</b> Areas into three categories: Arcto-boreal regions in the northern hemisphere, with five-year mean fishery production peaking at 2. 1 – 2. 7 tons per km 2; from the Antarc-tic convergence to south-boreal latitudes, with production peaking at 0. 5 – 2. 2 tons per km 2, and tropical/subtropical shelves, peaking at 0. 4 – 0. 9 tons per km 2 (except for the Central East Atlantic). For zoogeographically similar areas, overall production levels for shelf-dependent resources have generally reached similar peak values and declined re-cently in areas with long histories of fishing.

This paper provides and overview of the major components of the proposed <b>FAO</b> <b>Statistical</b> data quality assessment and monitoring framework and the integration of it into the statistical process. Since the early 1990 ’s, the FAO Statistics Division has been developing data quality frameworks and concepts relating to agricultural statistics. The initial work outlined in the paper by Trant (1993), focused on the concepts of accuracy, relevance and timeliness of a statistical estimate. It also discussed the need for sound statistical metadata in order for the user to be able to interpret the statistics. This approach was primarily aimed at national statistical offices and the need to make them accountable for data they publish. More recently, the FAO Statistics Division has begun using a data quality dimensions very similar to that of Eurostat (2000). In addition to the core Eurostat data quality dimensions, a statistical metadata component was included. The statistical metadata component has been consolidated under the Agricultural Bulletin Board on Data Collection, Dissemination and Quality of Statistics project (ABCDQ) which focuses on national agricultural data that comes into the FAO Statistics Division. 2. Data flow and quality After reviewing the earlier work undertaken in FAO, a more comprehensive data quality evaluation and monitoring framework was developed. The approach is based on monitoring data quality at three points in the statistical process (q 1, q 2, and q 3), as well as the change in data quality between points q 1 and q 2 and between points q 2 and q 3 (see figure 1) ...|$|R

40|$|Background The aim of {{this study}} was to study {{ecological}} correlations between age-adjusted all-cause mortality rates in Australian <b>statistical</b> <b>divisions</b> and (1) the proportion of residents that self-identify as Indigenous, (2) remoteness, and (3) socio-economic deprivation. Methods All-cause mortality rates for 57 <b>statistical</b> <b>divisions</b> were calculated and directly standardized to the 1997 Australian population in 5 -year age groups using Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data. The proportion of residents who self-identified as Indigenous was obtained from the 1996 Census. Remoteness was measured using ARIA (Accessibility and Remoteness Index for Australia) values. Socioeconomic deprivation was measured using SEIFA (Socio-Economic index for Australia) values from the ABS. Results Age-standardized all-cause mortality varies twofold from 5. 7 to 11. 3 per 1000 across Australian <b>statistical</b> <b>divisions.</b> Strongest correlation was between Indigenous status and mortality (r = 0. 69, p < 0. 001). correlation between remoteness and mortality was modest (r = 0. 39, p = 0. 002) as was correlation between socio-economic deprivation and mortality (r = - 0. 42, p = 0. 001). Excluding the three divisions with the highest mortality, a multiple regression model using the logarithm of the adjusted mortality rate as the dependent variable showed that the partial correlation (and hence proportion of the variance explained) for Indigenous status was 0. 03 (9 per cent; p = 0. 03), for SEIFA score was - 0. 17 (3 per cent; p = 0. 22); and for remoteness was - 0. 22 (5 per cent; p = 0. 13). Collectively, the three variables studied explain 13 per cent of the variability in mortality. Conclusions Ecological correlation exists between all-cause mortality, Indigenous status, remoteness and disadvantage across Australia. The strongest correlation is with indigenous status, and correlation with all three characteristics is weak when the three <b>statistical</b> <b>divisions</b> with the highest mortality rates are excluded. intervention targeted at these three <b>statistical</b> <b>divisions</b> could reduce much of the variability in mortality in Australia...|$|R
