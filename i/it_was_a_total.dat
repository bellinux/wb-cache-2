The failure of Arab intelligence extended {{to the fact that they}} were totally unaware of how good Martel's forces were; Martel had trained them for a decade. And while he was well aware of the Caliphate's strengths and weaknesses, they knew almost nothing about the Franks. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>total</b> failure of the Muslim intelligence services.|$|E
25|$|The changes it {{had already}} {{undergone}} since the Indépendants of 1911 could leave people in no doubt as to its nature.

Its enemies could, eventually, have forgiven it if only it had passed away, like a fashion; but they became even more violent when they realised that it was destined to live a life that would be longer than that of those painters who had been the first to assume the responsibility for it.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the First World War, the British (as well as {{continental}} European) {{tradition was}} to bury officers {{who died on}} the battlefield in individual graves and common soldiers in mass graves. The Great War changed this sentiment, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>total</b> war, one in which nations engaged in the complete mobilization of all available resources, modes of production, and population in order to fight. Subsequently, as the war continued, there was a growing expectation among {{the people of the}} United Kingdom that foot soldiers as well as officers should not only be buried singly but commemorated. Many British families had already tried to visit the graves of loved ones, and could not locate them. Numerous letters appeared in newspapers decrying the problem, and Ware realized the British war effort was heading toward a public relations disaster. Ware, too, felt that the experience of war in the trenches was reducing socio-economic and class barriers. He firmly believed that British policy should be to treat all war dead alike, regardless of class or ability to pay. Wealthy families should not be able to repatriate their dead, inter remains privately in France, nor erect ornate memorials over their loved ones.|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "2112" [...] {{focuses on}} the {{struggle}} of an individual against the collectivist forces of a totalitarian state. This became the band's breakthrough release, but also brought unexpected criticism, {{mainly because of the}} credit of inspiration Peart gave to Ayn Rand in the liner notes. [...] "There was a remarkable backlash, especially from the English press, this being the late seventies, when collectivism was still in style, especially among journalists," [...] Peart said. [...] "They were calling us 'Junior fascists' and 'Hitler lovers.' <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>total</b> shock to me".|$|E

500|$|In early 1994, {{the film}} was in {{pre-production}} with Christopher [...] "Fangorn" [...] Baker as concept artist, and Sara Maitland assisting on the story, which gave it [...] "a feminist fairy-tale focus". Maitland said that Kubrick never referred to the film as A.I., but as Pinocchio. Chris Cunningham became the new visual effects supervisor. Some of his unproduced work for A.I. {{can be seen on}} the DVD, The Work of Director Chris Cunningham. Aside from considering computer animation, Kubrick also had Joseph Mazzello do a screen test for the lead role. Cunningham helped assemble a series of [...] "little robot-type humans" [...] for the David character. [...] "We tried to construct a little boy with a movable rubber face to see whether we could make it look appealing," [...] producer Jan Harlan reflected.

I never evaded the morning salute, which Paulina would slip when she could; nor was a certain little manner of still disdain a weapon known in my armoury of defence; whereas, Paulina always kept it clear, fine, and bright, and any rough German sally called forth at once its steelly glisten.|$|E

60|$|I am {{very glad}} of General F. J. Porter's victory. Still, if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>total</b> rout of the enemy, I am puzzled {{to know why}} the Richmond and Fredericksburg {{railroad}} was not seized again, as you say you have all the railroads but the Richmond and Fredericksburg. I am puzzled to see how, lacking that, you can have any, except the scrap from Richmond to West Point. The scrap of the Virginia Central from Richmond to Hanover Junction, without more, is simply nothing. That the whole of the enemy is concentrating on Richmond, I think cannot be certainly known to you or me. Saxton, at Harper's Ferry informs us that large forces, supposed to be Jackson's and Ewells, forced his advance from Charlestown today. General King telegraphs us from Fredericksburg that contrabands give certain information that 15,000 left Hanover Junction Monday morning to reinforce Jackson. I am painfully impressed with the importance of the struggle before you, and shall aid you all I can consistently with my view of due regard to all points.|$|E

Men came back from the country, and he went with Dunsford to have tea at an A. B. C. shop. The well-known uniform made him so miserable that he could not speak. The thought came to him that perhaps she had been transferred to another establishment of the firm for which she worked, and he might suddenly find himself face to face with her. The idea filled him with panic, so that he feared Dunsford would see that something was the matter with him: he could not think of anything to say; he pretended to listen to what Dunsford was talking about; the conversation maddened him; and it was all he could do to prevent himself from crying out to Dunsford for Heaven's sake to hold his tongue.|$|E
