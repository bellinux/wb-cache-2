40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} which patients are especially {{at risk for}} serious NSAID attributable <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>ulcers</b> and to compare the effectiveness of different preventive strategies in these patients. Methods: A case - control {{study was conducted in}} a large teaching hospital serving a population of 153. 000 in Enschede, the Netherlands. Participants were patients hospitalized with serious NSAID attributable ulcers between 1 November 2001 and 31 December 2003 and up to 4 controls per case, matched for age, sex and index date, retrieved from prescription registration databases of local community based pharmacies. Main outcome measures were Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios for serious NSAID attributable <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>ulcers</b> associated with selective COX- 2 inhibitors, concomitant use of proton-pump inhibitors, high dose histamine- 2 receptor antagonists or misoprostol. Results: During the observational period 104 incident cases and 284 matched controls were identified. Typical cases are elderly women with serious, especially cardiovascular, co-morbidity. Mortality due to serious NSAID ulcers is 14. 4 % within 3 months of the diagnosis. The use of proton-pump inhibitors was significantly higher in the controls than in the cases (27. 1 % and 13. 5 % respectively; P 0. 004). Use of selective cyclooxygenase- 2 inhibitors was comparable in both groups (cases 16. 4 % and controls 17. 6 %; P 0. 77).

40|$|Abstract. – OBJECTIVE: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) {{infection}} {{is the main}} cause of gastro-duodenal ulcer. The molecular mechanisms that underlying this progress are still not very clear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that function as negative regulator of nu-merous target genes at posttranscriptional lev-el. miRNAs plays important roles in the devel-opment of many infection related diseases. The roles of miRNAs in the development of H. pylori-infected <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>ulcer</b> haven’t been well studied yet. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The miRNA and mRNA profiles in normal gastroduodenal biopsy, H. pylori-infected gastroduodenal biop-sy and H. pylori-infected <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>ulcer</b> biopsy samples were compared and analyzed to identify potential related miRNAs and their target genes. The differential expression of the identified miRNAs and their target gene were validated in an independent set of H. pylori positive <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>ulcer</b> biopsy samples by immunohistochemistry staining and RT-PCR. Then microRNA mimics were transfected to gastric epithelial cells infected with H. pylori 26695 (cagA+). RT-PCR and Western blotting were performed to confirm the target gene of the identified microRNAs. RESULTS: The integrative analysis and im-munohistochemistry staining validation indicat-ed that miR- 155 and miR- 146 b, as well as their predicted target gene IL 6, are up-regulated in H. pylori positive <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>ulcer.</b> Further experiments in gastric epithelial cells revealed that H. pylori 26695 (cagA+) infection induces IL 6 overexpression. But the overexpression of IL 6 is weaken due to negative regulation by miR- 155 and miR- 146 b.

40|$|The {{paper is}} going to be {{presented}} at JSS 2003. Purpose: Gastrointestinal complications (GICs) such as <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>ulcer,</b> enterocolitis, and ischemic colitis after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are rare, but are associated with high mortality and morbidity. The present study was performed to detect risk factors and to investigate outcomes following GICs after CABG. Methods: Between January 1992 and December 2001, 17 of 549 patients (3. 1 %) developed GICs after CABG with cardiopulmonary bypass, presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding due to <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>ulcer,</b> enterocolitis, or ischemic colitis. We conducted a retrospective analysis of these patients. Results: All patients required emergent treatment for hemorrhage by means of blood transfu-sion and endoscopic ablation and/or clipping. The following possible predictors of GICs were identified by logistic multivariate analysis: age over 70, diabetes mellitus (particularly insulin-dependent diabetes), history of cerebrovascular disease or history of renal failure and postop-erative low output syndrome (LOS). Conclusion: Our results suggested that GICs after CABG with cardiopulmonary bypass are rare but can be lethal. Early diagnosis and prompt intervention can be difficult but are poten-tially life saving for patients in whom GICs develop.

40|$|Aim: To {{test whether}} {{treatment}} with celecoxib reduces {{the incidence of}} <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>ulcers</b> compared to diclofenac in Asian patients with osteoarthritis (OA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with minimal significant risk factors. Methods: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of OA or RA of at least 3 months were randomized to 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with celecoxib 100 mg twice daily (n = 440) or diclofenac 50 mg twice daily (n = 440). The primary outcome was the gastric and/or duodenal ulcer rate at endpoint as determined by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy performed during the screening week, and at endpoint. Results: There {{was no significant difference}} in the overall incidence of <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>ulcers</b> at 12 -week endpoint for celecoxib compared to diclofenac (2. 8 % vs. 5. 1 %; Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel [CMH] χ 2 P = 0. 083). However, there was a significantly lower incidence of gastric ulcers on celecoxib versus diclofenac (0. 5 % vs. 3. 6 %; CMH χ 2 P = 0. 002). Approximately 59 % of patients in both treatment groups had no visible gastric lesions at endpoint; and a similar proportion were found to have one or more erosions on celecoxib (n = 85; 21. 4 %) and diclofenac (N = 91; 23. 3 %). A survival analysis of time to ulcer was significant for gastric ulcers (log-rank P = 0. 004), but not for duodenal <b>ulcers,</b> or for <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>ulcers</b> combined.

40|$|Introduction: To meet key {{millennium}} development goals, {{the rural}} population {{needs to be}} reached for health assessment and service delivery. <b>Gastroduodenal</b> <b>ulcer</b> disease is a common ailment affecting the health of people in Uganda. A cross-sectional study was conducted at Bwera Hospital in Kasese district of western Uganda, to establish the prevalence and predisposing factors of Helicobacter pylori among <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>ulcer</b> disease patients. Methods: A sample of 174 patients with symptoms of <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>ulcer</b> disease was purposively obtained. Using two laboratory test methods, the prevalence of H. pylori among these patients was determined. A structured questionnaire was administered to participants to establish their demographic background and selected aspects of their lifestyle. Finally, the results obtained by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunochromatographic rapid test (IRT) were compared. Results: We established the prevalence of H. pylori as 29. 9 % (52 / 174) by ELISA and 37. 4 % (65 / 174) by IRT. Cigarette smoking, poor sanitation, and lack of formal education were the significant predisposing factors with p-values < 0. 05. The two tests gave identical results in 87. 9 % of the patients. Discussion: The prevalence of H. pylori by IRT and ELISA test methods was similar {{to what has been}} reported elsewhere in developed countries; but was lower than previously reported in developing countries including Uganda. The previous studies in Uganda were carried out in the urban population and on young children; and some used antibody-detection methods only, therefore leading to different prevalence as a result of difference in study population and methods...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{analyze the}} {{different}} effects of clinical application of laparoscopic repair and conventional open repair of perforated <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>ulcer.</b> Methods: A total of 98 patients with <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>ulcer</b> perforation {{were included in}} the study, hospital stay interval was from September 2012 to November 2014, and according to different surgeries they received, patients were divided into laparoscopic group and open surgery group (n= 49). Peripheral blood and urine 1 h after operation were obtained from two groups to detect the differences in levels of pain-related indexes, intestinal wall damage-related indexes, Th 1 and Th 2 type factors and neurotransmitter type indexes. Results: Serum SP, NPY, PGE 2 and HA values of laparoscopic group 1 h after operation were lower than those of open surgery group; urine LMR and IFABP of laparoscopic group 1 h after operation were lower than those of open surgery group, and serum ET, PG, D-lactate, DAO and sICAM- 1 values were lower than those of open surgery group; serum IFN-γ, TNF-毩, IL- 2, IL- 4, IL- 6 and IL- 10 values of laparoscopic group 1 h after operation were lower than those of open surgery group; serum 5 -HTP, 5 -HIAA, NE and DA values of laparoscopic group 1 h after operation were lower than those of open surgery group, and Ach level was higher than that open surgery group. Conclusion: On the premise of protecting gastrointestinal function, laparoscopic repair of perforated <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>ulcer</b> can reduce surgical inflammatory stress trauma in patients, and has positive clinical significance...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{combination}} of modern antisecretory drugs and eradication of Helicobacter pylori {{has changed the}} treatment options for peptic ulcer patients in favour of conservative therapy. Surgical approach {{which is used to}} be main treatment option has become now exceptional for uncomplicated <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>ulcers.</b> However, it includes fixing the problem leaving the origin of the problem. We presented a peptic ulcer patient with recurrent attacks of ulcer perforation and discussed the surgical approach to these complicated cases...|$|R
40|$|Common {{causes of}} chronic upper {{gastrointestinal}} bleeding include oesophageal varices, <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>ulcers</b> and malignancy, and patients mostly present with iron deficiency type anaemia. We present {{the case of}} a 60 -year-old lady who presented with iron deficiency anaemia and on investigation was found to have a large duodenal polyp requiring surgical excision. On histological examination, the polyp was revealed to be a lipoma. We review the recent literature and formulate a management plan for this rare entity...|$|R

There-fore, it is clinically important to prevent gastroduodenal mucosal injury in patients talking LDA. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are considered to be the preferred agents for prophylaxis of LDA-related gastroduodenal antagonist (H 2 RA), has also been reported to suppress the development of LDA-related <b>gastroduodenal</b> <b>ulcers</b> [6]. One prospective, randomized, comparative study [7] examined the effects of H 2 RAs vs. PPIs on the primary prevention of LDA-related gastric mucosal injury and showed that 15 mg/day of lansoprazole is more effective in preventing LDA-related gastric mucosal injury than 40 mg/day of famotidine. However, in that study, the duration of treatment was only seven days. Another pro-spective, randomized, comparative study [8] examined the effects of H 2 RAs vs. PPIs on the secondary preven-tion of LDA-related dyspeptic or bleeding gastroduode- * Correspondence...|$|R
