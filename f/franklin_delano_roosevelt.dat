5|$|In 1954, Tammany Hall boss Carmine DeSapio led {{the effort}} to defeat Eleanor's son, <b>Franklin</b> <b>Delano</b> <b>Roosevelt,</b> Jr., in the {{election}} for New York Attorney General. Eleanor grew increasingly disgusted with DeSapio's political conduct {{through the rest of}} the 1950s. Eventually, she would join with her old friends Herbert Lehman and Thomas Finletter to form the New York Committee for Democratic Voters, a group dedicated to opposing DeSapio's reincarnated Tammany Hall. Their efforts were eventually successful, and DeSapio was forced to relinquish power in 1961.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, President <b>Franklin</b> <b>Delano</b> <b>Roosevelt</b> had {{the tree}} {{moved from the}} Ellipse to the White House grounds, where it {{remained}} until 1954 when it was returned to the Ellipse. In 1946, the lighting ceremony became a televised event, though not with widespread telecast. From 1948 to 1951, President Harry S. Truman signalled the lighting of the tree by remote control from his Independence, Missouri home, but in 1952, he stayed at the White House for the lighting ceremony. In 1953, the ceremony was widely telecast and President Dwight David Eisenhower's address was radio broadcast through the Voice of America in thirty-four languages.|$|E

5|$|Pennsylvania {{was laid}} down on 27 October 1913, with goals of {{fourteen}} months until launch, and thirty-two until completion. The as-yet unnamed Arizona was laid {{down on the}} morning of 16 March 1914 with Assistant Secretary of the Navy <b>Franklin</b> <b>Delano</b> <b>Roosevelt</b> in attendance, and the builders intended to set a world-record ten months between keel-laying and launch, These ambitious goals—Pennsylvanias anticipated completion date was a full two months earlier than the American record—were set by Navy Secretary Josephus Daniels, who wanted the United States to compete with British and German building achievements.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt {{received}} {{the first annual}} <b>Franklin</b> <b>Delano</b> <b>Roosevelt</b> Brotherhood Award in 1946.

She was the most admired living woman, according to Gallup's most admired man and woman poll of Americans, in 1948, 1949, 1950, 1952, 1953, 1954, 1955, 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, and 1961.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{constructing}} a road up Whiteface Mountain was first conceived {{in the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries by Marcellus Leonard, an entrepreneur from Saranac Lake. The plans for the highway {{began to take shape}} in the 1920s when the land for the road was given by its owner to the state of New York on the condition that it would be named after America's Great War veterans. The road was later renamed to honor veterans from all wars. Governor <b>Franklin</b> <b>Delano</b> <b>Roosevelt</b> signed the dedication for the highway in 1929.|$|E

5|$|When {{it came to}} {{personal}} politics, Crawford aligned herself as a Democrat who greatly supported, and admired, the administrations of John F.

I have struggled greatly in life from the day I was born and I am honored {{to be a part}} of something that focuses on working class citizens and molds them into a proud specimen. Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Kennedy have done so much in that regard for the two generations they've won over during their career course.|$|E
5|$|Operation Tonga {{originated}} in the planning of Operation Overlord, the Allied plan for the eventual invasion and liberation of German-occupied France. Invasion planning begun in May 1943, when President of the United States <b>Franklin</b> <b>Delano</b> <b>Roosevelt</b> and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill met during the Washington Conference. The two Allied leaders decided that all available Allied forces should be concentrated in the United Kingdom, and that planning for the invasion of North-Western Europe should begin. A provisional target date of May 1944 was set with the code-name 'Overlord' decided upon. A joint Anglo-American planning staff was created under Lieutenant-General Frederick E. Morgan, who was given the title of Chief of Staff to the Supreme Allied Commander (COSSAC).|$|E
5|$|The Eleanor Roosevelt Monument in New York's Riverside Park was {{dedicated}} in 1996, with First Lady Hillary Clinton {{serving as the}} keynote speaker. It {{is said to be}} the first monument to an American president's wife. The centerpiece is a statue of Eleanor sculpted by Penelope Jencks, and the surrounding granite pavement contains inscriptions designed by the architect Michael Middleton Dwyer, including summaries of her achievements, and a quote from her 1958 speech at the United Nations advocating universal human rights. The following year, the <b>Franklin</b> <b>Delano</b> <b>Roosevelt</b> Memorial {{was dedicated}}; it has a bronze statue of Eleanor Roosevelt standing before the United Nations emblem, which honors her dedication to the United Nations.

5|$|The {{reservoir}} {{is called}} <b>Franklin</b> <b>Delano</b> <b>Roosevelt</b> Lake, {{named after the}} United States President {{who presided over the}} authorization and completion of the dam. Creation of the reservoir forced the relocation of over 3,000 people, including Native Americans whose ancestral lands were partially flooded. While the dam does not contain fish-ladders, neither does the next down-stream dam, Chief Joseph Dam. This means that no salmon ever reach the Grand Coulee Dam, rendering the possibility of added fish-ladders superfluous. Despite this, the second large dam down-stream, Rocky Reach Dam, does contains an intricate system of fish ladders to accommodate yearly salmon spawning. Being itself 473 miles upstream of the mouth of the Columbia River, there is currently no issue with salmon spawning that Grand Coulee or Chief Joseph dams are at fault for.|$|E
5|$|Former U.S. Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and <b>Franklin</b> <b>Delano</b> <b>Roosevelt</b> {{attended}} the law school.

Eisenhower served as the thirteenth president of Columbia University from 1948 to 1953. The university has also educated 26 foreign heads of state, including President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili, President of East Timor Jose Ramos Horta, President of Estonia Toomas Hendrik Ilves and other historical figures such as Wellington Koo, Radovan Karadžić, Gaston Eyskens, and T. V. Soong. The author of India's constitution and Dalit leader Dr. B. R. Ambedkar was also an alumnus of Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Greatly {{concerned}} about the growing partisanship within {{the government and the}} detrimental impact political parties could have on the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington struggled throughout his eight-year presidency to hold rival factions together. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never to be affiliated with a political party. In spite of his efforts, debates over Hamilton's economic policy, the French Revolution, and the Jay Treaty deepened ideological divisions. Those that supported Hamilton formed the Federalist Party, while his opponents coalesced around Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and formed the Democratic-Republican Party. While criticized for furthering the partisanship he sought to avoid by identifying himself with Hamilton, Washington is nonetheless considered by scholars and political historians {{as one of the greatest}} presidents in American history, usually ranking in the top three with Abraham Lincoln and <b>Franklin</b> <b>Delano</b> <b>Roosevelt.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1940, when Germany {{attacked}} Great Britain, the United States {{feared that}} if Germany controlled Great Britain, Mexico and the U.S. would be next. In the same year, President <b>Franklin</b> <b>Delano</b> <b>Roosevelt</b> ordered {{the construction of}} a naval base in the Atlantic similar to Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. The site was meant to provide anchorage, docking, repair facilities, fuel, and supplies for 60% of the Atlantic Fleet. The naval base, which was named U.S. Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, became the largest naval installation in the world in landmass and was meant to be the Pearl Harbor of the Atlantic. However, with the defeat of Germany in 1945, the United States concentrated all of their efforts to the war in the Pacific. In May 2003, after six decades of existence, the base was officially shut down by the U.S. Navy.|$|E
5|$|The annual Thanksgiving holiday is {{a fairly}} recent creation. Throughout the early 19th century, the U.S. {{government}} had declared a particular day as a national day of Thanksgiving, but these were one-time declarations meant to celebrate a significant event, such as victory in a battle. The northeastern states began adopting an annual day of Thanksgiving in November shortly {{after the end of}} the War of 1812. Sarah Josepha Hale, editor of Boston's Ladies' Magazine, wrote editorials beginning in 1827 which called for the nationwide expansion of this annual day of thanksgiving to commemorate the Pilgrim's first harvest feast. After nearly 40 years, Abraham Lincoln declared the first modern Thanksgiving to fall on the last Thursday in November in 1863. <b>Franklin</b> <b>Delano</b> <b>Roosevelt</b> and Congress ultimately moved it to the fourth Thursday in November. After some sparring as to the date, the holiday was recognized by Congress as an official federal holiday in 1941.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{returned}} to politics after the 1929 {{stock market crash}} {{and the beginning of}} the Great Depression. He decided to run for the presidency. He formed the Liberty Party and held their national convention at Monte Ne. It was the only presidential convention ever held in Arkansas. Harvey prepared with railroad excursion rates, media facilities, upgraded roads, and food concessions, anticipating 10,000 delegates. He tented the amphitheater, set up seating, and installed an amplifier system to reach the thousands to be seated outside. Delegates were only eligible to attend if they certified they had read and agreed with the principles of Harvey's newest book The Book, which dealt with the harmful effects of usury by the government. In the end only 786 delegates attended, and Harvey was the only candidate the delegates could agree on. They nominated Andrae Nordskog of Los Angeles for vice president. The Liberty Party ended up merging with the Jobless Party, and Harvey ran for president as an independent; however, he is usually incorrectly credited as being their candidate in that election. Regardless, <b>Franklin</b> <b>Delano</b> <b>Roosevelt</b> won the 1932 presidential election, and Harvey only drew 800 votes.|$|E

5|$|Roosevelt was {{a member}} of the {{prominent}} American Roosevelt and Livingston families and a niece of President Theodore Roosevelt. She had an unhappy childhood, having suffered the deaths of both parents and one of her brothers at a young age. At 15, she attended Allenwood Academy in London and was deeply influenced by its feminist headmistress Marie Souvestre. Returning to the U.S., she married her fifth cousin once removed, <b>Franklin</b> <b>Delano</b> <b>Roosevelt,</b> in 1905. The Roosevelts' marriage was complicated from the beginning by Franklin's controlling mother, Sara, and after Eleanor discovered her husband's affair with Lucy Mercer in 1918, she resolved to seek fulfillment in a public life of her own. She persuaded Franklin to stay in politics after he was stricken with debilitating polio in 1921, which cost him the normal use of his legs, and Roosevelt began giving speeches and appearing at campaign events in his place. Following Franklin's election as Governor of New York in 1928, and throughout the remainder of Franklin's public career in government, Roosevelt regularly made public appearances on his behalf, and as First Lady while her husband served as President, she significantly reshaped and redefined the role of that office during her own tenure and beyond, for future First Ladies.|$|E
5|$|By December 1942, with Allied forces {{advancing}} through Tunisia, the North African {{campaign was}} coming to a close; victory in North Africa being imminent, discussions began between the Allies over what their next objective should be. Many Americans argued for an immediate invasion of France, while the British believed {{that it should be}} the island of Sardinia, as did General Dwight D. Eisenhower. In January 1943 the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and the President of the United States, <b>Franklin</b> <b>Delano</b> <b>Roosevelt,</b> met at the Casablanca conference and settled the debate: the island of Sicily would be the Allies' next objective. The invasion and occupation of Sicily would benefit the Allies by opening Mediterranean sea routes for Allied shipping and allowing Allied bombers to operate from airfields that were much closer to mainland Italy and Germany. The codename Operation Husky was eventually decided on for the invasion, and planning began in February. The British Eighth Army, under the command of General Bernard Montgomery, would land on the south-eastern corner of the island and advance north to the port of Syracuse, while the US Seventh Army, commanded by General George Patton, would land on the south coast and move towards the port of Palermo on the western corner of the island. The landings would be made simultaneously along a 100-mile (160-km) stretch of the island's south-eastern coastline.|$|E
5|$|Eleanor's son Elliott {{authored}} numerous books, {{including a}} mystery series in which Eleanor was the detective. However, these murder mysteries were researched and written by William Harrington. They continued until Harrington's death in 2000, {{ten years after}} Elliott's death. With James Brough, Elliot also wrote a highly personal book about his parents called The Roosevelts of Hyde Park: An Untold Story, in which he revealed details about the sexual lives of his parents, including his father's relationships with mistress Lucy Mercer and secretary Marguerite ("Missy") LeHand, as well as graphic details surrounding the illness that crippled his father. Published in 1973, the biography also contains valuable insights into FDR's run for vice-president, his rise to the governorship of New York, and his capture of the presidency in 1932, particularly {{with the help of}} Louis Howe. When Elliott published this book in 1973, <b>Franklin</b> <b>Delano</b> <b>Roosevelt</b> Jr. led the family's denunciation of him; the book was fiercely repudiated by all Elliot's siblings. Another of the siblings, James, published My Parents, a Differing View (with Bill Libby, 1976), which was written in part as a response to Elliot's book. A sequel to An Untold Story with James Brough, published in 1975 and titled A Rendezvous With Destiny, carried the Roosevelt saga to the end of World War II. Mother R.: Eleanor Roosevelt's Untold Story, also with Brough, was published in 1977. Eleanor Roosevelt, with Love: A Centenary Remembrance, came out in 1984.|$|E
