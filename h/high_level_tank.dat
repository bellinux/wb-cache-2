40|$|General project objectives. This project seeks a {{fundamental}} understanding and major improvement in cesium separation from high-level waste by cesium-selective calixcrown extractants. Systems {{of particular interest}} involve novel solvent-extraction systems containing specific members of the calix[4]arene-crown- 6 family, alcohol solvating agents, and alkylamines. Questions being addressed pertain to cesium binding strength, extraction selectivity, cesium stripping, and extractant solubility. Enhanced properties in this regard will specifically benefit cleanup projects funded by the USDOE Office of Environmental Management to treat and dispose of high-level radioactive wastes currently stored in underground tanks at the Savannah River Site (SRS), the Hanford site, and the Idaho National Environmental and Engineering Laboratory. 1 The most direct beneficiary will be the SRS Salt Processing Project, which has recently identified the Caustic-Side Solvent Extraction (CSSX) process employing a calixcrown as its preferred technology for cesium removal from SRS <b>high</b> <b>level</b> <b>tank</b> waste. 2 This technology owes its development in part to fundamental results obtained in this program...|$|E

Calix[4]bis-crown- 6 -ethers in the 1, 3 -alternate conformation have been shown to possess a high degree of selectivity for cesium over sodium (Cs/Na selectivity > 104 in selected diluents), and moderate selectivity over potassium (Cs/K selectivity of about 102 in selected diluents). The work has involved the preparation of a new class of calixarene-based ionophores. Of particular interest within this class of compounds are various derivatives of calix[4]arene-crown- 4, -crown- 5, and -crown- 6 ionophores, possessing high selectivities for sodium, potassium, and cesium, respectively. The goal is to synthetically modify the ionophore by attaching a fluorescent probe molecule to the crown ring in such a manner that fluorescence is normally quenched by photoinduced electron transfer but becomes activated upon complexation of the metal ion. The concept has been evaluated by observing the fluorescence quenching (of the naphthylene group) following Cs{sup +} complexation of the ligand calix[4]-bis-(2, 3 -naphtho-crown- 6). The authors are investigating potential fluorescence turn-on groups in simple crown ethers as a model for the behavior to be expected in calix crowns. They have investigated the fluorescence enhancement following metal ion complexation for the 9 -methylanthracene derivative of dibenzo- 21 -crown- 7. The degree of enhancement was disappointing, and they are preparing the 9 -methyl- 10 -cyanoanthracene derivative, which is expected to show a greater signal enhancement. Other attractive fluorescence turn-on groups are under investigation. N- 1 -pyrenylmethyl-monoaza- 18 -crown- 6 and N-(1 -pyrenyl- 4 -butyl) monoaza- 18 -crown- 6 were synthesized by the reaction of the appropriate bromo-pyrene derivatives with aza- 18 - crown- 6. The compound with one carbon atom separating the aza nitrogen and the pyrene shows relatively weak fluorescence in the absence of metal ion complexation. In the presence of K{sup +} the fluorescence is enhanced by a factor of 4. The derivative with four carbon atoms shows little quenching or metal ion enhancement. The rate of photoincuced electron transfer quenching is apparently very sensitive to the number of carbon atoms separating the fluorophore and the quencher. ...|$|E
