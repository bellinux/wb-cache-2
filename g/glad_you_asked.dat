2500|$|Hansen {{later said}} {{this was the moment}} where he [...] "had" [...] him. Since all Hansen had to go on was the word of David Stanley and his mother, he could not have known for sure if there really had been money in the envelope. In fact, Hansen never {{actually}} mentioned money when he produced the envelopes, only asking {{whether or not there was}} any correspondence between the AD's office and the Stanley family. By refusing to acknowledge that he had, in fact, sent something to Stanley's family and then backtracking when confronted with evidence that contradicted his statement, Hansen knew Parker was hiding something. Hansen also admitted that Parker could've just lied about the contents of the envelopes and his investigation would've been stopped cold. As Hansen said years after the incident, [...] "That was the defining moment. All (Parker) had to say was, 'I'm <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked,</b> I sent him an insurance form,' and we would've had to start all over, because every dot that we connected started from the premise that we know he sent something." ...|$|E

6000|$|Herminia's throat flushed a rosy red, and an unwonted {{sense of}} {{pleasure}} stole over that hard-worked frame {{as she listened}} to his words; for indeed she was fond of him. But she answered him at once without a moment's hesitation. [...] "Harvey, I'm <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me, for I like and admire you. But I feel sure beforehand my answer must be NO. For I think what you mean is to ask, will I marry you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> the question, Simek," [...] he replied, [...] "because {{it gives}} me the {{opportunity}} of telling you that I have asked God, {{in the name of}} Jesus, to bring us out of our present trouble, and also of explaining that I never pray without adding the words `if it be Thy will'--for God does not always answer prayer exactly in accordance with our request, but according to His own wisdom; so that, if He were hereafter to say, `Now, is not that better than you asked?' we would be obliged to reply, `Yes, Lord, it is better.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I might, mightn't I? I {{can hardly}} believe it's true. I've dreamt it so often. It rather tickles me that I should have been so jolly <b>glad</b> that <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> me to take you out to dinner. Whom {{are you going to}} marry?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Was this Mrs. Hignett the Mrs. Hignett, {{the world-famous}} writer on Theosophy, {{the author of}} [...] "The Spreading Light," [...] "What of the Morrow," [...] {{and all the rest}} of that {{well-known}} series? I'm <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> me. Yes, she was. She had come over to America on a lecturing tour.|$|E
6000|$|But Bagwax {{had made}} up his mind, and nothing would shake him. 'If they'll let me go out all the same, to set matters right, of course I'd take the job. I should think it a duty, and would bear the delay as well as I could. If Jemima thought it right I'm sure she wouldn't complain. But since I saw that letter on that stamp my {{conscience}} has told me that I must reveal it all. It might be me as was in prison, and Jemima who was told that I had a wife in Australia. Since I've looked at it in that light I've been more determined than ever to go to Sir John Joram's chambers on Monday. Good-night, Mr. Curlydown. I am very <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> {{me down to the}} cottage to-day; more glad than anything.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{she told}} him, [...] "I'm <b>glad</b> that <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> {{me to come}} with you. I think I was one of your first friends and I'm pleased that you should wish to spend part of your last day in my company." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I am <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> have <b>asked</b> the Cochrane {{girls to}} stay with you, Violet,” she said. “I think you need {{stirring}} up, and though {{there is not a}} great deal in Lily Cochrane or her sister, nobody could accuse them of undue quietness. They are coming?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{certainly}} did," [...] he said. [...] "I am <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> did not <b>ask</b> me to {{hire you}} the boys. The system under which he obtained them is an iniquity." ...|$|R

40|$|Q {{methodology}} {{is a mixed}} blessing. No {{doubt about}} it. Any method which has such an openly qualiquantological heritage (see Stenner and Stainton Rogers (2004) for a fuller explanation of this disgraceful neologism) risks being singled out and victimized. This is, after all, a method which {{has its roots in}} the psychological laboratories of Charles Spearman and Cyril Burt – laboratories which throughout the 1920 s and 1930 s were responsible for the invention and refinement of the psychometric techniques that still characterize the discipline today (often to the detriment of qualitative techniques). Yet, if that were not shameful enough, here it is rearing its frankly ugly head (nearly a century later) in the pages of a handbook of qualitative research methods. You see? We warned you. So how did it end up here? That is a good question and we are <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked...</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Isn't it nice? Aren't <b>you</b> <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> came?" [...] <b>asked</b> Sophie, as she led {{her friends}} into the parlor, {{which she had}} {{redeemed}} from its primness by putting bright chintz curtains to the windows, hemlock boughs over the old portraits, a china bowl of flowers on the table, and a splendid fire on the wide hearth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said slowly; [...] "I {{think she}} is too good even for you, and you have done all that any one could have {{expected}} of you, without keeping up the farce any longer. I am <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> did not <b>ask</b> if I believed you--because I could scarcely have forgiven you that question. Do you think I don't know--both of you--better?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The Second Lady: [...] "I am so <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> {{happened}} to <b>ask</b> me. It has all been so dreadfully sudden, and I am quite bewildered. Let me {{think if there}} is anything more!" [...] As she stands with her finger to her lip, the first lady makes a movement as if about to speak, but does not say anything. [...] "No, there is nothing more, I believe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Edmund, smiling, [...] "to {{give you}} a proof of my sincerity, I think you had better perhaps go rather later in the day. My uncle very {{unnecessarily}} hurried himself, thinking that he was keeping me waiting to help him down stairs, and I thought he seemed rather tired; but he will be very <b>glad</b> to see <b>you</b> in the afternoon. Indeed, he would be very <b>glad</b> now, only <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> me as a question of prudence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't like Lopez, you know," [...] Mr. Wharton said to John Fletcher afterwards. [...] "How {{would it}} be {{possible}} that I should like such a man? But there can be no good got by complaints. It is not what your mother suffers, or what even I may suffer,--or worse again, what Arthur may suffer, that makes the sadness of all this. What will be her life? That is the question. And it is too near me, too important to me, for the endurance either of scorn or pity. I was <b>glad</b> that <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> your mother to be silent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am heartily <b>glad.</b> That <b>you</b> would <b>ask</b> her I {{knew from}} what you told me; and {{although}} I knew nothing of her thoughts in the matter, I felt sure that she would hardly say no. Netta, darling, I am glad. Long ago I thought and hoped that this would come about. It {{seemed to me that}} it would be such a happy thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{it was her}} brother's ready {{acquiescence}} which troubled Mary chiefly. He wrote {{as though}} there were {{no doubt about the}} matter. [...] "Of course there is a deal of shooting to be done," [...] he said, [...] "and I consider myself bound to look after it. There ought not to be less than four guns,--particularly if Warburton is to be one of them. I like Warburton very much, and I think he shoots badly to ingratiate himself with the governor. I wonder whether the governor would get leave for Gerald for a week. He has been sticking to his work like a brick. If not, would he mind my bringing someone? <b>You</b> <b>ask</b> the governor and let me know. I'll be there on the 20th. I wonder whether they'll let me hear what goes on among them about politics. I'm sure there {{is not one of them}} hates Sir Timothy worse than I do. Lady Mab is a brick, and I'm <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> have <b>asked</b> her. I don't think she'll come, as she likes shutting herself up at Grex. Miss Boncassen is another brick. And if you can manage about Gerald I will say that you are a third." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ill at ease,--yes. At {{any rate}} let none others be sent out." [...] Then he remembered a kindly purpose {{which he had}} formed early in the day, and fell back upon that. [...] "I should, however, be <b>glad</b> if <b>you</b> would <b>ask</b> Lady Rosina De Courcy to remain here." [...] The Duchess stared at him, really {{thinking}} now that something was amiss with him. [...] "The whole thing is a failure and I will have no more of it. It is degrading me." [...] Then without allowing her a moment in which to answer him, he marched {{back to his own}} room.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Maud Barrington softly. [...] "Now, at least, I {{can tell}} <b>you</b> I am <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> went away--but if <b>you</b> had <b>asked</b> me I {{would have gone}} with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm so <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> {{could let}} me!" [...] he said, [...] "and I want to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> now when I may come again. But {{if you need}} me, you'll----" ...|$|R
6000|$|The girl nodded shortly. [...] "It's not my business," [...] she said. [...] "I am <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> came. I {{wanted to}} <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> something. Who {{is this man}} Rowan who killed my uncle?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Bill," [...] Mr. Porson said gravely. [...] "It {{would not}} do at all, and I am <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> came to <b>ask</b> me. If I thought it certain that the jury would find a verdict of guilty, and that Ned, {{innocent}} as I believe him of the crime, would be hung, I should say that your plan might be worth thinking of; for in that case Ned might possibly be got away till we his friends here could get {{at the bottom of}} the matter. Still it would be an acknowledgment for the time of his guilt, and I am sure that Ned himself would not run away without standing his trial even if the doors of his cell were opened. I shall see him tomorrow morning, and will tell him of your scheme on his behalf. I am sure he will be grateful, but I am pretty certain that he will not avail himself of it. If you will come down tomorrow evening I will let you know exactly what he says." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> feel penitent, at any rate. I expect Miss Flossie Lane has <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> {{what you}} think of her friend, Miss Orford, and told you that she was engaged to Lord Fanleighton." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The liner will {{be clear}} of the land by now," [...] she said. [...] "I suppose <b>you</b> are <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> did not go with Jefferson? You never {{told me that he}} had <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> to!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{if it was}} so, Raoul, he {{will not}} swell the queen's army to any {{dangerous}} extent. I am <b>glad</b> that <b>you</b> didn't <b>ask</b> him any questions; for if he declared himself a Huguenot--and to do them justice, the Huguenots will never deny their faith--I suppose {{it would have been}} our duty to have fallen upon them and slaughtered them; and though I am willing enough to draw, when numbers are nearly equal and it is a fair fight, I will take no part in the slaughter of men when we are twenty to one against them. Three or four men, more or less, at Nerac will make no difference. The Queen of Navarre has but some fifty men in all and, whenever the orders come to seize her and her son, it may be done easily enough, whether she has fifty or a hundred with her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>glad</b> <b>you</b> are so prompt," [...] said she. [...] "Promptness {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} things in life. Now I am very, very busy these days, as you know, so we will begin school at once. Before either of <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> any questions, I am going to ask some myself. Peter, what do you look like? Where do you live? What do you eat? I want to find out just how much you really know about yourself." ...|$|R
