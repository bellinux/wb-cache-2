5000|$|... #Subtitle level 3: Equity {{will not}} {{complete}} an <b>imperfect</b> <b>gift</b> ...|$|E
50|$|Note the {{exception}} in Strong v Bird (1874) LR 18 Eq 315. If the donor appoints the intended donee as executor of his/her will, and the donor subsequently dies, equity will perfect the <b>imperfect</b> <b>gift.</b>|$|E
5000|$|If a donor {{has made}} an <b>imperfect</b> <b>gift,</b> i.e. lacking the formalities {{required}} at common law, equity will not assist the intended donee. This maxim is a subset of equity will not assist a volunteer [...]|$|E
50|$|The Court of Appeal in Chancery {{held that}} there was no trust, because the fatherâ€™s {{intention}} was an outright transfer. They refused to perfect an <b>imperfect</b> <b>gift</b> through a successful declaration of trust. Lord Cranworth LC gave the judgment of the court.|$|E
50|$|When a donor {{makes an}} <b>imperfect</b> <b>gift</b> during his lifetime, and the donee is {{subsequently}} appointed as the donor's executor or becomes the donor's administrator on intestacy, the gift is perfected because the donee obtains legal {{title to the}} donor's property, including {{the subject matter of}} the intended gift, in the donee's capacity as executor or administrator.|$|E
50|$|The poem is a {{dramatic}} monologue in blank verse {{from the point of}} view of Tithonus. Unlike the original myth, it is Tithonus who asks for immortality, and it is Aurora, not Zeus, who grants this <b>imperfect</b> <b>gift.</b> As narrator, Tithonus laments his unnatural longevity, which separates him from the mortal world as well as from the immortal but beautiful Aurora.|$|E
50|$|The Court of Appeal {{held the}} {{mistress}} occupied the house under a bare licence, and had received an <b>imperfect</b> <b>gift</b> of the house. No trust could be inferred, but the encouragement {{to improve the}} house in the belief it was hers created a proprietary estoppel. A mere licence can be defeated by a sale of the house, so the husband would have to execute a conveyance, Dillwyn v Llewelyn (1862) 4 De GF&J 517, Inwards v Baker 1965 2 QB 29, and Crabb v Arun DC 1976 Ch 179 applied.|$|E
5000|$|In case 1 above, {{the donor}} {{must have done}} {{everything}} necessary to be done which is within his own power {{to do in order}} to transfer the gifted asset to the donee. If the donor has not done so, the gift is incomplete since the donee has no equity to perfect an <b>imperfect</b> <b>gift,</b> for which there is a long line of authority. [...] Moreover, the court will not give a benevolent construction so as to treat ineffective words of outright gift as taking effect as if the donor had declared himself a trustee for the donee, see Milroy v Lord (1862) 4 De G F & J 264.|$|E
5000|$|The Privy Council {{advised that}} the {{fairness}} required by equity meant {{the fact that}} the trust property was vested in one trustee (Mr Pagarani himself) {{at the time of the}} gift was sufficient to make the conveyance to the trust valid. Lord Browne-Wilkinson said the most important question was this: on the basis that Mr Pagarani intended to make an immediate absolute gift [...] "to the Foundation", but had not vested the gifted property in all the trustees of the Foundation, are the trusts of the Foundation trust deed enforceable against the deposits and the shares, or was it (as the judge at first instance and the Court of Appeal had held) a case where there has been an <b>imperfect</b> <b>gift</b> which cannot be enforced against Mr Pagarani's estate whatever his intentions might have been? ...|$|E
