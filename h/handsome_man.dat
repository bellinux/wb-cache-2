5|$|According to Vid Gaković, who was {{a member}} of National Unity in 1914, Stojanović was an ambitious and talented young man. He was {{determined}} that his voice would be heard and he liked being the centre of attention. He was severe to younger members of the association, whom he sometimes sharply criticised. Nevertheless, younger students liked being around him. Gaković described him as a tall and <b>handsome</b> <b>man</b> who greatly cared about his appearance; he wore a bow tie and a broad-brimmed hat.|$|E
5|$|Atangana {{travelled}} {{frequently in}} the French colonial period. He {{made a point of}} attending his subjects' weddings and funerals, for example. He had more opportunities to visit Europe, including the Paris Colonial Exposition in 1931 and the French Colonial Conference in 1935. In 1938, his wife died. Atangana was a <b>handsome</b> <b>man</b> by Ewondo standards: strong, well groomed, with a reputation as a good fighter, dancer, and husband. He remarried on 6 January 1940 to Julienne or Yuliana Ngonoa, a young Beti woman of the Mvog Manga sublineage from the village Nkolafamba. She bore him two children: Marie-Thérèse and René Grégoire. Atangana seems to have adhered to Catholic strictures against polygamy, despite the fact that other Beti chiefs at the time had several hundred wives.|$|E
5|$|Other scriptures {{describe}} other {{visits by}} Shiva to Deodar Forest in his Bhikshatana form. The Vamana Purana mentions Shiva entering the Deodar Forest twice as a beggar. Maddened {{by the death}} of his first wife Sati but chased by the love-god Kamadeva, Shiva escapes to the Deodar Forest and lives as a mendicant. The sages' wives who come to grant him food become sexually excited at the mere sight of him. The sages curse his Linga to fall off and it becomes the infinite pillar. Brahma and Vishnu propitiate him and Shiva reabsorbs the Linga into his body. In another instance, while passing the Deodar Forest, Parvati notices sages who worship Shiva and have emaciated their bodies with fasts and severe vows. Parvati requests Shiva to save them from further pain, but Shiva declares that the sages are simply foolish and have not restrained their passion and anger. He enters the forest as a <b>handsome</b> <b>man,</b> wearing only a garland of sylvan flowers. He entices the sages' wives, who give him alms. As before, the Linga of the cursed Shiva falls off, but eventually the sages realise their folly and worship the Linga. Similar accounts of Bhikshatana-Shiva's visit to the Deodar Forest to humble and enlighten the false sages, Bhikshatana-Shiva's emasculation and establishment of Linga worship also appear in the Mahabharata, the Shiva Purana, and the Bhagavata Purana.|$|E

5|$|Aurora {{debuted in}} Sleeping Beauty (1959) as the newborn only {{daughter}} of King Stefan and Queen Leah. Angered by not receiving {{an invitation to}} her christening, the princess is cursed by an evil fairy named Maleficent, who dooms her to die when she pricks her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel on her 16th birthday. However, one of three good fairies named Merryweather alters the curse so that Aurora will instead sleep until she is awoken by a kiss from her true love. Merryweather and the two other fairies, Flora and Fauna, take extra precautions by raising the princess in a secluded cottage under the alias Briar Rose {{to protect her from}} Maleficent until her birthday arrives. Several years later, a 16-year-old Aurora meets a <b>handsome</b> <b>man</b> in the forest. Unaware that he is actually a prince named Phillip, to whom she has been betrothed since infancy, the two fall in love and agree to meet again. However, the fairies finally reveal Aurora's true identity to her and thus forbid her from seeing him because they plan on returning the heartbroken princess to her parents. While alone at their castle, Aurora is hypnotized by Maleficent, who causes her to prick her finger and fulfill Merryweather's prophecy. She was then placed in the highest tower to sleep peacefully until the spell was broken. Meanwhile, Maleficent has captured Phillip, who the fairies release upon realizing that he is in fact the same man Aurora met in the forest earlier that day. Helping him defeat Maleficent, Aurora is successfully awoken by Phillip's kiss, and finally reunited with her parents.|$|E
25|$|George III came to {{the throne}} in 1760, and in 1762 his friend Bute became prime minister. As a statesman, Bute was massively unpopular with the English, {{for a variety of}} reasons. He was a Scot, a Royal favourite, and a <b>handsome</b> <b>man</b> who was lampooned for his vanity, and was {{constantly}} the butt of biting political satire, scandal, and gossip. This included frequent allegations of an affair with Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha (1719–1772), the widow of Frederick, Prince of Wales. Bute's ministry fell in 1763, when his daughter Louisa was five years old, and Bute retired from public life to Luton Hoo and thereafter devoted himself to botany, horticulture and other country pursuits.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, de Beauplan {{grew tired}} of Ambre's {{frequent}} absences and their difficult relationship and left Meudon to settle in Montpellier. He died there in February 1890. He was 41 {{years old at the}} time of his death and addicted to morphine. In June of that year, Ambre formally recognized the eight-year-old Robert as her son. She retired from the stage and opened a singing school in Paris with Émile Bouichère. A <b>handsome</b> <b>man</b> twelve years her junior, Bouichère was an organist and composer who served as the maître de chapelle of Sainte-Trinité church. The couple married in 1894, but Bouichère died a year later at the age of 35. After Bouichère's death, Ambre continued with her singing school and musical soirees but led an increasingly lonely life.|$|E

He then appears first as a <b>handsome</b> <b>man</b> {{and then as a}} beautiful boy. Years later, he approaches Arthur disguised as a peasant wearing leather boots, a wool coat, a hood, and a belt of knotted sheepskin.

He unsuccessfully tried to overcome his alcoholism, lost two marriages to divorce, struggled to hold a job, and it was said that he could be found outside Maple Leaf Gardens trying to sell broken sticks of Maple Leaf players to try to make some money. He emerged as one of hockey's tragic figures.|$|E

500|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears {{telling a story}} about a very famous Hollywood actress named Lucky. Lucky is seen wearing a pink nightgown behind the curtains, {{standing}} on her billboard with fluffy white cotton balls attached to the edges, inside her mansion and shots of her out on the balcony. As beautiful and rich as she is, on set she sits on the star-shape in the sky, as she is acting, she is looking quite distressed. After the first chorus, she goes to the hotel mansion to the flowers, then she leaves and sits down and gets a mirror. Next, Lucky opens the door to reveal a <b>handsome</b> <b>man,</b> who then takes her in his arms, as the director yells [...] "Cut! We've got it". Lucky then walks off-set into the studio, replying to the director: [...] "Finally! We've done it fifty-million times!" [...] She then goes to have her hair and makeup done; with Spears standing unnoticed and very worried looking by her side. Lucky is then seen in a shiny gray evening gown at the Academy Awards accepting her award for Best Actress. Lucky looks happy as she accepts it and smiles at her fans but is soon revealed that this is not true happiness. She makes her way away from her screaming fans and back into her limo, where she unexpectedly finds an ornate hand mirror that was used on the film set. She looks back to the crowd to see who has left it and sees Spears leaning forward in the crowd. The limo drives away, leaving Spears behind on the red carpet. The video ends with Lucky crying herself to sleep, her make-up already stained on her face. The curtains close, ending the video.|$|E
500|$|Kim Manners {{was pleased}} with the episode; he noted that he [...] "felt it was a very {{interesting}} character study". He later called it [...] "one of my favorite episodes". Frank Spotnitz considered [...] "Milagro" [...] to have been an [...] "underappreciated" [...] episode. For this reason, it was later included on the X-Files Essentials DVD compilation, along with seven other episodes. Scully's portrayal in the episode was given special attention. Stegall noted that [...] "if 'Milagro' has one message about perception, it is shown in Scully, who is seen through everyone's eyes (Mulder, Padgett, even Naciamento) but her own. Ultimately, we can't know which ones of these portraits of her character are 'right'. Maybe none of them are. It's a bravura performance from Gillian Anderson, well matched by Duchovny's low-key Mulder, acting on his instincts.". Handlen argued that the episode reduces Scully [...] "to a victim waiting to find out which <b>handsome</b> <b>man</b> will rescue her." [...] Elyce Rae Helford, in her book Fantasy Girls: Gender in the New Universe of Science Fiction and Fantasy Television, accused the show of [...] "reinforc the stereotype [...] of independent women as lonely, neurotic, and nostalgic for sexual attention from men." [...] Anderson herself felt that the character needed to [...] "loosen up". She was once approached by a fan who applauded Scully as the [...] "epitome of womanhood" [...] because she is a character who [...] "not only can kick ass but she [...] works with Mulder without jumping him." [...] Anderson, in return jokingly replied, [...] "So the epitome of womanhood is sexual restraint? [...] I don't think so." [...] The episode was particularly analyzed by fans of the show, and the fact that Scully was almost seduced provoked [...] "lively internet discussion".|$|E
