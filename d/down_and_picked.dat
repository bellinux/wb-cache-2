25|$|By {{the end of}} the evening, he was in Đà Lạt {{when his}} plane had no fuel left, and no pumps were open at the time, so he was marooned there for the night. Fearing a Khánh comeback, the AFC met again and {{unanimously}} resolved to make contingency plans to repel any counter-insurrection by Khánh. Westmoreland sent Colonel Wilson, Khánh's former confidant, to go to the military airport at Đà Lạt to convince the Vietnamese general to resign and allow a new military leadership to take the reins. Khánh finally agreed to leave if he was given a dignified send-off, so the other generals arranged a ceremony at Tan Son Nhut, where military bands serenaded him. He theatrically bent <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> up some loose dirt before putting it in his pocket, saying that he was taking his beloved homeland with him. His enemies, the remaining Vietnamese officers and Taylor, all met him at the airport. He then left as Ambassador-at-Large, and was sent on a world tour, starting with a report at the United Nations in New York City.|$|E
25|$|After {{thoroughly}} {{cleaning the}} diamond, the diamond {{is picked up}} using tweezers in a girdle-to-girdle hold. The grader views the diamond {{for the first time}} through the table, studying the culet area of the stone for inclusions. The diamond is then set <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> up with the tweezers in a table-to-culet hold. In this position, the diamond can be studied from the pavilion side, and the crown side, examining the diamond through each facet for inclusions. Once a sector of the diamond has been thoroughly examined, the grader rotates the diamond in the tweezer, so that the neighboring sector can be examined. The grader uses darkfield lighting to reveal characteristics, and alternates to reflected, overhead lighting to ascertain whether a characteristic lies within the stone, on the stones surface, or both. If the grader is using a stereo microscope, she may zoom in to a higher magnification to make closer observations of an inclusion, but then return to 10x magnification to make an assessment of its impact on the clarity grade.|$|E
500|$|At around 16:15, Linge ordered SS-Untersturmführer Heinz Krüger and SS-Oberscharführer Werner Schwiedel {{to roll up}} the rug in Hitler's {{study to}} burn it. Schwiedel later stated that upon {{entering}} the study, he saw {{a pool of blood}} the size of a [...] "large dinner plate" [...] by the arm-rest of the sofa. Noticing a spent cartridge case, he bent <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> it up from where it lay on the rug about 1mm from a 7.65 pistol. The two men removed the blood-stained rug, carried it up the stairs and outside to the Chancellery garden. There the rug was placed on the ground and burned.|$|E
60|$|The captain bent <b>down</b> <b>and,</b> <b>picking</b> a used match {{from the}} hearthrug, threw it {{carefully}} under the grate. Miss Drewitt watched him expectantly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll drop <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> a bouquet," [...] he exclaimed, and a {{few moments}} later his feet touched the firm earth of the island.|$|R
60|$|Trent stooped <b>down</b> <b>and,</b> <b>picking</b> up the knife, cut {{the bonds}} which had bound the boy. He {{staggered}} {{up to his}} feet with a weak, little laugh.|$|R
500|$|Khánh {{finally agreed}} to leave if {{he was given a}} dignified send-off, so the other generals {{arranged}} a ceremonial farewell at Tan Son Nhut on February 24. Military bands played as he theatrically bent <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> up some loose dirt before putting it in his pocket; Khánh said he was taking his beloved homeland with him, and vowed to one day return. His enemies, the remaining Vietnamese officers, most notably Kỳ and Thi, as well as Taylor, all met him at the airport. The foes managed smiles and handshakes for the media cameras. To make the coup [...] "appear as much as possible the doing of Vietnamese themselves", Taylor had not made any public statement after Khánh’s ouster, on orders from the State Department. Wearing his Grand Cross of the National Order, and carrying two more plastic bags filled with Vietnamese soil, Khánh then left as Ambassador-at-Large, and was sent on a meaningless world tour, starting with a report to the United Nations in New York City.|$|E
2500|$|After being {{attacked}} by multiple church members, Sheriff Deputy Ray Thatcher was confronted by William Thomas Jr. carrying a rifle. [...] Thatcher, who was the designated SWAT sniper for {{the day of the}} shootout, fired his Ruger Mini-14 semi-automatic sniper's rifle from close range, killing William Thomas Jr. and Aruguster Tate (Thomas Jr.'s father-in-law) during the shootout. [...] Thatcher claimed Thomas circled around him pointing a cocked rifle at him, while facing him, before Thatcher fired. [...] Thatcher claimed that Tate then stooped <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> up Thomas's rifle and pointed it at Thatcher before he fired. [...] Thatcher admitted to shooting both men, each of whom was struck with four bullets. [...] Of the reported hundreds of firearms rounds fired during the shootout, the only ones reported to be from law enforcement officers were those of Deputy Townsend and a single shot from Deputy Rothrock.|$|E
60|$|But Kent {{had ceased}} to listen. He had {{suddenly}} stooped <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> up something off the floor.|$|E
5000|$|Dedicated bus lanes, where buses, taxi, {{and private}} rental cars are only allowed to drive, this reduces {{congestion}} with set <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> up of passengers, and normal commuters ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Baker," [...] said Charley, with {{infinite}} gravity, [...] "if {{that bag}} SHOULD TUMBLE OFF A DOZEN TIMES between this and Laurel Hill, I'll hop <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> it up myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I hoped {{there would}} be a lord; it's just like a novel!" [...] And then, [...] "Oh you adorable creature!" [...] she {{suddenly}} cried, stooping <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picking</b> up the small dog again.|$|R
60|$|Inspector French stooped <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> up the paper-weight. Across it was stamped {{the name}} of Sanford Quest.|$|E
60|$|Her words {{seemed to}} bring him back to his old self. He stooped <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> up his cap.|$|E
60|$|She leaned <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> up a sea-fishing rod. Jacob {{was terrified}} {{as he saw}} her swaying {{backwards}} and forwards.|$|E
6000|$|At that Montgomery stopped. [...] "Good God!" [...] said he, stooping <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>picking</b> {{up some of}} {{the crushed}} {{vertebrae}} to examine them more closely. [...] "Good God!" [...] he repeated, [...] "what can this mean?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Oh, what a {{screaming}} {{and what a}} fighting! How many sorts there are! What are those beautiful little ones, like great white swallows, with crested heads and forked tails, who hover, <b>and</b> then dip <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> up something? ...|$|R
6000|$|To their {{surprise}} Mr. Nott stooped <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>picking</b> {{up one of}} {{the coins}} handed it gravely to Renshaw. [...] "Would ye mind heftin' that 'ere coin in your hand--feelin' it, bitin' it, scrapin' it with a knife, and kinder seein' how it compares with other coins?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You did it!"' Steven bent <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> up the box. He {{carried it}} over to the guide-light, sitting down on the curb to examine it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Stay!' {{cried the}} horse, 'do not throw them away! Perhaps we shall find them of use. Get down and pick them up.' So Petru got <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> them up, {{and they all}} went on.|$|E
60|$|Nikasti made no reply. Lutchester {{looked at}} him for a moment thoughtfully. There was a light once more in the beaten man's eyes--a queer, secretive gleam. Lutchester stooped <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> up the knife from the floor.|$|E
50|$|When the lamp-work flame was introduced, beadmakers {{discovered}} they could melt the canes and blow the glass. Today this glassblowing {{is called the}} Filigrana or filigree method. To produce these beads with stripes of color and spirals, glassmakers lay canes of glass <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> them up with a blow-pipe.|$|R
5000|$|... "In a Little Spanish Town" [...] {{includes}} audience participation, {{which was}} worked into the stage version of their {{act in a}} humorous way. Alpert would ask the audience to clap hands twice {{at the end of}} each bar of the chorus. On stage, trombonist Bob Edmondson would attempt to join the hand-clapping, having to hurriedly put <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> up his trombone each time.|$|R
50|$|Just {{outside the}} museum is the Union Pacific Semaphore. Built in 1920 in Swissvale, Pennsylvania, this style B lower {{quadrant}} semaphore was originally located in Nephi, Utah along the Union Pacific Railroad line. It was used to signal trains to either slow <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> up orders, or proceed to the next signal. It is said that the design of traffic stoplights were adopted from this type of device.|$|R
6000|$|So we [...] "trotted" [...] at no mean pace. As {{we passed}} it, Bastin stooped <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> up {{the head of}} the image of Oro, much as Atalanta in Academy {{pictures}} is represented as doing to the apples, and bore it away in triumph.|$|E
60|$|They were {{standing}} almost {{in front of}} it. The gate was open and Tavernake beat against the panels {{with the flat of}} his hand. Then, with a cry of triumph, he stooped <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> something up from a crack in the flagged stones.|$|E
60|$|Father {{picked up}} the ten-cent tip. With loathing he {{threw it in the}} fireplace. Then went, knelt <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> it out again. Mother would need all the money he could get for her in the coming wintry days of failure--failure he himself had brought upon her.|$|E
50|$|When a {{major event}} occurs at Wembley Stadium, all London Midland {{services}} call here always stopping at platforms 5 and 6. Virgin Trains' services are formed of trains which are too long for the platforms and take longer to set <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> up. As a result, these services will make additional stops at Watford Junction or Milton Keynes, for customers to change onto London Midland or Southern services.|$|R
40|$|Having {{just put}} aside the silver plectrum, She sits <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picks</b> up the gilded needle. To make drawing lots she writes in small {{standard}} script, Competing at gathering flowers she breaks her delicate nails. They are easy to turn over but it’s {{hard to know what}} they express. They can reach out so one doesn’t object to their softness. Holding a golden shuttle, she weaves by the loom, Close-fitting sleeves conceal slenderness. ...|$|R
6000|$|Two of the {{men went}} <b>down</b> <b>and</b> {{borrowed}} <b>picks</b> <b>and</b> shovels. In half-an-hour they returned to their tents, having finished their task. The meal was prepared in silence. When they sat down, Mason said-- ...|$|R
60|$|He sat <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> three flowers, {{and held}} them to his nostrils, and inhaled their fragrance. Then he put them to his mouth, and I saw his strong white teeth crush them. He chewed {{them for a while}} without speaking; then he spat them out and {{gathered}} more.|$|E
60|$|With this {{he began}} to march {{along the road to}} the opening in the rocks ahead, and the others kept close behind him. But the Scoodlers closed up in front, as if to bar their way, and so the shaggy man stooped <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> up a loose stone, which he threw at the creatures to scare them from the path.|$|E
6000|$|... "She was so old," [...] {{explained}} the Witch of the North, [...] "that she dried up {{quickly in the}} sun. That {{is the end of}} her. But the silver shoes are yours, and you shall have them to wear." [...] She reached <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> up the shoes, and after shaking the dust out of them handed them to Dorothy.|$|E
50|$|Finally, in {{the most}} memorable scene, Tom takes all the grass around the outdoor fireplace, sets it in there and sets it on fire, causing smoke to just about blanket the sky. Afterwards, he grabs a {{lawnmower}} and mows a strip in the field, then lines the strip with Christmas lights, illuminates them, then waits {{at the end of}} the strip with his mouth open. However, instead of the bird, a jet airliner comes <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>picks</b> Tom up by his mouth.|$|R
60|$|Uncle Palladius was {{the head}} of a large family, and as strangers were rare in their Valley they all {{gathered}} around the girl and looked at her curiously, while one pure white kitten came softly up and rubbed its back against Dot's leg. She stooped <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>picking</b> up the pretty kitten snuggled it close in her arms and gently caressed it. Then she sat down upon a cushion, while the other kittens gathered around her or stretched themselves lazily upon the carpet near by.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{all very}} well, my dear," [...] said Mrs Tom, [...] "and of course so shall I. But {{as she has}} taken the charge of the child I don't think she ought to drop her <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> her up just {{whenever}} she pleases. Suppose she was to take it into her head {{to stop at the}} Cedars altogether, what are we to do then?--just have the girl returned upon our hands, with all her ideas of life confused and deranged. I hate such ways." ...|$|R
