Dew falling on grass, flower and spray (traditional imagery, {{deriving}} from OT texts such as Psalm 72:6) suggests ease, grace and delicacy generally (not progressive stages of insemination).

He and opponent Cristiano Ronaldo had <b>gone</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> match as joint top scorers in the tournament, and thus Costa's eighth goal made him the top scorer.|$|E

5|$|The 2005season marks {{only the}} eighthtime in 50years that exactly twoteams have <b>gone</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bowl season undefeated. This {{has been a}} major {{criticism}} of the BCS format, which does not use a playoff to determine the national championship. Unless there are exactly two unbeaten teams, both from BCS conferences, the choice of the top twoteams can generate controversy. If more than twoundefeated teams remain, then one or more of those teams must be left out. If one or fewer undefeated teams remain, then an opponent must be chosen from among the one-loss teams, meaning that other one-loss teams will be left out.|$|E
5|$|Arbroath has one {{professional}} football team, Arbroath, who play in Scottish League One, the third tier of the Scottish Professional Football League. Arbroath play their home matches at Gayfield Park, which holds {{the record for}} being the closest stadium to the sea in European football (around 5½ yards from the high tide line). Arbroath holds the world record for the largest winning margin in a senior football match, 36–0, in their Scottish Cup match against Bon Accord (a scratch team from Aberdeen) on 12 September 1885. Further goals were disallowed either for offside, or {{because it was not}} clear whether the ball had <b>gone</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> goal. For this reason the AFC supporters' club is called the 36–0 club in memory of this event. Arbroath are nicknamed the Red Lichties, owing to the red light that used to guide fishing boats back from the North Sea to the harbour (Lichtie being a Scots word for light). Arbroath and the surrounding areas are home to several amateur senior and junior teams competing in the various amateur leagues, such as Arbroath Victoria and Arbroath SC.|$|E
5|$|Despite their highly {{technical}} backgrounds, Tech {{graduates are}} no strangers to athletics; approximately 150 Tech students have <b>gone</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> NFL, with many others {{going into the}} NBA or MLB.

5|$|During this period, Hipper {{organized}} {{the office of}} Befehlshabers der Sicherung der Nordsee (BSNCommander of the Defense of the North Sea), which was also stationed on Niobe. In 1917, she was disarmed so her guns {{could be used to}} reinforce the defenses of Wilhelmshaven. In October that year, Konteradmiral Friedrich Boedicker, then the commander of the I Squadron, came aboard Niobe; the bulk of the High Seas Fleet had <b>gone</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Baltic to launch Operation Albion, and Boedicker temporarily took control of the BSN. Hipper and his staff left Niobe on 11 August 1918, having been promoted to command of the High Seas Fleet. The BSN remained aboard Niobe until January 1919, two months after the war ended with the Armistice; it was then transferred to the old pre-dreadnought battleship , also in use as a headquarters ship. Niobe was then decommissioned on 3 February.|$|E
5|$|Allardyce {{was offered}} the Manchester City job, but the offer was {{withdrawn}} after Thaksin Shinawatra's purchase offer of the club was accepted. On 15 May 2007, Newcastle United announced that Allardyce had signed a three-year contract to succeed Glenn Roeder as manager. Ironically Newcastle then also {{had a change of}} owners, as Mike Ashley completed his takeover of the club. The sales of Scott Parker and Kieron Dyer raised £13million, allowing Allardyce to sign Australia international striker Mark Viduka (free transfer), utility man Alan Smith (£6million), midfielder Geremi Njitap, controversial midfielder Joey Barton (£5.5million), left-back José Enrique (£6.3million), right-back Habib Beye (£2million), and defender Abdoulaye Faye. Newcastle enjoyed a good start to the season, beating Allardyce's former club Bolton 3–1 on the opening day in a run of five wins and two draws from the opening nine league games. However they then had a series of disappointing results in the run-up to Christmas, and after gaining only one point from a possible six from bottom-of-the-table Wigan and Derby. Allardyce parted company with Newcastle United on 9 January 2008. He had <b>gone</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> meeting with chairman Chris Mort expecting to be told Newcastle had signed a new player, not expecting that Ashley and Mort had decided to instead sign Kevin Keegan to return as manager.|$|E

5|$|By about 05:00, Dyck's {{ammunition}} {{supplies were}} running low, and the ZIPRA attackers {{had hit the}} Alamo {{a number of times}} with RPG fire. Nobody inside was killed by these rockets, but when Dyck's dog was wounded, the major flew into a rage and ordered his men to pour more aggressive machine gun fire on the advancing ZIPRA combatants. He requested air support from Brigade HQ {{in the form of a}} Lynx light bomber. The air force turned down the request, but Flight Lieutenant Colin James took off anyway in his Lynx armed with an FN MAG machine gun and SNEB rockets. The ZIPRA cadres concentrated a huge amount of fire on James' aircraft, and hit it several times, but failed to shoot it down; the pilot put in a number of ground attacks before returning to base. He reported afterwards that a bullet had entered through the floor of his cockpit and hit his helmet. The 1RAR officers and men expressed great admiration for James's bravery during this air strike, but his air force superiors were furious that he had <b>gone</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> operational area against orders.|$|E
5|$|Desperate Housewives {{focuses on}} the lives of several {{residents}} on the suburban neighborhood of Wisteria Lane. In recent episodes, Susan Mayer (Teri Hatcher) has encouraged a stripper Robin Gallagher (Julie Benz) to quit her job and turn her life around. Robin briefly lived with Susan, but moved out after Susan became jealous of Robin living in the same house as her husband, Mike Delfino (James Denton). Robin moved in with Katherine Mayfair (Dana Delany) and revealed she was a lesbian, prompting the heterosexual Katherine to start developing romantic feelings for Robin. Lynette (Felicity Huffman) is pregnant, despite being a middle-aged career woman and already having four children. This has caused strain for Lynette and her husband, Tom Scavo (Doug Savant). Bree (Marcia Cross) is the ambitious owner of a catering company, and her son Andrew (Shawn Pyfrom) works as her personal assistant. Angie (Drea de Matteo) and Nick Bolen (Jeffrey Nordling) recently moved onto Wisteria Lane to escape circumstances in their old home of New York City that are yet to be fully explained. Gabrielle and her husband Carlos Solis (Ricardo Antonio Chavira) overheard the Bolens arguing about their circumstances, and have grown concerned about their niece Ana (Maiara Walsh) dating the Bolens' son, Danny (Beau Mirchoff). As a result, they convinced Ana to leave Danny and pursue her modeling career in New York City, but Danny has secretly <b>gone</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> city to find her.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} realized {{early on}} that issues relating to time would be {{an essential part of}} its case. At trial, each side presented witnesses to support their version of the timeline for the hours before and after the murder. The starting point was the time of death; the prosecution, relying on the analysis of stomach contents by their expert witness, argued that Phagan died between 12:00 and 12:15p.m. A prosecution witness, Monteen Stover, said she had <b>gone</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> office to get her paycheck, waiting there from 12:05 to 12:10, and did not see Frank in his office. The prosecution's theory was that Stover did not see Frank because he was at that time murdering Phagan. Stover's account did not match Frank's initial account that he had not left the office between noon and 12:30. Other testimony indicated that Phagan exited the trolley (or tram) between 12:07 and 12:10. From the stop it was a two- to four-minute walk, suggesting that Stover arrived first, making her testimony and its implications irrelevant: Frank could not be killing Phagan because at the time she had not yet arrived.|$|E
