40|$|BACKGROUND: Cross-sectional survey {{research}} elicited self-perceptions <b>of</b> role <b>competence</b> from practicing psychiatric mental health nurse practitioners (PMHNPs) and new PMHNP graduates. OBJECTIVES: Examine relationships between PMHNP perceptions <b>of</b> <b>competence,</b> prior basic-level nursing experience, {{and years of}} PMHNP practice. STUDY DESIGN: Self-ratings <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> were elicited by a questionnaire designed from Benner’s model. The relationship between prior nursing experience and perceptions <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> was examined by chi-square analysis. Changes in PMHNP competence rankings over years of practice were examined with Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney procedures. RESULTS: Self-perceptions <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> increased in seven role dimensions as PMHNPs progressed through years of practice (p <. 000). Gains in perceptions <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> occurred between career entry and 3 to 5 years of practice {{in all but one}} role dimension.

40|$|Although {{competence}} {{is an important}} concept in human resource develop-ment and education, there is no theoretical framework for competence. This article focuses {{on the development of}} such a theoretical framework. It proposes the boundary approach <b>of</b> <b>competence,</b> an aid to support human resource managers and educationalists in thinking about the concept <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> and in defining it properly. Here, the concept <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> is being explored by focusing on its dimensions and by identifying differ-ences with related terms. The boundary approach <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> heavily depends on a constructivist point of view. This holds that the quest for one absolute meaning <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> is being abandoned and that instead com-petence definitions are being valued against their degree of viability.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore the {{vocabulary}} <b>of</b> <b>competence,</b> to analyse conceptualisations <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> and to unravel understandings that then have implications for preparation and professional development of teachers in Scotland. Through discussion of the context for assessing teacher competence and a presentation of the accountability movement’s proposals for criteria that purport to measure teacher <b>competence,</b> differing conceptualisations <b>of</b> teaching are examined. At {{one end of the}} spectrum there are conceptions of teaching as a dialectical activity while at the opposite end there are conceptions of teaching as a mechanistic activity. It is the contention of this thesis that the conceptualisation <b>of</b> teacher <b>competence</b> reflects directly on the conceptualisation of teaching that dominates current political thinking on the purposes of education. An analysis of the discourse <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> and the vocabulary <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> is then revelatory of the underlying dimensions and conceptualisations of teaching held by the ‘leadership class’ or ‘policy community’. Following a lengthy critique of alternative conceptions <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> where it is realised that there is little real consensus – even among advocates <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> approaches to training and education – about what constitutes a definitive conceptualisation <b>of</b> <b>competence,</b> there is an attempt to regain ground through an understanding <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> that accords with a more traditional understanding of what the ‘notion <b>of</b> competence’ implies. <b>Competence</b> in this regard is considered as a deep understanding that is actually constitutive of action.
