The second and third chapters look at the negative divine - the characterisation of God as void, silence or non-being - which Stace maintains is an idea found in all religions. He maintains that mystical experience is shared by all mankind, {{it is only the}} theories about it that differ. On this point he says he is in agreement with Otto. In this experience the distinction between subject and object is overcome, indeed there is no difference between the <b>experiencer</b> and the experience.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the historical evolution of {{three types of}} Spanish collocations formed with entrar and state nouns: with dative <b>experiencers</b> (e. g. le entró temor), with subject <b>experiencers</b> (e. g. el caballero entró en temor), and with locative <b>experiencers</b> (e. g. entró temor en él). The locative construction, which predominated initially, was eclipsed by the subject structure in the 1600 s, but datives prevail since the 1800 s. This evolution follows from other, more general changes in Spanish, particularly the victory of dative <b>experiencers</b> in constructions indicating involuntary physical or mental processes...|$|R

25|$|Like {{a number}} of other theories, the Multiple Drafts model understands {{conscious}} experience as taking time to occur, such that percepts do not instantaneously arise in the mind in their full richness.

There is no central <b>experiencer</b> who confers a durable stamp of approval on any particular draft.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{argues for}} {{incorporating}} a radically increased awareness {{and understanding of}} the experiences and opinions of people who actually watch films into any film theory or criticism genuinely concerned to analyse, evaluate or otherwise interpret films and/or those who watch them. In particular, it suggests {{there is a need to}} re-think the status of film <b>experiencers</b> as informants who are participant in rather than objects of study, and that an ethnographic approach should be taken to narrow the gap between film studies and film <b>experiencers.</b> Initially, I investigate ways in which film "viewers" and "audiences" have been and continue to be theorized, analyzed and represented, with emphases both on how film theory and criticism have treated film <b>experiencers,</b> and on the impact of the recent "ethnographic turn" in film and cultural studies. I then investigate pertinent ethnographic theories and methods in the context of recent debates about knowledge production and reflexivity, looking particularly at postmodern and anti-patriarchal critiques. I also consider the relationship between ethnography and cultural studies, and how both these areas impact on the study of film <b>experiencers.</b> Ultimately I suggest particular ways in which ethnographic theories and methods might be used in film studies to inform investigations, understandings and therefore representations of film <b>experiencers.</b> I outline and consider how my case study uses such approaches before setting out the case study itself. The case study sets out what sixty-seven participant-informants had to say and write about martial arts action films, and is in large part intended to "give voice" to film <b>experiencers.</b> But while the emphasis is on citing participant-informants' own words, I recognize that there is no description without interpretation and reflect on this in the conclusions I draw from the case study "data" and my theoretical work...|$|R
2500|$|Affective clauses {{have either}} verbs of {{perception}} or psychological verbs as predicate. Those verbs are for example: [...] "be bored/bother", [...] "become known", [...] "find", [...] "forget", [...] "hate", [...] "hear", [...] "know", [...] "love/like", [...] "miss", [...] "see", etc. The <b>experiencer</b> (which {{would be the}} subject in the corresponding English sentence) is usually in the dative case, while the stimulus (the object in the English sentence) takes the absolutive case.|$|E
2500|$|Buddhism {{posits that}} there is no inherent, unchanging {{identity}} (Inherent I, Inherent Me) or phenomena (Ultimate self, inherent self, Atman, Soul, Self-essence, Jiva, Ishvara, humanness essence, etc.) which is the <b>experiencer</b> of our experiences and the agent of our actions. In other words, human beings consist of merely a body and a mind, and nothing extra. Within the body there is no part or set of parts which is - by itself or themselves - the person. Similarly, within the mind there is no part or set of parts which are themselves [...] "the person". A human being merely consists of five aggregates, or skandhas and nothing else.|$|E
2500|$|This {{is because}} Georgian has yet {{another level of}} split ergativity. In the aorist series, intransitive verbs behave differently. Second {{conjugation}} verbs behave as would normally be expected in an ergative language: the subject is declined in the least-marked case, the nominative case (terminologically equivalent in this instance to absolutive cases in other languages). Third conjugation verbs behave as if they belonged to an accusative system: the most-marked case (the ergative) marks the subject. The division between second and third conjugations is a convenient way to remember the difference, but in fact they both contain intransitive verbs, and as a whole the behaviour of these verbs follows an active alignment. In an active language, intranstive verbs are subdivided into two classes. The division is usually based on semantic criteria regarding {{the nature of the}} subject and the verb; for example, if the subject identifies an agent (an active or intentional performer of the action of the verb), then it might be marked with one case (e.g. the ergative), while if the subject identifies an <b>experiencer</b> of the event or one who does not actively initiate it, then it might be marked with another case (e.g. the absolutive or nominative). What might be called the [...] "most active" [...] case, then, marks the subject of a transitive verb, while the [...] "least active" [...] or [...] "most patientive" [...] case is that used to mark a direct object. This is precisely what happens in Georgian, in the restricted environment of the second or third conjugation verbs in the aorist series.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study we {{examined}} the role of four specific forms of reappraisal in people's overestimation of their future experiences of anger and sadness. Results show that forecasters predicted to experience more intense anger and sadness following social exclusion than <b>experiencers</b> actually felt. This impact bias was shown in both the overall intensity of these emotions and their associated response tendencies. Results also show that forecasters indicated less reappraisal of the situation than <b>experiencers</b> actually employ. Moreover, for <b>experiencers,</b> reappraisal (i. e., relativisation) of social exclusion decreased their experience of anger, whereas forecasters' predicted reappraisal {{was not related to}} their forecasted experience of anger. These findings add importantly to earlier research by indicating how a specific emotion regulatory process (i. e., reappraisal) is related to the impact bias in affective forecasting...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose that}} affective forecasters {{overestimate}} {{the extent to}} which experienced hedonic responses to an outcome are influenced by the probability of its occurrence. The experience of an outcome (e. g., winning a gamble) is typically more affectively intense than the simulation of that outcome (e. g., imagining winning a gamble) upon which the affective forecast for it is based. We suggest that, as a result, <b>experiencers</b> allocate a larger share of their attention toward the outcome (e. g., winning the gamble) and less to its probability specifications than do affective forecasters. Consequently, hedonic responses to an outcome are less sensitive to its probability specifications than are affective forecasts for that outcome. The results of 6 experiments provide support for our theory. Affective forecasters overestimated how sensitive <b>experiencers</b> would be to the probability of positive and negative outcomes (Experiments 1 and 2). Consistent with our attentional account, differences in sensitivity to probability specifications disappeared when the attention of forecasters was diverted from probability specifications (Experiment 3) or when the attention of <b>experiencers</b> was drawn toward probability specifications (Experiment 4). Finally, differences in sensitivity to probability specifications between forecasters and <b>experiencers</b> were diminished when the forecasted outcome was more affectively intense (Experiments 5 and 6) ...|$|R
