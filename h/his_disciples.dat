5|$|In the Synoptics, Jesus and <b>his</b> <b>disciples</b> go to {{the garden}} Gethsemane, where Jesus prays to be spared his coming ordeal. Then Judas comes with an armed mob, sent by the chief priests, scribes and elders. He kisses Jesus to {{identify}} him to the crowd, which then arrests Jesus. In an attempt to stop them, an unnamed disciple of Jesus uses a sword {{to cut off the}} ear of a man in the crowd. After Jesus' arrest, <b>his</b> <b>disciples</b> go into hiding, and Peter, when questioned, thrice denies knowing Jesus. After the third denial, Peter hears the rooster crow and recalls Jesus' prediction about his denial. Peter then weeps bitterly.|$|E
5|$|Once {{written by}} Shatanand Swami, {{this book was}} {{verified}} and authenticated by Swaminarayan. He was much pleased to read the book. Swaminarayan then asked <b>his</b> <b>disciples</b> to do Katha of Satsangi Jeevan.|$|E
5|$|In Mark, Salome and Mary, {{mother of}} James are with Mary Magdalene (Mark 16:1). In the tomb, {{a young man}} in a white robe (an angel) tells them that Jesus will meet <b>his</b> <b>disciples</b> in Galilee, as he had told them (referring to Mark 14:28).|$|E
50|$|On {{reaching}} Tanjavar, he {{was received}} by Vyankojiraje, {{the brother of}} Shree Shivaji Maharaj, the King of Tanjavar. Shree Samarth accepted him as <b>his</b> <b>disciple.</b> At Tanjavar, revered religious figure Pundit Raghunath became <b>his</b> <b>disciple.</b>|$|R

50|$|With {{regard to}} his {{activity}} with altarpieces, one must emphasize well-documented baroque features {{in his work}} such as the altarpiece of Mercy (1748-51), completed by <b>his</b> <b>disciple</b> named Gregorio, {{as well as the}} altarpiece Moderno del Carmen, which is attributed to <b>his</b> <b>disciple</b> and Legarda Jacinto Lopez.|$|R
5|$|In Mark, {{the disciples}} play hardly any role {{other than a}} {{negative}} one. While others sometimes respond to Jesus with complete faith, <b>his</b> <b>disciples</b> are puzzled and doubtful. They serve as a foil to Jesus and to other characters. The failings of the disciples are probably exaggerated in Mark, and the disciples make a better showing in Matthew and Luke.|$|E
5|$|John lacks {{scenes from}} the synoptics such as Jesus' baptism, the calling of the Twelve, exorcisms, parables, the Transfiguration, and the Last Supper. Conversely, it {{includes}} scenes {{not found in the}} synoptics, including Jesus turning water into wine at the wedding at Cana, the resurrection of Lazarus, Jesus washing the feet of <b>his</b> <b>disciples,</b> and multiple visits to Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|On 4 July 1902 (the {{day of his}} death) Vivekananda awoke early, went to {{the monastery}} at Belur Math and meditated for three hours. He taught Shukla-Yajur-Veda, Sanskrit grammar and the {{philosophy}} of yoga to pupils, later discussing with colleagues a planned Vedic college in the Ramakrishna Math. At 7:00p.m. Vivekananda went to his room, asking not to be disturbed; he died at 9:10p.m. while meditating. According to <b>his</b> <b>disciples,</b> Vivekananda attained mahasamādhi; the rupture of a blood vessel in his brain was reported as a possible cause of death. <b>His</b> <b>disciples</b> believed that the rupture was due to his brahmarandhra (an opening in the crown of his head) being pierced when he attained mahasamādhi. Vivekananda fulfilled his prophecy {{that he would not}} live forty years. He was cremated on a sandalwood funeral pyre {{on the bank of the}} Ganga in Belur, opposite where Ramakrishna was cremated sixteen years earlier.|$|E

50|$|It is, however, {{all part}} of Wang's scheme: he is {{secretly}} protecting Ho from the police, and is training the bumbling Ho as <b>his</b> <b>disciple</b> and bodyguard.

5|$|On {{his return}} to Edo {{in the winter of}} 1691, Bashō lived in his third bashō hut, again {{provided}} by <b>his</b> <b>disciples.</b> This time, he was not alone: he took in a nephew and his female friend, Jutei, who were both recovering from illness. He had a great many visitors.|$|E
5|$|The cheering crowds {{greeting}} Jesus as {{he enters}} Jerusalem add to the animosity {{between him and the}} establishment. In John, Jesus has already cleansed the Second Temple during an earlier Passover visit to Jerusalem. John next recounts Jesus' Last Supper with <b>his</b> <b>disciples.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{narrative}} of Jesus' post-Resurrection appearance to <b>his</b> <b>disciples</b> by the lake, the miraculous catch of fish, the prophecy of the crucifixion of Peter, {{the restoration of}} Peter, {{and the fate of}} the Beloved Disciple.

50|$|The lama {{was amazed}} at the {{achievement}} of attaining samadhi {{at such a young}} age. He then took Nabin to a famed lama named Paramananda Thakkar. Paramananda was a very great lama of Tibet and had reached the acme of Advaita Vedanta, tantra and Mahayana Buddhism. The Lama requested that Paramananda make Nabin <b>his</b> <b>disciple.</b> Paramananda agreed to give shelter to Nabin, but did not immediately make Nabin <b>his</b> <b>disciple.</b> Nabin had to first prove his worth. So Nabin selflessly served his new master for a few years. Finally Paramananda was pleased with Nabin’s service and made him <b>his</b> <b>disciple.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{original}} Sera Monastery is {{a complex}} of structures founded in 1419 by Jamchen Chojey Sakya Yeshe of Zel Gungtang (1355–1435), a disciple of Je Tsongkhapa.

5|$|According to Hindu legend Ramanuja (1017–1137), {{the leading}} expounder of Vishishtadvaita philosophy, visited the temple. One of <b>his</b> <b>disciples</b> placed Ramanuja's sandals {{along with the}} image of Varadarajar. Ramanujar became furious at this, for which the disciple {{explained}} that for Ramanuja Varadarajar is god, but for him, Ramanuja is supreme. Thiruvellarai is the birthplace of Uyyakondar, a disciple of Nathamuni. Swami Engalazhwan is believed to have taught Sri Bhasyam to Nadadhoor Ammal in the temple.|$|E
5|$|In John's gospel, Jesus and <b>his</b> <b>disciples</b> go to Judea {{early in}} Jesus' {{ministry}} before John the Baptist was imprisoned and executed by Herod. He leads a ministry of baptism larger than John's own. The Jesus Seminar rated this account as black, containing no historically accurate information.

5|$|In November 2007 someone {{claiming}} to be an al-Qaeda member sent Rambhadracharya a letter telling him and <b>his</b> <b>disciples</b> either to accept Islam or {{to be prepared to}} die. Police superintendent Kamal Singh Rathore said that this letter had been sent from Haridwar, that Rambhadracharya's security arrangements had been increased and that an intensive investigation of the letter had been carried out. Gita Devi, secretary of JRHU, said that Rambhadracharya had been threatened by al-Qaeda, as Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas president Nrityagopal had been in the past.|$|E
5|$|Vivekananda {{spent nearly}} two years lecturing in the eastern and central United States, {{primarily}} in Chicago, Detroit, Boston, and New York. He founded the Vedanta Society of New York in 1894. By spring 1895 his busy, tiring schedule had affected his health. He ended his lecture tours and began giving free, private classes in Vedanta and yoga. Beginning in June 1895, Vivekananda gave private lectures to a dozen of <b>his</b> <b>disciples</b> at Thousand Island Park in New York for two months.|$|E
5|$|Around AD 30, Jesus and his {{followers}} traveled from Galilee to Jerusalem to observe Passover. Jesus caused a disturbance in the Second Temple, which {{was the center of}} Jewish religious and civil authority. Sanders associates it with Jesus' prophecy that the Temple would be totally demolished. Jesus had a last meal with <b>his</b> <b>disciples,</b> which is the origin of the Christian sacrament of bread and wine. Jesus' words are recorded in the Synoptics and in Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians. The differences in the accounts cannot be completely reconciled, and {{it is impossible to know}} what Jesus intended, but in general the meal seems to point forward to the coming Kingdom. Jesus probably expected to be killed, and he may have hoped that God would intervene.|$|E

5|$|As {{the road}} {{condition}} required extremely good driving skills, the China Relief Fund decided to test drivers {{and established a}} driving institute on a vacant piece of accessible land behind the Siong Lim Temple. Venerable Pu Liang, the monastery's 10th abbot, supported the China Relief Fund. Qualified volunteers from Nanyang converged in Singapore to form a batch. In 1939, about 3,200volunteers left in nine batches that included not only Chinese men, but also Indians, Malays, and four Chinese women. About 1,000 of them died in service, 1,000 settled in China and others returned to Nanyang after the war. The Venerable and two of <b>his</b> <b>disciples</b> were later arrested and executed during the Sook Ching Massacre in 1942.|$|E
5|$|By 1969, Clarence13X {{became very}} tired and slept little. He feared {{that he would}} be killed and {{instructed}} his followers to remain strong if he died. On June12, he spent time with several of <b>his</b> <b>disciples</b> at their school. He left the school between 2:00 and 3:00 am on June 13 and then gambled for an hour or two. As was his occasional practice, he traveled to Dora Smith's house to rest. He was ambushed by three assailants who fatally shot him {{while he was in the}} lobby of her apartment building. That morning, several people from the mayor's office met with his family, and the mayor later visited the Five Percenters' school to express condolences.|$|E
