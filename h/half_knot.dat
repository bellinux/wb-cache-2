5|$|Prinzregent Luitpold was {{equipped}} with two sets of Parsons turbines on the outer shafts. It was intended that a single 12,000bhp Germania 6-cylinder 2-stroke diesel engine would drive the center shaft. However, the diesel power plant was not ready in time to be installed in Prinzregent Luitpold, so the ship sailed with only two shafts. On trials, Prinzregent Luitpold was approximately one <b>half</b> <b>knot</b> slower than her sisters.|$|E
25|$|Hemp jewelry is {{the product}} of {{knotting}} hemp twine through the practice of macramé. Hemp jewellery includes bracelets, necklaces, anklets, rings, watches and other adornments. Some jewellery features beads made from crystals, glass, stone, wood and bones. The hemp twine varies in thickness and comes in a variety of colors. There are many different stitches used to create hemp jewellery, however, the <b>half</b> <b>knot</b> and full knot stitches are most common.|$|E

500|$|The {{design process}} {{was marked by}} various efforts to meet the General Board's {{specifications}} with only a moderate increase in tonnage over the Nevada-class. Between January and March 1912, thirteen sketches were prepared for consideration by C with reciprocating or turbine engines that traded either speed or metacentric height for armor. Some later designs gave up a <b>half</b> <b>knot</b> of speed to free up about , enough to thicken the belt from [...] and the barbettes to 14 inches. The choice between double or triple turrets was also still an issue, as the Nevada-class had not been completed yet. The Bureau of Ordnance {{was in favor of}} waiting for test results, rather than risking reverting to two-gun 14-inch turrets or moving up to two-gun 16-inch turrets.|$|E
60|$|In half an hour, indeed, it fell {{so light}} that the Osprey was {{standing}} {{through the water}} only at three and a <b>half</b> <b>knots</b> an hour.

5|$|The reduced length while {{retaining}} the same beam as the prior Connecticut class {{resulted in a}} disadvantageous length-to-beam ratio, causing reduced performance relative to that class. Not only was their top speed a knot slower, but also their economical speed was reduced by one and <b>half</b> <b>knots.</b> They also had 25% less coal storage, further reducing their operating range.|$|R
60|$|A lookout {{had already}} been placed aloft. Several sails were seen in the distance, {{in the course of}} the afternoon, but nothing that excited suspicion.

In the evening the wind dropped still more and, by nine o'clock, the brig had scarcely steerage way.|$|R
500|$|In March 1912, C {{proposed}} their seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth {{designs to}} the General Board for approval. The eighth and ninth designs {{were the ones}} {{to give up a}} <b>half</b> <b>knot</b> of speed, while the tenth was a design with four triple turrets and [...] lighter than the Nevada-class ships. In April, the General Board chose the seventh design, which satisfied all of their requirements, albeit on the largest displacement, [...] The length was fixed at , the beam at , and the draft at [...] Steam turbines gave the design [...] and 21 knots, while the main armor belt was 13.5inches tapering to [...] at the ends. This design was further refined and emerged in a completed state in September. The delay was partially due to tests on the proposed armor, which were completed in June 1912 and resulted in significant alterations to the Pennsylvania-class' underwater protection.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} types of macramé knots. Macramé art also {{includes}} lacings and crossings created when two or more knot segments are joined together. The square knot is considered the simplest knot and the half hitch, {{also known as the}} <b>half</b> <b>knot,</b> is the second most basic knot. These knots are typically used when hemp making hemp jewelry. The <b>half</b> <b>knot</b> produces a spiral cord and the full square knot produces a flat cord. Beads and other decorations are also weaved into the jewelry. Hemp is ideal for this jewelry because it is durable and keeps its shape well.|$|E
50|$|Diagonal, or offset {{knotting}} has knots in successive rows occupy alternate {{pairs of}} warps. This feature allows for changes from one <b>half</b> <b>knot</b> to the next, and creates diagonal pattern lines at different angles. It is sometimes found in Kurdish or Turkmen rugs, particularly in Yomuds. It is mostly tied symmetrically.|$|E

50|$|<b>Half</b> <b>knots</b> {{are tied}} {{alternately}} behind {{and in front}} of the rope until the width of the band of twine approaches the diameter of the rope. A reef (square) knot, or better a series of reef (square) knots, completes the whipping. If a needle is available this string of reef (square) knots can be pulled through the rope to bury the ends. Alternatively, a short bight of another rope can be laid first and used to pull the rope ends through. If the rope is a stranded rope, the ends can usually be pulled through without a needle.|$|R
