25|$|Following the {{completion}} of the Spanish Reconquista in 1492, Christopher Columbus discovered the New World under the sponsorship of the Spanish crown. This opened up a new export market as well as new opportunity for wine production. Spanish missionaries and conquistadors brought <b>European</b> <b>grape</b> vines with them as they colonized the new lands. During this period Spanish exports to England began to wane as Spanish-English relations steadily deteriorated following the divorce of Henry VIII of England from his Spanish wife Catherine of Aragon. English merchants from the Sherry producing regions of Jerez and Sanlúcar de Barrameda as well as Málaga fled the area due to the fear of persecution by the Spanish Inquisition.|$|E
25|$|Chardonnay {{was one of}} {{the first}} <b>European</b> <b>grape</b> {{varieties}} to have been grown commercially east of the Rocky Mountains. After three centuries of failure with V. vinifera, this achievement was realized in the Finger Lakes region of upstate New York. Frenchman Charles Fournier and Russian Konstantin Frank experimented with Chardonnay and other varietals in hopes of producing sparkling wines based on Old World grapes for the Gold Seal wine company. In the late 1950s, they succeeded in harvesting the first commercial quantities of European grapes in eastern North America. Frank went on to found Konstantin Frank Vinifera Wine Cellars which helped demonstrate that a winery in the eastern US can produce European-style wines as a basis for a winery business. Chardonnay became an important part of that strategy.|$|E
2500|$|Furmint {{shares a}} wide range of {{synonyms}} with several other <b>European</b> <b>grape</b> varieties - such as Sauvignon vert which was once known under the synonym of Tocai Friulano even though the grape was probably never used in the production of Tokay. To confuse things further, not only does Furmint share several synonyms with Sauvignon vert but Sauvignon vert itself is a synonym for the [...] "green berry" [...] sub-variety of Furmint. This, coupled with physical similarities between several strains of white grapevines makes identification of different wines, particularly those in developing Eastern European countries difficult.|$|E
50|$|Phylloxerids can {{transmit}} diseases to plants. Their importance {{is even more}} perceptible historically. In fact, Daktulosphaira vitifoliae known as the grape phylloxera is considered as the most economically important insect pest of commercial grapevines Vitis worldwide. In the late 19th century, the phylloxera epidemic destroyed almost all the <b>European</b> <b>grapes</b> and they could only fix the problem by planting grapes from the US, then grafting <b>European</b> <b>grapes</b> onto American roots.|$|R

50|$|After the {{establishment}} of Spanish missions between 1595-1620, the Timucua were introduced to European foods, including barley, cabbage, chickens, cucumbers, figs, garbanzo beans, garlic, <b>European</b> <b>grapes,</b> <b>European</b> greens, hazelnuts, various herbs, lettuce, melons, oranges, peas, peaches, pigs, pomegranates, sugar cane, sweet potatoes, watermelons, and wheat. The native corn became a traded item and was exported to other Spanish colonies.|$|R
2500|$|Reaching Paris in {{the latter}} part of 1857, Haraszthy {{enrolled}} in the École Polytechnique, France's most prestigious engineering school. [...] Two years later, he went north to Épernay in Champagne, where he studied Champagne-making in the house of De Venoge. [...] He was in Paris in late 1861, when his father, mother, and sister Ida arrived there to begin a vine-gathering tour of Europe. Haraszthy traveled with his father through France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and Spain, helping him gather vines which were sent back to San Francisco. [...] After Agoston Haraszthy returned to San Francisco at the end of 1861, he had more than 100,000 vine cuttings representing more than 300 <b>European</b> <b>grape</b> varieties. [...] In New York, Harper & Brothers (now Harper) published his book about his European tour, called Grape Culture, Vines, and Wine-Making. [...] When Haraszthy’s Champagne studies were complete, he returned to California in the fall of 1862.|$|E
50|$|The {{most popular}} grapes grown in Colorado are {{varieties}} in the species of <b>European</b> <b>grape</b> Vitis vinifera. The most popular red varieties are Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, and Cabernet Franc. The most popular white varieties are Chardonnay, Riesling, and Viognier.|$|E
50|$|Nebraska's climate, {{with its}} long, hot summers, cold winters, and wide {{seasonal}} variations in precipitation and humidity limits {{the ability to}} grow <b>European</b> <b>grape</b> varieties.

5000|$|Most of {{the grapes}} grown in Michigan are grown for [...] "table" [...] uses (like jelly and grape juice), not wine. Of 100,000 short tons of grapes {{produced}} in 2005, only 4,600 tons {{were used for}} wine-making. However, the proportion of vinifera grapes used in wine-making is increasing. In 2005, the wine industry pressed 2,640 tons of <b>European</b> vinifera <b>grapes,</b> 1,660 tons of hybrid varieties, and 300 tons of American varieties. <b>European</b> <b>grapes</b> grown include Cabernet Franc, Chardonnay, Gewürztraminer, Pinot noir, Merlot, Syrah, Pinot gris, and Riesling.|$|R
50|$|During {{the summer}} of 1711, Graffenried, along with John Lawson, took a trip up the Neuse River. Graffenried wanted to crossbreed <b>European</b> <b>grapes</b> with wild, native grapes and start a vineyard. The Tuscarora took captive Graffenried, John Lawson, and an enslaved African whom they had {{entrusted}} with their baggage.|$|R
50|$|In 1850 he {{experimented with}} sulfur as a remedy against powdery mildew, a fungus {{that had a}} serious {{negative}} impact on <b>European</b> <b>grapes</b> during the mid-19th century.

5000|$|Uhudler {{originates}} {{from the}} time of the large phylloxera infestations around 1860. The phylloxera aphid reached Europe in 1860 and Austria in around 1900. After the losses of the <b>European</b> <b>grape</b> varieties through phylloxera, many attempts were made to either exterminate the pest or use alternative, non-traditional viticultural practices which would prevail against infestation.|$|E
5000|$|DNA {{fingerprinting}} at the University of California, Davis in {{the late}} 1990s identified Gouais blanc as the ancestor {{of a large number}} of classical <b>European</b> <b>grape</b> varieties. This came as something of a surprise, given the old division into Frankish and Hunnic grape varieties used in the Germanic world, as it meant that the prototype simple [...] "Hunnic" [...] grape was in fact an ancestor to most of the noble [...] "Frankish" [...] grapes.|$|E
50|$|The winery was {{established}} by Éthienne Thée in 1852, who named the vineyard after New Almaden, a nearby quicksilver mining town. Though sources contradict concerning details of the original foundation, it was undeniably Charles Le Franc, son-in-law of Thée, who planted the first choice <b>European</b> <b>grape</b> varieties {{at the foot of}} the Santa Cruz Mountains. The conditions of Pacific cool evening breeze and rocky soil are not sufficiently fertile for large yields but grapes of special quality.|$|E

In San Diego he is remembered as the first town marshal and the first county sheriff. In California he introduced more than three hundred varieties of <b>European</b> <b>grapes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Seibel grapes are a {{group of}} wine grape {{varieties}} which originated {{with the work of}} Albert Seibel crossing <b>European</b> <b>grape</b> with American grape species to increase disease resistance. They were planted widely in France during the 1950s but have seen decline in recent years because French wine law proscribes hybrid grapes in appellation wine. The grapes are still commonly used as blending grapes in table wine and mass commercial wines. New Zealand, England, and Canada also have plantings of Seibel grapes.|$|E
50|$|Inniskillin {{was founded}} by Donald Ziraldo and Karl Kaiser and saw its {{beginnings}} in 1974. Before embarking on the Innskillin project, Ziraldo was running a grapevine nursery and Karl Kaiser, a trained chemist, was a home wine maker. The first vines were planted in 1974, and since the duo had the ambition to make better-quality wines, their vineyard was planted with traditional <b>European</b> <b>grape</b> varieties, of the Vitis vinifera species, chosen from those cultivated in colder European regions. Their first vineyard, of 32 acre was planted with Riesling, Chardonnay and Gamay.|$|E
50|$|There {{is still}} no remedy, as such, for the Phylloxera, or the disease it brings with it, and it still poses a {{substantial}} threat to any vineyard not planted with grafted rootstock. In fact, {{there is only one}} <b>European</b> <b>grape</b> vine known to be resistant to the Phylloxera, the Assyrtiko vine, which grows on the volcanic Greek island of Santorini; however there is speculation that the actual source of this resistance may arise from the volcanic ash in which the vines grow, and not from the vine itself.|$|E
50|$|The state’s {{history of}} {{viticulture}} begins in 1648 with the earliest recorded instance of winemaking in Maryland. Fourteen years later, the first <b>European</b> <b>grapes</b> planted in Maryland were deposited in 200 acre {{on the east}} bank of St. Marys River. It {{was not until the}} 1930s that Philip Wagner, a columnist with the Baltimore Sun, published American Wines and How to Make Them. The book was later revised as Grapes Into Wine and became the definitive book on winemaking in America.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} method of {{propagating}} fruit trees, suitable {{for nearly all}} species, is grafting onto rootstocks. This in essence involves physically joining part of a shoot of a hybrid cultivar onto the roots of a different but closely related species or cultivar, so that the two parts grow together as one plant. The process of joining the two varieties must ensure maximum contact between the cambium (the layer just below the bark) of each, so that they grow together successfully. Grafting is a preferred method because it not only propagates a new plant of the desired hybrid cultivar, it usually also confers extra advantages {{as a result of}} the characteristics of the rootstocks (or stocks), which are selected for characteristics such as their vigour of growth, hardiness and soil tolerance, as well as compatibility with the desired variety that will form the aerial part of the plant (called the scion). For example, grape rootstocks descended from North American <b>grapes</b> allow <b>European</b> <b>grapes</b> to be grown in areas infested with Phylloxera, a soil-dwelling insect that attacks and kills <b>European</b> <b>grapes</b> when grown on their own roots. Two of the most common grafting techniques are [...] "whip and tongue", carried out in spring as the sap rises, and [...] "budding", which is performed around the end of summer.|$|R
50|$|Albert Seibel (1844-1936) was a French {{physician}} and viticulturist who made hybrid crosses of <b>European</b> wine <b>grapes</b> (Vitis vinifera) with native North American grapes. His crosses {{are known as}} Seibel grapes.|$|R

50|$|The exact {{origins of}} the Dimyat grape are unknown, with some ampelographers believing the vine to be native to the Bulgaria area. Recent DNA typing has shown {{it to be a}} {{crossing}} of Gouais Blanc (Weißer Heunisch) with another, unidentified grape variety. Gouais is a parent of several older <b>European</b> <b>grape</b> varieties. One alternative hypothesis, which is highly improbable given the Gouais parentage, is the legendary tale that the grape was native to the Nile Delta valley (where today there is an Egyptian town with a similar name, Damietta) and was brought back to Thrace by Christian Crusaders.|$|E

50|$|In the 18th {{century and}} much of the 19th century it was {{impossible}} to grow <b>European</b> wine <b>grapes</b> in the open air in the eastern half of North America. The Alexander combined disease and pest resistance from North American grapes with some of the better qualities of <b>European</b> wine <b>grapes.</b> It was an acceptable grape for large-scale planting and wine production. The Alexander was the basis for the first successful North American wine industry over much of the east coast, in Pennsylvania in the 1790s, in Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, and in Indiana in 1806.|$|R
50|$|Paraguayan wine history {{falls into}} three {{distinct}} chronological categories. In the mission period {{starting in the}} late 16th century, Spanish-speaking Jesuit missionaries planted <b>European</b> <b>grapes</b> (vitis vinifera) {{as part of the}} cultural goal of creating a self-sufficient Christian community. With independence in the early 19th century, Paraguayan winegrowing died out. The new country turned to other beverages, such as yerba mate and beer, and its demand for sacred wine was filled by imports. In 1908 Carlos Voigt, a winegrower of German heritage, began growing grapes in the province of Guiará. This marked the rebirth of the Paraguayan wine industry.|$|R
50|$|The only <b>European</b> <b>grapes</b> {{that are}} {{natively}} resistant to phylloxera are the Assyrtiko grape which grows on the volcanic island of Santorini, Greece, {{although it is}} not clear whether the resistance is due to the rootstock itself or the volcanic ash on which it grows; and the Juan Garcia grape variety, autochthonous to the medieval village of Fermoselle in Spain. The Juan Garcia variety remained—untouched by phylloxera—sheltered on the vineyards planted on the man-made land terraces along the mountainous skirts on the gigantic and steep Arribes River Canyon, where the microclimatic conditions discourage the growth of phylloxera.|$|R
50|$|Rainfall in the Puget Sound AVA {{ranges from}} 15 in to 60 in annually, {{which is similar}} to many <b>European</b> <b>grape</b> growing areas and the Willamette Valley AVA in Oregon. Most of that {{rainfall}} occurs in the winter time. Summers are mild, sunny and dry. Irrigation is a necessity in some of the drier locations. The AVA is suited to cool climate varieties such as Madeleine Angevine, Madeline Sylvaner, Muller-Thurgau and Siegerrebe with some clonal varieties of Pinot noir and Pinot gris and Chardonnay growing well in warmer locations. Many new varieties showed promise during tests at the Washington State University Mount Vernon Agricultural Research Station. Those include Regent, St. Laurent, Zweigelt, Dornfelder and Garanoir.|$|E
50|$|The term Criollas is {{also used}} collectively {{to refer to a}} group of presumably American-born cultivars the European grapevine Vitis vinifera, much {{in the same way as}} many other uses of the term Criollo. The Criollas group of grape {{varieties}} also include e.g. the three Argentine Torrontés varieties (Torrontés Mendocino, Torrontés Riojano, and Torrontés Sanjuanino) and Torontel (also known as Moscatel Amarillo). A common feature of the Criollas group is a better resistance to certain types of environmental stress, such as low water availability and high salt concentrations, than many traditional <b>European</b> <b>grape</b> varieties. Presumably, these varieties have been selected by pioneering viticulturists for these properties, which made them easier to grow in early South American vineyards.|$|E
50|$|While {{attending}} the legislature, Haraszthy began to buy real estate near Mission San Francisco de Asís (Mission Dolores) in San Francisco. His first purchase there {{was made on}} March 25, 1852. He tried to raise grapes in San Francisco but found the climate too foggy. He acquired a large tract of land near Crystal Springs on the San Francisco Peninsula (now part of San Mateo County) and planted it to vineyards, but eventually gave up the effort to make wine there, again finding the climate too foggy to ripen the grapes. In both San Francisco and Crystal Springs, Haraszthy continued to import {{a wide variety of}} <b>European</b> <b>grape</b> vines and experimented with their planting and cultivation.|$|E
