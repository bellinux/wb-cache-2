5|$|On 2 December 2013, {{after more}} than a year of {{testimony}} and over 12,000 pages of evidence, the presiding coroner <b>instructed</b> <b>the</b> jury to begin their deliberations, and requested they come back with a verdict in Smith's death and recommendations on means to prevent a recurrence of such an event.|$|E
5|$|Before his death, Henry <b>instructed</b> <b>the</b> coachman {{to gather}} his {{remaining}} body parts in a cloth tied with blue string, {{place it in}} a cart drawn by a stallion. When the stallion broke, he was {{to replace it with}} an ox, and when the ox stopped, he was to build a church. This is where Henrik’s remains were to be buried.|$|E

50|$|It is {{believed}} that the mesoderm defines the pattern. <b>The</b> epidermis <b>instructs</b> <b>the</b> mesodermal cells to condense and then <b>the</b> mesoderm <b>instructs</b> <b>the</b> epidermis of what structure to make {{through a series of}} reciprocal inductions. Transplantation experiments involving frog and newt epidermis indicated that the mesodermal signals are conserved between species but the epidermal response is species-specific meaning that <b>the</b> mesoderm <b>instructs</b> <b>the</b> epidermis of its position and the epidermis uses this information to make a specific structure.|$|R

In 2006 he was again quoted, when the Irish Court of Criminal Appeal used the same work in their review of the 1982 conviction of Brian Meehan for the murder of Veronica Guerin.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Senate Bill 711 was {{introduced}} by Florida Senator Robert M. Haverfield. It <b>instructed</b> <b>the</b> state Board of Education and the Board of Regents (BOR), to begin planning {{for the development of}} a state university in Miami. The bill was signed into law by then-governor W. Haydon Burns in June 1965, marking FIU's official founding.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} week of January 2014, a filing with the U.S. District court in San Jose showed that legal {{executives}} from both parties agreed to meet prior to February 19, 2014, to engage in settlement discussions. Both Samsung and Apple were responding to a court order that <b>instructed</b> <b>the</b> completion of such a meeting before a new trial begins in March 2014. One of three Samsung chiefs met with Cook, but the filing did not reveal the name of the representative.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the bombing of Banski dvori of 7 October, Croatian {{authorities}} <b>instructed</b> <b>the</b> ZNG to assault and capture JNA barracks in the Zagreb area if commanders considered it possible. The instructions did not result in attacks in Zagreb itself, but JNA barracks in Samobor were captured by Croatian forces {{on the day of the}} bombing. The declaration of the independence of Croatia came into force the next day.|$|E
5|$|Lamason then <b>instructed</b> <b>the</b> group not {{to trust}} the SS, or provoke {{them in any way}} because as they had {{experienced}} on the train, the guards were unpredictable and trigger-happy. Also, they were not to explore the camp because of the chance of breaking unknown rules, but to stay together and keep as far away from the guards as possible. He further stated that acting on the group's behalf, he would make further contact with the camp authorities for recognition of their rights.|$|E
5|$|On 14 September 1955, the Apostolic Vicariate of Dakar {{became an}} archdiocese, and Lefebvre thus {{became the first}} Metropolitan Archbishop of Dakar.

5|$|The Federal Council {{released}} a public statement on 11 July 1958 stating that although {{a world without}} nuclear weapons was in Switzerland's interest, its neighboring countries adopting nuclear weapons would force it to do likewise. On 23 December 1958 the Federal Council <b>instructed</b> <b>the</b> Military Department to study the logistics and execution of attaining nuclear arms. However, efforts remained focused on study and planning rather than implementation.|$|E
5|$|The inquest was {{frequently}} interrupted by multiple legal challenges {{and a change}} of coroner, before finally being terminated as a mistrial on 30 September 2011; a new inquest into Smith's death began on 19 September 2012.

5|$|While RCT-31 {{was under}} siege, Almond finally <b>instructed</b> <b>the</b> 1st Marine Division to rescue RCT-31 by {{breaking}} out of Yudam-ni—an impossible order for Smith to implement. Only the 31st Tank Company tried to rescue RCT-31 by attacking Hill 1221, but without infantry support, the two armored attacks on 28 and 29 November were stalled by slippery roads, rough terrain, and close infantry assaults. By 30 November the US forces evacuated Hudong-ni in order to defend Hagaru-ri, leaving the rest of RCT-31 completely stranded.|$|E
5|$|A {{hurricane}} warning was issued for the coastal locations north of Belize City with the forecast of 150mph (240km/h) winds. The government instituted a dusk-to-dawn curfew from Belize City to the Mexican border. On August 16and17, Prime Minister Said Musa chaired two meetings of Belize's National Emergency Management Organization (NEMO). He <b>instructed</b> <b>the</b> newly created Coastguard to evacuate popular tourist sites Caye Caulker and Ambergris Caye by boat and plane. Authorities also evacuated Belize City's three hospitals, moving high-risk patients inland {{to the capital}} Belmopan. The mayor urged residents to leave Belize City and {{to make use of}} shelters in the capital.|$|E
5|$|Another {{change in}} the 1370s was the {{formalisation}} {{of the process of}} guarding and maintaining the walls. During the invasion scare of 1377, Edward <b>instructed</b> <b>the</b> mayor to review these processes; it appears that the four wards of the town were surveyed, and each property was assigned a piece of the wall to maintain, varying according {{to the size of the}} property. For these purposes, the walls were measured out in units called loupes, or embrasures. The four wards were also responsible for the security and policing of the town.|$|E

5|$|British colonial {{secretary}} Lord Hillsborough, {{hoping to}} prevent {{a repeat of the}} Stamp Act Congress, <b>instructed</b> <b>the</b> colonial governors in America to dissolve the assemblies if they responded to the Massachusetts Circular Letter. He also directed Massachusetts Governor Francis Bernard to have the Massachusetts House rescind the letter. On June 30, the House refused to rescind the letter by a vote of 92 to 17, with Adams citing their right to petition as justification. Far from complying with the governor's order, Adams instead presented a new petition to the king asking that Governor Bernard be removed from office. Bernard responded by dissolving the legislature.|$|E
5|$|Desiring {{to return}} to the U.S. but still fearing capture, Breckinridge moved his family back to Niagara in June 1868. Within sight of the U.S. border, he steadfastly refused to seek a pardon, {{although}} 70 members of the Kentucky General Assembly had requested one on his behalf from President Andrew Johnson on February 10, 1866. On January 8, 1868, the Louisville City Council <b>instructed</b> <b>the</b> state's congressional delegation to seek assurance that Breckinridge would not be prosecuted on his return. James Beck, Breckinridge's old law partner, was then in Congress and wrote to him on December 11, 1868, that it appeared likely that Johnson would issue a general pardon for all former Confederates; he advised Breckinridge {{to return to}} the U.S. prior to the pardon being issued because he feared it might only apply to those in the country.|$|E
5|$|During the Great Depression this fee {{was lowered}} to $100 and {{eventually}} $75. All royalties {{went to the}} Syndicate, and all correspondence with the publisher was handled through a Syndicate office. The Syndicate was able to enlist the cooperation of libraries in hiding the ghostwriters' names; when Walter Karig, who wrote volumes eight through ten of the original Nancy Drew Mystery Stories, tried to claim rights with the Library of Congress in 1933, the Syndicate <b>instructed</b> <b>the</b> Library of Congress not to reveal the names of any Nancy Drew authors, a move with which the Library of Congress complied.|$|E
