The article presents the most important characteristics of sand-lime products, both traditional as well as modified with polyethylene glycol. The purpose of described research was to estimate porosity (determine the type, size and pores distribution) and to analyze the microstructure of aforementioned samples. From the practical point of view, these characteristics are particularly important in the construction materials. The following tests have been carried out: bulk density using the hydrostatic method, capillarity, water absorption and mercury porosimetry of samples containing polyethylene glycol. The samples were also subjected to observation of the microstructure under the scanning electron microscope. Preliminary research findings clearly show the positive influence of the used substrate on the basic properties of modified sand-lime product. In comparison to the reference sample, modified products showed a decrease in water absorption and reduced capillarity. The confrontation of the measurements made using a mercury porosimeter with observation of the microstructure, showed differences in the distribution of pores and their size. Besides the additive, the production process itself has a huge impact on the properties of silicates (mixing process, time and temperature of autoclaving) ...|$|E

The myth of Deianeira, though often neglected <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>greater</b> <b>interest</b> in her more transgressive tragic peers, provides fascinating insight into the conflict surrounding the appropriate wife and the ideal marriage. The two most illustrious treatments of her myth are the Trachiniae, written by Sophocles and the Heroides 9, written by Ovid. Sophocles focuses on Deianeira’s struggle to remain a proper wife after Heracles has brought home the foreign mistress Iole. This choice may have influenced by the Periclean funeral speech that advocated silence as women’s glory and the citizenship laws that prevented children from non-citizen wives to inherit. Ovid {{on the other hand}} used Deianeira as a mouthpiece to denounce Hercules’s willful submission to his foreign mistresses and shameful crossdressing. His criticism comes alongside Roman anxieties about effeminacy and the Julian laws that penalized the childless and rewarded citizens with large families. This thesis will track the ways in which contemporary culture changed the way the myth of Deianeira was written...|$|R

40|$|Object {{tracking}} in networked {{systems is}} a widely used scenario to assess newly designed methods {{in the field of}} association and estimation. This is mainly <b>due</b> <b>to</b> a <b>great</b> <b>interest</b> in object tracking applications.

In contrast this paper describes a modular software-architecture suitable for all object tracking methods in self-organizing, networked systems. This modular architecture not only enables a designer the freedom of choice for the different tracking methodologies but it also provides the ability to re-upload parts of the algorithm or even adapt the on-line algorithm to the situation at hand.

Further, the ν_μ - ν_τ oscillation is unlikely to solve the atmospheric neutrino problem and, if we fix the neutrino mass scale by the MSW solution, the neutrino masses are found to be too small to close the Universe.

We use a timed process algebra called BTC (for Bounded True Concurrency) that we have developed from CSP and which takes into account that the available resources in a system have to be shared by all the processes. It is able to consider heterogeneous resources of any type (preemptable and non-preemptable) which makes it suitable for specifying FMS. We show {{by means of an}} ex-ample that the specifications obtained suit the real systems quite well, are straightforward and deadlock-free. <b>Due</b> <b>to</b> the <b>great</b> <b>interest</b> (and need) in obtaining shorter manufacturing lead times, we also carry out a performance evaluation using an algorithm which allows us to estimate the time required to evolve between states. To the best of our knowl-edge, this is the first attempt to do this with process algebras, and we think that it {{is a good way to}} be able to split up the system into subsys-tems, which will be easily analyzed without the deadlock problems that researchers in Petri Nets have encountered. ...|$|R
