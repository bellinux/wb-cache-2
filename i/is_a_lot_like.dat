500|$|Thalia Grace: Thalia is a 15-year-old demigod {{daughter}} of Zeus. Though she appears in Percy's dream {{in the first}} book, she makes a full appearance {{at the end of}} The Sea of Monsters and is given a greater role in the third book. Thalia is described as looking very punk, with electric blue eyes, black clothes, and spiky hair. Her personality is often described as [...] "independent and many times sarcastic." [...] Thalia <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> Percy and consequently, they often argue. She is heartbroken by Luke's betrayal, it is supposed that she had feelings for him.

In India, staging candle-lit marches, going to discothèques... I can see many beautiful women among them– highly dented-painted... I have grave doubts whether they're students..." [...] The remark was widely condemned as sexist. His sister Sharmistha said that she and their father the president both disapproved. Then Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan also expressed disapproval. Abhijit quickly withdrew his comment and apologised. [...] Spiritual guru Asaram Bapu also provoked extensive criticism from the public by saying that the victim was also to blame for her own assault because she could have stopped the attack if she had [...] "chanted God's name and fallen {{at the feet of the}} attackers".|$|E
500|$|Although gruesome for {{the most}} part, some segments, such as [...] "Citizen Kang" [...] in [...] "Treehouse of Horror VII", satirize {{political}} issues. The opening segment of [...] "Treehouse of Horror XIX" [...] featured Homer attempting to vote for Barack Obama but a rigged electronic voting machine instead registers a vote for John McCain. Rather than taking sides in the election, Al Jean says it is [...] "mostly a comment on what many people to {{believe to be the}} irregularities in our voting system." [...] In [...] "Treehouse of Horror XVII", a segment called [...] "The Day the Earth Looked Stupid" [...] ends with Kang and Kodos taking over Springfield as part of a mission called [...] "Operation: Enduring occupation". The script originally called for Kodos and Kang to look over the smoking ruins of Springfield and say [...] "This sure <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> Iraq will be."

500|$|Roxana Hadadi, {{reviewing}} Keeping Up {{with the}} Kardashians for The Washington Post, was extremely negative towards the reality series {{due to its}} absurdity, and commented that the show: [...] "firmly captures all of Kim and Co.'s dumbest instances from the series' debut [...] from the simply self-absorbed to the downright despicable." [...] Amaya Rivera, writing about the series for Popmatters, noted: [...] "Indeed, there is something disturbing about the Kardashians' intense hunger for fame. But even worseit is downright boring to watch this family live out their tedious lives." [...] John Kubicek, the senior writer of BuddyTV, reviewed the premiere of the third season of the show and discussed {{the reason for the}} family's success by saying that: [...] "the Kardashians' fame <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> Möbius strip or an M.

[...] Harriet Ryan and Adam Tschorn of the Los Angeles Times described Keeping Up with the Kardashians as a: [...] "Hollywood version of The Brady Bunch -- the harmless high jinks of a loving blended family against a backdrop of wealth and famous connections". Jessica Chasmar of The Washington Times said that series: [...] "illustrates our nation's moral, spiritual and cultural decay." [...] Chasmar emphasized its negative influence and noted: [...] "America of 50 years ago would regard Ms. Kardashian with a mixture of disdain and pity, embarrassed by the very idea of a young lady's most private moments being broadcast for all the world to see." ...|$|E
500|$|Seven CBS Sports analysts {{predicted}} a Bears victory, with Pete Prisco {{being the only}} one to favor the Browns. Jeff Joniak stated that the Bears had to attack the Browns' 3–4 defense, who ranked third in yards per pass attempt allowed at 5.32, with their fifth-ranked passing offense. Chicago's wide receiver duo of Marshall and Alshon Jeffery should also be utilized, as Joe Haden and Buster Skrine are at a size mismatch (Marshall is 5 inches and 40 pounds larger than Haden, while Jeffery is 6 inches and 30 pounds heavier than Skrine). Browns offensive coordinator Ray Horton commented, [...] "This team, Chicago, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> Detroit in that they have weapons at every position. Brandon Marshall and Alshon Jeffery have the most catches in the league. They have the most combined yards in the league. They are both, in our mind, No. 1 receivers. They present a challenge that you can’t double everybody. You can’t roll up to one guy because the other guy’s open." [...] On defense, the Bears had to contain Josh Gordon and Jordan Cameron. Gordon ranks second in yards after catch, while leading all receivers with 71 for an average of 19.7 yards. Cameron leads all tight ends with 23 third down catches. The Bears' worst-ranked run defense also has to defend against the Browns, which had the third-fewest rushing attempts in the league with 290 with an average of 3.78 yards, {{which is one of the}} bottom six in the league.|$|E

2500|$|With a new line-up in 1991 {{and a new}} {{recording}} label, Miller retired {{the name}} Game Theory and chose to call his new group The Loud Family. Rolling Stone described this name as both [...] "a hip allusion to the mid-Seventies PBS series An American Family" [...] and [...] "a clever way to describe the sound and feel of the band. Either way, it's a great hook—smart, funny and instantly memorable. All of which, appropriately enough, are qualities shared by Miller's songs." [...] Miller later described his intended reality-show metaphor: [...] "Going through life <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> having cameras on you {{and you have to}} perform, but there's no script; you just have to do the normal kind of bumbling thing. Besides, it had the word 'loud' in it." ...|$|E

In the card, Lucas says he and Peyton miss Jamie every day. In the later half of the season, Jamie asks Nathan about his relationship with Lucas. Nathan tells him that although they were not close when they were younger they became more like real brothers as they got older.

2500|$|While record-breaking {{years can}} attract {{considerable}} public interest, individual years are less significant than the overall trend. Some climatologists {{have criticized the}} attention that the popular press gives to [...] "warmest year" [...] statistics; for example, Gavin Schmidt stated [...] "the long-term trends or the expected sequence of records are {{far more important than}} whether any single year is a record or not." [...] Of the 2015 and 2016 records, Schmidt stated that the 2014–16 El Niño event was [...] "a factor ... but both 2015 and 2016 would have been records even without it"; he attributed about 90% of the warming in 2016 to anthropogenic climate change. [...] Consistent with Schmidt's comment, the NASA / NOAA announcement stated that [...] "lobally-averaged temperatures in 2016 were 1.78 degrees Fahrenheit (0.99 degrees Celsius) warmer than the mid-20th century mean" [...] and that the impact of El Niño warming was estimated to have [...] "increased the annual global temperature anomaly for 2016 by 0.2 degrees Fahrenheit (0.12 degrees Celsius)." [...] Comments from climate scientists reported in The Washington Post showed strong agreement in attributing the warming primarily to anthropogenic climate change, with some contribution from El Niño warming, though there were differing views on the significance of individual records. [...] Deke Arndt leads the monitoring group at NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information and offered an analogy in a report on NPR: [...] "The long-term warming <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>like</b> riding up an escalator over time. The longer you're on the escalator, the higher you go. And the El Niño phenomenon is like jumping up and down while you're on the escalator." [...] Arndt also stated that the [...] "long-term warming is driven almost entirely by greenhouse gases." [...] Peter Stott, acting director of the Met Office, noted the influence of the El Niño event on 2016 temperatures but also stated that [...] "the main contributor to warming over the last 150 years is human influence on climate from increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere." [...] Tim Osborn, Director of Research at the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit, agreed stating that [...] "ultiple lines of independent evidence confirm that the planet has warmed over the last 150 years: warmer oceans, warmer land, warmer lower atmosphere and melting ice. This long-term trend is the main cause for the record warmth of 2015 and 2016, surpassing all previous years – even ones with strong El Niño events." ...|$|E
