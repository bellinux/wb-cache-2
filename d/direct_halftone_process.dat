40|$|In this article, {{the authors}} propose {{a method for}} hiding a visual {{watermark}} in color printed images with arbitrary, natural content. The embedded watermark is imperceptible under normal illumination, but it is revealed under UV illumination. Their method is using the white-paper fluorescence {{as a source of}} the watermark signal. The binary visual watermark is embedded by controlling the amount of fluorescence during the <b>halftoning</b> <b>process,</b> which is achieved by modulating the fractional white area of exposed paper substrate. The method is based on the iterative Color <b>Direct</b> Binary Search <b>halftoning,</b> which ensures high quality of the printed images, and uses a suitable error metric to control the perceived distortion due to the watermark embedding. Results show that the proposed method achieves low perceptibility of the embedded watermark under normal illumination, while the watermark is easily detectable using a portable UV flashlight even in bright daylight conditions...|$|R

40|$|Digital image {{watermarking}} is {{the process}} of encoding information into a digital image without deteriorating the visual quality of the image. Digital watermarking techniques are designed to withstand various attacks such as standard image processing operations, compression and geometric transformations. In this report we focus on watermarking of printed images and argue that this application requires specialized methods. Previous work relating to hardcopy watermarking applied standard digital watermarking schemes or suggested techniques that exploit the specific printing (i. e. <b>halftoning)</b> <b>process.</b> This work proposes a novel transform domain hardcopy watermarking technique that is independent of the <b>halftoning</b> <b>process</b> and is rather based on a noise model for the printing and scanning operations. The proposed scheme allows for blind watermark decoding, i. e. the encoder does not know the original image. It is image adaptable, to enhance the visual quality, and is tuneable on the trade-off between information embedding, rate, and visual quality...|$|R

There was not one <b>halftone</b> <b>process,</b> but a considerable number of them, the earliest dating nearly {{as far back as the}} introduction of practical photography in 1839. They varied widely in their degree of practicality and the quality of their results. The first attempts involved directly etching the unique images formed on metallic Daguerreotype plates. Although pleasing results were obtained, etching the plates required great skill and care, the images could not be printed along with ordinary type, and the delicate plates wore out after a very small number of impressions, making such processes useless for publishing on a commercial scale. More practical processes started appearing in the 1860s, but high cost, special printing requirements or low image quality variously kept these early processes from coming into widespread use.|$|R

40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} proposes a novel {{algorithm}} for enhancing the quality of 2 ̆ 2 flat 2 ̆ 2 regions in printed color image documents. The algorithm is designed to identify the 2 ̆ 2 flat 2 ̆ 2 regions based on certain criteria and filter these regions to minimize the noise prior and post Halftoning {{so as to make}} the hard copy look visibly pleasing. Noise prior to <b>halftone</b> <b>process</b> is removed using a spatial Gaussian filter together with a Hamming window, concluded from results after implementing various filtering techniques. A clustered dithering is applied in each channel of the image as <b>Halftoning</b> <b>process.</b> Furthermore, to minimize the post halftone noise, the halftone structure of the image is manipulated according to the neighboring sub-cells in their respective channels. This is done to reduce the brightness variation (a cause for noise) between the neighboring subcells. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm efficiently minimizes noise in 2 ̆ 2 flat 2 ̆ 2 regions of mirumal gradient change in color images...|$|R

50|$|Where {{continuous}} tone imagery contains an infinite {{range of colors}} or greys, the <b>halftone</b> <b>process</b> reduces visual reproductions to an image that is printed with only one color of ink, in dots of differing size (amplitude modulation) or spacing (frequency modulation). This reproduction relies on a basic optical illusion: the tiny halftone dots are blended into smooth tones by the human eye. At a microscopic level, developed black-and-white photographic film also consists of only two colors, and not an infinite range of {{continuous tone}}s. For details, see film grain.|$|R
50|$|Stochastic {{screening}} or FM screening is a <b>halftone</b> <b>process</b> {{based on}} pseudo-random distribution of halftone dots, using frequency modulation (FM) {{to change the}} density of dots according to the gray level desired.

The stochastic screening or FM screening instead uses a fixed size of dots (for example, about 25 micrometres) and a distribution density that varies depending on the color’s tone.|$|R
40|$|Error-diffusion and its {{variants}} {{are commonly}} used halftoning techniques that produce dispersed dot (FM) halftones, which are often preferred because they are free from low-frequency structure. Since the isolated dots resulting from error diffusion are reproduced well on inkjet printers, error diffusion is commonly employed in these devices. Inkjet printers often print a page in two passes {{in order to allow}} for better drying of inks and to minimize appearance of a head signature. Any potential misregistration between the passes is typically not comprehended in the error-diffusion <b>halftoning</b> <b>process.</b> The mis-registration between the passes can therefore cause significantly increased graininess (low-frequency structure) in printed error diffusion images even though the electronic bitmaps generated by error diffusion are free from low-frequency structure. In this paper, we propose modifications to the error-diffusion <b>halftoning</b> <b>process</b> that take the two pass printing into account and produce halftones that are robust to inter-pass mis-registration errors. This allows reduced tolerances and alignment requirements in manufacturing that translate to lower cost. The proposed technique works by suitably biasing the error diffusion process to ensure {{that a majority of the}} minority pixels are concentrated in a single pass, which provides improved robustness to mis-registration between the passes. Experimental results demonstrate that the modified error-diffusion technique performs significantly better than regular error diffusion in the presence of mis-registration errors...|$|R

30|$|To detect if {{a picture}} region is lost or tampered, the {{extracted}} watermark is {{compared with the}} corresponding “host” content. For tampering detection, we extract the watermark and compute its inverse halftoning version. By computing the structural similarity (SSIM) between blocks of inverse halftoning and host content, {{it is expected that}} SSIM is higher for blocks where there are no tampers. On the other hand, if the image is tampered, the structural similarity between host and restored blocks are lower. For error concealment, the position of the lost areas are identified by the decoder and the damaged areas are substituted by the recovered watermark after an inverse <b>halftoning</b> <b>process.</b>|$|R
30|$|The halftoning and inverse <b>halftoning</b> <b>processes</b> can be {{regarded}} as the encoding and decoding processes of vector quantization. Therefore, the codebook design methods can be applied to build the inverse halftoning lookup tables [6, 7]. The content of a table entry is the centroid of the input samples that are mapped to this entry. The results are optimal in the sense of minimizing the MSE for a given halftone method. Although the table lookup method has the advantages of good reconstructed quality and fast speed, it faces the empty cell problem in which no or very few training samples are mapped to a specific halftone pattern.|$|R
