In a Massachusetts No-Fault claim the insurance companies may require a report to be dictated by the doctor within 24 hours of the <b>IME</b> and sent <b>to</b> all parties of interest. In New York State, the Worker's Compensation Board allows the doctor 10 business days from the date of the <b>IME</b> <b>to</b> dictate the report and have it sent to all parties.

In use for over 150 years, POJ was used to publish a Holo Bible and many other important texts. In addition, the transcription of Holo shares similarities with Japanese: the written language can be represented in various ways (in syllabic forms or in ideographic forms). Holo can be written in either Romanized form (Pe̍h-ōe-jī) or in Chinese/Han characters. A standard IME for Japanese exists, in which text is entered phonetically, and then converted by the <b>IME</b> <b>to</b> be presented in various final forms: hiragana, katakana, kanji, or romaji. Conceivably, an analogous system could be developed for Holo using the same principles.|$|R

40|$|Background: International medical electives (IMEs) {{are unique}} {{learning}} opportunities; however, trainees can risk patient safety. Returning medical students often express concern about doing procedures beyond {{their level of}} training. The Canadian Federation of Medical Students has developed guidelines for pre-departure training (PDT), which do not address procedural skills. The purpose {{of this research is}} to determine which procedural skills to include in future PDT. Methods: Twenty-six medical students who returned from <b>IMEs</b> completed surveys <b>to</b> assess PDT. Using a Likert scale, we compared procedures performed by students before departing on <b>IME</b> <b>to</b> those performed while abroad. We used a similar scale to assess which procedures students feel ought to be included in future PDT. Results: There was no significant increase in number of procedures performed while on IME.   Skills deemed most important to include in future PDT were intravenous line insertion, suturing of lacerations, surgical assisting and post-operative wound care. Conclusions: Pre-departure training is new and lacks instruction in procedural skills. Over half the students rated several procedural skills such as IV line insertion, suturing, assisting in surgery, post operative wound management and foley catheterization as important assets for future PDT...|$|R

30|$|Under such circumstances, the {{estimation}} of BCFs also for highly hydrophobic organic chemicals (HOCs) in flow-through fish tests might remain essential in the future. A column elution method was developed by Fraunhofer <b>IME</b> <b>to</b> generate stable concentrations of HOCs for aquatic bioconcentration studies which can be maintained throughout an extended uptake period of up to 60  days. Bioconcentration studies with test items characterized by high [hexachlorobenze (HCB), o-terphenyl] and very high [PCB 153, dibenzo(a,h)anthracene] lipophilicity were carried out. The results of the BCF studies on rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) presented by Christian Schlechtriem, Fraunhofer IME, Schmallenberg, show that aqueous exposure bioaccumulation fish tests according to OECD TG 305 {{can be carried out}} with HOCs.
