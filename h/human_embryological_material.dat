50|$|The {{development}} of the secondary palate commences in the sixth week of <b>human</b> <b>embryological</b> development. It is characterised by the formation of two palatal shelves on the maxillary prominences, the elevation of these shelves to a horizontal position, and then a process of palatal fusion between the horizontal shelves. The shelves will also fuse anteriorly upon the primary palate, with the incisive foramen being the landmark between the primary palate and secondary palate. This forms {{what is known as}} the roof of the mouth, or the hard palate.|$|R
40|$|With rapid {{advances}} in medical imaging, fetal diagnosisof human {{congenital heart disease}} is now technically feasible in the first trimester. Although the first <b>human</b> <b>embryological</b> studies were recorded by Hippocrates in 300 to 400 BC, present-day knowledge of normal human cardiac development in the first trimester is still limited. In 1886, 2 articles by Dr His described {{the development of the}} heart on the basis of dissections of young human embryos. Free-hand wax models were made that illustrated the external develop-mental anatomy. These wax plate reconstruction methods were used by many other investigators until the early 1900 s. 1 Subsequently, serial histological sections of human embryos have been used to further investigate human cardiac devel-opment. 2 – 6 Using an analysis of histological sections and scaled reproductions of human embryos, Grant 2 showed a large cushion in the developing heart at 66 ⁄ 7 weeks (Carnegi...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{consists}} of three parts. Part 1 : Definition of Syndromes. Focus is given to craniofacial syndromes in which abnormal traits in the dentition are associated symptoms. In the last decade, research has concentrated on phenotype, genotype, growth, development, function, and treatment. Part 2 : Syndromes before Birth. How can the initial malformation sites in these syndromes be studied and what can we learn from it? In this section, deviations observed in syndromes prenatally will be highlighted and compared to the normal <b>human</b> <b>embryological</b> craniofacial development. Specific focus {{will be given to}} developmental fields studied on animal tissue and transferred to human cranial development. Part 3 : Developmental Fields Affected in Two Craniofacial Syndromes. Analysis of primary and permanent dentitions can determine whether a syndrome affects a single craniofacial field or several fields. This distinction is essential for insight into craniofacial syndromes. The dentition, thus, becomes central in diagnostics and evaluation of the pathogenesis. Developmental fields can explore and advance the concept of dental approaches to craniofacial syndromes. Discussion. As deviations in teeth persist and do not reorganize during growth and development, the dentition is considered useful for distinguishing between syndrome pathogenesis manifested in a single developmental field and in several fields...|$|R
40|$|The bone {{material}} interface {{has been}} an area of intense study over many decades, where studies of the healing process ranging from simple mineral deposition in vitro to actual healing in vivo have given important clues {{to the importance of}} calcium minerals in the bone/implant interface. Here, the authors use a combination of in vitro cell culture methods and in vivo implantation to study how the role of the spontaneously formed hydroxyapatite layer on Ti-implants for the in vivo-healing into the bone tissue of rat tibia. Initial experiments were made in reduced systems by incubation of TiO 2 in cell culture medium and analysis by time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy followed by subsequent exposure of <b>human</b> <b>embryological</b> stem cells analyzed by von Kossa staining and environmental scanning electron microsopy. In vivo studies of the bone-material interface was analyzed by ToF-SIMS depth profiling using both C- 60 (+) ions as well as a gas cluster ion source beam, Ar- 1500 (+) as sputter source. The low ion yield of the Ar- 1500 (+) for inorganics allowed the inorganic/organic interface of the implant to be studied avoiding the erosion of the inorganic materials caused by the conventional C- 60 (+) beam...|$|R
40|$|Being {{descendants}} of small terrestrial ungulate mammals, whales underwent enormous transformations during their evolutionary history, that is, extensive changes in anatomy, physiology, and behavior were evolved during secondary adaptations {{to life in}} water. However, still only {{little is known about}} whale ontogenetic development, which help to identify the timing and sequence of critical evolutionary events, such as modification of the cetacean ear. This is particularly true for baleen whales Mysticeti, the group including the humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae. We use high resolution X ray computed tomography to reinvestigate humpback whale fetuses from the Kükenthal collection at the Museum für Naturkunde, Berlin, thus, extending historic descriptions of their skeletogenesis and providing for the first time sequences of cranial ossification for this species. Principally, the ossification sequence of prenatal Megaptera follows a typical mammalian pattern with the anterior dermal bones being the first ossifying elements in the skull, starting with the dentary. In contrast to other mammals, the ectotympanic bone ossifies at an early stage. Alveolar structure can be observed in both the maxillae and dentaries in these early prenatal specimens but evidence for teeth is lacking. Although the possibility of obtaining new <b>embryological</b> <b>material</b> is unlikely due to conservation issues, our study shows that reexamination of existing specimens employing new technologies still holds promise for filling gaps in our knowledge of whale evolution and ontogen...|$|R
40|$|The {{attachment}} of the Achilles tendon {{is part of}} an ‘enthesis organ’ {{that reduces}} stress concentration at the hard–soft tissue interface. The organ also includes opposing sesamoid and periosteal fibrocartilages, a bursa and Kager's fat pad. In addition, the deep crural and plantar fasciae contribute to Achilles stress dissipation and could also be regarded as components. Here we describe the sequence in which these various tissues differentiate. Serial sections of feet from spontaneously aborted foetuses (crown rump lengths 22 – 322 mm) were examined. All slides formed part of an existing collection of histologically sectioned <b>embryological</b> <b>material,</b> obtained under Spanish law and housed in the Universidad Complutense, Madrid. From the earliest stages, it was evident that the Achilles tendon and plantar fascia had a mutual attachment to the calcaneal perichondrium. The first components of the enthesis organ to appear (in the 45 -mm foetus) were the retrocalcaneal bursa and the crural fascia. The former developed by cavitation within the mesenchyme that later gave rise to Kager's fat pad. The tip of the putative fat pad protruded into the developing bursa in the 110 -mm foetus and fully differentiated adipocytes were apparent in the 17 -mm foetus. All three fibrocartilages were first recognisable in the 332 -mm foetus – at which time adipogenesis had commenced in the heel fat pad. The sequence in which the various elements became apparent suggests that bursal formation and the appearance of the crural fascia may be necessary to facilitate the foot movements that subsequently lead to fibrocartilage differentiation. The later commencement of adipogenesis in the heel than in Kager's pad probably reflects the non-weight environment in utero. The direct continuity between plantar fascia and Achilles tendon that is characteristic of the adult reflects the initial attachment of both structures to the calcaneal perichondrium rather than to the skeletal anlagen itself...|$|R
40|$|Background: Advances {{in medical}} {{technology}} throughout {{the twentieth century}} have resulted in younger and smaller premature babies being kept alive. Improvements {{can be seen in}} survival rates of babies as young as 26 weeks; however this same improvement cannot be seen in babies of 24 weeks or younger, suggesting that the limit of viability has been reached. Aim: As babies of a younger gestational age are being admitted to neonatal units for intensive care, should we be asking if the limit of viability has been pushed too far? This study aims to investigate whether intensive care for these extremely premature infants can be defended. Method: This dissertation uses a critical review methodology. Summary of findings: Ethical dilemmas face healthcare professionals and parents everyday within the neonatal intensive care unit. In order to provide care that is {{in the best interests of}} the patient all options should be carefully considered. <b>Human</b> <b>embryological</b> development shows us that prematurity affects many of the vital body systems, as the majority of maturation occurs in the third trimester of pregnancy. Findings of the EPICure studies, observational cohort studies, show that although survival rates for extremely premature infants have improved, the same cannot be said for the rates of disability and other impairments in later life. It is essential that all statistics and information is laid out and presented to parents in a way that is easily understandable so informed decisions can be made for these tiny babies. Conclusion: Intensive treatment for premature infants below 24 weeks of gestation cannot be defended. For those 24 weeks of gestational age or over intensive treatment may not always be appropriate; instead comfort care should be considered a viable option...|$|R

Results: An unusually short segment of brachial artery in the right arm which bifurcated 21. 5 cm above the neck of radius at the level of insertion of coracobrachialis which bifurcated into radial and ulnar arteries of same calibre with high origin of radial artery. no other variation was found in relation to the cords of brachial plexus and their branches. dissection of left upper limb revealed no unusual observation. Conclusion: This could pose a challenging problem to vascular surgeons while performing reconstructive procedures. Itcan be evaluated by vascular mapping prior to an arteriovenous access creation. Altered hemodynamic environment may give rise to variant patterning of blood vessels. Keywords:Arteries-upper limb-arm-variations-embryology-clinical...|$|R

40|$|Although {{the camera}} {{eye of the}} octopus {{is very similar to}} that of <b>humans,</b> phylogenetic and <b>embryological</b> {{analyses}} have suggested that their camera eyes have been acquired independently. It has been known as a typical example of convergent evolution. To study the molecular basis of convergent evolution of camera eyes, we conducted a comparative analysis of gene expression in octopus and human camera eyes. We sequenced 16, 432 ESTs of the octopus eye, leading to 1052 nonredundant genes that have matches in the protein database. Comparing these 1052 genes with 13, 303 already-known ESTs of the human eye, 729 (69. 3 %) genes were commonly expressed between the human and octopus eyes. On the contrary, when we compared octopus eye ESTs with human connective tissue ESTs, the expression similarity was quite low. To trace the evolutionary changes that are potentially responsible for camera eye formation, we also compared octopus-eye ESTs with the completed genome sequences of other organisms. We found that 1019 out of the 1052 genes had already existed at the common ancestor of bilateria, and 875 genes were conserved between humans and octopuses. It suggests that a larger number of conserved genes and their similar gene expression may be responsible for the convergent evolution of the camera eye...|$|R
40|$|Background: Acquired, non-nevoid, {{apparently}} idiopathic facial pigmentation {{are distributed}} over some specific locations like periorbital area, zygomatic area, malar area, root of nose, perioral and mandibular area. Periorbital pigmentation {{is the most}} well known entity in this group. These are bilaterally distributed homogenously diffuse gray to dark gray or slate-gray colored patches showing progressive intensification of pigmentation. These are often considered as physiologic or constitutional pigmentation. Some portions of the margins of these patches were described previously as pigmentary demarcation line (PDL- F, G, H). Aim : To analyze the distributional patterns of acquired, apparently idiopathic facial pigmentations and to evaluate the etiologic aspects of these conditions. Materials and Methods: Spatial patterns, distribution, and orientation were analyzed among 187 individuals with idiopathic non-nevoid, facial pigmentation. Observed patterns were compared with various pigmentary nevi and Blaschko′s lines on face. Results: It was found {{that most of the}} idiopathic facial pigmentary alterations including periorbital pigmentation and PDL on face had specific patterned distribution that had high similarity to that of the pigmentary nevi and Blaschko′s lines on face. Conclusion: It is hypothesized here that phenotypic expression of acquired patterned pigmentation (AIFPFP) is due to genetically determined increased pigmentary functional activity to various known and unknown yet natural factors like UV rays and aging. Mosaicism is a definite possibility. We also consider that these patterns actually reflect the normal patterns of <b>embryological</b> <b>human</b> pigmentation on face...|$|R
40|$|Clinical research. Presentation Type: Oral Presentation Introduction: Dextrocardia is the right-sided {{positioning}} of the <b>human</b> heart during <b>embryological</b> development. It may be isolated or associated with visceral dextroposition or malformations. It is usually discovered during infancy because of associated anomalies or incidentally during adulthood. There is limited information on the associated malformations and their clinical outcomes. Methodology: This is a retrospective study that describes patients with dextrocardia at King KFSH & RC. A total of 250, 000 echocardiograms since 1990 were reviewed for demographics, associated anomalies, clinical outcomes, and mortality. Results: Three hundred and sixty patients were identified with dextrocardia. Males slightly outnumbered females with a ratio of 193 (53 %) to 167 (47 %). The majority of subjects (71 %) were children and teenagers (2 – 18  years). Isolated dextrocardia was the most commonly presented type (48 %) followed by situs inversus totalis (43 %), situs ambiguous (7 %), and situs inversus totalis variant with polysplenia or asplenia (2 %), respectively. Cyanotic heart defects were present {{in more than half}} of the subjects (54 %), while acyanotic heart defects accounted for 25 %. Non-cardiac anomalies included Scimitar syndrome (8 %), polysplenia (7 %), and asplenia (4 %). Kaplan Meier survival analysis showed highest death rates among patients with cyanotic heart defects in the first 5 years of life (Figure 1). The overall crude mortality rate is 61 per 1000 patients. Conclusion: The most common associated anomalies with dextrocardia are cyanotic heart defects, which also account for the majority of deaths in dextrocardiac patients. Scimitar syndrome was reported to be the most common non-cardiac associated anomaly in this population of interest...|$|R
40|$|The {{nature of}} Cambridge (UK) placental and fetal {{research}} in the middle third {{of the twentieth century}} is reviewed on the basis of published literature and personal recollection. Joseph Barcroft is a central figure who came to fetal research late in an extremely productive career which is briefly sketched. Contemporaneous Cambridge academics in the field included J. D. Boyd (the authors father), J. Hammond, F. H. A. Marshall, R. A. McCance, J. Needham, A. S. Parkes and Elsie Widdowson. The then current Cambridge academic geography is explained and features of its scientific life such as funding, institutional structure and ethos, teaching and clinical duties, domestic and gender roles, and political context, including war and empire, are briefly considered. The testing of research findings against general principles and use of quantitative thinking are identified as important features. Intergenerational connections, often within individual families, are identified as a striking feature. The long-term impact of Cambridge work of this period; locally, in current trophoblast and feto-placental genetic research, in Oxford in probably influencing G. S. Dawes research leadership, and internationally, especially through D. H. Barron, and through him to the Denver School, is considered. That <b>human</b> placental and <b>embryological</b> specimens collected by J. D. Boyd have received a new lease of life as the "Boyd Collection", including use by Allen Enders is noted. Mechanisms for the maintenance of scientific quality and productivity during the period, mainly through the scientist himself relying on an internalised sense of "obligation", are contrasted with those current in the UK and more widely; formal peer-review at frequent intervals, with subsequent allocation of short-term funding. The strengths and weaknesses of each are considered...|$|R
40|$|A {{medicina}} tradicionalmente vigente no Ocidente se baseava na classificação da heterogeneidade humana em diversos tipologias (compleições). Com a formulação da ciência moderna, gradualmente, a base da medicina passou a focar os fenômenos físicos e químicos que ocorrem na matéria viva. Assim, a prática clínica passa a depender do diagnóstico de entidades nosológicas, classificadas segundo seu mecanismo etiopatogênico, por sua vez, dependente de mecanismos biomoleculares. No entanto, nas primeiras décadas do século XX acontece uma explosão de classificações tipológicas numa variedade de contextos antropologia, criminologia, psicologia, pedagogia, etc. incluindo a medicina. Para abordar esse fenômeno, focou-se as teorias que afirmavam uma relação intrínseca entre as tipologias humanas e os folhetos embrionários, em particular, a obra de Marcel Martiny (1897 - 1982). A análise realizada em três esferas superpostas, levando em conta aspectos histórico-sociais, epistemológicos e historiográficos, permitiu identificar fortes componentes eugenistas nas biotipologias desenvolvidas na primeira metade do séculos XX, dentro do chamado holismo médico. Esse é também o pano de fundo do trabalho de Martiny, que utiliza como método, basicamente, medições antropométricas, cuja vinculação aos fenômenos fisiológicos e biomoleculares é realizada de maneira puramente analógica. Depois da Segunda Guerra Mundial, a teoria das biotipologias foi depurada de seus elementos eugenistas, sua falta de fundamentação empírica foi omitida e, apesar de todas suas contradições, continua a ser apresentada como ciência provada em diversos contextos, especialmente, nas abordagens médicas holistasThe {{traditional approach}} to {{medicine in the}} West was grounded on the classification of the endless human diversity in classes (complexions). With the rise of modern science, the focus of medicine gradually shifted to the physical and chemical processes proper to living matter. Consequently, {{the practice of medicine}} became dependent on the diagnosis of clinical entities, which were classified according to their etiopathogenic mechanisms, in turn dependent of biomolecular phenomena. Despite this mainstream direction, countless typological classifications burst out in {{the first decades of the}} 20 th century in a wide range of contexts anthropology, criminology, psychology, education, etc. including medicine. To understand this phenomenon, this study focused on biotypological theories grounded on the assertion that there is an intrinsic relationship between <b>human</b> types and <b>embryological</b> layers, the work by Marcel Martiny (1897 - 1982) in particular. Analysis carried out within three overlapping spheres addressing sociohistorical, epistemological and historiographical aspects allowed identifying strong eugenic element in biotypological theory as formulated in the first half of the 20 th century within the context known as medical Holism. This was also the background for Martiny, whose experimental work is restricted to anthropometric measurements that then were related with physiological and biomolecular phenomena exclusively by way of analogy. After World War I biotypological theory was depurated from all eugenic elements, whereas its lack of any empirical foundation was neglected and despite its contradictions, it is discussed even in our own days as if it were sound scienc...|$|R
