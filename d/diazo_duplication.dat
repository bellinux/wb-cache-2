Research was conducted to investigate the rate generated gas is diffused from the surface and possible film- film separations this gas may cause during contact printing. Apparatus was constructed to measure gas diffusion rates and simulated film-film separations during exposure. Diffused gas was collected in a rubber diaphragm whose expansion was measured using a variable capacitor tuned oscillator technique. To simulate printer film- film separations movement of a 5. 4 x 7. 5 cm. glass plate placed on the film was measured during exposure. A metal-halide mercury vapor lamp and optical system in the apparatus projected sufficient energy to destroy one half the potential density in 2. 4 to 5, 7 seconds. This time depended upon the type of film - 10 - 9 used. Measured gas diffusion rates ranged from 3. 3 x 10 to 9. 2 x 10 mole/sq cm/sec for the four positive working diazo films evaluated. Platefilm separations up to 2. 2 - urn were measured. It was also determined that gas release is not instantaneous upon exposure and that gas continues to be diffused after exposure has terminated. In addition exposures from {{the top and bottom}} of the emulsion produce different initial gas release rates. Analytical models were developed to correlate experimental data with printer film- film separations. Measured plate-film separations were less than predicted by the models. It is believed that the models are correct and that during the plate- film separation experiments the film had an initial curl, thus violating the parallel initial zero separation condition and explaining the differences...|$|E
