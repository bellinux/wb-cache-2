Unlike the Wilson cloud, a meteorological phenomenon in clean air, the base surge was a heavy <b>fog</b> <b>bank</b> of radioactive mist that rolled across all the target ships, coating their surfaces with fission products. When the mist in the base surge evaporated, the base surge became invisible but continued to move away, contaminating ships several miles from the detonation point.|$|E

On 15 October 1918, , a J-class submarine, was on the surface outside her base, Blythe, when she was spotted by Cymric which mistook her 'J6' marking for 'U6'. Cymric opened fire, J6 tried to signal, but the signalman was killed. J6 fled into a <b>fog</b> <b>bank,</b> but Cymric located J6 again, and sank her, with the loss of 14 lives. An order under the Official Secrets Act prohibited mention of this incident until 1969.|$|E
25|$|As Stockholm and Andrea Doria were {{approaching}} each other head-on, in the heavily used shipping corridor, the westbound Andrea Doria had been traveling in heavy fog for hours. The captain had reduced speed slightly from , activated the ship's fog-warning whistle, and had closed the watertight doors, all customary precautions while sailing in such conditions. However, the eastbound Stockholm {{had yet to}} enter what was apparently {{the edge of a}} <b>fog</b> <b>bank</b> and was seemingly unaware of it and the movement of the other ship hidden in it. The waters of the North Atlantic south of Nantucket Island are frequently the site of intermittent fog as the cold Labrador Current encounters the Gulf Stream.|$|E

25|$|On October 26, 1944, WASP pilot Gertrude Tompkins Silver of the 601st Ferrying Squadron, 5th Ferrying Group, Love Field, Dallas, Texas, {{departed}} Los Angeles Airport, in North American P-51D Mustang, 44-15669, at 1600 hrs PWT, {{headed for}} the East Coast. She took off into the wind, into an offshore <b>fog</b> <b>bank,</b> and was expected that night at Palm Springs. She never arrived. Due to a paperwork foul-up, a search did not get under way for several days, and while the eventual search of land and sea was massive, it failed to find a trace of Silver or her plane.

25|$|On 11 February, {{the communists}} {{attacked}} in two locations. Two companies of Dac Cong attacked LS 22 that evening, but were repelled {{by the close}} air support of three AC-47 gunships; 76 dead communists were found in LS 22's defensive wire. LS 22 held. That same day, intruding communists from two sapper battalions threw tear gas into the defenders' trenches at the Routes 7/71 intersection. That sufficed to cause one Royalist irregular unit, Brown Battalion, to withdraw toward LS 22 after desultory resistance. The other monarchist battalions soon followed. The following day, the 148th and 174th PAVN Regiments infiltrated under cover of a <b>fog</b> <b>bank</b> to overrun the 7/71 road fork and captured the 155mm howitzer abandoned there. The communists now held the entry portal to the Plain, and were free to begin phase two of Campaign 139. The communists spent the next four days reorganizing while Vang Pao rallied his fleeing troops into defensive positions centered on LS 22.|$|E
25|$|On April 26 {{the pirates}} {{captured}} the ship Mary Anne with a hold full of Madeira wine. The captain of Mary Anne refused Bellamy's request to pilot {{them up the}} coast, so Bellamy arrested the captain and five of his crew and brought them aboard Whydah Gally, leaving three of the original crew aboard Mary Anne. Then Bellamy sent 7 of his own men onboard of Mary Anne - {{one of whom was}} the carpenter Thomas South who had been forced by Bellamy and his crew to make repairs; not wanting to join the pirate crew he had been offered release by Bellamy after work was completed, but the surviving pirates later testified to the court that they had over-ruled Bellamy's decision and forced South to stay due to his much whimpering and complaining. South testified that it was his choice to accompany the 6 pirates going aboard Mary Anne in hopes of escaping, possibly by jumping overboard and swimming ashore as they drew near to the Cape. Sometime around sunset that evening, the winds completely died, and a massive <b>fog</b> <b>bank</b> made visibility virtually nil. The four ships in Bellamy's fleet lost sight of one another. Bellamy's ships Anne (captained by his quartermaster Richard Noland) and Fisher moved out to sea (eventually making it to Damariscove Island with heavy damage). Williams had turned the Marianne away earlier, putting into Block Island to visit relatives but agreeing to meet Bellamy later off Maine.|$|E

500|$|By noon, she was 140 {{miles off}} the {{southwest}} coast of England. This section of the English coast was hazardous, due to shallow waters, sharp rocks, and often-dense fog, so it was normally avoided by ships. By the afternoon Suevic had entered a typically dense <b>fog</b> <b>bank.</b> By 10 pm, the ship's officers {{were not able to}} fix their position using stellar navigation, so they intended to use instead the Lizard lighthouse on Lizard Point, Cornwall (known simply as [...] "The Lizard"), which they soon spotted. Upon seeing the light, they calculated that it was at least 10 miles away, and thus thought themselves safe. Despite the fog, they pressed ahead at full speed, without using the sounding line to ensure they were not approaching the shore.|$|E
500|$|Admiral Lütjens gave {{permission}} for Prinz Eugen to engage Suffolk, though {{the captain of}} the German cruiser could not clearly make out his target and so held fire. Suffolk quickly retreated to a safe distance and shadowed the German ships. At 20:30, the heavy cruiser [...] joined Suffolk, but approached the German raiders too closely. Lütjens ordered his ships to engage the British cruiser; Bismarck fired five salvoes, three of which straddled Norfolk and rained shell splinters on her decks. The cruiser laid a smoke screen and fled into a <b>fog</b> <b>bank,</b> ending the brief engagement. The concussion from the 38cm guns disabled Bismarcks FuMo 23 radar set; this prompted Lütjens to order Prinz Eugen to take station ahead so she could use her functioning radar to scout for the formation.|$|E

2500|$|One {{important}} consideration {{which will not}} necessarily be obvious in modern times of radar, GPS, and depth-sounders, {{is the degree to}} which navigational skill and experience on a particular route played in making sure each run was completed safely and profitably: the steamboats could not stop running at night or in bad weather. [...] Heavy fog was particularly hazardous, and could come any time of year. [...] Once a steamboat was in a <b>fog</b> <b>bank,</b> a captain would have to reckon very carefully from his experience on the run just where his boat was. [...] With no radar, captains proved remarkably adept at determining their position with echoes from the steamboat's whistle. [...] Sound travels at about 1,080 feet per second in a <b>fog</b> <b>bank,</b> and rounding off to 1,000 feet for safety, that meant that if an echo was heard one second after the whistle blast, the steamboat was 500 feet from shore.

2500|$|The {{advection}} of fog {{along the}} California coastline is propelled onto land {{by one of}} several processes. A cold front can push the marine layer coast-ward, an occurrence most typical in the spring or late fall. During the summer months, a low pressure trough produced by intense heating inland creates a strong pressure gradient, drawing in the dense marine layer. Also during the summer, strong high pressure aloft over the desert southwest, usually {{in connection with the}} summer monsoon, produces a south to southeasterly flow which can drive the offshore marine layer up the coastline; a phenomenon known as a [...] "southerly surge", typically following a coastal heat spell. However, if the monsoonal flow is sufficiently turbulent, it might instead break up the marine layer and any fog it may contain. Moderate turbulence will typically transform a <b>fog</b> <b>bank,</b> lifting it and breaking it up into shallow convective clouds called stratocumulus.|$|E
