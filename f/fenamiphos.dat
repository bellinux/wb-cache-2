5000|$|Many {{different}} methods to control nematodes {{have been tried}} over the years. Some have proven more successful and others have not. Some of these methods include nematicides, cover crops, crop rotation, genetically modified plants and seed treatments. In soybeans, Essex is a tolerant cultivar whereas Forrest is sensitive. Essex has a higher yield in fields that are infested with the nematode. The plots in this study by Koenning were treated with aldicarb, carbofuran, and <b>fenamiphos</b> and had less nematodes 40 days post planting then the areas that were not treated. The plots that were planted with Forrest which is the sensitive cultivar and treated with carbofuran had a higher yield than untreated control plots. Damage threshold levels have not been well established but using fumigated plots has shown significant increases in yield. [...] In Brazil, many crops are planted under the no tillage planting system. This typically causes of buildup of polyphagous species of nematodes like P. brachyurus. [...] If a no till system is being used, planting cover crops that would decrease {{the density of the}} nematodes may be needed. The problem with that is there is contradictory information regarding P. brachyurus and which plants are poor or good hosts. Due to this very same reason, farmers would {{have to be very careful}} in choosing a crop rotation schedule as well. [...] In 1992 Vast demonstrated that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi could enhanced the plant’s resistance to nematodes by being a physical barrier. [...] This would be something that could be used as a seed treatment to protect the newly emerging seedlings from being infested.|$|E

Population densities of Pythium aphanidermatum, P. myriotylum, and Rhizoctonia solani in soil after planting vegetables were suppressed by 2 - or 3 -year sod compared with fallow but were not affected by <b>fenamiphos.</b> Yields of snapbean, pepper, and okra did not differ between fallow and 1 -year sod. In the final year of the study, yields of all crops were greater following 3 -year sod than following fallow. Application of <b>fenamiphos</b> prior to planting each crop following fallow or sod did not affect yields...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTwo outdoor pot {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} two consecutive years under outdoor conditions during the wheat growing season in Saudi Arabia {{to determine the effects}} of urea and certain compound fertilizers (NPK), compared to the effects of the nematicide <b>fenamiphos</b> on the cereal cyst nematode (CCN), Heterodera avenae, and wheat growth. The results showed that all of the treatments, except the fertilizer diammonium phosphate (DAP), reduced the number of nematode cysts/root system and increased (P⩽ 0. 05) the dry weight of nematode-infected wheat plants. <b>Fenamiphos</b> and urea resulted in the best control, followed by the NPK fertilizers. The combined application of urea and <b>fenamiphos</b> resulted in the most significant effect in decreasing (P⩽ 0. 05) the number of cysts/root system and increasing (P⩽ 0. 05) the growth of nematode-infected wheat plants...|$|E
40|$|EPA has {{assessed}} {{the risks of}} <b>fenamiphos</b> and prepared an Interim Reregistration Eligibility Decision (IRED) document for this organophosphate (OP) pesticide. The IRED identifies risk mitigation measures needed to reduce risk, as well as data needed to better characterize risks. The sole registrant, Bayer Corporation, has requested voluntary cancellation of all existing <b>fenamiphos</b> registrations rather than committing to develop additional data. Used on variety of vegetables and fruits, <b>fenamiphos</b> residues in food do not pose risk concerns. However, exposure to drinking water sources from shallow water tables (less than 50 feet deep) and extremely vulnerable soils do pose risk concerns. Extremely vulnerable soils are defined as, “hydrologic soil group A soils that are excessively drained and predominantly sand or loamy sand such as soils in the suborder psamments. ” These classifications and soi...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} Caenorhabditis elegans {{to recover from}} {{exposure}} to high doses of aldicarb and <b>fenamiphos</b> was examined at the organismal and biochemical levels by determination of movement and acetylcholinesterase activity. Nematodes recovered rapidly from a 24 -hour exposure to both compounds at concentrations that caused complete paralysis. Acetylcholinesterase regained nearly full activity after a 24 -hour exposure to aldicarb but only 10 % activity after exposure to <b>fenamiphos.</b> The nematodes were able to move normally, however, on the limited activity that was regained after <b>fenamiphos</b> treatment. Mutant C. elegans strains deficient in various molecular forms of acetylcholinesterase were utilized {{to demonstrate that the}} mechanism of recovery did not involve new synthesis of enzyme. This result was confirmed by experiments on acetylcholinesterase reactivation from live versus dead nematodes...|$|E
40|$|Ethoprop and {{disodium}} tetrathiocarbonate (TTC) {{were evaluated}} as replacements of <b>fenamiphos</b> and 1, 3 -dichloropropene (1, 3 -D) {{for control of}} Rotylenchulus reniformis on pineapple in Hawaii. Treatments were established in a field on the Del Monte Fresh Fruit (Hawaii) plantation in spring 1991. Preplant soil treatments consisted of fumigation with 1, 3 -D at 226 kg a. i. /ha and TTC at 135 kg or 270 kg a. i. /ha. Postplant nematicides for the 1, 3 -D treated plots were <b>fenamiphos</b> (3. 4 kg a. i. /ha trimonthly) and ethoprop (3. 4 or 6. 7 kg a. i. /ha monthly). Tetrathiocarbonate was applied postplant to the TTC-treated plots every 2 months at 67 kg a. i. /ha. Nematode population densities were monitored in all plots at 3 -month intervals. Tetrathiocarbonate was not effective in reducing the preplant soil population densities of R. reniformis or limiting subsequent nematode damage to the plants. Ethoprop and <b>fenamiphos</b> reduced nematode damage, resulting in greater yield {{in the first and}} second crop harvests (P < 0. 05). Ethoprop was an effective alternative to <b>fenamiphos</b> for control of R. reniformis in pineapple...|$|E
40|$|Repeated {{treatment}} with <b>fenamiphos</b> (ethyl 4 -methylthio-m-tolyl isopropylphosphoramidate) resulted in en-hanced biodegradation of this nematicide in two United Kingdom soils {{with a high}} pH (> 7. 7). In contrast, degradation of <b>fenamiphos</b> was slow in three acidic United Kingdom soils (pH 4. 7 to 6. 7), and repeated treatments {{did not result in}} enhanced biodegradation. Rapid degradation of <b>fenamiphos</b> was observed in two Australian soils (pH 6. 7 to 6. 8) in which it was no longer biologically active against plant nematodes. Enhanced degrading capability was readily transferred from Australian soil to United Kingdom soils, but only those with a high pH were able to maintain this capability for extended periods of time. This result was confirmed by fingerprinting bacterial communities by 16 S rRNA gene profiling of extracted DNA. Only United Kingdom soils with a high pH retained bacterial DNA bands originating from the fenamiphos-degrading Australian soil. A degrading consortium was enriched from the Australian soil that utilized <b>fenamiphos</b> as a sole source of carbon. The 16 S rRNA banding pattern (determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) from the isolated consortium migrated to the same position as the bands from the Australian soil and those from the enhanced United Kingdom soils in which the Australian soil had been added. When the bands from the consortium and the soil were sequenced and compared they showed between 97 and 100 % sequence identity, confirming that these groups of bacteria were involved in degrading <b>fenamiphos</b> in the soils. The sequences obtained showed similarity to those from the genera Pseudomonas...|$|E
40|$|Field {{trials were}} {{conducted}} during 1986, 1988, 1989, and 1991 {{to compare the}} effects of 1, 3 -dichloropropene, <b>fenamiphos,</b> and carbofuran on yield and quality of chile peppers (Capsicum annuum) in soil infested with Meloidogyne incognita. When compared with untreated plots, numbers of M. incognita juveniles recovered from soil 60 and(or) 90 days after chile pepper emergence were reduced (P = 0. 05) following 1, 3 -D treatment every year except 1986. Nematode numbers were also reduced (P = 0. 05) by <b>fenamiphos</b> in 1989. Chile pepper yields {{were significantly higher than}} those in untreated control plots (P = 0. 05) all 4 years in plots treated with 1, 3 -D and in 1989 in plots treated with <b>fenamiphos.</b> Use of carbofuran did not significantly reduce nematode numbers or enhance yields in these experiments. Green chile pepper fruit quality was enhanced (P = 0. 05) following 1, 3 -D treatments in 1988 and 1989 but was unaffected by <b>fenamiphos</b> or carbofuran application. Increasing placement depth of 1, 3 -D from 28 to 48 cm increased (P = 0. 05) red chile pepper yield compared with that obtained with conventional placement in 1988 only, and did not affect green chile pepper yield...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{alachlor}} (2. 25 kg a. i. /ha) and <b>fenamiphos</b> (2. 25 kg a. i. /ha) on the penetration {{and development of}} Heterodera glycines were examined on Glycine max cultivars Deltapine 105 planted 29 April, 29 May, and 29 June 1986 and Deltapine 105 and Centennial planted 15 May, 15 June, and 15 July 1987. Penetration was lowest on the third planting of soybeans and on fenamiphos-treated plants. Development from second-stage juveniles to adult females required 270 (1986) and 260 (1987) DD 20 / 32 on roots from the first planting control and alachlor treatments. <b>Fenamiphos,</b> alone or with alachlor, retarded development in Deltapine 105 (1986) and in Centennial (1987). Males matured in roots from the second planting in 190 (1986) and 180 (1987) DD 20 / 32 regardless of treatment or cultivar. No development occurred in roots from the third planting until 400 DD 20 / 32 in 1986, but in 1987 development {{was similar to that}} in roots from the second planting. Nematode development was similar in alachlor-treated and control roots regardless of planting date. <b>Fenamiphos</b> restricted nematode penetration on most planting dates and slowed development. Simultaneous applications of alachlor and <b>fenamiphos</b> usually also inhibited development...|$|E
