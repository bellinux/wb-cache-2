So even though I could not take success for granted, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> elected to do the job.

[...] Looking back on the experience, Goldsmith later said, [...] "After starting to write {{what was to be}} a big fireworks extravaganza, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> writing about the city where I was born and had lived my entire life. [...] I decided instead to make the piece a grand celebration of my childhood, growing years, my years of maturity, and all the events that climaxed with my first appearance at the Hollywood Bowl." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{light of}} Wilson's {{increasingly}} fragile mental state, the group tensions, and his signing to Warner Bros., Parks's involvement in Smile effectively ceased on April 14, 1967, {{when he left}} to begin work on his solo career. Giving his reasons, he said, [...] "I {{walked away from the}} situation as soon as <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> causing friction between him and his other group members, and I didn't want to be the person to do that. I thought that was Brian's responsibility to bring definition to his own life. I stepped in, perhaps, I 'took a leap before I looked'. I don't know, but that's the way I feel about it.…As soon as I found out I was entering an eat or be eaten situation... I was raised differently. I didn't {{want to be part of}} that game." [...] Recording sessions ground to a halt soon after, as Wilson became increasingly withdrawn, and the album was shelved a few months later.|$|E

2500|$|To {{coincide}} {{with the release of}} Get Out, Peele curated a film series for the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) called The Art of the Social Thriller. The series featured classic horror films like [...] Rosemary's Baby, Night of the Living Dead, The Shining, The Silence of the Lambs, Candyman, The People Under the Stairs, and the first film of Wes Craven's Scream series. Peele also included films outside of the horror genre, such as psychological thrillers Funny Games and Misery, Hitchcock's mystery thriller Rear Window, and comedy-thriller The 'Burbs. The sneak preview of Get Out was preceded by the 1967 comedy-drama Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, the first Hollywood film to address interracial marriage and a big influence on the premise for Peele's own film. When asked about its inclusion in the series, Peele told the Village Voice, [...] "It’s not an actual thriller, it’s just a great exploration of the social phenomenon of how we deal with race, putting it in a package that everyone can understand. Anybody can relate to the fear of meeting your potential in-laws for the first time... At a certain point with Get Out, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> making a sort of thriller take on Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner." ...|$|E
2500|$|We flew at 13,440 feet (4,800 meters) {{above sea}} level and our speed was 540 knots. [...] A little bit after {{completing}} a turn to the northwest, we identified a patrol of four MiG-21s in spread formation {{at a distance of}} 5 miles –about 8 km- at ‘2 o’clock’ and below us. Two more MiGs appeared 2 miles –about 3 km - behind[...] [...] [...] When the MiGs crossed in front of Stone, he started to follow, breaking left and losing height. Due to that, the flight spread wide to the right, and I found myself higher and somewhat {{to the right of the}} others. I kept the throttle to the minimum during the first phase of the combat. So, when the MiGs broke to the left, and the engagement began. I chose one of the MiGs and followed him with my radar. I don't think that we ever exceeded 4G's during the whole engagement. I decided to follow the Navy pilots' tactics - at close range foregoing the radar tracking, but looking through the reticle instead. When <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in the right position, I pushed the fire button, released it, pushed it again, and waited. I did not even see the first Sparrow. However, I followed the entire trajectory of the second one, from launch to impact. I fired the missiles at less than 2,000 yards from the MiG’s tail, at a height of 9,800 feet (3,500 meters) while turning to the left. The second one hit the tail section of the enemy aircraft. A second later, I saw a huge, orange ball of fire.|$|E

60|$|By {{the looks}} and {{comments}} which this produced, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a degraded object; I was cruelly ashamed of myself. I determined to reform.

60|$|But {{that night}} <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> once more a useless, lonely old woman.

Nelson was standing there, and he said, without wasting any words--it was easy to see how that man managed to get railroads built where nobody else could manage it--that he had called to see me on a little matter of business.|$|E
60|$|The chauffeur {{started the}} car off again. What with the shock I had had and the luxury of riding in a motor-car, I was a little distrait, and I could not say how far we went. But {{it must have been}} miles and miles, for it seemed a long time {{afterwards}} that we stopped at the biggest house I have ever seen. There were smooth lawns and flower-beds, and men in overalls, and fountains and trees, and, away to the right, kennels with about a million dogs in them, all pushing their noses through the bars and shouting. They all wanted to know who I was and what prizes I had won, and then <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> moving in high society.|$|E

60|$|As {{they were}} my friends, I don't care to say how it came about that I had this strange and, I believe unique, experience. They {{considered}} it a practical joke, though it nearly unhinged my reason. Suffice it that last Wednesday, when I called on them at their new house, I was taken up stairs and shown into a large room with a pictorial wall paper. There was a pop-gun {{on the table and}} a horse with three legs on the floor. In a moment it flashed through my mind that I must be in a nursery. I started back, and then, with a sinking at the heart, I heard the key turn in the lock. From the corner came a strange uncanny moan. Slowly I forced my head round and looked, and a lump rose in my throat, and <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> alone with It.|$|E

I don't say she {{proposed}} to him out and out, but, mind you, Anne, it wasn't far from it. I couldn't do anything like that. I DID try once. When <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> getting sere and mellow, and all the girls of my generation were going off on either hand, I tried to give Ludovic a hint. But it stuck in my throat. And now I don't mind. If I don't change Dix to Speed until I take the initiative, it will be Dix {{to the end of}} life. Ludovic doesn't realize that we are growing old, you know. He thinks we are giddy young folks yet, with plenty of time before us. That's the Speed failing. They never find out they're alive until they're dead." ...|$|E
6000|$|On {{the fourth}} night temptation came, and I was {{not strong enough}} to resist. When I had gazed at the disk awhile I pretended to be sleepy, and began to nod. Straightway came the {{professor}} and made passes over my head and down my body and legs and arms, finishing each pass with a snap of his fingers in the air, to discharge the surplus electricity; then he began to [...] "draw" [...] me with the disk, holding it in his fingers and telling me I could not take my eyes off it, try as I might; so I rose slowly, bent and gazing, and followed that disk all over the place, just as I had seen the others do. Then I was put through the other paces. Upon suggestion I fled from snakes; passed buckets at a fire; became excited over hot steamboat-races; made love to imaginary girls and kissed them; fished from the platform and landed mud-cats that outweighed me--and so on, all the customary marvels. But not in the customary way. I was cautious at first, and watchful, being afraid the professor would discover that I was an impostor and drive me from the platform in disgrace; but as soon as <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not in danger, I set myself the task of terminating Hicks's usefulness as a subject, and of usurping his place.|$|E
