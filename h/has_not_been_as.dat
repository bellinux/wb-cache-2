Since 2006, pre-school children have been given the opportunity to learn indigenous Kanak languages. While the Kanak languages have been taught in high schools across the Loyalty Islands and North Province, the language education <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>as</b> common in the more European South Province.

The examination is held over two consecutive days; each day the contestants have four-and-a-half hours to solve three problems. The problems chosen are from various areas {{of secondary school}} mathematics, broadly classifiable as geometry, number theory, algebra, and combinatorics. They require no knowledge of higher mathematics such as calculus and analysis, and solutions are often short and elementary. However, they are usually disguised {{so as to make}} the solutions difficult. Prominently featured are algebraic inequalities, complex numbers, and construction-oriented geometrical problems, though in recent years the latter <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>as</b> popular as before.|$|E
5|$|Unusually for a river, the Saw Mill's waters have {{consistently}} had a slightly alkaline pH, suggesting it <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>as</b> affected by acid rain as other Hudson tributaries. In 1951, a state Department of Health survey reported pH between 7.25 and 9.1. Four decades later, another study found pH readings rising steadily from 7.59 in Chappaqua to 8.24 in Yonkers. Similarly, a 2007 Manhattan College study {{done for the}} New York State Water Resources Institute found a median low of 7.36 in Chappaqua and a median high of 7.81 near Torre Road in Yonkers, with a drop to 7.67 at the tunnel, for a total median for the river of 7.59. The lowest recorded pH in the year-long study was 7.1 at Chappaqua with the highest reading, 8.17, at Torre Road. All results were between 6.5 and 8.5, the range required by state regulations.|$|E

25|$|Because the {{previously}} popular fumigant methyl bromide has been phased {{out in some}} countries under the Montreal Protocol, phosphine is the only widely used, cost-effective, rapidly acting fumigant that does not leave residues on the stored product. Pests {{with high levels of}} resistance toward phosphine have become common in Asia, Australia and Brazil. High level resistance is also likely to occur in other regions, but <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>as</b> closely monitored. Genetic variants that contribute to high level resistance to phosphine have been identified in the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase gene. Identification of this gene now allows rapid molecular identification of resistant insects.|$|E

25|$|The {{distinction}} {{on whether}} an uprising is an insurgency or a belligerency <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>as</b> clearly codified {{as many other}} areas covered by the internationally accepted laws of war for two reasons. The first is that international law traditionally does not encroach on matters that are solely {{the internal affairs of}} a sovereign state, but recent developments such as the responsibility to protect, are starting to undermine the traditional approach. The second is that at the Hague Conference of 1899, there was disagreement between the Great Powers who considered francs-tireurs to be unlawful combatants subject to execution on capture, and smaller states, which maintained that they should be considered lawful combatants. The dispute resulted in a compromise wording being included in the Hague Conventions known as the Martens Clause from the diplomat who drafted the clause.|$|E
25|$|One source has {{described}} Montoto's list of close friends as “tainted by controversy: {{in addition to}} Scioli, Firmenich, and the late Rodolfo Galimberti, another ex-Montonero who became a businessman, he maintains close friendships with media entrepreneur Daniel Hadad and consultant Alejandra Rafuls, {{who is responsible for}} his press relations.” Montoto also has close links to Finmeccanica, the scandal-plagued Italian arms firm. A January 2011 report, moreover, stated that the 2011 appointment of Nilda Garre as Security Minister provided Montoto with an opportunity “to equip the Federal Police, security forces, Gendarmerie and Prefectura” with security products. The report said that “Montoto and Garre have a special relationship” founded in their history as members of the Montoneros. Another source, however, has stated that Montoto's relationship with Garre <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>as</b> friendly as his relationships with former Defense Ministers José Pampuro and Arturo Puricelli, and that, by the same token, he is not as close to Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner as he was to Menem and Nestor Kirchner.|$|E
25|$|In several {{technical}} fields, in particular, computer science, mathematics, engineering, and physics, TeX {{has become}} a de facto standard. Many thousands of books have been published using TeX, including books published by Addison-Wesley, Cambridge University Press, Elsevier, Oxford University Press and Springer. Numerous journals in these fields are produced using TeX or LaTeX, allowing authors to submit their raw manuscript written in TeX. While many publications in other fields, including dictionaries and legal publications, have been produced using TeX, it <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>as</b> successful as in more technical fields, because TeX was primarily designed for mathematics. When he designed TeX, Donald Knuth {{did not believe that}} a single typesetting system would fit everyone's needs; instead, he designed many hooks inside the program so that {{it would be possible to}} write extensions, and released the source code, hoping that publishers would design versions tailored to their needs. While such extensions have been created (including some by Knuth himself), most people have extended TeX only using macros and it has remained a system associated with technical typesetting.|$|E

500|$|Lee was not exultant, but [...] "deeply, bitterly disappointed" [...] at the result. [...] "Our success <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>as</b> great or {{complete}} {{as we should}} have desired", Lee wrote to his wife.

[...] Lee did not distribute blame for the failure to reach his desired result, but there were repercussions. Several commanders were reassigned, including Theophilus Holmes and John Magruder, and his army was reorganized into two wings, one under Stonewall Jackson and another under James Longstreet. Further, Confederate artillery would now be moved in battalion-sized units, {{at the head of}} Confederate columns.|$|E
500|$|The two-colored bolete {{has several}} {{species that are}} similar to it and the {{differences}} are minute in most cases. Boletus sensibilis differs from the two-colored bolete in that it has an immediate bruising reaction and is poisonous, causing stomach upset if ingested, and in some cases a severe allergic reaction. B.miniato-olivaceus has a full yellow stem and slightly lighter cap coloration. It also has a more immediate bruising reaction than the two-colored bolete and the stem is slightly longer in proportion to the cap. B.peckii differs from the two-colored bolete by having a smaller average size, a rose red cap that turns almost brown with age, flesh that is paler in color, and a bitter taste. B.speciosus differs from the two-colored bolete by having a fully reticulated stem, more brilliant colors, and very narrow cylindrical spores. Hortiboletus rubellus subsp. rubens and the two-colored bolete have been found to have almost no difference between them, and they cannot be distinguished by appearance alone. Boletus bicoloroide is very similar to the two-colored bolete, the major differences between them being B.bicoloroide has only been found in Michigan and has larger spores. B.bicoloroide is also slightly larger than the two-colored bolete, around [...] longer in the stem and [...] in the cap. This species <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>as</b> thoroughly researched as the two-colored bolete, thus macrochemical tests, edibility, distribution range, and the spore print color are all unknown.|$|E
