Following the show, Variety reported that ABC was, in negotiating an extension to its contract to broadcast the Oscars, seeking {{to have more}} creative control over the broadcast itself. Currently and nominally, AMPAS is responsible for most aspects of the telecast, including the choice of production staff and hosting, although ABC is allowed to have some input on their decisions. In August 2016, AMPAS extended its contract with ABC through 2028: the contract does not contain any notable changes, nor gives ABC any further creative control over the telecast.|$|E
