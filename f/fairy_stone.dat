50|$|Some {{builders}} {{used to use}} {{a technique}} {{to see if the}} planned construction {{was going to be on}} a fairy path; they would map out the floor plan in the earth and place a pile of stones at each corner and leave it overnight, if the stones were undisturbed it was safe to build, otherwise the work would not continue. There is another theme that states if one's house is on a fairy path, one must leave the doors and windows open at night, front and back, to allow fairies to pass through. Builders were also advised against using white quartz in their stonework, as it is said to be a <b>fairy</b> <b>stone.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Son of Kfer and slave knight serving under Glenn, his swordsmanship {{is almost}} {{on the same}} level as Koinzell, thought Ms. Gleaa stated that he is more skilled than Ascheriit who is in fact Koinzell. He's been {{studying}} under Ms. Gleaa for 5 years and was told if he killed the Hero Slayer, he'd regain his title as Imperial Royalty. He has a little brother. He is the empire's most skilled swordsman and {{is said to be the}} next to inherit the title 'Blatt Meister' (...) after Ascheriit. Ikfes confronts Koinzell after he slays Barestar and the two engage in a brutal sword fight. Ikfes acknowledges Koinzell's skill with a sword but still believes his skill is superior. The battle ends however, when Koinzell uses the 'Black Wings' technique, the ultimate skill only a 'Blatt Meister' would know, to shatter Ikfes' sword and injure his arm. His defeat causes Ikfes to become more obsessed with defeating Koinzell. It has been revealed that Ikfes is related to one of the Four Lances of Betrayal, which is how he lost his status as imperial royalty. He was given Ascheriit's <b>Fairy</b> <b>Stone</b> Sword by Glenn, which he presumably stole from Asceriit after betraying and murdering him. At the end of their second duel Koinzell once again uses the Black Wings and injures Ikfes in doing so. Ikfes blames Kfer's, revealed to be his father and is Koinzell's friend, sword technique which he acquired as the reason for his losses. Koinzell tells Ikfes that Kfer's technique was incorporated into the Black Wings, the Blatt Meister's technique, and that he should not be ashamed of his heritage. Ikfes then uses the technique on Koinzell to defeat him, but does not kill him, saying instead that he still wants to learn things from Koinzell. However, as Ikfes reaches out to Koinzell to pull him to his feet, Lebelond uses his flying castle's main cannon to blast Koinzell. After the massacre of Jebr, Ikfes is hailed as a hero and becomes the newest 'Blatt Meister', thus repairing [...] "The Mansion of Swords" [...] name. He then thrust into Lebelont's war effort. But he is now very conflicted with his actions, and wonders if he is following the sword of justice as his mother had hoped. Koinzell admit that Ikfes is one of few people whom he fears their sword. After the truth is revealed about his father, Ikfes tries to force Koinzell into a duel to the death in hopes that Koinzell will kill him for having served the men who killed his parents, but Koinzell ultimately defeats him mentally and forces him to stand down.|$|E
