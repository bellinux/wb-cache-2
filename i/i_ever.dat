5|$|He was {{the most}} amazing and ingenious combat pilot <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> saw. He was also very lucky on many occasions. He thought nothing of jumping into a fight outnumbered ten to one, often alone, with us {{trying to catch up}} to him. He {{violated}} every cardinal rule of fighter combat. He abandoned all the rules.|$|E

5|$|It {{was first}} time <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> swung wood full time. I was {{learning}} how to play pro ball. I had never played every day in my life. That's totally different.... You {{have to learn to}} conserve your energy. In college, you just left it all out on the field every game. In pro ball, you do that and you'll wear out, because you play every single day.|$|E
5|$|Not doing {{anything}} creative is nearly killing me. The {{trouble is that}} there is no one near me who cares whether <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> do any more work or not...

5|$|The song's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Joseph Kahn and produced by Danyi Deats-Barrett. The concept of the video was conceived by Clarkson and depicts her as a bride who experiences some dream-like hints that her husband-to-be is {{having an affair with}} a brunette ceremony attendee. The music video premiered online at MTV and it also received heavy rotation on Total Request Live. The song was performed live by Clarkson at numerous venues, including the Breakaway World Tour (2005) and the All <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> Wanted Tour (2009).|$|E

The first PBR <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> had was at the Jockey Club, this really old-school punk-rock bar on Killingsworth. As far as the very first ones, there was the Lutz and EJ's, and it's always been our thought that Lutz was first.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the grandest}} sight <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> experienced, {{to look out}} of the {{lighthouse}} on a very stormy day, and see oneself hanging, as it were, over the ocean, surrounded on three sides by a fearful chasm in which the air was so thickly crowded with birds as to produce {{the appearance of a}} heavy snowstorm, whilst the cries of these myriads, mingled with the roar of the ocean and the howling of the tremendous gusts of wind coming up from below as if forced through a blast pipe, made it almost impossible to hear a person speak.|$|E

25|$|Clarkson's fourth album, All <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> Wanted, was {{released}} on March 10, 2009. Clarkson continued to co-write her own material, {{but this time she}} returned to a mainstream-oriented sound by reuniting with previous collaborators Dr. Luke, Martin, and DioGuardi, and new collaborators Howard Benson, Claude Kelly, Ryan Tedder, Glen Ballard, Matt Thiessen and Katy Perry in contributing tracks for the album. The release of All <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> Wanted was met with positive acclaim from music critics for its lighter themes. The album was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 and staying there for two weeks. The album has sold 960,000 copies in the U.S. and garnered Clarkson a nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 52nd Grammy Awards.|$|E
