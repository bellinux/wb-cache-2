5|$|Denial of {{responsibility}} via language that obscures awareness of personal responsibility. It {{is said that}} we deny responsibility for our actions when we attribute their cause to: vague impersonal forces ("I had to"); our condition, diagnosis, personal or psychological history; the actions of others; the <b>dictates</b> <b>of</b> authority; group pressure; institutional policy, rules, and regulations; gender roles, social roles, or age roles; or uncontrollable impulses.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} was not uniform in approach; British and French forces were {{limited by the}} <b>dictates</b> <b>of</b> the wider Mediterranean and global conflict, and consequently ship numbers fluctuated. Although numerous commanders held commands in the region, {{the two most important}} personalities were those of William Hoste and Bernard Dubourdieu, whose exploits were celebrated in their respective national newspapers during 1810 and 1811. The campaign between the two officers reached a climax at the Battle of Lissa in March 1811, when Dubourdieu was killed and his squadron defeated by Hoste in a celebrated action.|$|E
25|$|A crucial {{factor in}} this development, which saw a trend toward monumental architecture, was the {{invention}} of Roman concrete (opus caementicium), {{which led to the}} liberation of shapes from the <b>dictates</b> <b>of</b> the traditional materials of stone and brick.|$|E

25|$|Alternative {{accounts}} {{describe that}} the Dutch first {{opened fire on}} the Balinese people moving outside of the palace gate, only equipped with traditional krises, spears and shields, and that survivors killed themselves, or had themselves killed by their followers according to the <b>dictates</b> <b>of</b> the puputan.|$|E
25|$|Although Leopold himself {{sought to}} avoid war {{and made the}} {{declaration}} to satisfy the Comte d'Artois and the other émigrés, the reaction within France was ferocious. The French people expressed no respect for the <b>dictates</b> <b>of</b> foreign monarchs, {{and the threat of}} force merely hastened their militarisation.|$|E
25|$|External- The {{external}} {{factors that affect}} it are authority, peer influence and external rewards. Complying with the <b>dictates</b> <b>of</b> an authority figure such as boss {{has been shown to}} be an inducement to high goal commitment. Goal commitment increases when the authority figure is physically present, supportive, pay increases, peer pressure and external rewards.|$|E

25|$|The wedding news {{made the}} front-page of the New York Times. The {{marriage}} took her father by surprise, {{and he was}} stunned upon reading about it. The bride's mother, however, {{who was at the}} time divorced from Mr. Mackay, wanted her daughter to follow the <b>dictates</b> <b>of</b> her own heart. Irving had in fact gone to her mother's home before the wedding and had obtained her blessing.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the leaders}} of the Transcendental {{movement}} was Henry David Thoreau, a nonconformist and a close friend of Emerson. After living mostly by himself for two years in a cabin by a wooded pond, Thoreau wrote Walden, a memoir that urges resistance to the <b>dictates</b> <b>of</b> society. Thoreau's writings demonstrate a strong American tendency toward individualism. Other Transcendentalists included Amos Bronson Alcott, Margaret Fuller, George Ripley, Orestes Brownson, and Jones Very.|$|E
25|$|Brown consecrated Francis Schuckardt {{without a}} pontifical mandate (i.e. {{permission}} from the Pope), which is normally required by the Code of Canon Law under penalty of excommunication. However, traditionalists cite over a dozen historical instances where Bishops were legitimately consecrated {{in a period of}} sede vacante. Traditionalists also point out the superiority of the essential doctrine of Apostolic Authority over the changeable <b>dictates</b> <b>of</b> ecclesiastical law, and hold that Christ would not leave his flock without shepherds.|$|E

25|$|Kant {{defined the}} Enlightenment as an age {{shaped by the}} Latin motto Sapere aude ("Dare to be wise"). Kant {{maintained}} that one ought to think autonomously, free of the <b>dictates</b> <b>of</b> external authority. His work reconciled many {{of the differences between}} the rationalist and empiricist traditions of the 18th century. He had a decisive impact on the Romantic and German Idealist philosophies of the 19th century. His work has also been a starting point for many 20th century philosophers.|$|E
25|$|I {{believe in}} Norwich, my Alma Mater, because within her halls {{throughout}} the years these tenets have found expression while men have been taught to be loyal to duly constituted authority in thought and word and deed; to view suffrage as a sacred privilege to be exercised only {{in accordance with the}} <b>dictates</b> <b>of</b> conscience; to regard public office as a public trust; and finally to fight, and if need be to die, in defense of the cherished institutions of America.|$|E
25|$|After Tzipi Livni won the {{leadership}} election, Olmert officially resigned but remained prime minister, {{according to the}} <b>dictates</b> <b>of</b> the law. Even after an official resignation, he remains in power until a new prime minister is sworn in, {{in order to prevent}} a government void. Livni tried unsuccessfully to form a new coalition government. After Livni announced she could not form the new government, new parliamentary elections were set for 10 February 2009, and Olmert remained in power until after the elections, just as the law dictates.|$|E

25|$|The {{style of}} his sacred music varies from simple homophony, {{designed}} for absolute clarity of textual expression in conformance with the <b>dictates</b> <b>of</b> the Council of Trent (as Mantua was {{a center of}} the Counter-Reformation, {{this was to be}} expected), to motet settings similar in expressive intensity to his madrigals including passages of surprising chromaticism not unlike that of Gesualdo. This is particularly true in the 1581 collections: Ascendente Jesu, for example, contains colorful examples of text-painting such as he used in the works he was composing for the Ferrarese court at the time.|$|E
25|$|Every Polish-Lithuanian {{election}} Sejm was {{preceded by}} a convocation Sejm. In accordance with the <b>dictates</b> <b>of</b> the law, the Primate of Poland, Jan Wężyk, acting as Interrex, summoned a convocation sejm for June 22, 1632, which lasted through August 17. Krzysztof Radziwiłł was selected as Marshal of the Sejm. Non-Catholics, led by Marshal Radziwiłł and the magnate Bogusław Leszczyński, demanded increased rights; they were opposed by Voivode Tomasz Zamoyski and the future Bishop Aleksander Trzebiński, but managed to gather enough support that this question dominated the ensuing election sejm.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the work}} of Nobel Prize-winning {{economist}} and expert on famines Amartya Sen, most famines do not result only from lower food production, but also from an inappropriate or inefficient distribution of the food, often compounded by lack of information and indeed misinformation as to the extent of the problem. In the case of these Chinese famines, the urban population (under the <b>dictates</b> <b>of</b> Maoism) had protected legal rights for certain amounts of grain consumption, whereas the rural peasantry were given no such rights and were subject to non-negotiable production quotas, the surplus of which they were to survive on.|$|E

25|$|The {{house where}} Armstrong lived for almost 28 years was {{declared}} a National Historic Landmark in 1977 {{and is now}} a museum. The Louis Armstrong House Museum, at 34-56 107th Street (between 34th and 37th Avenues) in Corona, Queens, presents concerts and educational programs, operates as a historic house museum and makes materials in its archives of writings, books, recordings and memorabilia available to the public for research. The museum is operated by the City University of New York's Queens College, following the <b>dictates</b> <b>of</b> Lucille Armstrong's will. The museum opened to the public on October 15, 2003.

25|$|French arms at Heidelberg, Rosas, Huy, Landen, Charleroi and Marsaglia had {{achieved}} considerable battlefield success, {{but with the}} severe hardships of 1693 continuing through to the summer of 1694 France was unable to expend {{the same level of}} energy and finance for the forthcoming campaign. The crisis reshaped French strategy, forcing commanders to redraft plans to fit the <b>dictates</b> <b>of</b> fiscal shortfalls. In the background Louis XIV's agents were working hard diplomatically to unhinge the coalition but the Emperor, who had secured with the Allies his 'rights' to the Spanish succession should Charles II die during the conflict, did not desire a peace that would not prove personally advantageous. The Grand Alliance would not come apart as long as there was money available and a belief that the growing strength of their armies would soon be much greater than those of France.|$|E
25|$|Maidens sing a delicate, sentimental song ("On {{the blue}} Vistula") to {{entertain}} Marina as her chambermaid dresses her hair. Marina declares her preference for heroic songs of chivalry. She dismisses everyone. Alone, she sings of her boredom ("How tediously and sluggishly"), of Dmitriy, {{and of her}} thirst for adventure, power, and glory. The Jesuit Rangoni enters, bemoans the wretched state of the church, attempts to obtain Marina's promise that when she becomes Tsaritsa she will convert the heretics of Moscow (Russian Orthodox Church) to the true faith (Roman Catholicism), and encourages her to bewitch the Pretender. When Marina wonders why she should do this, Rangoni angrily insists that she stop short of nothing, including sacrificing her honor, to obey the <b>dictates</b> <b>of</b> the church. Marina expresses contempt of his hypocritical insinuations and demands he leave. As Rangoni ominously tells her {{she is in the}} thrall of infernal forces, Marina collapses in dread. Rangoni demands her obedience.|$|E
