40|$|Abstract: Reducing poverty through {{equitable}} {{and sustainable}} community-based natural resource management, particularly through programmes that accord {{attention to the}} issue of social inclusion, is the major objective of development projects related to natural resource management. At the local level, many innovations have been developed and are being put in place to enhance the pro-poor approaches, which specifically focus on the issues of livelihoods and inclusion. Livelihood Improvement Process (LIP) is one of the innovations arising to address this end. This paper presents the concept, process of implementation, and impacts of the LIP, as well as the opportunities and challenges it faces based on the experiences gained in Kabhrepalanchok and Sindhupalchok districts of Nepal. It concludes that the LIP can be an appropriate tool for reaching the poor, as it helps to sensitise and inform all actors about the need of pro-poor and inclusive development process.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the wood of ten clones: seven of Eucalyptus grandis and three of Eucalyptus saligna: both directed to charcoal production. Also, it was looked for to select clones with highercapacity {{for the establishment of a}} <b>forestry</b> <b>improvement</b> program. During the assessment it was considered the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the charcoal. According to the results it was verified that there exists a large variation among the assessed clones, which is higher in Eucalyptus grandis. The production of dry mass, associated to the estimation of mass of both lignin and charcoal proportionate a classification of the clones considered as the superior (clones number five, six and two), median (clones number ten, three, one and eight) and inferior (clones number nine, four and seven). Clone seven was the worsen for the charcoal production due to its low growth rate. The classification of the clones based on both the wood chemical characteristics and charcoal yield was not satisfactory. The growth rate was fundamental for the clones classification, being recommendable to incorporate it in future assessment of wood quality.

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The {{response}} of Canada milkvetch (Astragalus canadensis var. mortonii) to range and forest improvement practices was studied {{on a stand}} of mixed-coniferous forest which was clear -cut and burned in 1963 and 1964, respectively. The field studies were conducted on the Hall Ranch of the Eastern Oregon Experiment Station during the summers of 1968, 1969, and 1970. Canada milkvetch, which was virtually absent {{at the time of}} treatment, {{became one of the most}} important herbaceous species. The cover, frequency, and density of this species rapidly increased from 1965 to 1967; thereafter, these parameters have decreased, even to the levels of 1965 in some cases. The influence of forest canopy and physical site factor s, viz., soil moisture, soil temperature, and hydrogen ion concentration of the soil were studied. Phenology of seedling, root systems, shoot and flower development, seed production and germination were investigated. Studies were also made on the effects of grazing as they influence flowering, plant height, yield and number s of plants. The population parameters which were studied included cover, frequency, and density. The effects of calcium, copper, and cobalt each alone and in all combinations were studied by growing plants in the greenhouse. In addition, nitrogen fixation and the effect of nitrogen upon root nodulation were examined. The environmental parameters that influence Canada milkvetch are soil moisture and temperature for root nodulation and soil moisture for pod ripening. Soil from areas dominated by Canada milkvetch has higher pH values than soils in the forest and lower values than soils dominated by introduced grass species. In the experimental area, the amount of organic materials on the soil can be correlated with the intensity of grazing. Canada milkvetch begins growth shortly after snow melts, flowers in late June and July, and pods ripen in August. Flowering may begin in early June and continue to September, but the ovaries of the flowers produced early or late abort, because pollination occur s only when a medium sized bumble bee (Bombus sp.) is the most active. This is the only species which trips the flowers of Canada milkvetch. The greatest amount of damage to the reproductive potential of Canada milkvetch is done by a weevil (Apion sp.) which lives within the developing pod. At least 50 percent of the pods were destroyed by this insect during the summers of 1968 and 1969. Untreated seeds germinate and produce seedlings at the rate of approximately five percent per month. The rate of germination can be greatly increased by moist heat, but the amount of hard seeds remaining decreases and the amount decayed seed increases. The effects of grazing on this species can be evaluated by plant height, dry weight yield per plant, total yield per unit area, and the number of blossoms per flower stalk. Cattle prefer the inflorescences, but graze the leaves and stems along with the associated species at approximately the same intensity of use. On the other hand, big cattle preferentially graze this species from the time it begins growth in early spring until the animals leave the area. Canada milkvetch was always more productive under a grazing regime of cattle only than under a regime of domestic plus wild animals. Because the vegetation of the experimental area is rather low in the successional hierarchy, rapid changes in the values of cover, frequency, and density have occurred. The importance of Canada milkvetch has steadily decreased since 1967 and the relative importance of grasses has increased. Calcium seems to be required for nutrition and nodulation rather than as an amendment to alter the pH of the soil. Low levels of copper and cobalt also increase growth. Further research is required to adequately define the effects of these elements alone and in combination. Perhaps the successional role of Canada milkvetch can be prolonged by adequate fertility. This research provides an example demonstrating that range and <b>forestry</b> <b>improvement</b> must be coordinated and management intensified in order to maximize the biological potential of a given area...|$|E

We also established a reference library of RAPD fingerprints for 96 clones, which {{will serve as a}} reference source in cases of litigation concerning clone identity. The RAPD technique was also used to study the genetic relationship between nine European provenances of Norway spruce. A dendogram was obtained by individual pairwise comparison of 42 RAPD bands, which separated the nine provenances into two major groups, one containing the Nordic provenances (Sweden and Bielorussia) and another the Alpine provenances (France, Austria, Germany and Belgium). The Belgian provenance, which is not indigenous, is most closely related to the German provenance.

The fields of activity of the Society that have been more thoroughly researched are animal husbandry andbreeding, <b>forestry,</b> land <b>improvement,</b> 19 th century peasant reforms, and cartography. A number of articles and research papers on the various fields of activity of the Society have been published. At the same time, collections still retain quite a few archival documents that have not thus far engaged the attention of any researcher. Working through the Society’s correspondence systematicallyand thoroughly would probably take years but even a briefacquaintance with the fund documents proves to show that the material is versatile. The Society was a place where people turned to with a range of problems to receive advice, aid, and support. Thus, the surviving correspondence offers illimitable opportunities for finding material pertaining to individual questions from various walks of life, be they attempts of fertilizing fields with guano, new roofing materials, insuring animals or people, organising agricultural education, constructing waterways, and a thousand subjects more. There are subjects that are constantly present, e. g., construction of waterways or insurance issues. Some questions are discussed only once or twice, e. g. using wild chestnuts for feed, eye problems of the peasants, etc. The Society’s files from 1914 – 1918 are also interesting andwould certainly offer more detailed information on, for example, the everyday life in Tartu during WW I. The plans and drawings in the files possess an individual value. In addition to the numerous plans on constructing waterways and channels, one is able to view the plan of the Tartu postal station and its location, and different example plans of domestic buildings. The archive of the Society is rich in publications.

40|$|Since the {{transition}} to a market economy in 1990, Mongolia has experienced drastic socio-economic changes, leading to an increase in poverty and unemployment, and a social stratification within Mongolian society with disparities between rural and urban areas. The current situation puts increasing anthropogenic pressure on natural resources, seriously affecting the forests of northern Mongolia. The effective management of resources, together with the establishment of sustainable planning strategies, are being hindered by the decentralization and erosion of forest administration. In addition political deficits, insufficient educational methods and outdated forest management have resulted in a lack of up-to-date thematic maps, and unreliable statistics on forest resources. Besides institutional reforms in the <b>forestry</b> sector, and <b>improvements</b> in education, urgent strategic measures must be taken to secure the standardization and quality of forestry procedures. This thesis describes the scope for using GIS-supported methods to produce a qualitative and quantitative survey of forest resources in Mongolia, based on multitemporal satellite imagery. The methodology was practiced in selected areas of the east and west buffer zone of the Khan Khentii Special Protected Area in cooperation with the GTZ, the National University of Mongolia (NUM) and the former Forest Management Centre (FMPC) in Ulaanbaatar, as part of an educational scheme for training local experts. The objective was to investigate, quantify, classify and monitor existing forest resources using multitemporal satellite imagery, with an emphasis on technical support and capacity building in the fields of GIS and remote sensing. The work procedures thus developed are presented as a basis for creating a consistent data bank to support the functional planning of forest resources and nature conservation, and boost management capacity on all administrative levels...|$|R

It may not survive without effective {{management and the}} implementation of an effective engineering system. In this study the Khajeh pistachio forest of Karat e Nadir in the township of Khorasan Razavi was selected for its unique condition and management history. Sampling was done to compile estimates for percentage vegetation cover and density. Samples were taken from transects of 300 m in length in a northerly direction to compile a net inventory for diameter of cover (d. o. c) for trees of more than 2 m in height. Samples were taken from an area of 1000 m 2. Present roads and suggested roads with density of cover by ArcGIS 9. 3 were mapped. Characteristics of woody species with d. o. c less than 2 m were measured and documented from the samples. Forest zones were identified and descriptions of the forest were made. Economic patronage was established for local inhabitants {{in the study area}} to incorporate aspects of social <b>forestry,</b> reclamation and <b>improvement</b> of rangeland and forest development to promote an understanding of its value for society. Roads existing in the year 1375 (solar year) were evaluated according to statistics for density, cover percent, average production of pistachio and compared with those after continuous management, implementation of an engineering system and road development in the year 1390. Results of One-Sample T and One-Sample Z by Minitab 16 software showed non-significant difference in 15 years. With regards to roads, there was a 9. 5 km increase from recent fires and climate change; forest cover recorded 11. 1 % growth after 15 years of the plan caused growth of 0. 8 % demonstrating appropriate forest management.

40|$|Hybrid {{physiological}} {{models are}} being increasingly {{used to assess}} productivity, carbon sequestration, water and nutrient use and environmental impacts of management decisions. Users include forest managers, politicians, environmental agencies and scientists. However a wider use of these models has been prevented {{as a result of}} an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms regulating carbon allocation, nutrient availability in soils and nutrient uptake by trees. On-going innovation in clonal <b>forestry,</b> genetic <b>improvement</b> and vegetation management techniques is also poorly represented in hybrid models. This thesis examines means to represent nutrition and genotype-nutrition interactions in productivity physiological hybrid models. Nutrient limitations and growth differences between genotypes were hypothesized to operate through key physiological processes: photosynthesis, carbon allocation and nutrient internal cycling. In order to accomplish the aims of the study both greenhouse and field experimentation were carried out. In a first experiment, responses of photosynthesis (A) to intercellular CO₂ concentration (Ci) were measured in a fast- and a slow-growing clone of Pinus radiata D. Don cultivated in a greenhouse in a factorial combination of nitrogen and phosphorus supply, and analyzed using the biochemical model of leaf photosynthesis described by Farquhar et al. (1980). There were significant positive linear relationships between the parameters, Vcmax, Jmax, Tp and both foliar nitrogen (Na) and phosphorus (Pa) concentration on an area basis. The study showed that the effects of nitrogen and phosphorus supply on photosynthesis were statistically independent and that the photosynthetic behaviour of the two clones was equivalent. In a similar study, gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence were simultaneously measured to determine internal transfer conductance (gm) based on the "constant J method". Transfer conductance may pose significant limitations to photosynthesis which may be differentially affected by nutrition and genotype in Pinus radiata. Values of gm were similar to those of stomatal conductance (gs) and their ratio (gm / gs) was not influenced by nutrient supply or clone being on average (± 1 SE) 1. 22 ± 0. 04. Relative mesophyll limitations (LM, 16 %) to photosynthesis were marginally greater than those imposed by stomata (LS, 13 %), and together smaller than the relative limitations posed to photosynthesis by biochemical processes (LB, 71 %). The CO₂ concentration in the intercellular air spaces (Ci) was (± 1 SE) 53 ± 3 µmol mol- 1 lower than in the atmosphere (Ca) while CO₂ concentration in the chloroplasts (Cc) was (± 1 SE) 48 ± 2 µmol mol- 1 less than Ci. Values of LS, LM and LB and CO₂ diffusion gradients posed by gs (Ca-Ci) and gm (Ci-Cc) did not change with nutrient supply or clone. In a third experiment, one-year old Pinus radiata cuttings from four genotypes were cultivated in silica sand with a factorial combination of nitrogen (N 0 = 1. 43 and N 1 = 7. 14 mM) and phosphorus (P 0 = 0. 084 and P 1 = 0. 420 mM) supply for 24 months. N supply was enriched with ¹⁵N to 2. 5 ⁰/₀₀ (labelled N) during the first year, then plants transferred to clean sand and cultivated for another year with ¹⁵N at levels close to natural abundance (0. 3664899 atom percent ¹⁵N, δ¹⁵N 0. 5115 ⁰/₀₀) provided by the source of N in nutrient solution applied during the second year. Recovery of labelled and unlabelled N was used to estimate N remobilization. N remobilization scaled with plant growth, N content and N and P supply. In relative terms, 65 % of all stored N was remobilized in the high-nutrient supply regime compared to 42 - 48 % at lower N and P addition rates. Most N remobilization occurred during spring-summer (77 %), coincidently with the largest proportion of needle development (80 %), indicating that N remobilization was driven by sink-strength. Foliage was by far the main source for internal cycling while roots were the main sink (40 %). Clones exhibited differences in N remobilization capacity, but these differences were completely explained by the size of the N pool before remobilization took place, indicating that N remobilization performance was similar among clones. In a fourth study, four clones were cultivated in silica sand with a factorial combination of nitrogen and phosphorus supply for ten months, and patterns of carbon allocation examined using a carbon balance approach. Gross-primary productivity (GPP) scaled mainly with nitrogen but also with phosphorus supply. The fraction of GPP (GPP = ANPP + APR + TBCA) allocated to above-ground components (ANPP) increased with N and P supply at the expense of total-below ground C allocation (TBCA) with no apparent effect on the fraction of GPP partitioned to above-ground plant respiration (APR). Carbon use efficiency (NPP:GPP) scaled with nutrient supply, being 0. 42 in the low-nutrient supply regime compared to 0. 51 in the high-nutrient supply regime, suggesting that in poor fertility environments a larger proportion of the C budget is respired compared to the net productivity. Fast-growing clones allocated about 2 - 4 % more carbon to above-ground components (ANPP) at the expense of carbon allocated below-ground (TBCA) with no effect on carbon respired above-ground (APR), indicating that faster-growing genotypes allocate more carbon to leaf area which may compound and increase overall GPP over time. The field component of this thesis was conducted in a subset of locations where ENSIS (formerly New Zealand Forest Research Institute) had established trials to test the influence of species, soil disturbance and plant nutrition on sustainability indicators. Plots were small in size (3 m × 3 m) with trees spaced at 0. 5 m × 0. 5 m (40 000 trees ha- 1) with nine measurement trees surrounded by a two-row buffer. All sites were planted in winter 2001 and harvested in spring 2005. The aim of this pilot study was to examine patterns of carbon allocation during the fourth year after planting in control and fertilized mini-plots of Pinus radiata in five sites with contrasting climate and soil conditions in the South Island of New Zealand. The study showed that the fraction of gross-primary productivity allocated belowground increased as the soil C:N ratio increased. However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to the unusual nature of the trial and the reduced number of sites studied. Two existing physiological models were selected for the discussion in this thesis (3 -PG, Landsberg and Waring 1997; canopy net carbon exchange model, Whitehead et al. 2002). Potential improvements for the nutritional component of 3 -PG comprise: accounting for reductions in carbon use efficiency (NPP:GPP) in poor-fertility environments, adding a preliminary fertility modifier (FN, 0 - 1) driven by soil C : N ratio and soil N, adding a preliminary relationship between carbon allocation to roots and the soil C : N ratio and representing faster-growing genotypes by increasing their leaf area but not their photosynthetic performance. The canopy net carbon exchange model (NCE) combines the coupled model of leaf photosynthesis - stomatal conductance described by Leuning (1995) with canopy structure and a water balance model to scale carbon assimilation from leaves to canopies. Potential improvements to account for nutrient deficiencies in the leaf model by Leuning (1995), comprise using nutrient ratios to discriminate nitrogen (Na/Pa 23 mol mol- 1), adding relationships between photosynthetic model parameters Vcmax and Jmax to Pa, and correcting the estimation of photosynthetic parameters Vcmax and Jmax by accounting for transfer conductance (gm). The canopy net carbon exchange model may be also modified to account for carbon-use efficiency, carbon allocation to roots and genotype in a similar form to that proposed for 3 -PG. The results previously outlined provide a preliminary framework to represent tree and soil nutrition in physiological hybrid productivity models...|$|R

Decentralizacija planiranja i odlučivanja ključne su za unapređenje poslovanja šumarije radi prilagodbe ciljevima modernog multifunkcionalnog šumarstva, koji sve više postaje mjera društveno odgovornog gospodarenja šumama. Svako unapređenje poslovanja šu marije mora polaziti od njezinog mjesta i pozicije os nov ne jedinice pos lov nog sustava u kojoj se obavljaju osnovne javne i komercijalne djelatnosti sektora šumarstva, a za ocjenu mogućih doprinosa u unapređenju pojedine funkcije uprav ljanja valja sagledavati najbolju praksu nje zine realizacije u usporedivim djelatnostima, a samo unapređenje mora se podjednako odnositi na gospodarsko djelovanje šumarije, ali i na javno edukativnu funkciju šumarije u okruženju. The {{analysis}} of business operation of forestry office, {{as the basic}} and fundamental organization unit in the Republic of Croatia, was done {{on the model of}} Ludbreg forestry office that lies within Forestry Head Office, Koprivnica Branch. In the process of analysis, the forestry office was presented through the survey of its complete organizational structure as well as its business operation and legislative regulations of Croatian forestry. In the research all the functions of forestry were analysed, such as productivity function, the function of protection and preservation of forests as well as the function of public education. The following methods were applied in the process of analysing ana evaluating: - SWOT analysis Based on SWOT analysis results, the fundamental strength lies within the qualified and motivated human resources supported by stable financing. Most of the factors of weaknesses within are the result of and are connnected to higher-ranked organizational system containing oversized hierarchy of decision making - There are possibilities to decrease the existing suborganizations of the main managing functions without destroying the basic principles of the organization and bussines protocols, as well as the possibility of developing new operations together with strengthening the public role of Forestry. - Poll Poll was made on the sample of 50 respondents from the various institutions, organizations or societies in the local area, such as local government, eductional institutions, and citizen´s associations. It included respondents selected by gender, degree of education and the fact whether they owned the private forests or not. The aim of the poll was to establish the role of forester´s work in the local area. The result of the poll showed that there is a serious interest in the well beeing and prosperity of the forests and environment among the public. The role and importance of the forester is regarded by the public quite high and this profession is considered to be important, ranked immediately after a doctor and a teacher, and before a vet and a lawyer. A full confidence regarding the management of forests is given to forestry profession. - Analysis of basic management functions Planning - within the sphere of planning it is suggested to include forestries into the decission making on the strategic level through the possibilities of widening the range of activities (ore and mineral resources, drinking water, plantations, transplanting and similar activities). It can be achieved by including forestry personnel into the working groups, ad hoc groups or teams especially when the development and application of local norms is the issue. Organization - an approach to organize forestries into the profit centres with liberal organization scheme is suggested, as well as more modern forms of organization (project organization, Free Form Design). Managing the human resources - to define and enable for the qualified personnel the conditions of professional development and improvement applying the principle of permanent and whole life education. Leadership - team effort should be emphasized, supported and followed by stimulating bonuses as a reward. Control - the function of natural and financial control should be implemented by means of correct and timely system of information applying the systems and norms of quality control (such as ISO standard). On the basis of these researches and analysis the following general conclusions in connection with the <b>improvement</b> of <b>forestry</b> office business operation, were drawn: 1. the <b>improvement</b> of <b>forestry</b> office business operation is welcome, necessary, and inevitable in the light of further development of management functions within the frame of contemporary management concepts as well as constantly changable circumstances of business operation and conditions of environment and millieu; 2. business operation improvement is of the utmost importance as the operative support in the forthcoming restructuring of the firm; 3. business operation improvement must be supported by human resources whose qualifications, further stimulated by organizational and motivational means, play the crucial role in the forthcoming breakthrough; 4. the improvement of business operation mostly entails transformation of the managing functions in order to achieve better adjustment to the targets of modern multifunctional forestry as stated in the conditions of approved FSC certificate, which tends to be the mode of socially responsible forestry managing; as well as it entails the adjustment ond acquirement of the quality control norms (ISO 9000 : 2001; ISO 14000); 5. each <b>improvement</b> of <b>forestry</b> office business operation should proceed from location and position of the basic unit within the business operating system where the basic public and commercial activities of forestry department have been performed; 6. evaluation of possible contributions in the improvement of each and every management function should comprise the best examples of its realization in everyday practice within the comparative fields of activities constantly bearing in mind Croatian orientation for the concept of integral and multipurpose managing of forests and <b>forestry</b> resources; 7. <b>improvement</b> of business operation must equally refer to the commercial as pect of forestry office operation, as well as to its public educational func tion within the given environment so that it can motivate and inform this public about the importance of protection and preservation of forests in order to win it over and convince it that it is essential to have expert and res ponsible forestry management by competent forestry science and practice...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{deterioration}} {{has expanded}} from local environmental pollution to global environmental disruption with economic modern industrialization and globalization. We {{have to break}} the link between economic activity and environmental deterioration, and have to preserve the ecosystem. The purpose of this thesis is to consider a framework of macro environmental accounting that can provide an environmental indicator by which the sustainability of economic society can be evaluated appropriately. Environmental accounting is applied {{as a tool for}} analyzing the correlation between economical activities and their environmental impacts. The theoretical framework is classified roughly into two basic accounting approaches. One is a macro environmental accounting based on SNA, which is accounting at a national level. The other is a form of micro environmental accounting based on corporate accounts. The former describes productive activities and consumption activities comprehensively, and the latter places emphasis on productive activities. Up to the present, indicators of economic growth have been measures of total value-added, such as GDP. However, conventional indicators regard activities which have negative impacts on environments and human welfare as positive contributions to growth. Attempts were made to construct indicators which deduct from the measure of growth that portion of value-added that results in declines in human welfare. This is the so-called study of Green GDP. However, it is doubtful whether Green GDP is a comprehensive indicator that takes environmental preservation into account. It is because Green GDP is shown as monetary information. Environment is not evaluated in a market. For this reason, when economic growth is larger than the reduction of environmental impacts, an indicator has the problem that a upgrowth is shown. So, the theoretical framework of macro environmental accounting is applied to a regional economies, agriculture and forestry, and this thesis aims to construct an indicator which evaluates sustainability, and to construct a theoretical framework for macro environmental accounting. Chapter I describes the background of this thesis, its purpose and states an analytic problem. In Chapter II, environmental accounting is defined as a process that is communicated to stakeholders with the correlation between the economy and the environment, which is quantitatively measured as a physical and/or monetary term. And, the purpose of environmental accounting is to provide a correlation between the economy and the environment so as to improve the environmental preservation function of the accounting unit and its stakeholders. Moreover, methods of environmental accounting are categorized based on their accounting unit and their environment information. In addition, two theoretical frameworks of macro environmental accounting are described; one is the System for integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting (shortened to SEEA), and the other is a hybrid environmental accounting, which integrates monetary accounts and the physical accounts. In Chapter III, three macro environmental accountings which applied the SEEA framework were estimated. One is a macro environmental accounting for the economy of Hokkaido Prefecture. The second is a waste account for the waste-treatment activities in Hokkaido Prefecture. The third is a macro environmental accounting for agriculture and forestry throughout Japan. As a result, {{it became clear that the}} cost effectiveness of environmental activity in Hokkaido is lower than the national average. This suggests that reduction of environmental impacts is not performed at suitable costs. And, it became clear that countermeasures against local environmental problems such as air pollution and water pollution, improves with the eco-efficiency indicators and the decoupling indicators. However, it became clear that the countermeasures against global environmental problems are lagging and that the environmental impact of consumption activities is large. Moreover, the waste-treatment activities in Hokkaido to improve the performance of reuse and recycling of waste products, and realize a reduction in the amount of final disposals was shown as an estimation result of the waste account of Hokkaido. However, because emission of air pollutants and greenhouse gases resulting from waste-treatment activities were increasing, it became clear that eco-efficiency is falling. From these results, it was shown that it is insufficient to decouple growth of the economy from environmental impacts. Next, it became clear from the estimation result of an agricultural waste account that reduction of water pollution is realized by appropriate disposal and circulation of livestock feces and urine. However, emission of greenhouse gases by disposal and recycle activities increased, and it became clear that the environmental problem has been shifted. In Chapter IV, it became clear from the estimation result of the agriculture and forestry SEEA which extended the production boundary of SNA and evaluated the environmental benefit of agriculture and forestry that agriculture and forestry offset their environmental impact by the environmental benefit, returned the excessive benefit to society, and the external economy effect has occurred. Where, it is necessary to improve about air pollution. As mentioned above, it became clear that the environmental benefit to society can be increased by reducing the environmental impacts of the productive activity of agriculture and forestry. In Chapter V, the ecological footprint (shortened to EF), based on the concept of ecological economics was introduced into the macro environmental accounting as an indicator. EF recognizes an environmental physical limitation, is understanding the physical use state of the environment by an economic activity, and can evaluate the strong sustainability. And it became clear from the estimation result of the hybrid environmental accounting which introduced the physical account and EF for Hokkaido prefecture that the Hokkaido economy is in an ecological deficit to an environmental carrying capacity. However, because EF was decreasing, it was also shown that the Hokkaido economy is progressing in the sustainable way. Moreover, in Hokkaido, the improvement of eco-efficiency is found on local environmental aspects, such as air pollution and water pollution. However, in emission of greenhouse gas, and energy consumption and a land use, it was shown that eco-efficiency is low and the decoupling has not been realized. On the other hand, from the estimation result of the hybrid environmental accounting for the agriculture and forestry of Hokkaido, it was determined that it was possible to decrease EF of a local society by the environmental benefit of agriculture and forestry. However, it became clear with decoupling indicators that productive activities of agriculture and <b>forestry</b> need the <b>improvement</b> of eco-efficiency. From the result of the above empirical study, it is desirable to apply EF as a comprehensive environmental indicator to clarify the sustainability of economic activities. And it became clear that eco-efficiency indicators and decoupling indicators are useful as indicators which drive the sustainability of economic activities. On the other hand, the Green GDP based on environmental monetary valuations is useful as environmental-costs indicators, such as environmental expenditures. And, the hybrid framework which introduced the physical-environment account which clarifies the use state of the environment by the economy for environmental carrying capacity as a framework of a macro environmental accounting is useful. That is, environmental-improvement indicators and sustainability indicators can be derived by introducing EF into the framework of the hybrid environmental accounting which integrated a monetary account and physical environmental accounts. Therefore, it was identified that the information about the environmental pressure for environmental carrying capacity and the information about the performance of economic activities can be provided using these easy indicators. And the framework of a macro environmental accounting can be improved by introducing a material flow account. This improvement enables finding of a shift of environmental problems, and evaluation of the eco-efficiency of resource circulation activities...|$|R
