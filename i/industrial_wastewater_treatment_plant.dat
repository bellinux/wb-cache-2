5000|$|Treatment Waste: Treatment waste {{consists}} of sludge, byproducts, coproducts, or metal scraps {{resulting from a}} facility or plant. Sludge is any solid, semisolid, or liquid waste generated from a municipal, commercial, or <b>industrial</b> <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plant,</b> water supply treatment plant, or air pollution control facility exclusive of the treated effluent from a wastewater treatment plant. This includes electric arc furnace dust and baghouse dusts. A byproduct is a material {{that is not a}} primary product which is not solely or separately produced in a production process whereas coproducts are intentionally produced. Byproducts need further processing to be useful whereas coproducts are highly processed and can be sold as a commodity without further processing. Examples of byproducts include slag, fly ash, heavy ends, distillation column bottoms, etc. and coproducts include metals such as lead produced during the copper refining process. Scrap metal wastes include sheet metal, wire, metal tanks and containers, scrap automobiles, and machine shop turnings that are generally nonhazardous in nature.|$|E

50|$|A {{non-profit}} {{research and}} testing organization, the Instrumentation Testing Association (ITA) can provide results of field testing online TOC analyzers {{in an industrial}} wastewater application. Gulf Coast Waste Disposal Authority (GCWDA), Bayport <b>Industrial</b> <b>Wastewater</b> <b>Treatment</b> <b>Plant</b> in Pasadena, Texas sponsored and conducted this test in 2011. The GCWDA Bayport facility treats approximately 30 mgd of industrial waste received from approximately 65 customers (primarily petrochemical). Field tests consisted of operating online TOC analyzers at the influent of the Bayport facility in which TOC concentrations can range from 490 to 1020 mg/L {{with an average of}} 870 mg/L. GCWDA conducts approximately 102 TOC analyses in their laboratory per day at their Bayport treatment facility and use TOC measurements for process control and billing purposes. GCWDA plans to use online TOC analyzers for process control, detecting influent slug loads from industries and to potentially use online TOC analyzers to detect and monitor volatiles of the incoming stream. Field tests were conducted for a period of 90-days and used laboratory conformance measurements once per day to compare with analyzer output to demonstrate the instrument's overall accuracy when subjected to many simultaneously changing parameters as experienced in real-time monitoring conditions. Field test results can provide information regarding instrument design, operation and maintenance requirements which influence the performance of the instruments in field applications. The field test report includes evaluations of online TOC analyzers utilizing the following technologies: High Temperature Combustion (HTC), High Temperature Catalytic/Combustion Oxidation (HTCO), Supercritical Water Oxidation (SCWO), and Two-Stage Advanced Oxidation (TSAO).|$|E

40|$|Chemical and {{petrochemical}} wastewaters {{contain a}} host of contaminants whose removal necessitates different treatment strategies. Indeed, regulations concerning the final discharge from <b>industrial</b> <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> (WWTPs) have set more and more stringent limits as regards macro- and micropollutant content in recent decades, meaning that many WWTPs {{have had to be}} upgraded. In particular, this article discusses the WWTP for the petrochemical site at Porto Marghera, Italy, which has recently undergone modification following these legislative changes. Due to the strict legal limits governing macropollutants and micropollutants, and conditioned by the lack of space necessary for a full-scale plant overhaul, the existing activated sludge tank was converted into a membrane biological reactor. The paper presents experimental data collected during a five-month investigation showing the removal rates achieved by the upgraded plant for macropollutants (in particular nitrogen compounds) as well micropollutants (heavy metals, organic and inorganic dangerous compounds).

30|$|Biocides are {{materials}} and substances {{that are used}} {{for the purpose of}} feed pretreatment and are categorized as oxidizing and non-oxidizing biocides.

On the other hand, non-oxidizing agents are more relevant to <b>industrial</b> <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> since they are more compatible with RO membranes.
