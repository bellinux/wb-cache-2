25|$|During the 1840s, the <b>felt</b> <b>hat</b> {{industry}} {{went into}} depression; the recession affected Denton, with wages {{in the area}} falling by 35% and only 12 hat manufacturers remaining in Denton. The depression was partially due to changes in fashion away from felt towards silk hats. The revitalisation of the <b>felt</b> <b>hat</b> industry came in the 1850s, once again on a whim of fashion but also {{the increased use of}} machinery led to reduced production costs. The resurgence was demonstrated by the doubling of the number of hat manufacturers in the town between 1861 and 1872. At its peak in the Edwardian period, Denton's <b>felt</b> <b>hat</b> industry was the largest <b>felt</b> <b>hat</b> manufacturing centre in Britain. There were 36 firms directly involved in the <b>felt</b> <b>hat</b> making industry. In 1907 the majority of the 16,428,000 felt hats made in England (worth £2,068,000) were made in Denton and Stockport. In 1921, the working population of Denton was 9,653 with about 41% of those people in occupations related to the hatting industry. The last hat factory in Denton closed in 1980.|$|E
25|$|Upon leaving Richmond Central State School, {{and after}} short spells in a sawmill and a boot factory, Tudor entered the <b>felt</b> <b>hat</b> industry. Tudor apprenticed in Abbotsford and then {{travelled}} across Victoria {{in the hat}} trade. Tudor went to England, working in London, Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester, marrying Alice Smale in Denton, Lancashire in 1894. Smale died the same year, but Tudor continued in the <b>felt</b> <b>hat</b> trade by moving to London and becoming vice-president of the local branch of the Felt Hatters' Union. In 1897 Tudor remarried to Fanny Jane Mead.|$|E
25|$|In the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries {{the town}} had a flourishing <b>felt</b> <b>hat</b> {{manufacturing}} industry, which was probably at its peak locally in the 1820s when {{a third of the}} town's population were involved in the industry in over 20 factories but by 1892 there was only one manufacturer still in production in the town.|$|E

25|$|Hard <b>felt</b> <b>hats</b> {{are made}} by {{specialised}} craftsmen in workshops and are worn throughout the year. These hats are found centred on the Saxon regions around Sibiu and Bistrița {{and may have been}} introduced into Transylvania by the Saxons, whose craftsmen made them in workshops, from the 18th century. The style varies widely in shape and size of brim according to area. The wide brimmed hat appeared around the 17th-19th centuries and <b>felt</b> <b>hats</b> with broad brims up to 60cm were worn in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and continued to be worn in Bistrița Valley, Moldavia until the 1940s. Hats with 40cm brims were worn in central Transylvania and Muntenia. <b>Felt</b> <b>hats</b> with hard upturned brims – cu găng – were worn in Crișana, Hunedoara and Bukovina following a fashion of the gentry. Wide brimmed <b>felt</b> <b>hats</b> with a large peacock feather (roată de păun) are still worn in Năsăud, further south the hats are much reduced in size, shepherds in Sibiu and along the southern Carpathians wear <b>felt</b> <b>hats</b> with very small brims, the present day fashion tending {{to do away with the}} brim altogether.|$|R

25|$|Dacians {{were divided}} into two classes: the {{aristocracy}} (tarabostes) and the common people (comati). Only the aristocracy had the right to cover their heads, and wore a <b>felt</b> <b>hat.</b> The common people, who comprised the rank and file of the army, the peasants and artisans, might have been called capillati in Latin. Their appearance and clothing can be seen on Trajan's Column.|$|E
25|$|Through the 1570s, a {{soft fabric}} {{hat with a}} {{gathered}} crown was worn. These derived from the flat hat of the previous period, and over time the hat was stiffened and the crown became taller and far from flat. Later, a conical <b>felt</b> <b>hat</b> with a rounded crown called a capotain or copotain became fashionable. These became very tall {{toward the end of}} century. Hats were decorated with a jewel or feather, and were worn indoors and out.|$|E
25|$|Tudor {{was born}} in Melbourne to Welsh {{immigrant}} parents. He attended local state schools, but left {{at a young age}} to enter the workforce. He became involved in the <b>felt</b> <b>hat</b> industry, serving an apprenticeship at a large factory in Australia and then living for periods in England and the United States to better learn the trade. Tudor became involved in trade unionism in England, and after returning to Australia {{served as president of the}} Felt Hatters' Union. He was later elected to the Victorian Trades Hall Council, and in 1900 became president.|$|E

25|$|The first {{standard}} uniforms {{used by the}} National Guard was khaki colored, worn with long pants, with metal buttons running down the front and emblems of the neck. The shoes, leggings and equipment belts were all brown. A <b>felt</b> <b>hat</b> was worn until 1918, when it was changed to straw, which was worn until 1924. These hats were worn with the left wing brim bent upward which carryed a fabric Cockade in {{the colors of the}} Flag of El Salvador, the Cockade was changed to metal. The issued weapon was the 7mm Spanish Mauser rifle which was used until 1924. This dress was an early idea of Colonel Garrido.|$|E
25|$|Felt hatting was {{recorded}} in Denton as early as 1702 and Denton gained supremacy in the hatting industry {{towards the end of}} the 19th century. The increasing importance of Denton and Haughton as centres of <b>felt</b> <b>hat</b> production is demonstrated by the increase of manufacturers in the area: in 1800 there were 4 hatting firms in Denton and Haughton, but by 1825 there were 25 manufacturers, making it the third largest hat making centre in the north west. By 1840, 24,000 felt hats were produced in Denton a week. The prosperity of the hatting industry is reflected in the growth of the town from 2,501 in 1801 to 6,759 in 1841.|$|E
25|$|Although the <b>felt</b> <b>hat</b> {{industry}} in Denton and Haughton was prosperous and {{an integral part}} of the town, working conditions in the factories were not risk free. One of the problems workers faced was mercury poisoning; mercury was used to separate the fur from the rabbit hide and workers were in regular contact with fur impregnated with mercury or exposed to mercury vapour. Inadequate ventilation in some parts of the hat making process led to other sorts of dangers; solvents were also used and on 14 January 1901 there was an explosion at the factory of Joseph Wilson & Sons in Denton, killing 13 people and injuring many more. The explosion was of vapour from methylated spirits used in the dying process.|$|E

Due to cheap imports {{and a decline in}} the wearing of hats, the trade had largely died out by the 1970s with just three companies remaining, Denham & Hargrave Ltd, Vero & Everitt Ltd and Wilson & Stafford Ltd. The production of <b>felt</b> <b>hats</b> in the town ceased altogether with the closure of the Wilson & Stafford factory in 1999.|$|R

25|$|In 1780, what is {{traditionally}} {{considered to be}} the first hat shop in Danbury was established by Zadoc Benedict (although hat making existed in Danbury before the Revolution); it had three employees, and they made 18 hats weekly. By 1800, Danbury was producing 20,000 hats annually, more than any other city in the U.S. Due to the fur <b>felt</b> <b>hat</b> coming back into style for men and increasing mechanization in the 1850s, by 1859 hat production in Danbury had risen to 1.5 million annually. By 1887, thirty factories were producing 5 million hats per year. Around this time, fur processing was separated from hat manufacturing when the P. Robinson Fur Cutting Company (1884) on Oil Mill Road and the White Brothers' factory began operation.|$|E
25|$|The 28th Arkansas Infantry mustered by {{companies}} and conducted its initial training near Fort Smith, Arkansas, {{on what the}} locals called the Mazzard Prairie. Initially, the regiment was poorly equipped; however, they were eventually supplied with modern Springfield rifle-muskets that had been captured at the First Battle of Bull Run, Virginia, and transported west. The regiment gained a reputation {{as some of the}} most disciplined and martial looking then training on Mazzard Prairie. In the Spring of 1863 the men was issued standard Columbus Depot uniforms, generally made from light-grey jean material with an eight button single breasted frock coat having dark blue trim on its straight stand-up collar and straight cuffs. They also were issued one pair of matching trousers and a simple black <b>felt</b> <b>hat.</b> The regiment's commissioned officers were mostly men of means before to the war, and it is assumed they would have indulged themselves at the many commercial uniform outfitters. The 36th Arkansas's microfilm records include many Quartermaster receipts showing the officers purchased gold braid, coats, silk sashes, white cotton shirts, and large brimmed hats.|$|E
25|$|Many {{men went}} bareheaded and, {{apart from the}} Emperor, they were {{normally}} so in votive depictions, which may distort the record we have. In the late Byzantine period a number of extravagantly large hats were worn as uniform by officials. In the 12th century, Emperor Andronikos Komnenos wore a hat shaped like a pyramid, but eccentric dress {{is one of many}} things he was criticised for. This was perhaps related to the very elegant hat with a very high-domed peak, and a sharply turned-up brim coming far forward in an acute triangle to a sharp point (left), that was drawn by Italian artists when the Emperor John VIII Palaiologos went to Florence and the Council of Ferrara in 1438 in {{the last days of the}} Empire. Versions of this and other clothes, including many spectacular hats, worn by the visitors were carefully drawn by Pisanello and other artists. They passed through copies across Europe for use in Eastern subjects, especially for depictions of the three kings or Magi in Nativity scenes. In 1159 the visiting Crusader Prince Raynald of Châtillon wore a tiara shaped felt cap, embellished in gold. An Iberian wide brimmed <b>felt</b> <b>hat</b> came into vogue during the 12th century. Especially in the Balkans, small caps with or without fur brims were worn, of the sort later adopted by the Russian Tsars.|$|E

It was Frederick Jackson, who had organised his own expedition to Franz Josef Land after being rejected by Nansen, and had based his headquarters at Cape Flora on Northbrook Island, the southernmost island of the archipelago. Jackson's own account records that his first reaction to this sudden meeting was to assume the figure to be a shipwrecked sailor, perhaps from the expedition's supply ship Windward which was due to call that summer. As he approached, Jackson saw [...] "a tall man, wearing a soft <b>felt</b> <b>hat,</b> loosely made, voluminous clothes and long shaggy hair and beard, all reeking with black grease". After a moment's awkward hesitation, Jackson recognised his visitor: [...] "You are Nansen, aren't you?", and received the reply [...] "Yes, I am Nansen." ...|$|E

[...] He returned again on 20 June 1941, after the failure of Operation Battleaxe to relieve Tobruk, and determined to sack the Middle East commander, General Wavell. John Colville recorded Churchill's deliberations in his diary; [...] "spent the afternoon at Chartwell. After a long sleep the P.M. in a purple dressing gown and grey <b>felt</b> <b>hat</b> took me to see his goldfish. He was ruminating deeply about the fate of Tobruk and contemplating means of resuming the offensive". Churchill continued to pay occasional, short, visits to the house; on one such, on 24 June 1944, just after the Normandy landings, his secretary recorded that the house was [...] "shut up and rather desolate".|$|E

Alex Mcpherson called [...] "Ugly" [...] {{one of the}} strongest examples of 2016's R/country trend, praising how it [...] "captured the emotional blood and guts at the core of both genres". Mike Wass wrote that the song's hooks provided the potential for strong crossover appeal, and described it as an improvement over her single [...] "No Time for It" [...] (2016). Wass praised Fantasia's vocals as showcasing [...] "her sheer authenticity as a person/performer" [...] even when [...] "the lyrics veer dangerously close to schmaltz". Matthew Scott Donnelly wrote that [...] "Ugly" [...] was a surprising fit for the singer. In his full review of the album, Donnelly <b>felt</b> <b>hat</b> [...] "Ugly" [...] would appeal to fans of Miranda Lambert, commending her vocals and the instrumental as [...] "the product of total, unrelenting conviction". Sarah Grant called it [...] "one of the more evocative songs on the album".
