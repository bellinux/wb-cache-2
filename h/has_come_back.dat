25|$|Among {{the plot}} twists are {{the death of}} {{apparently}} crucial characters and the reappearances of believed-to-be dead characters. However, Rachael Brown of The Atlantic said that Martin's penchant for unpredictability may make the reader grow increasingly skeptical of apparent deaths, alluding to Jon Snow's fate in A Dance with Dragons. Martin believes that bringing back a dead character necessitates a transformative experience of the character. The body may be moving, but {{some aspect of the}} spirit is changed or lost. One of the characters who <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> repeatedly from death is Beric Dondarrion, The Lightning Lord, and what has happened with him echoes with some of the other revived characters; bits of his humanity and his past lives are lost every time he comes back from death, his flesh is falling away from him, but he remembers the mission he was sent to do before death.|$|E
25|$|The Bulls and the Miami Heat rivalry began {{once the}} Heat became contenders during the 1990s, a decade {{dominated}} by the Bulls. They were eliminated 3 times by Chicago, {{who went on to}} win the title each time. The rivalry <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> due to the return of the Bulls to the playoffs in the post-Michael Jordan era and the emergence of Dwyane Wade and Derrick Rose. The revived rivalry has been very physical, involving rough plays and hard fouls between players, most notably the actions of former Heat player James Posey. The Bulls and Heat met in the 2011 Eastern Conference Finals, with the Heat winning in 5 games. On March 27, 2013, Chicago snapped Miami's 27-game winning streak. The Bulls and Heat met later that year in the 2013 Eastern Conference Semifinals. Miami won the series 4–1. Since LeBron James's departure from Miami, the Bulls-Heat rivalry has experienced a tough in comparison to the better part of the century as the Bulls chop the Heat's playoff hopes in the 2017 regular season.|$|E
25|$|Robin is {{devastated by}} her cousin Georgie's (Lindze Letherman) death in December 2007. After Georgie's funeral and Maxie's (Kirsten Storms) horrible {{outburst}} at Felicia (Kristina Wagner), she seeks comfort in Patrick's arms, because he truly knows her and sees {{her as she}} truly is, and tells him {{that it is not}} about getting back together, or a baby or even sex, but that she just wants him to hold her. Caught in a moment, they end up making love. That night, a condom breaks and Robin becomes pregnant, although she is unaware of this until weeks later. Dr. Kelly Lee tells Robin that the date of conception would have to be sometime around Christmas, which was around the time when Patrick and Robin had sex. Robin, worried that Patrick now has HIV, is about to tell him, but when she walks into the locker room she hears Dr. Julian tell Patrick that the HIV test he took (after he realizes that the condom had broken when he and Robin had sex) <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> negative. With the news that Patrick is not infected, Robin makes up her mind not to tell Patrick about the pregnancy just yet. Robin later blurts out to Patrick that she is pregnant, but leaves out {{the fact that he is}} the father. She tells him that she went to a sperm bank and that she does not know who her baby's father is. Although he thinks she is having a baby with someone else, Patrick cannot stay away from Robin or her child. After several occurrences, Patrick slowly realizes that he may in fact be the father of her baby. After they have a heart to heart, however, and Patrick asks about the paternity of the baby. Robin admits he is the father. But even though she is pregnant, Robin cannot let go of the fact that he never wanted children. Arguments and resentment builds from both sides- Patrick wanting to be a part of his child's life, Robin telling him it's her baby that he never wanted. Eventually, being confronted by her past—remembering how wrong she believed Carly was to keep baby Michael's paternity from AJ (Billy Warlock), or even her own mother keeping her away from her father the first 6 years of her life—Patrick and Robin forgave one another and started the movement up again in their own relationship. Over time, Patrick and Robin grow even closer and Patrick falls even more in love with Robin, and with the child he never wanted.|$|E

500|$|Musically, [...] "Yasss Bish" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "bouncy drill anthem" [...] with a trap beat. It features a stripped back hip hop production that encompasses intense Roland TR-808 drum hits, a [...] "sinister, echo-y" [...] vocal loop, [...] "eerie" [...] shimmering synthesizers, foreboding snares, and the sound of church bells ringing in an ominous tone. Minaj's vocals in [...] "Yasss Bish" [...] have been described as [...] "melodic" [...] with a [...] "fierce" [...] message, while her rapping has been compared to the works of Southern hip hop group Migos. Several critics including Kyle Harvey of The Grio and Emma Goddard of Bustle noted the change in sound to be the beginning of a new image for Minaj. Harvey said the song continued her goal of shedding her image of a pop act, while Goddard said: [...] "Although this song is definitely NSFW and it's completely improbable that we'll hear British sisters Sophia Grace and Rosie rapping her song anytime soon, Minaj <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> strong with a new image." ...|$|E
