5|$|At the hospital, Natasha blames Andrew for the crash. She learns Ed has a {{fractured}} collarbone and sits with {{him until he}} wakes up. When he does, Natasha kisses him. They begin dating, but Natasha worries {{that they do not}} have much in common. Natasha helps organise a ball for the university and takes an immediate dislike to Ed's vintage suit. She spills coffee on it and then lends Ed a nicer one that she found. Ed realises what she has done and they fight. After apologising to each other, Natasha decides to break up with Ed, as they are too different. When Natasha finds Andrew having a fit in Charlie's, she learns that he has epilepsy. She agrees to keep it a secret. After he collapses, Natasha encourages Andrew to go to the hospital for tests. Before he can leave, he suffers a fit in front of Paul. Andrew initially blames Natasha for causing the fit when Paul takes Charlie's away from him. She then helps him to convince Paul to change his mind. Natasha and Andrew begin dating again in secret. They later decide to tell everyone and Summer reveals that she already knew and does not mind. Natasha later finds an old email from Andrew proclaiming his love for Summer and she begins to worry about her relationship with him. However, Andrew reassures her that he loves her and their relationship is <b>different</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> around. Natasha asks Andrew to take a month of celibacy, but they end up breaking it early. Natasha quits university and tells Andrew that she is leaving Erinsborough to travel around Europe. She asks Andrew to come with her and he agrees. They leave the following day with Paul's blessing.|$|E
25|$|Several Deputies and {{high-ranking}} {{civil servants}} {{were of the}} opinion that Luxembourg could retain a measure of autonomy under the military administration, as had occurred in World War I, and attempts were made to come to some sort of arrangement with Germany. However, it was soon made clear by the authorities in Berlin that Luxembourg's fate would be very <b>different</b> <b>this</b> <b>time.</b> The Nazis considered the Luxembourgish people as just another Germanic ethnic group and the Grand Duchy a German territory. The military authorities had to leave Luxembourg by 31 July 1940, {{to be replaced by a}} civil administration under Gustav Simon.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Appalachian State and Michigan {{agreed to}} play a rematch, {{scheduled}} for 2014 to be the season-opener for both teams. Appalachian State was paid $850,000 to play this game. Michigan's athletic director, Dave Brandon, felt a rematch would be {{an excellent way to}} gain attention for Michigan football and said [...] "The networks were fighting over who gets to televise that game." [...] Jerry Moore said that [...] "To have the University of Michigan invite us back is the ultimate compliment for us as a program and a university. We're grateful for the opportunity to have a new generation of players experience a gameday at the Big House and to test themselves against college football's all-time winningest program." [...] Appalachian State played their first year of football in the FBS in 2014 and joined the Sun Belt Conference as full members. The rematch was much <b>different</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> around, with Michigan beating Appalachian State 52–14; Appalachian State never held a lead in the game.|$|E

2500|$|In 1573 a new {{academy in}} Padua, the Accademia degli Rinascenti, hired him as music-master with duties {{similar to those}} he had held at the {{previous}} academy of the Elevati; he even hired as assistants {{some of the same}} people who had helped him before. [...] <b>Different</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> was the existence of a rival academy in Padua, the Accademia degli Animosi, but neither academy lasted for long. [...] Competition from nearby Venice, one of the major musical centers of Europe at the time, was too intense to allow for multiple such institutions in Padua, and just three years later, in 1576, an outbreak of bubonic plague killed 12,000 in the city and ended most of the significant musical activity there for years. [...] Portinaro himself survived the plague, and was hired as maestro di cappella at Padua Cathedral in December 1576, staying there at least through August 1577, from which month a payment record survives. [...] Cathedral archives indicate that he was dead in by January 1579, at which time the administration was searching for his replacement; however the date and circumstances of his death are not known.|$|E
2500|$|Series {{executive}} {{producers and}} co-creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk stated that, {{as with the}} second season, [...] "many actors" [...] would return for the third season in different roles. Jessica Lange, Evan Peters and Sarah Paulson all confirmed their returns. Murphy added that Lange would portray a [...] "real glamour-cat lady", whose name was later revealed to be Fiona Goode. Paulson {{said in an interview}} that her character would [...] "definitely [...] different [...]" [...] She added, [...] "Basically, she's going to look different, and my relationship to Lange is going to be quite <b>different</b> <b>this</b> <b>time.</b> At the beginning of last season, no one knew that Lana would be the hero, so it's possible I could end up the evil one this year. As of right now, there will be some of Lana Winters' qualities in my character, but I don't know for sure." [...] Taissa Farmiga, who played a lead role in the first season, starred as Zoe Benson, a character involved in a prominent romance with Peters' character. Lily Rabe and Frances Conroy portrayed series regulars Misty Day and Myrtle Snow, respectively. Kathy Bates co-starred as Delphine LaLaurie, an evil woman from the past who tortures her slaves. Murphy stated that Bates' character would be [...] "five times worse than [...] Misery character" [...] and is also inspired by a [...] "true event". It was reported on May 22, 2013 that Emma Roberts would co-star as Madison Montgomery, a difficult Hollywood starlet.|$|E

60|$|Then {{father and}} {{daughter}} fought over the old score, the one doggedly, imperturbably, the other spiritedly, with flashing eyes. It was <b>different</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> however, for it ended in Lucy saying Bostil would never risk another race. That stung Bostil, and it cost him an effort to control his temper.|$|E
60|$|While the {{fisherman}} and Dick had been hurrying to them, Andrew and Whitney, well armed, crossed the bank toward the wreck and then separated at {{a short distance}} from her. Andrew went straight forward while his comrade made a round so as to approach her from the other side.

6000|$|... "Listen," [...] {{she went}} on. [...] "He came when I was undressing for bed. I heard the horse. He {{knocked on the}} door. Something terrible {{happened}} to me then. I felt sick and my head wasn't clear. I remember next--his being in the room--the lamp was out--I couldn't see very well. He thought I was sick {{and he gave me}} a drink and let the air blow in on me through the window. I remember I lay back in the chair and I thought. And I listened. When would you come? I didn't feel that you could leave me there alone with him. For his coming was <b>different</b> <b>this</b> <b>time.</b> That pain like a blade in my side!... When it came I was not the same. I loved you. I understood then. I belonged to you. I couldn't let him touch me. I had never been his wife. When I realized this--that he was there, that you might suffer for it--I cried right out.|$|E
60|$|But yet I {{can never}} quite {{think that is}} so. This time, surely, it is <b>different.</b> <b>This</b> <b>time</b> may indeed be the {{beginning}} of a permanent change; this time there are new elements, new methods and a new spirit at work upon construction that the world has never known before. Mankind may be now in the dawn of a fresh phase of living altogether. It is possible. The forces of construction are proportionally gigantic. There was never so much clear and critical thought in the world as there is now, never so large a body of generally accessible knowledge and suggestion, never anything like the same breadth of outlook, the same universality of imaginative freedom. That is so in spite of infinite turmoil and confusion. Moreover the effort now is less concentrated, less dramatic. There is no one vital center to the modern movement which disaster can strike or decay undermine. If Paris or New York slacken and grow dull and materialist, if Berlin and London conspire for a mutual destruction, Tokio or Baku or Valparaiso or Christiania or Smyrna or Delhi will shelter and continue the onward impetus.|$|E
60|$|Instinctively I cocked and leveled the rifle, {{and though}} I could not clearly see the red animal bearing down the slope, such was my state that I fired. Then {{followed}} a roaring crash--a terrible breaking onslaught upon the brush--and the huge red mass seemed to flash down toward me. I worked the lever of the rifle. But I had forgotten Haught's caution. I {{did not work}} the lever far enough down, so that the next cartridge jammed in the receiver. With a second shock, <b>different</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> I tried again. In vain! The terrible crashing of brush appeared right upon me. For an instant that seemed an age I stood riveted to the spot, my blood congealing, my heart choking me, my tongue pasted {{to the roof of}} my mouth. Then I dropped the rifle and whirled to plunge away. Like a deer I bounded. I took prodigious bounds. To escape--to find a tree to leap into--that was my only thought. A few rods down the slope--it seemed a mile--I reached a pine with low branches. Like a squirrel I ran up this--straddled a limb high up--and gazed back.|$|E

60|$|Joan got {{both arms}} round {{his neck and}} with her head against him she held him tightly, trying, praying to think how to meet this long-dreaded moment. After all, what was the use to try? This was the hour of Gold! Sacrifice, hope, courage, nobility, fidelity--these had no place here now. Men were the {{embodiment}} of passion--ferocity. They breathed only possession, and the thing in the balance was death. Women were creatures to hunger and fight for, but womanhood was nothing. Joan knew all this with a desperate hardening certainty, and almost she gave in. Strangely, thought of Gulden flashed up to make her again strong! Then she raised her face and began the old pleading with Jim, but <b>different</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> when it seemed that absolutely all was at stake. She begged him, she importuned him, to listen to reason, to be guided by her, to fight the wildness that had obsessed him, {{to make sure that}} she would not be left alone. All in vain! He swore he would kill Kells and any other bandit who stood {{in the way of his}} leading her free out of that cabin. He was wild to fight. He might never have felt fear of these robbers. He would not listen to any possibility of defeat for himself, or the possibility that in the event of Kells's death she would be worse off. He laughed at her strange, morbid fears of Gulden. He was immovable.|$|E
6000|$|... "These sour {{men of the}} conventicles {{have ever}} been stiff-necked and rebellious," [...] he said, [...] "and have {{enforced}} their will upon our monarchs. I have not forgotten," [...] he went on, striking the hilt of his sword angrily, [...] "the insults which were put upon Queen Mary when she was preached to and lectured publicly by the sour fanatic Knox, and was treated, forsooth, {{as if she had}} been some trader's daughter who had ventured to laugh on a Sunday. Her son, too, was kept under the control of these men until he was summoned to England. It is time that Scotland were rid of the domination of these knaves, and if I live I will sweep them from the land. In courage my wild men are more than a match for the Lowlanders. It is true that in the old days the clans could never carry their forays southward, for, unaccustomed to discipline and unprovided with horses or even with firearms, they fared but badly when opposed to steel-clad men and knights in armor. But I trust it will be <b>different</b> <b>this</b> <b>time.</b> I cannot hope to infuse any great discipline among them. But they can at least be caught to charge in line, and their broad claymores may be trusted to hew a way for them through the lines of the Lowlanders. I trust, above all things, that the king will not be persuaded to negotiate with the traitors who are opposed to him. I know, Master Furness, that, from what you have said, your views run not there with mine, and that you think a compromise is desirable. But you do not know these fanatics as I do. While they clamor for toleration, they are the narrowest of bigots, and will themselves tolerate nothing. Already I have news that the convention between the Scotch conventicle and the English rebels is agreed to, and that an order has gone forth that the Presbyterian rites are to be observed in all the churches of England. They say that thousands of divines will be turned from their churches and their places filled with ignorant fanatics, and this they call religious liberty. Why, when Laud was in power his rule was as a silken thread compared to the hempen rope of these bigots, and should the king make terms with them, it will be only to rule henceforth at their bidding, and to be but an instrument in their hands for enforcing their will upon the people of these countries." ...|$|E
