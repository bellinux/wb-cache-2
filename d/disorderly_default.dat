40|$|Pointing {{out that}} <b>disorderly</b> <b>default</b> or further bailouts {{are not the}} only {{solution}} to the Greek debt crisis, Daniel Gros and Thomas Mayer argue in this CEPS commentary that a sounder and less messy approach would be {{to take advantage of the}} current low prices of Greek debt to go for a market-based debt reduction...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{cobbling}} {{together an}} impressive $ 1 trillion rescue package for countries with potential funding problems, {{the threat of}} a <b>disorderly</b> <b>default</b> still looms over the eurozone, creating systemic financial instability at the EU and possibly global level. Against this background, Daniel Gros and Thomas Mayer renew their call {{for the creation of a}} European Monetary Fund (EMF) in an update to their Policy Brief issued in February...|$|E
40|$|The eurozone is in {{recession}} and will show negative growth in 2012, notes Stefano Micossi {{in this new}} CEPS Policy Brief. Hopes that fiscal consolidation could spur growth by improving household and business confidence are not materialising, because in reality, domestic demand has been hit too hard by fiscal consolidation, and investment throughout the Union remains well below pre-crisis levels. The author calls upon the European Council to consider launching a new growth initiative, centered on mobilising vast resources at EU level for investment in worthy projects of common interest Europe-wide. The key {{goal is to make}} sure that there is light at the end of the tunnel, lest at some stage the unbearable social and political costs of adjustment lead to a breakdown of domestic political systems and <b>disorderly</b> <b>default...</b>|$|E
40|$|The recent wave of {{sovereign}} default has underscored {{the limits of}} the current market-based regime. Recently two alternative approaches propose a contractual approach by way of the introduction of collective action clauses (CAC) in bond contracts, and a statutory approach put forward by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which calls for the establishment of an international debt restructuring mechanism (called the sovereign debt restructuring mechanism or SDRM) that would have many of the features of an international bankruptcy regime. This paper assesses the two crisis-resolution mechanisms. It shows that although no consensus exists on whether the best approach about how to manage and resolve sovereign debt crises is to promote the use of collective action clauses, or to create a statutory mechanism, it is, nevertheless, evident that the SDRM is shelved for the time being. It examines the reasons for this, and argues that to the contrary, a complementary approach that combines elements of both the CAC and the SDRM (now proposed by the IMF) has the potential to help reduce the unacceptably large costs associated with <b>disorderly</b> <b>defaults</b> by sovereign governments whose debt burdens have become unsustainable...|$|R
40|$|Europe’s {{efforts to}} {{stabilize}} its finances are failing, {{and the region}} needs to prepare for widespread restructuring of sovereign and bank debt. Peter Boone and Simon Johnson argue that Europe’s financial system has relied on a policy of protecting creditors from default and has thus spread pervasive moral hazard—a presumption by creditors {{that they will not}} take losses on their loans to Greece and other ailing countries. The authors argue that this situation is no longer tenable and examine three possible scenarios for the coming months as the sovereign debt crisis evolves. Under the first scenario, the euro area would try to reassert its commitment to avoid defaults and inflation. This continuation of the moral hazard regime would require severe austerity for Greece and other countries {{on the periphery of the}} euro area. The second scenario involves elimination of the moral hazard regime. The euro area would admit that some sovereigns have too much debt. A series of debt restructurings would follow. The final scenario would be for policymakers to continue to contradict themselves by promising selective defaults or restructurings of some countries’ debts while maintaining that they can ensure the stability of the rest of the euro area. But the authors argue that it is an illusion to believe that selective restructuring would not introduce contagion. Such an approach would result in panic, massive capital flight, and <b>disorderly</b> <b>defaults.</b> The ensuing chaos would in turn lead to a negatively charged political atmosphere that would make consensus nearly impossible. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{argues that}} {{the origins of the}} Greek malaise are {{primarily}} political rather than economic and rooted in the delay, postponement, and half-hearted implementation of public policy reforms that preceded the crisis. The 2007 - 08 global economic crisis triggered market scrutiny over Greece, as it brought to an end a period of abundant liquidity and a relaxed attitude by global markets vis a vis Eurozone members. Greece's impossible fiscal position was brutally exposed, and a downward spiral began. The article also argues that although Greece set itself up for failure, the Eurozone's inability to act swiftly and early, to diagnose the problem correctly and to combine a policy mix consisting of budgetary consolidation and policy reform further exacerbated the problem. Despite the fact that <b>disorderly</b> <b>default</b> has been avoided and a sense of normalcy has returned, Greece has to move swiftly on the reforms front to avoid disaster...|$|E
