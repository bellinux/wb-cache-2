We tested four models of sperm storage using a 1 : 1 dilution in TTF-ULE-Bear extender (TesT-fructose-egg yolk-glycerol 6 %) : (i) second 1 : 1 dilution at room temperature (RT), cooling at 5 °C in a tube and <b>final</b> <b>dilution</b> (100  ×  10  sperm ml) (Standard); (ii) <b>final</b> <b>dilution</b> at RT and cooling in a tube (FD-Tube); (iii) <b>final</b> <b>dilution</b> at RT and cooling in 0. 25  ml plastic straw (FD-Straw); and (iv) <b>final</b> <b>dilution</b> at RT in extender supplemented with 1. 5 % gelatine (Gelatine) and cooling in a 0. 25  ml plastic straw. A Standard sample was stored at 5 °C for 1  hr (Control); {{the rest of the}} samples (Standard, FD-Tube, FD-Straw, Gelatine) were stored for 24 or 48  hrs before freezing (100  ×  10  sperm ml, glycerol 6 %). The quality of the samples was assessed for motility by CASA, and viability (SYBR- 14 /propidium iodide-PI-; VIAB), acrosomal status (PNA-FITC/PI; iACR) and apoptotic status (YO-PRO- 1 /PI; YOPRO-) by flow cytometry. At pre-freezing, after 48  hr, Gelatine showed significantly higher viability (for VIAB and YOPRO-) and progressiveness (PM, LIN and STR). At 48  hr, Gelatine showed similar YOPRO-, iACR, LIN, STR and ALH respect to Control. At both 24 and 48  h post-thawing, Gelatine sample had similar scores for YOPRO-, iACR, LIN, STR, WOB and VIAB (only 24  hr) when compared with Control, and lower for TM, PM, rapidPM, VAP and ALH. No differences were found among others experimental groups with respect to Control. In conclusion, gelatine could be a suitable alternative to preserve the viability and progressive motility of brown bear ejaculates during long-term pre-freezing storage at 5 °C.

In the present paper starch hydrolysis using commercial enzymes of industrial grade are studied aiming to develop an easy and cheap analysis, available to {{a greater number of}} industries and technicians. The proposed method is simple, divided in a first step where soluble sugars are eliminated from the samples by using dialysis, followed by starch hydrolysis of the retained fraction with a thermoresistent bacterial alfa-amylase (Termamyl 120 L®) and an amyloglucosidase (AMG 300 L®). The hydrolysis conditions were those suggested by the enzyme producer. After the hydrolysis step the material was dialysed again for the extraction of glucose that was quantified by the glucose-oxidase colorimetric reactant.

40|$|Mine {{operators}} and Mine Safety and Health Administration inspectors use portable gas monitors in underground mines to measure worker exposure to various gases such as methane, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2). Even in relatively small concentrations, NO 2 can produce harmful side effects in underground workers. Mines using equipment powered by diesel engines, carrying out explosive blasting operations, and performing extensive arc welding and/or cutting work will have measurable quantities of NO 2 released by these processes. Workers {{in these areas}} often use gas monitors to warn of excessive gas concentrations {{and to help them}} determine when to increase ventilation air that will dilute these gases, thus minimizing exposures to this gas. Portable gas monitors, used to measure NO 2 levels, must be calibrated before each use. Calibration is typically performed using a small portable pressurized cylinder containing a certified gas mixture. The certified NO 2 standard mixture, usually 10 ppm NO 2 concentration, is diluted with either air or nitrogen gas. To determine the stability of commercially available portable gas standards, two different cylinders containing NO 2 in nominal 10 -ppm concentrations were examined. One cylinder was diluted in air, the other, in nitrogen. Baseline NO 2 mixtures were generated using a standard liquid NO 2 permeation tube operated at a constant temperature. <b>Final</b> <b>dilutions</b> of the test gas mixtures were made with air or with nitrogen using a mass flow-controlled gas dilution system. This study showed that, when a permeation-type NO 2 generator is used, the electrochemical sensors in portable NO 2 monitors provide identical results for gas mixtures whether they are diluted with air or with nitrogen. Two different gas monitors, one with a two-electrode sensor and one with a three-electrode sensor, were used to measure gas concentrations in the two commercially available cylinders. One month after the cylinders were delivered, the NO 2 -in-nitrogen cylinder, stated to contain 10 ppm NO 2, measured 8. 13 ppm. The NO 2 -in-air cylinder, also stated to hold 10 ppm NO 2, measured 6. 88 ppm. Therefore, before using NO 2 gas cylinders to calibrate monitors, it is recommended that their concentrations be verified either by manufacturer recertification or by comparing the stated cylinder gas concentrations to a laboratory-based permeation tube-generated standard.

The interassay coefficient of variation for the immun-onephelometric assay was 7 % within a working range be-tween 0. 05 and 0. 7. rg of apoA-ll per sample (corresponding to a 1500 -fold <b>final</b> <b>dilution</b> of serum). No extraction of samples with organic solvent is necessary if the triglyceride concentration is < 4 g/L. Additional Keyphrases: hyperilpidemia. coronary heart dis...|$|E
40|$|HIV- 1 {{survival}} kinetics in {{peritoneal dialysis}} effluent. Viable and potentially infectious HIV- 1 has been {{recovered from the}} peritoneal dialysis effluent (PDE) of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). No information had previously been available as to how long HIV- 1 could survive in this environment, and no data were available as to how long HIV- 1 could survive on peritoneal dialysis exchange tubing (PDET). Therefore, {{this study was designed}} to answer these questions. HIV- 1 Mn was added to PDE and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 0 to 14 days. Following centrifugation, the cellular component of the PDE mixture was placed in co-culture with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from HIV negative donors. Aliquots from the co-cultures were removed after 14 days and assayed for the HIV- 1 -P 24 antigen. High levels of HIV P 24 antigen were recovered up to and including seven days of room temperature incubation. HIV could not be recovered from PDE that had been incubated at room temperature for 10 to 14 days. Ten milliters of HIV-PDE mixture was placed within PDET and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. The solution was then removed by gravity drainage. After drying times of 0 to 168 hours, the tubing was flushed with HIV culture medium and placed in co-culture with PBMCs from HIV negative donors. The culture supernatant was assayed for the HIV- 1 P 24 antigen as a marker of viral replication. High levels of HIV- 1 P 24 antigen were recovered from the PDET wash for up to and including 48 hours of drying time. No viable virus could be detected for drying times of between 72 and 168 hours. To determine if common disinfectants found in the dialysis unit could inactivate HIV, dilutions of Amukin™ 50 % and household bleach were prepared at final concentrations ranging from 1 : 32 to 1 : 2048. These disinfectant solutions were incubated with PDE containing HIV for 10 minutes. The cellular fraction of the PDE was isolated by centrifugation, washed, and placed in co-cultures with peripheral blood mononuclear cells. HIV P 24 antigen levels were assayed every three days for 28 days. Amukin™ 50 % and a 10 % household bleach solution were effective in killing HIV in PDE at dilutions up to and including 1 : 512. These results indicate that HIV can survive in PDE at room temperature for up to seven days. HIV can survive on peritoneal dialysis exchange tubing for up to 48 hours. <b>Final</b> <b>dilutions</b> of 1 : 512 Amukin™ 50 % and 10 % household bleach, after 10 minutes of exposure, are effective viricidal agents in disinfecting PDE...|$|R
40|$|In a {{multidisciplinary}} ex situ experiment, benthic bacterial deep-sea communities from 2, 500 m water depth at the Long-Term Ecological Research Observatory HAUSGARTEN (stationPS 93 / 050 - 5 and 6), were retrieved using a TV-guided multiple corer. Surface sediments (0 - 2 cm) of 16 cores were mixed with sterile filtered deep-sea {{water to a}} <b>final</b> sediment <b>dilution</b> of 3. 5 fold. The slurries were split and supplemented with five different types of habitat-related detritus: chitin, as the most abundant biopolymer in the oceans, and four different naturally occurring Arctic algae species, i. e. Thalassiosira weissflogii, Emiliania huxleyi, Bacillaria sp. and Melosira arctica. Incubations were performed in five replicates, at in situ temperature and at atmospheric pressure, {{as well as at}} in situ pressure of 250 atm. At the start of the incubation and after 23 days, changes in key community functions, i. e. extracellular enzymatic activity, oxygen respiration and secondary production of biomass (bacterial cell numbers and biomass), were assessed along with changes in the bacterial community composition based on 16 S rRNA gene and 16 S rRNA Illumina sequencing. In summary, differences in community structure and in the uptake and remineralization of carbon in the different treatments suggest an effect of organic matter quality on bacterial diversity as well as on carbon turnover at the seafloor...|$|R
40|$|A rhamnolipid {{producing}} bacterium, P. aeruginosa MM 1011 {{was previously}} isolated from crude oil over years. Isolated strain was identified by morphological, biochemical, physiological and 16 srRNA (1). The identified Pseudomonas aeruginosa confirmed by Persian Type Culture Collection (PTCC idendification confirmation report No. 1011). Glycolipid production by isolated bacterium using {{sugar beet molasses}} as a carbon and energy source was investigated. MM 1011, {{was used for the}} development of a continuous process for biosurfactant production. The active compounds were identified as rhamnolipids. A final medium for production was designed in continuous culture by means of medium shifts, since the formation of surface-active compounds was decisively influenced by the composition and concentration of the medium components. In the presence of yeast extract, biosurfactant production was poor. For the nitrogen-source nitrate, which was superior to ammonium, an optimum carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of ca. 18 existed. The iron concentration needed to be minimized to 27. 5 μg of FeSO 4. 7 H 20 per g of glucose. A carbon-to-phosphate ratio,Şc/p= 20, obtained the maximum production of rhamnolipids. The <b>final</b> productivity <b>dilution</b> rate diagram indicated that biosurfactant production was correlated to low growth rates (dilution rate below 0. 18 h− 1). With a medium containing 24. 2 gr of glucose γl- 1, a biosurfactant concentration (expressed as rhamnolipids) of up to 1. 1 gr γl- 1 was obtained in the cell-free culture liquid. The rhamnolipid mass concentration was 7. 5 mg ml- 1 and surface tension was reduced to 20 mN m- 1...|$|R
