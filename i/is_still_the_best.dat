5|$|The model's first hurdle was the Pickering series, lines {{which did}} not fit Balmer's formula. When {{challenged}} on this by Alfred Fowler, Bohr replied that they were caused by ionised helium, helium atoms with only one electron. The Bohr model was found to work for such ions. Many older physicists, like Thomson, Rayleigh and Hendrik Lorentz, {{did not like the}} trilogy, but the younger generation, including Rutherford, David Hilbert, Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, Max Born and Arnold Sommerfeld saw it as a breakthrough. The trilogy's acceptance was entirely due to its ability to explain phenomena which stymied other models, and to predict results that were subsequently verified by experiments. Today, the Bohr model of the atom has been superseded, but <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> known model of the atom, as it often appears in high school physics and chemistry texts.|$|E

Her first {{national}} record mark came in 1985, when she ran a time of 8:52.32 minutes for the 3000 metres. She improved this to 8:50.56 the following month and broke Patricia Deneuville's French mile record a month after that (registering a time of 4:39.35 mins). In July 1986 she lopped {{three and a half}} seconds off her 3000m mark, set a time of 5:39.00 mins for the 2000m, then bettered Joëlle de Brouwer's 5000 metres record by almost twenty seconds, setting a new standard of 15:32.92 mins. Two further improvements over 3000m and 5000m came in 1988, with runs of 8:44.19 and 15:18.24 mins respectively. She also beat Christine Loiseau's record over 10,000m that year. In 1990 she ran 15:16.44 mins for the 5000m, which was to be her last national mark over that distance. Her run of 31:51.68 minutes at that year's European Championships made her the first Frenchwoman to complete the event in under 32 minutes. Although her 2000m time <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> set by a French athlete, all her records in other events were not long-standing: her 3000m was beaten by Marie-Pierre Duros after a year, her 10,000m mark was beaten by Rosario Murcia after two years, while her 5000m was broken after four years by Farida Fatès.|$|E

According to them, [...] "We were just copying Mario, weren't we? Which, to this day, <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> 3D camera." [...] A {{lot of time and}} care was spent on system performance optimisation, animation details, and audiovisual appeal. For example, {{to increase the number of}} simultaneous light sources to four, one programmer spent four months deciphering and rewriting the Nintendo-supplied Japanese-commented microcode for the Nintendo 64's Reality Coprocessor, while another microcoded the support for MP3, reverberation, and Dolby Pro Logic surround sound. A developer also spent weeks optimising the system's ability to display distant backdrops as texture tiles to enhance gameplay navigation and visual appeal. Due in part to its extensive vocal track, Conker's Bad Fur Day is one of the few Nintendo 64 games that features a 64MB cartridge.|$|E

GameDaily listed {{the game as}} one of the [...] "Most Influential Video Games" [...] and stated it [...] "defined the 3-D platform experience, influencing numerous designers to create their own, original offerings". GamesTM noted many game companies, including Nintendo, have tried to develop a platform game to match up to Super Mario 64. Nintendo's first party developer, Rare, reflected in 2013 that during the development of 2001's Conker's Bad Fur Day, they had originally drawn inspiration from their deep analysis of the gameplay and camera mechanics of Super Mario 64: [...] "We were just copying Mario, weren't we? Which, to this day, <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> 3D camera." [...] Super Mario 64 is notable for its sense of freedom and non-linearity. A central hub, where controls can be learned before entering levels themselves, has been used in many 3D platformers since. In addition, the game's mission-based level design is an inspiration for other game designers. Martin Hollis, who produced and directed GoldenEye 007, says [...] "the idea for the huge variety of missions within a level came from Super Mario 64". In 2012, Dan Houser, a prominent figure {{in the development of the}} Grand Theft Auto series, stated, [...] "Anyone who makes 3D games who says they've not borrowed something from Mario or Zelda [...] is lying." [...] Tetsuya Nomura, a leading designer at Square Enix, stated in 2016 that Super Mario 64 was the impetus for the creation of the Kingdom Hearts series.|$|E
