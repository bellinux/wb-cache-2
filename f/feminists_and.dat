5|$|Male {{participation}} in feminism is encouraged by <b>feminists</b> <b>and</b> {{is seen as}} an important strategy for achieving full societal commitment to gender equality. Many male <b>feminists</b> <b>and</b> pro-feminists are active in both women's rights activism, feminist theory, and masculinity studies. However, some argue that while male engagement with feminism is necessary, it is problematic because of the ingrained social influences of patriarchy in gender relations. The consensus today in feminist and masculinity theories is that both genders can and should cooperate to achieve the larger goals of feminism. It has been proposed that, in large part, this can be achieved through considerations of women's agency.|$|E
5|$|Lépine's {{actions have}} been {{variously}} ascribed to psychiatric diagnoses such as personality disorder, psychosis, or attachment disorder, or societal {{factors such as}} poverty, isolation, powerlessness, and violence in the media. The massacre is regarded by criminologists {{as an example of}} a hate crime against women, and by <b>feminists</b> <b>and</b> government officials as misogynist attack and an example of the larger issue of violence against women.|$|E
5|$|After its rediscovery, {{observers}} often {{assumed that}} the image was always used as a call to inspire women workers to join the war effort. However, during the war the image was strictly internal to Westinghouse, displayed only during February 1943, and was not for recruitment but to exhort already-hired women to work harder. <b>Feminists</b> <b>and</b> others have seized upon the uplifting attitude and apparent message to remake the image into many different forms, including self empowerment, campaign promotion, advertising, and parodies.|$|E

5|$|She {{maintained}} {{some political}} {{communication with the}} political right wing. She authored the book Right-Wing Women, reviewed as premised on agreement between <b>feminists</b> <b>and</b> right-wing women {{on the existence of}} domination by men in sex and class, but disagreement on strategy. She testified at a Meese Commission hearing on pornography, while Attorney General Edwin Meese was serving socially conservative President Reagan. She had a political discourse with National Review writer David Frum and their spouses arranged by Christopher Hitchens.|$|E
5|$|Starling and Bayliss's lectures {{had been}} {{infiltrated}} by two Swedish <b>feminists</b> <b>and</b> anti-vivisection activists, Lizzy Lind af Hageby and Leisa Katherine Schartau. The women {{had known each}} other since childhood and came from distinguished families. Lind af Hageby, who had attended Cheltenham Ladies College in England, was the granddaughter of a chamberlain to the King of Sweden and daughter of a former chief justice of Sweden. Schartau's father was a Swedish army captain.|$|E
5|$|Andrea Rita Dworkin (September 26, 1946– April 9, 2005) was an American radical {{feminist and}} writer {{best known for}} her {{criticism}} of pornography, which she argued was linked to rape and other forms of violence against women. Her views were widely criticized by liberal <b>feminists</b> <b>and</b> others. At the same time, she maintained a dialogue with political conservatives, and wrote a topically-related book, Right-Wing Women. After suffering abuse from her first husband, she was introduced to radical feminist literature, and began writing Woman Hating. Coming to New York, she became an activist on several issues and a writer, eventually publishing 10 books on feminism.|$|E
40|$|This paper reconsiders the {{relationships}} between <b>feminist</b> perspectives <b>and</b> the figurational/process sociological perspective of Norbert Elias for understanding gender, sport and sport-related activities. The main aim of the article is to respond to Colwell’s (1999) claim that {{there are differences between}} <b>feminist</b> <b>and</b> figurational approaches to understanding and explaining gender that potentially negate the possibility of being a <b>feminist</b> <b>and</b> figurational sociologist at the same time. The paper makes a contribution to the wider discussions about the adequacy of Elias’s work in understanding gender and sport, and the potential of blending <b>feminist</b> <b>and</b> figurational perspectives on sport and gender. The essay introduces the principles underlying <b>feminist</b> <b>and</b> figurational approaches to sociology. The key features of the on-going debate about the differences between <b>feminist</b> <b>and</b> figurational approaches are briefly outlined. I reply to Colwell’s (1999) criticisms of my work and revisit issues surrounding the role of values and evaluation in sociology. Involved-detachment is introduced as a feminist interpretation of Elias’s theory of ever changing balances of involvement-detachment. The final part of the paper presents some reflections about working with involved-detachment in specific research on women’s involvement in sport-related fitness activities...|$|R

5|$|Pro-{{feminism}} is {{the support}} of feminism without implying that the supporter {{is a member of}} the feminist movement. The term is most often used in reference to men who are actively supportive of feminism. The activities of pro-feminist men's groups include anti-violence work with boys and young men in schools, offering sexual harassment workshops in workplaces, running community education campaigns, and counselling male perpetrators of violence. Pro-feminist men also may be involved in men's health, activism against pornography including anti-pornography legislation, men's studies, and the development of gender equity curricula in schools. This work is sometimes in collaboration with <b>feminists</b> <b>and</b> women's services, such as domestic violence and rape crisis centres.|$|E
5|$|Veronica goes to Dean O’Dell {{and asks}} for an exchange: Veronica tells him that his son spray-painted his car, and he will hire Weevil. Veronica talks to the {{gambling}} owner, who acts strangely. Veronica tracks his car before removing the tracker later. Veronica talks to Trish, who says that Kurt left for Kansas. Weevil starts his new job as a Hearst janitor. Piz gets a job on a campus radio show, where he interviews both the <b>feminists</b> <b>and</b> the fraternity boys. In {{the middle of the}} show, the feminists get a text that says that Claire, the girl who the fraternity boys pointed out, was raped. Veronica and Logan reconcile their relationship and kiss.|$|E

25|$|There are now an {{unprecedented}} array of styles and models, including full-coverage bras, balconette cup bras that expose the aerolas and nipples, and sports bras that {{can sometimes be}} worn as outerwear.

25|$|Nel Noddings' {{ethics of}} care has been criticised by both <b>feminists</b> <b>and</b> those who favour more traditional, and {{allegedly}} masculine, approaches to ethics. In brief, feminists object {{that the one}} caring is, in effect, carrying out the traditional female role in life of giving while receiving little in return. Those who accept more traditional approaches to ethics argue that the partiality shown to those closest to us in Noddings' theory is inappropriate.|$|E

25|$|Hughes {{was married}} to American poet Sylvia Plath from 1956 until her suicide in 1963 {{at the age of}} 30. Some <b>feminists</b> <b>and</b> some American admirers of Plath blamed him for her death. His last poetic work, Birthday Letters (1998), {{explored}} their complex relationship. These poems make reference to Plath's suicide, but none addresses directly the circumstances of her death. A poem discovered in October 2010, Last letter, describes what happened during the three days before her death.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, {{a scandal}} broke when police raided a private {{abortion}} clinic, detaining doctors, nurses and patients. They were jailed without {{a court order}} in Tlaxcoaque, subjected to extortion demands, {{and some of the}} women reported they were tortured. After her release, one of the victims filed a lawsuit alleging police brutality and the media picked up the story. In a first for Mexico's feminist movement, feminists published a notice in response to the situation, and obtained 283 signatories with different political alliances and gained 427 endorsements. For the first time, <b>feminists</b> <b>and</b> political parties spoke in harmony. The period marked slow, but steady gains for women in the country.|$|E
25|$|Many early <b>feminists</b> <b>and</b> {{advocates of}} women's rights were {{considered}} left-wing by their contemporaries. Feminist pioneer Mary Wollstonecraft {{was influenced by}} the radical thinker Thomas Paine. Many notable leftists have been strong supporters of gender equality such as: the Marxists Rosa Luxemburg, Clara Zetkin and Alexandra Kollontai; anarchists such as Virginia Bolten, Emma Goldman and Lucía Sánchez Saornil; and the socialists Helen Keller and Annie Besant. However, Marxists such as Rosa Luxemburg, Clara Zetkin and Alexandra Kollontai, though supporters of radical social equality for women, opposed feminism because they considered it to be a bourgeois ideology. Marxists were responsible for organizing the first International Working Women's Day events.|$|E
