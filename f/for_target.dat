5|$|A United States Army Armored Force {{requirement}} for a mobile anti-aircraft gun {{to support the}} coming North African Campaign resulted in the T28 project being revived soon after its cancellation. The new vehicles used the larger M3 Halftrack chassis and an M2E1 sight <b>for</b> <b>target</b> spotting, receiving the designation T28E1 Combination Gun Motor Carriage (CGMC).|$|E

5|$|A-10s were {{initially}} an unwelcome addition {{to many in}} the Air Force. Most pilots switching to the A-10 {{did not want to}} because fighter pilots traditionally favored speed and appearance. In 1987, many A-10s were shifted to the forward air control (FAC) role and redesignated OA-10. In the FAC role, the OA-10 is typically equipped with up to six pods of 2.75inch (70mm) Hydra rockets, usually with smoke or white phosphorus warheads used <b>for</b> <b>target</b> marking. OA-10s are physically unchanged and remain fully combat capable despite the redesignation.|$|E
5|$|Following the Soviet {{capture of}} that city, the {{remaining}} crew detonated scuttling {{charges in the}} wreck on 21 March to further destroy the ship. After the war, the ship was raised during 1945–46 by the Soviet Navy and transferred to Tallinn. Although reference books long stated that she was scrapped there or in Marienburg, in actuality she was towed out in 1948 and beached for long-term use as a target in shallow water off the island of Osmussaar in the Gulf of Finland. Last used <b>for</b> <b>target</b> practice around 1966, the remains are now submerged. Her bell {{was held in the}} collection of the Military History Museum of the Bundeswehr in Dresden as of 1990.|$|E
5|$|Impero {{was laid}} down in May 1938 and {{launched}} in November 1939. The entrance of Italy into World War II forced the Regia Marina to refocus its construction priorities on escort warships, so Impero was left incomplete. After Italy surrendered to the Allies on 8 September 1943, {{the rest of the}} Italian Navy steamed to Sardinia to rendezvous with their American contemporaries. Still incomplete in Trieste, Impero was captured by the Germans, who used the hulk <b>for</b> <b>target</b> practice. Sunk by Allied bombers in February 1945, she was refloated in 1947 and scrapped in Venice from 1948 to 1950.|$|E

5|$|The Domesday Book records ponies on Exmoor in 1086, and {{descendants}} of ponies {{removed from the}} moor in 1818 form the foundation bloodstock of today's Exmoor breed, although a breed society was not formed until 1921. The breed nearly became extinct after the Second World War, owing to soldiers using them <b>for</b> <b>target</b> practice and thieves killing them for their meat. After the war {{a small group of}} breeders worked to save the Exmoor, and during the 1950s ponies began to be exported to North America. The first stud book was published in 1963, and in 1981 publicity resulted in increased interest in the breed. As of 2010 there were an estimated 800 Exmoor ponies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The Tornado GR1B was a {{specialised}} anti-shipping {{variant of}} the GR1. A total of 26 were converted, which were based at RAF Lossiemouth, Scotland, replacing the Blackburn Buccaneer. Each aircraft was equipped to carry up to four Sea Eagle anti-ship missiles. At first the GR1B lacked the radar capability to track shipping, instead relying on the missile's seeker <b>for</b> <b>target</b> acquisition, later updates allowed target data to be fed from aircraft to missile.|$|E
5|$|The rifle had {{normally}} {{been used}} to shoot rabbits with the silencer and telescopic sight attached. The court heard that the telescopic sight {{had to be removed}} with a screwdriver, but it was usually left in place because it was time-consuming to realign it. Nevill's nephew visited the farmhouse on the weekend of 26–28 July 1985, and told the court that he had seen the rifle, in the gun cupboard in the ground-floor office, with the sight and silencer attached. He had taken the gun out and used it <b>for</b> <b>target</b> practice.|$|E

5|$|U-28 sank by {{accident}} on 17 March 1944, at the U-boat pier in Neustadt. During a training exercise, the boat had passed under a dummy freighter used <b>for</b> <b>target</b> practice. The commander-in-training failed {{to note the}} position of the stationary freighter, and the U-boat's conning tower was ripped off. Water flooded the control room, but the other compartments remained intact. The crew escaped by slowly equalizing the water pressure in the boat and swimming to the surface. The boat was raised in March 1944, but was stricken on 4 August. The submarine's crew suffered no casualties during her career.|$|E
5|$|A {{percentage}} {{of each group}} working in less contaminated areas was badged. Eventually, 18,875 film-badge dosimeters were issued to about 15% of the total work force. On {{the basis of this}} sampling, a theoretical total exposure was calculated for each person who did not have a personal badge. As expected, exposures <b>for</b> <b>target</b> ship crewmen who reboarded their ships after Baker were higher than those for support ship crews. The hulls of support ships that entered the lagoon after Baker became so radioactive that sleeping quarters were moved toward the center of each ship. Of the total mass of radioactive particles scattered by each explosion, 85% was unfissioned plutonium which produces alpha radiation not detected by film badges or Geiger counters. There was no method of detecting plutonium in a timely fashion, and participants were not monitored for ingestion of it.|$|E
5|$|During {{her second}} commission, Indiana {{spent most of}} her time laid up in the reserve fleet, {{occasionally}} participating in practice cruises. In January 1907 she helped provide relief {{in the aftermath of the}} 1907 Kingston earthquake. In 1908, the /40 caliber guns and most of the lighter guns were removed to compensate for the counterweights added to the main battery turrets and because the ammunition supply for the guns was considered problematic. A year later, twelve /50 caliber single-purpose guns were added midships and in the fighting tops. At the same time a cage mast was added. By 1913 it was speculated that the ship might soon be used <b>for</b> <b>target</b> practice, but instead, the ship was decommissioned on 23 May 1914. After the United States entered World War I, Indiana was commissioned for the third time and served as a training ship for gun crews near Tompkinsville, Staten Island and in the York River, and placed under the command of George Landenberger.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} announcement-period {{acquirer}} returns and <b>target</b> values <b>for</b> a large sample of cross-border acquisitions by U. S. firms, differentiating between {{private and public}} targets and paying {{particular attention to the}} legal protection of minority shareholders in the <b>target</b> country. <b>For</b> high-protection <b>target</b> countries, acquirer announcement-period returns are significantly negative <b>for</b> public <b>targets</b> and significantly positive <b>for</b> private <b>targets.</b> <b>For</b> low-protection <b>target</b> countries, the acquirer returns are significantly positive <b>for</b> public <b>targets</b> and insignificantly different from zero <b>for</b> private <b>targets.</b> <b>For</b> public <b>targets,</b> acquirer returns are decreasing and target-firm values and acquisition premia are increasing with the level of investor protection. <b>For</b> private <b>targets,</b> investor protection does not affect acquirer returns or target-firm values. We find that bidder returns decrease with the level of creditor protection in the target country and increase with the quality of accounting standards. Our results also show that in low- protection countries, firm-level corporate governance mechanisms, such as higher insider ownership, may substitute for the lower level of investor protection.

5|$|During {{spare time}} in filming, Tom Baker and Ian Marter (who played Harry Sullivan {{in the series}} and later novelised several Doctor Who scripts <b>for</b> <b>Target</b> Books) wrote a script for a Doctor Who film, Doctor Who meets Scratchman. The script, {{sometimes}} titled Doctor Who and the Big Game, saw the Doctor encounter the Daleks, meet the Devil known as Harry Scratch or Scratchman, robots known as Cybors, scarecrows made from bones, the Greek god Pan, and at times Vincent Price and Twiggy {{were associated with the}} production to play as the villain Harry Scratch and a possible new female companion after Elisabeth Sladen left the TV series. The finale of the film was to have taken place on a giant pinball table, with the Doctor, Harry and Sarah dodging balls as well as battling Daleks on the board. During his tenure as the Fourth Doctor, Baker repeatedly tried to attract funding for the film. At one point, he received substantial donations from fans, but after taking legal advice was forced to return them. The plans were eventually dropped.|$|E
5|$|Other {{proposals}} from Kelly and Giffords include {{limiting the}} sale of certain magazines, limiting {{the sale of}} assault weapons, and stopping gun trafficking. Mark Kelly was denied the sale of an AR-15 rifle. The shop owner denied Mr. Kelly the purchase stating his disagreement with Mr. Kelly's previous statements on gun laws. Local news reports that Mr. Kelly tried to buy the firearm using his Texas drivers license and thus could not prove Arizona residency. Mr. Kelly had stated that he was purchasing in order to turn the weapon in to the police department. In April 2013, Kelly was photographed at his mother-in-law's house in Arizona, with Giffords watching and cheering him on while he used a Glock 9 millimeter <b>for</b> <b>target</b> practice. The gun belongs to Giffords--she owned it prior to the 2011 attempt on her life. It is {{the same type of}} gun that was used in the January 2011 shooting.|$|E
5|$|Seventy-four of the 273 {{personnel}} from Evans {{were killed in}} the collision, with the majority of these believed to have been asleep or trapped inside the bow section, which sank within minutes. Melbourne deployed her boats, life rafts, and lifebuoys, before carefully manoeuvring alongside the stern section of Evans, where both ships' crews used mooring lines to lash the ships together. Sailors from Melbourne dived from the flight deck into the water to rescue overboard survivors close to the carrier, while the carrier's boats and helicopters collected those farther out. All of the survivors were located within 12 minutes of the collision and rescued before half an hour had passed, although the search continued for fifteen more hours. After Evans stern was evacuated, it was cast off, while the carrier moved away to avoid damage. The stern did not sink, and was later recovered, stripped of parts, and sunk <b>for</b> <b>target</b> practice.|$|E

5|$|The United States Air Force, focused toward {{nuclear weapons}} and {{delivery}} of such munitions against static strategic targets had spent little effort in expanding its tactical capabilities {{since the end of}} the World War II. Operation Shed Light sought to rectify this by bringing together improved tactics and technology. The programs were subsequently centered on improved communication and navigation aids for all-weather and night flying, sensor equipment for seeing through clouds, foliage, and darkness, improved equipment and methods <b>for</b> <b>target</b> marking and battlefield illumination, and aircraft and tactics to utilize these developments. In the end, few of the programs would yield applicable results and most of the aircraft developed under its umbrella would largely fall into obscurity. The most applicable developments were those that could be mainstreamed such as the work done on navigation and communication and sensor equipment.|$|E
5|$|The {{synthesis}} of the heavy isotopes 294Lv and 295Lv could be accomplished by fusing the heavy curium isotope curium-250 with calcium-48. The cross section of this nuclear reaction would be about 1picobarn, {{though it is not}} yet possible to produce 250Cm in the quantities needed <b>for</b> <b>target</b> manufacture. After a few alpha decays, these livermorium isotopes would reach nuclides at the line of beta stability. Additionally, electron capture may also become an important decay mode in this region, allowing affected nuclei to reach the middle of the island. For example, 295Lv would alpha decay to 291Fl, which would undergo successive electron capture to 291Nh and then 291Cn which is expected {{to be in the middle}} of the island of stability and have a half-life of about 1200years, affording the most likely hope of reaching the middle of the island using current technology. A drawback is that the decay properties of superheavy nuclei this close to the line of beta stability are largely unexplored.|$|E
5|$|Walker {{resisted}} Kenney's {{proposals that}} the bombers conduct attacks from low level using bombs armed with instantaneous fuses. Kenney ordered Walker {{to try the}} fuses {{for a couple of}} months, so that data could be gained about their effectiveness; a few weeks later Kenney discovered that Walker had discontinued their use. In November, Kenney arranged for a demonstration attack on the SS Pruth, a ship that had sunk off Port Moresby in 1924 and was often used <b>for</b> <b>target</b> practice. After the attack Walker and Kenney took a boat out to the wreck to inspect the damage. As expected, none of the four bombs dropped had hit the stationary wreck, but the instantaneous fuses had detonated the bombs when they struck the water, so bomb fragments had torn holes in the sides of the ship. Walker reluctantly conceded the point. A few weeks later, Walker was shot down leading a daylight raid over Rabaul, an attack that Kenney had ordered to be conducted at night.|$|E
