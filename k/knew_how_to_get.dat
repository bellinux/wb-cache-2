25|$|The {{idea of the}} Pro Spectacular was {{inspired}} from Motorcycle Motocross Supercross. Professional only events held in indoor arenas with tracks that were built with greater difficulty to enthuse the spectators who were attracted by heavy television promotion. The intent, highly successful in the MX world was to turn MX from almost a strictly participatory sport into a sport that would have great appeal to spectators, who like in most team sports like baseball and football would pay entrance fees to watch. Like in Supercross the ABA restricted the event to pros eliminating the amateur and children classes and whenever possible held its Spectaculars indoors like in Supercross (this also reduced the politics inherent in deciding which track would hold a national in any given state) and invested heavily in television advertisements. Races where to be held on Friday nights and held to two hours in length. That could both could fit a television schedule and the attention span of an attending audience. This was to give BMX greater public exposure, most of which {{never even heard of}} BMX much less <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> involved which in turn would spark an up surge of the beginner classes at the local level. At the same time greater revenue could be obtain from the entrance fees, making the ABA less dependent on participation on the local level.|$|E
25|$|Before {{her next}} voyage, a {{virtually}} new crew had been signed on - {{of the crew}} of 47, only eight men {{had been on the}} previous voyage. This eight included Captain Grimstone and his three deck officers, the mate John Elliot, William Hickson the gun layer, two other gunners and the ship steward. On Friday 24 October, in the early afternoon the English Trader left the Thames for what would be her last voyage. By late afternoon she had reached Southend on Sea. Here the Thames estuary was wide enough for convoys to form up in relative safety. Convoy EC90 was made up of 20 ocean-going freighters, two or three coastal steamers and two Royal Navy destroyers, one of which was the ageing HMS Vesper. Convoy EC90 set off on its voyage in single file to start with, proceeding at a steady eight knots. For the English Trader this was close to her maximum speed with a crew who <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the best from her, which the new crew did not. The convoy's route took it up the east coast of England and around the top of Scotland and down into the Atlantic Ocean. The English Channel was far too hazardous for shipping convoys {{at this stage of the}} war. By 3 pm, the English Trader's troubles had begun. She had been running sluggishly, which had been noticed by the crew members from previous voyages. She was now a least a half a mile behind the bulk of the convoy and HMS Vesper was enquiring for the reasons for the poor speed of the ship. The speculation from the more experienced crew members was that the English Traders coal-fired boilers, which were forced draught fed, required the booster fans to be precisely set. It was agreed that the ill-experienced new crew and the new chief engineer were unable to accomplish this. The captain was told by the commodore aboard the Vesper that if she could not regain her position in the convoy by nightfall she should make for harbour at one of the east coast ports.|$|E
500|$|Jardine {{insisted on}} strict {{discipline}} from his players but in return {{he went to}} great lengths to look after them, such as organising dental treatment or providing champagne for his tired bowlers. Critics praised his skill in field placing, which was sometimes interpreted as panic when he made frequent changes if the batsmen were on top. He also displayed great physical courage, such as when he was struck by a ball hard enough to draw blood on the Bodyline tour, but refused to show pain before reaching the dressing room. On the same tour, he instructed his men not to be friendly or to socialise with the Australian players; Gubby Allen even claimed that Jardine instructed the team to hate the Australians. Robertson-Glasgow wrote that Jardine made thorough preparation for games in which he was captain, studying individual batsmen at great length to find weaknesses. He had very clear plans, judged the strengths and weaknesses of his teams and <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the best out of individual players. However, Robertson-Glasgow considered it a grave misjudgement to make Jardine captain of England, particularly given his known antipathy towards Australia. Pelham Warner described how Jardine [...] "was a master of tactics and strategy, and was especially adept in managing fast bowlers and thereby preserving their energy. He possessed a great capacity for taking pains, which, it has been said, is the mark of a genius... As a field tactician and selector of teams he was, I consider, surpassed by no one and equalled by few, if any." ...|$|E

Lech Wałęsa, the founder of Solidarity and the first post-Communist President of Poland, credited John PaulII with giving Poles the courage to demand change. According to Wałęsa, [...] "Before his pontificate, the world was divided into blocs. Nobody <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of Communism.

2500|$|In 1951, {{just four}} years after the {{invention}} of the [...] transistor by Bell Laboratories, the Allentown Plant was opened to manufacture the first transistors. Jack Morton was assigned to develop transistors for manufacture. He had been responsible for inventing and providing the military with microwave components during WWII and <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> an idea from the lab, into production, and into the field. He established a system of branch labs at several Western Electric plants, consisting of teams of Bell Labs scientists and engineers focused on production engineering and acting as liaison with their colleagues back in Murray Hill. Morton fine-tuned this approach at the new Western Electric plant in Allentown, Pa., which produced electronic devices and components for the Bell System. He set up a Bell Labs semiconductor development group there and put Eugene Anderson in charge.|$|E
2500|$|Orwig was the {{athletic}} director at Indiana University from 1961 to 1975. [...] He took over as athletic director in February 1961, ten months into a four-year NCAA probation. [...] On accepting the post, Orwig said: [...] "No strong athletic department has been built on fraud. [...] We'll never have {{a part of that}} as long as I am the director at Indiana University. [...] I know there have been mistakes made here, but I think they've been honest ones. [...] These are mistakes to be corrected." [...] In the 61 years preceding Orwig's arrival, Indiana had won 49 conference championships and seven NCAA championships. [...] During Orwig's 15 years, the Hoosiers won 37 Big Ten championships in seven sports and six NCAA titles including a tie for the Big Ten football title in 1967 and a Rose Bowl appearance. [...] Home football attendance at Indiana averaged 25,854 the year before Orwig arrived, and by 1969 it had more than doubled to 53,319. [...] Orwig also guided the expansion of the school's athletic facilities, including the Assembly Hall basketball facility. [...] Among the coaches hired by Orwig were John Pont in football and Bobby Knight in basketball. [...] Bobby Knight said of Orwig: [...] "Bill Orwig, {{the athletic}} director who hired me, was a man of exceptional intelligence and class who <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> along with people and work with coaches. He had a great arrogance, in a positive way—he knew he was damned good at what he did. [...] I think more than anybody else in the school's history, Bill Orwig developed Indiana's athletic program into a major league operation—facilities, teams, coaches. [...] Sam Bell was a nationally respected track coach. Doc Counsilman {{was one of the great}} coaches of all time; John Pont took a team to the Rose Bowl; and Jerry Yeagley started the soccer program and built it from nothing into the best one going. [...] The architect of all that, Bill Orwig, is in the college athletic directors hall of fame." [...] He was also one of the founders and the first president from 1969-1970 of the National Athletic Directors of America.|$|E
