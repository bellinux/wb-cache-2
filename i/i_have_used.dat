500|$|Dworkin's {{short fiction}} and novels often {{incorporated}} elements from {{her life and}} themes from her nonfiction writing, sometimes related by a first-person narrator. Critics have sometimes quoted passages spoken by characters in Ice and Fire as representations of Dworkin's own views. cf. Dworkin, however, wrote [...] "My fiction is not autobiography. I am not an exhibitionist. I do not show myself. I am not asking for forgiveness. I {{do not want to}} confess. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> everything I know—my life—to show what I believe must be shown {{so that it can be}} faced. The imperative at the heart of my writing—what must be done—comes directly from my life. But I do not show my life directly, in full view; nor even look at it while others watch." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{songs on}} So Beautiful or So What touch on {{subjects}} such as love, mortality, and faith. In terms of songwriting, Simon did not approach each new song with a theme; instead, he let them evolve naturally from the first line he would compose. Simon {{had no plans to}} pursue religious writing, but it ended up particularly strong in the album’s lyrics. He noted that [...] "five of the first six" [...] songs he wrote touched on themes of God: [...] "I wondered whether there was a subconscious theme that I was tapping into. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> Christian symbols and imagery before in songs. It’s very strongly evocative, so it may just be coincidence—but it may not be." [...] The A.V. Club suggested that the album's gospel influence inspired the touch of humor when discussing dark {{subjects such as}} death.|$|E

500|$|Bacon later {{stated that}} [...] "painting {{has nothing to}} do with {{colouring}} surfaces", and in general he was not preoccupied with detailing his backgrounds: [...] "When I feel that I have to some extent formed the image, I put the background in to see how it's going to work and then I go with the image itself." [...] He told David Sylvester that he intended his [...] "hard, flat, bright ground" [...] to juxtapose with the complexity of the central images, and noted that [...] "for this work, it can work more starkly if the background is very united and clear. I think that probably is why <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> a very clear background against which the image can articulate itself". Bacon usually applied paint to the background quickly, and with [...] "great energy"; however, he thought of it as a secondary element. He used its colour to establish tone, but in his mind the real work began when he came to paint the figures.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the next}} three years he worked, alone and {{sometimes}} with the assistance of family members in his studio. [...] Even at that early stage of his career he was highly particular about his work; in an interview at that time he said [...] " [...] plates are nothing to me unless I get what I want. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> thirty of them at a sitting if I did not secure the effect to suit me." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the Imperial Japanese Navy was defeated, the Emperor called Yonai to his castle. The Emperor amiably invited Yonai to {{have lunch}} together. After that, the Emperor said, [...] "I really {{appreciated}} your reign and effort not to begin the war. I think {{we are not going}} to meet often like before". He put a pen and inkstone into a case and said, [...] "These are the things that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>used.</b> I would like to present this as a gift to you." [...] (Agawa, n.d.). This action is extremely rare because having presented the belongings of the Emperor is the supreme honor and the utmost expression of amiability.|$|E

2500|$|The {{idea of the}} Eagles {{transporting}} the Ring to Mount Doom, or {{at least}} part of the way, is not discussed in The Lord of the Rings and Tolkien himself apparently never specifically addressed it, except in an oblique manner. In The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien, he stated: [...] "The Eagles are a dangerous 'machine'. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> them sparingly, and that is the absolute limit of their credibility or usefulness. The alighting of a Great Eagle of the Misty Mountains in the Shire is absurd; it also makes the later capture of G. [...] by Saruman incredible, and spoils the account of his escape" [...] (Letter 210).|$|E
2500|$|Theyyam and Kathakali: Sivan said he {{received}} {{inspiration from the}} arts of his country: [...] "We have a rich visual culture and even in Ananthabhadram, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> certain aspects from Theyyam dancers and Kathakali to create the wizard Digambaran's image. The colour, long nails, kohl-lined eyes and so on were inspired from Theyyam and Kathakali." [...] The sequence between Manoj K Jayan using Riya Sen as a channel for black magic, choreographed by Aparna Sindhoor, the dance director of the film, uses Kathakali movements in particular, which has been an inspiration for major Indian films like director Shaji Karun's Vanaprastham (1999) and director Adoor Gopalakrishnan's Kalamandalam Ramankutty Nair (2005).|$|E
2500|$|This is {{the first}} time I have felt that I could take the time to write and also that I had {{anything}} to say to anything except my manuscript book. You remember that I had an idea that I was going to write the autobiography of a Communist ... There lay the trouble. I had planned to write a journalistic account of a strike. But as I thought of it as fiction the thing got bigger and bigger. It couldn't be that. I've been living with this thing for some time now. I don't know how much I have got over, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> a small strike in an orchard valley as the symbol of man's eternal, bitter warfare with himself.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the nature}} of her songwriting, Amos stated: [...] "My songs might be confessional, but I don’t like giving away too many details. One of the reasons I’ve made ten albums and {{maintained}} my family life is that I respect my own privacy." [...] She confessed, [...] "At times, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> made-up characters to keep the media at bay." [...] During an interview, she commented: [...] "I guess the girl that released Little Earthquakes was not a mother, {{and she was in}} her 20's, {{and there were a lot}} of things that she really did discover. She found her voice...and then nine records later, the woman who is putting out Abnormally Attracted to Sin knows what she did with her voice." ...|$|E
2500|$|Design of {{the theatre}} {{was given to}} C. J. Phipps. The {{builders}} were Patman and Fotheringham. Plans were drawn up and executed with speed and efficiency. Nonetheless, the advertised opening date {{had to be put}} back several times while the innovative electrical work was completed. The Savoy finally opened on 10 October 1881. Carte had at one time intended to call it the Beaufort Theatre, but he announced in a letter to The Daily Telegraph in 1881, [...] "On the Savoy Manor there was formerly a theatre. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> the ancient name as an appropriate title for the present one." [...] The exterior of the building was made from red brick and Portland stone. The interior decoration, by Collinson and Locke, was [...] "in the manner of the Italian Renaissance", with white, pale yellow and gold predominating, including a gold satin curtain (instead of the usual printed act-drop), red boxes and dark blue seats. There were none of the cherubs, deities and mythical creatures familiar from the décor of rival theatres. Carte wanted nothing that would appear too garish or gaudy to his target, middle-class audience.|$|E

But if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> {{a weaker}} acid or a worse {{conductor}} in the volta-electrometer, then {{the number of}} plates which would produce the most advantageous effect would have risen; or if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> a better conductor than that really employed in the volta-electrometer, <b>I</b> might <b>have</b> reduced the number even to one; as, for instance, when a thick wire is used to complete the circuit (865., &c.). And the cause of these variations is very evident, when it is considered that each successive plate in the voltaic apparatus does not add anything to the quantity of transferable power or electricity which the first plate can put into motion, provided a good conductor be present, but tends only to exalt the intensity of that quantity, {{so as to make}} it more able to overcome the obstruction of bad conductors (994. 1158.).|$|R
