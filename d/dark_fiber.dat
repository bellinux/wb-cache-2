5|$|Polled Dorsets are a {{medium-sized}} sheep that are long lived and prolific, heavy milkers. They produce hardy lambs with moderate growth and maturity that yield heavily muscled carcasses. Their fleece is very white, strong, close, free from <b>dark</b> <b>fiber</b> and extends down the legs. When shorn, fleece averages {{between five and}} nine pounds (2.23 to 4kg) in ewes and fifty to seventy percent of their fleece can be used. The staple length ranges from 2.5 to 4 inches (6 to 10cm) with a numeric count of 46's-58's. The fiber diameter ranges from 27.0 to 33.0 microns. At maturity, ewes weigh between 150 and 200 pounds (67 to 91kg), some weighing more in show condition. Mature rams range in weight from 225 to 275 pounds (102 to 125kg). Dorsets are noted {{for their ability to}} be bred more than once per year and are commonly used in crossbreeding to produce females for out-of-season breeding. They {{are one of the few}} breeds that have this characteristic. Multiple births are common and they work well in commercial operations, including programs where rams are specifically used to sire lambs for slaughter. These rams are known as terminal sires since their genetics are more suitable for slaughter than breeding purposes.|$|E

These results mean the crosstalk from public networks can increase the bit error rate in the QKD system, and imply an underlying information leakage through an adjacent covered-fiber.

40|$|Muscle fibers {{that power}} {{swimming}} in the blue crab Callinectes sapidus are < 80 μm in diameter in juveniles but grow hypertrophically, exceeding 600 μm in adults. Therefore, intracellular diffusion distances become progressively greater as the animals grow and, in adults, vastly exceed those in most cells. This developmental trajectory makes C. sapidus an excellent model for characterization {{of the influence of}} diffusion on fiber structure. The anaerobic light fibers, which power burst swimming, undergo a prominent shift in organelle distribution with growth. Mitochondria, which require O 2 and rely on the transport of small, rapidly diffusing metabolites, are evenly distributed throughout the small fibers of juveniles, but in the large fibers of adults they are located almost exclusively at the fiber periphery where O 2 concentrations are high. Nuclei, which do not require O 2, but rely on the transport of large, slow-moving macromolecules, have the inverse pattern: they are distributed peripherally in small fibers but are evenly distributed across the large fibers, thereby reducing diffusion path lengths for large macromolecules. The aerobic <b>dark</b> <b>fibers,</b> which power endurance swimming, have evolved an intricate network of cytoplasmically isolated, highly perfused subdivisions that create the short diffusion distances needed to meet the high aerobic ATP turnover demands of sustained contraction. However, fiber innervation patterns are the same in the <b>dark</b> and light <b>fibers.</b> Thus the <b>dark</b> <b>fibers</b> appear to have disparate functional units for metabolism (fiber subdivision) and contraction (entire fiber). Reaction-diffusion mathematical models demonstrate that diffusion would greatly constrain the rate of metabolic processes without these developmental changes in fiber structure...|$|R

5000|$|In January 2000, Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling {{announced}} to analysts {{that they were}} going to open trading for their own [...] "high-speed fiber-optic networks that form the backbone for Internet traffic". Investors quickly bought Enron stock following the announcement [...] "as they did with most things Internet-related at the time", with stock prices rising from $40 per share in January 2000 to $70 per share in March, peaking at $90 in the summer of 2000. Enron executives obtained windfall gains from the rising stock prices, with a total of $924 million of stocks sold by high-lever Enron employees between 2000 and 2001. Head of Enron Broadband Services, Kenneth Rice, sold 1 million shares himself, earning about $70 million in returns. As prices of existing fiber optic cables plummeted due to the vast oversupply of the system, with only 5% of the 40 million miles being active wires, Enron purchased the inactive [...] "dark fibers", expecting to buy them for cheap and then score a profit as the need for more usage by internet providers increased, with Enron expecting to lease its acquired <b>dark</b> <b>fibers</b> in 20 year contracts to providers. However, Enron's accounting would use estimates to determine how much their <b>dark</b> <b>fibers</b> would be worth when they were [...] "lit" [...] and apply those estimates to their current income, adding exaggerated revenue to their accounts since transactions were not yet made and it was not known if the cables would ever be active.

40|$|Abstract — We {{propose a}} novel hybrid optical {{wireless}} access network architecture {{that is designed}} for highly populated metropolitan area. This hybrid access network consists of an optical grid network providing broadband backhauling, and many wireless mesh networks penetrating into the neighborhoods to provide low cost, ubiquitous links. This hybrid access network architecture is scalable and flexible enough to easily meet varying demands for bandwidth of end users: As bandwidth demand increases, {{the capacity of the}} hybrid access network can be upgraded by deploying more access points in the wireless mesh network until its performance begins to degrade due to high hop-counts. As the performance degrade occurs, additional fiber are deployed (or <b>dark</b> <b>fibers</b> activated) to enhance the overall network capacity. On the optical grid backhauling network, we propose a hierarchical loop routing protocol to enhance the routing efficiency. Intra-cell hybrid adaptive routing protocols and algorithms are proposed to achieve the optimum network performance provided by this hybrid access network...|$|R

MDF panels obtained in critical refining condition showed <b>darker</b> <b>fibers</b> and cell walls transversely broken and lower resistance to internal bond, surface soundness, withdrawal of screws and swelling in thickness.
