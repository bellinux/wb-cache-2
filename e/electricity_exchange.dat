40|$|Capacity {{of supply}} {{is a crucial}} matter in {{electricity}} markets as it directly influences reliability of supply, price volatility and blackout risk. In this paper, we analyse the dynamics of capacity expansion in the Swiss electricity market {{and the impact of}} different policies such as nuclear phaseout and management of <b>electricity</b> <b>exchanges</b> - imports and exports - policies. This article develops the conceptualization model presented in [Ochoa, P., 2007 b. Policy changes in the Swiss electricity market: a system dynamics analysis of likely market responses. Socio-Economic Planning Sciences 41 (4) : 336 - 349. ]. We build a system dynamics model based on the dynamics of capacity expansion explained in the latter paper and present and analyse different scenarios. We conclude that international <b>electricity</b> <b>exchanges</b> are important for the Swiss market as they help to lower costs and to increase the income of the utility companies; however, we illustrate the need for explicit policies for managing imports and exports of electricity to avoid import dependence from neighbouring countries.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we derive power futures prices from a two-factor spot model being a {{generalization}} {{of the classical}} Schwartz–Smith commodity dynamics.

The spot and futures price models are fitted jointly, including the market price of risk parameterized from an Esscher transform. We apply this model to price call and put options on power futures. It is argued theoretically that the pricing measure for options may be different to the pricing measure of futures from spot in power markets due to the non-storability of the electricity spot.

This interconnection would allow to serve peak demand in the Baja California system with generation resources from the SIN. Conversely, in period of low demand in Baja California, surplus electricity and base load (i.e. geothermal and combined cycles) could be exported to the SIN. As a result, {{there would be a}} reduction of investment costs in generation infrastructure and of total production costs. In addition, the interconnection would open new opportunities for <b>electricity</b> <b>exchanges</b> with power utilities in Western United States through the existing transmission links with California.

40|$|Climate change induces various {{direct and}} {{indirect}} impacts. Among the direct effects are the likely rise {{in the frequency of}} heat waves and droughts in Europe. These immediate effects of climate change, in turn, cause downstream effects. Drought-induced water scarcity and lack in water supply affect further sectors and critical infrastructures. A lack in water supply for cooling purposes, for example, will negatively affect the electricity generation in power plants. In this paper we analyze the consequences of climate-change related impacts on such interplays between climate-change affected sectors. More specifically, we investigate how <b>electricity</b> <b>exchanges</b> between countries in Europe are affected and threatened by climate change because of the higher risk of water supply shortages due to more frequent drought and heat-wave incidences.

40|$|Thanks to {{its huge}} water storage capacity, Norway has {{an excess of}} energy {{generation}} at annual scale, although significant regional disparity exists. On average, the Mid-Norway region has an energy deficit and needs to import more electricity than it exports. We show that this energy deficit can be reduced {{with an increase in}} wind generation and transmission line capacity, even in future climate scenarios where both mean annual temperature and precipitation are changed. For the considered scenarios, the deficit observed in winter disappears, i. e., when electricity consumption and prices are high. At the annual scale, the deficit behaviour depends more on future changes in precipitation. Another consequence of changes in wind production and transmission capacity is the modification of <b>electricity</b> <b>exchanges</b> with neighbouring regions which are also modified both in terms of average, variability and seasonality...|$|R

40|$|Electricity {{generation}} from {{renewable energy}} (RE) like sun, {{wind and water}} is a growing market worldwide. It supports climate protection and reduces the usage of fossil fuels. On the other hand, the in-feed of RE implies high requirements for the electricity transmission and distribution due to the volatile nature of RE. Therefore, the in-feed, transmission and distribution of electricity will gain in importance {{in the future and}} will make substantial grid expansion necessary. In addition, regions with a high availability of RE will play an important role for electricity generation in the future. In different projects it is evaluated how electricity generated by RE can be transported e. g. from North Africa (NA) to the load centers and industrial zones in South or Middle Europe. In this contribution, results of a study about the development of a pan-European-North African <b>electricity</b> <b>exchange</b> are presented. Hereby, possible developments in electricity generation in NA and the export to Europe are modeled and evaluated, current conditions of the transmission grids are analyzed and the need for an overlaying grid is addressed. Due to the high transmission power and the large distances to be covered, the high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission appears as the most promising technology to be used. Based on the results for <b>electricity</b> <b>exchange,</b> the required overlaying HVDC grid is designed and further detailed for the NA region...|$|E

40|$|More {{and more}} {{transmission}} planning has {{to cope with}} a multilateral context due to increased <b>electricity</b> <b>exchanges</b> between zones. Whereas investments are decided upon and approved at the zonal level, policy goals can be formulated at a higher supranational level. The zonal level, however, can have its own objectives or way to reach the policy goals. This is possibly conflicting with the supranational or other zones’ viewpoints. In this paper, different transmission investment planners are compared. Conflicting outcomes are observed. As a possible compromise a Pareto-planner is proposed. He maximizes overall welfare while guaranteeing that all zones can at least keep their initial level of welfare. These constraints ensure that the multilateral context is explicitly taken into account. All planners are modeled as bilevel optimization problems and solved using mixed-integer quadratic programming and genetic algorithm. The models are applied on a 3 -node and 14 -node example. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Photovoltaic powered {{distributed}} generation (PV-DG) is increasingly being embedded into electricity distribution networks worldwide with fast penetration rates.
