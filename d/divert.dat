However, there are no data {{about the effects of}} <b>diverting</b> ileostomy on the outcomes of laparoscopic LAR Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 77 consecutive rectal cancer patients who had undergone laparoscopic LAR with (n = 23) or without (n = 54) <b>diverting</b> ileostomy.

40|$|Purpose: A <b>diverting</b> stoma {{is known}} to reduce the {{consequences}} of distal anastomotic failure following colorectal sur-gery. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the efficacy of a <b>diverting</b> stoma after an ultra-low anterior resection (uLAR) for rectal cancer. Methods: Between 2000 and 2007, 836 patients who underwent an uLAR were divided into two groups, depending on the fecal diversion: 246 received fecal diversion, and 590 had no diversion. Patient- and disease-related variables were com-pared between the two groups. Results: Thirty-two of the 836 patients (3. 8 %) had immediate anastomosis-related complications and required reopera-tion. Anastomosis leakage comprised 72 % of the complications (23 / 32). The overall immediate complication rate was sig-nificantly lower in patients with a <b>diverting</b> stoma (0. 8 %, 2 / 246) compared to those without a <b>diverting</b> stoma (5. 1 %, 30 / 590; P = 0. 005). The fecal diversion group had lower tumor location, lower anastomosis level, and more preoperative chemo-radiation therapy (P < 0. 001). In total, 12 % of patients in the <b>diverting</b> stoma group had complications either in making or reversing the stoma (30 / 246). Conclusion: The <b>diverting</b> stoma decreased the rate of immediate anastomosis-related complications. However, the rate of complications associated with the <b>diverting</b> stoma was non-negligible, so strict criteria should be applied when deciding whether to use a <b>diverting</b> stoma...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} {{the use of}} diversion mechanism in matrix acidizing to increase the flow resistance in highly permeable regions due {{to the presence of}} polymer temporary plugs. In this study, three polymers, namely hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl guar (HPG), and xanthan gum were evaluated in the laboratory to determine the best <b>diverting</b> agent to enhance the performance of matrix acidizing. An acidizing system was set-up using coreflooding techniques where Berea sandstone cores saturated with Sarapar were damaged by oil-based mud. Treatment fluids used were mud acid (3 % HF – 12 % HCl), HCl, polymer gels, and ethylene glycol monobutyl ether (EGMBE) as the mutual solvent. Polymer solutions were prepared at 40 lb/Mgal (4793 ppm) as per field formulation. The experimental results revealed that at low injection pressure, mud acid without <b>diverting</b> agents furnished the best performance where the improvement ratio achieved was 4. 88 at 50 psi (344. 7 kPa), compared with improvement ratio of 2. 42 for HEC, 2. 66 for HPG, and 1. 35 for xanthan gum. However, at higher injection pressure, mud acid with <b>diverting</b> agents gave better results, where at injection pressure of 100 psi (689. 5 kPa), mud acid with HEC <b>diverting</b> agent produced the best result with improvement ratio of 4. 88 compared to 1. 80 for mud acid without <b>diverting</b> agents. Generally, at low injection pressure, mud acid is found to stay longer in the core and has sufficient time to dissolve mud particles. Nevertheless, low injection pressure produces insufficient force to push acid deeper into the formation and fails to dissolve the viscous <b>diverting</b> agents completely. At high injection pressure, there is sufficient force for the acid to dissolve mud particles and viscous <b>diverting</b> agents, hence the <b>diverting</b> agents served its purpose by <b>diverting</b> the mud acid into low permeability zone...|$|R
