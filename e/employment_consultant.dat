40|$|The Welfare-to-work policy, {{implemented}} in July 2006 by the Federal Government, imposed {{a new work}} and activity obligation on people applying for the Disability Support Pension.

The new system offers greater opportunity for tailoring services to individual needs but falls short of a "best practice" model due to two major deficiencies. First, retention of Welfare to Work imposes participation requirements, is disempowering, risks detrimental impacts on mental health and impedes effective relationships between <b>employment</b> <b>consultants</b> and job seekers. Second, the absence of policies to stimulate labour demand in favour of concentrating on supply-side policies will hamper the ability of this cohort to obtain and retain employment...|$|R

50|$|The {{novel is}} set in Melbourne. The first-person narrator, Eddie Harnovey, is a Chemical Engineer, married to Tanya, an {{aspiring}} but ultimately uncontracted Political Science academic. Eddie is from middle class origins, his father being a clerk for a local council. His childhood friend Amanda, however, was a class above them. As a Chemical Engineer, her father wore starched cotton shirts while Eddie's father wore drip-dry poly-cotton shirts. Amanda's family banned Eddie from meeting her. Nevertheless, Eddie meets Amanda every nine and half years. The next time is as undergraduates, where Eddie notices her in a queue for more fashionable food than {{he is in the}} queue for. The next time is as fellow shoppers in a department store, as Eddie looks for formal wear for his marriage to Tanya. The next time he meets her is in much straitened circumstances. Downsized, jobless, and with only three dollars in his bank account, Eddie skips an appointment with Amanda - now an <b>employment</b> <b>consultant</b> - and ends up beaten unconscious protecting a friend of a now indigent man Eddie befriended while still solvent.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the ways in which}} workplace supports are conceptualized and implemented by four organizations that provide supported employment services. Data were collected during 2 -day site visits at each organization. Site visits included observations at a total of 39 work sites, semistructured interviews with a total of 126 primary stakeholders (supported employees, coworkers, employers/supervisors, and agency employment staff), document analysis (e. g., program descriptions, training and marketing materials), and a brief written survey about supported employment beliefs and practices. The findings indicate that each agency was driven by strong leadership and a cohesive vision and values. Each organization had a history of innova-tion and change. Staff were generally well trained, committed, and professional, and worked collaboratively {{with each other and with}} businesses. The involvement of work-place (or natural) supports was promoted in each organization, but there were a wide variety of interpretations and practices among staff. This article highlights areas with which these organizations struggle, including serving people with high support needs, developing a strong emphasis on person-centered approaches to planning and service delivery, assisting staff to facilitate workplace supports and social relationships, actively involving job seekers in the job search process, and increasing work hours and respon-sibilities of supported employees. ince the beginning of supported employment, integration has been a defining feature of good prac-tice. Both physical and social integration have been considered critical aspects of supported employment. Job coaches or <b>employment</b> <b>consultants</b> have also been a core feature of supported employ-ment. In recent years, the concept of natural supports has emerged, focusing on the importance of adhering to the typical norms and practices of work-places and tapping supports that exist or can be developed within workplaces.

40|$|This study {{addresses}} organizational direction {{form the}} perspective of organizational strategy. It explores {{the factors that influence}} realized strategy and especially the degree to which realized strategy is deliberate or emergent. A model is offered that proposes both direct and indirect factors as determinants of realized strategy. Specific direct and indirect factors are hypothesized and the relationships are statistically examined. ^ The sample is composed of twenty nonprofit organizations with a primary base of operations in southern New England. Data was collected for multiple respondents within each organization representing the various levels of management. Most participating organizations were mid-sized, social service agencies. ^ The results of the study indicate that the level of comprehensiveness of the organization 2 ̆ 7 s strategic plan, modified by perceived instability in the external environment explains a significant amount of the variance in realized strategy. The primary determinant of the variance, however, is the level of organizational control from both formal and informal sources. These strong organizational controls are the primary determinant of the deliberate versus emergent nature of realized strategy. ^ There was very little significant support for any of the individual, organizational, or contextual factors that might contribute in an indirect way to realized strategy, however the proportion of business executives {{on the board of directors}} led to a significantly more comprehensive strategic decision making process. The strength of organizational controls also positively influenced that process. The <b>employment</b> of <b>consultants</b> did not have any significant impact on any part of the strategic process or on the nature of realized strategy.

40|$|This paper {{explains}} {{the proliferation of}} consulting activities in nonprofit organizations, and illustrates it by {{a study of the}} external consultancies commissioned by one religious/charitable organization (RCO) within a twelve-month period. The qualitative study, conducted over one year, identifies the <b>employment</b> of external <b>consultants</b> as one manifestation of normative institutional pressures on nonprofit organizations to adopt corporate-style accounting and management practices. Within the nonprofit sector, there is scope for further research on the challenges involved for organizations in that sector as they attempt to analyse the pressures of the institutional environment in which they operate and assess the applicability of corporate practices recommended by consultants. While some research has been undertaken on consultancies in both the public and nonprofit sectors, there has been less attention paid to its role in the infiltration of corporate practices from the private sector, through the public sector, and into the nonprofit sector. By focusing on the institutional environment in which nonprofit organizations operate, and on one organization, insights have been provided about this process...|$|R
40|$|A key {{recommendation}} of consumer organizations and governments {{has been the}} <b>employment</b> of consumer <b>consultants</b> in inpatient psychiatric facilities, but the attitudes of mental health clinicians towards this measure remain inconsistent. The aims {{of this study were}} to examine mental health clinicians' attitudes about the role of mental health consumer consultants in inpatient psychiatric units, and to ascertain if participants' age, type of inpatient unit, or grade of staff influenced their attitudes towards consultants. The Consumer Participation and Consultant Questionnaire was used, which was adapted from the Mental Health Consumer Participation Questionnaire. A convenience sample of 47 mental health professionals from two adult inpatient psychiatric units located in a large Australian public general hospital participated in the study. The findings, overall, showed that participants supported the inclusion of consumer consultants in psychiatric units in areas that indirectly impinged on their current roles. Age, level of nurses, and place of employment did not affect their beliefs, but type of occupation was influential. Nurses were less supportive of aspects of consumer consultants' roles that overlapped with the traditional roles of the nurse. The findings have implications for clinical practice, education, and further research, and these are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Contractor {{selection}} {{models have}} been developed for large scale works with the assumption of the availability of contractor’s information for the clients. However, a similar study of small building works, especially building maintenance and repair works, is almost ignored. In light of the small amount of work, the <b>employment</b> of building <b>consultants</b> for the selection of contractors in small works is often not feasible, and the cost of acquiring the contractor’s information is often prohibitively high. This research uses case studies to show that a contractor selection model for large scale works does not perform well in small works without the advice of the consultant. The high proportion of specification costs in small works contracting deters the detailed design and documentation stage. A wider variation of tender sums is therefore expected and revealed in the case studies. This paper reviews the building procurement mechanism in small building works in Hong Kong and argues that the employment of a property management agent is conducive to the contractor selection process. Accordingly, further investigations are warranted for a contractor selection model for small building works. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|R
