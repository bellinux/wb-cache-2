5|$|Boletus auripes, {{commonly}} known as the butter-foot bolete, is a species of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae. First described from New York in 1898, the fungus is found in eastern Asia, Central America, and eastern North America <b>from</b> <b>Canada</b> <b>to</b> Florida. It is a mycorrhizal species and typically grows in association with oak and beech trees.|$|E
5|$|In the Atlantic Ocean, the {{greatest}} concentration of loggerheads is along the southeastern coast of North America {{and in the}} Gulf of Mexico. Very few loggerheads are found along the European and African coastlines. Florida {{is the most popular}} nesting site, with more than 67,000 nests built per year. Nesting extends as far north as Virginia, as far south as Brazil, and as far east as the Cape Verde Islands. The Cape Verde Islands are the only significant nesting site on {{the eastern side of the}} Atlantic. Loggerheads found in the Atlantic Ocean feed <b>from</b> <b>Canada</b> <b>to</b> Brazil.|$|E
5|$|S. t. tristis is {{the most}} common of the subspecies. Its summer range is <b>from</b> {{southern}} <b>Canada</b> <b>to</b> Colorado, and east to the Carolinas. Its winter range is <b>from</b> southern <b>Canada</b> south <b>to</b> Florida and central Mexico.|$|R

5|$|The Chadian {{team for}} the 2004 Athens Games {{featured}} sprinter Kaltouma Nadjina in the women's 400 metres, who had previously competed for the nation at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Nadjina had trained in the United States and Canada, under an International Olympic Committee scholarship. But after refusing to move <b>from</b> <b>Canada</b> <b>to</b> Senegal following the 2000 Games, she lost her funding, and lived in a spare room of her coach John Cannon's house in Vancouver. Prior to the 2004 Games, she had considered switching her allegiance from Chad to Canada.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} the final link {{in what was then}} called the Pacific Highway (later known as U.S. Route 99), which ran <b>from</b> <b>Canada</b> <b>to</b> Mexico. The bridge crosses the Lake Union section of the Lake Washington Ship Canal and, unlike earlier bridges across the canal, the height of the Aurora Bridge {{eliminated}} the need for a drawbridge. The Seattle City Council voted to build connecting portions of the highway through the Woodland Park Zoo, a decision which generated considerable controversy at the time.|$|E
5|$|The fungus {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in Europe, Central and North America, temperate Asia, and Turkey. In North America, its range extends <b>from</b> <b>Canada</b> <b>to</b> the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt south of Mexico City. The mushroom is common, {{appearing in the}} summer and autumn, although it is easily overlooked because of its small size and nondescript coloration. A.vulgare is the only representative of its genus in temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere.|$|E

He once drove <b>from</b> <b>Canada</b> <b>to</b> Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania hoping to find a ride in an event, but he went empty-handed. He bypassed the series when he was offered a full-time ride in a United States Automobile Club sprint car for 1964.|$|E

The episode cost $10 million to produce, {{making it one of}} the most expensive pilots in television history. Following the pilot's filming, production for the series moved to New York. The producers were forced to hire a new cow for the remainder of the season because they were not allowed to travel the original cow <b>from</b> <b>Canada</b> <b>to</b> New York. Production team members noted that they were prepared to paint new cows if viewers noted the differences in spots.|$|E

5|$|An initial {{attempt to}} bring a {{professional}} ice hockey team to Nottingham was made in 1939 following {{the completion of the}} Ice Stadium in Nottingham City Centre. A team was assembled and brought to the United Kingdom <b>from</b> <b>Canada</b> <b>to</b> compete in the 1939–40 English National League season but were promptly sent home having not played a single game due to the outbreak of World War II. Seven years later, after the war had ended, a second effort to bring ice hockey to the city was begun. With a team of Canadians largely from Winnipeg, Manitoba, the Nottingham Panthers played their first competitive game on 22 November 1946 with a 3–2 home victory over the Wembley Monarchs.|$|E
5|$|Carlo Alberto {{acted as}} the royal yacht for King Victor Emmanuel III when he {{attended}} the coronation ceremony for King Edward VII of the United Kingdom in 1902. Victor Emmanuel invited Guglielmo Marconi to accompany him and conduct radio experiments en route. When the coronation was delayed by Edward's illness, the ship took Victor Emmanuel to meetings with Tsar Nicholas II of Russia in Kronstadt. She then ferried Marconi across the Atlantic to Nova Scotia for experiments transmitting radio messages across the ocean. After 15 December, when Marconi successfully transmitted messages <b>from</b> <b>Canada</b> <b>to</b> England, Carlo Alberto was sent to Venezuelan waters during the Venezuelan crisis of 1902–03, when an international force of British, German, and Italian warships blockaded Venezuela over the country's refusal to pay foreign debts. From 1907 to 1910 she served as a gunnery and torpedo training ship.|$|E
5|$|Horses {{have been}} present in the American West since the 1500s, when they arrived with Spanish explorers. Many escaped, were {{released}} by the Spanish or stolen by Native Americans. Their descendents crossed with horses who escaped from or were released by other European settlers, including draft breeds brought by farmers and wagoneers and lighter riding horses brought by the United States Cavalry. Horses of French descent also moved across the border <b>from</b> <b>Canada</b> <b>to</b> contribute to the herds. The mixture of these breeds created the Mustang present in the western portion of the US today. By the early 1970s, {{it was assumed that}} due to crossbreeding, the original Spanish stock had been eliminated from feral herds. In 1971, the Wild and Free-Roaming Horse and Burro Act was passed, giving the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) the authority to manage the feral horse populations in the American West.|$|E

5|$|In May 1932, Kalep {{traveled}} from France to New York on the steamship SS Paris {{with the intention}} of flying back to Europe across the Atlantic Ocean; at the time, no woman had made a solo transatlantic flight. She befriended American aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart, who, unbeknownst to Kalep, was planning a similar feat. After Earhart's successful flight <b>from</b> <b>Canada</b> <b>to</b> Ireland on 20 May, Kalep decided {{that it would not be}} worthwhile to make her own attempt at flying across the Atlantic, since she would no longer be the first woman to do so. She continued to encourage other women to enter the field of aviation, however, and became a member of the Ninety-Nines, an international organisation for women pilots which was founded by Earhart and 98 other female aviators. In August 1932, Kalep planned to fly with Roger Q. Williams from Los Angeles to Athens to celebrate the former city's hosting of the 1932 Summer Olympics, but their flight was canceled. Soon after, it was reported that Kalep had remarried to W. E. Hutton-Miller, an American stockbroker.|$|E
5|$|Tylopilus plumbeoviolaceous is a {{mycorrhizal}} species, and {{the bulk}} of the fungus lives underground, associating in a mutualistic relationship with the roots of various tree species. The fruit bodies are found growing singly, scattered or clustered together during mid-summer to autumn in deciduous forests, often under beech or oak trees; however, it sometimes occurs in mixed hardwood-conifer forests under hemlock. A preference for sandy soil has been noted in one source. In North America, the mushroom can be found east of the Rocky Mountains, ranging <b>from</b> <b>Canada</b> <b>to</b> Mexico. The species has also been collected in North Korea. Fruit bodies can serve as a food source for fungus-feeding Drosophila flies.|$|E
5|$|By 1962, the American {{government}} was becoming increasingly concerned {{at the lack}} of a commitment <b>from</b> <b>Canada</b> <b>to</b> take nuclear weapons. The interceptors and Bomarc missiles with which Canada was being supplied as a NORAD member were either of no use or of greatly diminished utility without nuclear devices. Canadian and American military officers launched a quiet campaign to make this known to the press, and to advocate for Canadian agreement to acquire the warheads. Diefenbaker was also upset when Pearson was invited to the White House for a dinner for Nobel Prize winners in April, and met with the President privately for 40 minutes. When the Prime Minister met with retiring American Ambassador Livingston Merchant, he angrily disclosed the paper Kennedy had left behind, and hinted that he might make use of it in the upcoming election campaign. Merchant's report caused consternation in Washington, and the ambassador was sent back to see Diefenbaker again. This time, he found Diefenbaker calm, and the Prime Minister pledged not to use the memo, and to give Merchant advance word if he changed his mind. Canada appointed a new ambassador to Washington, Charles Ritchie, who on arrival received a cool reception from Kennedy and found that the squabble was affecting progress on a number of issues.|$|E

5|$|The Grizzlies {{were the}} first NBA {{relocation}} since the Kansas City Kings relocated to Sacramento, California and became the Sacramento Kings in 1985. It was followed by two others in the same decade. The first was the relocation of the original Charlotte Hornets to New Orleans in 2002, with the team becoming the New Orleans Hornets (now Pelicans). (That relocation is no longer treated by the league as such; after the 2013–14 season, the franchise then known as the Charlotte Bobcats reclaimed the Hornets name and also received sole rights {{to the history of}} the Hornets in Charlotte.) The second was in 2008, when the Seattle SuperSonics relocated to become the Oklahoma City Thunder. In the NHL, two teams were moved <b>from</b> <b>Canada</b> <b>to</b> the U.S. during the mid-1990s: the Quebec Nordiques became the Colorado Avalanche in 1995, and the Winnipeg Jets became the Phoenix Coyotes in 1996 and were rebranded as the Arizona Coyotes in 2014 (a new Winnipeg Jets team returned to the city by relocation of the Atlanta Thrashers in 2011). In 2005, one of Canada's two Major League Baseball teams (the Montreal Expos) relocated to Washington, D.C. and became the Washington Nationals. The failure of the Vancouver franchise was part of the reason the NBA changed the expansion drafting rules following the return of Charlotte to the league as the Bobcats in 2005. The Bobcats were allowed to pick fourth in their first draft, and were later not restricted from first picks.|$|E
