30|$|From the {{perspectives}} of the image clarity evaluation function, the focus search algorithm, and the environmental adaptability of the algorithm, there are three research focuses in auto-focus system based on the image processing. They are as follows: to improve the measurement precision of the focusing system, to shorten the time of work, and to enhance its anti-interference ability. At present, the common auto-focus searching algorithms include the hill-climbing algorithm, <b>Fibonacci</b> <b>searching</b> algorithm, and the curve fitting algorithm [10, 11]. Among those algorithms, the hill-climbing algorithm with the inspired selective characteristic has been widely used {{to search for the}} best focus point in practical application. However, the hill-climbing search algorithm can only provide the relative indicators of the image sharpness, and the sharpness evaluation is vulnerable to the noise interference, which can make the result appear to the local peaks.|$|R

Compared to binary search where the sorted array is divided into two equal-sized parts, one of which is examined further, <b>Fibonacci</b> <b>search</b> divides the array into two parts that have sizes that are consecutive Fibonacci numbers. On average, this leads to about 4% more comparisons to be executed, but it has the advantage that one only needs addition and subtraction to calculate the indices of the accessed array elements, while classical binary search needs bit-shift, division or multiplication, operations that were less common at the time <b>Fibonacci</b> <b>search</b> was first published. <b>Fibonacci</b> <b>search</b> has a average- and worst-case complexity of O(log n) (see Big O notation).|$|E

40|$|This paper gives eight replicating Fibonacci digits (repfigits) between 10 and 14 digits long. These {{numbers are}} {{believed}} to be previously unknown, as they exceed those listed by Pickover in [1]. This paper also describes two simple techniques that improved the search time from weeks to minutes and may be useful for solving similar problems in recreational mathematics. The concept of repfigits was introduced in [2] by Keith. Given a n digit number D, first generate the Fibonacci sequence which starts with the n digits and has each successive term the sum of the n previous terms. The number D is called a repfigit if D appears in the resulting sequence. For example, 197 is a repfigit, since 197 is in the Fibonacci sequence (1, 9, 7, 17, 33, 57, 107, 197, 361, [...] .). Table 1 lists all known repfigits of 14 digits or fewer. The 11 to 14 digit numbers are new results. There apparently are no 10 digit repfigits. The 2 to 9 digit results are from [1].

40|$|This {{study is}} about the scale up of {{biopolymer}} fermentation from 500 mL shake flasks to 2 L fermentor. The purpose of this project is to determine air flow rate at 2 L fermentor which gives the same kLa and kap as produced in shake flasks. The rationale of using the kLa value is to ensure a certain mass transfer capability in order {{to cope with the}} oxygen demand of the culture, thus being an important scale-up factor. Both values were derived by fitting the dissolved oxygen tension (DOT) versus time data into The <b>Fibonacci</b> Min <b>Search</b> (Fminsearch) method. Two values, which are 0. 2960 for volumetric mass transfer coefficient for oxygen (kLa) and 0. 0220 for the electrode mass transfer coefficient (kap) were obtained at small scale. These values are required to be duplicated in the larger scale. It was done by using a fixed agitation rate of 200 rpm and a manipulated aeration rate which is 1 L/min, 1. 5 L/min, 2 L/min and 1. 75 L/min. The most comparable kLa and kap values obtained from the trial are at 1. 75 L/min. This aeration rate will be used in the 2 L fermentor in order to investigate the production of poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB). Fermentation is run at both scales to compare the glucose, biomass and PHB profile. From the experiment and calculation, the maximum concentration of PHB is achieve at the 36 th hours, which is 1. 415 g/L for 500 mL shake flasks, and 2. 17 g/L for 2 L fermentor.

30|$|After {{evaluation}} of the image definition or quality, a search method is usually applied {{to find the best}} focusing position for image capture [10]. The most straightforward method is the global search, which obtain the optimal position by scanning through all possible focus positions in a unidirectional manner. It has high computation cost and is only applicable to the cases with narrow focus range. There are various search strategies proposed to speed the search and improve the accuracy in the literature [11 – 13]. Most of these search strategies can be classified into three categories: the binary search (BS), <b>Fibonacci</b> <b>search</b> (FS), and rule-based search (RS) [14]. In the binary search, the image definition evaluation function is computed at two locations and their difference is computed. If the difference is negative, the next move follows the opposite direction. Given the unimodal shape of the definition evaluation, the binary search can converge to the best focus location at a fast speed provided heuristic choices of the step magnitude. The hill-climbing search is a popular search strategy developed from the basic binary search, which divides the search procedures into two stages: out-of-focus region searching and focused region searching [15]. The hill-climbing search method has been improved with modifications with respect to the step-size selection, termination criteria, search window, etc. [11, 15]. The <b>Fibonacci</b> <b>search</b> is one of the well-known search strategies, which can narrow the search interval until its size equals a given fraction of the initial search range [16]. This method was further improved by combination of the <b>Fibonacci</b> <b>search</b> and the curve fitting method to avoid the local optimum disturbance [12]. A rule-based search was a sequential search method proposed to adjust the search step size by the distance from the best focus position [13]. This method can avoid the back and forth motor moving of the <b>Fibonacci</b> <b>search.</b> In [11], Liu et al. proposed a search method by combination of image definition evaluation function and modulation transfer function (MTF) auxiliary function to judge the search direction. Although the search method has been widely studied, how to obtain the best focusing position with high accuracy and low computation cost is still a challenging problem.|$|E
