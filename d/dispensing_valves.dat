40|$|The {{creation}} of three dimensional functional graded materials by powder processing methods requires {{the capability to}} arrange a sequence of two dimensional images that can be presented to a solid freeforming device. Planar stacking methods can only achieve a one dimensional gradient. We describe the acoustic control of powder metering and <b>dispensing</b> <b>valves</b> in which the flow rate and switching of powders from a capillary can be controlled using the frequency and amplitude of acoustic vibration from a computer sound card. An orchestra of such valves {{can be used to}} pattern layers of powder on the building platform which forms part of a 3 -axis table in the Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) process. Patterns and gradients were prepared using copper and steel powders...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} miniaturized, disposable, normally-closed {{electromagnetic}} dispensing valve for the microliter range to process 96 -well plates. The novel injection-molded valve {{is designed to}} fit into a 9 mm grid to realize an eight channel dispensing head, enabling the serial processing of well plates row-by-row. The presented dispensing valve design originates from a miniaturization study of a previously developed functional model. The outer diameter of the valve, including all actuating components, was reduced by 8 mm to an overall diameter of 8. 5 mm without compromising the performance. Additionally, the actuation current of the valve could be reduced to 5 A. The valve is characterized for a volume range between 840 nL and 5. 3 μL. The performance of the injection molded valve is competitive to commercially available <b>dispensing</b> <b>valves,</b> featuring the advantages of low fabrication costs, disposability, low mounting size, easy handling, and super silent actuation...|$|E
30|$|Liquid is {{introduced}} to the chamber using two different methods. A Genie™ Plus Syringe Pump (Kent Scientific Corporation, Connecticut, USA) is used to pump buffer through the chamber. The micro <b>dispensing</b> <b>valve</b> is used to introduce the sample {{of interest to the}} liquid line and is pressure driven. A compressed air regulator (Spectron Gas Control Systems GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany) provides the appropriate pressure in the 20 – 100  mbar regime and the desired volume is injected through controlling the opening time of the micro <b>dispensing</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|R
30|$|A {{three-way}} {{solenoid valve}} (ASCO Valve, Inc. Florham Park, NJ, USA) allows control {{over whether the}} liquid flows into the measurement chamber or whether it bypasses it using the priming outlet. The priming outlet is located between the measurement chamber and the two inlet ports. This outlet allows diverting bubbles and priming of the micro <b>dispensing</b> <b>valve</b> without introducing sample into the cantilever chamber before it is required.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the methods}} used to support land {{restoration}} lakes is the method of pulverizing aeration. Use of aerators powered exclusively by wind improves the condition of reservoirs, while not compromising the environment. The pulverizing aeration process drive is windy on the water aeration zone near bottom, while removing harmful gases anaerobic metabolism. Aerators of this type due to the unique method of operation also enable dosing of inactivation coagulants with oxygenated water to {{the depths of the}} lake. Mileage coagulant dosing can be made dependent on the speed of the wind, which has an impact on the performance of his work, because with the increase of wind speed <b>dispensing</b> <b>valve</b> coagulants should be stronger open. One {{of the methods}} for assessing the state of lakes is to measure water transparency. The softer visibility, the most likely state of the water is better. Dosage of coagulant so you can make the transparency of the water. Similarly, with increasing transparency water <b>dispensing</b> <b>valve</b> should be more covered up. Control of the drain valve dispenser coagulant can be simultaneously dependent on two factors. The study was designed method of control drain valve dispenser coagulant using fuzzy inference...|$|R

It allows ketchup to be dispensed more easily than was possible with the glass bottle, and permits the use of more of the ketchup in the bottle, as the contents will settle {{on top of the}} <b>dispensing</b> <b>valve.</b> The [...] "upside-down" [...] bottle is intended to be non-refillable. A similar bottle has been introduced in several different sizes at the retail/grocery level, but without the opaque red coloring.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} disposable, {{normally}} closed, non-contact <b>dispensing</b> <b>valve</b> for the sub-µL range. The miniaturized solenoid valve (diameter: 8 mm, height: 27. 25 mm) is compatible to standard Luer-Lock interfaces. A highly dynamic actuation principle enables opening times down to 1 ms. The dispensing performance was evaluated for water (η = 1. 03 mPas) and a 66 % (w/w) glycerol/water solution (η = 16. 98 mPas), at pressures varying from 200 to 800 mbar. The experimentally determined minimal dispensing volume was 163 nL (CV 1. 6 %) {{for water and}} 123 nL (CV 4. 5 %) for 66 % (w/w) glycerol/water. The low-cost polymer valve enables high precision dispensing of liquid volumes down to {{the lower end of}} the sub-µL range comparable to high-end non-disposable micro-dispensing valves...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a new milk dispenser product that is designed to dispense milk with varying levels of milk fat content. The product contains two tanks of milk, one containing skim and one containing whole. The user can rotate a dial to select which type of milk they want (skim, 1 %, 2 %, whole) and the product is able to mix the skim and whole milk at the appropriate ratio to dispense the desired type of milk. A prototype was developed that uses two, gallon-size milk jugs, each attached to a flexible tube at the cap interface. The flexible tubes passes through a ratio selection mechanism that the user can rotate to select the desired type of milk. The mechanism compresses the tubes to achieve the appropriate ratio, and finally the tubes pass on through to a <b>dispensing</b> <b>valve.</b> The prototype was tested using clear water in one tank, and colored water in the other to visually observe how well the product mixes. The final prototype was able to mix quite appropriate ratios with sufficient precision in milk fat ratios. by Julie E. Henion. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|The {{flow rate}} of powder {{in an open}} {{vertical}} capillary subject to transverse acoustic vibration is predicted using an explicit equation by considering the intermittent arrest and stasis of particles subject to acceleration in a field. The analysis rests solely on physical quantities that are easily measured by experiment. The calculation is supported by measured flow rate and by direct observation using high speed photography. Increasing the horizontal component of acceleration of a particle should not influence rate of descent but the overall time of flight is increased both by re-initiation of descent after collision at the wall and by fixed stationary periods on each cycle. Since flow stops when acoustic vibration stops, the vibrating tube is a valve that provides computer-controlled powder flow metering, mixing and <b>dispensing.</b> The <b>valve</b> is capable of adjusting the flow rate with a ratio of minimum to maximum flow rate of 0. 1. It {{is being used to}} make three-dimensional functional gradients by solid freeforming operations, notably selective laser sintering...|$|R
40|$|A 3 -axis {{dispensing}} {{system is}} utilized {{to control the}} initiating and terminating fiber positions and trajectory via the dispensing software. The polymer fiber length and orientation {{is defined by the}} spatial positioning of the dispensing system 3 -axis stages. The fiber diameter is defined by the prescribed dispense time of the <b>dispensing</b> system <b>valve,</b> the feed rate (the speed at which the stage traverses from an initiating to a terminating position), the gauge diameter of the dispensing tip, the viscosity and surface tension of the polymer solution, and the programmed drawing length. The stage feed rate affects the polymer solution’s evaporation rate and capillary breakup of the filaments. The dispensing system consists of a pneumatic valve controller, a droplet-dispensing <b>valve</b> and a <b>dispensing</b> tip. Characterization of the direct write process to determine the optimum combination of factors leads to repeatedly acquiring the desired range of fiber diameters. The advantage of this robotic dispensing system is the ease of obtaining a precise range of micron/sub-micron fibers onto a desired, programmed location via automated process control. Here, the discussed self-assembled micron/sub-micron scale 3 D structures have been employed to fabricate suspended structures to create micron/sub-micron fluidic devices and bioengineered scaffolds...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Patch-based transdermal drug {{delivery}} technology offers a convenient way to administer drugs without the drawbacks of standard hypodermic injections related to issues, such as patient acceptability and injection safety. In this paper, {{we developed a}} flexible and disposable microneedle-fluidic-system (MFS), which can achieve finger driven on-chip drug loading and delivery functions by integrating polydimethylsiloxane-based microfluidic <b>dispensing</b> networks, check <b>valves,</b> micropump, and SU- 8 microneedles in a patch device. The control of particular loading or delivery volume for drugs is provided in terms of finger pressing to a micropump with a given dimension. The in vitro mechanical testing, penetration testing, and delivery testing prove the device functionalities. The local inflammation phenomenon of rats has been ameliorated {{with the aid of}} successful diclofenac deliver by our MFS patch.
