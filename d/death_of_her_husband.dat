5|$|Charles' illness {{created a}} power vacuum that {{eventually}} led to the Armagnac–Burgundian Civil War between supporters of his brother, Louis of Orléans and the royal dukes of Burgundy. Isabeau shifted allegiances as she chose the most favorable paths for the heir to the throne. When she followed the Armagnacs, the Burgundians accused her of adultery with Louis of Orléans; when she sided with the Burgundians the Armagnacs removed her from Paris and she was imprisoned. In 1407 John the Fearless assassinated Orléans, sparking hostilities between the factions. The war ended soon after Isabeau's eldest son, Charles, had John the Fearless assassinated in 1419—an act that saw him disinherited. Isabeau attended the 1420 signing of the Treaty of Troyes, which decided that the English king should inherit the French crown after the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband,</b> Charles VI. She lived in English-occupied Paris until her death in 1435.|$|E

Catherine gradually introduced changes to {{the tradition}}al form of these entertainments. She forbade heavy tilting of the sort that led to the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> in 1559; and she developed and increased the prominence of dance in the shows that climaxed each series of entertainments. As a result, the ballets de cour, a distinctive new art form, emerged from the creative advances in court entertainment devised by Catherine de' Medici.|$|E

5|$|The final {{transition}} to a constitutional monarchy was made during the long reign of William IV's successor, Victoria.

In recognition of British rule over India, Victoria was declared Empress of India in 1876.
