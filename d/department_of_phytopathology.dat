Five treatments (0 / 100 / 200 / 400 / 800 ppm) were used with three repetitions of each, and four mutually perpendicular radii, were measured in centimeters from the mycelial center. The formula for the Mycelial Growth Index (MGI) was applied to the values obtained for statistical analyses. A 32 % reduction in the growth of B. sorokiniana was observed {{in the presence of the}} methanol extract, while the hexane extract was effective against both of the phytopathogens, resulting in a 49 % reduction in the growth of B. sorokiniana and an 18 % reduction in the growth of C. gloeosporioides...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Coffee {{is one of}} {{the main}} export {{commodities}} of Brazilian agribusiness. Phoma leaf spot [Phoma tarda (Stewart) Boerema & Bollen] {{is one of the}} most important coffee fungal diseases in Brazil. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the intensity of Phoma leaf spot in coffee seedlings supplied with different rates of Ca+ 2 and K+. The study was conducted under controlled conditions in a growth chamber, at the <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Phytopathology</b> - UFLA, from February 2010 to December 2011. The assay was repeated twice under the same conditions. The nutrient solutions consisted of five concentrations of K+ (3, 4, 5, 6, 7 mmol L- 1) and Ca+ 2 (2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 mmol L- 1). The experiment was arranged in a randomized block design, with 25 treatments and three replicates, with two plants per plot. The areas under incidence progress curve (AUIPC) and severity (AUSPC) were calculated. At the lowest rate of Ca 2 + (2 mmol L- 1) and highest K+ (6 and 7 mmol L- 1), approximately, the AUIPC was the smallest. For the AUSPC, the lowest rates of Ca+ 2 and K+ resulted in the lowest severities. Supply of Ca+ 2 and K+ in nutrient solution reduced AUIPC and AUSPC of Phoma leaf spot, and these nutrients can be recommended for the management of the disease...|$|E

Avaliou-se a fungitoxicidade dos extratos hexânico e metanólico do óleo copaíba por meio de ensaios biológicos contra os fitopatógenos Colletotrichum gloeosporioides e Bipolaris sorokiniana. Os referidos extratos foram escolhidos em razão dos melhores rendimentos obtidos na extração a frio. O material biológico foi obtido na UFLA no Departamento de Fitopatologia, repicado em meio de cultura BDA (C. gloeosporioides) e PCA (B. sorokiniana) e incubados em câmara de germinação com controle de temperatura e luz. Empregaram-se cinco tratamentos (0 / 100 / 200 / 400 / 800 ppm), realizando-se três repetições e avaliando-se quatro raios, medidos em centímetros, a partir do micélio central. Os valores aferidos foram aplicados à fórmula do Índice de Crescimento Micelial (ICM) para as análises estatísticas. Observou-se que o extrato metanólico apresentou uma tendência à redução de 32 % contra o B. sorokiniana, ao passo que o hexânico foi eficaz para ambos os fitopatógenos, apresentado uma tendência à redução de 49 % para o B. sorokiniana e 18 % para o C. gloeosporioides...|$|E
40|$|Com o objetivo de avaliar a eficiência de alguns fungicidas sobre Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, agente etiológico da antracnose do mamoeiro (Carica papaya L.), testes {{in vitro}} foram conduzidos no Laboratório de Epidemiologia/UFLA. Para tanto, utilizou-se o método de incorporação do fungicida ao meio de cultura BDA para avaliação da inibição do crescimento micelial e lâmina escavada contendo água com fungicida para germinação de conídios. Os fungicidas testados foram: azoxystrobin, chlorotalonil, hipoclorito de sódio, imazalil, oxicloreto de cobre, prochloraz, propiconazol, tebuconazol, {{thiabendazol}} e tiofanato metílico, nas concentrações de 0, 1, 10, 100, 500 e 1. 000 ppm para avaliar a inibição do crescimento do micélio e 0, 1, 10, 50 e 100 ppm para testar inibição da germinação de conídios. Os fungicidas azoxystrobin, chlorotalonil, imazalil, prochloraz, propiconazol e tebuconazol apresentaram alta eficiência na inibição do crescimento micelial. Os fungicidas dos grupos dos benzimidazóis (thiabendazol e tiofanato metílico) mostraram baixa eficiência e ineficiência, respectivamente, no controle do patógeno, demonstrando uma tolerância do isolado em estudo a estes produtos. O hipoclorito de sódio também apresentou baixa eficiência no controle do crescimento micelial do fungo. Quanto à inibição da germinação dos conídios, os fungicidas que demonstraram maior eficiência em baixas concentrações foram: chlorotalonil e hipoclorito de sódio. The efficiency of fungicides on Colletotrichum gloeosporioides was evaluated in vitro in the Laboratory of Epidemiology and Diseases Management of the <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Phytopathology</b> /UFLA. The fungicides were applied either in BDA medium or in glass slide chambers, {{the latter to}} assess the effects on conidial germination. The fungicides tested were: azoxystrobin, chlorothalonil, sodium hypochloride, imazalil, copper oxychloride, prochloraz, propiconazol, tebuconazol, thiabendazol and thiophanate-methyl in the concentrations of 0, 1, 10, 100, 500 and 1. 000 ppm to evaluate the inhibition of the mycelial growth and in the concentrations of 0, 1, 10, 50 and 100 ppm to test inhibition of the conidial germination. The fungicides azoxystrobin, chlorotalonil, imazalil, prochloraz, propiconazol and tebuconazol presented high efficiency in the inhibition of the mycelial growth. The fungicides of the benzimidazol group (thiabendazol and thiophanate-methyl) showed low efficiency in the control of C. gloeosporioides. Sodium hypochloride showed low efficiency in {{the control of the}} mycelial growth of the fungus. For inhibition of the conidial germination, the fungicides oxychloride, chlorothalonil and sodium hypochloride showed high efficiency, even at low concentrations. C. gloeosporioides showed to be tolerant to the fungicides thiabendazole and thiophanate-methyl, as conidial germination and mycelial growth were not affected in the presence of these products...|$|E
