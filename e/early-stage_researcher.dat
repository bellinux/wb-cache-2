40|$|This paper {{describes}} a highly client-oriented breeding applied {{to enhance the}} development and release of a tef (Eragrostis tef) variety with farmer participation in Ethiopia. The main features include; clear objective, target cross, <b>early-stage</b> <b>researcher</b> selection, multi-location yield trial, farmer on-station selection, judicious selection of few candidate varieties based on farmers' and researchers' selections, farmer managed on-farm trials, and release through the existing formal procedure. In the application of this strategy, tef exemplifies a crop with local importance, a clear market-driven selection criterion (cash crop) and farmers have better judgment of the criterion than researchers. Using farmers' consistent selection of genotypes, {{in conjunction with the}} required quantifiable data, breeders were able to release a new tef variety named "Quncho". The new variety was not the highest yielder, but it was higher in grain yield and better in seed-color quality (very white seed-color) than the long-time cultivated variety DZ- 01 - 196 (Magna), which was used as quality check. Given the appropriate degree of client-orientation, the results also show how farmer participation and formal breeding programs complement each other so as to overcome the rather prohibitive variety release procedures based on data from participatory breeding alone.

40|$|Ticks are blood-feeding {{arthropod}} ectoparasites of {{wild and}} domestic animals that transmit disease-causing pathogens to {{humans and animals}} worldwide and a good model for the characterization of tick-host-pathogen interactions. Tick-host-pathogen interactions consist of dynamic processes involving genetic traits of hosts, pathogens, and ticks that mediate their development and survival. Proteomics provides information on the protein content of cells and tissues that may differ from results at the transcriptomics level and may be relevant for basic biological studies and vaccine antigen discovery. In this chapter, we describe various methods for protein extraction and for proteomics analysis in ticks based on one-dimensional gel electrophoresis to characterize tick-host-pathogen interactions. Particularly relevant for this characterization {{is the use of}} blood-fed ticks. Therefore, we put special emphasis on working with replete ticks collected after feeding on vertebrate hosts.

40|$|Canine monocytic {{ehrlichiosis}} {{is caused}} by Ehrlichia canis, a small gram-negative coccoid bacterium that infects circulating monocytes. The disease is transmitted by the brown dog tick Rhipicephalus sanguineus s. l. and is acknowledged as an important infectious disease of dogs {{and other members of}} the family Canidae worldwide. E. canis is routinely cultured in vitro in the canine monocyte-macrophage cell line DH 82 and in non-vector Ixodes scapularis tick cell lines, but not in cells derived from its natural vector. Here we report infection and limited propagation of E. canis in the tick cell line RSE 8 derived from the vector R. sanguineus s. l., and successful propagation through six passages in a cell line derived from the experimental vector Dermacentor variabilis. In addition, using bacteria semi-purified from I. scapularis cells we attempted to infect a panel of cell lines derived from non-vector species of the tick genera Amblyomma, Dermacentor, Hyalomma, Ixodes and Rhipicephalus with E. canis and, for comparison, the closely-related Ehrlichia ruminantium, causative agent of heartwater in ruminants. Amblyomma and non-vector Dermacentor spp. cell lines appeared refractory to infection with E. canis but supported growth of E. ruminantium, while some, but not all, cell lines derived from Hyalomma, Ixodes and Rhipicephalus spp. ticks supported growth of both pathogens. We also illustrated and compared the ultrastructural morphology of E. canis in DH 82, RSE 8 and I. scapularis IDE 8 cells. This study confirms that E. canis, like E. ruminantium, is able to grow not only in cell lines derived from natural and experimental tick vectors but also in a wide range of other cell lines derived from tick species not known to transmit this pathogen.

40|$|Open Access {{funded by}} Wellcome Trust. [...] et al. Ticks {{transmit}} various {{human and animal}} microbial pathogens and may harbour more than one pathogen simultaneously. Both viruses and bacteria can trigger, and may subsequently suppress, vertebrate host and arthropod vector anti-microbial responses. Microbial coinfection of ticks could lead to an advantage or disadvantage for {{one or more of}} the microorganisms. In this preliminary study, cell lines derived from the ticks Ixodes scapularis and Ixodes ricinus were infected sequentially with 2 arthropod-borne pathogens, Borrelia burgdorferi s. s., Ehrlichia ruminantium, or Semliki Forest virus (SFV), and the effect of coinfection on the replication of these pathogens was measured. Prior infection of tick cell cultures with the spirochaete B. burgdorferi enhanced subsequent replication of the rickettsial pathogen E. ruminantium whereas addition of spirochaetes to cells infected with E. ruminantium had no effect on growth of the latter. Both prior and subsequent presence of B. burgdorferi also had a positive effect on SFV replication. Presence of E. ruminantium or SFV had no measurable effect on B. burgdorferi growth. In tick cells infected first with E. ruminantium and then with SFV, virus replication was significantly higher across all time points measured (24, 48, 72. h post infection), while presence of the virus had no detectable effect on bacterial growth. When cells were infected first with SFV and then with E. ruminantium, there was no effect on replication of either pathogen. The results of this preliminary study indicate that interplay does occur between different pathogens during infection of tick cells. Further study is needed to determine if this results from direct pathogen-pathogen interaction or from effects on host cell defences, and to determine if these observations also apply in vivo in ticks. If presence of one pathogen in the tick vector results in increased replication of another, this could have implications for disease transmission and incidence.

40|$|This paper explores how <b>early-stage</b> <b>researchers</b> {{in science}} move from {{learning}} about science to position themselves as practitioners of it. The paper draws on ethnographic field observations of two masters-level postgraduate students in laser optics and astrophysics {{made over the}} course of several months, as well as video recordings of one of these at work. The paper aims to show how early-stage research is managed and done by researchers (i. e., how these researchers can produce "professional" quality research despite still learning what it takes to do so). This study draws on two kinds of EM/CA studies: firstly, science education, both in school classrooms (e. g., Lynch and Macbeth, 1998; Macbeth, 2000) and at an undergraduate level (e. g., Benwell and Stokoe, 2002; Lindwall and Lymer, 2008); secondly, professional science (e. g., Garfinkel et al., 1981; Lynch, 1985). However, there are few, if any, ethnomethodological studies honing in on early-career researchers coming from a "learning" background and moving towards "doing" science for themselves. Whilst approaches other than ethnomethodology have covered this "space between" to some extent (e. g., Campbell, 2003; Delamont and Atkinson, 2001; Roth and Bowen, 2001), enculturationist studies such as these prefer to account for the cognitive and cultural problems that <b>early-stage</b> <b>researchers</b> face, entirely neglecting the work that characterises their endeavours as specifically scientific. By studying the work of research at this stage, it becomes apparent that researchers' introductions to these surroundings are not experienced as a "reality-shock" (Delamont and Atkinson, 2001 : 88) where all vestiges to instructional learning are suddenly removed, leaving students to either successfully adapt to the unfamiliar world of independent (although guided) research or fail. Rather, this transition (if it is even a "transition" at all and not an "extension") happens over a much more drawn-out period (with no definitive start- or end-point) which ensures that researchers don't experience this as any sort of shock at all. This is partially because being an undergraduate learner does not necessarily preclude you from accurately imagining and understanding the work of scientific research, and partially because the process of doing the work itself guides researchers' activities. Consequently, looking at this material ethnomethodologically allows us to produce a different account of this sort of research, one which doesn't necessarily rely on sharp conceptual distinctions between a "learning stage" and a "research stage" only traversable through cultural adaptation...|$|R

Based on a decade of teaching <b>early-stage</b> <b>researchers</b> {{in the social sciences}} at the LSE and other universities, and written with the central problems of beginning researchers in mind, Bob Hancké guides them through the process of thinking about the links between theory, cases and data, and to do so in a way that helps to turn their initial plausible ideas into convincing arguments. This lively book, deliberately jargon-free and with a hands-on, pragmatic approach to research design, addresses the problems that research students face - or ignore, often at their peril - {{in the course of their}} first few years. Its central message is that research is a complex and iterative process in which researchers construct every relevant part of their project with one goal in mind: make a persuasive point. They define the question they ask and the debate they engage, construct their cases and data to answer that question, and write it up as an argument that brings out the strengths of their research design. It addresses such key issues as statistical versus configurational approaches, time in social science research, different types of case studies and comparative research, and a critical approach to data.

Based on impressions from the Valuation as Practice workshop at The University of Edinburgh in early 2014 we were inspired by the example of Kjellberg et al. (2013) to debate how we see, understand, and are inspired by the field of valuation studies. It is the hope of the editors that sharing the concerns of <b>early-stage</b> <b>researchers</b> starting out in a field in flux, may be of use to, and perhaps spur, senior contributors to further develop this emerging research landscape. Using the workshop experience as a springboard, we argue that the domain of valuation studies still relies heavily on influences from the study of economics, with a strong emphasis on processes of quantification and calculation. With apparent pragmatism within the field, concern as to what might be lost by this narrower perspective is raised. Additionally, we call for the exploration of the possibility of a common language of valuation, to better define shared features, and identify as well as manage conflicts within the field. !

40|$|When first {{designing}} {{a research project}} and particularly when drawing the linkages between the theoretical, philosophical and empirical approaches on which the research will be grounded (Ward 2014), methodological questions often constitute the most compelling challenges for <b>early-stage</b> <b>researchers</b> and Ph. D. candidates. Qualitative methods and specially ethnographic investigations are gaining momentum and indeed recent situated inquiries in geography studies have distanced themselves from straightforward ethnographic narratives based on prefixed social categories. Instead, they adopt processual and in-becoming conceptualizations of the everyday agencies occurring in urban spaces, possibly to contest given social classifications. Nonetheless, the long-standing debates on the effectiveness and scientific legitimacy of ethnographic approaches are still animate. Concerns of power, ethics and positionality are particularly vivid for a researcher; issues of consistency, accuracy and accountability of narrative-making methods along with questions about the scientific rigor of the production {{of this type of}} knowledge often emerge and need to be confronted and worked out. Furthermore, there is usually a latent eagerness for producing transformative actions and generative alternatives that go beyond a purely descriptive sphere and instead demands to engage politically with the situated accounts that the researched contexts could open. This contribution aims to further explore the mentioned dilemmas. The objective is to address these basilar research and ethical questions in the light of approaches that could unravel them, such as the concepts of phronetic approach to social science (Flyvbjerg 2001, 2004) and of positive generative critique (Latour 2004, McFarlane 2011 b) ...|$|R
40|$|Social {{cost-benefit}} analysis (CBA) of projects {{has been successfully}} applied in {{different fields such as}} transport, energy, health, education, and environment, including climate change. It is often argued {{that it is impossible to}} extend the CBA approach to the evaluation of the social impact of research infrastructures, because the final benefit to society of scientific discovery is generally unpredictable. Here, we propose a quantitative approach to this problem, we use it to design an empirically testable CBA model, and we apply it to the the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the highest-energy accelerator in the world, currently operating at CERN. We show that the evaluation of benefits can be made quantitative by determining their value to users (scientists, <b>early-stage</b> <b>researchers,</b> firms, visitors) and non-users (the general public). Four classes of contributions to users are identified: knowledge output, human capital development, technological spillovers, and cultural effects. Benefits for non-users can be estimated, in analogy to public goods with no practical use (such as environment preservation), using willingness to pay. We determine the probability distribution of cost and benefits for the LHC since 1993 until planned decommissioning in 2025, and we find there is a 92 % probability that benefits exceed its costs, with an expected net present value of about 3 billion euro, not including the unpredictable economic value of discovery of any new physics. We argue that the evaluation approach proposed here can be replicated for any large-scale research infrastructure, thus helping the decision-making on competing projects, with a socio-economic appraisal complementary to other evaluation criteria.

This is even more important for rare and fatal diseases like pancreas cancer (PC). Methods: The COST Action BM 1204 is a unique platform to facilitate the collaboration of a broad range of European and international PC multidisciplinary research groups in order to: (1) integrate knowledge and experience in a multidisciplinary way 'from cell to society', (2) promote the application of uniform study tools and protocols, (3) foster their optimal use by <b>early-stage</b> <b>researchers,</b> (4) enhance the mobility and training of researchers, and (5) disseminate the results produced to the broader society. Results: This Action will develop novel interdisciplinary tools for collaborative research to improve our understanding of PC and its prevention, diagnosis and treatment. It also aims to answer questions related to the etiology, early detection, evidence-based and personalized treatment, and health management for PC. Furthermore, the Action will contribute to new insights into PC personalized medicine and beyond {{as well as to the}} understanding of complex and rare diseases taking PC as a best practice example.

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the utility of the}} ischium-pubic index (IPI), a sexing technique that compares the lengths of pubis and ischium. The ratio was adapted by Washburn from a primate index devised by Schultz and was tested by Washburn on documented remains from the Hamann-Todd Human Osteological Collection. The IPI is used by forensic investigators, and indeed, the method is found in standard forensic textbooks and thus appears to be valid to <b>early-stage</b> <b>researchers.</b> However, its reliability has been questioned by physical anthropologists almost from its inception due to the intrinsic subjectivity of locating the base point from which both lengths are taken. In addition, at least one variation of the original technique is found in the literature, which alters the base point profoundly. To explore both the original method and the ramifications of altering the base point, in this article the IPI is calculated from os coxae recovered from the Mary Rose, a 16 th-century English warship lost in a documented disaster; the sample is assumed to be from males. Using the original index, 20. 4 % of individuals (11 of 54) or, viewing the remains as commingled, 15. 5 % of individual pelves (15 of 97) were misclassified. Results with the base point shifted were disastrous: 95. 5 % (21 of 22) individuals and 91. 4 % (32 of 35) pelves were misclassified. Accuracy may be influenced by the technician’s expertise; however, when the original methodology is altered, the results become meaningless. This article aims to promote more careful reading of our sources and to suggest that the IPI is not appropriate as a tool for sexing forensic remains...|$|R
30|$|Defazio et al. (2009) {{examined}} {{the relationships between}} the collaborative incentives and researcher productivity in the context of EU-funded research networks. The authors found that in spite of the generally observed positive relationship between the impact of funding and researcher productivity, the overall impact of collaborative activities within the funded networks is less significant (2009). However, when Defazio et al. (2009) distinguished between the pre-, during- and post-funding periods, they identified some important differences. Collaboration during the funding period did not result in an increase of research productivity; however, in the post-funding stage, the impact of collaboration on the productivity was both positive and significant. An important conclusion from the study is that while collaborations (formed specifically for exploiting funding opportunities) were not effective at improving researcher productivity in the short term, they still contributed to promoting effective collaborations in the longer term. Their findings are limited because of the difference between the type of research collaborations reviewed by Defazio et al. (2009) and formal networking research projects such as COST Actions. In the research projects reviewed by Defazio et al. (2009), funding support covers the costs of the project (the cost of managing the project, the cost of equipment and all project-related personnel costs, including their travel and subsistence. Other research networks were in receipt of a grant up to 100 % of the cost for hiring <b>early-stage</b> <b>researchers,</b> for organizing conferences and meetings that involve the other partners of the network (Defazio et al. 2009). The researchers within the research networks reviewed by the authors were availing of general research funding, while researchers participating in collaborative Actions funded by COST do not receive any actual funding for conducting research; they only receive funds for facilitating research networking (meetings, exchanges, training schools, etc.).|$|R
40|$|The European Facility for Airborne Research, EUFAR, is an Integrating Activity of the 7 th Framework Programme (FP 7) of the European Commission {{with funding}} {{covering}} the period 2014 - 2018. The current EUFAR follows three previous contracts under FP 5, FP 6 and FP 7, and currently represents {{a consortium of}} 24 European institutions and organisations involved in airborne research. 18 small and medium size aircraft equipped with a multitude of different sensor systems are available to the European scientific community through transnational access. The following hyperspectral cameras are available through EUFAR to researchers, {{who do not have}} access to a corresponding research infrastructure in their home country: - AHS - aisaFenix - aisaOwl - APEX - CASI - HySpex VNIR - HySpex SWIR - TASI Transnational access is not the only aspect of EUFAR, which is of high interest for the hyperspectral research community. EUFAR also offers Education and Training opportunities for the next-generation <b>researchers.</b> <b>Early-stage</b> <b>researchers</b> have the chance to take part in EUFAR training courses including a flight campaign and to join already planned flight campaigns. EUFAR also offers the platform to exchange knowledge and promote best practice in airborne research through Expert Working Groups, of which several relate to issues of hyperspectral remote sensing (e. g. hyperspectral data processing, hyperspectral applications for soil, calibration and validation). One research activity within EUFAR deals with the development of methodologies and tools for the integrated use of airborne hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data and airborne laser scanning (ALS) data in order to produce improved HSI and ALS products. This poster will give an overview of all activities taking place within the EUFAR project showing the possibilities for researchers to get involved in Europe’s biggest network of airborne Earth Observation...|$|R
40|$|Writing {{constitutes}} a significant challenge for junior addiction researchers. Writing support programmes appear to improve writing skills and enhance productivity. However, addiction researchers have not benefited from writing support groups {{to the same}} extent as other professions, mainly {{due to the lack of}} support for and considerable variation among these programmes. Given a lack of research about the contribution of writing support programmes to publication productivity among <b>early-stage</b> addiction <b>researchers,</b> this article offers critical insights into the process and outcomes of such programmes, based on the substantial experience accumulated from taking part in several writing support programmes, including the scheme of the International Society of Addiction Journal Editors (ISAJE). A better understanding of what makes writing groups effective may help build evidence for writing programs and universities to equip addiction investigators with the skills they need to improve the health of people with substance use disorders via better writing...|$|R
