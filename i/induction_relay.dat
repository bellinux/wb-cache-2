40|$|In this paper, {{multihop}} relaying in RF-based {{communications and}} near field magnetic induction communication (NFMIC) is discussed. Three multihop relay strategies for NFMIC are proposed: Non Line of Sight Magnetic <b>Induction</b> <b>Relay</b> (NLoS-MI Relay), Non Line of Sight Master/Assistant Magnetic <b>Induction</b> <b>Relay</b> 1 (NLoS-MAMI Relay 1) and Non Line of Sight Master/Assistant Magnetic <b>Induction</b> <b>Relay</b> 2 (NLoSMAMI Relay 2). In the first approach only one node {{contributes to the}} communication, while {{in the other two}} techniques (which are based on a master-assistant strategy), two relaying nodes are employed. This paper shows that these three techniques can be used to overcome the problem of dead spots within a body area network and extend the communication range without increasing the transmission power and the antenna size or decreasing receiver sensitivity. The impact of the separation distance between the nodes on the achievable RSS and channel data rate is evaluated for the three techniques. It is demonstrated that the technique which is most effective depends on the specific network topology. Optimum selection of nodes as relay master and assistant based on the location of the nodes is discussed. The paper also studies the impact of the quality factor on achievable data rate. It is shown that to obtain the highest data rate, the optimum quality factor needs to be determined for each proposed cooperative communication method...|$|E

A protective relay may respond to the magnitude of a quantity such as voltage or current. <b>Induction</b> <b>relays</b> can respond to the product of two quantities in two field coils, which could for example represent the power in a circuit.|$|R

"Induction" [...] disk meters work by {{inducing}} {{currents in}} a disk that {{is free to}} rotate; the rotary motion of the disk operates a contact. <b>Induction</b> <b>relays</b> require alternating current; if two or more coils are used, they must be at the same frequency otherwise no net operating force is produced. These electromagnetic <b>relays</b> use the <b>induction</b> principle discovered by Galileo Ferraris in the late 19th century. The magnetic system in <b>induction</b> disc overcurrent <b>relays</b> is designed to detect overcurrents in a power system and operate with a pre-determined time delay when certain overcurrent limits have been reached. In order to operate, the magnetic system in the relays produces torque that acts on a metal disc to make contact, according to the following basic current/torque equation: ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} the protection arrangements for {{small and large}} 3 -phase induction motors either of squirrel cage or wound rotor type. The design and operation algorithm {{for the protection of}} Induction Motor is done using MSP 430 F 148 microcontroller. Various fault conditions for the protection of <b>Induction</b> Motor <b>relay</b> are realized by calculating the values of V and I during the fault condition. The signals are taken from the supply line converted to digital signals which then are fed to microcontroller having a program written in it to estimate the values of V and I. The calculated values of V and I are compared with set values to decide about the action to be taken. Design and development of microcontroller based <b>induction</b> motor protection <b>relay</b> is recent trend in field practice. One such design effort has been made by authors.

50|$|Static relays {{have been}} {{designed}} to perform similar functions with the use of electronic circuit control as an electromechanical relay performs with the use of moving parts or elements. For example, in an <b>induction</b> type electromechanical <b>relay,</b> the time delay for the switching action can be adjusted by adjusting the distance traveled by the disc, whereas in a static relay the delay can be set by adjusting the value of the resistance in an R-C time delay circuit.|$|R
40|$|Induction motor {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} motors used in industrial applications. The operating condition may sometime lead the machine into different fault situations. The main types of external faults experienced by these motors are over loading, single phasing, unbalanced supply voltage, locked rotor, phase reversal, ground fault, under voltage and over voltage. The machine should be shut down when a fault is experienced to avoid damage and for the safety of the workers. Computer based relays monitor the machine and disconnect it during the faults. The relay logic used to identify these faults requires sophisticated signal processing techniques for fast and reliable operation. Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been applied in <b>induction</b> motor <b>relays.</b> Though the ANN based methods are reliable, the selection of the ANN structures and training is time consuming. Recently it is observed that the A...|$|R
40|$|The {{electromechanical}} {{overcurrent protection}} relays {{are designed to}} operate with sinusoidal current. The operation of protective relay with harmonic currents is not reliable. The literature on harmonics and relays covers mostly the theoretical studies. In this paper, the harmonic effects on operation of electromechanical inverse time overcurrent relay (ITOCR) were examined. Not common in existing studies, the behaviour of ITOCR was analysed with laboratory experiments for distorted waveforms. A type of <b>induction</b> disc <b>relay</b> {{was used as an}} electromechanical ITOCR in the experiments. The non-sinusoidal load currents that consist of different harmonic spectra were applied to ITOCR and these nonlinear-load currents were processed by a data acquisition card and a harmonic analysis programme in the computer environment. According to the experiment results, the pick up current and the operating time of the ITOCR increase proportionally to the total harmonic distortion (THD) value of the non-sinusoidal current. It is concluded that, this type of relay cannot protect the system reliably due to the harmonic components of current...|$|R
