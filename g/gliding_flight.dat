5|$|Scales {{may have}} evolved {{initially}} for providing insulation. Scales on the thorax {{and other parts}} of the body may contribute to maintaining the high body temperatures required during flight. The 'solid' scales of basal moths are however not as efficient as those of their more advanced relatives as the presence of a lumen adds air layers and increases the insulation value. Scales also help increase the lift to drag ratio in <b>gliding</b> <b>flight.</b>|$|E
5|$|This {{efficient}} long-distance travelling {{underlies the}} albatross's {{success as a}} long-distance forager, covering great distances and expending little energy looking for patchily distributed food sources. Their adaptation to <b>gliding</b> <b>flight</b> makes them dependent on wind and waves, however, as their long wings are ill-suited to powered flight and most species lack the muscles and energy to undertake sustained flapping flight. Albatrosses in calm seas are forced {{to rest on the}} ocean's surface until the wind picks up again. The North Pacific albatrosses can use a flight style known as flap-gliding, where the bird progresses by bursts of flapping followed by gliding. When taking off, albatrosses need to take a run up to allow enough air to move under the wing to provide lift.|$|E
50|$|George Cayley studied flight scientifically in {{the first}} half of the 19th century, and in the second half of the 19th century Otto Lilienthal made over 200 <b>gliding</b> <b>flights</b> and was also one of the first to {{understand}} flight scientifically. His work was replicated and extended by the Wright brothers who made <b>gliding</b> <b>flights</b> and finally the first controlled and extended, manned powered flights.|$|R
50|$|Between 1867 and 1896 the German {{pioneer of}} human {{aviation}} Otto Lilienthal developed heavier-than-air flight. He {{was the first}} person to make well-documented, repeated, successful <b>gliding</b> <b>flights.</b>|$|R
50|$|Otto Lilienthal {{monument}} - The memorial plaque {{which is}} located in Schütte-Lanz-Straße 25, Berlin-Lichterfelde, was built in memory of Otto Lilienthal - a German pioneer of human aviation who {{became known as the}} Glider King.

5|$|Pelicans {{are very}} large birds with very long bills characterised by a downcurved hook {{at the end}} of the upper mandible, and the {{attachment}} of a huge gular pouch to the lower. The slender rami of the lower bill and the flexible tongue muscles form the pouch into a basket for catching fish and, sometimes, rainwater, though in order not to hinder the swallowing of large fish, the tongue itself is tiny. They have a long neck and short stout legs with large, fully webbed feet. Although they are among the heaviest of flying birds, they are relatively light for their apparent bulk because of air pockets in the skeleton and beneath the skin enabling them to float high in the water. The tail is short and square. The wings are long and broad, suitably shaped for soaring and <b>gliding</b> <b>flight,</b> and have the unusually large number of 30 to 35 secondary flight feathers.|$|E
5|$|Mammals are {{a diverse}} class of animals, mostly {{terrestrial}} {{but some are}} aquatic and others have evolved flapping or <b>gliding</b> <b>flight.</b> They mostly have four limbs but some aquatic mammals have no limbs or limbs modified into fins and the forelimbs of bats are modified into wings. The legs of most mammals are situated below the trunk, which is held well clear of the ground. The bones of mammals are well ossified and their teeth, which are usually differentiated, are coated in a layer of prismatic enamel. The teeth are shed once (milk teeth) during the animal's lifetime or not at all, {{as is the case}} in cetaceans. Mammals have three bones in the middle ear and a cochlea in the inner ear. They are clothed in hair and their skin contains glands which secrete sweat. Some of these glands are specialized as mammary glands, producing milk to feed the young. Mammals breathe with lungs and have a muscular diaphragm separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs. The mammalian heart has four chambers and oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept entirely separate. Nitrogenous waste is excreted primarily as urea.|$|E
25|$|Eilmer of Malmesbury (also {{known as}} Oliver {{due to a}} scribe's miscopying, or Elmer) was an 11th-century English Benedictine monk {{best known for his}} early attempt at a <b>gliding</b> <b>flight</b> using wings.|$|E
50|$|The Bisnovat 5 {{was ordered}} into {{development}} {{to provide an}} all-Soviet alternative to an aircraft built with foreign technology. Originally intended to take-off from the ground, <b>gliding</b> <b>flights</b> were carried out from a Petlyakov Pe-8 mothership, {{similar to the way}} that the Bell X-1 was dropped from a B-29 Superfortress mothership.|$|R
50|$|Otto Lilienthal {{published}} his book Der Vogelflug als Grundlage der Fliegekunst (Birdflight as the Basis of Aviation) in 1889, describing {{the basis of}} modern aerodynamics and aircraft construction. Lilienthal made many successful <b>gliding</b> <b>flights</b> from 1891 onwards. But {{the focus of attention}} shifted to powered flight after the Wright Brothers had demonstrated their Wright Flyer.|$|R
50|$|While {{not capable}} of powered flight they often obtain lift {{in the course of}} their <b>gliding</b> <b>flights.</b> Glides as long as 60 m have been recorded, over which the animal loses only 10 m in height, which is quite some distance, {{considering}} that one of these lizards is only around 20 cm in total length (tail included).|$|R
25|$|Chrysopelea ornata is a {{colubrid}} snake {{found in}} both South and Southeast Asia. It is, {{along with the}} other species in its genus Chrysopelea, very unusual in that it is capable of a type of <b>gliding</b> <b>flight.</b> It is also rear-fanged. Currently, three subspecies are recognized. The snake's striking looks and capability of gliding make it a popular choice for captivity.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} animals have evolved aerial locomotion, either by powered flight or by gliding. Flying and gliding animals (volant animals) have evolved {{separately}} many times, without any single ancestor. Flight has evolved at least four times, in the insects, pterosaurs, birds, and bats. Gliding has evolved on many more occasions. Usually the development is to aid canopy animals in getting from tree to tree, although there are other possibilities. Gliding, in particular, has evolved among rainforest animals, especially in the rainforests in Asia (most especially Borneo) where the trees are tall and widely spaced. Several species of aquatic animals, and a few amphibians have also evolved to acquire this <b>gliding</b> <b>flight</b> ability, typically {{as a means of}} evading predators.|$|E
25|$|Sankar Chatterjee {{suggested}} in 2005 that, {{in order for}} Microraptor to glide or fly, the forewings and hindwings must have been on different levels (as on a biplane) and not overlaid (as on a dragonfly), and that the latter posture would have been anatomically impossible. Using this biplane model, Chatterjee was able to calculate possible methods of gliding, and determined that Microraptor most likely employed a phugoid style of gliding: launching itself from a perch, the animal would have swooped downward in a deep U-shaped curve and then lifted again to land on another tree. The feathers not directly employed in the biplane wing structure, like those on the tibia and the tail, {{could have been used}} to control drag and alter the flight path, trajectory, etc. The orientation of the hindwings would also have helped the animal control its <b>gliding</b> <b>flight.</b> Chatterjee also used computer algorithms that test animal flight capacity to test whether or not Microraptor was capable of true, powered flight, as opposed to or in addition to passive gliding. The resulting data showed that Microraptor did have the requirements to sustain level powered flight, so it is theoretically possible that the animal flew as opposed to gliding.|$|E
5000|$|Faster {{and more}} {{reliable}} transition from <b>gliding</b> to powered <b>flight,</b> {{as the time}} and risk required to start and warm up a gas-powered engine is eliminated. For example, the Antares 20E transitions from <b>gliding</b> to powered <b>flight</b> in under 12 seconds.|$|R
5000|$|Brillant was {{a flight}} amateur {{and joined the}} gliding club of Jaroslaw {{at the age of}} 13. There he studied {{building}} gliders, aircraft, <b>gliding</b> and <b>flight.</b>|$|R
50|$|Montgomery's {{own account}} {{made clear that}} he {{considered}} the technology of {{the second and third}} gliders of 1885 and 1886 as effective, but the airfoil designs were a disappointment in terms of lift-generation as they produced much shorter <b>gliding</b> <b>flights</b> in comparison to the first craft of 1884. He realized he was getting increasingly farther from understanding the mechanism of lift and began controlled laboratory experiments to investigate airfoils. In 1886, he briefly considered filing a patent caveat for lateral balancing, but did not.|$|R
500|$|The wings, head {{parts of}} thorax, and abdomen of Lepidoptera {{are covered with}} minute scales, from which feature the order Lepidoptera derives its names, the word lepidos in Ancient Greek meaning [...] "scale". Most scales are {{lamellar}} (blade-like) and attached with a pedicel, while other forms may be hair-like or specialised as secondary sexual characteristics. The lumen, or surface of the lamella, has a complex structure. It gives colour either due to the pigments contained within it or through its three-dimensional structure. Scales provide a number of functions, which include insulation, thermoregulation and aiding <b>gliding</b> <b>flight,</b> amongst others, {{the most important of}} which is the large diversity of vivid or indistinct patterns they provide which help the organism protect itself by camouflage, mimicry, and to seek mates.|$|E
500|$|Wing types defined herewith: elliptical; high speed; high aspect ratio; soaring. The bird's forelimbs {{that are}} the key to flight. Each wing has a central axis, {{composed}} of three limb bones, the humerus, ulna and radius. The hand, or manus, which ancestrally was composed of five digits, is reduced to three digits (digit II, III and IV or I, II, III depending on the scheme followed), which serves as an anchor for the , one of two groups of flight feathers responsible for the wing's airfoil shape. The other set of flight feathers, behind the carpal joint on the ulna, are called the [...] The remaining feathers on the wing are known as , of which there are three sets. The wing sometimes has vestigial claws. In most species these are lost by the time the bird is adult (such as the highly visible ones used for active climbing by hoatzin chicks), but claws are retained into adulthood by the secretarybird, screamers, finfoots, ostriches, several swifts and numerous others, as a local trait, in a few specimens. Most kinds of bird wings can be grouped into four types, with some falling between two of these types: i) elliptical wings—short and rounded, having a low aspect ratio, allowing for tight maneuvering in confined spaces such as might be found in dense vegetation, which are common in forest raptors and many migratory species of passerines, and species that use a rapid take off to evade predators, such as pheasants and partridges; ii) high speed wings—short, pointed wings that when combined with a heavy wing loading and rapid wingbeats provide an energetically expensive high speed, used by the bird with the fastest wing speed, the peregrine falcon, as well as by most of the ducks and the auks who uses the shape for a different purpose, to [...] "fly" [...] underwater; iii) high aspect ratio wings—typified by low wing loading and which are far longer than they are wide, they are used for slower flight which may take the form of almost hovering (as used by kestrels, terns and nightjars) or in soaring and <b>gliding</b> <b>flight,</b> particularly the dynamic soaring used by seabirds, which takes advantage of wind speed variation at different altitudes (wind shear) above ocean waves to provide lift; and iv) soaring wings with deep slots—common in larger species of inland birds, such as eagles, vultures, pelicans, and storks, the slots {{at the end of the}} wings, between the primaries, reduce the induced drag and wingtip vortices, whilst the shorter size of the wings aids in takeoff (high aspect ratio wings require a long taxi to get airborne).|$|E
2500|$|Halfbeaks (gliding). A group {{related to}} the Exocoetidae, one or two hemirhamphid species possess {{enlarged}} pectoral fins and show true <b>gliding</b> <b>flight</b> rather than simple leaps. Marshall (1965) reports that Euleptorhamphus viridis can cover [...] in two separate hops.|$|E

50|$|Palmer {{experimented with}} about 8 {{different}} hang glider versions and their wings were mostly 90 degree swept back wings.

His first and largest hang glider was about 45 pounds and had a surface area of 342 sq ft. Palmer explored control of his several versions of hang gliders by using different control frames: pilot {{in front of the}} control frame, pilot behind the control frame, and control frame in front of the pilot in a swing seat, which inadvertently approximated the George A.

2500|$|The two {{different}} wings {{known to have}} been fitted to the Parasol both had constant chord and very square tips. [...] They were of fabric covered wood construction.

[...] The supercharged 226hp (167kW) Armstrong Siddeley Lynx radial engine was smoothly cowled but with its cylinder heads exposed. [...] The observer sat in the front cockpit, allowing him direct access to the dynamometer. [...] This had a control wheel and dial for the force readings, plus a lever with which he could free, read or lock the instrument. [...] The pilot's cockpit, behind and with a view unobstructed by the wing had two unusual controls associated with the measurements. [...] He could engage a pair of dynamometer cams which limited its movement and that of the wings to the 6mm necessary for a force measurement in case of a dynamometer failure. [...] He also controlled an hydraulic brake which was used to stop the engine during measurements and avoid prop wash interference.

[...] Amphibious fish, are fish {{that are able to}} leave water for extended periods of time. [...] These fish use a range of terrestrial locomotory modes, such as lateral undulation, tripod-like walking (using paired fins and tail), and jumping. Many of these locomotory modes incorporate multiple combinations of pectoral, pelvic and tail fin movement. Examples include eels, mudskippers and the walking catfish. [...] Flying fish can make powerful, self-propelled leaps out of water into air, where their long, wing-like fins enable <b>gliding</b> <b>flight</b> for considerable distances above the water's surface.
