Results are compared with previous elastic-plastic models for perfect slip and full stick contact conditions. It is found that materials with modulus of elasticity to yield strength (E/Y) ratio less than and greater than 300 show strikingly different contact behavior. When E/Y ratio is less than 300, contact load increases {{with the increase in}} modulus of elasticity whereas in <b>elastic-plastic</b> <b>range,</b> contact load decreases with the increase in yield strength...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to develop a fiber-optic acoustic emission(AE) sensor applicable to on-line monitoring systems which is suitable for long-distance signal transmission. An AE sensor was developed by use of a fiber-optic cantilever and an extrinsic Fabry-Perot interferometer(EFPI). The efficiency of signal processing was improved by driving the high frequency AE signals into the low frequency ones. In order to verify the developed sensor, the tensile and the pencil lead fracture(PLF) tests were performed including the experiment showing the Kaiser effect. From tests, AE signals were successfully detected in the <b>elastic-plastic</b> deformation <b>range,</b> especially higher signals at the crack propagation. The developed sensor is expected to be used for an on-line monitoring of crack propagation in mechanical systems...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the stress distribution in the open, cone-shaped, sandwich shell panel. The shell under consideration consists of two load-carrying facings and a core layer of the soft type. The facings are made of an isotropic, compressible, work-hardening material and they are geometrically and physically symmetrical, so they are of equal thicknesses and the same material properties. The core layer resists transverse shear only. The shell under consideration is under combined external load in the form of lateral pressure and a longitudinal force. Different ratios of the longitudinal force to the lateral pressure are taken into account. In each case, the components of the effective stress as well as the effective stress values corresponding to the shell deformation were determined. To determine the stress state which occurs during the shell deformation, the stability equations have to be derived. The effective stress corresponding to the deformations in the shell under consideration can occur within the elastic, <b>elastic-plastic</b> or plastic <b>range.</b> In order to determine the stress distribution in the shell under consideration which corresponds to the on- and post-critical state, the constitutive relations of the Nadai-Hencky deformation theory, alongside the Huber-Mises-Hencky yield condition, are accepted. Analyses show that, in certain cases, there are very large differences between the values of the components of the stress state. In such cases, it seems to be possible to omit the components with small values...|$|R
40|$|This eBook is {{the second}} {{in a series of}} books on the {{critical}} earthquake response of elastic-plastic structures or rigid blocks under near-fault ground motions, and includes four original research papers which were published in the specialty section Earthquake Engineering in ‘Frontiers in Built Environment’. Several extensions of the first book 1 are included here. The first article is on the soil-structure interaction problem. The reduction of an original soil-structure interaction model into a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) model enables the application of the original theory for an SDOF model to such complicated soil-structure interaction model. The second article is concerned with the extension of the original theory for an SDOF model to a 2 DOF model. Since the simple application of the original theory for an SDOF model to a multi-degree-of-freedom model is difficult due to out-of-phase phenomenon of multiple masses, a convex model theory is introduced and an upper bound of elastic-plastic response is derived. The third article is related to the stability problem of structures (collapse problems of structures) in which the P-delta effect is included. It is shown that the original theory for an SDOF model with elastic-perfectly plastic restoring-force characteristic can be applied to a model with negative second slope. The fourth article is an application of the energy balance approach to an overturning limit problem of rigid blocks. A closed-form expression of the overturning limit of rigid blocks is derived for the first time after the Housner’s pioneering work in 1963. The approach presented in this book, together with the first book, is an epoch-making accomplishment to open the door for simpler and deeper understanding of structural reliability of built environments in the <b>elastic-plastic</b> and nonlinear <b>range...</b>|$|R

Based on the simplest deformation theory of plasticity, the overall transverse polyaxial elastoplastic constitutive equations for an incompressible composite are obtained. A simple formula is suggested to evaluate the average stress in the fibres. Furthermore, with the prediction of the overall transverse elastic moduli of a compressible composite, the overall transverse uniaxial stress-strain curve for a compressible composite in the entire <b>elastic-plastic</b> <b>range</b> is obtained. A detailed example is given for a Boron-Aluminum composite. Comparison is made with the experimental and theoretical work done by General Dynamics and Adams respectively...|$|E

The duration of dynamic loading {{was assumed to be}} equal to a period of the natural fundamental flexural vibrations of a structure under analysis. Numerical calculations were performed with the finite element method using ANSYS® 11. 0 software. The results of computations were presented as maximum angle of the rotation of the girder in a function of the dynamic load factor, DLF (the ratio of pulse loading amplitude to static critical load).

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{derivation}} of the basic stability equations of bi-layered elastic-plastic conical shells and a approximate solution to these equations, both theoretically and by numerical procedures. The subject of the analysis is a bilayered open conical shell under a combined load comprising longitudinal forces and external pressure. Kirchhoff-Love’s hypotheses hold for the layers, and use is made of constitutive relations {{in the form of}} generalized Hooke’s law for the elastic stability analy-sis, and the Prandtl-Reuss incremental plasticity theory for the stability analysis in the <b>elastic-plastic</b> <b>range.</b> The stability equations are derived using the virtual work principle, and Ritz’s method is applied to so-lve the equations.

40|$|Abstract. The dynamic {{analysis}} of earthquake responses of one simple bridge structure supported by hinged and rolled bearing and another simple bridge structure isolated by lead-core rubber bearings {{was described in}} <b>elastic-plastic</b> <b>range.</b> The relative displacements and accelerations of the structures were calculated under different amplitude earthquake waves in order to observe the influence of lead-core rubber bearing on earthquake- resistance of bridges. The availability of the analysis model, hysteretic model and relevant parameters adopted {{as well as the}} computation program developed are verified. According to the analysis of dynamic response data, the lead-core rubber bearings with proper parameters are used to improve the dynamic performance of the structures, the seismic response of the bridge deck and pier would therefore be greatly reduced, the safety and seismic performance of the structure are globally raised, earthquake- resistance could be increased, and rather good economic benefits have been achieved as well. The analysis can provide accurately the reference basis for construction design...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. It is {{important}} to calculate straightening stroke precisely for automatic straightening machines. But, the existing mathematic models for calculating straightening stroke can not solve this problem well. In this paper, the mathematic load-deflection model, which reflects elastic range, <b>elastic-plastic</b> <b>range</b> and elastic spring back of press straightening process, is developed. By using the model, the straightening stroke can be calculated directly according to the initial deflection of the bent part. By simplicity, the rectangular section part is selected for study and {{is assumed to be}} the ideal elastic-plastic material. Based on the elastic-plastic mechanics theory, through deriving relationships among the load, bending moment, deflection and elastic region length, the theoretical model of press straightening process has been established. Finally, two examples are calculated. The results calculated by the model are in good agreement with the results computed by FEM. Experimental data also show that the calculation results by the model is exact and the error is small. So the validity and the accuracy of the model are verified. It will be helpful to the development of automatic straightening machines...|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{analysis}} of notch-root stresses and strains in bodies subjected to multiaxial loading, a quantitative relationship between Neuber rule and the equivalent strain energy density method is found. In the case of elastic range, both Neuber rule and the equivalent strain energy density method get the same estimation of the local stresses and strains. Whereas {{in the case of}} <b>elastic-plastic</b> <b>range,</b> Neuber rule generally overestimates the notch-root stresses and strains and the equivalent strain energy density method tends to underestimate the notch-root stresses and strains. A modified method is presented considering the material constants of elastic-plastic Poisson's ratio, elastic modulus, shear elastic modulus, and yield stress. The essence of the modified model is to add a modified coefficient to Neuber rule, which makes the calculated results tend to be more precise and reveals its energy meaning. This approach considers the elastic-plastic properties of the material itself and avoids the blindness of selecting coefficient values. Finally the calculation results using the modified model are validated with the experimental data...|$|E

Coupled mathematical and numerical models of thermal phenomena, mechanical and phase transitions in solid and liquid state are proposed. To the modeling of phase transformation in the solid state the macroscopic model based on {{the analysis of the}} CTP diagrams are used. In the simulation of thermal phenomena the solution of heat transport equations with melting and solidification model is applied. Mechanical phenomena using the stress model for a <b>elastic-plastic</b> <b>range</b> and the isotropic strengthening of material are simulated.

40|$|Various {{extrusion}} cross-sections {{designs are}} used to build advanced aerospace planes. Material for these designs vary, most use aluminum, titanium, steels and composites. Most metallics are formed in the <b>elastic-plastic</b> <b>range</b> of the material. Considerable spring-back occurs coupled with buckling and necking during forming operations. The analysis of a I-beam join section is modeled. The standard forming practice for extru sions currently utilize two forming steps: Pre-forming in the “O ” condition, heat-treated to the “W ” condition where the final forming operation is performed. Each part then requires costly hand forming which is typically integrated into the production process. Utilizing the finite element technique, several forming operations are eliminated thus reducing the cost and time for manufacturing. A single forming operation is used by developing the die configuration for the “ 7075 -W ” extrusion and by determining the optimum forming parameters. Reduction in process steps is accomplished while additional hand forming operations are eliminated. The FEA model results are compared against experimental forming data to determine accuracy. Catia robotic solid models {{are used to}} verify the dynamic boundary conditions needed for the finite element setup and solution. Net and developed extrusion test dies {{were used for the}} FEA comparisons. ...|$|E
40|$|Thin {{cylindrical}} shells {{are commonly}} employed in civil and structural applications {{in which the}} dominant loading condition is global bending. In applications such as wind turbine towers and offshore piles, {{the design of the}} structure is commonly limited by buckling. The traditional approach to improving buckling strength pursuant of greater design economy is to use steel ring and/or axial stiffeners. However, the total steel tonnage may be reduced with stiffeners, but the additional fabrication costs can limit the cost advantage. Meanwhile, it has long been observed in the silo industry that granular filled cylinders exhibit strength gains due to the internal pressure and stiffness of the granular bulk solid against the shell wall. For large diameter fabricated steel tubes in bending, an elastic granular fill may be useful in replacing ring stiffeners, increasing critical buckling moments, and reducing risk by providing more stable postbuckling behaviour. However, the strength gains related to the elastic stiffness of a granular core has received very little attention and has been limited to the axial loading condition. In the project work, the candidate uses theoretical and computational methods to investigate the effects of an elastic granular fill on the buckling strength of cylindrical shells subject to global bending. In particular, cylinders in the <b>elastic-plastic</b> <b>range</b> will be considered in order to represent applications such as wind turbine towers and offshore piles. Effects of an elastic bulk fill on strength gains and imperfection sensitivity are considered with interest in improving design economy. </p...|$|E

Little attention, however, has been directed at providing sinrple,genersl methcds which cam be applied by the engineer towsrd the solution of prac-tical problems. This report presents such a method snd its applications to several problems of current interest. Although use is made of a technique aristig in the theory of integral equatims, no knowledge of integral equations is required, and the math-tics involved is welJ. within the scope of the practicing engineer.

40|$|Abstract-An {{effort is}} made to cover the full <b>elastic-plastic</b> <b>range</b> from the very {{troublesome}} fractures which initiate and propagate at nominal or net stress well down in the elastic range to the common yet more easily understandable and preventable fractures at fully plastic or limit load conditions. Similarities and differences of behavior between steels which are highly rate-sensitive and aluminum alloys or other rather insensitive materials are examined. The very marked distinctions between the very special extremes of plane stress and plane strain are brought out along with their relevance {{to the failure of}} complex structures and elements. In contrast, the need to consider bending in most shell structures is emphasized. A demonstration is given of the likelihood in the laboratory, but even more so in the field, of confusing limit load fractures with low stress fractures. Crack extension under plane strain conditions is studied in some detail, and the important role of progressive blunting is indicated both in limiting maximum achievable stresses and providing a small region of intense strain in which ductile fracture mechanisms are operative. Comparison with appropriate microstructural dimensions leads to a rationale for minimum thickness dimensions for plane strain fracture. Plane stress yield patterns in cracked sheets are shown to be greatly sensitive to the yield criterion. The line plastic zone Dugdale model provides a correct solution for a non-hardening Tresca material, but diffuse zones result for a Mises material. The important role of thickness direction anisotropy is indicated. Stable extension under increasing load appears as a possible consequence of crack advance into previously deformed material. Conditions for stable vs. abrupt growth, the appropriateness of energy balance approaches, and plastic limit load calculations are also studied. An attempt {{is made to}} place all in perspective...|$|E
40|$|Thesis {{deals with}} finite element (FE) {{simulation}} of borehole jack (BHJ) tests in ice. The {{purpose of the}} thesis was to simulate <b>elastic-plastic</b> <b>range</b> shown in BHJ tests, compare measured ice stiffnesses with obtained from simulations, fit plastic range, investigate plastic properties and stress descending in surrounding ice. Eight BHJ tests carried out at different depths of different boreholes in the first-year ice ridge have been taken for simulation. Tests were performed in ice blocks of sail and in consolidated layer. Two-dimensional (2 -D) and three-dimensional (3 -D) models were developed in FE program Abaqus 6. 8 - 2. Plane strain situation was assumed in 2 -D model. In reality this can correspond to the BHJ test at the depth of sufficient ice confinement. 3 -D model considered thicknesses of ice blocks. Elastic moduli obtained in uniaxial tests of samples taken {{in the vicinity of}} the BHJ tests were used as a material input. The ice in simulation was assumed isotropic, because of severe distortion, and independent of strain rate, since it is not known at the beginning of the test. Simulations were carried out up to the measured peak stresses, softening and fracture of the ice was not covered. Stiffnesses obtained in 2 -D simulations were lower than the measured, average error was 27. 1 %, while 3 -D model gave stiffnesses in general higher and average error was 55. 8 %, however high value of the error is governed mainly by two results. Stiffnesses simulated with 2 -D and 3 -D models showed the same pattern as elastic moduli. It was shown that the thinner ice confinement of BHJ leads to the lower stiffnesses, and 2 -D model could not take this fact into account. Fitting of <b>elastic-plastic</b> <b>range</b> was carried out with 3 -D model, therefore lower values of elastic moduli had to be taken for fitting of elastic range. Some facts, which could lead to lower measured values of in situ stiffness, are discussed: interpretation of BHJ output pressure-displacement diagram, action of BHJ on both sides of the borehole. Introducing of plastic hardening was required for fitting of measured curves up the peak stresses, thinner confinement required higher degree of hardening. Fitting of measured diagrams required introducing of input materials with peak stresses in average 1. 8 times higher than the ones of corresponding brittle uniaxial specimens. It was shown that to some extend plastic hardening in BHJ tests is due to confinement of surrounding ice. And also concluded that testing conditions could increase the brittleness of uniaxial samples, therefore plastic range in uniaxial samples was not shown. Stress descending in 2 -D and 3 -D models showed profile similar to the theoretical solution of stress descending in the circular plate with a concentric hole with internal pressure. 3 -D model showed closer profile. Obtained results had good correspondence with the measured value. In experiment of Barrault and Strub-Klein (2009), at the distance of 4 borehole diameters stress descended down to 2 % of stress measured by BHJ, while it was 3. 6 % in 2 -D, 0. 4 % in 3 -D model, theoretical approach gave 1. 2 %. Therefore it is possible to conclude that theoretical approach can be used for preliminary estimations of stress descending quite safely. Many uncertainties arose due to the fact that input used for BHJ tests simulation was taken from the BHJ tests performed in the sea ice ridge. Simulation of BHJ tests carried out in the level ice of known thickness, with input material parameters obtained from the field testing will help to validate numerical model. Introduction of fracture mechanics in the model is also required for further improvements.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{the author}} investigates the behaviour of reinforced and prestressed concrete waffle slabs from initial to collapse load. The theoretical treatment covering {{the whole range}} of load, is divided into three parts: elastic analysis, ultimate analysis, and progressive failure analysis. The elastic analysis part is based on a Fourier series solution for simply supported slabs and this is extended to continuous waffle slab structures. The ultimate limit state analysis is obtained by adopting the yield line theory as an upper bound solution. The progressive failure analysis is tackled by the finite element method as a numerical technique; beyond the initiation of the first crack at sections of maximum stresses, an iterative incremental procedure is adopted {{to take into account the}} reduction of rigidities with the corresponding increment of loading, thus converting the non-linear problem into a series of incrementally linear problems in the <b>elastic-plastic</b> <b>range.</b> Comparison of results is made between skew and rectangular waffle slabs as well as between continuous slabs on isolated supports and on continuous line-supports. A study of the effect of rotating the isolated column support line about the center of the bridge on the structural response is undertaken. The theoretical analyses are substantiated and verified by experimental results obtained from tests on seven models of reinforced and prestressed concrete waffle slab bridges. The deflections and strains obtained from the tests are found to be in good agreement with the theoretical solutions. From this study it is concluded that the yield-line analysis is simple and reliable in predicting the ultimate load of waffle slab structures. Furthermore, prestressed concrete waffle slab construction is well suited for use in large span structures. Also, in predicting the collapse load of waffle slab structures, it is found that the progressive failure analysis of such structures gives results which are in close agreement with those obtained from the tests as well as from the yield-line analysis.

40|$|In this paper, the {{structural}} responses of reinforced concrete (RC) beams subjected to blast loading are investigated. In particular, RC beams {{with a low}} reinforcement ratio are examined, which {{are more likely to}} fail in flexure than in shear. In order to assess the response of the beam, two analytical approaches are developed. In the first one, the beam is modeled as a continuous element by means of Euler-Bernoulli’s theory, which neglects the contributions of shear deformation and rotary inertia. The nonlinear behaviour of the beam in the <b>elastic-plastic</b> <b>range</b> is approximated by a single smooth relationship between bending moment and curvature, which allows to derive an original expression of the differential equation of motion of the beam. The parameters appearing in the latter are easily determined from the geometric and constitutive properties of the beam. The second approach described in this paper consists in evaluating the response of the beam through an equivalent single degree of freedom (SDOF) system. The latter is a mass-spring oscillator, and its constitutive behaviour is expressed through a bilateral relationship between force and displacement. The main drawback of this simplified approach is the need to introduce empirical quantities, such as the equivalent mass and the length of the plastic hinge. In both approaches, strain rate effects are taken into account. In fact, these effects should not be ignored in problems concerning blast loads, since the mechanical properties of both concrete and steel strongly depend on the rate of deformation. In this paper, strain rate effects are considered by changing the parameters related to the material properties during time, in accordance with the rules provided by the CEB Information Bulletin n. 187 and the fib Bulletin n. 55. Finally, in order to test the validity of the two approaches, the theoretical results are compared with some experimental data found in literature. In particular, the time-histories of the maximum deflections of several simply supported RC beams under uniformly distributed loads generated by explosions are analyzed. It is shown that the first approach is capable of predicting both the maximum displacement time-history and the deflection at collapse of any beam accurately. On the other hand, the second approach gives a less precise assessment of {{the structural}} response of the beam; nonetheless, the method based on the equivalent SDOF model is simpler to use and its differential equation of motion is faster to integrate...|$|E
40|$|Most machine {{components}} and structural members {{are subjected to}} complex loading conditions during service. Typical complex loading conditions {{can be observed in}} the case of a bolt When a bolt is tightened to bring {{machine components}} together, stresses such as tensile stress (clamp load/area), and torsional or shear stresses (proportional to applied torque) are developed in the shank and bolt threads. To simplify the complex relationship between tightening torque, friction co-efficient and the preload in the fastener, a circular rod is chosen to represent the problem. Investigations were carried out to determine 1) how the external tensile load affects the magnitude of the initially applied torque, and 11) how application of torque affects the initially applied axial load or preload in a specimen in <b>elastic-plastic</b> <b>range.</b> A preliminary study on copper specimens was undertaken to gain knowledge about elastic-plastic behaviour under combined tension and tors ion loading. Various combinations of combined tension and tors ion loading conditions were applied on the specimens to establish the proper functioning of a recommissioned tension- torsion machine and a dedicated Lab VIEW program. Experimental investigations on AlSiC MMC rod specimens reveal that the rod can sustain combined axial load and torque well beyond the combined initial yield curve When the specimen is subjected to an ini tial axial load or torque followed by torque or axial load respectively, the subsequent load or torque becomes dominant in describing the elastic-plastic behaviour of the specimen. The initial load or torque in the specimen does not af fect the subsequent torque or load car rying capaci ty of the specimen. A specimen subjected to a constant relative extension and angle of twist can sustain the combined axial load and torque well beyond the combined initial yield curve. It is apparent that the specimen carries relatively higher axial load when the load-torque path is closer to the axial load axis Similarly, the specimen carries relatively higher torque when the load- torque path is closer to the torque axis. In addition to the experimental investigation, a comprehensive finite element modelling of combined tension and torsion loading of a model was under taken that includes both geometric as well as large deformation effects for capturing axial and shear stresses. A methodology for the finite element analysis of solid rods under combined tension and torsion loads was developed. The numerical models have success fully captured the basic features of the elastic-plastic response of the AlSiC metal matrix composite and demonstrated the effect of particle inclusion in the overall flow properties of the composite, while demonstrating some limitations...|$|E
40|$|The {{specialty}} section Earthquake Engineering is one {{branch of}} Frontiers in Built Environment and welcomes critical and in-depth submissions on earthquake ground motions {{and their effects}} on buildings and infrastructures. Manuscripts should yield new insights and ultimately contribute to a safer and more reliable design of building structures and infrastructures. The scope includes the characterization of earthquake ground motions (e. g. near-fault, far-fault, short-period, long-period), their underlying properties, their intrinsic relationship with structural responses, and the true behaviors of building structures and infrastructures under risky and uncertain ground motions. More specific topics include recorded ground motions, generated ground motions, response spectra, stochastic modeling of ground motion, critical excitation, geotechnical aspects, soil mechanics, soil liquefaction, soil-structure interactions, pile foundations, earthquake input energy, structural control, passive control, active control, base-isolation, steel structures, reinforced concrete structures, wood structures, building retrofit, structural optimization, uncertainty analysis, robustness analysis, and redundancy analysis. This eBook includes four original research papers, {{in addition to the}} Specialty Grand Challenge article, on the critical earthquake response of elastic-plastic structures under near-fault or long-duration ground motions which were published in the specialty section Earthquake Engineering. In the early stage of dynamic nonlinear response analysis of structures around 1960 s, a simple hysteretic structural model and a simple sinusoidal earthquake ground motion input were dealt with together with random inputs. The steady-state response was tackled by an equivalent linearization method developed by Caughey, Iwan and others. In fact, the resonance {{plays a key role in}} the earthquake-resistant design and it has a strong effect even in case of near-fault ground motions. In order to draw the steady-state response curve and investigate the resonant property, two kinds of repetition have to be introduced. One is a cycle, for one forced input frequency, of the initial guess of the steady-state response amplitude, the construction of the equivalent linear model, the analysis of the steady-state response amplitude using the equivalent linear model and the update of the equivalent linear model based on the computed steady-state response amplitude. The other is the sweeping over a range of forced input frequencies. This process is quite tedious. Four original research papers included in this eBook propose a new approach to overcome this difficulty. Kojima and Takewaki demonstrated that the elastic-plastic response as continuation of free-vibrations under impulse input can be derived in a closed form by a sophisticated energy approach without solving directly the equations of motion as differential equations. While, as pointed out above, the approach based on the equivalent linearization method requires the repetition of application of the linearized equations, the method by Kojima and Takewaki does not need any repetition. The double impulse, triple impulse and multiple impulses enable us to describe directly the critical timing of impulses (resonant frequency) which is not easy for the sinusoidal and other inputs without a repetitive procedure. It is important to note that, while most of the previous methods employ the equivalent linearization of the structural model with the input unchanged, the method treated in this eBook transforms the input into a series of impulses with the structural model unchanged. This characteristic guarantees high accuracy and reliability even in the large plastic deformation range. The approach presented in this eBook is an epoch-making accomplishment to open the door for simpler and deeper understanding of structural reliability of built environments in the <b>elastic-plastic</b> <b>range...</b>|$|E
