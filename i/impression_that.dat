5|$|Ambassador Bishop clearly {{explained}} his rationale {{to the security}} detail, which was to avoid any <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> they were intervening in the violence in Mogadishu. He feared that the embassy would be targeted by organized attacks if any group involved in the clashes got the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> the US was intervening in the conflict. To this effect, he requested the Voice of America and BBC broadcast announcements that the forces were present only to evacuate the embassy and would not interfere in the conflict. The Marines who had been doused in fuel during the refueling {{were able to take}} a shower and wash their clothes.|$|E

5|$|Critics {{praised the}} film's hard-line look at racism and Fuller's use of melodrama and metaphors {{to present his}} argument, and its {{somewhat}} disheartening ending that leaves the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> while racism is learned, it cannot be cured. Reviewers consistently questioned the film's lack of wide release in the United States when it was completed and applauded its belated release by Criterion.|$|E

5|$|In mid-May, Nixon, {{interviewed by}} David Broder of The Washington Post, {{mentioned}} the Maryland governor {{as a possible}} running mate. As Agnew continued to meet with Nixon and with the candidate's senior aides, there was a growing <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> he was moving into the Nixon camp. At the same time, Agnew denied any political ambitions beyond serving his full four-year term as governor.|$|E

5|$|Magnetic Hill is on {{the northwestern}} {{outskirts}} of Moncton {{and is now the}} city's most famous attraction. It is a gravity hill optical illusion, where the local topography gives the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> you are going uphill when in fact you are going downhill.|$|E
5|$|Many {{fish have}} eyespots near their tails, {{a form of}} automimicry, to {{distract}} attacks away from the vulnerable head and eye. For example, Chaetodon capistratus has both a (disruptive) eyestripe to conceal the eye, and a large eyespot near its tail, giving the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> the head is {{at the tail end}} of the body.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton {{had given}} Mackintosh the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> he would if {{possible}} attempt his crossing during the coming 1914–15 Antarctic season. Before departing for the Weddell Sea, {{he changed his}} mind about the feasibility of this timescale. Mackintosh was not informed of this change of plan; this misunderstanding led to the underprepared and near-chaotic depot-laying journeys of January–March 1915.|$|E

5|$|The diversionary attacks went well, with Soviet forces acting {{under the}} <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> the Poles had targets other than Vilnius. Despite their diversionary intent, these attacks succeeded {{in their own}} right, with Generał Józef Adam Lasocki taking Lida in two days despite {{unexpectedly}} strong resistance, and Generał Stefan Mokrzecki taking Nowogrodek in three days and Baranowicze in four.|$|E
5|$|The {{statements}} {{cited by}} Universal {{recognize that the}} Donkey Kong theme loosely evokes the King Kong films.

5|$|A farmworker heard Jeremy leave around 9:30 pm. Barbara Wilson, the farm's secretary, telephoned Nevill {{at around}} that time, and {{was left with}} the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> she had {{interrupted}} an argument. She said he was short with her and seemed to hang up in irritation, something he had never done before; he was by all accounts an even-tempered man. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, telephoned around 10 pm. She spoke to Sheila, who she said was quiet, then to June, who seemed normal.|$|E

Hương had actually privately endorsed the dissolution of the HNC, as both he and the Young Turks thought it would allow them to gain more power and influence over Khánh.|$|E
5|$|By 1:30 pm, around 1,000 monks had congregated {{inside to}} hold a meeting while outside a large crowd of pro-Buddhist {{students}} had formed a human barrier around it. The meeting soon ended and all but a hundred monks slowly left the compound. Nearly one thousand monks, accompanied by laypeople, returned to the cremation site. The police lingered nearby. At around 6:00 pm, thirty nuns and six monks were arrested for holding a prayer meeting on the street outside Xá Lợi. The police encircled the pagoda, blocking public passage and giving observers the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> an armed siege was imminent by donning riot gear.|$|E
5|$|Dalmazzo urged Roatta {{to expand}} Italian links with Serb {{nationalist}} groups into {{an alliance with}} them. At this time, the Italians were looking for allies to restore order, fight the Partisans, and support their political claims to NDH territory, and were under the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> the various Serb nationalist groups were far better organised than they actually were. For example, Roatta was under the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> Jevđević represented the Herzegovinian Chetniks, {{and that they were}} aligned with Dangić. In early March, Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin suddenly told the Italians that they were effectively in control of a Chetnik movement, and were ready to collaborate with the Italians on the latter's terms. Jevđević sent a message to Dalmazzo explaining that the Herzegovinian Chetniks wanted to avenge Todorović and were concentrating around Nevesinje ready to demonstrate their loyalty to the Italians. Despite their statements, Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin faced significant difficulties; the Serb nationalist groups had yet to demonstrate their military value to the Italians, and not all of the armed groups even acknowledged their leadership.|$|E

5|$|Early grunge concerts were sparsely {{attended}} (many by {{fewer than}} a dozen people) but Sub Pop photographer Charles Peterson's pictures helped create the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> such concerts were major events. Mudhoney, which was formed by former members of Green River, served as the flagship band of Sub Pop during their entire time with the label and spearheaded the Seattle grunge movement. Other record labels in the Pacific Northwest that helped promote grunge included C/Z Records, Estrus Records, EMpTy Records and PopLlama Records.|$|E
5|$|General Mack {{thought that}} Austrian {{security}} relied on sealing off the gaps through the mountainous Black Forest area in Southern Germany that had witnessed much fighting during the campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars. Mack {{believed that there}} would be no action in Central Germany. Mack decided to make the city of Ulm the centerpiece of his defensive strategy, which called for a containment of the French until the Russians under Kutuzov could arrive and alter the odds against Napoleon. Ulm was protected by the heavily fortified Michelsberg heights, giving Mack the <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> the city was virtually impregnable from outside attack.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{a second}} Order in Council, the British Indian Ocean Territory (Constitution) Order 2004, was produced, again {{reinstating}} the off-limits {{nature of the}} Chagos Islands.
