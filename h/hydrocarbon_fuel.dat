25|$|Hydrogen's low {{viscosity}} and high thermal conductivity {{make it the}} most powerful working gas, primarily because the engine can run faster than with other gases. However, because of hydrogen absorption, and given the high diffusion rate associated with this low molecular weight gas, particularly at high temperatures, H2 leaks through the solid metal of the heater. Diffusion through carbon steel is too high to be practical, but may be acceptably low for metals such as aluminum, or even stainless steel. Certain ceramics also greatly reduce diffusion. Hermetic pressure vessel seals are necessary to maintain pressure inside the engine without replacement of lost gas. For high temperature differential (HTD) engines, auxiliary systems {{may need to be}} added to maintain high pressure working fluid. These systems can be a gas storage bottle or a gas generator. Hydrogen can be generated by electrolysis of water, the action of steam on red hot carbon-based fuel, by gasification of <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>fuel,</b> or by the reaction of acid on metal. Hydrogen can also cause the embrittlement of metals. Hydrogen is a flammable gas, which is a safety concern if released from the engine.|$|E
2500|$|Cold Fire, is an organic, {{eco-friendly}} {{wetting agent}} that works by cooling, and by encapsulating the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>fuel,</b> which prevents it from entering into the combustion reaction. Bulk Cold Fire {{is used in}} booster tanks and is acceptable for use in CAFS systems. Cold Fire is UL listed for A and B fires only, though the manufacturer claims it is effective on class D and [...] "grease" [...] fires, which implies class K capability. End users should be cautious about agents use on fires outside of their UL listing, despite sales claims. Aerosol versions are preferred by users for cars, boats, RVs, and kitchens. Used primarily by law enforcement, fire departments, EMS, and the racing industry across North America. Cold Fire offers Amerex equipment (converted 252 and 254 models), as well as imported equipment in smaller sizes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Endothermic <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>fuels</b> are {{advanced}} coolants for high-temperature {{structures of}} spacecraft. No data of tested-cooling-ability of endothermic fuels have been broadly discussed in literature. In this work a high-temperature flow calo-rimeter was designed, and the cooling capacity of six different <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>fuels</b> were measured. Experimental {{results showed that}} these <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>fuels</b> have capacity for cooling high-temperature structures, and that the cooling capacity of fuel N- 1 can reach 3. 15 MJ/kg, which can nearly satisfy the requirement of thermal management for a Mach 3 cruise aircraft, whose heat sink re-quirement is about 3. 5 MJ/kg. The endothermic velocity of <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>fuels</b> was also measured by the calorimeter...|$|R
2500|$|This is {{the area}} of {{greatest}} success for current energy storage technologies. [...] Single-use and rechargeable batteries are ubiquitous, and provide power for devices with demands as varied as digital watches and cars. [...] Advances in battery technology have generally been slow, however, {{with much of the}} advance in battery life that consumers see being attributable to efficient power management rather than increased storage capacity. Portable consumer electronics have benefited greatly from size and power reductions associated with Moore's law. Unfortunately, Moore's law does not apply to hauling people and freight; the underlying energy requirements for transportation remain much higher than for information and entertainment applications. Battery capacity has become an issue as pressure grows for alternatives to internal combustion engines in cars, trucks, buses, trains, ships, and aeroplanes. [...] These uses require far more energy density (the amount of energy stored in a given volume or weight) than current battery technology can deliver. Liquid <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>fuel</b> (such as gasoline/petrol and diesel), as well as alcohols (methanol, ethanol, and butanol) and lipids (straight vegetable oil, biodiesel) have much higher energy densities.|$|E
