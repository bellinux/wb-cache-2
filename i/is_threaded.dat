25|$|These are baby {{carriers}} {{that use}} dynamic tension, {{a length of}} cloth and metal (such as aluminum) or nylon rings. One end of the cloth is sewn to two rings. The cloth wraps around the wearer's body from shoulder to opposite hip and {{back up to the}} shoulder, and the end <b>is</b> <b>threaded</b> through the rings to create a buckle effect. The baby sits or lies in the resulting pocket. Once a sling <b>is</b> <b>threaded,</b> it can be taken off and put back on without rethreading. A threaded sling forms a loop of cloth. The wearer can put one arm and the head through the loop of cloth to put the sling back on.|$|E
25|$|Some rinks use harness {{systems to}} help skaters learn new jumps in a {{controlled}} manner. The ice rink installs a heavy-duty cable that is securely attached to two walls of the rink. A set of pulleys ride on the cable. The skater wears a vest or belt that has a cable or rope attached to it. That cable/rope <b>is</b> <b>threaded</b> through the movable pulley on the cable above. The coach holds {{the other end of}} the cable and lifts the skater by pulling the cable/rope. The skater can then practice the jump with the coach assisting the completion.|$|E

25|$|A {{disadvantage}} of post mounts {{is that the}} bolt <b>is</b> <b>threaded</b> directly into the fork lowers. If the threads are stripped or if the bolt is stuck, then the threads {{will need to be}} repaired, or the seized bolt drilled out. Frame manufacturers have standardized the IS mount for the rear disc brake mount. In recent years post mount has gained ground and is becoming more common. This is mostly due to decreased manufacturing and part cost for the brake calipers when using post mount. A limitation of the mount is that the location of the rotor is more constrained: it is possible to encounter incompatible hub/fork combinations, where the rotor is out of range.|$|E
25|$|Hamstring autografts {{are made}} with the semitendinosus tendon, either alone or {{accompanied}} by the gracilis tendon for a stronger graft. The semitendinosus is an accessory hamstring (the primary hamstrings are left intact), and the gracilis is not a hamstring, but an accessory adductor (the primary adductors are left intact as well). The two tendons are commonly combined and {{referred to as a}} four-strand hamstring graft, made by a long piece (about 25cm) removed from each tendon. The tendon segments are folded and braided together to form a tendon of quadruple thickness for the graft. The braided segment <b>is</b> <b>threaded</b> through the heads of the tibia and femur, and its ends are fixed with screws on the opposite sides of the two bones.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} version are two-sided bags, either joined {{round the}} edges or folded and joined along two sides. Webbing straps may be stitched to doubler patches {{which are then}} glued or welded to the bag on light duty bags, but on large and heavy duty bags there are usually strips of bag material bonded to the bags which form flat retaining tubes for the webbing which <b>is</b> <b>threaded</b> through the tubes and may be withdrawn for maintenance and inspection. heavy duty open bags are generally conical with a domed top or a reversed truncated cone top, and may have several straps from the lifting point at the bottom, through the guide tubes on the sides, to a crown ring of webbing or steel at the top, to spread the load evenly over {{the fabric of the}} bag.|$|E

25|$|The bowl {{in which}} the drink is {{prepared}} is called a tanoa or laulau. The former word is the more frequently used. The bowls vary in size from twelve to thirty inches and they stand on short rounded legs varying in number from four to twentyfour. It is unusual to find a bowl that has a greater depth than six inches and the majority are perhaps not more than three or four inches deep. A brim of a width varying according {{to the size of}} the bowl runs round the top of the tanoa, and a flange or sometimes a projecting piece of the original wood is left under the bowl. This is pierced by a hole through which a piece of afa (native sennit) <b>is</b> <b>threaded</b> for suspending the bowl from a house post. The tanoa is usually made from the wood of the ifilele tree (Intsia bijuga), a hard-grained timber of a reddish-brown colour. When the bowl was finished it was soaked in fresh water for a considerable time to remove the woody smell. 'Ava often was also allowed to remain indefinitely in the tanoa in order that the inside might acquire an enamelled appearance. This enamel or sheen is called tane. In earlier bowls the legs were tapered towards the bottom and reduced there to about a half an inch in diameter. Chiefs and orators, high and low, use the same type of tanoa. At ceremonies, the bowl used is that belonging to the chief or orator at whose house the ceremony is being held.|$|E

The 7/8" [...] zoom ring is made of raised rubber ridges and operates over a 75 degree turning radius. The focus ring is similarly constructed with more closely spaced ridges and a 100 degrees of turning action. The ridges of both rings are parallel to the lens.|$|E
500|$|The {{construction}} of a bucket bong (or simply a [...] "bucket") calls for a large plastic bottle (about [...] ), a large bucket or other container that both the bottle and {{a large amount of}} water will properly go into, a brass cut nozzle used as the bowl, an aerator screen cut to fit the bowl, and a large bucket or container. The large plastic bottle's base is cut off, and the bottle's cap has a small hole in the center which will eventually hold a bowl. The screen is placed inside of the bowl. The cut nozzle <b>is</b> <b>threaded</b> into the hole outside the cap.|$|E

Little and Roderic (Stan) Dallas, flew with the British Royal Naval Air Service and Royal Air Force). His record as an ace wearing the Australian uniform has remained unbeaten. [...] Air Marshal Sir Richard Williams, Director General of Civil Aviation from 1946 to 1955 and widely regarded as the [...] "Father of the RAAF", described Cobby as [...] "a man whose personal story <b>is</b> <b>threaded</b> through the entire history of Australian service and civil aviation". One of the aluminium cutouts of Charlie Chaplin that Cobby attached to his Sopwith Camel in World WarI later went on show at RAAF Museum, Point Cook, and the tail skid of one of his victims was displayed at the Australian War Memorial, Canberra. Cobby Street, in the Canberra suburb of Campbell, is named in his honour.|$|E

2500|$|A rotaxane is a {{mechanically}} interlocked molecular architecture {{consisting of}} a [...] "dumbbell shaped molecule" [...] which <b>is</b> <b>threaded</b> through a [...] "macrocycle" [...] (see graphical representation). The name {{is derived from the}} Latin for wheel (rota) and axle (axis). The two components of a rotaxane are kinetically trapped since the ends of the dumbbell (often called stoppers) are larger than the internal diameter of the ring and prevent dissociation (unthreading) of the components since this would require significant distortion of the covalent bonds.|$|E
2500|$|A common {{method of}} {{threading}} is cutting with taps and dies. Unlike drill bits, hand taps do not automatically remove the chips they create. [...] A hand tap cannot cut its threads {{in a single}} rotation because it creates long chips which quickly jam the tap (an effect known as [...] "crowding"), possibly breaking it. [...] Therefore, in manual thread cutting, normal wrench usage is to cut the threads 1/2 to 2/3 of a turn (180 to 240 degree rotation), then reverse the tap for about 1/6 of a turn (60 degrees) until the chips are broken by the back edges of the cutters. [...] It {{may be necessary to}} periodically remove the tap from the hole to clear the chips, especially when a blind hole <b>is</b> <b>threaded.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The main {{characteristic}} of stud earrings is {{the appearance of}} floating on the ear or earlobe without a visible (from the front) point of connection. [...] Studs are invariably constructed {{on the end of}} a post, which penetrates straight through the ear or earlobe. [...] The post is held in place by a removable friction back or clutch. [...] A stud earring features a gemstone or other ornament mounted on a narrow post that passes through a piercing in the ear or earlobe, and is held in place by a fixture on the other side. Studs commonly come in the form of solitaire diamonds. Some stud earrings are constructed so that the post <b>is</b> <b>threaded,</b> allowing a screw back to hold the earring in place securely, which is useful in preventing the loss of expensive earrings containing precious stones, or made of precious metals.|$|E

2500|$|The {{drum shell}} {{is made of}} hard wood, perhaps walnut or chestnut, though many woods may be in use {{depending}} on the region where the drum is made. [...] To make the shell, the wood is boiled in water to make it bendable, and then it is bent into a cylindrical shape and fastened together. [...] The heads are usually goat skin, and they are shaped into circles by wooden frames. [...] However, one head may be goat skin to provide a higher tone, while the other head can be sheepskin, calfskin, or even donkey-skin to provide a lower tone. [...] Some say that wolf skin and even dog skin are preferred. [...] Rope threaded {{back and forth across}} the shell of the drum, from head to head in a zigzag pattern, holds the heads on the drum and provides tension for tuning the drum. [...] Sometimes metal rings or leather straps join neighboring strands of the rope in order to allow for further tuning. [...] Two rings are sometimes attached to the main rope where a belt-like rope <b>is</b> <b>threaded</b> through to hold the drum.|$|E
2500|$|The novel {{comments}} on {{the differences between the}} British and French structures of social class. The St. Caux family is part of the French nobility, while Harry is the son of a doctor and a member of a large family that often experiences financial difficulties in caring for all of the children. The contrast between British and French social classes is often directly addressed: the French class system is more deeply and strictly divided than the British, who are described as having less distinct class divisions. And in the historical setting of the French Revolution, the animosity between the aristocracy and the French peasantry is apparent – much of the St. Caux family are killed for the sake of their aristocratic status. Harry, himself a middle-class English boy, [...] "sympathizes with the oppressed peasantry but tries to protect his adoptive noble French family from the terror." [...] The theme of class divisions <b>is</b> <b>threaded</b> with nationalistic rhetoric: Harry’s father states that “the condition of the vast body of the French nation has been terrible,” and that England, in contrast, has “long conquered our liberties.” ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{a variety}} of reasons, many cyclists choose to convert {{freewheel}} bicycles to fixed gear. Frames with horizontal dropouts are straightforward to convert, frames with vertical dropouts less so. One method is to simply replace the rear wheel with a wheel that has a track/fixed hub. Another {{is to use a}} hub designed for use with a threaded multi-speed freewheel. [...] Such a hub only has the normal right-handed threads for the cog and not the reverse threads for the lockrings used on track/fixed hubs. [...] The sprocket on a hub without a lockring may unscrew while back pedalling. Even if a bottom bracket lockring <b>is</b> <b>threaded</b> onto the hub, along with a track sprocket, because the bottom-bracket lockring is not reverse threaded, the possibility still exists that both the sprocket and locknut can unscrew. [...] Therefore, it is recommended to have both front and rear brakes on a fixed-gear bicycle using a converted freewheel hub in case the cog unscrews while back pedaling. It is also advisable to use a thread sealer for the cog and bottom bracket locking. The rotafix (or [...] "frame whipping") method may be helpful to securely install the sprocket.|$|E
