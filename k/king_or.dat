5|$|George held {{a number}} of titles {{throughout}} his life, as successively great-grandson, grandson and son of the monarch.

5|$|A clay tablet {{found in}} ancient Iraq that {{promoted}} more advanced agricultural techniques is sometimes considered {{the first known}} example of public relations. Babylonian, Egyptian and Persian leaders created pyramids, obelisks and statues to promote their divine right to lead. Additionally, claims of magic or religious authority were used to persuade the public of a <b>king</b> <b>or</b> pharaoh's right to rule.|$|E

5|$|At {{the head}} of Macedonia's {{government}} was the king (basileus). From at least the reign of PhilipII, the king was assisted by the royal pages (basilikoi paides), bodyguards (somatophylakes), companions (hetairoi), friends (philoi), an assembly that included members of the military, and (during the Hellenistic period) magistrates. Evidence is lacking regarding {{the extent to which}} each of these groups shared authority with the <b>king</b> <b>or</b> if their existence had a basis in a formal constitutional framework. Before the reign of PhilipII, the only institution supported by textual evidence is the monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Building {{a castle}} {{sometimes}} required {{the permission of}} the <b>king</b> <b>or</b> other high authority. In 864 the King of West Francia, Charles the Bald, prohibited the construction of castella without his permission and ordered them all to be destroyed. This is perhaps the earliest reference to castles, though military historian R. Allen Brown points out that the word castella may have applied to any fortification at the time.|$|E
5|$|Eddard Stark awakens in his {{chambers}} with Robert Baratheon and Cersei Lannister watching him. Cersei accuses Eddard {{of kidnapping}} her brother, Tyrion, and claims Eddard was drunk and attacked Jaime first, {{but she is}} silenced by a slap from Robert. After she leaves, Robert tells Eddard that he cannot rule the kingdoms if the Lannisters and Starks are at war and insists that Eddard remain the Hand of the <b>King,</b> <b>or</b> else Robert will give the position to Jaime. Robert also informs Eddard {{that he will be}} regent while Robert is away on a hunting trip.|$|E

Iberian aristocracy, often called a [...] "senate" [...] by the ancient sources, met in a council of nobles. <b>Kings</b> <b>or</b> chieftains would maintain their forces through a system of obligation or vassalage that the Romans termed [...] "fides".|$|R
5|$|Edward's {{relationship}} with Gaveston inspired Christopher Marlowe's 1592 play Edward II, {{along with other}} plays, films, novels and media. Many of these {{have focused on the}} possible sexual relationship between the two men. Edward's contemporaries criticised his performance as a king, noting his failures in Scotland and the oppressive regime of his later years, although 19th-century academics later argued that the growth of parliamentary institutions during his reign was a positive development for England over the longer term. Debate has continued into the 21st century as to whether Edward was a lazy and incompetent <b>king,</b> <b>or</b> simply a reluctant and ultimately unsuccessful ruler.|$|E
5|$|In 1600 Lew Sapieha led a Commonwealth {{mission to}} Moscow {{to propose a}} union with the Russian state, {{patterned}} after the Polish–Lithuanian Union, with the boyars granted rights comparable {{with those of the}} Commonwealth's nobility. A decision on a single monarch was to be postponed until the death of the current <b>king</b> <b>or</b> tsar. Boris Godunov, at that time also engaged in negotiations with Charles of Sweden, wasn't interested in that close a relationship and only a twenty-year truce was agreed upon in 1602.|$|E

The kingdom of the evil Diamond <b>King,</b> <b>or</b> Hirok Raj, is an allusion to India during Indira Gandhi's emergency period. Along with his acclaimed short film Pikoo (Pikoo's Diary) and hour-long Hindi film, Sadgati, this {{was the culmination of}} his work in this period.|$|E

5|$|The government's income {{came from}} five {{principal}} sources: regular taxes, occasional taxes, fines, income taxes, miscellaneous taxes and tributes from feudatories. An emergency tax was imposed occasionally and were applicable when the kingdom was under duress, {{such as when}} it faced natural calamities, or was preparing for war or overcoming war's ravages. Income tax included taxes on crown land, wasteland, specific types of trees considered valuable to the economy, mines, salt, treasures unearthed by prospectors. Additionally, customary presents {{were given to the}} <b>king</b> <b>or</b> royal officers on such festive occasions as marriage or the birth of a son.|$|E
5|$|The keep {{is unusual}} {{both for the}} period and for Devon as a whole, being a very strong {{defensive}} structure, albeit without any independent source of water or facilities to support a garrison {{in the event of}} a siege. Other rectangular 11th century keeps in Devon existed, including at Exter and Lydford, and were typically associated with the <b>king</b> <b>or</b> major nobles. Few were built on top of fresh mottes, as at Okehampton, and this may have been made possible in this case because the motte was largely natural and therefore able to support the heavy weight.|$|E

5|$|The size of {{the squares}} of the {{chessboard}} should be approximately 1.25 to 1.3 times {{the diameter of the}} base of the <b>king,</b> <b>or</b> 50 to 65mm.

5|$|Æthelberht's reign {{may have}} begun in 779, the date {{provided}} {{for the beginning of}} his reign on the uncertain authority of a much later saint's life.

5|$|Although Mariano Moreno was a criollo, a Spanish citizen {{born in the}} Americas, he did {{not work}} with the other criollos of Buenos Aires who sought to promote {{political}} changes against the privileges of the Spanish-born. Unlike the criollo politicians Manuel Belgrano and Juan José Castelli, he did not support viceroy Liniers or the Carlotist project, which sought the coronation of Carlota of Spain in the Americas. He joined mayor Martín de Álzaga instead, which allowed him to serve as legal adviser of the Cabildo. In that capacity, he wrote a petition to the King of Spain, so that the Buenos Aires Cabildo was named Protector of the Cabildos of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. As a result, all petitions from local cabildos to the <b>King</b> <b>or</b> the Viceroy would be channeled through the Cabildo at the capital.|$|E

5|$|Both {{the commons}} and King Richard II were {{enthusiastic}} about the launch of a crusade to Flanders, {{for political and economic}} reasons: revenues from the English wool staple (that had ceased following the advance of the French) could be resumed; sending the bishop and not the <b>king</b> <b>or</b> his uncles to Flanders would enable John of Gaunt's unpopular plans for a royal crusade to Castille to be abandoned; French forces would be drawn away from the Iberian peninsula; and Anglo-Flemish relations would be strengthened. Another advantage in approving a crusade was that its cost would be borne by the Church and not by means of government levies: ever since the Peasants' Revolt, the government was fearful of the consequences of imposing a tax to pay for a new war against the French.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{accounts}} of the Irish annals, English and Scandinavian writers appear to see Mac Bethad as the rightful king of Moray: this is clear from their descriptions of the meeting with Cnut in 1027, before the death of Malcolm mac Máil Brigti. Malcolm was followed as <b>king</b> <b>or</b> earl by his brother Gillecomgan, husband of Gruoch, a granddaughter of King Kenneth III. It has been supposed that Mac Bethad {{was responsible for the}} killing of Gille Coemgáin in 1032, but if Mac Bethad had a cause for feud in the killing of his father in 1020, Malcolm too had reason to see Gille Coemgáin dead. Not only had Gillecomgan's ancestors killed many of Malcolm's kin, but Gillecomgan and his son Lulach might be rivals for the throne. Malcolm had no living sons, and the threat to his plans for the succession was obvious. As a result, the following year Gruoch's brother or nephew, who might have eventually become king, was killed by Malcolm.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to coronations, the Imperial State Crown is usually worn at State Openings of Parliament, where the Sword of State and two maces are carried in procession. Fonts are used at royal christenings, and altar plate {{is used for}} weddings, Royal Maundy, {{and a few other}} occasions. Many pieces have fallen out of use altogether, like the trumpets and banqueting plate, and some were only designed to be used once. When not in use the Jewels are on public display, mainly in the Jewel House, a vault at the Tower of London where they are seen by around 2.5million visitors from across the world every year. Although {{they are part of the}} Royal Collection and owned by the <b>king</b> <b>or</b> queen for the duration of his or her reign, the Crown Jewels do not belong to the monarch personally.|$|E
