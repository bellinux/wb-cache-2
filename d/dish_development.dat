40|$|The {{proceedings}} of the Fifth Parabolic Dish Solar Thermal Power Program Annual Review are presented. The results of activities within the Parabolic Dish Technology and Module/Systems Development element of the Department of Energy's Solar Thermal Energy Systems Program were emphasized. Among the topics discussed were: overall Project and Program aspects, Stirling and Brayton module development, concentrator and engine/receiver development along with associated hardware and test results; distributed systems operating experience; international parabolic <b>dish</b> <b>development</b> activities; and non-DOE-sponsored domestic dish activities. Solar electric generation was also addressed...|$|E
40|$|The {{parabolic}} <b>dish</b> <b>development</b> activities being undertaken {{within the}} private sector of the United States were addressed. The primary emphasis of these non-DOE-sponsored activities {{is the development of}} commercial products that can penetrate the market in the near term. The exchange of information between these activities and the complementary DOE-sponsored work directed toward developing advancements in technology is considered to be of major importance. The experiences and problems encountered in {{the private sector}} serve as inputs that will help guide in the planning of the DOE program. In turn, a principal objective of the DOE program is the transfer findings of its technological development activities to the private sector. Activities in the private are characterized by their diversity in terms of both product design and marketing approach. The differences in the design concepts and the sizes of the dish concentrators under development are particularly noteworthy...|$|E
40|$|Objective Diffuse {{idiopathic}} skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) {{is characterized}} by ossification of different entheseal sites. Several metabolic factors have been suggested {{to be involved in}} <b>DISH</b> <b>development.</b> We assessed the prevalence of DISH and its relationship to traditional vascular risk factors in a cohort of patients diagnosed with cardiovascular diseases. Methods Among the 521 consecutive patients admitted to the heart diseases rehabilitation program in our Rehabilitative Cardiology Unit, only those (n = 436) with recent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), a heart valve replacement (HVR), or congestive heart failure (CHF) were enrolled (45 CHF, 338 CABG, and 53 HVR). All patients underwent a rheumatologic examination, blood sample collections, and chest radiographs. Body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and information about sex, age, smoking habit, and other vascular risk factors were recorded. DISH was established according to the Resnick and Niwayama criteria. Results In the setting (77. 1 % men), the mean ± SD age was 65. 44 ± 9. 66 years and the overall prevalence of DISH was 30. 3 %. A logistic regression analysis showed that both age (odds ratio [OR] 1. 076, 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI] 1. 044 - 1. 109; P < 0. 001) and obesity (OR 2. 28, 95 % CI 1. 33 - 3. 89; P = 0. 003) were significant predictors of the presence of DISH. An increasing OR for the presence of DISH was found for increasing tertiles of age and BMI. No difference resulted according to other traditional vascular risk factors. BMI and age directly correlated with C-reactive protein levels. Conclusion The overall prevalence of DISH was 30. 3 %. This is expected because of the study population. Obese and older individuals exhibit a higher risk of DISH developmen...|$|E
50|$|As {{with many}} dishes, the {{invention}} of ginger beef is claimed by several restaurants and chefs. However, the most widely accepted origin attributes the <b>dish's</b> <b>development</b> during the mid-1970s by chef George Wong at the Silver Inn in Calgary, Alberta. The dish is now {{a very important part}} of culture in Calgary and that part of Canada. A radio segment featuring ginger beef was aired on CBC Radio One programme The Main Ingredient.|$|R
50|$|Besides the snacks, Hubei cuisine {{ranks as}} one of China’s ten major styles of cooking with many {{representative}} <b>dishes.</b> With <b>development</b> of more than 2,000 years, Hubei cuisine, originating in Chu Cuisine in ancient times, has developed a lot of distinctive dishes with its own characteristics, such as steamed blunt-snout bream in clear soup, preserved ham with flowering Chinese cabbage, etc.|$|R
50|$|In 1981, Hubbard Broadcasting started U.S. Satellite Broadcasting (USSB), {{and later}} was {{instrumental}} in the development and launching of the first digital satellite system for television in 1994. The new satellite could deliver 175 channels to a (at the time) tiny, 18 inch <b>dish.</b> USSB's <b>development</b> partner, Hughes Electronics (a General Motors subsidiary), launched their own subscription satellite service called DirecTV. The two services did not compete against each other (they carried different channels), and were often marketed together to subscribers by retailers and in advertisements until DirecTV's 1998 acquisition of USSB.|$|R
40|$|Appropriate {{selection}} of a single blastocyst for transfer decreases the risk of multiple gestations. By using a compact time-lapse microscope system placed inside a regular incubator, combined with a microwell embryo culture <b>dish,</b> the <b>development</b> of all the embryos from a patient was continuously monitored by obtaining images at 10 min intervals. The embryos were not moved during the time-lapse observation. The system was switched off completely between image acquisitions {{in order to avoid}} exposure to electromagnetic radiation. The analysis of time-lapse records was used to choose a single blastocyst for transfer, which resulted in a singleton pregnancy and birth of a healthy boy on term...|$|R
5000|$|In 2002, {{the company}} was renamed Impossible Pictures and began its long {{relationship}} with DISH Network. Impossible's first project for <b>DISH</b> was <b>development</b> of the [...] "DISH Character," [...] which subsequently led {{to the production of}} multiple 3D animated spots and campaigns. In 2004, Impossible won its first Emmy for the 3D animated [...] "Nutcracker" [...] spot created for the Colorado Ballet. The company earned its first Gold BDA Award in 2005, for its work developing the on-air brand launch of Altitude Sports and Entertainment. This helped launch Impossible's move into network television promotion, as the company took on broadcast promo work for Science Channel, Discovery Channel, Travel Channel, National Geographic Channel and others.|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2003 American Chemical SocietyThe vapors of citral, its isomers geranial and neral, and its related {{compounds}} were examined for {{their effect on}} Penicillium digitatum, Penicillium italicum, and Geotrichum candidum, the major fungi responsible for postharvest spoilage of citrus. Vapor of citral and its two isomers generated from 15 μL L⁻¹ aqueous solutions in Petri <b>dishes</b> inhibited <b>development</b> of the three pathogens, with concentrations of 2 - 6 μL L⁻¹ also being effective against P. italicum. Vapors of citral and geranial from 15 μL L⁻¹ solutions were fungicidal to P. digitatum and G. candidum, while neral was fungicidal to G. candidum. Citral-{{related compounds}} were much less effective, with effectiveness decreasing from citronellal to citronellol and citronellic acid.

40|$|Coccinella sp. is an {{important}} biological agent as a predator of soybean aphids (Aphis glycines Mat). The research was conducted in the laboratory of Pests Identification and Biological Control, Departement of Pest and Plant Diseases, Faculty of Agriculture, Hasanuddin University. It was {{the aim of the}} study to determine the feeding capability of Coccinella sp. on artificial diets. The results showed that the amount of diet available and the stadium of predator significantly affected the feeding capacity of the predator. The feeding capability of the adult and 3 th instar larvae of the predator Coccinella sp. was higher when given 15 mg than 10 mg; while adult females tended to eat more than the adult males and larvae did. Adult females lived longer than adult males, both when they were placed in separate Petri dish and in the same Petri <b>dish.</b> The <b>development</b> times from larval instar III to pupa and from pupa to adult were 3 - 4 days and 3 days, respectivel...|$|R
30|$|Ten (10 [*]±[*] 2) fertilized oocytes were {{randomly}} sampled into Petri <b>dish</b> and their <b>developments</b> were studied under the microscope. The development stages were also verified with the ongoing {{stages in the}} incubation tanks. Oocyte, embryonic and larval developmental stages were studied right from unfertilized matured oocyte, to fertilization and hatching {{with the aid of}} biological computer-aided light microscope (Olympus Trinocular Microscope XSZ- 156  T) mounted with digital camera (DCM 130, Res 1.3  M pixels). With this microscope, developing oocytes, hatching, alevin and larval stages were viewed, monitored and photographed and their times of occurrence were documented.|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} {{examine the effect of}} supplemental glucose (G; 1. 5 mM) and/or acetate (A; 0. 5 mM) on the development of early sheep embryos to blastocysts when cultured in vitro in glucose-free synthetic oviductal fluid (SOF) + sheep serum or bovine serum albumin (BSA). In Experiment 1, 2 - to 4 -cell, 8 - to 16 -cell and > 16 -cell embryos were cultured in SOF, SOF+G, SOF+A or SOF+G+A. All media were supplemented with 10 % sheep serum. In addition, embryos were cultured in either microdrops under polysiloxane oil or in multiwell <b>dishes.</b> Overall, <b>development</b> to the blastocyst stage was 3 %, 30 % and 68 % for 2 - to 4 -cell, 8 - to 16 -cell and > 16 -cell stages, respectively, suggesting that an 8 -cell developmental block existed under our culture conditions. Glucose supplementation had little effect on embryo development, and no overall effect was observed from the addition of acetate. In Experiment 2, 8 - to 16 -cell embryos were cultured in SOF or SOF+G, both supplemented with BSA. Development to the blastocyst stage was 25 % and 18 %, respectively. The results show that the presence of glucose or acetate did little to enhance embryonic development in our incubation systems. Further work is required to evaluate fully the energy requirements for development of the early sheep embryo...|$|R

40|$|The {{design and}} {{development}} of a 7 meter diameter parabolic dish solar collector are discussed. Each of the four main subsystems of the collector: (1) reflector, (2) mount and drives, (3) receiver and (4) the controls, is discussed briefly with the major emphasis on the receiver design. To minimize development risks and production costs, a dish design based on use of stamped aluminum petals (sectors) was chosen. This design {{is similar to the}} design of a communication antenna already commercially produced. The reflective surface of the petals has a total reflectance of. 86 and a specularity (dispersion) of 8 mrd. This performance is obtained by mechanical polishing and chemical brightening of the petal surface, followed by application of a clear RTV silicone protective coating. Selection of the material and weather proofing coated are discussed. Results from performance tests on an engineering <b>development</b> <b>dish</b> collector are presented and compared with pretest predictions...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to clarify the {{efficacy}} of the well of the well (WOW) culture system for a small number of embryos and the effect of number of adjacent embryos in a WOW <b>dish</b> on blastocyst <b>development.</b> In conventional droplet culture, embryos in the small-number group (5 - 6 embryos/droplet) showed low blastocyst development compared with a control group (25 - 26 embryos/droplet). However, small and large numbers of embryos (5 - 6 and 25 embryos, respectively) in a WOW dish showed no significant differences in cleavage, blastocyst rates, and mean cell number in blastocysts compared with the control group (25 - 30 embryos/droplet). In addition, the number of adjacent embryos in a WOW dish did not affect the development to blastocysts and cell number in blastocysts. In conclusion, a WOW dish can provide high and stable blastocyst development in small group culture wherever embryos are placed in microwells of the WOW dish...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, we {{can find}} several {{diseases}} related to the unhealthy diet habits of the population, such as diabetes, obesity, anemia, bulimia and anorexia. In many cases, these diseases {{are related to the}} food consumption of people. Mediterranean diet is scientifically known as a healthy diet that helps to prevent many metabolic diseases. In particular, our work focuses on the recognition of Mediterranean food and <b>dishes.</b> The <b>development</b> of this methodology would allow to analise the daily habits of users with wearable cameras, within the topic of lifelogging. By using automatic mechanisms we could build an objective tool for the analysis of the patient's behaviour, allowing specialists to discover unhealthy food patterns and understand the user's lifestyle. With the aim to automatically recognize a complete diet, we introduce a challenging multi-labeled dataset related to Mediterranean diet called FoodCAT. The first type of label provided consists of 115 food classes with an average of 400 images per dish, and the second one consists of 12 food categories with an average of 3800 pictures per class. This dataset will serve as a basis for the development of automatic diet recognition. In this context, deep learning and more specifically, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), currently are state-of-the-art methods for automatic food recognition. In our work, we compare several architectures for image classification, with the purpose of diet recognition. Applying the best model for recognising food categories, we achieve a top- 1 accuracy of 72. 29 %, and top- 5 of 97. 07 %. In a complete diet recognition of dishes from Mediterranean diet, enlarged with the Food- 101 dataset for international dishes recognition, we achieve a top- 1 accuracy of 68. 07 %, and top- 5 of 89. 53 %, for a total of 115 + 101 food classes.

40|$|The {{widespread}} use {{and consumption of}} crude oil draws the public’s attention {{to the fate of}} petroleum hydrocarbons in the environment, as they can permeate the soil environment in an uncontrollable manner. Contamination of soils with petroleum products, including diesel oil (DO), can cause changes in the microbiological soil properties. The effect of diesel oil on the functional diversity of fungi was tested in a model experiment during 270 days. Fungi were isolated from soil and identified. The functional diversity of fungal communities was also determined. Fungi were identified with the MALDI-TOF method, while the functional diversity was determined using FF-plates made by Biolog®, with 95 carbon sources. Moreover, the diesel oil degradation dynamics was assessed. The research showed that soil contaminated with diesel oil is characterized by a higher activity of oxireductases and a higher number of fungi than soil not exposed to the pressure of this product. The DO pollution has an adverse effect on the diversity of fungal community. This is proved by significantly lower values of the Average Well-Color Development, substrates Richness (R) and Shannon–Weaver (H) indices at day 270 after contamination. The consequences of DO affecting soil not submitted to remediation are persistent. After 270 days, only 64 % of four-ringed, 28 % of five-ringed, 21 % of 2 – 3 -ringed and 16 % of six-ringed PAHs underwent degradation. The lasting effect of DO on communities of fungi led to a decrease in their functional diversity. The assessment of the response of fungi to DO pollution {{made on the basis of}} the development of colonies on Petri <b>dishes</b> [Colony <b>Development</b> (CD) and Eco-physiological Diversity (EP) indices] is consistent with the analysis based on the FF MicroPlate system by Biolog®. Thus, a combination of the FF MicroPlate system by Biolog® with the simultaneous calculation of CD and EP indices alongside the concurrent determination of the content of PAHs and activity of oxireductases provides an opportunity to achieve relatively complete characterization of the consequences of a long-term impact of diesel oil on soil fungi...|$|R
40|$|The {{ecological}} {{interactions between}} the endemic magpie moth (Nyctemera annulata) and four weedy Senecio spp. (two indigenous spp., S. glomeratus and S. quadridentatus and two adventive spp., S. sylvaticus and S. vulgaris), were examined in relation to insect preference and development, and counterdefences or developmental responses of the:hosts. Larval development, adult fecundity and host preference {{as a result of}} larval food plant conditioning were studied. Potential depredation of the insect on the hosts was determined and their physical defences and responses to defoliation were assessed. Imago ovipositing was not species specific but directly correlated with dry weight and leaf number of host Senecio spp. Under laboratory conditions fifth instar larvae selected the plant species supporting the most successful larval development, independent of larval conditioning. Food plant preference was in the order: Senecio vulgaris> S. glomeratus = S. quadridentatus > S. sylvaticus. Larvae selected S. vulgaris in field conditions before anthesis but this preference decreased at anthesis. Larvae reared on S. vulgaris had the highest pIc efficiency and E. C. I. value, resulting in rapid larval and pupal development, with larger and heavier instars when compared with other Senecio spp. Larvae reared on S. vulgaris always selected this species in petri <b>dishes.</b> However larval <b>development</b> on different specific hosts did not alter the correlation of oviposition with dry weight and leaf number. The order of imago fecundity for larvae raised on three Senecio spp. was: S. glomeratus > S. vulgaris > S. quadridentatus. Fifth instar larvae acquired the major proportion of the larval food and defoliated the four species to ground level under glasshouse conditions. However the expected overcrowding and complete defoliation in nature has not been observed, possibly due to populations being checked by a high juvenile larval mortality. All Senecio spp. were cold-tolerant and established during winter when larvae showed minimal activity. S. glomeratus and S. quadridentatus~ the two indigenous species, responded to defoliation by vegetative regeneration from root stock. S. vulgaris responded by producing mature fruit more rapidly when attacked. N. annulata may influence the altitudinal distribution of S. sylvaticus as this species is more prolific at higher altitudes where the insect is probably univoltine...|$|R
