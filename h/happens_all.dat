The game maintains {{the look and feel of}} Mario 64, but instead of flat, shaded polygons, [...] uses a lot of textures". The game's long draw distance, solid frame rate, special lighting, transparency effects, and animations were also highlighted very positively. Critics also praised the game's dynamic soundtrack. Schneider remarked that it [...] "lets players know where they are going. This <b>happens</b> <b>all</b> the time and in every level. It's all very Disney-esque." [...] The sound effects received similar praise, with several editors crediting the unique and diverse speech patterns of the characters.|$|E

Ellen Bury's throat was not cut, and only relatively shallow cuts were made to her abdomen. The identity of the Whitechapel murderer is unknown, and over one hundred suspects, in addition to Bury, have been proposed. While some Ripper writers consider Bury a more likely culprit {{than many of the}} other suspects, other writers dismiss the theory because, [...] "as <b>happens</b> <b>all</b> too frequently in this field, the theorizing appears to have a few disturbing leaps of logic as well as mere anecdotes used as evidence." ...|$|E

I thought, 'How wonderful of EastEnders to write a character that is realistic.' What my character has done <b>happens</b> <b>all</b> the time in India; {{there are all kinds of}} stories of people running away and marrying their lovers.

500|$|The {{community}} of Stockton opposed filming in the area, as memories of Leigh's murder were still fresh {{and the details}} of the script were [...] "too close for comfort". When filmmakers arrived in Stockton in late August 1996, locations that had previously been reserved were suddenly no longer available. The local media treated them with hostility. Former Newcastle deputy mayor and Stockton resident Frank Rigby criticised the film during production, saying [...] "I would just love it to go away and so would everybody else." [...] Brian Joyce was also critical of the decision to film in the area, saying the filmmakers had to acknowledge the choice they had made in doing so. The situation was exacerbated by the filmmakers' denial that the film was specifically about Leigh, despite their choice of Stockton for filming. During production [...] in September 1996, Elfick told The Newcastle Herald that he was [...] "getting a bit bored" [...] of people mentioning Leigh's murder. While acknowledging that the comments were understandable, Elfick concluded, [...] "Unfortunately, that event <b>happens</b> <b>all</b> over Australia. We wanted to take the events of that murder and many other murders". He was also quoted in The Sydney Morning Herald as saying, [...] "The movie is bigger than the Leigh Leigh thing". Elfick hoped that people viewing the film would see it as a positive {{way of looking at the}} circumstances that led to Leigh's death, and that it would make people think and maybe stop something like that happening to someone in the future. Leigh's family were vehemently opposed to the film, saying that the filmmakers were [...] "feasting on an unfortunate situation", insensitively trivialising and exploiting her death, and portraying her negatively while doing so. One of Leigh's aunts wrote to The Newcastle Herald later that month, saying [...] "David Elfick doesn't seem to mind [...] free publicity even if it comes from the tragic and brutal assault, rape, and murder of a fourteen-year-old virgin, not as he called it: 'the Leigh Leigh thing which <b>happens</b> <b>all</b> over Australia.'" [...] Enright said that while Leigh's murder served as the inspiration, the completed film is about the way a small town reacts when one of its own members murders another.|$|E
500|$|The as-imagined {{album and}} the as-released album bear little {{relation}} to each other. The {{final version of}} Imaginos is almost forty minutes shorter than {{the first version of}} 1984 and has two fewer songs, but as Pearlman explained, [...] "we ran out of money and couldn't do the whole thing". The rhythm section of the original recording was kept mostly intact, but many guitars and most of the keyboards and lead vocals were re-recorded or remixed. The song order was scrambled out of the fixed chronology, possibly because of the label executives' intervention to have a more commercially attractive product. The sleeve notes' definition of the album as a [...] "random access myth (where) everything <b>happens</b> <b>all</b> at once", appears to many as a posthumous justification for the mixed-up song order. Imaginos does not contain ballads or an immediately recognizable commercial single, and its music is often considered the heaviest produced by Blue Öyster Cult, the best attempt by the band to produce a heavy metal album. Critics and fans point to elements of progressive rock also present in the music, which create a dark and [...] "ominous" [...] atmosphere that fits the obscure content of the song lyrics.|$|E

On October 20, 2010, TV Guide announced that Back to the Future star Christopher Lloyd had been cast {{in an upcoming}} episode as [...] "Walter's musical hero". Noble explained Lloyd's role: [...] "We all know how much Walter loves music, right? Well this fellow {{was one of his}} icons. He adored this man. So Walter gets to {{be a bit of a}} fanboy". Lloyd began shooting the episode in late October. Soon before the episode aired, Lloyd told reporters [...] "I was very excited for this role. My character is going through an experience he never expected to happen to him, and he's adjusting to that." [...] Lloyd also added he felt welcomed in as a part of the ensemble cast. In a conference call interview with journalists, John Noble explained that [...] "probably the best fun that I've had [...] was doing the stuff with Chris Lloyd, because it was two crazy old guys just trying desperately to communicate with each other. We had a lot of laughs. There was a common thread of trying to find the music again, because Chris' character had forgotten how to play the piano, so we go through this journey of bringing the music back to him, and [...] thrill to Walter.

500|$|The {{title of}} [...] "Compass Point", a song Frankel wrote in 45 minutes, is a {{reference}} to Chris Blackwell's Compass Point Studios, where numerous popular musicians in the style mixture of funk, reggae and synthpop, that Crime Cutz pays a tribute to, recorded their music. Its working title was [...] "Back to Earth", {{and was the first}} song to be written for but was not included on their second studio album Dynamics. As Millhiser explains, [...] "There was always some indescribable thing about it that irked us, so we went back to that song with the intention of being like, 'Oh, you know, it’s just a matter of re-recording the vocals or the piano, and it’ll be done.' That of course was not the case, and we ended basically just keeping the drums and one line from the song, making a totally different song out of it, essentially remixing ourselves." [...] Frankel called the EP's closer, [...] "Footsteps", to be the least rhythmic of all the tracks. Its original title was [...] "Your Favorite Band/Footsteps". As Frankel described coming up with the name, [...] "I was going the other night to see our friends in Hot Chip. When I was there, I overheard some people saying, 'I thought they were playing, but they’re DJing,' and that’s something that <b>happens</b> <b>all</b> the time now. People go to see their favorite band, and it turns out it’s a DJ set. I thought it was kind of funny, and also kind of sad — but in a funny way." [...] While the version of Crime Cutz that was officially released only consists of four tracks, Holy Ghost! said in their January 2016 announcement of the EP that a fifth track might be included; [...] "We’re still messing around, because {{we have a lot of}} demos from this last year and a half, and we’re sifting through, figuring out if there’s one more we want to finish." ...|$|E

A similar theory was expounded by Brooks Brown in his book on the massacre; he noted that teachers commonly looked the other way when confronted with bullying, and that whenever Klebold and Harris were the recipients of such incidents from the jocks at Columbine, they would make statements such as: [...] "Don't worry, man. It <b>happens</b> <b>all</b> the time!" [...] if anyone expressed shock or surprise.|$|E

Winter contrasted any possible punishment of Henry with the two-month ban issued to Diego Maradona for simply 'insulting reporters'. Diana Worman on Aljazeera.net criticised FIFA's decision to investigate Henry for an act that <b>happens</b> <b>all</b> the time, and would have only warranted a yellow card, writing [...] "Henry should never have been expected to make a 'sportsmanlike' decision after the goal and it's unfair for Fifa to make an example of him". The Canadian Press criticised FIFA's [...] "cowardly" [...] decision to investigate Henry and do nothing to change the situation for the 2010 World Cup.
