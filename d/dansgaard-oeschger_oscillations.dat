40|$|<b>Dansgaard–Oeschger</b> <b>oscillations</b> {{constitute}} one of {{the most}} enigmatic features of the last glacial cycle.

Here, based on dinocyst analyses from the 48 – 30  ka interval of four sediment cores from the northern Northeast Atlantic and southern Norwegian Sea, we provide direct and quantitative evidence of a regional paradoxical seesaw pattern: cold Greenland and North Atlantic phases coincide with warmer sea-surface conditions and shorter seasonal sea-ice cover durations in the Norwegian Sea as compared to warm phases. Combined with additional palaeorecords and multi-model hosing simulations, our results suggest that during cold Greenland phases, reduced Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and cold North Atlantic sea-surface conditions were accompanied by the subsurface propagation of warm Atlantic waters that re-emerged in the Nordic Seas and provided moisture towards Greenland summit...|$|E

Given {{the strength of this}} teleconnection, we seek to reconstruct its range of environmental impacts. We present geochemical and sedimentological data from core SO 130 - 289 KL from the Indus submarine slope spanning the last ~ 80 kyr. Elemental and grain size analyses consistently indicate that interstadials are characterized by an increased contribution of fluvial suspension from the Indus River. In contrast, stadials are characterized by an increased contribution of aeolian dust from the Arabian Peninsula. Decadal-scale shifts at climate transitions, such as onsets of interstadials, were coeval with changes in productivity-related proxies. Heinrich events stand out as especially dry and dusty events, indicating a dramatically weakened Indian summer monsoon, potentially increased winter monsoon circulation, and increased aridity on the Arabian Peninsula. This finding is consistent with other paleoclimate evidence for continental aridity in the northern tropics during these events. Our results strengthen the evidence that circum-North Atlantic temperature variations translate to hydrological shifts in the tropics, with major impacts on regional environmental conditions such as rainfall, river discharge, aeolian dust transport, an...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} planktonic organisms during abrupt climatic {{variations}} of the last glacial period (<b>Dansgaard-Oeschger</b> <b>oscillations,</b> D-O) may reveal important insights on climatic, oceanographic and biological interactions. Here we present planktic foraminifera and coccolithophore data collected at the Ocean Drilling Program Site 963 (Sicily Channel), with a mean sampling resolution of respectively 43. 5 and 98. 9. yr, over the interval between 70, 000 and 20, 000. yr ago. The paleoenvironmental reconstruction suggests that three different scenarios can be seen across each D-O cycle: 1. oligotrophic surface water and a deep thermocline for the early Interstadials; 2. a Deep Chlorophyll Maximum and coccolithophore winter/spring blooming in the late Interstadials; 3. reduced productivity together with the shallowing of the nutricline depth during Stadials and Heinrich events. The unique mode of productivity dynamics is corroborated by comparing our paleoecological results with those published from high-resolution cores in the Alboran Sea clearly indicating reduced trophic levels during Stadials and Heinrich events. Finally, we argue that the density contrast between the Atlantic water inflow and subsurface water may have affected productivity dynamics in such a large area.

Here we use high-resolution records of sediment colour [...] a measure of terrigenous versus biogenic content [...] from the Cariaco Basin off the coast of Venezuela and the Arabian Sea to assess teleconnections with the North Atlantic climate system during the last glacial period. The Cariaco record indicates that the intertropical convergence zone migrated seasonally over the site during mild stadial conditions, but was permanently displaced south of the basin during peak stadials and Heinrich events. In the Arabian Sea, we find evidence of a weak Indian summer monsoon during the stadial events. The tropical records show a more variable response to North Atlantic cooling than the Greenland temperature records.

After removal of the abrupt shifts the residual, dejumped dust record is found to match Antarctic climate variability with a temporal lag of several hundred years. It is argued that such variability may reflect changes in the source region of Greenland dust (thought to be the deserts of eastern Asia). Other records from this region and more globally also reveal Antarctic-style variability and suggest that this signal is globally pervasive.

Based on changes in foraminiferal assemblages, grain-size content and previously published TOC and d 13 C records, we reconstruct variations in sea-surface biological productivity, intermediate-water oxygenation and sea-ice conditions during the last 180 kyr. Our data demonstrate remarkable differences between the penultimate (MIS 6) and last (MIS 4 - 2) glacial. Relatively high sea surface bioproductivity and reduced sea-ice cover are reconstructed for the penultimate glacial interval, whereas low bioproductivity and expanded sea-ice cover appear to be typical for the last glacial. Millennial-scale changes in intermediate water ventilation are inferred from faunal records for the middle part of the penultimate glacial. High-amplitude environmental variability during the penultimate glacial time in the Bering Sea resembles the well-known <b>Dansgaard-Oeschger</b> <b>oscillations,</b> and roughly corresponds to similar rapid climatic fluctuations found in North Atlantic records. The Termination II and I intervals display a similar succession of high-bioproductivity events, being more pronounced during the penultimate glacial-interglacial transition, {{probably due to the}} different orbital configuration. During the late phase of Termination II, two short intervals, characterized by high sea surface bioproductivity and low oxygen content of bottom waters, resemble the Bølling and Allerød warmings, whereas an episode with low bioproductivity occurs in between, similar to the Older Dryas.

They are ideal materials for precise U-series dating, yielding ages in calendar years, thereby circumventing the radiocarbon calibration problems associated with most other continental records. Stable isotope studies in speleothems have shifted away from attempting to provide palaeo-temperature reconstructions to the attainable goal of providing precise estimates for the timing and duration of major O isotope-defined climatic events characterised by high signal to noise ratios (e. g. glacial/interglacial transitions, <b>Dansgaard–Oeschger</b> <b>oscillations,</b> the ‘ 8200 year’ event). Unlike the marine records, speleothem data sets are not ‘tuned’, and their independent chronology offers opportunities to critically assess leads and lags in the climate system, that in turn can provide important insights into forcing and feedback mechanisms. Improved procedures for the extraction and measurement of stable isotope ratios in fluid inclusions trapped in speleothems are likely to provide, in the near future, a much enhanced basis for the quantitative interpretation of O isotope ratios in speleothem calcite. The latter developments open up once again the tantalising prospect of palaeo-temperature estimates, but more importantly perhaps, provide a direct test {{for a new generation}} of general circulation models whose hydrological cycles will incorporate the ‘water isotopes’.

40|$|We combine reconstructions, {{climate model}} {{simulations}} and a conceptual model of glacial climate change on millennial time scales {{to examine the}} relation between the high latitudes of both hemispheres. A lead-lag analysis of synchronised proxy records indicates that temperature changes in Greenland preceded changes of the opposite sign in Antarctica by 400 - 500 yr. A composite record of the Dansgaard-Oeschger events shows that rapid warming (cooling) in Greenland was followed by a slow cooling (warming) phase in Antarctica. The amplitudes, rates of change and time lag of the interhemispheric temperature changes found in the reconstructions are in excellent agreement with climate model simulations in which the formation of North Atlantic Deep Water is perturbed. The simulated time lag between high northern and southern latitudes is mainly determined by the slow meridional propagation of the signal in the Southern Ocean. Our climate model simulations also show that increased deep water formation in the North Atlantic leads to a reduction of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current through diminishing meridional density gradients in the Southern Ocean. We construct a simple conceptual model of interhemispheric <b>Dansgaard-Oeschger</b> <b>oscillations.</b> This model explains major features of the recorded temperature changes in Antarctica as well as the general shape of the north south phase relation found in the observations including a broad peak of positive correlations for a lead of Antarctica over Greenland by 1000 - 2000 yr. The existence of this peak is due to the regularity of the oscillations and does not imply a southern hemisphere trigger mechanism, contrary to previous suggestions. Our findings thus further emphasise the role of the thermohaline circulation in millennial scale climate variability. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Ammonium in Greenland ice cores, a product from North American soil emissions and biomass burning events, can help to fill this gap. Here we use continuous, high-resolution measurements of ammonium concentrations between 110, 000 to 10, 000 years ago from the Greenland NGRIP and GRIP ice cores to reconstruct North American wildfire activity and soil ammonium emissions. We find that on orbital timescales soil emissions increased under warmer climate conditions when vegetation expanded northwards into previously ice-covered areas. For millennial-scale interstadial warm periods during Marine Isotope Stage 3, the fire recurrence rate increased in parallel to the rapid warmings, whereas soil emissions rose more slowly, reflecting slow ice shrinkage and delayed ecosystem changes.

40|$|International audienceThe {{origin and}} {{bifurcation}} structure of abrupt millennial-scale climate transitions under steady external solar forcing {{and in the}} absence of atmospheric synoptic variability is studied by means of a global coupled model of intermediate complexity. We show that the origin of <b>Dansgaard-Oeschger</b> type <b>oscillations</b> in the model is caused by the weaker northward oceanic heat transport in the Atlantic basin. This is in agreement with previous studies realized with much simpler models, based on highly idealized geometries and simplified physics. The existence of abrupt millennial-scale climate transitions during glacial times can therefore be interpreted as a consequence of the weakening of the negative temperature-advection feedback. This is confirmed through a series of numerical experiments designed to explore the sensitivity of the bifurcation structure of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation to increased atmospheric CO 2 levels under glacial boundary conditions. Contrasting with the cold, stadial, phases of millennial oscillations, we also show the emergence of strong interdecadal variability in the North Atlantic sector during warm interstadials. The instability driving these interdecadal-interstadial oscillations is shown to be identical to that found in ocean-only models forced by fixed surface buoyancy fluxes, that is, a large-scale baroclinic instability developing in the vicinity of the western boundary current in the North Atlantic. Comparisons with modern observations further suggest a physical mechanism similar to that driving the 30 - 40 years time scale associated with the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation...|$|R
40|$|Earth's {{climate and}} the {{concentrations}} of the atmospheric greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO 2) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) varied strongly on millennial timescales during past glacial periods. Large and rapid warming events in Greenland and the North Atlantic were followed by more gradual cooling, and are highly correlated with fluctuations of N 2 O as recorded in ice cores. Antarctic temperature variations, on the other hand, were smaller and more gradual, showed warming during the Greenland cold phase and cooling while the North Atlantic was warm, and were highly correlated with fluctuations in CO 2. Abrupt changes in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) have often been invoked to explain the physical characteristics of these <b>Dansgaard–Oeschger</b> climate <b>oscillations,</b> but the mechanisms for the greenhouse-gas variations and their linkage to the AMOC have remained unclear. Here we present simulations with a coupled model of glacial climate and biogeochemical cycles, forced only with changes in the AMOC. The model simultaneously reproduces characteristic features of the Dansgaard–Oeschger temperature, as well as CO 2 and N 2 O fluctuations. Despite {{significant changes in the}} land carbon inventory, CO 2 variations on millennial timescales are dominated by slow changes in the deep ocean inventory of biologically sequestered carbon and are correlated with Antarctic temperature and Southern Ocean stratification. In contrast, N 2 O co-varies more rapidly with Greenland temperatures owing to fast adjustments of the thermocline oxygen budget. These results suggest that ocean circulation changes were the primary mechanism that drove glacial CO 2 and N 2 O fluctuations on millennial timescales...|$|R

The magnetic properties of several cores from the axial channel and shallow flanks record the inundation process by identifying changes in erosion and deposition. In addition to these natural changes, European settlement within the watershed and adjacent coastline increased sedimentation in the bay by exposing surface and subsurface soils to erosion through deforestation and cultivation. ^ A paleo- and environmental magnetic record from Bear Lake (Idaho-Utah) details changes in the hydrological balance of the lake over several glacial and interglacial cycles. Millennial-scale variations in the abundance of Fe-oxides (similar in timing to North Atlantic <b>Dansgaard-Oeschger</b> <b>oscillations)</b> suggest a relationship between the size of the Laurentide ice sheet, the position of the polar jet stream, and glacial advances in the Uinta Mountains. ^ The magnetic record from Gorina Quarry of the Buenos Aires Province of Argentina shows a series pedogenic complexes formed during several periods of soil formation and loess deposition.

Feedback mechanisms between ocean heat transport, atmospheric circulation, and low latitude climate changes are thought {{to play an important role}} in the continuation, amplification, and possibly initiation of D-O climate oscillations. However, the role low-latitude climate zones and their potential to influence or initiate high-latitude climate change is still unknown. The region off Cape Blanc (Northwest Africa) is situated between the North Atlantic mid latitudes and the equatorial Atlantic, and is a key region to study climate forcing in the subtropics. Millennial-scale changes of the terrigenous sediment composition based on non-destructive XRF core scanning and grain-size variations of the terrigenous sediment fraction indicate coherent high- and low- climate variations during the last glacial-interglacial cycle. Water corrected X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) Core Scanner measurements are used to obtaining chemical changes of the eolian dust input. End member modeling of the terrigenous fraction reveal two eolian end members, and a hemipelagic end member. Additionally, opal and organic matter accumulations are used to reconstruct upwelling intensities and surface water productivity off Cape Blanc. These data indicate increased continental aridity, trade wind intensities, and upwelling intensities accompanied by reduced surface water productivity associated with North Atlantic Heinrich events and extreme Greenland stadial events. Moreover, both the eolian contributions off Cape Blanc and simulations of the vegetation (obtained from the Atmosphere-Ocean-Vegetation model CLIMBER 2) indicate that Northwest African humidity is forced by the strength of the African Monsoon during interglacial conditions...|$|R

Ice cores show that Antarctica cooled during the warm phases of the Greenland Dansgaard–Oeschger cycle and vice versa[superscript 2, 3], suggesting an interhemispheric redistribution of heat through a mechanism called the bipolar seesaw[superscript 4 – 6]. Variations in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) strength are thought to have been important, but much uncertainty remains regarding the dynamics and trigger of these abrupt events[superscript 7 – 9]. Key information is contained in the relative phasing of hemispheric climate variations, yet the large, poorly constrained difference between gas age and ice age and the relatively low resolution of methane records from Antarctic ice cores have so far precluded methane-based synchronization at the required sub-centennial precision[superscript 2, 3, 10]. Here we use a recently drilled high-accumulation Antarctic ice core to show that, on average, abrupt Greenland warming leads the corresponding Antarctic cooling onset by 218 ± 92 years (2 σ) for Dansgaard–Oeschger events, including the Bølling event; Greenland cooling leads the corresponding onset of Antarctic warming by 208 ± 96 years. Our results demonstrate a north-to-south directionality of the abrupt climatic signal, which is propagated to the Southern Hemisphere high latitudes by oceanic rather than atmospheric processes. The similar interpolar phasing of warming and cooling transitions suggests that the transfer time of the climatic signal is independent of the AMOC background state.

The research presented here focuses {{on some of the}} first records of hydrologic variability in the central North American continent during an interval of Marine Isotope Stage 3 (24 - 57 thousand years before present (ka)). Sediment core MD 02 - 2551 from the Orca Basin, northern Gulf of Mexico, is used to document the first detailed melting history of the southern margin of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) during MIS 3, and to record terrestrial inputs from the Mississippi River related to changes in evaporation-precipitation over the mid-continent, from 28 - 45 ka. Paired measurements of oxygen isotopes and Mg/Ca-SST on the planktonic foraminifera Globigerinoides ruber (pink) are used to calculate the oxygen isotopic composition of seawater and test one of the key hypotheses for abrupt climate change. Five rvals of freshwater input from 28 - 45 ka do not match the abrupt <b>Dansgaard-Oeschger</b> temperature <b>oscillations</b> recorded in Greenland ice. Rather, summer melting of the LIS may have occurred during Antarctic warming and likely contributed to sea-level variability during MIS 3. A detailed assessment over one of the meltwater events, using the oxygen and carbon isotopic composition of G. ruber and the deeper dwelling Neogloboquadrina dutertrei, demonstrate that meltwater was confined to the surface layers and likely {{had an impact on the}} biological pump in the Gulf of Mexico. A similar oxygen isotopic composition of seawater record determined from the year-round white G. ruber suggests that melting was not limited to the warmest summer months. The timing of LIS meltwater input is decoupled from an interval of enhanced wet conditions over the North American continent and increased Mississippi River discharge, as shown by a suite of organic and sedimentologic proxies. Increasing summer insolation on the orbital scale may have led to a northward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and an intensification and westward shift in the conical position of the Bermuda High, which shuttles moisture to the North American continent and contributes to flooding in the Mississippi River drainage basin...|$|R

Using ice core data we show that the duration of warm (interstadial) periods is strongly correlated with Antarctic climate, and presumably with Southern Ocean (SO) temperature and the position of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) westerlies. We propose a SO control on AMOC stability and interstadial duration via the rate of Antarctic bottom water formation, meridional density/pressure gradients, Agulhas Leakage, and SO adiabatic upwelling. This hypothesis is supported by climate model experiments that demonstrate SO warming leads to a stronger AMOC that is less susceptible to freshwater perturbations. In the AMOC stability diagram, SO warming and strengthening of the SH westerlies both shift the vigorous AMOC branch toward higher freshwater values, thus raising the threshold for AMOC collapse. The proposed mechanism could provide a consistent explanation for several diverse observations, including maximum DO activity during intermediate ice volume/SH temperature, and successively shorter DO durations within each Bond cycle. It may further have implications for the fate of the AMOC under future global warming...|$|R
40|$|A {{synthesis}} {{of old and}} new paleoclimatic data from the Pyramid and Winnemucca lake basins indicates that, between 48. 0 and 11. 5 ∙ 103 calibrated years BP (hereafter ka), the climate of the western Great Basin was, to a degree, linked with the climate of the North Atlantic. Paleomagnetic secular variation (PSV) records from Pyramid Lake core PLC 08 - 1 were tied to the GISP 2 ice-core record via PSV matches to North Atlantic sediment cores whose isotopic and(or) carbonate records could be linked to the GISP 2 δ 18 O record. Relatively dry intervals in the western Great Basin were associated with cold Heinrich events and relatively wet intervals were associated withwarm <b>Dansgaard-Oeschger</b> (DO) <b>oscillations.</b> The association of western Great Basin dry events with North Atlantic cold events (and vice versa) switched sometime after the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) reached its maximum extent. For example, the Lahontan highstand, which culminated at 15. 5 ka, and a period of elevated lake level between 13. 1 and 11. 7 ka were associated with cold North Atlantic conditions, the latter period with the Youngest Dryas event. Relatively dry periods were associated with the Bølling and Allerødwarm events. A large percentage of the LIS mayhave been lost to the North Atlantic during Heinrich events 1 and 2 and may have resulted in the repositioning of the Polar Jet Stream over North America. The Trego Hot Springs,Wono, Carson Sink, and Marble Bluff tephras found in core PLC 08 - 1 have been assigned GISP 2 calendar ages of respectively, 29. 9, 33. 7, 34. 1, and 43. 2 ka. Given its unique trace-element chemistry, the Carson Sink Bed is the same as Wilson Creek Ash 15 in the Mono Lake Basin. This implies that the Mono Lake magnetic excursion occurred at approximately 34 ka and it is not the Laschamp magnetic excursion. The entrance of the First Americans into the northern Great Basin is dated to approximately 14. 4 ka, a time when the climate was relatively dry. Evidence for human occupation of the Great Basin is lacking for the next 1100 years (y); i. e., the oldest western stemmed point site in the Great Basin dates to 13. 3 ka. Two hypotheses are suggested for this cultural hiatus: (1) the climate had deteriorated to the point that people vacated the Great Basin, or (2) people moved to basin-bottom wetlands that persisted during the dry period, and then the subsequent Younger Dryas wet event erased the archaeological evidence deposited around the low-elevation wetland sites...|$|R
