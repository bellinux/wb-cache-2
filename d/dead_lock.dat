40|$|Locking and {{unlocking}} {{operations are}} crucial to keep data consistency for concurrency control. Compared with traditional pessimistic locking method, the neutral concurrency control scheme can highly improve the concurrency of spatial database management systems. However, in consideration of spatial rules, <b>dead</b> <b>locks</b> brought about by waiting mutually for releasing required resources may frequently arise. To avoid such <b>dead</b> <b>locks,</b> referring to the theories of session management in operation system, we set forward an extended locking method for geographical database with spatial rules to implement the collaboration and competition between concurrent locking and unlocking transactions. The method avoids the expenditure of detecting <b>dead</b> <b>locks</b> and rolling back, and the system becomes more efficient. The test shows the extended locking technique makes the spatial database management system more ordered and efficient in a multi-users environment only with some time consumption of managing logical codes...|$|R

No men, however, are more apt at such work than Americans, or more able to exert themselves at their posts. They are not idle.

60|$|Hotel de Louvre, January 6th, 1858.--On Tuesday morning, our dozen {{trunks and}} half-dozen carpet-bags being already packed and labelled, {{we began to}} prepare for our journey {{two or three hours}} before light. Two cabs were at the door by half past six, and at seven we set out for the London Bridge station, while it was still dark and bitterly cold. There were already many people in the streets, growing more {{numerous}} as we drove city-ward; and, in Newgate Street, there was such a number of market-carts, that we almost came to a <b>dead</b> <b>lock</b> with some of them. At the station we found several persons who were apparently going in the same train with us, sitting round the fire of the waiting-room. Since I came to England there has hardly been a morning when I should have less willingly bestirred myself before daylight; so sharp and inclement was the atmosphere. We started at half past eight, having taken through tickets to Paris by way of Folkestone and Boulogne. A foot-warmer (a long, flat tin utensil, full of hot water) was put into the carriage just before we started; but it did not make us more than half comfortable, and the frost soon began to cloud the windows, and shut out the prospect, so that we could only glance at the green fields--immortally green, whatever winter can do against them--and at, here and there, a stream or pool with the ice forming on its borders. It was the first cold weather of a very mild season. The snow began to fall in scattered and almost invisible flakes; and it seemed as if we had stayed our English welcome out, and were to find nothing genial and hospitable there any more.|$|E

Teófilo rushed into the church as the walls and roof tumbled to the ground in a vain attempt to save his lover. When the rubble was cleared the pair was found among the <b>dead,</b> <b>locked</b> in a final embrace. It is said that on moonlit nights one can sometimes make out the face of a young girl, seemingly illuminated by candlelight, high up in the ruins.

50|$|After {{years of}} {{dispute with the}} Lang Park Trust over brewery advertising, Fourex had pouring rights for Lang Park while Powers Brewing was major sponsor of the Broncos. For the 1993 season the Broncos moved to the Council-owned ANZ Stadium, in {{suburban}} Nathan. Signs of a hangover existed with the club losing two of its first three matches, including their debut at the new home ground against the struggling Parramatta Eels. But the Broncos bounced back, beating the Balmain Tigers 50 nil, (the highest winning margin for the club at the time) to establish themselves solidly in the upper echelons of the competition. A last round lapse against St George relegated the Broncos to fifth spot, meaning they had to win four straight elimination games to defend their title. They went on to demolish the Manly Sea Eagles' defence in a 36-10 romp. Canberra dropped dead {{with the loss of}} Ricky Stuart and the Broncos ran roughshod over them with a 30-12 win. Against the Canterbury Bulldogs in the preliminary final, Brisbane were trailing 16-10 at half time, but Allan Langer scored immediately in the second half to level, then potted a field goal to break the <b>dead</b> <b>lock</b> late in the game. In the grand final, again against the Dragons, the Broncos were victorious once more, this time 14-6. This win was significant {{because it was the only}} time a team which had finished 5th in the minor premiership had gone on to win the competition. It was Glenn Lazarus' fifth consecutive grand final appearance, having already played in the previous year's for Brisbane and the three years' before that for Canberra.|$|E
50|$|For the semi-finals, Benfica {{were drawn}} against fellow Primeira Liga side Paços de Ferreira. The semi-finals were contested over two legs {{with the first}} leg taking place at Paços de Ferreira's Estádio da Mata Real.

Benfica broke the <b>dead</b> <b>lock</b> on 58 minutes, after Eduardo Salvio obtained the ball on the right hand side and took on Paços' Vitorino Antunes, where Salvio crossed the ball to an unmarked Lima to tap in Benfica's first goal of the game. Benfica's second came on 75 minutes threw substitute Ola John. The goal arose after Rodrigo's shot was saved by Cássio, and John followed up to tap in Benfica's second to take a two-goal advantage back to Estádio da Luz. Benfica's first leg win had marked five consecutive cup games where Benfica had kept clean sheets. The return leg in Lisbon was played in mid April, over two months after the first leg. The game saw the home side not take many risks, whilst the away side opted for an attacking approach {{in order to reduce the}} two goal deficit. After a quite first half, Benfica broke the deadlock in the second half near the hour mark through Óscar Cardozo to score his sixth overall goal of the competition. Paços would tie the game ten minutes from the end threw Cícero. The game would end tied, and Benfica would win the tie 3-1 on aggregate to progress to the final for the first time since 2005.|$|E
