5|$|One word {{more about}} the bawdy, and I have done. I own the first night this thing was acted, some indecencies had like to have happened, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> fault.

25|$|Since <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> {{intention}} to interrupt my achievement (the OSM), {{but that it}} continue under {{the responsibility of the}} Board of the Symphony and the competent and able technicians that they would recruit, I had no other choice but to remain as director of the orchestra, with the greatest and best desire that the new artistic director that we selected to formally work beside me, José Pablo Moncayo, would arrive to take full responsibility of the situation.|$|E
500|$|In September 2009, {{speculation}} arose {{that group}} member Amelle Berrabah {{had left the}} Sugababes following reports of tension with band member Keisha Buchanan. However, it was announced on 21 September 2009 that Buchanan, the sole original member of the group, had officially left the Sugababes. Buchanan clarified the departure on her official Twitter account, writing: [...] "I'm sad to say that I am no longer {{a part of the}} Sugababes ... Although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> choice to leave, it's time to enter a new chapter in my life ... Sometimes a breakdown in communication and lack of trust can result in many different things." [...] Buchanan was replaced by former Eurovision contestant Jade Ewen. As a result of the line-up change, [...] "Wear My Kiss" [...] was re-recorded for the inclusion of vocals from new member Ewen and the removal of vocals from Buchanan.|$|E

500|$|Danie Pienaar, {{now head}} of South African National Parks Scientific Services, survived the bite of a black mamba without {{antivenom}} in 1998. Although no antivenom was administered, Pienaar was in a serious condition, despite the hospital physicians having declared it a [...] "moderate" [...] black mamba envenomation. At one point, Pienaar lapsed into a coma and his prognosis was declared [...] "poor". Upon arrival at hospital Pienaar was immediately intubated, given supportive drug therapy, put on mechanical ventilation and placed on life support for three days, until the toxins were flushed out of his system. He was released from hospital on the fifth day. Pienaar believes he survived for several reasons. In an article in Kruger Park Times he said [...] "Firstly, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> time to go." [...] The article went on to state, [...] "The fact that he stayed calm and moved slowly definitely helped. The tourniquet was also essential." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I wrote a song a {{while back}} even before [...] "One Sweet Day" [...] and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> {{favorite}} song in the world, but I wrote it. Someone asked me to write a song {{and they told me}} the story, and you know {{it was kind of a}} moving concept or whatever. And I did it, and I was like you know it’s not necessarily what I like per se, but after doing the song over and over again and having people coming up to and saying, thank you for writing ‘Hero’ because it saved my life or it saved my father’s life or my brothers or sisters life, or something of that nature, I said I always have to sing that song when I’m performing because if I don’t, you never know who I’m leaving out and you know what, in times of my life I’ve had to turn to that song lyrically and flip it onto my own life and sing it to myself. So its from the ‘Music Box’ album, and it’s called ‘Hero', this is for you." ...|$|E
500|$|John Tobias {{said that}} his inspirations for the game's story and {{characters}} came from the Chinese mythology {{and some of the}} stories and rumored events about the Shaolin monks. Regarding the film Big Trouble in Little China, Tobias wrote that although this movie [...] "kind of Americanized my obsession for supernatural kung fu films from China, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> biggest influence. My biggest influences came from Tsui Hark films -- Zu Warriors & The Swordsman. We had to get them from bootleggers in Chicago's Chinatown." [...] Tobias' writing and artistic input on the series ended in 1997. Fifteen years later, he said: [...] "I knew exactly what I was going to do with a future story. A few years ago I [...] a sort of sequel to the first MK film and an advancement to the game's mythological roots. The goal was to not runaway from what came before with a retelling, but to move the themes forward. I did it for fun as an exercise in screenwriting, but it felt good to get that out of my system." ...|$|E

500|$|None of {{the columns}} after Dunne joined The American Magazine {{attracted}} the attention the earlier ones had, but Mr. Dooley continued {{to comment on the}} issues of the day. [...] Andrew Carnegie was a repeated target, as was John D. Rockefeller, whom Dooley summed up with [...] "he never done anything wrong, save in the way of business" [...] In 1909, during the debates over the Payne–Aldrich Tariff, Dunne examined the bill and came out of it with an exotic item called [...] "divvy-divvy", which Mr. Dooley allowed, [...] "was let in as a compliment to [...] Senator Aldrich. It's his motto." [...] A seventh Dooley book was published in 1910, but given disappointing sales, the publishers abandoned plans for another in 1911. Although Dunne was a strong supporter of Roosevelt in the contentious 1912 presidential election, Mr. Dooley retained his customary above-the-fray attitude, mocking Roosevelt's excited oratory with Dooley feeling there was a large fire somewhere, a mystery solved when he opens the newspaper and learns [...] "much to my relief, that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> pants but the Republic that was on fire".|$|E
2500|$|Dyer further {{stated that}} his {{intentions}} {{had been to}} strike terror throughout the Punjab and in doing so, reduce the moral stature of the [...] "rebels". He {{said he did not}} stop the shooting when the crowd began to disperse because he thought it was his duty to keep shooting until the crowd dispersed, and that a little shooting would not do any good. In fact he continued the shooting until the ammunition was almost exhausted. He stated that he did not make any effort to tend to the wounded after the shooting: [...] "Certainly not. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> job. Hospitals were open and they could have gone there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Taylor won the toss {{and elected}} to bat on a {{typically}} hard and dry WACA surface. Slater played and missed at Malcolm {{early in his}} innings, but went on {{to make the most}} of being dropped three times by England fielders. Although Taylor and Boon departed in the first session, Slater and Mark Waugh (88) added 183 for the third wicket. Slater's 124, his third of the series, set up a dominant position for the hosts. [...] "I had my luck, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> fault they were dropping the catches" [...] he remarked on the first evening. Steve Waugh was the other main contributor to Australia's total of 402, but was left stranded on 99 not out after a mix up with brother Mark, running for McDermott who was feeling a back strain.|$|E
5000|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> {{intention}} to discuss if the medium were really {{controlled by the}} discarnate entity of Irwin, or whether the utterances emanated from her subconscious mind or those of the sitters.

But <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> {{intention to}} discuss hypotheses, but rather to put on record the detailed account of a remarkably interesting and thought-provoking experiment.|$|R

2500|$|Jackson's {{representative}} {{explained the}} incident, saying, [...] "Justin {{was supposed to}} pull away the rubber bustier to reveal a red lace bra. The garment collapsed and her breast was accidentally revealed." [...] CBS forced Jackson to release a video apology, and said [...] "My decision to change the Super Bowl performance was made after the final rehearsal. MTV, CBS, [...] the NFL {{had no knowledge of}} this whatsoever and unfortunately, the whole thing went wrong in the end. I am really sorry if I offended anyone, that was truly not my intention". Jackson later commented, [...] "Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident" [...] when the statement was replayed in the media. A written statement read, [...] "The decision to have a costume reveal {{at the end of my}} halftime show performance was made after final rehearsals. MTV was completely unaware of it. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> intention that it go as far as it did. I apologize to anyone offended – including the audience, MTV, CBS and the NFL." [...] Due to the event being accidental and unintentional, Jackson refused to release another apology statement to media outlets following this. Speaking to USA Today, Jackson said, [...] "It's truly embarrassing for me to know that 90 million [...] people saw my breast, and then to see it blown up on the Internet the size of a computer screen ... but there are much worse things in the world, and for this to be such a focus, I don't understand." [...] Regarding continued backlash, she responded, [...] "Who knows...Maybe they'll get mad at something that I do in my show, but at least it won't be new to me, since I've already gone through all of this. But I feel very positive that things are going to work out just fine. Everything happens for a reason." ...|$|E
