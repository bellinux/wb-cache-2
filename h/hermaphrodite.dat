5|$|In {{view of this}} interest, Darwin {{prepared}} a paper on Catasetum as an extract from his forthcoming book, which was read to the Linnean Society of London on 3 April 1862. Darwin solved the puzzle by showing that the three flowers were the male, female, and <b>hermaphrodite</b> forms of a single species, but as they differed so much from each other, they had been classified as different genera.|$|E
5|$|Most {{anthozoans}} are unisexual {{but some}} stony corals are <b>hermaphrodite.</b> The germ cells {{originate in the}} endoderm {{and move to the}} gastrodermis where they differentiate. When mature, they are liberated into the coelenteron and thence to the open sea, with fertilisation being external. To make fertilisation more likely, corals emit vast numbers of gametes, and many species synchronise their release in relation to the time of day and the phase of the moon.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{fish species}} are <b>hermaphrodites.</b> Synchronous <b>hermaphrodites</b> possess both ovaries and testes {{at the same}} time. Sequential <b>hermaphrodites</b> have both types of tissue in their gonads, with one type being {{predominant}} while the fish belongs to the corresponding gender.|$|R
50|$|There {{are cases}} where <b>hermaphrodites</b> can {{fertilize}} their own eggs, {{but this is}} usually rare. Most <b>hermaphrodites</b> take {{on the role of}} a male or female to reproduce. Sexual conflict over mating can cause <b>hermaphrodites</b> to either cooperate or display aggressive behavior in the context of gender choice.|$|R
50|$|The fitness {{requirements}} for androdioecy to arise and sustain itself are theoretically so improbable {{that it was}} long considered that such systems do not exist. Particularly, males and <b>hermaphrodites</b> {{have to have the}} same fitness, in other words the same number of offspring, in order to be maintained. However, males only have offspring by fertilizing eggs or ovules of <b>hermaphrodites,</b> while <b>hermaphrodites</b> have offspring both through fertilizing eggs or ovules of other <b>hermaphrodites</b> and their own ovules. This means that all else being equal, males have to fertilize twice as many eggs or ovules as <b>hermaphrodites</b> {{to make up for the}} lack of female reproduction.|$|R
5|$|Queen Christina of Sweden's {{tendency}} to dress {{as a man}} was well known during her time, and excused because of her noble birth. She was brought up as a male and there was speculation {{at the time that}} she was a <b>hermaphrodite.</b> Even after Christina abdicated the throne in 1654 to avoid marriage, she was known to pursue romantic relationships with women.|$|E
5|$|The {{brooding}} anemone (Epiactis prolifera) is gynodioecious, starting life as {{a female}} and later becoming hermaphroditic, so that populations consist of females and hermaphrodites. As a female, the eggs can develop parthenogenetically into female offspring without fertilisation, and as a <b>hermaphrodite,</b> the eggs are routinely self-fertilised. The larvae emerge from the anemone's mouth and tumble down the column, lodging in a fold near the pedal disc. Here they develop and grow, remaining for about three months before crawling off to start independent lives.|$|E
5|$|Depending on the species, {{there are}} two to fifteen large showy flowers, which {{are more or less}} zygomophic and <b>hermaphrodite.</b> Each flower is 1320cm (5"8") across, and the native species are usually purple or red. They are funnelform (funnel shaped) and declinate (curving {{downwards}} and then upwards at the tip) in shape. The perianth has six brightly colored tepals (three outer sepals and three inner petals) that may be similar in appearance or very different. The perianth segments are subequal or unequal. The tepals are united at the base to form a short tube, usually with a rudimentary scaly paraperigonium with fimbriae or a callose ridge present at the throat.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn gynodioecious {{plant species}} with nuclear-cytoplasmic sex determination, females and <b>hermaphrodites</b> plants can coexist {{whenever}} female have higher seed fitness than <b>hermaphrodites.</b> Although {{the effect of}} self fertilization on seed fitness in <b>hermaphrodites</b> has been considered theoretically, this effect is far from intuitive, because it can either increase the relative seed fitness of the females (if it leads <b>hermaphrodites</b> to produce inbred, low quality offspring) or decrease it (if it provides reproductive assurance to <b>hermaphrodites).</b> Hence, empirical investigation is needed to document whether relative seed fitness varies with whether pollen {{is or is not}} limiting to seed production. In the current study, we measured fruit set and seed production in both females and <b>hermaphrodites</b> and the selfing rate in <b>hermaphrodites</b> in two experimental patches that differed in sex ratios in the gynodioecious plant Silene nutans. We found an impact of plant gender, patch, and their interaction, with females suffering from stronger pollen limitation when locally frequent. In the most pollen-limited situation, the selfing rate of <b>hermaphrodites</b> increased and provided <b>hermaphrodites</b> with a type of reproductive assurance that is not available to females. By integrating both the beneficial (reproductive assurance) and costly effects (through inbreeding depression) of self-pollination, we showed that whether females did or did not exhibit higher seed fitness depended on the degree of pollen limitation on seed production...|$|R
40|$|Synopsis Hermaphroditic animals often exhibit mating {{mechanisms}} that seem more damaging {{than those in}} species with separate sexes. Our analyses indicate that this difference is real. While females only remate when the benefit is positive, <b>hermaphrodites</b> remate even when this implies losing female fitness. This occurs because <b>hermaphrodites</b> can outweigh losses in the female function by gaining paternity. In an extended model we ask whether this favors the evolution of more male harm in <b>hermaphrodites.</b> When male harm only suppresses remating in the receiver it neither evolves in <b>hermaphrodites</b> nor in gonochorists. However, when male harm is coupled to a fertilization advantage, it evolves in both forms of gender expression with the highest levels in <b>hermaphrodites.</b> Hence, <b>hermaphrodites</b> {{are more prone to}} be caught in costly escalations than gonochorists. We discuss the implications for the evolution of gender expression in animals and plants...|$|R

5|$|The {{terrestrial}} Argonemertes dendyi is {{a native}} of Australia but has been found in the British Isles, in Sao Miguel in the Azores, in Gran Canaria, and in a lava tube cave at Kaumana on the Island of Hawaii. It can build a cocoon, which allows it to avoid desiccation while being transported, and it may be able to build populations quickly in new areas as it is a protandrous <b>hermaphrodite.</b> Another terrestrial genus, Geonemertes, is mostly found in Australasia but has species in the Seychelles, widely across the Indo-Pacific, in Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic, in Frankfurt, in the Canary Islands, in Madeira and in the Azores.|$|E
5|$|Incest and {{intersex}} {{is another}} theme in Middlesex. Eugenides examines the passionate feelings that siblings living in seclusion experience for each other. Milton and Tessie, second cousins, are conceived {{during the same}} night, hinting to the incest of Desdemona and Lefty. Desdemona and Lefty's incestuous relationship is a transgression of a powerful taboo, indicating that someone will suffer for their wrongs; in a way, Cal's intersex condition symbolizes this Greek hubris. In another incestuous relationship, Milton makes love to Tessie using a clarinet which he lovingly rubs against her; their incestuous relationship enables them to contribute mutated genes to their child Cal. Cal's mother interferes with fate by attempting to make her second child a daughter. Cal believes this interference {{was a factor in}} his being a <b>hermaphrodite.</b> Conversely, Cal's relationship with his brother, ChapterEleven, is indicative of the possible dissimilarities that are products of the biosocial.|$|E
5|$|One {{innovation}} of the Rokeby Venus, {{when compared}} to other large single nude paintings, {{lies in the fact that}} VelÃ¡zquez depicts a back view of its subject who is turned away from the viewer. There were precedents for this in prints by Giulio Campagnola, Agostino Veneziano, Hans Sebald Beham and Theodor de Bry, as well as classical sculptures known to VelÃ¡zquez, of which casts were made for Madrid. These were the Sleeping Ariadne now in the Pitti Palace, but then in Rome, of which VelÃ¡zquez ordered a cast for the Royal collection in 1650â51, and the Borghese Hermaphroditus, a sleeping <b>hermaphrodite</b> (picture to the right above), now in the Louvre, of which a cast was sent to Madrid, and which also emphasises the curve from hip to waist. However, the combination of elements in VelÃ¡zquez's composition was original.|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe optimal {{deployment}} of reproductive resources by <b>hermaphrodites</b> to male versus female function (i. e., their sex allocation) depends directly on opportunities for mating. If <b>hermaphrodites</b> occur among females, selection should favor {{those with a}} male-biased allocation because increased male allocation enhances siring success when eggs are abundant [1 â 3]. Similarly, when <b>hermaphrodites</b> co-occur with males, selection should favor those that bias their allocation toward their female function. We tested these predictions by allowing <b>hermaphrodites</b> of the plant Mercurialis annua to evolve in either {{the presence or absence}} of males. In the presence of males, <b>hermaphrodites</b> did not evolve, probably because they were already strongly female biased in the base population. However, <b>hermaphrodites</b> mating in the absence of males evolved greater male allocation, as predicted. Our results provide the first demonstration of an evolutionary response to the frequency of unisexuals in hermaphroditic sex allocation, and they verify the quantitative phase predicted by models for the transition between hermaphroditism and dioecy [4, 5]...|$|R

40|$|Hermaphroditic {{animals are}} poorly {{represented}} in the sexual selection literature. This deficiency may reflect our inability {{to come to grips}} with hermaphroditism or, alternatively, it could be due to an inherent difference between <b>hermaphrodites</b> and gonochorists. Here we provide a number of reasons why sexual selection on traits related to mate acquisition can be expected to be intrinsically weaker in <b>hermaphrodites.</b> We show that the 'male' fitness component, which can be increased by sexual selection in <b>hermaphrodites,</b> is only half that of pure males in a gonochorist population. This component can be reduced even further when <b>hermaphrodites</b> self-fertilize. As a result, the potential for sexual selection (Ï) on male characters in <b>hermaphrodites</b> is at most half that of gonochorists. Given a specific mate handling cost, sperm production cost and rate of encountering receptive mates, we calculate the optimal allocation to mate acquisition and sperm. Since both partners of a hermaphroditic pair invest in mate acquisition, <b>hermaphrodites</b> should optimally invest less in mate acquisition. This can further reduce Ï by up to one-half. A higher readiness to mate and high investment in sperm can lead to a further systematic reduction in Ps in <b>hermaphrodites...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{nematode}} worm Caenorhabditis elegans, like Drosophila, {{has been}} studied largely because of its importance in genetics. In the early 1970s, Sydney Brenner chose it as a model organism for studying the way that genes control development. One {{of the advantages of}} working with this worm is that the body plan is very stereotyped: the nervous system of the <b>hermaphrodite</b> contains exactly 302 neurons, always in the same places, making identical synaptic connections in every worm. Brenner's team sliced worms into thousands of ultrathin sections and photographed each one under an electron microscope, then visually matched fibers from section to section, to map out every neuron and synapse in the entire body. The complete neuronal wiring diagram of C.elegans â its connectome was achieved. Nothing approaching this level of detail is available for any other organism, and the information gained has enabled a multitude of studies that would otherwise have not been possible.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} {{has a long}} history of {{interaction}} with humanity; depictions of the species exist from the Upper Paleolithic period, with carvings and paintings from the Lascaux and Chauvet Caves. The species has a largely negative reputation in both Western culture and African folklore. In the former, the species is mostly regarded as ugly and cowardly, while in the latter, it is viewed as greedy, gluttonous, stupid, and foolish, yet powerful and potentially dangerous. The majority of Western perceptions on the species can be found in the writings of Aristotle and Pliny the Elder, though in relatively unjudgemental form. Explicit, negative judgements occur in the Physiologus, where the animal is depicted as a <b>hermaphrodite</b> and grave robber. The IUCN's hyena specialist group identifies the spotted hyena's negative reputation as detrimental to the species' continued survival, both in captivity and the wild.|$|E
5|$|Traditional Western {{beliefs about}} the spotted hyena {{can be traced back}} to Aristotle's Historia Animalium, which {{described}} the species as a necrophagous, cowardly and potentially dangerous animal. He further described how the hyena uses retching noises to attract dogs. In On the Generation of Animals, Aristotle criticised the erroneous belief that the spotted hyena is a <b>hermaphrodite</b> (which likely originated from the confusion caused by the masculinised genitalia of the female), though his physical descriptions are more consistent with the striped hyena. Pliny the Elder supported Aristotle's depiction, though he further elaborated that the hyena can imitate human voices. Additionally, he wrote how the hyena was held in high regard among the Magi, and that hyena body parts could cure different diseases, give protection and stimulate sexual desire in people.|$|E
40|$|Sexual {{selection}} is widespread if not ubiquitous in hermaphroditic organisms. Although many phenomena {{that have been}} described as sexual selection in gonochores, (e. g. harem polygamy, multiple mating, elaborate courtship, even secondary sexual characters) can be found in some <b>hermaphrodites,</b> what is more interesting is the ways in which sexual selection in <b>hermaphrodites</b> may differ from dioecious taxa. In <b>hermaphrodites,</b> an individualâs mating success includes its success from both sexual roles. Secondly, in many simultaneously hermaphroditic taxa there is strong evidence of sexual selection and yet the opeÂ­rational sex ratio is 1 : 1, by definition. Many simultaneous <b>hermaphrodites</b> have elaborate courtship and genital anatomy, suggesting sexual selection {{plays an important role in}} reproductive success. Sperm competition and cryptic female choice mean that the number of mates acquired is not necessarily a predictor of reproductive success. Even in simultaneous <b>hermaphrodites</b> with reciprocal mating, variance in reproductive success through the male role and through the female role may differ in a population. Moreover <b>hermaphrodites</b> may choose to emphasize one sexual role over the other. Data suggest that the preferred role varies in <b>hermaphrodites,</b> which creates an opportunity to test fundamental predictions and assumptions of sexual selection theory. <b>Hermaphrodites</b> may vary their emphasis on one sexual role over the other either developmentally or behaviorally in response to environmental or social parameters. How they use this capability in acquiring more or higher quality mates still requires study [Current Zoology 59 (4) : 579 â 588, 2013]...|$|R
50|$|The {{maintenance}} of gynodioecy at first {{may seem like}} a mystery. Theoretically, <b>hermaphrodites</b> should have the evolutionary and reproductive advantage over females in a population because they naturally can produce more offspring. <b>Hermaphrodites</b> can transmit their genes through both pollen and ovules, whereas females can only transmit genes via ovules. Thus, in order for females to remain viable in a population, they would have to be twice as successful as <b>hermaphrodites.</b>|$|R

25|$|Reproductive {{advantages}} of the asexual forms are in quantity of the progeny and the {{advantages of}} the <b>hermaphrodite</b> forms â in maximum diversity. Transition from the <b>hermaphrodite</b> to dioecious state leads to a loss of {{at least half of the}} diversity. So, the main question is to explain the advantages given by sexual differentiation, i.e. the benefits of two separate sexes compared to hermaphrodites rather than to explain benefits of sexual forms (<b>hermaphrodite</b> + dioecious) over asexual ones. It has already been understood that since sexual reproduction is not associated with any clear reproductive advantages, as compared with asexual, there should be some important advantages in evolution.|$|E

40|$|Androdioecy (the {{coexistence}} {{of males and}} <b>hermaphrodites)</b> is considered a transitional state derived from pure hermaphroditism or dioecy, but the processes selecting for this rare breeding system are unclear, particularly in animals. In androdioecious species, the proportion of males in relation to <b>hermaphrodites</b> is usually so reduced {{that it is not}} known whether there is scope for mate choice, particularly when simultaneous <b>hermaphrodites</b> can self-fertilize. We investigated the potential role of male mate choice in the persistence of androdioecy in animals using a self-fertilizing androdioecious fish (Kryptolebias marmoratus) as a model. <b>Hermaphrodites</b> preferred to associate with males but showed no preference based on genetic similarity. In contrast, males displayed a strong preference for genetically dissimilar <b>hermaphrodites,</b> based, apparently, on olfactory cues. We suggest that disassortative male mate choice could be a critical factor in stabilizing androdioecy in cases where high selfing rates are associated with inbreeding depression...|$|R

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2002 Gynodioecy, the {{co-occurrence of}} females and <b>hermaphrodites,</b> is {{considered}} an intermediate step {{in the evolution of}} separate sexes in flowering plants. Highly variable female frequencies among populations suggest structuring of sex determining genes and differences in the relative fitness of females and <b>hermaphrodites</b> as seed parents. I investigated spatial variability in sex ratio and the effects of inbreeding on offspring quality in Silene acaulis. Female frequencies varied among populations from 0. 32 to 0. 69, and most were at temporal equilibrium. Females were significantly clumped within two of six populations. Females produced from 4 to 27 times as many fruits as <b>hermaphrodites.</b> Self-pollination of <b>hermaphrodites</b> reduced offspring survivorship and growth by an average of 67 % compared to outcrosses. Overall, spatial variation in female frequency suggests a role of founder events and local seed dispersal.
