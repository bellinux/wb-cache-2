DeltaG(ads) (0) data also reveal that the adsorption process is mainly determined by adsorption efficiency. Comparatively, the adsorption effectiveness seems to play a less important role.

40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} the regulation mechanisms of the Na+-dependent neutral amino acid transporter ASCT 2 via nitric oxide (NO) {{in the human}} intestinal cell line, Caco- 2. Exposure of Caco- 2 cells to S-nitrosothiol, such as S-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine (SNAP) and S-nitrosoglutathione, and the NO-donor, NOC 12, concentration- and time-dependently increased Na+-dependent alanine uptake. Kinetic analyses indicated that SNAP increases the maximal velocity (Vmax) of Na+-dependent alanine uptake in Caco- 2 cells without affecting the Michaelis–Menten constant (Kt). The stimulatory effect was partially eliminated by actinomycin D and cycloheximide. Increased Na+-dependent alanine uptake by SNAP was partially abolished by the NO scavengers, 2 -(4 -carboxyphenyl) - 4, 4, 5, 5 -tetramethylimidazoline- 1 -oxyl 3 -oxide sodium salt (carboxy-PTIO) and N-(dithiocarboxy) sarcosine <b>disodium</b> <b>salts</b> (DTCS), {{as well as the}} NADPH oxidase inhibitor, diphenyleneiodonium. RT-PCR revealed that Caco- 2 cells expressed the Na+-dependent neutral amino acid transporter ASCT 2, but not the other Na+-dependent neutral amino acid transporters ATB 0,+ and B 0 AT 1. These results suggested that functional up-regulation of ASCT 2 by SNAP might be partially associated with an increase in the density of transporter protein via de novo synthesis...|$|R

The rate of Cu 2 + reduction was proportional to the concentrations of S 0 and Cu 2 + added to the reaction mixture. The pH optimum for the cupric ion-reducing system was 5. 0, and the activity was completely destroyed by 10 -min incubation of cells at 70 °C.
