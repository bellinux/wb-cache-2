5|$|Charles Thom (November 11, 1872 – May 24, 1956) was an American {{microbiologist}} and mycologist. Born {{and raised}} in Illinois, he received his PhD from the University of Missouri, the first such degree awarded by that institution. He was {{best known for his}} work on the microbiology of dairy products and soil fungi, and in particular his research into the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium. His work influenced the establishment of standards for <b>food</b> <b>handling</b> and processing in the USA. He pioneered the use of culture media to grow microorganisms, and, with food chemist James N. Currie, developed a process to mass-produce citric acid using Aspergillus. Thom {{played an important role in}} the development of penicillin in World War II.|$|E

25|$|If {{irradiation}} was {{to become}} common in the <b>food</b> <b>handling</b> process {{there would be a}} reduction of the prevalence of foodborne illness and potentially the eradication of specific pathogens. However, multiple studies suggest that an increased rate of pathogen growth may occur when irradiated food is cross-contaminated with a pathogen, as the competing spoilage organisms are no longer present. This being said, cross contamination itself becomes less prevalent with an increase in usage of irradiated foods.|$|E
25|$|Second, {{significant}} improvements in public health reduce mortality, particularly in childhood. These are not so many medical breakthroughs (Europe passed through stage two before the advances of the mid-20th century, although there was significant medical progress in the 19th century, such as the development of vaccination) as they are improvements in water supply, sewerage, <b>food</b> <b>handling,</b> and general personal hygiene following from growing scientific knowledge {{of the causes of}} disease and the improved education and social status of mothers.|$|E
25|$|In stage two, {{that of a}} {{developing}} country, the death rates drop quickly due to improvements in food supply and sanitation, which increase life expectancies and reduce disease. The improvements specific to food supply typically include selective breeding and crop rotation and farming techniques. Other improvements generally include access to ovens, baking, and television. For example, numerous improvements in public health reduce mortality, especially childhood mortality. Prior to the mid-20th century, these improvements in public health were primarily {{in the areas of}} <b>food</b> <b>handling,</b> water supply, sewage, and personal hygiene. One of the variables often cited is the increase in female literacy combined with public health education programs which emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In Europe, the death rate decline started in the late 18th century in northwestern Europe and spread to the south and east over approximately the next 100 years. Without a corresponding fall in birth rates this produces an imbalance, and the countries in this stage experience a large increase in population.|$|E

5000|$|In {{order to}} prevent serious {{outbreaks}} {{similar to the one}} in 2012 in the future, some precautions must be taken. When <b>handling</b> <b>food,</b> one must be careful not to cross-contaminate raw poultry products or other meats with other <b>foods.</b> Anyone <b>handling</b> <b>food</b> should also be sure to wash their hands frequently. All persons should wash their hands after using the restroom as bacteria can survive {{for long periods of time}} outside of the body and the bacteria will be spread from the unwashed hands to possible food items or anything that may enter the mouth area. When cooking, one should take care to heat foods to at least 167 °F for a minimum of ten minutes to ensure that the entire product is evenly cooked. This is because heat and ultraviolet radiation are good neutralizers of Salmonella bacterium.Recent outbreaks have occurred, and although not all infections can be eliminated, most can be hindered either through coating crops with Salmonella-fighting bacteria [...] or through human precautions.|$|R
