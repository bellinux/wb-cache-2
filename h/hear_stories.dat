25|$|A {{need to tell}} and <b>hear</b> <b>stories</b> is {{essential}} to the species Homo sapiens second in necessity apparently after nourishment and before love and shelter. Millions survive without love or home, almost none in silence; the opposite of silence leads quickly to narrative, and the sound of story is the dominant sound of our lives, from the small accounts of our day's events to the vast incommunicable constructs of psychopaths.|$|E

500|$|In 1931, Kenneth Swezey, a young {{writer who}} had been {{associated}} with Tesla for some time, organized a celebration for the inventor's 75th birthday. Tesla received congratulatory letters from more than 70 pioneers in science and engineering, including Albert Einstein, {{and he was also}} featured on the cover of Time magazine. The cover caption [...] "All the world's his power house" [...] noted his contribution to electrical power generation. The party went so well Tesla made it an annual event, an occasion where he would put out a large spread of food and drink (featuring dishes of his own creation) and invite the press to see his inventions and <b>hear</b> <b>stories</b> about past exploits, views on current events, or sometimes odd or baffling claims.|$|E

40|$|<b>Hearing</b> <b>stories</b> {{can result}} in {{considerable}} incidental vocabulary development, for both first and second language acquisition (e. g. Elley, 1992; Robbins and Ehri, 1994; Senechal, LeFevre, Hudson and Lawon, 1996). It has also been claimed, however, that direct instruction {{is more effective than}} incidental vocabulary acquisition and that combining both approaches will be more effective than incidental acquisition alone (Coady, 1997). In this study, we compare vocabulary growth in English as a foreign language through <b>hearing</b> a <b>story</b> with a combination of a story and supplementary activities designed to focus students specifically on learning the new words in the story. Subjects were first year Japanese female students at a junior college in Osaka. One class was the "story-only " group and the other was the "story-plus-study " group. The story-only group spent only 15 minutes <b>hearing</b> a <b>story.</b> The story-plus- study group spent nearly the entire class hour (85 minutes) <b>hearing</b> the <b>story</b> and doing supplementary activities. Calculations of words learned per minute revealed that the story-only group learned words more efficiently. The results suggest that additional focus on form in the form of traditional vocabulary exercises is not as efficient as hearing words in the context of stories. It has been demonstrated that <b>hearing</b> <b>stories</b> {{can result in}} considerable incidental vocabular...|$|R

500|$|Falle is a {{professor}} at Humber College in Toronto, where she teaches in the police foundations program, educating on the subject of social justice. One of her students, Brittany Swartzentruber, said that Falle's lectures would {{have a significant impact on}} Swartzentruber's career as a police officer, saying, [...] "She was one of the best speakers I have ever heard." [...] Falle partners with the Toronto Police Service's sex crimes unit, which developed the statistic that the average age for a girl to become involved in prostitution in Canada is 14. According to Falle's research, the average age is between 13 and 16. York Regional Police drugs and vice unit Detective Thai Truong said that all law enforcement personnel should <b>hear</b> <b>stories</b> like Falle's because [...] "they remind us that they are not just prostitutes or escorts, but they are somebody's daughter, somebody's sister, somebody's wife." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time, Richard North {{argues that the}} Beowulf poet {{interpreted}} [...] "Danish myths in Christian form" [...] (as the poem would {{have served as a}} form of entertainment for a Christian audience), and states: [...] "As yet we are no closer to finding out why the first audience of Beowulf liked to <b>hear</b> <b>stories</b> about people routinely classified as damned. This question is pressing, given... that Anglo-Saxons saw the Danes as 's' rather than as foreigners." [...] Grendel's mother and Grendel are described as descendants of Cain, a fact which some scholars link to the Cain tradition.|$|E
2500|$|Hogan {{was known}} to {{practice}} {{more than any other}} golfer of his contemporaries and is said to have [...] "invented practice". On this matter, Hogan himself said, [...] "You <b>hear</b> <b>stories</b> about me beating my brains out practicing, but... I was enjoying myself. I couldn't wait {{to get up in the}} morning, so I could hit balls. When I'm hitting the ball where I want, hard and crisply, it's a joy that very few people experience." [...] He was also one of the first players to match particular clubs to yardages, or reference points around the course such as bunkers or trees, in order to improve his distance control.|$|E

2500|$|Their {{relationship}} takes a bad turn {{during the}} Battle of Corrin {{when faced with}} the human-shield situation. Erasmus has placed two million captive humans in an array of cargo containers rigged to explode once the human fleet advances, called the Bridge of Hrethgir. Vorian believes that sacrificing the captive humans is a necessary loss, but Abulurd disagrees. The two argue until Vorian relieves Abulurd of his command and has him confined to quarters. In a final attempt to save the captives, Abulurd deactivates the weapons for the entire fleet, making the Corrin attack more difficult and dangerous and eventually causing much higher casualties. Unknown to either, the robot Erasmus disabled the human shield programming, saving the humans in orbit. [...] Following the victory, Abulurd is discharged and branded a coward by Vorian, though not branded a traitor like his grandfather Xavier, and banished from the League. [...] After Abulurd is sentenced to exile on Lankeveil, his children <b>hear</b> <b>stories</b> about how their nobility had been stolen from them. [...] When Abulurd dies of a fever, his sons claim it was Vorian Atreides who had brought the fever to destroy the Harkonnens. [...] When House Harkonnen returns to the empire, their wild accusations at House Atreides are accepted as truth. Thus begins the feud between House Atreides and House Harkonnen.|$|E

60|$|The {{truth of}} her word {{throughout}} he never doubted; and, indeed, no {{man or woman}} who heard her could have doubted. One <b>hears</b> <b>stories</b> told that to oneself, the hearer, are manifestly false; and one <b>hears</b> <b>stories</b> as to the truth or falsehood of which one is in doubt; and stories again which seem to be partly true and partly untrue. But one also hears that of the truth of which no doubt seems to be possible. So it {{had been with the}} tale which Lady Ongar had told. It had been all as she had said; and had Sir Hugh heard it--even Sir Hugh, who doubted all men and regarded all women as being false beyond a doubt--even he, I think, would have believed it.|$|R

The old man took another stool at my request and we plunged into a sea of revolutionary reminiscences. This old man, albeit clothed like a scarecrow, was like {{any one of the}} six veterans.|$|E

6000|$|The Scotch, by the way, {{resemble}} us in {{liking to}} tell and <b>hear</b> <b>stories.</b> But {{they have their}} own line. They like the stories to be grim, dealing in a jocose way with death and funerals. The story begins (will the reader kindly turn it into Scotch pronunciation for himself), [...] "There was a Sandy MacDonald had died and the wife had the body all laid out for burial and dressed up very fine in his best suit," [...] etc. Now for me that beginning is enough. To me that is not a story, but a tragedy. I am so sorry for Mrs. MacDonald that I can't think of anything else. But I think the explanation is that the Scotch are essentially such a devout people and live so closely within the shadow of death itself that they may without irreverence or pain jest where our lips would falter. Or else, perhaps they don't care a cuss whether Sandy MacDonald died or not. Take it either way.|$|E
60|$|I began now to <b>hear</b> <b>stories</b> of Dowson, whom I {{knew only}} at the Rhymers, or through some chance meeting at Johnson's. I was {{indolent}} and procrastinating, and when I thought of asking him to dine, or taking some other step towards better knowledge, {{he seemed to be}} in Paris, or at Dieppe. He was drinking, but, unlike Johnson, who, at the autopsy after his death, was discovered never to have grown, except in the brain, after his fifteenth year, he was full of sexual desire. Johnson and he were close friends, and Johnson lectured him out of the Fathers upon chastity, and boasted of the great good done him thereby. But the rest of us counted the glasses emptied in their talk. I began to hear now in some detail of the restaurant-keeper's daughter, and of her marriage to the waiter, and of that weekly game of cards with her that filled so great a share of Dowson's emotional life. Sober, he would look at no other woman, it was said, but, drunk, would desire whatever woman chance brought, clean or dirty.|$|E
6000|$|I like to <b>hear</b> <b>stories</b> of the littleness {{of great}} men. I {{like to think}} that Shakespeare was fond of his glass. I even cling to the tale of that disgraceful final orgie with friend Ben Jonson. Possibly the story may not be true, but I hope it was. I like to think of him as poacher, as village ne'er-do-well, denounced by the local grammar-school master, preached at by the local J. P. of the period. I like to reflect that Cromwell had a wart on his nose; the thought makes me more {{contented}} with my own features. I {{like to think that}} he put sweets upon the chairs, to see finely-dressed ladies spoil their frocks; to tell myself that he roared with laughter at the silly jest, like any East End 'Arry with his Bank Holiday squirt of dirty water. I like to read that Carlyle threw bacon at his wife and occasionally made himself highly ridiculous over small annoyances, that would have been smiled at by a man of well-balanced mind. I think of the fifty foolish things a week I do, and say to myself, [...] "I, too, am a literary man." ...|$|E

60|$|She knew its {{sights and}} its hospitality, {{dispensed}} {{with a sort}} of slumbrous dignity in those great houses presenting long, blind walls and heavy portals to the wind-swept pastures. She was given the head of the tables, where masters and dependants sat in a simple and patriarchal state. The ladies of the house would talk softly in the moonlight under the orange trees of the courtyards, impressing upon her the sweetness of their voices and the something mysterious in the quietude of their lives. In the morning the gentlemen, well mounted in braided sombreros and embroidered riding suits, with much silver on the trappings of their horses, would ride forth to escort the departing guests before committing them, with grave good-byes, to the care of God at the boundary pillars of their estates. In all these households she could <b>hear</b> <b>stories</b> of political outrage; friends, relatives, ruined, imprisoned, killed in the battles of senseless civil wars, barbarously executed in ferocious proscriptions, as though the government of the country had been a struggle of lust between bands of absurd devils let loose upon the land with sabres and uniforms and grandiloquent phrases. And on all the lips she found a weary desire for peace, the dread of officialdom with its nightmarish parody of administration without law, without security, and without justice.|$|E

His {{specialty}} got to be yearlings, an' the ranchers all over rose up in arms against him. They hired all the old hunters an' trappers in the country to kill him. No good! Old Lobo went right on pullin' down yearlings. Every night he'd get one or more. An' he was so cute an' so swift that he'd work on different ranches on different nights. Finally he killed eleven yearlings for my boss on one night. Eleven! Think of that. An' then I said to my boss, 'I reckon you'd better let me go kill that gray butcher.' An' my boss laughed at me. But he let me go. He'd have tried anythin'. I took a hunk of meat, a blanket, my gun, an' a pair of snow-shoes, an' I set out on old Lobo's tracks.... An', Miss Columbine, I walked old Lobo to death in the snow!" ...|$|E
