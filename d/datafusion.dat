40|$|Abstract. A multiagent {{architecture}} for {{vehicle and}} structural health monitoring is proposed. A prototype using this architecture was developed using JADE. Critical {{aspects of the}} design were verified using the SPIN model checker. The tasks in our framework are related to <b>datafusion</b> levels and Gibson’s realist position on direct perception of objects and affordances. We show how a system consisting of a multiagent system along with the monitored platform exhibits behavior at several levels, from the physics of acoustic emissions to inter-agent conversations expressing desires and beliefs. Communication, perception of public events, and system design conspire to provide the common knowledge needed to coordinate diagnostic tasks. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—While {{clustering}} genes {{remains one}} of the most popular exploratory tools for expression data, it often results in a highly variable and biologically uninformative clusters. This paper explores a data fusion approach to clustering microarray data. Our method, which combined expression data and Gene Ontology (GO) -derived information, is applied on a real data set to perform genome-wide clustering. A set of novel tools is proposed to validate the clustering results and pick a fair value of infusion coefficient. These tools measure stability, biological relevance, and distance from the expression-only clustering solution. Our results indicate that a <b>datafusion</b> clustering leads to more stable, biologically relevant clusters that are still representative of the experimental data.

40|$|Abstract — Data fusion aims at resolving {{conflicts}} between different sources when integrating their data. Recent fusion techniques {{find the truth}} by iterative MAP (Maximum A Posteriori) analysis that reasons about trustworthiness of sources and copying relationships between them. Providing explanations for such decisions is important, but can be extremely challenging because {{of the complexity of}} the analysis during decision making. This paper proposes two types of explanations for <b>datafusion</b> results: snapshot explanations target casual users, taking the provided data and any other decision inferred from the data as evidence; comprehensive explanations target advanced users, taking only the provided data as evidence. We propose techniques that can efficiently generate correct and compact explanations. Experimental results show that (1) we generate correct explanations, (2) our techniques can significantly reduce the sizes of the explanations, and (3) we can generate the explanations efficiently.

In this work, a pattern recognition solutionhas been proposed to automate {{the process for}} the achievement of robust results. Thestudy presents a comparison of several pattern recognition techniques together withvarious nonstationary feature extraction techniques for classification of impactacoustic emissions. Pattern classifiers such as multilayer perceptron, learning cectorquantization and gaussian mixture models, are combined with nonstationary featureextraction techniques such as Short Time Fourier Transform, Continuous WaveletTransform, Discrete Wavelet Transform and Wigner-Ville Distribution. Due to thepresence of several different feature extraction and classification technqies, <b>datafusion</b> has been investigated. Data fusion in the current case has mainly beeninvestigated on two levels, feature level and classifier level respectively.

Through the use of commercial models and software we can create a highly detailed scene model, which provides a rich data set for later processing. We embed our own modules within this software to extract data from the scene and then present it to the FLIR and LADAR sensor models. These models produce simulated range and temperature readings for objects within the scene. These data are {{used to create a}} variety of images to aid in the visualisation of the data and test our ATR system.

40|$|High {{fidelity}} {{engineering simulation}} {{plays a key}} role in the rapidly developing field of space-based formation flying. This paper describes the design and implementation of the Formation Algorithms and Simulation Testbed (FAST). 1 This testbed was designed to provide real-time, high-fidelity engineering simulation of multiple spacecraft operating in formation. By distributing the simulation across multiple CPUs, the FAST provides an analyst or software developer with a scalable architecture for examining timing, sensor <b>datafusion,</b> inter-spacecraft communication and system-wide formation robustness. The testbed is designed to maintain a very flight-like feel, with flight software algorithms running on single-board PowerPC 750 VxWorks computers. The flight computers communicate with the distributed simulation computers over a reflective memory interface. As part of recent development and testing activities, the FAST was used to simulate the Formation Control Testbed (FCT). 2 FCT is a ground-based, robotic testbed built at JPL. Each robot uses compressed air to float a five degree of freedom attitude platform over a flat floor. The FCT attitude platform has a flight computer, compressed air thrusters, reaction wheels, gyros and a star tracker. I...|$|E

In this context evaluation means to asses the quality of one solution that is often represented in complex data sets. A very compromising approch to get access to large and complex datasets is visualization. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop and implement cartographic visualization methods to evaluate the quality of results of a datafsuion process in which a geographic datset and a market study were involved. The <b>datafusion</b> was hereby based on a non-detrministic approach, the geteic algorithm. Three visualization methods were developped that are able to present the multivariate solution dataspace of the algorithm on maps. Following the three methods were implemented in a geographical information system (GIS) and the benefit of the visualizations for the evaluation process was assessed. In order to evaluate the visualiization methods, they were applied on three test datasets. It shows that geovisualization is able to contribue to the evaluation process: All three datasets show spatial patterns that could not be recognized in other representations of the data. Performing the task to pick the right solution out of a set it could be shown that the three datsets have different spatial weighpoints of low quality and that some attributes produce outliers. One substantial benefit of visualization is the rapid just-in-time execution of quality assessment during the process of developping the very procedure...|$|E
40|$|By purposefully utilising sensors, for {{instance}} by a <b>datafusion</b> system, {{the state of}} some system-relevant environmentmight be adequately assessed to support decision-making. Theever increasing access to sensors o. ers great opportunities,but alsoincurs grave challenges. As a result of managingmultiple sensors one can, e. g., expect to achieve a morecomprehensive, resolved, certain and more frequently updatedassessment of the environment than would be possible otherwise. Challenges include data association, treatment of con. ictinginformation and strategies for sensor coordination. We use the term information acquisition to denote the skillof a data fusion system to actively acquire information. Theaim of this thesis is to instructively situate that skill in ageneral context, explore and classify related research, andhighlight key issues and possible future work. It is our hopethat this thesis will facilitate communication, understandingand future e. orts for information acquisition. The previously mentioned trend towards utilisation of largesets of sensors makes us especially interested in large-scaleinformation acquisition, i. e., acquisition using many andpossibly spatially distributed and heterogeneous sensors. Information acquisition is a general concept that emerges inmany di. erent. elds of research. In this thesis, we surveyliterature from, e. g., agent theory, robotics and sensormanagement. We, furthermore, suggest a taxonomy of theliterature that highlights relevant aspects of informationacquisition. We describe a function, perception management (akin tosensor management), which realizes information acquisition inthe data fusion process and pertinent properties of itsexternal stimuli, sensing resources, and systemenvironment. An example of perception management is also presented. Thetask is that of managing a set of mobile sensors that jointlytrack some mobile targets. The game theoretic algorithmsuggested for distributing the targets among the sensors proveto be more robust to sensor failure than a measurement accuracyoptimal reference algorithm.

40|$|In this presentation, the specifications, {{advantages}} {{and limits of}} both methods will be presented. With the light section method, a very precise determination of position is possible. Arbitrary surfaces can be surveyed with an accuracy of about 0. 1 mm. 2 D photos can be concatenated. The disadvantages are {{the complexity of the}} experimental set-up as well as the data analysis. Latter will be further developed in the presented work. With active thermography, inhomogeneities below the surface can be detected up to a depth of about 10 cm. A maximum spatial resolution of 0. 3 mm is possible, but can be enhanced by using a close-up lens. For recording of congruent mappings of the object under investigation, first the internal aberrations of the IR cameras have been corrected (internal camera calibration) by using a freeware matlab toolbox. This calibration reveals, that uncorrected thermograms show considerable distortions up to 5 % at the boundaries, which cannot be neglected for <b>datafusion.</b> For facilitating the fusion to the 3 D data, parallel to the capturing of thermograms digital photos are taken from the measurement object. For this, IR camera and digital camera were both mounted into a common frame structure enabling a reproducible relative position. Both methods have been applied to several historic buildings, compiling experimental data that will be presented in the following. Investigations of a sculpture (Madonna with child in the dome of Halberstadt) and of a sandstone column (dome of Magdeburg) are presented. With the help of the introduced approach and the developed software the thermograms can be visualized and analyzed three-dimensional for any complex object geometry. The combination of infrared images of unsteady thermal heat transfer processes with geometric 3 D data enables the discrimination between external geometrical effects due to material properties and internal faults. Temporal changes can be observed with the demanded high local accuracy and damage can be recognized on time...|$|E

40|$|Executive Summary (Zusammenfassung) The DLR project RAiCe (Remote Airport traffic Control center) {{continues}} the project RapTOr (Remote airport Tower Operation research, 2005 - 2007). RapTOr had been launched {{after an initial}} "Virtual Tower" concept study (2002 - 2004), a winner of the first "Visionary Projects" competition of DLR. Within RapTOr an experimental real time and high resolution Augmented Vision Videopanorama Sys-tem was realized and its performance verified as main human machine interface for remote airport tower operation (RTO). The requirement for video based reconstruction of the far view from the tower cab windows was derived from tower work and task analysis. It was emphasized in statements of the international controllers association IFATCA [1]. The follow-up project RAiCe aims at extending the Remote Tower Operation (RTO) system into an experimental Remote Tower Center (RTC) for investi-gating the technological and organizational problems of remote surveillance of several small airports, verifying its basic specifications and functions and validating the performance by shadow mode test-ing. The main experimental result of the RapTOr project as starting point for RAiCe is the verification of the predicted technical system specifications (e. g. 2 arcmin videopanorama resolution, with the given number of 4 high resolution cameras), which can be achieved with {{state of the art}} camera, visualiza-tion and communication technologies. Within RAiCe a second small airport with a realistic distance of some hundred km will be connected to the RTC-HMI which will be based on the RapTOr RTO-Controllers workplace design. This provides the experimental conditions for verifying the possibility of long-distance real time control with visual surveillance. As additional aspect towards the validation of the RTC concept shadow mode testing is planned. It requires connection of the RAiCe operators con-sole to the basic tower data like weather, approach radar and controller–pilot communication. Another goal of RAiCe is the simulation based design of the work environment, i. e. the RTC-HMI which is closely related to the development of an RTC specific work organisation. In order to realize a framework for developing and optimizing the RTC work structure and processes an RTC simulator environment will be set up as extension of the DLR Tower-/ Control center facilities as well as the so called FairControl computer simulation of tower controllers decision making. The latter was developed within the RapTOr project and served for supporting the extraction of domain expert knowledge during interviews with tower controllers by using a simplified airport microworld. Within RAiCe the validation of the Petrinet based controller agent will be continued and FairControl will be extended into a 2 -airport system. Both types of simulations require the definition of traffic and surveillance scenarios which provide the boundary conditions for the HMI design as well as details of simulation hard and software requirements. Surveillance scenarios take into account new and potentially low cost sensing equipment which will be installed at Braunschweig research airport as ASMGCS extension (infrared and mm-wave sensors) as well as increasing GPS/ADSB equipment of aircraft. Sensors and <b>datafusion</b> provide the input into the Augmented Vision System of the Videopanorama. Another surveillance scenario aspect is increased automation which will include visual information assistance based on active vision using the remotely controlled RTO-PTZ camera based on automatic movement detection and data fusion...|$|E
