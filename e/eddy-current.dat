50|$|Although {{the idea}} of an <b>eddy-current</b> sensor was not {{original}} to Bently (In 1958 an <b>eddy-current</b> sensor had already been invented by Pepperl+Fuchs as a replacement for a mechanical switch.), {{he was the first to}} transistorize the design and make it commercially practical. Initially, Bently sold his <b>eddy-current</b> sensing systems via mail order and manufactured them one at a time. In October, 1961, the company was relocated to the small town of Minden, Nevada, and became Bently Nevada Corporation. Its primary operations remain there to this day.|$|E

40|$|Eddy current {{methods are}} a widely used {{technique}} in the nondestructive {{inspection of aircraft}} structures and parts. The method consists of inducing <b>eddy-currents</b> in the material being tested using a probe coil. The magnetic field produced by these <b>eddy-currents</b> opposes that of the probe coils (Lenz’s law) and the net effect is a reduced magnetic flux linking the coil. The presence of defects in the material under test disturbs the distribution of <b>eddy-currents</b> which in turn disturbs the net field. This change {{in the field is}} detected as a change in the impedance of the coil. The changes in coil impedance measured as the probe scans the specimen contitutes an eddy current defect signa...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of modeling and system identification efforts on the NASA Large-Angle Magnetic Suspension Test Fixture (LAMSTF). The LAMSTF consists of a cylindrical permanent magnet which is levitated above a planar array of five electromagnets mounted in a circular configuration. The analytical model is first developed and open-loop characteristics are described. The system is shown to be highly unstable and requires feedback control in order to apply system identification. Limitations on modeling accuracy due to the effect of <b>eddy-currents</b> on the system are discussed. An algorithm is derived to identify a state-space model for the system from input/output data acquired during closed-loop operation. The algorithm is tested on both the baseline system and a perturbed system which has an increased presence of eddy currents. It is found that for the baseline system the analytic model adequately captures the dynamics, although the identified model improves the simulation accuracy. For the system perturbed by additional unmodeled <b>eddy-currents</b> the analytic model is no longer adequate and a higher-order model, determined through system identification, is required to accurately predict the system's time response...|$|R

50|$|Aggressive {{throttle}} movements, {{engine speed}} changes, and engine motoring are characteristics of most transient engine tests. The usual {{purpose of these}} tests are vehicle emissions development and homologation. In some cases, the lower-cost <b>eddy-current</b> dynamometer is used to test one of the transient test cycles for early development and calibration. An eddy current dyno system offers fast load response, which allows rapid tracking of speed and load, but does not allow motoring. Since most required transient tests contain {{a significant amount of}} motoring operation, a transient test cycle with an <b>eddy-current</b> dyno will generate different emissions test results. Final adjustments are required to be done on a motoring-capable dyno.|$|E
