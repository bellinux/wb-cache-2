25|$|By {{the time}} I {{made my way}} to where <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> it was still unclear what was going on. The guardsmen {{themselves}} looked stunned. We looked at them and they looked at us. They were just kids, 19 years old, like us. But in uniform. Like our boys in Vietnam.|$|E
500|$|While {{searching for}} investors, Nagy and Berwin {{learned that the}} {{homosexuality}} of the characters was not {{as much of an}} obstacle for securing financing as {{the fact that they were}} women. [...] "Having two women leads was the issue," [...] Nagy noted. In 2015, Berwin said that, in those days, it was a risky idea to play the role of Carol. [...] "As a project it came together with Cate Blanchett. You needed to always start with her role". Film4 Productions and Tessa Ross financed the development of the film and kept it alive throughout the years, as it [...] "underwent a decade-plus of revision under various directors and investors" [...] − including Hettie MacDonald, Kenneth Branagh, Kimberly Peirce, John Maybury, and Stephen Frears − until the project completely stalled. The long trek was a result of the struggles and roadblocks experienced with funding, rights, and trepidations about a film with a gay theme and two female leads. [...] "During its development, there was a very different kind of lesbian or gay movie that got financed", Nagy said. [...] "They were very agenda or issue driven, and this was not. In fact it insists on not being that in order to make the point. I would talk about that with financiers, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> glaze over." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{started to}} see people that weren't there. She thought <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> too, but, of course, I couldn't. I would make fun of her like, [...] "I'm {{going to go in}} the other room and you stay here and talk to your friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> folks made happier," [...] {{he said to}} himself--"If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>'em</b> {{myself and}} hear 'em express their {{gratitude}} for what I done for 'em it would make me feel better. This donatin' funds to institutions and societies is about as satisfactory as dropping money into a broken slot machine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do I ken, your lordship? Looking down at {{them from}} the Warden's Tower, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> but <b>see</b> <b>them</b> glent by wi' their bridles ringing and their {{feathers}} fluttering, like the court of Elfland." ...|$|R
60|$|TEIG. In {{the bush}} beyond, There are two birds--if {{you can call}} <b>them</b> birds-- <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>them</b> rightly for the leaves. But they've the shape and colour of horned owls And I'm half certain they've a human face.|$|R
2500|$|Stranger in a Strange Land {{was written}} in part as a {{deliberate}} attempt to challenge social mores. In {{the course of the}} story, Heinlein uses Smith's open-mindedness to reevaluate such institutions as religion, money, monogamy, and the fear of death. Heinlein completed writing it ten years after he had plotted it out in detail. He later wrote, [...] "I had been in no hurry to finish it, as that story could not be published commercially until the public mores changed. [...] <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> changing {{and it turned out that}} I had timed it right." ...|$|E
2500|$|With a {{capacity}} of 8,500, the Field House was packed. The home crowd waved U.S. flags and sang patriotic songs such as [...] "God Bless America". Before the game, Brooks read his players a statement he had written out {{on a piece of}} paper, telling them that [...] "You were born to be a player. You were meant to be here. This moment is yours." [...] Brooks believed they could win and later said, [...] "The Russians were ready to cut their own throats. But we had {{to get to the point}} to be ready to pick up the knife and hand it to them. So the morning of the game I called the team together and told them, 'It's meant to be. This is your moment and it's going to happen.' It's kind of corny and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> thinking, 'Here goes Herb again....' But I believed it." ...|$|E
60|$|The form of {{her lips}} (<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> under the brim of her hat) was {{suddenly}} altered into a line of seriousness. The parasol stopped swinging.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{not have}} been in a more distressed state if I had been {{escaping}} justice with a price on my head. Then the miners appeared to sit down on a boulder, though <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>them</b> distinctly enough to be very sure what they did. One said: ...|$|R
6000|$|I had not {{the heart}} to make the dear little fellow go through his {{troubles}} a second time, so hastily begged the Professor to push the hands round into their former position. In a moment Sylvie and Bruno were gone again, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> just <b>see</b> <b>them</b> in the far distance, picking 'dindledums.' ...|$|R
6000|$|It is sunset in this {{wonderful}} summer land. At home in [...] Sweetwater {{it is only}} early spring as yet, with snow lingering [...] {{along the edges of}} the woods. The sunsets there will be [...] creamy-yellow and pale red now. If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> but <b>see</b> <b>them</b> once [...] more! And Sylvia-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing {{to speak}} of," [...] Will replied. [...] "I am a bit shaken, and bruised by the fall. Those fellows, in the darkness, were upon me before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{leaned against}} the tree-hole {{plaiting}} and unplaiting chance-plucked grass stems. The children in the wood had drawn nearer. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> with the tail of my eye frolicking like squirrels.|$|E
6000|$|Yes, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>them,</b> feel them, hear them, {{address them}} - [...] Halo-bedecked - And, alas, onwards, shaken by fierce unreason, [...] Rigid in hate, Smitten by years-long wryness born of misprision, [...] Dreaded, suspect.|$|E
60|$|Seated on a {{rock with}} their backs towards us were {{a man and a}} woman. The man was dressed in goatskins, and his whiskers, so I {{inferred}} from what <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> of <b>them</b> from the side, were at least as exuberant as mine. The woman was in white fur with a fillet of seaweed round her head. They were sitting close together as if in earnest colloquy.|$|R
60|$|I {{adopted the}} plan. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>them</b> very clearly. I aimed rather at the noise; and I had thrown about twenty choice lumps without effect, and was feeling {{somewhat}} discouraged, when a yell, followed by language singularly unappropriate to the season, {{told me that}} Providence had aided my arm. The music ceased suddenly, and the party dispersed, apparently in high glee--which struck me as curious.|$|R
60|$|Then they trooped {{into the}} cabin. Buell headed the line, and Herky, sullenly {{reloading}} his revolver, came last. At first they groped {{around in the}} dim light, stumbling over everything. Part {{of the time they}} were in the light space near the door, and the rest <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>them.</b> <b>I</b> scarcely dared to breathe. I felt a creepy chill, and my eyesight grew dim.|$|R
6000|$|I didn't hope so. They all crowded up {{and leaned}} over the rails, nearly in my face, and kept still, {{watching}} with all their might. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> first-rate, but they couldn't see me. Then the captain sung out: ...|$|E
60|$|He had drank {{wine that}} evening (or I fancied it), until {{his eyes were}} bloodshot. Not that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> now, for they were cast down, and shaded by his hand; but I had noticed them a little while before.|$|E
60|$|Away on {{the western}} rim, where we could look down upon a long rugged iron-gray ridge of mountain, our guide using the glass, found two big stags. We all had our fill of looking. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> plainly with naked eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is within}} the city limits and well within them." [...] I argued. [...] "Don't {{think that you have}} picked up a greenhorn Yankee. Do you see those hills over there?" [...] I went on, {{pointing}} toward the east (<b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>them,</b> myself, for the drizzle); [...] "well, I was born and raised on their other side. You old fool nigger, can't you tell people from other people when you see 'em?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{went across}} {{to the door and}} turned the key in it. Then he opened the cabinet and took out some things there. It was growing quite dusk, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>see</b> <b>them.</b> He {{returned}} with them where you stood, struggling in vain to set yourself free. His voice was as hard as adamant now. He spoke slowly and distinctly, in a voice like a fiend's. Oh, Jack, no wonder that scene took away my reason!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There wasn't much difference, {{so far as}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> between <b>them</b> {{and most}} of us," [...] {{answered}} the little old lady. [...] "You're not married, dear," [...] she continued, glancing at Joan's ungloved hand, [...] "but people must have a deal of patience {{when they have to}} live with us for twenty-four hours a day. You see, little things we do and say without thinking, and little ways we have that we do not notice ourselves, may all the time be irritating to other people." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> {{pulling away}} some {{distance}} from the ship. It was easy to see things now, for the fire was blazing up in front. I think the vessel had been put around, for she rolled a good deal, and the smoke was not coming back over us.|$|E
60|$|From left, right, and centre our rifles loosed in a volley. I had popped my head up to see, and I {{could make}} out more than one {{stricken}} Indian. Their fire immediately ceased, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> scampering back on foot across the open, dragging their dead and wounded with them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Half an {{hour before}} the sun sank, I started. No {{horsemen}} were in sight, and if any were to come along, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> long before they could notice me. Knowing the general direction, I was fortunate enough to get sight of the palm grove which surrounded the wells, before darkness set in.|$|E
60|$|Then I {{knew it was}} he who had cleaned my boots. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> him {{fingering}} <b>them</b> {{and wondering}} over them. I rather liked him. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> he had had imagination once, and a certain fineness of nature. Now he was corrupted with drink, too far gone to be even a human being. I hated the village.|$|R
6000|$|Harper {{stared at}} him, and then {{broke into a}} {{somewhat}} hollow laugh. “It’s a fact,” he said. “I was kind of wondering if it wasn’t time Pancho {{or one of the}} other men came back. <b>I</b> guess one <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> on the tram‐ line from the roof. Morales will be here in an hour or two.” ...|$|R
60|$|But Mahmoud and his {{followers}} no doubt kept their own counsel as to that little mistake. There they went, and the gentle rippling breeze filled their sail pleasantly, as the boat moved away into the bay. I felt no spite against any of them but Mahmoud. Why had he avoided me with such cowardice? <b>I</b> <b>could</b> still <b>see</b> <b>them</b> when the morning tchibouk was handed to Sir George; and, though I wished him no harm, I did envy him as he lay there reclining luxuriously upon the cushions.|$|R
60|$|We had {{of course}} joined {{the crowd in}} pushing forward; people always do, though they promise {{themselves}} to wait till the last one is out. I got caught in a dark eddy on the first stair-landing; but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> farther down, and I knew they would wait for me outside the door.|$|E
6000|$|... {{and there}} all my memory dislimns and decays. But I {{could still see}} quite vividly the plain {{plastered}} walls and the rude, irregular writing, and {{the places where the}} red chalk broke. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>them,</b> I mean, in memory; for when I came down that road again after a sixth of a century the house was very different.|$|E
6000|$|... "I care {{little for}} that," [...] {{answered}} Quentin Durward; [...] "I bear a Scottish tongue in my head, {{bold enough to}} speak my mind to King Louis's face, God bless him--and for the ears you talk of, if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> growing on a human head, I would crop them out of it with my wood knife." ...|$|E
6000|$|Waitukurau. [...] Twenty {{minutes for}} luncheon. With me sat {{my wife and}} daughter, and my manager, Mr. Carlyle Smythe. I sat {{at the head of}} the table, and <b>could</b> <b>see</b> the {{right-hand}} wall; the others had their backs to it. On that wall, at a good distance away, were a couple of framed pictures. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>them</b> clearly, but from the groupings of the figures I fancied that they represented the killing of Napoleon III's son by the Zulus in South Africa. I broke into the conversation, which was about poetry and cabbage and art, and said to my wife-- ...|$|R
60|$|My word, their hubbub soon {{died away}} when we opened our ranks, and showed whom we had {{got in the}} midst of us! There was silence for a few seconds, and then such a howl of rage and grief! <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> some of <b>them</b> dancing like mad-men upon the wall. He must have been a {{singular}} person, this prisoner of ours, to have gained the affection of such a gang.|$|R
60|$|Both {{doors and}} lattices were open; and yet, as {{is usually the}} case in a coal-district, a fine red fire illumined the chimney: the comfort which the eye derives from it renders the extra heat endurable. But the house of Wuthering Heights is so large that the inmates have plenty of space for {{withdrawing}} out of its influence; and accordingly what inmates there were had stationed themselves not far {{from one of the}} windows. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> both <b>see</b> <b>them</b> and hear them talk before I entered, and looked and listened in consequence; being moved thereto by a mingled sense of curiosity and envy, that grew as I lingered.|$|R
