40|$|Pain is a {{subjective}} condition and, thus, difficult to measure. The best tools to assess pain are the pain <b>evaluation</b> <b>questionnaires,</b> which provide either diagnostic, pain evolution or pain intensity information. To provide information which could help differentiate between nociceptive pain and neuropathic pain {{is one of}} the most important functions of these questionnaires. The questionnaires can measure pain intensity, quality of life, or sleep quality. Quality of life and sleep are two really important characteristics to assess the pain impact on patients' life. Pain intensity assessing <b>questionnaires</b> combine physical <b>evaluations</b> with questions, providing information either from the patient sensations or clinical assessment of pain manifestations as well as the underlying biological mechanisms (such as hyperalgesia or allodynia). For example, the Pain Detect questionnaire has two parts: the patient form (intuitive, with pictures and easy understandable) and the physician form. Thus, in this questionnaire, subjective information is provided by the patient and the objective one is provided by the physician. Other pain intensity questionnaires are NPSI, DN 4, LANSS or StEP. Quality of life questionnaires are versatile (can be used in different pathologies). These questionnaires include functional self-evaluation questions, and other ones associated to physical and mental health. Two of such quality of life questionnaires are SF- 36 and NHP. Sleep <b>evaluation</b> <b>questionnaires</b> include quantitative features such as the number of sleep interruptions, sleep latency or sleep duration as well as qualitative characteristics such as rest sensation, mood and dreams. One of the most used sleep <b>evaluation</b> <b>questionnaires</b> is PSQI, which includes patient questions and bed-partner questions, providing information from two points of view.

40|$|OBJECTIVES First {{to compare}} pain and {{functional}} disability in tennis elbow (TE) patients with healthy controls. Second, {{to evaluate the}} relationship between the 2 major psychologic factors (anxiety and depression) and TE. METHODS Sixteen TE patients were recruited from 46 consecutive attendees at an upper limb clinic: inclusion criteria were lateral epicondyle tenderness, pain with resisted wrist and middle finger extension and at least 3 months localized lateral elbow pain. Sixteen healthy controls with no upper limb problem were recruited from students and staff. Participants were given 4 questionnaires, together with instructions for completion: Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand, Patient-Rated Forearm <b>Evaluation</b> <b>Questionnaire,</b> Patient-Rated Wrist <b>Evaluation</b> <b>Questionnaire,</b> and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The independent t test was used to compare the total and subscale scores between the groups. RESULTS Significantly higher scores were found in TE for pain and function subscales and also total score for Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand, Patient-Rated Forearm <b>Evaluation</b> <b>Questionnaire,</b> and Patient-Rated Wrist <b>Evaluation</b> <b>Questionnaire.</b> For Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, both anxiety and depression subscales (P 11).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the initial stage of developing an algorithm learning {{tool for the}} students of the Information Systems course at Tokyo Tech High School of Science and Technology in Japan. The tool applies the concept of Algorithm Visualization (AV) technology and {{was used as an}} aid for learning basic algorithms such as searching and sorting. Two AV types were included in the tool, one with more input options and control and the other with less. Previously proposed AV evaluation properties and the Categories of Algorithm Learning Objectives (CALO) were considered in designing the tool’s <b>evaluation</b> <b>questionnaire.</b> Written tests based on CALO were also designed. Posttest results indicate moderate improvement in the performance of the students. Test results also show that student abilities match some of the algorithm learning objectives. The students who used the AV with more options have a slightly higher gain score average in the posttest compared with those who used the AV with limited control. Overall assessment indicates a positive evaluation of the tool and signifies the students’ preferred AV characteristics. After factor analysis of the <b>evaluation</b> <b>questionnaire,</b> three factors were extracted which correspond to the suggested AV evaluation properties. These results may be used in improving the learning tool and the <b>evaluation</b> <b>questionnaire...</b>|$|E
