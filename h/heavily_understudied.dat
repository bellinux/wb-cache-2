3000|$|A common {{approach}} when studying driver sleepiness {{is to use}} sleep deprived drivers [18 – 20]. Usually, the drivers are in an alert condition during daytime and in a sleep deprived condition during night-time. One consequence of such a study design {{is that there is}} a confounding effect between the sleep-related factor day versus night (circadian effect) and between the factor alert versus sleep deprived (homeostatic effect) [21]. In addition, there is also an effect of fatigue-related factors such as time on task and boredom. The consequences of driving under this mixture of causal factors are <b>heavily</b> <b>understudied</b> in the research literature. For example, is a driver more likely crash during the night-time compared to daytime, when the sleepiness level being experienced is the same in the two conditions? [...]...|$|E
40|$|Professional {{networks}} of senior managers have indisputable value {{for them as}} well as for their organizations. In recent years, much attention has been given to the structure of these networks as it reflects senior managers’ opportunity to access valuable resources. Surprisingly, the actual resources that senior managers acquire through their network ties, i. e. the tie content, remain <b>heavily</b> <b>understudied.</b> Hence, the purpose of this dissertation is to answer the following question: What resources flow through informal ties in senior managers’ professional networks, and why? The first chapter introduces the topic of this dissertation as well as the overall research question. The three next chapters are empirical studies of informal ties in professional {{networks of}} Danish senior managers, that together attempt to answer the overall research question. Chapter 2 looks into gender differences in resource exchanges and the effect of these differences on the number of, and extent to which, resources are provided by a network tie. Chapter 3 explores how firm underperfomance and social identity with corporate elite alter types of resources a network tie provides. Chapter 4 focuses on a tie’s internal dynamics and studies the effect of friendship on the extent and novelty of professional advice a tie provides. The fifth and final chapter of this dissertation summarizes the findings of the research papers {{in the light of the}} overall research question. Essentially, this dissertation suggests that the strategic value of professional informal network ties is contingent on the actual combination of resources these ties provide. Furthermore, this combination depends on micro-level mechanisms that affect three dimensions of tie content: the number of resources, the type of resources and the extent to which these resources are provided by informal network ties...|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of globalization, {{two thirds of the}} world’s {{business}} takes place nowadays in the service sector. In line, professional service firms are growing their share of the global service production. However, saturation of the professional service sector has forced professional service firms to search for more heuristic ways to conduct business in the international markets. By leveraging effectively the firm’s professionals, a professional service firm can lower its costs to clients and simultaneously generate additional value for the company and thus gain competitive advantage. Even though the academic field has shown growing interest towards services for decades, the fields of service productization and service internationalization are <b>heavily</b> <b>understudied</b> even today. Hence, the objective {{of this study was to}} contribute to the research on professional service internationalization and productization. The study concentrated on examining the impact that productization has on knowledge sharing and leveraging in professional service firms operating internationally. The research question focused on examining what implications productization has on knowledge transfer and leveraging during professional service internationalization by leaning on the existing research and on an empirical research. The empirical research was conducted as a single case study within a professional service firm operating in debt-related administrative service business. The case company is one of the leading operators in its field of business and therefore offered a fruitful environment to observe and analyze the topics in question. Additionally, the case company has a strong international presence and a large scale of operations in the selected markets, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Based on the previous literature and on the empirical research, this study found that for professional service firms to efficiently utilize individual, tacit knowledge, in its internationalization processes, it must be shared with the whole organization. By exploiting productization as a knowledge leveraging mechanism, a PSF can apply and transfer knowledge profoundly during its internationalization processes that would otherwise be difficult to tap into. Productization might not be sufficient alone, but by complementing it with a favorable organizational structure and culture, and by encouraging open communication, a PSF may take advantage of the whole potential that productization has to offer...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Evidence {{is limited}} {{regarding}} {{the most effective}} pharmacological treatment for psychotic depression: combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic, monotherapy with an antidepressant or monotherapy with an antipsychotic. This is an update of a review first published in 2005 and last updated in 2009. OBJECTIVES: 1. To compare the clinical efficacy of pharmacological treatments for patients with an acute psychotic depression: antidepressant monotherapy, antipsychotic monotherapy and the combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic, compared with each other and/or with placebo. 2. To assess whether differences in response to treatment in the current episode are related to non-response to prior treatment. SEARCH METHODS: A search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Register (CCDANCTR) was carried out (to 12 April 2013). These registers include reports of randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: EMBASE (1970 -), MEDLINE (1950 -) and PsycINFO (1960 -). Reference lists of all studies and related reviews were screened and key authors contacted. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that included participants with acute major depression with psychotic features, as well as RCTs consisting of participants with acute major depression with or without psychotic features, that reported separately on the subgroup of participants with psychotic features. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias in the included studies, according to the criteria of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Data were entered into RevMan 5. 1. We used intention-to-treat data. For dichotomous efficacy outcomes, the risk ratio (RR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) was calculated. For continuously distributed outcomes, {{it was not possible}} to extract data from the RCTs. Regarding the primary outcome of harm, only overall dropout rates were available for all studies. MAIN RESULTS: The search identified 3659 abstracts, but only 12 RCTs with a total of 929 participants could be included in the review. Because of clinical heterogeneity, few meta-analyses were possible. The main outcome was reduction of severity (response) of depression, not of psychosis. We found no evidence for the efficacy of monotherapy with an antidepressant or an antipsychotic. However, evidence suggests that the combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic is more effective than antidepressant monotherapy (three RCTs; RR 1. 49, 95 % CI 1. 12 to 1. 98, P = 0. 006), more effective than antipsychotic monotherapy (four RCTs; RR 1. 83, 95 % CI 1. 40 to 2. 38, P = 0. 00001) and more effective than placebo (two identical RCTs; RR 1. 86, 95 % CI 1. 23 to 2. 82, P = 0. 003). Risk of bias is considerable: there were differences between studies with regard to diagnosis, uncertainties around randomisation and allocation concealment, differences in treatment interventions (pharmacological differences between the various antidepressants and antipsychotics) and different outcome criteria. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Psychotic depression is <b>heavily</b> <b>understudied,</b> limiting confidence in the conclusions drawn. Some evidence indicates that combination therapy with an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic is more effective than either treatment alone or placebo. Evidence is limited for treatment with an antidepressant alone or with an antipsychotic alone...|$|E
