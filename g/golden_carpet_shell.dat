40|$|During {{a week of}} {{fieldwork}} {{along the coast of}} Normandy, France, the author found a tropical <b>carpet</b> <b>shell</b> on the beach of Granville. Field guides could not properly identify the shell and therefore it was compared with the collections of the National Museum of Natural History in Leiden and the Zoological Museum of Amsterdam. This comparison resulted in four possible identifications - Ruditapes variegatus, Venerupis aurea, Ruditapes philippinarum and Ruditapes semidecussatus. However, the specific shell colour pattern does not fully correspond with the pattern of these four species, making identification of the shell difficult. The most likely identification seems to be Ruditapes semidecussatus. In France <b>carpet</b> <b>shells</b> are cultured for consumption. The tropical <b>carpet</b> <b>shell</b> Rudiapes philippinarum has been cultured since 1972. This species can now be found outside of its cultivation areas, from the Gulf of Biscay to Brittany.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the presence of Salmonella spp., verotoxigenic E. coli (VTEC), Vibrio spp., and Norovirus GI-GII in bivalve molluscs, cockles, and European grooved <b>carpet</b> <b>shells</b> (Cerastoderma spp. and Ruditapes decussatus) collected from a class B growing natural bed in Sardinia (Italy). All of the samples were analysed for Salmonella spp. detection according to European Commission Regulation (EC) 2285 / 2015. Detection and enumeration of Vibrio spp. were performed according to previously published methods. Presumptive identification of Vibrio spp. isolates was performed by means of conventional biochemical tests. E. coli VTEC was isolated following a direct multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening test. Norovirus GI and GII were determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). No Salmonella spp. were detected. The prevalence of Vibrio spp. was 90 %, and the average contamination levels were 3. 19 ± 1. 07 and 2. 84 ± 0. 31 Log 10 cfu/g in cockles and European grooved <b>carpet</b> <b>shells,</b> respectively. The prevalence of E. coli VTEC was 6. 6 %. All of the isolates showed a complete pathogenicity profile. The presence of Norovirus was highlighted in 25 % of European grooved <b>carpet</b> <b>shells</b> samples.

40|$|Two {{episodes of}} {{mortality}} of cultured <b>carpet</b> <b>shell</b> clams (Ruditapes decussatus) associated with bacterial infections were recorded during 2001 and 2002 {{in a commercial}} hatchery located in Spain. Vibrio alginolyticus was isolated as the primary organism from moribund clam larvae that were obtained during the two separate events. Vibrio splendidus biovar II, in addition to V. alginolyticus, was isolated {{as a result of}} a mixed Vibrio infection from moribund clam larvae obtained from the second mortality event. The larval mortality rates for these events were 62 and 73 %, respectively. Mortality was also detected in spat. To our knowledge, this is the fist time that these bacterial species have been associated with larval and juvenile <b>carpet</b> <b>shell</b> clam mortality. The bacterial strains were identified by morphological and biochemical techniques and also by PCR and sequencing of a conserved region of the 16 S rRNA gene. In both cases bacteria isolated in pure culture were inoculated into spat of <b>carpet</b> <b>shell</b> clams by intravalvar injection and by immersion. The mortality was attributed to the inoculated strains, since the bacteria were obtained in pure culture from the soft tissues of experimentally infected clams. V. alginolyticus TA 15 and V. splendidus biovar II strain TA 2 caused similar histological lesions that affected mainly the mantle, the velum, and the connective tissue of infected organisms. The general enzymatic activity of both live cells and extracellular products (ECPs), as evaluated by the API ZYM system, revealed that whole bacterial cells showed greater enzymatic activity than ECPs and that the activity of most enzymes ceased after heat treatment (100 °C for 10 min). Both strain TA 15 and strain TA 2 produced hydroxamate siderophores, although the activity was greater in strain TA 15. ECPs from both bacterial species at high concentrations, as well as viable bacteria, caused significant reductions in hemocyte survival after 4 h of incubation, whereas no significant differences in viability were observed during incubation with heat-killed bacteria...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe inter-species {{variability}} of contamination by domoic acid (DA), okadaic acid and analogues (OAs) and spirolides (SPX) in mussels, oysters, cockles, <b>carpet</b> <b>shell</b> clams and razor clams was assessed. DA concentrations were measured using both high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with Ultra Violet (UV) detection and HPLC coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS); OAs and SPX were measured using HPLC-MS/MS.

For DA and SPX, cockles appear to be the most contaminated species whereas mussels seem to be the predominant vector for OAs. The effect of cooking process on DA concentrations was investigated in five different bivalve species by comparing toxin concentrations in whole raw flesh with concentrations in whole cooked flesh. The DA concentration decreased in cooked cockles and razor clams whereas it increased in cooked mussels, <b>carpet</b> <b>shell</b> clams and donax. Thus the impact of cooking is bivalve species-dependent. For OAs and SPX, the cooking process was studied on mussels and resulted in an increase in the toxin concentration because of their lipophilic nature. These results should be taken into consideration in exposure assessments and in the design of regulatory monitoring programs, as the current banning levels based on raw bivalves may over- or under-protect consumers when shellfish are eaten cooked...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The Grooved <b>Carpet</b> <b>shell</b> clam Ruditapes decussatus is the {{autochthonous}} European clam and {{the most}} appreciated from a gastronomic and economic point of view. The production is in decline due to several factors such as Perkinsiosis and habitat invasion and competition by the introduced exotic species, the manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum. After we sequenced R. decussatus transcriptome we have designed an oligo microarray capable of contributing to provide some clues on molecular response of the clam to Perkinsiosis. Results A database consisting of 41, 119 unique transcripts was constructed, of which 12, 479 (30. 3 %) were annotated by similarity. An oligo-DNA microarray platform was then designed and applied to profile gene expression in R. decussatus heavily infected by Perkinsus olseni. Functional annotation of differentially expressed genes between those two conditionswas performed by gene set enrichment analysis. As expected, microarrays unveil genes related with stress/infectious agents such as hydrolases, proteases and others. The extensive role of innate immune system was also analyzed and effect of parasitosis upon expression of important molecules such as lectins reviewed. Conclusions This study represents a first attempt to characterize Ruditapes decussatus transcriptome, an important marine resource for the European aquaculture. The trancriptome sequencing and consequent annotation will increase the available tools and resources for this specie, introducing the possibility of high throughput experiments such as microarrays analysis. In this specific case microarray approach was used to unveil some important aspects of host-parasite interaction between the <b>Carpet</b> <b>shell</b> clam and Perkinsus, two non-model species, highlighting some genes associated with this interaction.
