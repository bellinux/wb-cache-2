In one example, Daniel Dick, an 18-year-old was vacationing in Hawaii with his family. He was warned by witnesses to stay away and not climb on the rocks. It was said that he wanted to feel the water hit his chest. Thirty seconds later, his wish had been granted and people watched in amazement as he straddled the blowhole. Suddenly, a wave came shooting a blast of water through the hole, launching young Daniel five feet into the air. His body was found the next day.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to review the {{literature}} on the recognition of the early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> of schizophrenia. The occurence of psychotic relapse is characteristic of schizophrenia. Preventing psychotic relapse is important in the treatment for patients with schizophrenia. Identifying early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> can reduce the incidence of psychotic relapse. It is important to make a clear conceptual distinction between early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> and psychotic symptoms. Studies indicate that between 5 0 % to 70 % of people experience early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> over a period of one to four weeks prior to a relapse. Early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> of schizophrenia show a mixture of psychotic and non-psychotic symptoms. Early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> were identified as hallucinations, suspiciousness, change in sleep, anxiety, anger-hostility, disruptive inappropriate behaviour, depression, suicidal ideas, nervousness, increased tension, cognitive inefficiency. Systematic monitoring of early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> is an important part of the treatment strategy.

40|$|In present time, the {{guidelines}} on <b>warning</b> <b>sign</b> {{position in the}} China National Standard lack detailed and standard regulations of placing <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> on sharp curves, which may cause road safety problems. Therefore, this paper briefly discussed how to optimize {{the position of a}} <b>warning</b> <b>sign</b> on a sharp curve through a driving simulator experiment. This study concluded that a <b>warning</b> <b>sign</b> placed at different positions prior to a sharp curve will have different influence ranges for drivers approaching and negotiating the curve. Meanwhile, different positions of a <b>warning</b> <b>sign</b> imposed different effect obviously on the adjustment of vehicle's lane position on sharp curves with the same radius, especially at the midpoint of a sharp curve. The evaluation results of five positions (0 m, 50 m, 100 m, 200 m, and 400 m in advance) showed that only when the <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> were placed 100 m or 200 m prior to sharp curves, can they achieve positive influence on driving behavior. On this basis, the authors look forward to providing rationalization proposals in selecting the best position of a <b>warning</b> <b>sign</b> on a sharp curve for the engineering implementation and national standard...|$|R
40|$|Aims and objectives. The Forensic Early Warning Signs of Aggression Inventory (FESAI) was {{developed}} to assist nurses and patients in identifying early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> and constructing individual early detection plans (EDP) {{for the prevention of}} aggressive incidents. The aims of this research were as follows: First, to study the prevalence of early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> of aggression, measured with the FESAI, in a sample of forensic patients, and second, to explore whether there are any types of <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> typical of diagnostic subgroups or offender subgroups. Background. Reconstructing patients’ changes in behaviour prior to aggressive incidents may contribute to identify early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> specific to the individual patient. The EDP comprises an early intervention strategy suggested by the patient and approved by the nurses. Implementation of EDP may enhance efficient risk assessment and management. Design. An explorative design was used to review existing records and to monitor frequencies of early <b>warning</b> <b>signs.</b> Methods. Early detection plans of 171 patients from two forensic hospital wards were examined. Frequency distributions were estimated by recording the early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> on the FESAI. Rank order correlation analyses were conducted to compare diagnostic subgroups and offender subgroups concerning types and frequencies of <b>warning</b> <b>signs.</b> Results. The FESAI categories with the highest frequency rank were the following: (1) anger, (2) social withdrawal, (3) superficial contact and (4) non-aggressive antisocial behaviour. There {{were no significant differences between}} subgroups of patients concerning the ranks of the four categories of early <b>warning</b> <b>signs.</b> Conclusion. The results suggest that the FESAI covers very well the wide variety of occurred <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> reported in the EDPs. No group profiles of <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> were found to be specific to diagnosis or offence type. Relevance to clinical practice. Applying the FESAI to develop individual EDPs appears to be a promising approach to enhance risk assessment and management...|$|R

40|$|A {{proactive}} {{risk management}} strategy seeks to prevent accidents from taking place {{and maintain the}} safety of a system. In this context, the task of identifying and disseminating early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> and signals is among the most important. The problem is that <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> that are present before an accident takes place are often being overlooked and not picked up or identified as <b>warning</b> <b>signs.</b> If these <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> were responded to, then an accident may be averted. Accidents occuring in the critical domain of a drinking water treatments works can have serious implications for the public health of consumers of the water supplied. Realising and comprehending early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> is a major challenge for the domain of systems safety and especially in the domain of a water treatment works. The approaches that are typically used to enhance the realisation, comprehension and dissemination of early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> in the water treatment domain in Ireland mainly involves the creation of accident scenarios, the use of monitoring data and procedures for the dissemination of warnings. While all of these approaches are all useful to inform the mental or process models of possible accident scenarios, nevertheless, accidents are still occurring in this domain. Therefore, a new approach to enhance the comprehension of and effective dissemination of early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> is required in order to improve safety and proactive risk management strategies. The contributions of this thesis is the provision of a set of attributes associated with the early <b>warning</b> <b>sign</b> concept that provides meaningful data on the early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> and allows recipients to better comprehend them.

30|$|Implementation of <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> (e.g., {{enhanced}} caution signs, temporary signs, dynamic {{or variable}} message signs (VMS) and animal-activated <b>warning</b> <b>signs)</b> may induce speed reductions [39 – 44], but such studies have mainly been performed under experimentally uncontrolled circumstances. When wildlife <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> were applied under controlled conditions (i.e. in driving simulations), conventional signs and VMS reduced speed after 300  m but standard deer <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> did not [45]. However, in a driving simulator experiment implementing the European standardised triangular animal <b>warning</b> <b>sign</b> (used by countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals (UN, 1968), it was showed that the sign caused speed reductions both when encountering the sign (200 – 0  m) and 300 – 500  m afterwards [24]. Yet, {{at a distance of}} 300 – 500  m, the wildlife <b>warning</b> <b>sign</b> did have a slightly less speed reducing effect than an in-vehicle radio warning message and the velocity profiles revealed that the effects between treatments differed.
