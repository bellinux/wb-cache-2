25|$|Patrik Jensen and Jonas Björler had a {{discussion}} at Jonas' own 40th birthday party, as to not letting The Haunted disband, and when Jensen asked Björler {{as to who}} should be the new vocalist in the band, Björler could only think of former member, Marco Aro. A few days after, Jensen phoned Aro to rejoin The Haunted. Aro had missed being in the band and tempted to rejoin but at first was hesitant due hectic touring he had done with the band in the past, which Aro {{was not interested in}} doing, but The Haunted had done it for almost a decade straight after Aro left, getting all the touring out of them. More hesitation came when Aro struggled with drug addiction back then and with him {{to be back in the}} band again, he didn't want it to reoccur as it had also given him problems within his family, who he needed to discuss rejoining the band with also. Aro is also in the band The Resistance and didn't want to have conflicting schedules with both bands, so he had to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> with The Resistance as well. Aro had told Jensen he'd give him a response two weeks later. By then, the band had shown him the a breakdown of future tours, which interested Aro to rejoin The Haunted. Before publicly revealing information of the band's new lineup, Aro only stated there was good news coming from the band. His picture was in a silhouette on the band's official Facebook the day before the band announced a new line-up. Adrian Erlandsson, a former member, returned to the band also and Ola Englund from Six Feet Under was brought in as the band's new lead guitarist. The band then began writing for an EP titled Eye of the Storm which was released on 20 January 2014 in Europe and 21 January 2014 in North America. The band had also been rehearsing before the announcement of the new lineup to perform for the first time live with this lineup at the 70000 Tons of Metal which sat sail 27–31 January 2014.|$|E

500|$|... « Courante »: Aue thus takes part in {{the final}} phase of the {{struggle}} for Stalingrad. As with the massacres, he is mostly an observer, the narrator rather than the combatant. In the midst of the mayhem and starvation, he manages to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> with a captured Soviet political commissar about the similarities between the Nazi and the Bolshevik world views, and once again is able to indicate his intellectual support for Nazi ideas. Aue gets shot in the head and seriously wounded, but is miraculously evacuated just before the German surrender in February 1943.|$|E
500|$|During one scene, Ann and Mark <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> at J.J.'s Diner, a Pawnee {{restaurant}} {{that had previously}} been featured in the episodes [...] "The Reporter" [...] and [...] "Summer Catalog". In all three episodes, a different interior set is used, although the exterior building shots are the same. At the Snakehole Lounge, Tom flirts with a woman by giving her a bottle cap [...] "to remember him by", then later unsuccessfully tries to find her again in the nightclub. This {{was not part of the}} script, and was conceived and added to the episode about 10 minutes before the scene was shot. During one of the final scenes, when Ben informs Leslie and Ron that the Pawnee government will be shut down, Ron looks directly at the camera and makes a comical grin. Although Leslie is supposed to be horrified by the news, the scene had to be re-shot many times because she kept laughing at Ron's facial expression.|$|E
500|$|Lamont {{announced}} her resignation {{in an interview}} with the Daily Record on 24 October 2014, saying that it was her intention to step down immediately. She told the newspaper that she was resigning because Labour's Westminster leadership had undermined her attempts to reform the party in Scotland, and had treated Scottish Labour [...] "like a branch office of London". In her letter of resignation, submitted to Scottish Labour Party Chairman Jamie Glackin, Lamont accused [...] "senior members of the party" [...] of questioning her role and said that she was taking herself [...] "out of the equation" [...] to allow Scottish Labour to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> about the best way forward. Anas Sarwar became Labour's acting leader. On 26 October, following a meeting of the party's executive committee, he outlined the details of the leadership election. It was confirmed the next day that Jackie Baillie would represent Labour in the Scottish Parliament at the following session of First Minister's Questions.|$|E

500|$|Several {{scenes were}} created due to onset {{accidents}} and ad-libbing. In the cold opening, Dwight tries to impress Jim with his recently purchased [...] "fitness orb". Initially dismissive, Jim pops the ball after Dwight becomes increasingly obnoxious and troublesome. Before filming, the scene had been successfully rehearsed [...] "about ten times"; each time, when Krasinski punctured the plastic, the ball slowly deflated. However, {{when it came}} time to film the scene, Krasinski accidentally hit the ball [...] "right on the seam", resulting in Wilson quickly—and dramatically—hitting the carpet. In fact, several of the cast members in the background can be seen laughing, due to the unexpected nature of the shot. Initially, the cut was relegated to the blooper reel, but Wilmore pleaded with Daniels to include it in the finished episode. The [...] "accidental boob grab" [...] scene was based on a mistake made by Carell during a rehearsal. Originally, he was supposed to pat Hardin's shoulder. Instead, however, he accidentally brushed past her breast. Hardin, finding the accident [...] "hilarious", demanded that Carell do it during the actual shooting. Furthermore, several of the scenes were improvised beyond the initial lines given to Steve Carell and Melora Hardin, such as the ending wherein Michael and Jan <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> about Michael's flaws. Wilson recounts that he had to sit at his desk for [...] "an hour and a half" [...] due to the ad libbing.|$|E
500|$|Lamont's {{resignation}} as Labour {{leader was}} reported by media outlets {{on the evening of}} 24 October 2014, following the publication of an interview with the Daily Record in which she announced her intention to step down with immediate effect. She told the newspaper that she was resigning because Labour's Westminster leadership had undermined her attempts to reform the party in Scotland, and treated Scottish Labour “like a branch office of London.”. She described some London-based colleagues as [...] "dinosaurs" [...] unable to understand that [...] "Scotland has changed forever" [...] following the referendum. Lamont was also angry that she had not been consulted on some matters, such as a decision by the UK leadership to replace Ian Price as Scottish Labour's General Secretary. In her letter of resignation, submitted to Scottish Labour Party Chairman Jamie Glackin, Lamont accused [...] "senior members of the party" [...] of questioning her role and said that she was taking herself [...] "out of the equation" [...] to allow Scottish Labour to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> about the best way forward. Anas Sarwar became Labour's acting leader. On 26 October, following a meeting of the party's executive committee, he outlined the details of a leadership election, which would be held using the three-tier electoral college, and conclude with the announcement of a new leader on 13 December. Murphy, Boyack and Neil Findlay stood in the subsequent contest, with Murphy elected as Lamont's successor. Lamont did not vote for Murphy in the election, but instead chose to back his rivals.|$|E
500|$|Michael G. Wilson {{decided on}} the film's title Quantum of Solace only [...] "a few days" [...] before its {{announcement}} on 24 January 2008. It {{was the name of}} a short story in Ian Fleming's anthology For Your Eyes Only (1960). The film is related to the title in one of its thematic elements: [...] "when the 'Quantum of Solace' drops to zero, humanity and consideration of one human for another is gone." [...] Daniel Craig admitted, [...] "I was unsure at first. Bond is looking for his quantum of solace and that's what he wants, he wants his closure. Ian Fleming says that if you don't have a quantum of solace in your relationship then the relationship is over. It's that spark of niceness in a relationship that if you don't have you might as well give up." [...] He said that [...] "Bond doesn't have that because his girlfriend [...] has been killed," [...] and therefore, [...] " [...] looking for revenge... to make himself happy with the world again." [...] Afterwards, Quantum was made the name of the organisation introduced in Casino Royale. Craig noted the letter Q itself looks rather odd. Near the end of the film, the Camille Montes character and Bond <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> about their individual quests to avenge the deaths of their loved ones. Montes asks Bond to [...] "let me know what it feels like" [...] when he succeeds, the implication of the title being {{that it will be a}} small amount of solace compared to his despair. Bond's lack of emotion when he does exact revenge shows this to be the case.|$|E

[...] Brady said on the Senate floor [...] "The {{majority}} party is playing musical chairs with statewide offices in this state. [...] We {{have to have some}} type of process." [...] The Beacon-Journal was also skeptical of [...] "the latest round of musical chairs among Republican officeholders in Columbus." [...] Nevertheless, the General Assembly passed House Joint Resolution 1, which confirmed Johnson, on January 4, 2005, by 97–0 in the House and 22-11 in the Senate. Taft told the crowd at the swearing on January 5, [...] "Bruce has been actively engaged in designing our program for jobs creation, tax reform and economic development.

Crowe told the magazine that {{it was the first time}} he had ever heard of al-Qaeda and was quoted as saying: [...] "You get this late-night call from the FBI when you arrive in Los Angeles, and they're, like, absolutely full-on. 'We've got to talk to you now before you do anything. We have to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> with you, Mr. Crowe.'"

2500|$|Henry Rollins, in {{his journal}} {{collection}} Get in the Van, notes that Pettibon's artwork became synonymous with Black Flag and that before Rollins joined the band he would collect photocopies of their flyers that had circulated from California to Washington, D.C. The album cover for Nervous Breakdown had a particularly strong impact on Rollins: [...] "The record's cover art said it all. A man {{with his back to}} the wall baring his fists. In front of him another man fending him off with a chair. I felt like the guy with his fists up every day of my life." [...] Another image which drew considerable attention was the artwork created for the [...] "Police Story" [...] single, showing a police officer being held with a gun in his mouth with the speech blurb [...] "Make me come, faggot!" [...] The image was plastered on flyers all around Los Angeles and added to the police pressure on the band. Pettibon later remarked that [...] "my values are relativistic, and I'll give a cop the benefit of the doubt. If that's me with my gat – my gat's larger than the one depicted – we can <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion,</b> and he can answer me just as well with my [...]357 barrel in his mouth, or on his cheek, or on his adenoids, or down his throat.
