5|$|Although {{there are}} many diverse pathogens, {{many of which are}} {{constantly}} mutating, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> that a majority of individuals remain free of infections. Thus, maintenance of health requires the body to recognize all pathogens (antigens they present or produce) likely to exist. This is achieved by maintaining a pool of immensely large (about 109) clones of B cells, each of which reacts against a specific epitope by recognizing and producing antibodies against it. However, at any given time very few clones actually remain receptive to their specific epitope. Thus, approximately 107 different epitopes can be recognized by all the B cell clones combined. Moreover, in a lifetime, an individual usually requires the generation of antibodies against very few antigens in comparison with the number that the body can recognize and respond against.|$|E

When {{everyone}} in the office finds out, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) worries that Michael will discover the party he is throwing that night, to which Michael is not invited. Inevitably, Michael notices and tries to get Jim to admit that he's having a party, while Jim acts nonchalantly as if nothing is happening. In order to keep Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) from exposing the party, Jim tells him that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> party for Michael.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{was also}} known {{for his work on}} the {{consumption}} function, the permanent income hypothesis (1957), which Friedman himself referred to as his best scientific work. This work contended that rational consumers would spend a proportional amount of what they perceived to be their permanent income. Windfall gains would mostly be saved. Tax reductions likewise, as rational consumers would predict that taxes would have to increase later to balance public finances. Other important contributions include his critique of the Phillips curve and the concept of the natural rate of unemployment (1968). This critique associated his name, together with that of Edmund Phelps, with the insight that a government that brings about greater inflation cannot permanently reduce unemployment by doing so. Unemployment may be temporarily lower, if the inflation <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise,</b> {{but in the long run}} unemployment will be determined by the frictions and imperfections of the labor market.|$|E

Wong spoke about how the character of Catherine Black changed, saying [...] "there's a different relationship between Frank and his family this season because of the separation ... I think that will not only bring some kind of heartfelt drama but humor into it". Wong also stated [...] "we don't want to have the audience expect to see a serial killer every week. ...

A reviewer from the publication The Backlot listed the song at number eleven on their [...] "Kylie Minogue's Best Songs, In Honor of Her Birthday" [...] and said [...] "This stylistic mishmash (featuring a deep Celtic sound that, maybe, Alison Krauss could fiddle along with) is a hard-driving, adrenalized, sexualized quest for freedom. How {{do you deal with}} the fact that Kylie sings, [...] "I am frightened, I'm aroused, I'm enlightened to the now' and totally sells it?" [...] Online critic Adrian Denning from his website Adriandenning.co.uk said [...] "Too Far flows well into the impressive, eastern flavored Cowboy Style. Either one of these two songs would have made better singles than the ones eventually chosen, by the way." [...] Sputnikmusic highlighted the track as an album stand out, commenting [...] "Cowboy Style a funky western jam that might possibly get country fans to do a line dance, this is the mother to Madonna's [...] "Don't Tell Me". Kylie's creativity to mix her style with a genre that can be a put off to the masses <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> and one of the albums highlights." [...] "Cowboy Style" [...] entered at thirty-nine on 18 October 1998. It is the lowest charting single from the Impossible Princess album.|$|E

500|$|Mendelson {{called the}} trailer [...] "a {{textbook}} case for unnecessary second pitches...Is there anyone {{out there who}} watched that first teaser back in December and said 'Hmm, it looks good and all, but I need more evidence'?" [...] He added that he was [...] "a little disappointed by the big Spider-Man reveal," [...] having previously wondered, after a Spider-Man character poster was not released with the others, if Marvel would have the [...] "courage" [...] to not include the character in any marketing materials before the film's release, letting the [...] "Peter Parker scenes the film has to offer be something that <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> for theatrical moviegoers and/or something that drives post-opening weekend buzz". Mendelson's colleague at Forbes Mark Hughes felt differently, noting that the trailer was targeting the general audience rather than just fans by giving [...] "us more explanation [...] of why a clearly major battle is raging between Captain America and Iron Man", and by including Spider-Man since [...] "there are plenty of surprises in these movies, and since we all already know Spider-Man is in Civil War, refusing to let us see him would frankly be a bit weird and pointless ... it's common for average filmgoers to hear some final bit of information or see some final image and feel compelled, inspired, or otherwise driven {{to go out to}} the movies that day. There are any number of factors that can come into play...and the world needed to see [...] because itâ€™s the sort of value-added element that can make [...] difference". Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter felt that the Spider-Man reveal [...] "alone makes the trailer", describing it as feeling [...] "like the comic book character come to life. That awkward, voice-cracking, 'hey everyone' was as humble, playing-it-cool and cocky as he should be." ...|$|E
500|$|Janet Maslin of The New York Times {{praised the}} film with the {{following}} statement, [...] "Two years ago, Walt Disney Pictures reinvented the animated feature, not only {{with an eye toward}} pleasing children, but also with an older, savvier audience in mind. Disney truly bridged a generation gap with The Little Mermaid... Now, lightning has definitely struck twice with Beauty and the Beast." [...] Awarding the film a perfect score of four stars, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times compared Beauty and the Beast positively to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Pinocchio, writing, [...] "Beauty and the Beast reaches back to an older and healthier Hollywood tradition in which the best writers, musicians and filmmakers are gathered for a project on the assumption that a family audience deserves great entertainment, too." [...] In 2001 Ebert again gave the IMAX re-release a full 4 out of 4 stars. James Berardinelli of ReelViews rated the film similarly while hailing it as [...] "the finest animated movie ever made", writing, [...] "Beauty and the Beast attains a nearly-perfect mix of romance, music, invention, and animation." [...] The use of computer animation, particularly in the ballroom sequence, was singled out in several reviews as one of the film's highlights. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review, calling the film [...] "A delightfully satisfying modern fable, a near-masterpiece that draws on the sublime traditions of the past while remaining completely in sync with the sensibility of its time." [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise,</b> in a time of sequels and retreads, that the new film is so fresh and altogether triumphant in its own right." [...] Dave Kehr of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "Beauty and the Beast is certainly adequate holiday entertainment for children and their more indulgent parents..... But the film has little of the technical facility, vivid characterization and emotional impact of Disney past." ...|$|E

2500|$|Foy {{appears in}} her feature-film debut {{as the girl}} {{who is accused of}} being a witch. Known for her titular role in the British miniseries Little Dorrit, she met Sena and sought the role in Season of the Witch. She {{explained}} the choice, [...] "It's quite a manipulative role; the character does a lot of manipulating. Pitting other people against each other, being quite mischievous... That was something I thought would obviously be good to do." [...] Foy researched witchcraft and demonic possession for the role. She described its appeal, [...] "Playing a character that was making things happen, and mainly in control of an entire group of men. And for once, be the character that is completely in the know about everything. There is nothing that she doesn't know. Nothing <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise.</b> And she is able to deal with every single situation that arises the way that she sees fit. And I think that was quite refreshing {{to be able to play}} a character that wasn't entirely beholden to everyone else." ...|$|E
