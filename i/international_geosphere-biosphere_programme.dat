40|$|AbstractThe {{maturing}} of Earth system {{science as}} a discipline has underpinned the development of concepts such as the Anthropocene and planetary boundaries. The <b>International</b> <b>Geosphere–Biosphere</b> <b>Programme’s</b> (IGBP) scientific and institutional history is deeply intertwined {{with the development of}} the concept of the Earth as a system as well as the discipline of Earth system science. Here we frame the broader programme of IGBP through its core projects and programme-level activities and illustrate this co-evolution. We identify and discuss three phases in the programme’s history. In its first phase beginning in 1986, IGBP focused on building international networks and global databases that were key to understanding Earth system component processes. In the early 2000 s IGBP’s first major synthesis and associated activities promoted a more integrated view of the Earth system informed by greater emphasis on interdisciplinarity. Human actions were seen {{as an integral part of}} the Earth system and the concept of the Anthropocene came to the fore. In recent years IGBP has increased focus on sustainability and multifaceted engagement with policy processes. IGBP closed at the end of 2015 after three decades of coordinating international research on global change. The programme’s longevity points to its capacity to adapt its scientific and institutional structures to changing scientific and societal realities. Its history may offer lessons for the emerging Future Earth initiative as it seeks to rally international collaborative research around sustainability and solutions...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of {{nitrous oxide}} in air samples from 48 {{sites in the}} Cooperative Global Air Sampling Network made by NOAA/ESRL GMD CCGG (the Carbon Cycle Greenhouse Gases group in the Global Monitoring Division at the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado) and the {{three-dimensional}} chemical transport model TM 3 were used to infer global nitrous oxide fluxes and their uncertainties from 1998 - 2001. Results are presented for four semihemispherical regions (90 °S- 30 °S, 30 °S to equator, equator to 30 °N, 30 °N- 90 °N) and six broad "super regions" (Southern Land, Southern Oceans, Tropical Land, Tropical Oceans, Northern Land, and Northern Oceans). We found that compared to our a priori estimate (from the <b>International</b> <b>Geosphere-Biosphere</b> <b>Programme's</b> Global Emissions Inventory Activity), the a posteriori flux was much lower from 90 °S- 30 °S and substantially higher from equator to 30 °N. Consistent with these results, the a posteriori flux from the Southern Oceans region was lower than the a priori estimate, while Tropical Land and Tropical Ocean estimates were higher. The ratio of Northern Hemisphere to Southern Hemisphere fluxes was found to range from 1. 9 to 5. 2 (depending on the model setup), which {{is higher than the}} a priori ratio (1. 5) and at the high end of previous estimates. Globally, ocean emissions contributed 26 - 36 % of the total flux (again depending on the model setup), consistent with the a priori estimate (29 %), though somewhat higher than some other previous estimates...|$|R

40|$|In this Working Paper, {{the authors}} produce maps of IWR, {{an index of}} water {{exchange}} variability proposed by the National Environment and Climate Monitoring Laboratory, Moscow. Values of the index are computed from measurements of monthly precipitation and estimates of monthly evapo-transpiration obtained from {{a large number of}} heat budget stations in the Soviet Union. Values of IWR correspond remarkably with ecosystem types, the isopleths being closely packed along ecotones (separating forest and taiga, for example). Given some future climate scenario, the method could be used to estimate changes in the locations of ecotones. Thus the paper is a contribution to the ICSU IGBP program (<b>International</b> <b>Geosphere-Biosphere</b> Program) and as such, is to be welcomed...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT- he aim of {{this paper}} is to {{emphasize}} some of the studies of Jean-Charles Fontes and his role in Our scientific community. Isotopes represent a powerful tool for the understanding of the Earth's past environment and defining the envelope of natural environmental variability within which we can assess anthropogenic impact on the Earth's biosphere, geosphere and atmosphere. The reconstruction impacts of past climatic change on the Earth's system are a basis to validate models of the possible impacts of future climate change. Oceanic sediments, polar ice caps, continental sedi-mentary sequences and groundwater are archives of past climate. Their quan-titative study is developed within the IGBP (<b>International</b> <b>Geosphere-Biosphere</b> Program) - Pages project, which strongly emphasizes an optimum use of isotope tools...|$|R

40|$|The Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) is {{a program}} {{initiated}} by the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) to observe, understand and model the hydrological cycle and the related energy fluxes in the atmosphere, at the land surface and in the upper oceans.
