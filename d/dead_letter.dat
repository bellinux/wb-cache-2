Horn's mental condition seems to deteriorate, and he begins to take the case personally, leading Black to doubt his ability.|$|E

25|$|A {{little known}} force that never saw combat were the Auxiliary Units, a {{specially}} trained and secret organisation that, {{in the event}} of an invasion, would provide resistance behind the lines. Auxiliary Units were well equipped and supplied with food for 14 days, which was their expected lifespan. Selected for aptitude and local knowledge, men were mostly recruited from the Home Guard, which also provided a cover for their existence. In addition, the Special Duties Section was recruited to provide an intelligence gathering service, spying on enemy formations and troop movements. Reports were to be collected from <b>dead</b> <b>letter</b> drops and relayed by radio operators of the Royal Signals from secret locations.|$|E

Meanwhile the missions of the diocese had been greatly weakened by secessions to the vicars Apostolic. The missions were situated in British territory and as beyond the clergy there were scarcely any Portuguese subjects to be found throughout the diocese there was no particular inducement or the people to cling to the see.|$|E
25|$|Tibet under Qing rule {{refers to}} the Qing dynasty's rule over Tibet from 1720 to 1912. During the Qing rule of Tibet, the region was structurally, militarily and {{administratively}} controlled by the Qing dynasty established by the Manchus in China. In the history of Tibet, Qing administrative rule was established after a Qing army defeated the Dzungars who occupied Tibet in 1720, and lasted until {{the fall of the}} Qing dynasty in 1912, although the region retained a degree of political autonomy under the Dalai Lamas. The Qing emperors appointed imperial residents known as the Ambans to Tibet, who commanded over 2,000 troops stationed in Lhasa and reported to the Lifan Yuan, a Qing government agency that oversaw the empire's frontier regions. The protectorate that China had established over Tibet in the 18th century remained into the 20th century, but by the late 19th century Chinese hegemony over Tibet remained in theory but in actuality was a <b>dead</b> <b>letter</b> given the weight of China's domestic and foreign-relations burdens. However, the Chinese began to take steps to reassert their authority shortly after the British expedition to Tibet.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Dead</b> <b>Letters</b> is {{the fifth}} album by Finnish {{alternative}} rock band The Rasmus released in 2003. It was released later in 2004 in the US, UK and Australia.

The album received 8 Gold and 6 Platinum music certification awards.

25|$|In 1864 Sturman married Emma Jessup (or Webb) (1846–1918) {{when he was}} 23 and she was 18 years old. They {{had nine}} children, of whom one died young. By 1871 Sturman was aged 30, still a {{schoolmaster}} and married to Emma aged 25, a schoolmistress born in Hackney, Whitechapel, Stepney or Mile End. They had two children aged six and five years, and were living at 145 Packington Street, then a ladies' school, at St Peter's, Islington. By 1881 there were eight children aged two to sixteen, of which the eldest was a civil servant clerk, and Sturman was still schoolmastering, although they had {{moved out of the}} school and were living at 68 Upper Tollington Park, Hornsey. They had moved around somewhat, as the three youngest of the children had been born in Penge, Sydenham, and Lee Place in Lewisham. By 1891 the family had two servants, and most of them (less two children) were living at 160 Holland Road, South Kensington. Sturman was now Hon. Secretary of the Society and Emma was Lady Secretary. Their daughter Florence was a <b>dead</b> <b>letter</b> office clerk - a post which might have been useful at a Society which practised a form of pamphleting and received a great deal of returned mail. The other children were all clerks, except the youngest who was an apprentice electrical engineer. In 1899, Sturman died.|$|E

500|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions were}} difficult for lead singer Michael Stipe, who, among the band, was particularly worn {{out by the}} band's 1983 tour schedule.

While recording the song [...] "7 Chinese Brothers", Stipe sang so quietly that Dixon could not hear him on the tape. Frustrated, the producer climbed a ladder to a spot above the recording booth Stipe was in and found a gospel record titled The Joy of Knowing Jesus by the Revelaires, which he then handed to the singer in an attempt to inspire him. Stipe began reciting the liner notes from the album audibly, which enabled Dixon to move on to recording the vocal track to [...] "7 Chinese Brothers" [...] properly (the initial recitation take was later released in 1987 as [...] "Voice of Harold" [...] on the compilation <b>Dead</b> <b>Letter</b> Office).|$|E

She was born in Russia and had been stranded by the Russian Revolution of 1917 with her sister at a finishing school in Geneva. In 1919, Szigeti and Ostrowska decided to get married, but due to the turbulent political situation in Europe, many unexpected bureaucratic obstacles were thrown up in their path. The first problem was the impossibility of contacting Ostrowska's family, and the couple were forced to go ahead without parental consent, with the permission only of Ostrowska's sister and the headmistress of the finishing school. Further bureaucratic entanglements threatened the young couple's hopes, but eventually the officials responsible granted them a dispensation to marry. Szigeti recalls in his memoirs the words of Consul General Baron de Montlong at the critical moment: Let us not, if we can avoid it, fall victim to the <b>dead</b> <b>letter</b> of the law.

500|$|When Louis IX {{made his}} {{decision}} on 23 January 1264, {{it was entirely}} in favour of Henry III. The settlement starts out by reiterating the declarations of the two parties, where they place the decision fully {{in the hands of}} the French king. Louis invoked the difficulties England had suffered over the previous years, and stressed the importance of a resolution. Since the pope had already invalidated the provisions, Louis decided to [...] "...quash and invalidate all these provisions, ordinances, and obligations, or whatever else they may be called...", and absolved the king from any adherence to them. Castles that were handed over to the barons as part of the agreement were to be given back to the king, and Henry should be free to appoint his own ministers. The only concession made to the barons was a general pardon extended to those involved in the conflict. The financial demands of King Henry were not mentioned. Louis was a firm believer in the royal prerogative, and was never likely to embrace the precedents set by the barons' infringement of Henry's authority. There was also the papal annulment to take into account, which the deeply pious Louis was not going to ignore. At the same time, Henry's wife Eleanor of Provencewho was Louis' sister-in-lawhad worked hard to procure a favourable decision for her husband. It was clear from the start though, that the French king had gone too far in his partisan decision, and that the settlement was little more than a <b>dead</b> <b>letter.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Act {{required}} magistrates {{to appoint}} visitors, whom it empowered to inspect mills and report on their findings, {{but it did}} not require them to exercise their powers. Consequently, unless local magistrates were particularly interested in the issue, the Act was poorly enforced. Where factories were inspected, the visitors were amateurs (as indeed they were) in comparison to the paid Factory Inspectorate set up by the 1833 Act. Furthermore, the Act applied only to apprentices, and not to 'free children' whose fathers' right to dispose of their children's labour on whatever terms they chose were unaffected by the Act. [...] Improvements in the generation of rotary motion by steam engines made steam-powered cotton mills a practical proposition; they were already operating in Manchester in 1795, using free children drawn from the local population. [...] The great advantage parish apprentices had had was that they were tied to the mill, no matter how remote the mill had to be to avail itself of water power. [...] If the mill no longer had to be remote, it became a problem that the mill was tied to the apprentices. [...] Apprentices had to be housed clothed and fed whether or not the mill could sell what they produced; they were in competition with free children whose wages would fall if the mill went on short time (and might not reflect the full cost of housing clothing and feeding them, since that was incurred whether they were working or not) and who could be discharged if sick, injured or otherwise incapable of work. [...] Consequently, the use of free children came to predominate: the Act became largely a <b>dead</b> <b>letter</b> within its limited scope, and inapplicable to most factory children.|$|E
