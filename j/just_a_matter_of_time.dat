This {{awareness}} is not <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> spent with lasers; to the contrary, long-term dealing with invisible risks (such as from infrared laser beams) tends to reduce risk awareness primarily due to complacency, rather than to sharpen it.|$|E

Publius Cornelius Scipio had taken advantage of Hasdrubal’s departure and broke the Carthaginian power on the Iberian peninsula {{as a result of}} the battle at Ilipa. The final victory was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

I did Dead Snow, then Hansel & Gretel, and then [...] I want to do something a little bit different now and not just do sequels. I did write the script and I hope to be involved in it. But yeah, I won’t be directing it.” He said [...] "the first film was a learning curve for me working in the studio system and the script I wrote for the original was so different [...] We ended up taking a lot out and altering stuff that first time. I tried taking what I learned and still delivered a sequel script that’s an R-rated action film." [...] Cinema Blend reported Renner said that despite his busy schedule he agreed to reprise the role of Hansel because the first film [...] "was a lot of fun doing the movie," [...] but without Wirkola directing again he might be less likely to return for the sequel.|$|E

[...] The second stated [...] "'Jeremy Deller presents '1997 What The Fuck's Going On'", a reference to The JAMs' debut album 1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?). [...] It continued, [...] "Jimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond invite you to a 23 minute performance during which the next 840 days of our lives will be discussed".

[...] Johnson in turn only reported that the investigation was ongoing and refused to provide additional details to the public.

2500|$|Sam Kellerman was 29 years old. In {{speaking}} about his brother, Max Kellerman recalls that [...] " [...] was a creative genius... He {{was the best}} writer for his age I've ever read. I used to tell him, 'I'll {{always be able to}} get someone to pay me for talking, and you'll always be able to get someone to pay you for writing.' When it came to writing, I felt like Salieri to Sam's Mozart. Sam wanted to direct film, but I think he was fated to write and be in front of the camera. He was starting to get work as an actor.

2500|$|Vice Admiral William P. Mack {{recalled}} {{the antics of}} the diminutive vice chief: [...] "He would grab three-star officers by the lapels, literally shake them, and say, 'Why don't you do so and so or such and such?' They'd be thirty or forty pounds heavier than he was, but that didn't bother him at all. He was there for two years, which was probably about a year too long, because morale was getting pretty low. As I told Admiral Burke, it was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> before {{someone was going to}} slug him. You can't operate like that. Admiral Felt wasn't big enough to defend himself. I said that one of these days he's going to come at someone who's going to wipe up the corridor with him, regardless of how many stars he has." ...|$|E
2500|$|The battle {{caused a}} rise in anti-war {{sentiment}} in the Northern states. Grant {{became known as the}} [...] "fumbling butcher" [...] for his poor decisions. It also lowered the morale of his remaining troops. But the campaign had served Grant's purpose—as ill-advised as his attack on Cold Harbor was, Lee had lost the initiative and was forced to devote his attention to the defense of Richmond and Petersburg. He beat Grant to Petersburg, barely, but spent the remainder of the war (save its final week) defending Richmond behind a fortified trench line. Although Southerners realized their situation was desperate, they hoped that Lee's stubborn (and bloody) resistance would have political repercussions by causing Abraham Lincoln to lose the 1864 presidential election to a more peace-friendly candidate. The taking of Atlanta in September dashed these hopes, {{and the end of the}} Confederacy was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

Soon Hulda was elected secretary of the Indianapolis chapter. Her program material had to be approved by “W.A.M.” in Milwaukee, who became as smitten with her writing as she was with his. It was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> before the handsome twenty-seven-year-old national secretary met the secretary of the Indianapolis chapter; a slender brunette with expressive brown eyes and sparkling smile who was destined to become his bride. [...] Married in 1924, they eventually had two sons: Walter A. Maier II, born in 1925; and Paul L. Maier, born in 1929. Maier continued in his capacity as editor of the Messenger through 1945.|$|E

2500|$|Both Kate Blanchard and Scholz {{note that}} there are several {{passages}} in the Book of Isaiah, Book of Jeremiah, and Book of Ezekiel that utilize rape metaphors. Blanchard expressed outrage over this fact, writing [...] "The translations of these shining examples of victim-blaming are clear enough, despite the old-fashioned language: I'm angry and you're going to suffer for it. You deserve to be raped because of your sexual exploits. You're a slut and it was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> till you suffered the consequences. Let this be a lesson {{to you and to}} all other uppity women." [...] Scholz discussed four passages—Isaiah 3:16-17, Jeremiah 13:22 and 26, Ezekiel 16, and Ezekiel 23. On Isaiah, Scholz wrote that there is a common mistranslation of the Hebrew word pōt as [...] "forehead" [...] or [...] "scalp". Also often translated as [...] "genitals", Scholz believes that a more accurate translation of the word in context is [...] "cunt". Regarding Jeremiah, Scholz wrote, [...] "The poem proclaims that the woman brought this fate upon herself and she is to be blamed for it, while the prophet sides with the sexually violent perpetrators, viewing the attack as deserved and God as justifying it. Rape poetics endorses 'masculine authoritarianism' and the 'dehumanization of women,' perhaps especially when the subject is God." ...|$|E
