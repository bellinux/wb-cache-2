5|$|In 2004, {{construction}} {{began on}} a 60-home upscale development called Arlington Heights, and {{a grant from}} the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development allowed for the demolition of Westlake Terrace, a sprawling and dilapidated public housing project. Today, the site features a blend of senior housing, rental townhouses and for-sale single-family homes. Low real-estate prices and the efforts of the Youngstown Central Area Improvement Corporation (CIC) have contributed to the purchase of several long-abandoned downtown buildings (many by out-of-town investors) and their restoration and conversion into specialty shops, restaurants, and eventually condominiums. Further, a nonprofit organization called Wick Neighbors <b>is</b> <b>planning</b> <b>a</b> $250 million New Urbanist revitalization of Smoky Hollow, a former ethnic neighborhood that borders the downtown and university campus. The neighborhood will eventually comprise about 400 residential units, university student housing, retail space, and a central park. Construction for the project began in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Part of the {{battlefield}} is now preserved in Princeton Battlefield State Park, which was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961. Another section of {{the battlefield}} adjacent to the state park is embroiled in a development controversy. The Institute for Advanced Study, which owns the property, <b>is</b> <b>planning</b> <b>a</b> housing project on land where George Washington charged with his men during the battle. Historians, the Department of the Interior and archaeological evidence confirm the land's significance. Several national and local preservation organizations are working to prevent construction on the property, and the Princeton Battlefield Society had legal action pending as of summer 2016. On December 12, 2016, the Civil War Trust announced they will purchase almost 15 acres of land from the Institute for Advanced Study. Seven of the planned single family dwellings will be replaced with townhouses. In total, 16 housing units will be constructed. The compromise is subject to approval by the Princeton Planning Board and Delaware and Raritan Canal Commission.|$|E
5|$|The MTA also {{expressed}} interest in starting a pilot program to install platform edge doors. Several planned stations in the New York City Subway may possibly feature platform screen doors, possibly including future stations such as those part of the Second Avenue Subway. Currently, the MTA <b>is</b> <b>planning</b> <b>a</b> test program to install screen doors at a subway station on the BMT Canarsie Line. As part of the 2010–2014 capital program, the station {{was going to be}} Sixth Avenue, but it is uncertain whether or not that this will be the station chosen. Following a series of incidents during one week in November 2016, in which 3 people were injured or killed after being pushed onto the tracks, the MTA started to consider installing platform edge doors for the 42nd Street Shuttle.|$|E
