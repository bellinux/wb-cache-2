5|$|The {{first known}} SGD was prototyped in the mid-1970s, and rapid {{progress}} in {{hardware and software}} development <b>has</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> SGD capabilities can now be integrated into devices like smartphones. Notable users of SGDs include Stephen Hawking, Roger Ebert, Tony Proudfoot, and Pete Frates (founder of the ALS ice bucket challenge).|$|E
5|$|Changes {{in society}} and {{approaches}} towards education, including equal opportunities, <b>has</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> it is now recognised that all children deserve {{to have the same}} educational opportunities without singling out those who learn at a slower rate than others, thus every child has the opportunity to gain secondary school level qualifications or similar, regardless of background or intelligence.|$|E
5|$|Imaginative spectators {{would climb}} {{the church and}} watch a {{football}} game from the rooftop however they have now been deterred from doing so with the installation of security measures such as barbed wire and anti-climb paint. In addition, {{the introduction of the}} 'all-seater' ruling following the Taylor Report <b>has</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> spectators no longer resort to climbing nearby buildings for a glimpse of the event as a seat is guaranteed with a purchased ticket.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Troy {{took refuge}} in dumb diplomacy--he made a low bow. It might <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> he {{believed}} Isabel, or it might <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> he modestly withdrew his own opinion into the background. Lady Lydiard did not condescend to inquire what it meant.|$|R
50|$|The minimum {{property}} requirement would <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> some {{married women}} would be regarded differently than single women.|$|R
50|$|More recent {{distinctions between}} {{old and new}} media <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> metamedia becomes used to {{describe}} modernity and art more than systems.|$|R
5|$|In {{response}} to the ruling, some students created web-based publications not subsidized by the school. Some individual states have also responded with laws designating student newspapers as public forums and offering them greater First Amendment protection. Experts from the Student Press Law Center say the case <b>has</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> fewer lawsuits regarding student censorship make it to court.|$|E
5|$|In the United States and the European Union, {{since the}} early 1990s {{regulations}} {{have been in place}} that are designed to prevent shellfish from contaminated waters entering the food chain. This <b>has</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> there is sometimes a shortage of regulated shellfish, with consequent higher prices. This has led to illegal harvesting and sale of shellfish on the black market, which can be a health hazard.|$|E
5|$|Standing {{on top of}} a late Roman church, the cathedral, reconstructed in the 1970s and 1980s, {{follows a}} cross-domed plan with a bell tower and a triple apse. Richly {{decorated}} on both the exterior and interior, its internal walls now feature modern frescoes, the presence of which <b>has</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> it has not been reconsecrated. Though not active as a Christian place of worship, it has been open for visitors since 1985.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{building}} was originally built almost symmetrically in 1939, it has undergone various changes which <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> {{this is no longer}} the case.|$|R

50|$|Ivan Shcheblykin {{claimed that}} the tower {{builders}} did not need any scaffolding, and many researchers make that assumption. However, he may <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> they used no scaffolding on the outside.|$|R
5|$|Restaurants are {{promoting}} {{the quality of}} Welsh ingredients, encouraging people to purchase Welsh produce and creating new dishes using them. This <b>has</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> Welsh products can {{find their way into}} the higher-priced delicatessens of London or North America. However, the regular diet of Welsh people has been more influenced by India, China and America. The most popular dish is chicken tikka masala, followed by burgers or chow mein. As a result of the popularity of these sorts of foods, Wales has the highest fat consumption in Britain, and the highest levels of obesity.|$|E
5|$|The former {{popularity}} of the Barbary lion as a zoo animal <b>has</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> scattered lions in captivity {{are likely to be}} descended from Barbary lion stock. This includes lions at Port Lympne Wild Animal Park in Kent, England that are descended from animals owned by the King of Morocco. Another eleven animals believed to be Barbary lions were found in Addis Ababa zoo, descendants of animals owned by Emperor Haile Selassie. WildLink International, in collaboration with Oxford University, launched their ambitious International Barbary Lion Project with the aim of identifying and breeding Barbary lions in captivity for eventual reintroduction into a national park in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco.|$|E
5|$|The recent {{advent of}} {{artificial}} tissue culture, or more specifically in vitro, technology in Europe and the United States <b>has</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> plants {{can be produced}} in large numbers and sold at relatively low prices (~US$20–$30 {{in the case of}} N. rajah). In vitro propagation refers to production of whole plants from cell cultures derived from explants (generally seeds). This technology has, to a large extent, removed the incentive for collectors to travel to Sabah to collect the plant illegally, and demand for wild-collected plants has fallen considerably in recent years.|$|E
50|$|Central Station has {{gradually}} grown to include Les Halles de la Gare, a shopping and restaurant complex. Real estate pressures <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> the shopping area would be expanded several times.|$|R

50|$|Further {{developments}} in maternity clothing styles <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> many maternity tops are also made to enable discreet nursing, extending the usable life of maternity clothes beyond just the period whilst pregnant.|$|R
5|$|While Bembo Book is {{considered}} the superior digitisation, the original continues to offer the advantages of two extra weights (semi- and extra-bold) and infant styles with simplified a and g characters resembling handwriting; its lighter appearance may also be of use on printing equipment with greater ink spread. Cross-licensing <b>has</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> it is sold by a range of vendors, often at very low prices. As an example of this, Fontsite obtained the rights to resell a derivative of the original digitisation, using the alternative name Borgia and Bergamo, upgrading it by additional OpenType features such as small capitals and historical alternative characters. Neither version includes digitisations of the larger size versions of Bembo, which had a more delicate and elegant design.|$|E
5|$|Distributed element {{filters are}} mostly used at {{frequencies}} above the VHF (Very High Frequency) band (30 to 300 MHz). At these frequencies, the physical length of passive components {{is a significant}} fraction of the wavelength of the operating frequency, and it becomes difficult to use the conventional lumped element model. The exact point at which distributed element modelling becomes necessary depends on the particular design under consideration. A common {{rule of thumb is}} to apply distributed element modelling when component dimensions are larger than 0.1λ. The increasing miniaturisation of electronics <b>has</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> circuit designs are becoming ever smaller compared to λ. The frequencies beyond which a distributed element approach to filter design becomes necessary are becoming ever higher {{as a result of these}} advances. On the other hand, antenna structure dimensions are usually comparable to λ in all frequency bands and require the distributed element model.|$|E
5|$|The {{life-cycle}} of the phumdis {{has generally}} been subject to seasonal variation. During the monsoon season when the water level is high, the phumdis float, but during the dry season, as the water level falls, the phumdis touch the lake bed and absorb nutrients from it. When the wet season returns, they again float, and the biomass, which has enough nutrients stored in the plants' roots, survives. However, the contemporary situation, with high water levels in the lake throughout the year, <b>has</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> the process of 'feeding' on lakebottom nutrients has been seriously disturbed, resulting {{in a loss of}} biomass and a thinning of the islands each year. In January 1999, it was reported that a large section of phumdi in the north of the park had shattered into pieces and drifted away from the park area, threatening the habitat of the sangai.|$|E

50|$|Digital {{foundations}} to most {{storage and}} transmission systems {{since the early}} 1990s <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> analogue NTSC <b>has</b> only been expected to have 480 lines of picture - see SDTV, EDTV, and DVD-Video.|$|R
5|$|The 1993–94 UEFA Champions League saw Linfield {{drawn with}} Dynamo Tbilisi of Georgia. After losing 3–2 on aggregate, they were {{reinstated}} when their opponents were {{expelled from the}} competition for alleged match fixing and paying the officials. Linfield faced Copenhagen {{in the first round}} proper. They won the first leg 3–0, but lost the second leg 4–0 after extra time. This proved costly, as victory would have meant a financially lucrative tie against eventual champions A.C. Milan in the next round. The club then had to wait seven years to participate in the competition again, due to the format of the two European competitions being altered. The league's relatively low ranking in the UEFA coefficient system <b>has</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> the club has entered in the early qualifying rounds of either the UEFA Champions League or the UEFA Cup/Europa League, with the second qualifying round being the furthest the club has progressed in either competition. In the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League, the Blues entered the competition in the first qualifying round, and defeated B36 Tórshavn 4–3 on penalties to progress to the second qualifying round, after both legs ended as 0–0 draws. This was {{the first time since the}} 1984–85 season (excluding their opponent's expulsion in 1993–94) that the club had won a tie in the competition. However, they were defeated 3–0 on aggregate in the next round by AEL Limassol.|$|E

50|$|While and Matthews customarily hold {{an annual}} festival 'Party on the Lawn' {{which takes place}} at:Prebendal Farm, Bishopstone, Wiltshire in June, however, other {{commitments}} in 2009 <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> it <b>has</b> not taken place.|$|R
25|$|The factory {{was secured}} after {{production}} ceased, and recently Rimmer Brothers acquired the entire stock of unused parts for resale in the UK. This <b>has</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> {{a number of}} parts which had not been available for some time can now be bought new.|$|E
25|$|The {{legacy of}} the Army <b>has</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> the land for leisure use, as well as {{protected}} areas for flora and fauna, has been preserved over many years. On the Surrey border can be found Rowhill Nature Reserve which is popular with nature-lovers, walkers and joggers.|$|E
25|$|Another {{condition}} {{has come}} to be known as autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED). It is characterized by idiopathic, rapidly progressive, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. It is a fairly rare disorder while at the same time, a lack of proper diagnostic testing <b>has</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> its precise incidence cannot be determined.|$|E
50|$|This would <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> the NTSC {{sound carrier}} {{frequency}} of 4.5 MHz above the picture carrier, would have also been the standard for Europe, and hence been a lot more common world wide.|$|R
50|$|Some early written poetry {{appears to}} contain these, {{but in many}} cases the words used rhymed at the time of writing, and {{subsequent}} changes in pronunciation <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> the rhyme is now lost.|$|R
25|$|That daily tides {{should be}} caused by full moons and new moons is manifestly wrong, {{which would be a}} {{surprising}} view in a Greek astronomer and mathematician of the times. He could <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> spring and neap tides were caused by new and full moons, which is partially correct in that spring tides occur at those times. A gravitational theory (objects fall to the center) existed at the time but Pytheas appears to <b>have</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> the phases themselves were the causes (αἰτίαι aitiai). However imperfect or imperfectly related the viewpoint, Pytheas was the first to associate the tides to the phases of the moon.|$|R
