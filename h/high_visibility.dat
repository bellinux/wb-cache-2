5|$|A {{portion of}} the Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 58 is on Nescopeck Mountain. Additionally, the Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 187 contain the Nescopeck Mountain Barrens. The ridge is on the {{northern}} border of the 3550-acre Nescopeck State Park. Historically, there were trails {{leading up to the}} top of Nescopeck Mountain.

5|$|Other {{buildings}} {{constructed by}} David Balfour include the Dishan Tower, {{known locally as}} The Douche. This is a saltwater shower building with a dovecote on top. A local landmark due to its <b>high</b> <b>visibility</b> when approaching the island by sea, the building {{is now in a}} serious state of disrepair, with roofing slates missing and the dovecote in danger of collapsing.|$|E

5|$|McCarthy {{established}} {{a bond with}} the powerful Kennedy family, which had <b>high</b> <b>visibility</b> among Catholics. McCarthy became {{a close friend of}} Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., himself a fervent anti-Communist, and was a frequent guest at the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port. He dated two of Kennedy's daughters, Patricia and Eunice. It has been stated that McCarthy was godfather to Robert F. Kennedy's first child, Kathleen Kennedy. This claim has been acknowledged by Robert's wife and Kathleen's mother Ethel, though Kathleen later claimed that she looked at her christening certificate and that her actual godfather was Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart professor Daniel Walsh.|$|E
5|$|The {{large size}} and weight would have {{rendered}} the tank unable to cross bridges {{at the risk of}} collapsing them, and travelling on roads would soon destroy them. Though its top intended speed was 40kilometres per hour, its huge size and <b>high</b> <b>visibility</b> would have made it extremely vulnerable to aerial bombardment and artillery fire. Its great size would also have made it nearly impossible to transport—no existing railway or train car could bear its weight and its width was too great for existing tunnels.|$|E
5|$|Green can {{communicate}} safety to proceed, as in traffic lights. Green and red were standardized as {{the colors of}} international railroad signals in the 19th century. The first traffic light, using green and red gas lamps, was erected in 1868 {{in front of the}} Houses of Parliament in London. It exploded the following year, injuring the policeman who operated it. In 1912, the first modern electric traffic lights were put up in Salt Lake City, Utah. Red was chosen largely because of its <b>high</b> <b>visibility,</b> and its association with danger, while green was chosen largely because it could not be mistaken for red. Today green lights universally signal that a system is turned on and working as it should. In many video games, green signifies both health and completed objectives, opposite red.|$|E

5|$|From his {{headquarters}} in Tampa, Schwarzkopf began planning the operations to defend Saudi Arabia. Lieutenant General Charles Horner, USAF, ran the headquarters in Riyadh. Schwarzkopf planned supply lines for the 50,000 troops initially sent to Saudi Arabia, tapping Major General William G. Pagonis {{as director of}} the logistical operations, with U.S. Air Force cargo aircraft landing supplies at Dhahran and U.S. Navy ships offloading troops and supplies at Dammam. By August 20, 20,000 U.S. troops were in Saudi Arabia, with another 80,000 preparing to deploy, and a further 40,000 reserves tapped to augment them. Schwarzkopf arrived at the CENTCOM command in Riyadh on August 25, and on August 29 he conducted his first front-line tour of the potential combat zone, accompanied by reporters. Over the next several weeks, Schwarzkopf spoke frequently with both reporters and troops under his command, conducting many high-profile press conferences and updates to the situation in Saudi Arabia. Schwarzkopf worked to help coordinate the contributions of the different nations contributing military forces to the effort. By mid-October, Schwarzkopf indicated he was confident the forces were of a sufficient level that they could defend Saudi Arabia if it was attacked. Through October, Schwarzkopf and his command were occupied with setting up facilities and supply lines for the troops streaming into Saudi Arabia. He also worked to minimize the culture clash among foreigners in sharia-dominated Saudi Arabia, such as the <b>high</b> <b>visibility</b> of women in military roles. Schwarzkopf remained at his command in Riyadh through December, making frequent frontline visits to the troops. On December 29, 1990, he received a warning order from The Pentagon to be ready to attack into Iraq and Kuwait by January 17.|$|E
