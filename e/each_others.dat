5|$|A genetic {{study in}} 2012 found clear {{differences}} between various {{populations of the}} Cuvier's dwarf caiman (Pantanal; Madeira River basin; Rio Negro basin) and these are apparently isolated from <b>each</b> <b>others,</b> leading to the suggestion {{that it may be}} a cryptic species complex.|$|E
5|$|For {{the size}} of limitanei units, opinion is divided. Jones and Elton suggest from the scarce and {{ambiguous}} literary evidence that border legiones numbered c. 1,000 men and that the other units contained {{in the region of}} 500 men <b>each.</b> <b>Others</b> draw on papyrus and more recent archaeological evidence to argue that limitanei units probably averaged about half the Jones/Elton strength i.e. c. 500 for legiones and around 250 for other units.|$|E
25|$|In Malays lore, Azazil was {{an angel}} in Jannah, who {{was turned into}} Jann after refusing to bow down before Adam and then begot the Jinn. They at first {{inhabited}} the lowest heaven but later descended to earth and fought against <b>each</b> <b>others</b> and become disobedient towards God.|$|E
50|$|For example, all circles {{are similar}} to <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> all squares {{are similar to}} <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> and all {{equilateral}} triangles are similar to <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> On the other hand, ellipses are not all similar to <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> rectangles are not all similar to <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> and isosceles triangles are not all similar to <b>each</b> <b>other.</b>|$|R
50|$|In general, similar sized groups {{compete against}} <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Solos compete against solos, duos and trios against <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> small groups against <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> large groups against <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> and lines against <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Typically, {{placement}} awards are given {{out for each}} group size and style.|$|R
60|$|They {{soon became}} like {{brothers}} from community of wrongs: They wrote <b>each</b> <b>other</b> little odes and sang <b>each</b> <b>other</b> songs; They told <b>each</b> <b>other</b> anecdotes disparaging their wives; On several occasions, too, they saved <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> lives.|$|R

25|$|The western {{population}} {{extends from}} Dampier, south to Albany, with no {{records of the}} species between Albany and Spencer Gulf further west. The southern population occurs in Spencer Gulf and Gulf St Vincent, extending eastward to the Fleurieu Peninsula. Tagging {{studies have found that}} the populations in each of South Australia's Gulfs are isolated from <b>each</b> <b>others,</b> but no genetics studies have been undertaken to clarify this.|$|E
25|$|In {{the scene}} where the group are at the main {{entrance}} of the tomb, Patrick Troughton and Frazer Hines worked out in secret, without the knowledge of director Morris Barry, the brief sequence where both the Doctor and Jamie go to take Victoria {{by the hand and}} end up taking <b>each</b> <b>others.</b> This was in the knowledge that, with the recording schedule and the likelihood that re-takes would not be possible, {{it would have to be}} left in.|$|E
5000|$|Relationship between believers {{should be}} firm and bilateral. Two {{brothers}} are same as two hands washing <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Conflicts among brothers {{are to be}} replaced by peace and sincerity. According to a Prophetic tradition: [...] "Muslims are brethren, they never do wrong to <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> they never forgo supporting <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> they never abandon their brethren in hardships." [...] Imam Sadiq says: [...] "Muslims are brethren and serves as <b>each</b> <b>other’s</b> eye and guide.

5000|$|They love <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> They're {{best friends}} and {{they kind of}} finish off <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> sentences, {{understand}} <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> mood swings and reasoning but, as in all good relationships, they have lessons to teach <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> —Eccleston on the relationship between the Doctor and Rose ...|$|R
25|$|Starting {{from the}} basis of common citizenship, the two states to this day provide {{reciprocal}} recognition to <b>each</b> <b>others</b> citizens. British and Irish citizens can avail of public services (for example, health care and social welfare) in each other's jurisdictions on an equal basis and are entitled {{to the right of}} abode, with deportation only in the most exceptional of circumstances. They each have equal voting (and standing) rights in all elections held across the United Kingdom and Ireland (except for the election of the President of Ireland and referenda).|$|E
25|$|Many {{things went}} wrong with the {{operation}} that came to light afterwards, such as the RMPs only having 50 rounds each, when the minimum should have been 150. In the post-invasion time, it wasn't only their ammunition that had been de-scaled; the RMPs had no morphine and no smoke grenades either. A smoke grenade may have alerted the passing helicopters to their position. They {{did not have an}} Iridium satellite phone to call out of the area and {{because of a lack of}} intelligence and information sharing, the Paratroopers and the RMPs were unaware of <b>each</b> <b>others</b> location. Accusations that the Paras had left the RMPs behind were denied in the press by senior commanders just days after the event.|$|E
25|$|Except for {{a period}} during and {{in the years after}} World War II, neither Ireland nor the UK have placed {{restrictions}} on travel between each other for citizens resident in <b>each</b> <b>others</b> states since Irish independence. Even during wartime, when Ireland remained neutral and the United Kingdom was a belligerent during World War II, the only significant restrictions on travel between the states were an Irish prohibition on the wearing of military uniforms by British citizens when in Irish territory and the instatement of passport controls between Great Britain and the island of Ireland. When Ireland suddenly declared itself a republic in 1949, thus making it impossible to remain in the British Commonwealth, the UK government legislated that even though the Republic of Ireland was no longer a British dominion, it would not be treated as a foreign country for the purposes of British law.|$|E
40|$|People with {{learning}} difficulties {{have been involved}} in research that asked them to tell their stories about how they support (help) <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> -There were many times when people had helped <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in lots of different ways.   -People talked about times when they had listened to <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and helped <b>each</b> <b>other</b> when things were hard.

25|$|Ojibwa was {{assigned}} to the First Canadian Submarine Squadron on 22 April 1966, later joined by her sister boats and served virtually her entire career with Maritime Forces Atlantic (MARLANT) in the North Atlantic. Following the establishment of the First Canadian Submarine Squadron, personnel issues arose aboard Ojibwa and Rear-Admiral William Landymore was forced to intervene directly, relieving the commander of the submarine, Lt. Commander Samuel G. Tomlinson. Ojibwa spent time training with the Royal Navy after an exchange program was instituted in the 1960s that would see submarines from both the Royal Navy and Royal Canadian Navy spend time with <b>each</b> <b>others</b> forces. This allowed Canadian submarines on intelligence-gathering missions. Beginning in the 1970s, Canada began underwater surveillance patrols in the western Atlantic, tracking Soviet sub and surface fleet vessels, especially the ballistic missile submarines, usually in concert with an Argus or Aurora patrol aircraft. In 1977, Ojibwa made a short deployment to British Columbia with Maritime Forces Pacific (MARPAC) in 1977. She took part in WESTEX 77, a training exercise off the west coast.|$|E
500|$|After {{experiencing}} {{memories of}} her stay at Fairview and suspicions about the birth of [...] "Sully", Sharon ultimately pieces together the truth about Christian in April 2016. Dyan's aunt Patty Williams (Stacy Haiduk), who had been residing in Fairview at the time, informs Sharon that she never gave birth; Sharon conducts a DNA test and learns that [...] "Sully" [...] is really Christian. Shortly after, Sage discovers the truth herself and confronts Sharon, but ends up dying in a car accident. Sharon then decides to continue raising [...] "Sully" [...] as her own, not wanting to destroy her family with Dylan. She has nightmares of Sage and begins seeing her ghost, and briefly decides to stop taking her medication in order to [...] "stay in control". Sharon tells nobody else besides Mariah the truth; Case enjoyed building Sharon and Mariah's mother/daughter relationship {{in the process of}} the storyline, observing that [...] "they are <b>each</b> <b>others</b> confidantes, and they have <b>each</b> <b>others</b> back".|$|E
500|$|Fellow musicians {{have also}} {{presented}} dissenting views. Joni Mitchell described Dylan as a [...] "plagiarist" [...] {{and his voice}} as [...] "fake" [...] in a 2010 interview in the Los Angeles Times, {{despite the fact that}} Mitchell had toured with Dylan in the past, and both artists have covered <b>each</b> <b>others</b> songs. Mitchell's comment led to discussions of Dylan's use of other people's material, both supporting and criticizing him. Talking to Mikal Gilmore in Rolling Stone in 2012, Dylan responded to the allegation of plagiarism, including his use of Henry Timrod's verse in his album Modern Times, by saying that it was [...] "part of the tradition".|$|E

500|$|From {{an early}} age, Boulton had {{interested}} {{himself in the}} scientific advances of his times. [...] He discarded theories that electricity was {{a manifestation of the}} human soul, writing [...] "we know tis matter & tis wrong to call it Spirit". [...] He called such theories [...] "Cymeras [...] of <b>each</b> <b>others</b> Brain". [...] His interest brought him into contact with other enthusiasts such as John Whitehurst, who also {{became a member of the}} Lunar Society. In 1758 the Pennsylvania printer Benjamin Franklin, the leading experimenter in electricity, journeyed to Birmingham during one of his lengthy stays in Britain; Boulton met him, and introduced him to his friends. [...] Boulton worked with Franklin in efforts to contain electricity within a Leyden jar, and when the printer needed new glass for his [...] "glassychord" [...] (a mechanised version of musical glasses) he obtained it from Boulton.|$|E
500|$|On {{joining the}} cast of Holby City, Lewington commented: [...] "I've been on cloud nine since {{receiving}} that all-important phone call. My parents are surprised to suddenly have a doctor in the family but are thrilled nonetheless! I'm just {{really looking forward to}} being part of an incredible cast in such a successful show – I can't wait!" [...] A spokesperson for BBC Publicity added: [...] "We are delighted to have Nadine on board to play the part of Maddy, she's a great addition to the show and her character will be involved in some dramatic storylines." [...] Discussing her casting a year into her time on the show, Lewington assessed: [...] "I enjoy it more as I wade through the years. As with any ensemble work, the more time spent as a team, working together and discovering <b>each</b> <b>others</b> rhythms, dynamics and struggles, the better. And because of that, more fun. I certainly feel more settled and confident. Part of something. It was all a bit daunting for a while." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Go Ahead and Break My Heart" [...] was {{generally}} well received by music critics. Janine Schaults from Consequence of Sound enjoyed the track, {{claiming that the}} [...] "rousing duet [...] destined for hitsville", with her thanking Stefani for [...] "com in to save the day" [...] with her [...] "pouty vocals". Erlewine from AllMusic thought the song would qualify as [...] "an adult contemporary hit". Scott Stroud from The National favored it for being [...] "the least subtle" [...] of the [...] "hard-to-miss observations from his high-profile personal life". Mikael Wood, writing for Los Angeles Times, praised the collaboration, stating that Stefani provides [...] "the most striking lyrical moment on If I'm Honest", declaring it a [...] "handsome duet". Jessica Mule from Renowned for Sound selected the recording as [...] "an obvious track choice for the album", and complimented it for [...] "be quite captivating as they both play off <b>each</b> <b>others</b> own experiences". A reviewer from Sputnikmusic {{was surprised by the}} duet, in which he [...] "predict the song {{to be one of the}} weakest on th album"; instead he found it to [...] "be one of the strongest" [...] and claimed Stefani [...] "put forth a solid performance in [...] a surprisingly strong showing for both artists". Idolator's Robbie Daw acclaimed [...] "Go Ahead and Break My Heart", stating that [...] "as far as country-pop crossover duets go [...] we'd rate it just below Jason Aldean and Kelly Clarkson's 'Don't You Wanna Stay'".|$|E

500|$|Currently, {{in a bid}} {{to curtail}} the powers of the individual, {{collective}} leadership, the idea that decisions will be taken through consensus, has become the ideal in the CPC. The concept has its origins back to Vladimir Lenin and the Russian Bolshevik Party. At the level of the central party leadership this means that, for instance, all members of the Politburo Standing Committee are of equal standing (each member having only one vote). A member of the Politburo Standing Committee often represents a sector; during Mao's reign, he controlled the People's Liberation Army, Kang Sheng, the security apparatus, and Zhou Enlai, the State Council and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This counts as informal power. Despite this, in a paradoxical relation, members of a body are ranked hierarchically (despite the fact that members are in theory equal to <b>each</b> <b>others).</b> In spite of this, the CPC is led by an informal leader principle, each collective leadership is led by a core, that is a paramount leader; a person who holds the offices of CPC general secretary, CMC chairman and President of the PRC. Before Jiang Zemin's tenure as paramount leader, the party core and collective leadership were indistinguishable. In practice, the core was not responsible to the collective leadership. However, by the time of Jiang, the party had begun propagating a responsibility system, referring to it in official pronouncements as the [...] "core of the collective leadership".|$|E

The exploration begins with Strategic appropriateness: questionable answers, and finishes with Action implications: consensus, uncertainty and action formulation. Conditions for progress in strategy-making are more explicitly brought up in pages such as Strategic ecosystem: integrating constraint and opposition, and Post-crisis opportunities: in quest of radical coherence.|$|E
