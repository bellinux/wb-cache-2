We have developed a sensitive fluorescence-based method for the assay of transglycosylating activity of GH 72 enzymes.

The N 2 -H 2 -CH 4 -rich gases are bubbling in hyperalkaline springs (OH–-rich) knownin the peridotite massif of {{the southern part of}} the island. This <b>family</b> of <b>gas</b> shows contents of N 2 between 50 and 62 %, H 2 between 26 and 36 %, and CH 4 between 11 and 16 %. δ 13 C values of methane are ranging from − 39 to− 32 ‰. We interpret the origin of H 2 as a product of fluid-rock interaction between basic-ultrabasic rocks andwater with oxidation of Fe 2 + and reduction of underground water in the fracture system of the peridotitesnappe. Methane is interpreted as the result of a reduction of dissolved inorganic and/or organic carbon in subsurfaceaquifers. The second <b>family</b> of <b>gas</b> emissions was found in thermal springs in the sedimentary units locatedstructurally below the peridotites nappe. The gas is composed mostly of N 2 (between 97 and 98 %) associatedwith relatively high concentration of He.

We used prostate cancer cell transfectants genetically modified to be deficient in either endogenous fibroblast growth factor (FGF- 1) or endogenous FGF- 2 to examine FGF maintenance of transfectant survival and proliferation and FGF- 2 -regulated expression of transfectant growth arrest DNA damage (GADD) and growth arrest sequences (<b>GAS)</b> <b>family</b> genes (known modulators of cell cycle progression and survival) and the AS 3 gene (an androgen-modulated effector of prostate cell proliferation). When propagated {{in the absence of}} exogenous FGFs, FGF- 2 -deficient transfectants undergo exponential death, whereas FGF- 1 -deficient transfectants proliferate. Exogenous FGF- 1, FGF- 2, FGF- 7, or FGF- 8 promote survival and proliferation of FGF- 2 -deficient transfectants and enhance FGF- 1 -deficient transfectant proliferation. Transfectants express FGF receptor FGFR 1, FGFR 2 (IIIb), FGFR 2 (IIIc), and FGFR 3 transcripts, findings consistent with the effects of exogenous FGFs. FGF- 2 -deficient transfectants express high levels of AS 3, GADD 45 A, GADD 45;, GAS 8, and GAS 11 transcripts and moderate levels of GADD 153, GAS 2, GAS 3, and GAS 6 transcripts and lack demonstrable GAS 1 or GAS 5 transcripts. FGF withdrawal-mediated death of FGF- 2 -deficient transfectants did not significantly affect cell AS 3, GADD 153, GADD 45;, GAS 2, GAS 3, GAS 7, GAS 8, or GAS 11 transcript content, whereas GADD 45 A and GAS 6 transcript content was elevated. These studies establish that endogenous FGF- 2 dominantly regulates prostate cancer cell survival and proliferation and that exogenous FGFs may assume this function in the absence of endogenous FGF- 2. Additionally, we provide the first evidence that FGFs regulate prostate GADD 45 A and GAS 6 transcript content. The latter observations suggest that GADD 45 A and GAS 6 proteins may be effectors of processes that regulate prostate cancer cell survival. Additional studies are required to examine this possibility in detail. (Mol Cancer Res 2004; 2 (11) : 653 – 61...|$|E
40|$|Sporulation is a {{developmental}} {{variation of the}} yeast life cycle whereby four spores are produced within a diploid cell, with proliferation resuming after germination. The <b>GAS</b> <b>family</b> of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glucan-remodeling enzymes exemplifies functional interplay between paralogous genes during the yeast life cycle. GAS 1 and GAS 5 are expressed in vegetative cells and repressed during sporulation while GAS 2 and GAS 4 exhibit a reciprocal pattern. GAS 3 is weakly expressed in all the conditions and encodes an inactive protein. Although Gas 1 p functions in cell wall formation, we show that it persists during sporulation but is relocalized from the plasma membrane to the epiplasm in a process requiring End 3 p-mediated endocytosis and the Sps 1 protein kinase of the p 21 -activated kinase family. Some Gas 1 p is also newly synthesized and localized to the spore membrane, but this fraction is dispensable for spore formation. By way of contrast, the Gas 2 -Gas 4 proteins, which are essential for spore wall assembly, are rapidly degraded after spore formation. On germination, Gas 1 p is actively synthesized and concentrated in the growing part of the spore, which is essential for its elongation. Thus Gas 1 p is the primary glucan-remodeling enzyme required in vegetative growth and during reentry into the proliferative state.

40|$|Accurately calculating {{greenhouse}} emissions {{is essential}} for good policy, argures Ilan Salbe • IN THE current political climate the prospects of significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions might seem bleak. Only last year the US Senate jettisoned its emission cap-and-trade scheme legislation program. The Australian government, battered and bruised by the Copenhagen experience, had thrown the towel {{in a few months}} earlier, with a new multi-party climate change committee unlikely, in my view, to grasp the nettle. With a carbon price and an emission cap lost in a maze of political trepidation and expediency, why now worry about the details of the accounting of greenhouse gas emissions? And why focus on methane? The paramount reason is that only with an accurate system of emissions accounting can the Australian government and its people get a clear understanding of how and how much Australia contributes to global warming. Then, with that understanding, we can decide what policies are needed to best reduce that contribution. The reason to focus on the accounting now is that implementing measures like a cap-and-trade scheme or a carbon tax will be a hard slog, with great administrative and compliance complexities. Making an early start, including developing robust methods for accounting of emissions, will mean that when the politicians are finally ready to act then subsequent further years of teething pain will be avoided. Methane needs focusing on because it’s been the politically ignored unsexy member of the greenhouse <b>gas</b> <b>family.</b> It makes up around a fifth of Australia’s current emissions. Most of those emissions emanate from the agriculture sector, whose activities urban Australians are not passionate about, beyond perhaps a respect for the iconic farmer. This is in contrast to carbon dioxide, which makes up around seventy-five percent of Australia’s emissions, and has the easier to relate to issues of coal power stations, cutting down of ancient forests etc. In what follows the greenhouse gas accounting framework is introduced, a bias in the framework uncovered, the mooing cow is shown to be a lot less innocent than it looks and the need for an ally to face reality for the sake of planetary health is explained. The framework The methodology for reporting on greenhouse gas emissions is subject to a hierarchy of controls. At the highest level is the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which has the ultimate objective of “stabilising… greenhouse gas concentrations at a level that would prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system. ” The UNFCCC and the associated 1997 Kyoto protocol provide the overarching emissions-reporting obligations and guidelines for parties to those treaties. The UNFCCC’s 93 -page reporting guidelines cover estimation methodologies, reporting formats, the needs for transparency, consistency and accuracy, and requirements for reporting levels of uncertainty on published emissions data. The Kyoto protocol reporting guidelines differ slightly, mainly in relation to the treatment of land use, land use change and forestry activities. In Australia, the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007, administered by the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, is the main legal instrument for meeting emissions-reporting obligations. There are also accompanying regulations and other legal instruments. Unlike Acts, which are passed by parliament, regulations are created and modified by ministers and public servants, albeit legally constrained not to contradict the intent of the parent Act. In some respects, Acts {{can be thought of as}} building frameworks, while regulations are the interior decoration, and therein lays the potential for “devil in the detail. ” The National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 enforces a regime of annual emissions reporting. Emissions data for the years 1991 – 2008 is available on the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency website. A bias in the UNFCCC framework The UNFCCC accounting framework is well nigh impossible to comprehend fully because of the magnitude and complexity of the underlying science. The bias in accounting for methane emissions described below was discovered serendipitously. It relates to the equivalence ratio employed in the UNFCCC framework. A CSIRO chief scientist kindly helped out with some of the science. Equivalence ratios are analogous to currency exchange rates. They allow emissions of greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide to be brought back to a single “currency,” the CO 2 equivalent, whose sign is not the familiar $A but rather the CO 2 -e. The equivalence ratios are derived from the study of the global warming potential of gases relative to carbon dioxide, calculated over a specified period of time. A period needs to be specified because some gases remain in the atmosphere for less time than others, due to various atmospheric interactions (for example, a major component in methane breakdown is its reaction with hydroxyl radicals in the tropospheric layer of the atmosphere). Short living gases have higher relative (to carbon dioxide) warming potential when compared over small periods. For longer periods, with less of the gas remaining, the relative warming potential decreases. Typical equivalence ratio periods used in official reports are 20 years, 100 years and 500 years. As an example, methane’s 20 -year period equivalence ratio value is 72. That means that over a 20 -year period, a volume of methane emitted into the atmosphere causes 72 times the warming of an equivalent amount (the same molecular mass) of emitted carbon dioxide. The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the official setter of equivalence ratio values, which it regularly reviews. Generally, reviews of significant greenhouse gases have resulted in increased equivalence ratios – in other words, advances in the science have led to an understanding that key gases are causing greater warming than previously thought. Methane’s equivalence ratios have increased as per the following table. Methane Equivalence Ratios   Comparison Period Year estimated by IPCC 20 years 100 years 500 years 1995 56 21 6. 5 2001 62 23 7 2007 72 25 7. 6 Yet, to this day, the UNFCCC guidelines prescribe that emissions reporting apply the IPCC- 1995 equivalence ratios. They also prescribe that the 100 -year period be used, which as shown for methane in the table, has much smaller equivalence ratios than for the 20 -year period (again because methane doesn’t stay in the atmosphere anywhere near as long as carbon dioxide). By trawling though the UNFCCC website, one can see that the IPCC- 1995 equivalence ratios were first earmarked for replacement as far back as 2004. Australia’s position Australia put its position on using updated equivalence ratios in a 2008 submission to the UNFCCC. Australia suggested that the IPCC- 2007 equivalence ratios replace the IPCC- 1995 set. However, Australia wanted the use of the 100 -year period to continue for two reasons: an absence of compelling scientific or policy arguments for alternative time horizons, and the fact that a change in time frame would unnecessarily introduce complexities relating to accounting and time series consistency without any appreciable general benefit. How greater complexity would be introduced and inconsistency added was not explained. It should be a simple enough computing exercise to re-derive previously published emissions data using 20 -year or 40 -year equivalence ratios. That process would create a set of consistent and comparable historical emissions data. Perhaps the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency’s abacus beads get tangled with larger emission numbers? More scientifically scary than the thought of departmental beads tangling, and implicitly assumed with the use of 100 -year period equivalence ratios, is that climate policy is targeting the stabilisation of atmospheric gases over that period – that is, we have a century to get things right. However, science tells us that the first possible encounter with a climate change tipping point could happen way before another 100 years have passed. This, then, is the compelling policy reason (that the department couldn’t find) to change to a smaller period than 100 -years. The whole aim of climate change policy is to avert global disaster and our greenhouse gas accounting system should be aimed at giving us the most accurate picture of how we are tracking. In effect, Australia accepted the smaller increase caused by updating to the IPCC- 2007 100 -year equivalence ratio value but rejected the larger increase associated with switching to a 20 -year or 40 -year period. Was Australia’s position really about applying the precautionary principle on side of economic prosperity, especially that of the agriculture sector, rather than on the environmental side? There has been continuous debate about whether agriculture should be included in emission abatement schemes and if so at what stage. Underestimation of its greenhouse gas impact makes it easier to delay its inclusion.  Recently the UNFCCC decided to defer any final decision on adopting updated equivalence ratios until after the IPCC Fifth Assessment reporting in 2012, an example of how dreadfully slowly things move in UN processes. And what about the mooing cow?Australia’s love affair with BBQ steak and roast lamb may provide an additional explanation for the government’s fear to move away from 100 -year equivalence ratios. According to the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, methane emissions made up 21 per cent of Australia’s total greenhouse gas emissions in 2008. About 60 per cent of those methane emissions were from the agricultural sector, with a good portion of those arising from the digestive processes of cattle (mainly), sheep and other ruminants. If the department were to recalculate its emission data using 20 -year equivalence ratios, then methane emissions would make up around 40 per cent of Australia’s 2008 total and the heating contribution of ruminants would approach that of coal power stations. In the grander scheme of things, Australian meat-lovers may need to change their habits as much as those so-called big polluters. And, finally, what of the Kiwis? New Zealand, a nation with a reliance on agricultural production, will have their emission numbers greatly inflated with the use of shorter period equivalence ratios. Under the current greenhouse accounting methodology, agriculture already makes up almost exactly 50 per cent of New Zealand’s total emissions. Those agricultural emissions, as well as the nation’s total emissions, have been growing in recent years. If the UNFCCC were to adopt shorter period equivalence ratios, reversing that emission growth would be harder and bring extra economic hardships. World agreements will eventually demand that reversal of emission growth so this is no idle threat Undoubtedly there are other countries in the same boat as New Zealand. Disproportionate impacts abound with climate change action, part of the reason why it’s so difficult. That doesn’t mean Australia should stick its head in the sand in the hope of avoiding economic pain for our pals or ourselves. Policy compilation and implementation must be correctly informed on how methane is contributing to global warming. Australia should now advocate for the use of shorter period equivalence ratios and the UNFCCC should adopt them. Otherwise the planet will pay a disproportionate price. • Ilan Salbe has been working as a public servant for over 20 years modelling the water supply systems of Sydney and the Murray and Murrumbidgee Valleys.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} various potential models {{in the description of}} vapor–liquid equilibria (VLE) and adsorption of simple gases on highly graphitized thermal carbon black. It is found that some potential models proposed in the literature are not suitable for the description of VLE (saturated gas and liquid densities and the vapor pressure with temperature). Simple gases, such as neon, argon, krypton, xenon, nitrogen, and methane are studied in this paper. To describe the isotherms on graphitized thermal carbon black correctly, the surface mediation damping factor introduced in our recent publication should be used to calculate correctly the fluid–fluid interaction energy between particles close to the surface. It is found that the damping constant for the noble <b>gases</b> <b>family</b> is linearly dependent on the polarizability, suggesting that the electric field of the graphite surface has a direct induction effect on the induced dipole of these molecules. As a result of this polarization by the graphite surface, the fluid–fluid interaction energy is reduced whenever two particles are near the surface. In the case of methane, we found that the damping constant is less than that of a noble gas having the similar polarizability, while in the case of nitrogen the damping factor is much greater and this could most likely be due to the quadrupolar nature of nitrogen...|$|R

A turbojet does not rely purely on the motion of the engine to compress the incoming air flow; instead, the turbojet contains some additional rotating machinery that compresses incoming air and allows the engine to function during takeoff and at slow speeds. Independent single engine for all times is created by combination of these two to hybrid one.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} analyzed family characteristics, knowledge, perception, preference, {{and behavior}} of natural gas utilization; analyzed correlation among research’s variables; and identified the variables that influenced the behavior of natural gas utilization in Tegal Gundil, Bogor City. This research involved 60 families who used natural gas. Data collected by interview with questionnaire and was analyzed by descriptive, Pearson correlation, and regression test. The results showed that mostly family had good knowledge and perception about natural <b>gas.</b> Mostly <b>family</b> prefer to natural gas compare to others fuels. Research results also showed that all of <b>family</b> used natural <b>gas</b> to cook every day. Knowledge and perception about natural gas correlated significant with mother’s education and family income. Knowledge correlated positive significant with perception. Meanwhile, behavior of natural gas utilization was influenced by husband’s work and amount of family member.           </p...|$|R
50|$|Government {{officials}} {{assert that}} Khan, under KSM's tutelage, was being trained {{to blow up}} gas stations and poison water reservoirs, and that he plotted to assassinate Pakistani President General Pervez Musharraf. Khan's job at the <b>family</b> <b>gas</b> station {{played a role in}} the suspicions of U.S. intelligence analysts that he was part of a plot to blow up parts of the U.S. petroleum infrastructure. The U.S. government contends that Khan was aware that his visit to family in Pakistan in 2002 violated the terms of his asylum granted in 1998.|$|R

Detroit Unleaded was first released as a 20-minute short film in 2007. Nashef raised $20,000 from the local community to make the short. She later expanded on the story to release it as a feature-length film in 2012. It premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2012 and won the Grolsch Film Works Discovery Award.|$|R
50|$|Baalu was {{centre of}} a {{controversy}} involving illicit allocation of <b>gas</b> to his <b>family</b> owned King Chemicals and King Hi Power in 2004. In 2010, there were widespread protests {{by the local}} farmers against the Baalu's family owned industrial alcohol distillery in Vadaseri, a village in Thanjavur district against the establishment of it would reduce the ground water supply in the region. Internal rivalry in the DMK party emerged between Baalu and S.S. Palanimanickam, the MP from Thanjavur constituency and the district secretary of the DMK in Thanjavur, in 2012, when Baalu initiated a survey for railway lines in Thanjavur district.|$|R
40|$|The {{mammalian}} DREAM {{complex is}} a key regulator of cell-cycle-regulated gene transcription and drives the expression of many gene products required for mitosis and cytokinesis. In this study, we characterized GAS 2 L 3, which belongs to the <b>GAS</b> 2 <b>family</b> of proteins with putative actin- and microtubule-binding domains as a target gene of DREAM. We found that GAS 2 L 3 localizes to the spindle midzone and the midbody during anaphase and cytokinesis, respectively. Biochemical studies show that GAS 2 L 3 binds to and bundles microtubules as well as F-actin in vitro. Strikingly, the RNAi-mediated knockdown of GAS 2 L 3 results in chromosome segregation defects in multinucleated cells and in cells with multi-lobed nuclei. Likewise, chronic downregulation of GAS 2 L 3 causes chromosome loss and aneuploidy. Time-lapse videomicroscopy experiments in GAS 2 L 3 -knockdown cells reveal abnormal oscillation of chromatin and the spindle during cytokinesis. Taken together, our data reveal novel, important roles of GAS 2 L 3 for faithful cell division. Our work thus contributes {{to the understanding of}} how DREAM regulates cytokinesis...|$|R
