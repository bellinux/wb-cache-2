25|$|There {{followed}} {{in quick succession}} two musicals which have secured Kelly's reputation as a major figure in the American musical film, An American in Paris (1951) and – probably {{the most popular and}} admired of all film musicals – Singin' in the Rain (1952). As co-director, lead star and choreographer, Kelly was the central driving force. Johnny Green, head of music at MGM at the time, said of him:Gene is easygoing as long as you <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are doing when you're working with him. He's a hard taskmaster and he loves hard work. If you want to play on his team you'd better like hard work, too. He isn't cruel but he is tough, and if Gene believed in something he didn't care who he was talking to, whether it was Louis B. Mayer or the gatekeeper. He wasn't awed by anybody, and he had a good record of getting what he wanted.|$|E
25|$|One likely {{reason for}} the {{relatively}} few Japanese words for 'fool' is vagueness. In both English and Japanese, the words for 'fool' have meanings that vary along scales of friendly-hostile, or joking-serious. In English, {{at one end of}} a scale are words like silly goose and at the other end are words like stupid asshole. And in Japanese, at one end are words like kamaboko baka 蒲鉾馬鹿 'silly chump' and at the other end are words like baka-yarō 馬鹿野郎 'damn fool'. The difference is in the degree of lexical diversification along the scales of meaning. English seems to have more 'fool' words with more specificity – Japanese seems to have fewer 'fool' words with more vagueness. There are decided pragmatic and communicative advantages to such lexical vagueness. If you call me a stupid son-of-a-bitch, I <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean. But if you call me a baka-yarō, I cannot be so sure of what you mean. The expression baka-yarō 馬鹿野郎 {{is one of the most}} insulting terms in the Japanese lexicon, but it is vague and can range in meaning from an affectionate 'silly-willy' to an abusive 'jerk-off fool'. Baka-yarō is so widely used that it has become semantically weak and vague. Such vagueness can serve to conceal hostility and thus to maintain social harmony.|$|E
500|$|... "Inside Out" [...] is an electropop {{song that}} {{features}} themes of dubstep and R, complimented with [...] "earth-shattering synths". Lyrically, the [...] "sexy breakup song", {{as described by}} Jocelyn Vena of MTV, opens with Spears singing, [...] "Said you're gonna {{be here in a}} minute/ Sitting in the mirror getting pretty/ Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up/ Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up/ I can hear you knocking at the front door/ And I <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> came for/ Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy/ Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy." [...] While the couple seems {{to be on the verge}} of a breakup, there's apparently still some sexual tension between them, which is perceived in lines such as [...] "You ... touch me and it's breaking me down/ I'm telling you, let's just give it up and get down." [...] Spears crescendos [...] "So come on/Won't you give me something to remember/Baby shut your mouth and turn me inside out."

2500|$|On October 22, 2003, {{during his}} one-day shift as Acting Mayor, while Mayor Willie Brown {{traveled}} to Tibet, Daly appointed two {{members to the}} San Francisco Public Utilities Commission without Brown's consent, having consulted with the City Attorney who had advised him that as acting mayor he had the legal authority to make appointments in Mayor Brown's absence. [...] Brown, who had his own people in mind for the assignments, had a different opinion, stating that [...] " [...] were made by {{a person who was}} supposed to be operating in a ceremonial capacity... a conspiracy to... move away from the traditions, the rules, the customs and the conduct that has been the hallmark of this city, long before I became mayor of this city."

It's like stalking. <b>You</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> were intending to do. You concealed all your steps. You carefully plotted, then you did it behind closed doors, and then you laughed about it." [...] Brown said he found out about Daly's actions when his chief of staff called him in Tibet. Brown was sleeping at the time but with the assistance of Chinese officials, was on a plane home within hours, cutting short his trade and promotion trip to China—reportedly explaining the matter to his hosts simply as a [...] "coup." ...|$|R

5000|$|The show {{opened with}} Stan Lee {{appearing}} on the television, announcing another challenge. Each hero was to write questions to ask each other anonymously, then send the questions via pneumatic tube to Lee.Lee soon announced a second challenge, focusing on valor and will. Following the challenge, Lee announced the remaining superheroes would be treated to new costumes. While most of the costume updates were uneventful, Ty'Veculus's caused a bit of controversy. His old helmet was replaced with a Centurion-style one including a large feathered ridge, and his suit had become golden padded armor. Upon inspection, Lee commented that the suit wasn't {{what he had in}} mind and questioned the designers. Following several interviews with the other superheroes regarding Iron Enforcer's complete inability to fit in, the camera cut to the suitless Enforcer walking down the street. Suddenly, Lee appeared on a junked TV as Iron Enforcer passed it. Lee announced, [...] "Hey, Iron Enforcer... During your makeover something was bothering me, and I couldn't put my finger on it, but now I <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> it is. <b>You</b> make a lousy superhero... but you'd make a great supervillain!" [...] Enforcer agreed to the new identity, and the design team from earlier pulled him into a van for transformation. Out stepped a tall, black-suited villain with a skull-like mask. Stan Lee announced the arrival of his newest creation, The Dark Enforcer, and said that life for the superheroes was about to become a lot more difficult.|$|R
