In 2006, Jared Leto created the cover art for , a compilation of live music that includes a Thirty Seconds to Mars song, which proceeds from the sales benefited The Nature Conservancy.

5|$|At this point, {{still early}} in his {{surgical}} career, Negus took {{a different approach to}} that which was common at the time. Rather than be apprenticed to a leading surgeon in his ENT (ear, nose and throat) speciality, he undertook basic research on the structure of the larynx that would lead to a higher degree in 1924 and the publication of books and papers on the topic in later years. While engaged in this research, Negus continued his work at King's College Hospital, being appointed junior surgeon in 1924. It was during this period, following his return from the USA, that Negus both promoted the methods and tools he had seen used in Philadelphia by Jackson, and worked to improve the designs of the endoscopes and other equipment used in ENT surgery. These instruments, developed in collaboration with the Genito-Urinary Company of London, included laryngoscopes, bronchoscopes (such as the Negus bronchoscope) and oesophagoscopes. Other surgical innovations developed by Negus included an operating table (known as the King's College table), and a speaking valve for use in tracheotomy tubes. He also helped <b>develop</b> <b>strategies</b> for treatments of throat cancer to aid the choice between surgery and radiotherapy.|$|E
5|$|The Whistler Sliding Centre in Whistler, British Columbia was {{the site}} of women's {{skeleton}} at the 2010 Olympic Games in Vancouver, Canada. The track was constructed between 2005 and 2008, and became only the 15th competition-level track in the world. It was certified for competition in sliding sports by the International Luge Federation (FIL) and the International Bobsleigh and Tobogganing Federation (FIBT) in March, 2008 in a process called homologation where hundreds of athletes ran the track. This was the first time many competitors at the 2010 Games were able to try the track and begin to <b>develop</b> <b>strategies</b> for it. Canadian athletes hoped that having it open two years before the Games, and having that amount of time to train on it, would give them an advantage in the Games. The Whistler Sliding Centre quickly gained {{a reputation as one of}} the fastest tracks in the world.|$|E

5|$|Treloar's death {{left the}} AWM {{in a state}} of crisis. Due to his close control over the Memorial, none of its staff knew what his plans had been and it was unclear how to {{continue}} key tasks such as completing the Roll of Honour, classifying and displaying items collected during World War II and managing the Memorial's finances. In addition, two fifths of the AWM's staff positions were vacant as Treloar had chosen to delay filling these vacancies. Jim McGrath, who had been the Memorial's Assistant Director (Administration) since May 1951, became acting director when Treloar was hospitalised and was confirmed in this position on 15May 1952; Bazley had also applied for this job but lost to McGrath despite having Bean's support. Under the direction of Bean, who had been appointed the Chairman of the Memorial's Board in June 1951, McGrath established a committee to <b>develop</b> <b>strategies</b> for both completing and further developing the Memorial. Bean also personally reviewed the Memorial's collection of World War I artefacts during 1952 and 1953, and found that the register of these items was inadequate and {{it was not possible to}} locate many of them. He attributed this to the movement of the collection between Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra and the changes of directorship during periods in which Treloar was absent.|$|E

Among twenty-plus incidents, a man was knocked down and beaten near the Big Four Bridge, and a large group ransacked a convenience store on South First Street. Although LMPD had deployed extra officers due to the potential for trouble after the death of a juvenile stabbed on a TARC bus several days earlier, the officers were based along West Broadway, away from where the mob attack took place. In the days following the mob incident, residents criticized LMPD for their response. The Downtown Area Patrol was established {{as a result of the}} attack and outcry, and led the Louisville and Jeffersonville, Indiana police departments to <b>develop</b> <b>strategies</b> to combat issues at the Big Four Bridge, which connects the two cities via a walking path.

25|$|Jack Aubrey and Sophia Williams {{are married}} {{and the parents}} of twin girls. They live at Ashgrove Cottage on his half-pay, not enough to support fellow navy men in the household. Sophia's mother lost her money, {{including}} Sophia's portion, and now lives with them. They have Cecelia, Sophia's young niece in their household as well. As much as he loves Sophia, Aubrey {{is ready to go}} to sea again. Stephen Maturin comes to call, and soon after Aubrey's orders are delivered from the port Admiral. He is given command of the 38-gun frigate HMS Boadicea. At Plymouth, he picks up orders and Mr R T Farquhar, a political gentleman. He is to sail to the station at Cape Town where the ships of a convoy will meet. Not long away from home, they meet with the French ship Hébé which is escorting a captured merchant ship. The Boadicea captures both ships. He sends the prizes to Gibraltar. The timely capture allows the ship to send letters home, gain a French cook and the Hébé's English prisoners, able seamen. The long journey in the Atlantic gives Aubrey time to bring the crew of the Boadicea up to his standards of efficiency in gunnery, and gives Maturin and Farquhar time to <b>develop</b> <b>strategies.</b>|$|E
500|$|In the games, Mewtwo is {{consistently}} noted as {{being one of}} the strongest opponents, and has been described in Pokémon Red and Blue as being [...] "the best Pokémon in the game", as well as [...] "one of the rarest — and hardest to catch". Because of the character's multiple strengths and few weaknesses, it changed how players approached playing against each other, causing players to either <b>develop</b> <b>strategies</b> solely to defeat an opposing Mewtwo, or prohibit its use when battling other players. IGN's staff bemoaned its exclusion from Super Smash Bros. Brawl. A poll by IGN on whether the character was missed by others in Brawl shared a similar sentiment, though they also described it as one of Super Smash Bros. Melees weakest characters. Professional Super Smash Bros. player Jason [...] "Mew2King" [...] Zimmerman takes his handle from Mewtwo, although he uses other characters in competition. Authors Tracey West and Katherine Noll called Mewtwo the fifth best Legendary Pokémon and the sixth best Pokémon overall.|$|E
500|$|The {{tour was}} officially {{announced}} on August 31, 2006 by MTV2 {{as a part}} of the $2Bill tour, which previously attracted a diverse mix of music artists, including Beastie Boys, Radiohead, Coldplay, and Kanye West. Set for October 2006, the tour showcased Thirty Seconds to Mars' second studio album A Beautiful Lie. It commenced on October 17, 2006 in Minneapolis, Minnesota and ended on November 25, 2006 in Los Angeles, California. The tour was announced shortly after the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards at which Thirty Seconds to Mars received the MTV2 Award for their single [...] "The Kill". A limited number of tickets per city were made available for $2 each in a special internet pre-sale sponsored by MTV2 and Thirty Seconds to Mars beginning on September 16. Sales for general tickets began the following week on September 23. Determined to offset the impact that the tour would have on the environment, Thirty Seconds to Mars worked to <b>develop</b> <b>strategies</b> that would minimize fuel consumption and all touring vehicles were powered by low-emissions renewable biodiesel, a fuel made partly from vegetable oil.

The plan included provisions for the college to offer more academic opportunities for the community and to explore moving its bookstore into the downtown area, develop student housing in the downtown area, and to expand student use of the downtown eating, shopping, and visiting destinations. The City of Washington began a downtown revitalization project featuring new sidewalks, landscaping, and fiber-optic cables.
