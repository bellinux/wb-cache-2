40|$|Most {{persons in}} <b>drug</b> <b>treatment</b> smoke cigarettes. Until <b>drug</b> <b>treatment</b> {{facilities}} systematically treat their patients' tobacco use, millions will {{flow through the}} <b>drug</b> <b>treatment</b> system, overcome their primary drug of abuse, but die prematurely from tobacco-related illnesses. This paper reviews {{the literature on the}} health benefits of quitting smoking for <b>drug</b> <b>treatment</b> patients, whether smoking causes relapse to other drug or alcohol abuse, the treatment of tobacco dependence, and good and bad times for quitting smoking among <b>drug</b> <b>treatment</b> patients. It also presents a conceptual model and recommendations for treating tobacco in substance abuse treatment, and provides references to internet and paper-copy tools and information for treating tobacco dependence. At present, research on tobacco <b>treatment</b> in <b>drug</b> <b>treatment</b> is in its infancy. Although few <b>drug</b> <b>treatment</b> programs currently offer formal services, many more will likely begin to treat nicotine dependence as external forces and patient demand for these services increases. In the absence of clear guidelines and attention to quality of care, <b>drug</b> <b>treatment</b> programs may adopt smoking cessation services based on cost, convenience, or selection criteria other than efficacy. Because research in this field is relatively new, substance abuse treatment professionals should adhere to the standards of care for the general population, but be prepared to update their practices with emerging interventions that have proven to be effective for patients in <b>drug</b> <b>treatment...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This study uses an {{experimental}} design comparing 235 offenders assigned either to <b>drug</b> <b>treatment</b> court or treatment as usual. It extends prior analyses {{of this study}} sample to examine whether differences observed between <b>drug</b> <b>treatment</b> court subjects and control subjects at one and {{two years after the}} start of the program persist after three years, when many of the subjects had ceased active treatment. Further, it extends earlier analyses that showed that the quantity of <b>drug</b> <b>treatment</b> court services received was related to lower recidivism rates by using an instrumental variables approach to handle the endogeneity problem that sometimes arises when subjects self-select into different levels of service. Results show a sustained treatment effect on recidivism, controlling for time at risk. This effect {{is not limited to the}} period during which services are delivered. Rather, it persists even after participation in the drug court program ceases. Results also show that the recidivism is lowest among subjects who participate at higher levels in certified <b>drug</b> <b>treatment,</b> status hearings, and drug testing. These positive findings are tempered with findings that more than three-fourths of clients are re-arrested within three years, regardless of participation in the <b>drug</b> <b>treatment</b> court, and that <b>drug</b> <b>treatment</b> court cases spend approximately the same number of days incarcerated as do control cases.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: In many {{patients}} with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), residual symptoms persist despite a clinically meaningful response. The {{objective of this}} study was to examine whether addition of behavior therapy would augment treatment outcome in these patients. METHOD: Ninety-six patients with DSM-IV OCD who had responded to 3 months of <b>drug</b> <b>treatment</b> were randomly assigned to either receive addition of behavior therapy or continue on <b>drug</b> <b>treatment</b> alone for 6 months. Patients who continued on <b>drug</b> <b>treatment</b> alone eventually received addition of behavior therapy for 6 months. Data were gathered from October 1998 to June 2002. RESULTS: OCD patients who received addition of behavior therapy showed a greater improvement in obsessive-compulsive symptoms (Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale [Y-BOCS] score change = - 3. 9 in the completers sample) than those who continued on <b>drug</b> <b>treatment</b> alone (Y-BOCS score change = + 3. 9 for completers). Significantly more patients who received addition of behavior therapy were in remission compared with those who continued on <b>drug</b> <b>treatment</b> alone (p <. 0001 for completers). Patients who received behavior therapy after 6 months of <b>drug</b> <b>treatment</b> alone showed a nonsignificant decline in obsessive-compulsive symptoms (Y-BOCS score change = - 2. 7 for completers); however, the remission rate found in this group was comparable to the remission rate found in the group of patients receiving addition of behavior therapy directly after responding to <b>drug</b> <b>treatment.</b> CONCLUSION: The results indicate that addition of behavior therapy is beneficial for patients who have responded to <b>drug</b> <b>treatment.</b> The data also suggest that the effect is greater when behavior therapy is added immediately after attainment of the drug respons...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Premature {{ejaculation}} (PE) {{is defined}} by short ejaculatory latency and inability to delay ejaculation causing distress. Management may involve behavioral and/or pharmacological approaches. Aim To systematically review the randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence for behavioral therapies {{in the management of}} PE. Methods Nine databases including MEDLINE were searched to August 2013. Included RCTs compared behavioral therapy against waitlist control or another therapy, or behavioral plus drug therapy against <b>drug</b> <b>treatment</b> alone. Main Outcome Measure Intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT), sexual satisfaction, ejaculatory control, and anxiety and adverse effects. Results Ten RCTs (521 participants) were included. Overall risk of bias was unclear. All studies assessed physical techniques, including squeeze and stop-start, sensate focus, stimulation device, and pelvic floor rehabilitation. Only one RCT included a psychotherapeutic approach (combined with stop-start and <b>drug</b> <b>treatment).</b> Four trials compared behavioral therapies against waitlist control, of which two (involving squeeze, stop-start, and sensate focus) reported IELT differences of 7 – 9 minutes, whereas two (web-based sensate focus, stimulation device) reported no difference in ejaculatory latency posttreatment. For other outcomes (sexual satisfaction, desire, and self-confidence), some waitlist comparisons significantly favored behavioral therapy, whereas others were not significant. Three trials favored combined behavioral and <b>drug</b> <b>treatment</b> over <b>drug</b> <b>treatment</b> alone, with small but significant differences in IELT (0. 5 – 1 minute) and significantly better results on other outcomes (sexual satisfaction, ejaculatory control, and anxiety). Direct comparisons of behavioral therapy vs. <b>drug</b> <b>treatment</b> gave mixed results, mostly either favoring <b>drug</b> <b>treatment</b> or showing no significant difference. No adverse effects were reported, though safety data were limited. Conclusions There is limited evidence that physical behavioral techniques for PE improve IELT and other outcomes over waitlist and that behavioral therapies combined with <b>drug</b> <b>treatments</b> give better outcomes than <b>drug</b> <b>treatments</b> alone. Further RCTs are required to assess psychotherapeutic approaches to P...|$|R
40|$|The Crinan Youth Project is a {{systemic}} treatment programme {{for young people}} in Dublin who have developed personal, social, learning, economic and legal difficulties {{as a result of}} their use of heroin. This qualitative research inquiry examines the meaning of <b>drug</b> <b>treatment</b> in this project through the lens of adult and community education. The research methodology involved in-depth interviews, theatrical workshops and participative observation. The research looks critically at the discourses of medicine, therapy and education through which the Crinan Youth Project is constructed. Theatrical language is used at times to present the complexity of <b>drug</b> <b>treatment</b> as a drama and point of convergence between conflicting scripts, languages and discourses played out by the actors and stakeholders of <b>drug</b> <b>treatment.</b> The research found that this <b>drug</b> <b>treatment</b> drama is dominated by a medical discourse and the prescription of methadone. The medical discourse secures and maintains its powerful position in the <b>drug</b> <b>treatment</b> services through the concept of hegemony. Medicine through psychiatry has become a powerful institution and controlling influence in defining and shaping addiction and mental health services in Ireland. The research also found that psychotherapy supports this medical dominance in the treatment of addiction in return for its own script and central part in the drama of <b>drug</b> <b>treatment.</b> Furthermore the research highlights critically the position adopted by community development within the educational discourse in failing perceive or challenge this medical hegemony in <b>drug</b> <b>treatment.</b> What has developed as a result is a range of medical led services treating what is primarily a social problem, with a medical solution that is clearly not working. In this context vulnerable young people are construed as heroin addicts and prescribed methadone based solely a medical definition of addiction.
