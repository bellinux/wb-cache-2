5|$|McCormick {{increasingly}} {{resented the}} favours FitzRoy gave to assist Darwin with collecting. On 16 February, FitzRoy landed a small party including himself and Darwin on St. Paul's rocks, finding the seabirds so tame {{that they could}} be killed easily, while an exasperated McCormick was left circling the islets in a second small boat. That evening novices were <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> pseudo-Neptune, and in the morning they crossed the equator with the traditional line-crossing ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Project X {{held its}} world premiere on February 29, 2012, at the Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, {{followed}} by an after party with performances by Kid Cudi, Tyler, The Creator, and The Hundred in the Hands.

5|$|The Tjängvide image stone {{from the}} Baltic island of Gotland, Sweden {{features}} a rider on an eight-legged horse, {{which may be}} Odin's eight-legged horse Sleipnir, being <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> female, which may be a valkyrie at Valhalla. The 11th century runestone U 1163 features a carving of a female bearing a horn that has been interpreted as the valkyrie Sigrdrífa handing the hero Sigurd (also depicted on the stone) a drinking horn.|$|E

5|$|Abebe {{returned}} to his homeland a hero. He was <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> large crowd, many dignitaries and {{the commander of the}} Imperial Guard, Brigadier-General Mengistu Neway. Abebe was paraded through the streets of Addis Ababa along a procession route lined with thousands of people and presented to Emperor Haile Selassie. The emperor awarded him the Star of Ethiopia and promoted him to the rank of asiraleqa (corporal). He was given the use of a chauffeur-driven Volkswagen Beetle (since he did not yet know how to drive) and a home, both owned by the Guard.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the writer}} Branko Ćopić, who was a Partisan in Grmeč, Stojanović was <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> crowd of villagers and welcomed with the {{traditional}} bread and salt ceremony when he crossed the Sana River. Prominent villagers shook hands with him, and they compared him with Miloš Obilića famous Serbian epic hero from the medieval Battle of Kosovo. Several women approached Stojanović to kiss his hands; he declined this mark of respect, {{saying that he was}} not a priest but a communist.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} {{four thousand}} Beatles' fans were present on 7 February 1964 as Pan Am Flight 101 left Heathrow Airport. Among the passengers were the Beatles, {{on their first}} trip to the United States as a band, with their entourage of photographers and journalists, and Phil Spector. When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed JohnF.KennedyAirport, they were <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> second large crowd, with Beatles fans again estimated to number four thousand, and journalists, two hundred. From having so many people packed in a little space, a few people in the crowd got injured. The airport had not previously experienced such a large crowd.|$|E
50|$|Hiring {{people to}} applaud {{dramatic}} performances was common in classical times. For example, when the Emperor Nero acted, {{he had his}} performance <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> encomium chanted <b>by</b> five thousand of his soldiers.|$|R

5|$|Later in 1962, United States Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara visited South Vietnam and {{was taken}} on an {{inspection}} tour of the country, accompanied by Diệm and Thảo. Perhaps because Thảo divulged the tour details to Vietcong guerrillas, each of McNamara's stopovers was punctuated by bloody attacks on nearby ARVN installations. For example, when McNamara was in Bình Dương Province, five government soldiers were killed. As he flew from Đà Lạt north to Đà Nẵng near the Demilitarized Zone, he was <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Vietcong bombing of a southbound troop train, which killed 27 and wounded 30 Civil Guard members.|$|E
5|$|A {{local radio}} show {{schedules}} {{an interview with}} Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) to discuss Dunder Mifflin, but, unbeknown to Dwight, the interview is later canceled. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) suggests they all use this to their advantage, and stage an interview for Dwight's benefit. Dwight believes he is talking to the interviewer through {{the phone in the}} break room, but is actually talking to Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) who is using an American accent. They convince him that the information he is giving leads to a hostage situation with CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) cornered in his house. Dwight calls David and tries to talk him into surrendering to the police. David is confused but nonetheless responds in a way that leads Dwight to believe he was successful. He emerges from the break room and is <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> round of applause from his coworkers.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, {{seventeen}} {{people were}} indicted {{by a federal}} grand jury and five were found guilty of wilfully interfering with a marshal in performance of his duties (Braden, Patterson, Pryor, Purcell, and John J. Doyle, a leader in the Settler's League). They were convicted in federal court (with Judge Sawyer presiding) and sentenced to eight months in prison and fined $300 each. Their time spent in imprisonment was hardly difficult. Three of the men's wives were allowed to live with them, and Susan Curtis, daughter of one of the jailers, fell in love with and later married Braden. Upon their release in September 1881, they were <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> joyous crowd of 3,000 in Hanford. Such was the anti-railroad sentiment that the five were looked upon as heroes by many across California, and those killed were considered martyrs who had given their lives for a cause.|$|E
50|$|Series three: Ken {{walks into}} a {{building}} and is <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> old time camera. Suddenly we see Ken and other characters (Harry and Margaret) in a Wild West setting. Again we watch as Ken upon his motorcycle turn into a cowboy upon a horse.|$|R

5|$|As the two champions {{appeared}} {{they were}} <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> frenzy {{of excitement and}} everyone was on their feet to acclaim the two heroes. It was difficult to recognise them. Garin was first, followed by the mud-soaked figure of Cordang. Suddenly, to the stupefaction of everyone, Cordang slipped and fell on the velodrome's cement surface. Garin could not believe his luck. By the time Cordang was back on his bike, he had lost 100 metres. There remained six laps to cover. Two miserable kilometres in which to catch Garin. The crowd held its breath as they watched the incredible pursuit match. The bell rang out. One lap, there remained one lap. 333 metres for Garin, who had a lead of 30 metres on the Batave.|$|E
5|$|Phillips' and Arnold's {{pursuit of}} the {{retreating}} American militia continued to Manchester, just {{across the river from}} Richmond, which they reached on 29 April. However, they were unable to enter Richmond, as Lafayette had marched rapidly and occupied the city first. After destroying tobacco warehouses throughout Chesterfield County, the British sailed back down the James to Westover, while Lafayette advanced as far as Pocahontas. At Westover on 7 May, Phillips received orders to return to Petersburg and await Lord Cornwallis, who was moving north from Wilmington, North Carolina. Upon reaching Petersburg on 9 May, Phillips was <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> bombardment from Lafayette's artillery positioned north of the river in what is now Colonial Heights. General Phillips contracted typhoid fever and died on 13 May, leaving Arnold temporarily in command of the British force.|$|E
5|$|The {{second was}} a staged {{publicity}} event, {{suggested by the}} reporter Charles Lesne, which took place on Thursday 8 May 1930. During the stunt, the 15-year-old Lucien Pepermans, a friend of Hergé's who had Tintin's features, arrived at Brussels' Gare du Nord railway station aboard the incoming Liège express from Moscow, dressed in Russian garb as Tintin and accompanied by a white dog; in later life Hergé erroneously claimed that he had accompanied Pepermans. They were <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> crowd of fans, who mobbed Pepermans and pulled him into their midst. Proceeding by limousine to the offices of , they were greeted by further crowds, largely of Catholic Boy Scouts; Pepermans gave a speech on the building's balcony, before gifts were distributed to fans.|$|E
5000|$|The song {{tells the}} story of a woman from Austin's {{attempts}} to make contact with a former lover.

50|$|At the {{penultimate}} {{culmination of}} a multi-thousand year journey, Kaushika's yogic power is at a peak. At this point, Brahma, {{as the head of}} Devas led by Indra, names Kaushika a brahmarishi and names him Vishvamitra or Friend of All for his unlimited compassion. He then goes to meet Vashishta. It was customary that, if <b>a</b> sage was <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> equal or superior person, the sage would also greet the person. If the sage was <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> inferior person, the sage would simply bless them. Initially, when Vishwamitra greeted Vashista with the pride of being a new brahmarishi in heart, Vashishta simply blessed him. Suddenly all pride and desire left Vishwamitra's heart and he became a clean and clear brahmarishi. When Vishwamitra turned back to leave, Vashishta realised the change of heart and also greeted Vishwamitra. Vishwamitra is also embraced by Vashista and their enmity is instantly ended.|$|R
50|$|Kathy's father, Gordon, becomes {{suspicious}} of Johnny, and warns Kathy {{to stay away}} from him because they can't trust strangers. The next day, Kathy goes for a ride with Johnny against her father's wishes. They ride all over town, including a construction site. When they finally return home, they are <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> angry Gordon, who coldly warns Johnny {{to stay away from}} his daughter.|$|R
5|$|Their first match {{took place}} on 16 September 1905 against Devon, who had been runners-up {{in the most recent}} English county championship, and for whom played ten members of Devonport Albion, the top club in England. Because of this, Devon went into the match as favourites, however the crowd of 6,000 at the match were soon stunned by the New Zealanders as they scored 12 tries and {{eventually}} won 55–4. Billy Wallace scored 28 points, including three tries, and it would be another 51 years before another All Black would score more points in one match. The score caused a sensation in Britain, and some newspapers even incorrectly reported the score as Devon 55, New Zealand 4. Eventually the reports were corrected, and the New Zealanders returned to Newton Abbot to be <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> brass band and cheering crowd.|$|E
5|$|Wes and Rui {{then go to}} Realgam Tower. All four {{administrators are}} there and ready to face Wes again. After doing so, he is granted access to the Colosseum {{at the top of}} the building. There, he is <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> large crowd. A Cipher man named Nascour tells Wes that he will have to face four trainers. After Wes defeats all four trainers, Nascour fights him. Once defeated, Nascour tries to leave, only to be {{interrupted}} by Es Cade. Es Cade reveals that he is really none other than Evice, the head of Cipher, and battles Wes. When Wes defeats him, Evice attempts to escape by helicopter, but the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh swoops in and blasts it out of the sky. Evice and Nascour are presumably arrested.|$|E
5|$|In 1895 Bain first played {{competitive}} {{ice hockey}} when he answered a classified ad {{placed in a}} newspaper by the Winnipeg Victorias, who were looking for new players. Though he played with a broken stick held together by wire, Bain made the team only five minutes into the tryout. Bain quickly became a star centre and leader for the Victorias. This was proven during a February 14, 1896 game against the Montreal Victorias for the Stanley Cup, the trophy for the national hockey championship in Canada. It was a 2–0 victory for Winnipeg that gave them the Cup. This victory {{marked the first time}} a team outside of Quebec had won the trophy. The team was <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> huge crowd at the Canadian Pacific Railway station when their train, decorated with hockey sticks and the Union Jack, returned to Winnipeg. They were led to a feast in their honour in a parade of open sleighs, where fans gathered to celebrate the championship.|$|E
50|$|When the Viking's {{village is}} in sight, Herendethelessen tells his crewmembers {{to get ready}} to be covered with honors only for them to be <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> angry booming voice. Steptøånssen remarks that it is their fearsome chief Odiuscomparissen, to which Herendethelessen tells him that it {{certainly}} is not a mermaid — a reference to the statue The Little Mermaid in the port of Danish capital Copenhagen.|$|R
50|$|As delegates {{arrived at}} the December 4 convention, they were <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> {{enormous}} red and white billboard supporting Reierson and a rock band supporting Gerhart.

Party secretary Orvis Kennedy was trying to prevent a resolution in favour of the Social Credit youth branch, endorsing the legalization of marijuana from making the convention floor (he succeeded).|$|R
25|$|This period {{also saw}} growth in crowds in Australia, New Zealand and France. This was {{a golden age}} for the French, who led by the {{incomparable}} Puig Aubert, travelled to Australia and defeated their host in a three test series in 1951. On their return to France the victorious team were <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> estimated 100,000 fans in Marseille. They repeated the feat in France 1952–53 and again in Australia in 1955.|$|R
5|$|In July 1969, the {{prominent}} Luo politician Mboya was assassinated by a Kikuyu, with suspicions being voiced that Kenyatta's government had been responsible. The killing sparked riots in Nairobi, and ethnic tensions were stoked across Kenya. In October 1969, Kenyatta visited Kisumu, located in Luo territory, {{in order to}} open a hospital financed with Soviet aid. He was <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> crowd shouting KPU slogans and he lost his temper. When members of the crowd started throwing stones, Kenyatta's bodyguards opened fire on them, killing and wounding several. In response {{to the rise of}} KPU, Kenyatta had introduced oathing, a system in which individuals came to Gatundu to swear their loyalty to him. Journalists were discouraged from reporting on the oathing system, and several were deported when they tried to do so. Many were pressured or forced to conduct the oaths, generating a condemnation from the country's Christian establishment. In response to the growing condemnation, the oathing was terminated in September 1969, and Kenyatta invited leaders from other ethnic groups to a meeting in Gatundi.|$|E
5|$|Kalep took up {{flying in}} the late 1920s, when she met Dutch aviator Anthony Fokker while holidaying in St. Moritz {{and asked him to}} teach her to fly a plane. She {{completed}} five hours of flying with Fokker and, after breaking her arm during a sledding accident in the winter of 1931, took her pilot's test in Germany on 1 August 1931. She passed, becoming the first qualified female pilot from Estonia, and the seventh woman to pass the exam in Germany. Soon after receiving her license, Kalep and Valter Mayer, a German mechanic, co-piloted a small Klemm plane from Berlin through Eastern Europe, stopping in Szczecin, Gdańsk, Kaunas, Jelgava and Riga, finally landing in Tallinn on 18 August. Upon her arrival in Tallinn, Kalep was <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> crowd of journalists and officers of the Estonian Air Force; she briefly visited relatives in Nõmme before beginning her return journey to Amsterdam.|$|E
5|$|One year later, Crash {{is living}} with his younger sister Coco on N. Sanity Island, one of the islands owned by Cortex in the {{previous}} game. After Coco's laptop battery dies, she forces a sleeping Crash to get her a new one. While doing so, Crash is abducted by a bright light and finds himself in an old Warp Room hidden in Cortex's castle, where a holographic projection of Cortex instructs him to bring him the crystals by traveling through the Warp Room's doors. After Crash collects a crystal, Cortex informs Crash of the upcoming destructive force and assigns him the task of bringing all of the crystals to him so that he may contain it. After retrieving a gem, Crash is <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> hologram from Doctor Nitrus Brio, Cortex's former assistant from the previous game, who is now out to stop Cortex's plans for world domination. Brio explains that the Earth contains gems in addition to crystals, and that collecting 42 gems will allow Brio to fire a laser beam that can destroy the Cortex Vortex.|$|E

50|$|Croydon {{was where}} regular {{international}} passenger services began, initially using converted wartime bombers, and the Croydon-Le Bourget route soon became the busiest in the world.
