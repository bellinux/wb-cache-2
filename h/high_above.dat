5|$|After {{passing the}} site of Ty Dwr the railway bends around 'Amen' corner and soon after the Village Incline is reached. From here the line runs into the gorge, <b>high</b> <b>above</b> the river on a narrow ledge, ending {{at the foot of}} the first incline leading to the Bryn Eglwys quarry. The {{original}} line fanned out into a set of three sidings, used to marshal trains of loaded slate wagons coming down from the quarry and empty wagons waiting to ascend. Nant Gwernol station, the eastern terminus of the line, was built on {{the site of}} the sidings.|$|E
5|$|Just after half-time, Leicester City {{had their}} strongest scoring chance, when Andy Lochhead {{received}} a headed knockdown from Allan Clarke, but Lochhead's shot went <b>high</b> <b>above</b> the goal. A dominant period by Manchester City then followed, {{which included a}} chance for Colin Bell from a free-kick. Len Glover was forced to move into defence with his team under pressure, but was injured shortly afterward {{and had to be}} substituted. Defender Malcolm Manley came on in his place.|$|E
5|$|On 28 May 1848 a line opened between Irvine and Busbie, about 2miles (3km) north-west of Kilmarnock; a short {{branch to}} Irvine Harbour {{opened on the}} same day. The Cumnock line as far as Auchinleck and the Muirkirk branch from that point, opened on 9 August. This {{included}} the Ballochmyle Viaduct, located near Catrine; it was built with a central span of 181feet (55.2m) and 175feet (53.3m) <b>high</b> <b>above</b> the River Ayr. It was the largest masonry arch span {{in the world at}} the time of its completion, and is the highest railway bridge in Britain.|$|E

5|$|Rodgers {{had long}} {{wanted to write}} a musical comedy about the cast and crew {{backstage}} at a theatre. After Rodgers and Hammerstein had another hit with The King and I in 1951, Rodgers proposed the backstage project to his partner. Hammerstein was unenthusiastic, thinking the subject matter trivial, but agreed to do the project. The play required complex machinery, designed by Jo Mielziner, so that the audience could view action not only on the stage of the theatre where the show-within-the-show (also named Me and Juliet) takes place, but in the wings and on the light bridge (<b>high</b> <b>above</b> the stage, from which the lighting technicians train spotlights) as well.|$|E
5|$|Specialised {{football}} boots {{began to emerge}} in the professional era, taking the place of everyday shoes or work boots. Players initially simply nailed strips of leather to their boots to enhance their grip, leading the Football Association to rule in 1863 that no nails could project from boots. By the 1880s these crude attachments had become studs. Boots of this era were made of heavy leather, had hard toecaps, and came <b>high</b> <b>above</b> a player's ankles.|$|E
5|$|The B-52 {{contributed to}} Operation Enduring Freedom in 2001 (Afghanistan/Southwest Asia), {{providing}} {{the ability to}} loiter <b>high</b> <b>above</b> the battlefield and provide Close Air Support (CAS) {{through the use of}} precision guided munitions, a mission which previously would have been restricted to fighter and ground attack aircraft. In late 2001, ten B-52s dropped a third of the bomb tonnage in Afghanistan. B-52s also played a role in Operation Iraqi Freedom, which commenced on 20 March 2003 (Iraq/Southwest Asia). On the night of 21 March 2003, B-52Hs launched at least one hundred AGM-86C CALCMs at targets within Iraq.|$|E

5|$|The Commandos on Campbeltown now disembarked: two assault teams, five {{demolition}} {{teams with}} their protectors and a mortar group. Three demolition teams were tasked with destroying the dock pumping machinery and other installations {{associated with the}} dry dock. The kilt-wearing Captain Donald Roy – 'The Laird' – and his 14-man assault troop were tasked with knocking out two pump-house roof-top gun emplacements <b>high</b> <b>above</b> the quayside and securing a bridge to provide a route for the raiding parties to exit the dock area. Roy and Sgt Don Randall used scaling ladders and grenades to accomplish the former, and a head-on rush to secure the bridge and form a bridgehead that enabled Capt. Bob Montgomery and Lt Corran Purdon and their demolition teams to exit the area.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is set on}} the Wumpa Islands, a {{group of}} three fictional Australian islands owned by Doctor Neo Cortex. Levels are {{typically}} set in tribesmen's villages, fortresses or beaches. Some levels on the second island also take place in temple ruins, bridges <b>high</b> <b>above</b> the mountains, and a volcanic mine. Levels on the third island feature much more industrial settings, including a large power plant and a castle. The tropical setting of the game was inspired by Donkey Kong Country.|$|E
5|$|The {{illusion}} of endless rows of Klingons {{was created by}} brightly lighting the accused {{in the center of}} the room with a bright blue light, then letting the rest of the set fall into shadow. To give the set a larger appearance, a shot from <b>high</b> <b>above</b> the courtroom was created using miniatures. Inspired by a scene in Ben-Hur, matte supervisor Craig Barron used two hundred commercially available Worf dolls sent by Ralph Winter. Angry Klingons were created by rocking the dolls back and forth with motors, waving sticks lit by twelve-volt light bulbs dyed red. The resulting courtroom miniature was ten feet long.|$|E

5000|$|This {{means that}} a V (3 m) = 5-m/s (≈10-knot) wind at 3 m above the water would be {{approximately}} V (15 m) = 6 m/s (≈12 knots) at 15 m above the water. In hurricane-force winds with V (3 m) = 40-m/s (≈78 knots) the speed at 15 m would be V (15 m) = 49 m/s (≈95 knots) with p = 0.128. This suggests that sails that reach <b>higher</b> <b>above</b> the surface can be subject to stronger wind forces that move the centre of effort (CE [...] ) <b>higher</b> <b>above</b> the surface and increase the heeling moment.|$|R
50|$|The {{curvature}} of the earth means that a line of sight that is horizontal at the instrument will be <b>higher</b> and <b>higher</b> <b>above</b> a spheroid at greater distances. The effect may be significant for some work at distances under 100 meters.|$|R
5|$|This {{cockatoo}} usually lays {{a clutch}} of one to two eggs. It generally takes 28 to 29 days for the female to incubate the eggs, and the young fledge ten to eleven weeks after hatching. The young will stay with the family until the next breeding season, and sometimes even longer. The family leaves the nesting site after the young fledge until the following year. Carnaby's black cockatoo forms flocks when not breeding, with birds in drier habitats usually being more migratory than those in wetter ones. It flies with deep and slow wingbeats, generally <b>high</b> <b>above</b> trees. Seeds of plants of the families Proteaceae and, to a lesser extent, Myrtaceae form {{a large part of}} its diet.|$|E
5|$|After a mine cart chase {{to escape}} the temple, the trio emerge above ground and are again cornered by Mola Ram and his henchmen on a rope bridge <b>high</b> <b>above</b> a crocodile-infested river. Using a sword, Indy cuts the rope bridge in half, leaving {{everyone}} to hang on for their lives. Indy utters an incantation which causes the stones to glow red hot. Two of the stones fall into the river, while the last falls into Mola Ram's hand, burning his hand. Indy catches the now-cool stone, while Mola Ram falls into the river below and gets devoured by hungry crocodiles. The Thuggees then attempt to shoot Indy with arrows, until a company of British Indian Army riflemen, summoned by the Maharajah, arrive and open fire on the Thuggee archers. Indy, Willie, and Shorty return to the village with the children and give the missing stone back to the villagers.|$|E
5|$|At the Rio de Janeiro location, {{many months}} later, Roger Moore arrived {{several days later}} than {{scheduled}} for shooting due to recurrent health problems and an attack of kidney stones that he had suffered while in France. After arriving in Rio de Janeiro, Moore was immediately whisked off the plane and went straight to hair and make-up work, before re-boarding the plane, to film the sequence with him arriving as James Bond in the film. Sugarloaf Mountain was a prominent location in the film, and during filming of the cable car sequence in which Bond and Goodhead are attacked by Jaws during mid-air transportation <b>high</b> <b>above</b> Rio de Janeiro, the stuntman Richard Graydon slipped and narrowly avoided falling to his death. For the scene in which Jaws bites into the steel tramway cable with his teeth, the cable was actually made of liquorice, although Richard Kiel was still required to use his steel dentures.|$|E
50|$|At <b>higher</b> frequencies, usually <b>above</b> 500 MHz, traces get {{electrically}} {{longer and}} <b>higher</b> <b>above</b> the plane. Two techniques are used at these frequencies: wave shaping with series resistors and embedding the traces {{between the two}} planes. If all these measures still leave too much EMI, shielding such as RF gaskets and copper tape can be used. Most digital equipment is designed with metal or conductive-coated plastic cases.|$|R

50|$|The design {{intended}} the recoil forces to travel, {{along with the}} mass of the weapon's moving parts, in a direct line to the shoulder of the gunner. While this design minimized muzzle climb, the sights had to be placed <b>higher</b> <b>above</b> the bore.|$|R
5|$|Both German ships {{initially}} concentrated {{their fire}} on Hood and destroyed her with salvoes of 8- and 15-inch shells. An 8-inch shell hit the boat deck and struck a ready service locker for the UP rocket projectors, and a fire blazed <b>high</b> <b>above</b> the first superstructure deck. At 05:58 {{at a range}} of , the force commander ordered a turn of 20 degrees to port to open the range and bring the full battery of the British ships to bear on Bismarck. As the turn began, Bismarck straddled Hood with her third and fourth four-gun salvoes and at 06:01 the fifth salvo hit her, causing a large explosion. Flames shot up near Hoods masts, then an orange-coloured fireball and an enormous smoke cloud obliterated the ship. On Prince of Wales, it seemed that Hood collapsed amidships, and the bow and stern could be seen rising as she rapidly settled. Prince of Wales made a sharp starboard turn to avoid hitting the debris {{and in doing so}} further closed the range between her and the German ships. In the four-minute action, Hood, the largest battlecruiser in the world, had been sunk. 1,419 officers and men were killed. Only three men survived.|$|E
5|$|Jean-Michel Jarre {{was born}} in Lyon on 24 August 1948, to France Pejot, a French Resistance member and {{concentration}} camp survivor, and composer Maurice Jarre. When Jarre was five, his parents split up and his father moved to America, leaving him with his mother. He did not see his father again until reaching the age of 18. For the first eight years of his life, Jarre spent six months each year at his maternal grandparents' flat on the Cours de Verdun, in the Perrache district of Lyon. Jarre's grandfather was an oboe player, engineer and inventor, designing an early audio mixer used at Radio Lyon. He also gave Jean-Michel his first record player. From his vantage point <b>high</b> <b>above</b> the pavement, the young French boy was able to watch street performers at work, an experience he later cited as proving influential on his art.|$|E
5|$|Just {{north of}} the {{community}} of Hale the road enters the Huron National Forest near Loon Lake. The trunkline takes a turn to the east as it passes along the Au Sable River. The River Road National Scenic Byway starts on M-65 at Rollways Road, and the highway generally follows the river as it passes by a former logging community which is commemorated by Lumberman's Monument. At the intersection with River Road, M-65 turns north to cross the Au Sable, and the byway designation continues east along River Road to follow the river to Oscoda. The M-65 bridge over the Au Sable is just downstream of the Five Channels Dam, crossing <b>high</b> <b>above</b> the water below. The highway turns northwesterly through forest land to cross into Alcona County. North of the county line, the trunkline follows Baker and State roads near Vaughn and Hunters lakes. M-65 meets the western terminus of county road F-30 in the community of Glennie. The highway also crosses the South Branch of the Pine River.|$|E
