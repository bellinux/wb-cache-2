It contains [...] "slow breaks", that according to Jamil Ahmad of musicOMH, [...] "wrap this record round you like walking into an exclusive club with a million dollar sound system – you <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{going to have one}} of those nights".

500|$|Williams {{sings the}} lead vocals while Beyoncé and Rowland sing their {{respective}} solo verses {{and serve as}} background vocalists throughout the song. Eric Corpus from The Christian Post interpreted the song's lyrics as a praise of God's sovereignty and [...] "magnetism" [...] of Jesus' love. [...] "Say Yes" [...] opens with a message of faith as Williams sings the first lines, [...] "I'm not worried about a thing/'Cause I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> guiding me / Where you lead me / Lord I will go / I have not fear / 'Cause I know who's in control." [...] The chorus is constructed as a call and response with the trio repeatedly praising Jesus through the lines [...] "When Jesus say yes, nobody can say no!" [...] while being backed by a choir which repeats the verses.|$|E
500|$|Although not {{included}} in the Test squads to face either New Zealand or South Africa, White was named in the ODI and Twenty20 squads to face South Africa at home, and professed [...] "it was a good feeling to <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> still in the mix". White played in a more familiar role in the Twenty20s, batting in the middle-order, and after a disappointing 7 in the first match, made 40* off 18 in the second to push Australia's total up beyond South Africa's reach. He had a steady ODI series, in which he was again used as a middle-order batsman, and part-time spinner. [...] He retained his place for the one-day series against New Zealand, but had limited involvement, making 27runs from his two innings, though he did claim two wickets in his seven overs bowling.|$|E

500|$|On March 25, 1983, Jackson {{reunited with}} his {{brothers}} for a performance taped at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium for , an NBC television special. The show aired on May 16, 1983, to an estimated audience of , and featured the Jacksons and other Motown stars. It is best remembered for Jackson's solo performance of [...] "Billie Jean", which earned Jackson his first Emmy nomination. Wearing a distinctive black-sequined jacket and a golf glove decorated with rhinestones, he debuted his signature dance move, the moonwalk, which former Soul Train dancer and Shalamar member Jeffrey Daniel had taught him three years earlier. Jackson had originally turned down the invitation to perform at the show, believing {{he had been doing}} too much television at the time; at the request of Motown founder Berry Gordy, he agreed to perform in exchange for time to do a solo performance. According to Rolling Stone reporter Mikal Gilmore, [...] "There are times when you <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> hearing or seeing something extraordinary ... that came that night." [...] Jackson's performance drew comparisons to Elvis Presley's and the Beatles' appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show. Anna Kisselgoff of The New York Times wrote in 1988: [...] "The moonwalk that he made famous is an apt metaphor for his dance style. How does he do it? As a technician, he is a great illusionist, a genuine mime. His ability to keep one leg straight as he glides while the other bends and seems to walk requires perfect timing." [...] Gordy said of the performance: [...] "From the first beat of 'Billie Jean', I was mesmerized, and when he did his iconic moonwalk, I was shocked, it was magic, Michael Jackson went into orbit, and never came down." ...|$|E

Her sacrifice of her child to her wealthy relatives is compared to the biblical Hannah.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first level}} is [...] "The despair that is ignorant of being despair or the despairing ignorance {{of having a}} self and an eternal self." [...] Essentially this level is one which has the wrong {{conception}} of what a self is, i.e., is ignorant of how to realize the self one already potentially is. In this sense, the person does not recognize his own despair because he often measures {{the success of his}} life based on whether he himself judges himself to be happy. Regardless of whether you <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> in despair or not, Kierkegaard asserts, you can still be in that state. He notes that this is the most common in the world.|$|E
