5|$|Dodd {{continued}} campaigning <b>in</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire visiting up to {{four different}} cities in one day. Political commentator Bill O'Reilly slammed Dodd after he appeared on The O'Reilly Factor in August, characterizing him as a kool-aid drinker and blind follower of the far left. O'Reilly chastised Dodd and branded him a traitor for his perceived betrayal of fellow Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman during the 2006 Senatorial election.|$|E
5|$|He used a {{somewhat}} negative advertising campaign {{that seemed to}} have the intended initial effect of boosting him to serious contention. His 1988 campaign was based on the platform of supply-side economics and inner-city enterprise zones. In Bare Knuckles and Back Rooms: My Life in American Politics, campaign chairman Rollins described Kemp as a candidate with foibles. Kemp's campaign managers say he was unmanageable: he ignored timers on his speeches, refused to call contributors, and refused to practice for debates. A humbling Super Tuesday, in which his 39delegate total was fewer than eventual nominee and President Bush and both Dole and Pat Robertson, ended his campaign. After withdrawing from the race, he was still considered a contender for the Vice President nomination. In 1989, the Kemps switched their official residence from Hamburg, New York to Bethesda, Maryland, their residence {{at the time of his}} death. In 1994, Kemp's 1988 campaign reached a settlement with the Federal Election Commission by agreeing to pay $120,000 in civil penalties for 1988 campaign election law violations for, among other things, excessive contributions, improper direct corporate donations, press overbilling, exceeding spending limits <b>in</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire, and failure to reimburse corporations for providing air transportation.|$|E
25|$|Romney was {{the first}} {{candidate}} in the 2008 election to begin airing TV and radio advertisements, beginning in February 2007. His advertisements, most of which focus primarily on Romney's conservative credentials, have aired mainly <b>in</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire, which experts credit with helping his early lead in those and other early primary states. Romney's campaign advisors explained that their early advertisement push was {{to make up for}} Romney being relatively unknown compared to contenders Rudy Giuliani, John McCain, and Fred Thompson. On September 4, 2007, Romney was estimated to have spent $2 million in advertisements <b>in</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire.|$|E
50|$|Schjeldahl {{was born}} in Fargo, North Dakota. He grew up in small towns {{throughout}} Minnesota, and attended Carleton College <b>and</b> The <b>New</b> School. He began his professional writing career as a reporter <b>in</b> Minnesota, <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Jersey.|$|R
50|$|By November 2007, Richardson {{was still}} {{struggling}} to escape the second tier of Democratic candidates, although upticks in his poll numbers <b>in</b> first-voting <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire led to speculation {{that he might be}} able to overtake stalled third-place runner John Edwards, especially in the latter state.|$|R
50|$|Almost immediately, similar {{statutes}} {{were passed}} <b>in</b> North Dakota, <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> York, granting state jurisdiction over most offenses committed by or against Indians in Indian country.|$|R
25|$|Most of the {{candidates}} started their campaigns in mid-2011, but after the first two primaries <b>in</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire, only four well-funded campaigns (Romney, Gingrich, Santorum, and Paul) remained for the Republican Party nomination; Gary Johnson had withdrawn to run on the Libertarian ticket, and Buddy Roemer sought the American Elect nomination. At the beginning of May, Gingrich and Santorum suspended their campaigns; Romney was widely reported as the presumptive nominee, with Paul the only other major candidate running an active campaign.|$|E
500|$|Bayh {{continued}} to campaign <b>in</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire as November 2005 approached. Media outlets reported that 10 potential presidential candidates had visited Iowa in October. When {{asked about the}} attention given to the state 26 {{months prior to the}} caucus, Bayh replied that he [...] "wish the process didn't begin this early, but it does". Later in the month, former chief counsel and master political strategist for Bayh, Federal District Judge David Hamilton ruled that prayer could not be conducted prior to the opening of the state legislature in Indiana, reasoning that the mention of [...] "Jesus Christ" [...] as [...] "Savior" [...] or [...] "Son of God" [...] is unconstitutional. Commentators argued that the decision diminished Bayh's label as the [...] "centrist candidate" [...] for the Democratic nomination due to his connections to the judge.|$|E
500|$|Colbert's {{timing was}} too late for his name to be added the South Carolina primary ballot, and South Carolina law would not allow for {{write-in}} candidates. [...] Polling showed that 21% of the potential Republican primary electorate reported they would be [...] "more likely" [...] to vote for former candidate Herman Cain, who remained on the ballot, if that vote served as encouragement for Colbert. Herman Cain received 6,338 votes in the South Carolina Republican Primary, which was more than all the other withdrawn candidates received combined. On the next episode of The Colbert Report broadcast on January 23, 2012, Colbert boasted about passing the 1% threshold and for Cain receiving many more votes in South Carolina than <b>in</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire. Colbert then announced that he would no longer be exploring a run for President of the United States of South Carolina.|$|E
2500|$|In the January 3 Iowa caucus, {{the first}} contest {{of the primary}} elections, Romney {{received}} 25% of the vote and placed second to Mike Huckabee, who received 34%. The result was seen as disappointing as Romney spent about five {{times more than the}} former Arkansas governor <b>in</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> had banked on wins <b>in</b> both <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire to propel him to an overall victory. [...] Twelve of Iowa's delegates were awarded to Romney for his second-place finish.|$|R
5000|$|All states except Louisiana, Mississippi, <b>New</b> Jersey <b>and</b> Virginia held {{elections}} for their state legislatures. [...] Republicans made substantial gains in state legislatures across the nation. Twenty chambers flipped from Democratic to Republican control, giving Republicans {{full control of}} eleven state legislatures and control of one chamber <b>in</b> Colorado, <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> York.1 Additionally, Republicans gained enough seats in the Oregon House to produce a 30-30 party split, pushing Democrats into a power-sharing agreement {{that resulted in the}} election of two [...] "co-speakers" [...] (one from each party) to lead the chamber.|$|R
5000|$|Porter grew up <b>in</b> Utah, <b>Iowa,</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> York <b>and</b> {{attended}} Brigham Young High School in Provo, Utah. He attended Brigham Young University (BYU) for {{two years}} and {{was a member of the}} varsity men's tennis team before serving a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the United Kingdom. [...] He received his B.A. from BYU and was selected as a Rhodes Scholar and a Woodrow Wilson Fellow earning a B.Phil. from Oxford University. He earned his M.A. and Ph.D. from Harvard University.|$|R
2500|$|Romney, on September 5, 2007, began {{advertising}} in South Carolina, the early primary state {{where he was}} doing the poorest. During the second week of September, he expanded his advertising to Florida, showing the [...] "Energy" [...] ad which he debuted <b>in</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire and also began showing in South Carolina. The ad features Romney jogging and highlights his career as governor of Massachusetts, running the Salt Lake Olympics, and the private sector.|$|E
2500|$|Some critics, {{including}} Romney, {{have accused}} Huckabee of using his religion background for political advantage. A Romney campaign staff member {{pointed out that}} similar ads <b>in</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire are different in that the New Hampshire ad {{did not include the}} term [...] "Christian Leader" [...] in the spot, while an ad in Iowa did. Alice Stewart, a spokeswomen of the Huckabee campaign later said there was no intention to downplay religion in New Hampshire, noting the ads [...] "were simply different spots running in different markets, which is typical in presidential campaigns." ...|$|E
2500|$|In mid-August 2007, Romney began {{broadcasting}} advertisements <b>in</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire that criticized what {{he called}} the sanctuary city policies of several cities. [...] "Immigration laws don't work if they're ignored. [...] That's the problem with cities like Newark, San Francisco and New York City that adopt amnesty policies." [...] He went on to say, [...] "Sanctuary cities become magnets that encourage illegal immigration and undermine secure borders." [...] The New York Daily News termed the ad a [...] "thinly veiled attack on GOP presidential rival Rudy Giuliani who is competing for conservatives who want a crackdown on illegal immigration." ...|$|E
50|$|Throughout the {{primaries}} and caucuses, Richardson lagged behind fellow Democrats in polling data. Despite campaigning heavily in early {{states such as}} <b>Iowa,</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire, <b>and</b> Nevada, Richardson continued to barely register in polls. Richardson competed only <b>in</b> the <b>Iowa</b> caucuses <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire primary due to his withdrawal prior to caucuses in Nevada.|$|R

50|$|On August 30, 2013, a {{deal was}} {{announced}} in which Cumulus Media would swap its stations <b>in</b> Dubuque, <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> Poughkeepsie, <b>New</b> York (including WKNY) to Townsquare Media in exchange for Peak Broadcasting's Fresno, California stations. The deal is part of Cumulus' acquisition of Dial Global; Townsquare, Peak, and Dial Global are all controlled by Oaktree Capital Management. The transaction was consummated effective November 14, 2013.|$|R
2500|$|On December 9, 2003, former Vice President Al Gore {{endorsed}} Dean for the nomination. Speaking in Harlem, the Democratic Party's previous nominee said, [...] "I'm {{very proud}} and honored to endorse Howard Dean {{to be the}} next president of the United States of America ... In a field of great candidates, one candidate clearly now stands out, and so I'm asking all of you to join in this grassroots movement to elect Howard Dean." [...] Gore's endorsement was highly coveted, and CNN reported that it [...] "could cement Dean's status as the leading Democratic candidate heading into the kickoff contests now just weeks away <b>in</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire." ...|$|E
2500|$|With {{different}} winners <b>in</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire - and Mitt Romney {{taking the}} lower-profile Wyoming caucus - the January 15 Michigan primary loomed {{as an important}} battle. Polls after New Hampshire showed a tight race between McCain and Romney, with Huckabee a close third. [...] Many saw Michigan as Romney's last chance for a campaign-saving win after disappointments {{in the first two}} races. [...] Others said that a win in Michigan could cement McCain's status as the [...] "front-runner" [...] for the nomination. [...] McCain's campaign garnered about $1 million in newly contributed funds immediately after the New Hampshire win, but still had $3.5 million in bank debt.|$|E
2500|$|After {{a series}} of poor results <b>in</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire, Bush spent his {{remaining}} money and campaign effort on the South Carolina primary. He placed fourth with under 8% of the vote. That night, Bush suspended his campaign, ending his presidential bid, and subsequently endorsed Texas Senator Ted Cruz. [...] In an analysis of what went wrong, POLITICO argues that:"His slow, awkward stumble from August through October encapsulates everything that caused the operation viewed as [...] "Jeb!, Inc." [...] to fail. Bush was {{on the wrong side}} of the most galvanizing issues for Republican primary voters, he himself was a rusty and maladroit campaigner and his campaign was riven by internal disagreements and a crippling fear that left them paralyzed and unable to react to Trump." ...|$|E
50|$|The 2008 presidential {{campaign}} of Bill Richardson, New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson announced his candidacy on January 21, 2007, for President of the United States on ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos, {{by virtue of}} forming a presidential exploratory committee.Richardson, who is of Hispanic descent, joined a diverse field for the Democratic nomination, which already included an African American in Senator Barack Obama of Illinois and a female in Senator Hillary Clinton of <b>New</b> York <b>and</b> became the first individual of Hispanic descent to mount a nationwide campaign for president.

2500|$|On June 25, 2007, {{five days}} {{before the end of}} the second quarter of {{fundraising}} on June 30, Romney announced that he was again lending his campaign a significant amount of money. [...] He declined to say how much the second contribution would be, but that it was needed in order to run more advertising in battleground states. He said, [...] "It would be nice not to have to loan or contribute to your own campaign... If other people are making sacrifices, I sure have to as well. It’s not a dream come true. In some respects, it’s kind of a nightmare to write checks from your own bank account." [...] Romney asserted that his campaign had already spent $3 million on television advertising <b>in</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire since February 2007.|$|E
2500|$|With {{different}} winners <b>in</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire - and Mitt Romney {{taking the}} lower-profile Wyoming caucus - the January 15 Michigan primary loomed {{as an important}} battle, despite the state's delegation size being cut in half for holding the primary too early. Polls after New Hampshire showed a tight race between McCain and Romney, with Huckabee a close third. Many saw Michigan as Romney's last chance for a campaign-saving win after disappointments {{in the first two}} races. Others said that a win in Michigan could cement McCain's status as the [...] "front-runner" [...] for the nomination. McCain's campaign garnered about $1 million in newly contributed funds immediately after the New Hampshire win, but still had $3.5 million in bank debt. He was not alone in feeling a financial pinch; the entire Republican field suffered from a lack of enthusiasm and lower donations than the Democratic candidates were receiving.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Michigan {{moved its}} primary to January 15, 2008, also in {{violation}} of party rules. In October 2007, Obama, Richardson, Biden, and Edwards withdrew their names from the Michigan primary ballot, {{under pressure from the}} DNC and voters <b>in</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire. Kucinich unsuccessfully sought to remove his name from the ballot, whereas Clinton and Dodd opted to remain on the ballot. In December 2007, the DNC ruled that Michigan's 128pledged delegates and 29superdelegates would not count in the nominating contest unless it were held on a later date. The Michigan Democratic party responded with a press release noting that the primary would proceed with Clinton, Dodd, Gravel, and Kucinich on the ballot. Supporters of Biden, Edwards, Richardson, and Obama were urged to vote [...] "uncommitted" [...] instead of writing in their candidates' names because write-in votes for those candidates would not be counted.|$|E

50|$|Six states saw both {{chambers}} switch from Democrat to Republican majorities: Alabama (where the Republicans won a majority {{for the first}} time in 136 years), Maine ({{for the first time}} since 1964), Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina (for the first time since 1896), and Wisconsin. In addition, by picking up the lower chambers in Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Montana and Pennsylvania, Republicans gained control of {{both chambers}} in an additional five states. Further, Republicans picked up one chamber from Democrats <b>in</b> Colorado, <b>Iowa,</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> York to split control in those states. They expanded majorities in both chambers in Texas, Florida, and Georgia. The massive Republican victories in legislative races would be widely expected to have a major impact on the redrawing of Congressional districts for the 2012 election cycle.|$|R

5000|$|In the mid-1920s, {{automobile}} associations {{continued to}} sponsor their named routes — there were 64 such named routes <b>in</b> <b>Iowa</b> — {{on top of}} the route numbers given by the state highway commission. This proved to be more confusing than helpful to the casual traveler, so in 1924, the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO, later AASHTO) called for a national system of interstate highways. Of the 75,884 mi proposed by AASHO, nearly 3000 mi were allocated to Iowa. [...] Support for the system was unanimous <b>in</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>and</b> the <b>new</b> national routings <b>and</b> route numbers were assigned <b>in</b> 1925. The <b>Iowa</b> State Highway Commission chose to renumber a few highways as to not have conflicting route numbers along important routes. U.S. Highway 34 was designated along Primary Road No. 8, which was the Blue Grass Route. [...] Once the U.S. Highway System was established, the automobile association-sponsored roads gradually disappeared.|$|R
