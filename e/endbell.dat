50|$|Some who {{attempted}} to bend the rules were not lucky such as at the 1993 Worlds; the electric motor of Ben Sturnham's Schumacher CAT 2000 was found with a hybrid motor illegal under IFMAR regulation regardless if it was compliant with the host country BRCA's regulations, his Tanaplan motor consisted of parts by other manufacturer of approved motors including Epic can and armature with Yokomo <b>endbell.</b> Sturnham had his 3rd-place finish demoted to a 10th place after all his lap times was removed despite protests by Tanaplan's Martin Finnesey that it offered no performance enhancement.|$|E
50|$|The truck, {{available}} {{only as a}} kit, comes equipped with twin 540-J size sealed <b>endbell</b> stock motors wired in parallel when using the standard mechanical speed control. The motors feed power through a closed gear-reduction transmission terminating in a single dual-end output shaft which subsequently turn metal telescoping driveshafts running to each axle. The two axles feature the additional bracing and updated gear arrangement and specifications of the Juggernaut 2 truck which improve durability and lifespan while reducing the chance of gear misalignment under large torque loads. The 12mm hex {{at the end of}} each axle shaft keys into a widened 5-hole hub akin to the Clod Buster hub to increase track width. Main stress-bearing internal gear shafts in the transmission and axles are supported by metal shielded bearings, while the rest of the gears in the truck spin on metal bushings.|$|E
40|$|Quickly {{attaching}} joint used in {{variety of}} truss structures. Split ring made {{in one piece}} and split radially after final machining. Mating tapers on split ring and <b>endbells</b> small: approximately 7 degrees. Tapers of this range permit high internal preloads to be obtained, yet parts easily separated when collar released. Results from tests on developmental model indicate load-displacement response linear and substantial preloading accomplished. Quickly-erecting truss structures have variety of applications, from Earth to space-station keel beams, antenna masts, and large platforms...|$|R
