2500|$|Cryptography [...] is the {{practice}} and study of techniques for secure communication {{in the presence of}} third parties (called adversaries).

2500|$|Cryptography or {{cryptology}} (from Greek [...] kryptós, [...] "hidden, secret"; and [...] graphein, [...] "writing", or [...] -logia, [...] "study", respectively) is {{the practice}} and study of techniques for secure communication {{in the presence of}} third parties called adversaries. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages; various aspects in information security such as <b>data</b> <b>confidentiality,</b> data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation are central to modern cryptography. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, electrical engineering, communication science, and physics.

The Bell–LaPadula model is built on the concept of a state machine with a set of allowable states in a computer system. The transition from one state to another state is defined by transition functions.|$|E

Since cloud computing is rest on internet, security issues like privacy, <b>data</b> security, <b>confidentiality,</b> efficiency and authentication problems are encountered. <b>Data</b> Security, <b>confidentiality</b> and Authentication are the major problems in cloud computing. This paper analyzes the security vulnerabilities of most popular cryptography algorithms such as AES, DES, Triple DES, Blowfish and Hashing algorithms like MD 2, MD 5, SHA- 1, and SHA- 2.

The shuffled data provides a high level of data utility and minimizes the risk of disclosure. From a practical perspective, data shuffling overcomes reservations about using perturbed or modified confidential data because it retains all the desirable properties of perturbation methods and performs better than other masking techniques in both data utility and disclosure risk. In addition, data shuffling can be implemented using only rank-order data, and thus provides a nonparametric method for masking. We illustrate the applicability of data shuffling for small and large <b>data</b> sets. camouflage, <b>confidentiality,</b> <b>data</b> masking, data swapping, obfuscation, privacy, perturbation...|$|R
