40|$|Typically {{we think}} that we own our ideas but really, they tend to own us. To have ideas is seen as {{distinctly}} human: H. G. Wells (1920) states that "Human history is in essence a history of ideas". Management history can be depicted as a history of management ideas (Hamel, 2007). Ideas are generally thought as opinions, beliefs or convictions, intuitions or plans and schemes. 2 A typical managerial representation of ideas is objects of aspiration or thought we can manipulate and create at will (e. g. Kelley, 2001, Dodgson et al, 2008). They have an unfinished quality: in order to have (commercial or material) value, ideas need to be elaborated on and realized as products or activities. Ideas are thus commonly viewed as instruments in the hands of managers and organizations, and they are owned by these. Humans are in charge, they can adopt and jettison ideas on their discretion, and they can patent or copyright certain ideas. <b>Even</b> <b>when</b> <b>ideas</b> such as lean manufacturing or time management fundamentally shape management thinking and practice, ideas are seen as subservient to the managerial actor. A typical description of the relationship depicts the manager as the dominant partner and the idea only as the manager’s appliance. We see that disparagement unfair to ideas. In this paper we argue that there is value of seeing ideas as (more) equal to humans (see Figure 1). Ideas often control and affect managers deeply. Ideas shape organizational behavior and they tend to stick around (Stinchcombe, 1965). Thus more appropriately, ideas can be seen as social entities in 2 a.

50|$|Many {{public high}} schools provide for a school-funded newspaper, most often {{the product of a}} journalism class taken for credit. As a recent Legal News Advisory issued by the California Department of Education noted, these {{newspapers}} exist mainly to teach students the elements of journalism and to supplement the language arts curriculum. However, the same advisory also noted that students have a legitimate interest in the full expression of their own ideas on topics of concern, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> those <b>ideas</b> are in conflict with or are critical of those of the school or the majority of the public. Following the landmark Supreme Court ruling in Tinker v. Des Moines, which asserted that students do not lose their free speech protections in school, students are allowed a degree of freedom of expression in school, even if these rights are justifiably less than those experienced out of the classroom.|$|R

40|$|From the {{inception}} of American jurisprudence, an individual’s right to {{freedom of speech and}} expression guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution has been given some of the strongest protection available. The most celebrated legal minds in American history have consistently advocated the necessity of an open and honest exchange of ideas as fundamental to democratic society, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> the <b>ideas</b> expressed may be unpopular or of little value. Nonetheless, it is equally well-established that not all speech is protected, particularly where the speech in question poses a threat to public order. Although First Amendment law continues to evolve, the media available to Americans wishing to express their ideas seem to be evolving exponentially faster, particularly in the forum provided by the Internet.

40|$|Sketching {{and drawing}} are {{valuable}} tools for communi-cating conceptual and spatial information. When peo-ple communicate spatial ideas with each other, drawings and diagrams are highly effective because they lighten work-ing memory load and make spatial inference easier (Larkin and Simon 1987). Visual representations {{may also be}} helpful for communicating abstract <b>ideas,</b> <b>even</b> <b>when</b> those <b>ideas</b> are not literally about space (for example, reasoning about prob-ability [Cheng 2011]). Essentially, drawings provide external-ized symbol systems that facilitate spatial reasoning, which {{can be applied to}} a variety of domains. Sketching is especially useful for learning and instruction in spatially rich subjects, like science, technology, engineer-ing, and mathematics (that is, STEM fields). For science edu-cation, sketching can be used to increase engagement, improve learning, and encourage encoding across different representations (Ainsworth, Prain, and Tytler 2011). Drawing and sketching have the potential to play critical roles in sci-ence education, especially considering the importance of spa-tial skills in STEM disciplines. Data from more than 50 years of psychological research indicate that spatial skills are stable predictors of success in STEM fields (Wai, Lubinski, and Ben-bow 2009).

60|$|Lord Cashel was a {{man about}} sixty-three, with {{considerable}} external dignity of appearance, though without any personal advantage, either in face, figure, or manner. He had been an earl, with a large income, for thirty years; {{and in that time}} he had learned to look collected, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> his <b>ideas</b> were confused; to keep his eye steady, and to make a few words go a long way. He had never been intemperate, and was, therefore, strong and hale for his years,--he had not done many glaringly foolish things, and, therefore, had a character for wisdom and judgment. He had run away with no man's wife, and, since his marriage, had seduced no man's daughter; he was, therefore, considered a moral man. He was not so deeply in debt as to have his affairs known to every one; and hence was thought prudent. And, as he lived in his own house, with his own wife, paid his servants and labourers their wages regularly, and nodded in church for two hours every Sunday, he was thought a good man. Such were his virtues; and by these negative qualities--this vis inertiæ, he had acquired, and maintained, a considerable influence in the country.|$|R
40|$|Teaching Design IdeationAbstractA {{continuous}} {{challenge for}} engineering students is to generate creative designs. Many times,creative outcomes {{can be traced}} to idea generation; however, engineering students struggle togenerate multiple ideas (Cross, 2001) and become attached to first <b>ideas,</b> <b>even</b> <b>when</b> they realizethose <b>ideas</b> have serious flaws or challenges (Ball et al., 1994; Rowe, 1987; Ullman et al., 1988). <b>Even</b> <b>when</b> students suggest creative ideas, they do not use a specific strategy that can help themexplore the larger potential solution space, limiting their ability to suggest alternative creativesolutions. The challenge for engineering educators, on the other hand, is how to teach students creativity inengineering design courses. Based on advanced student and practitioner data from engineeringand industrial design, we developed design strategies to support diverse and creative conceptsduring initial idea generation for the design of products. We call these strategies “designheuristics,” because, once integrated into a designer’s ideation process, they serve as cognitiveshortcuts for creative, multiple, and diverse idea generation. In this study, we provided a brief educational session about the design heuristics toapproximately 100 students in an introductory engineering course, and analyzed their designconcepts as a result of heuristic use. This paper demonstrates example outcomes of thoseconcepts, along with a discussion of the creativity and diversity of their ideas, and a comparisonto some example concepts for the same design problem that were generated without the use ofheuristics...|$|R

40|$|December 2001 We provide {{evidence}} that private forecasters and {{the staff of the}} Federal Reserve use different forecasting models to predict inflation and GNP growth and heterogeneity of forecasting models is the norm in the market place. We thus argue that neither the Fed nor commercial forecasters know the "true" model of the economy. We demonstrate that their forecast errors are correlated with information available at the time when the forecasts were made and hence, by studying the systematic patterns of these forecast errors, we can deduce a great deal about their assessments of economic conditions in general and their view of monetary policy in particular. We also show that (i) although all private forecasters have the same information, their diverse forecasting models result in a distribution of forecasts which fluctuates over time. The distribution shows no tendency for convergence. The "consensus" median forecaster is a random member whose identity changes over time; (ii) the evidence shows that at any date there is a whole set of private forecasts who agree with the Fed's forecasts but the Fed forecasts are less volatile than the volatility of private forecasts measured by the variance of the cross-sectional distribution of private forecasts; (iv) diverse assessments of the impact of monetary policy on inflation and growth are important factors which contribute to the heterogeneity of forecasts. A surprising result reveals that although there is strong evidence for heterogeneity among forecasters, we also find similarity in qualitative patterns of forecast errors of all participants, including the Fed. Qualitative similarity implies similarity in the basic ideas underlying the forecasting models <b>even</b> <b>when</b> these <b>ideas</b> are wrong. This implies a degree of correlation among the subjective beliefs of divergent agents in the economy. (v) although all forecasts violate the standard orthogonality conditions of Rational Expectations, we argue in this paper that this should not be interpreted as irrational behavior. We provide an introduction to the theory of Rational Belief (see Kurz (1994), (1997)) and demonstrate that in contrast to the rejection of Rational Expectations, the pattern of estimated parameters is consistent with the predictions of the theory of Rational Beliefs (see Kurz (1994), (1997)). In opposition to some (e. g. De Bondt and Thaler (1985), (1990)), we argue that rejection of rational expectations should not be interpreted to imply irrational behavior. Working Papers Index...|$|R
