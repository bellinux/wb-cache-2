So that SNM varies with each cell operation, a thorough analysis of SNM <b>in</b> <b>read</b> mode is required. In this paper we investigate the SRAM cell SNM during read operations analyzing various alternatives to improve cell stability in this mode. The techniques studied are based on transistor width, and word- and bit-line voltage modulations.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the study was to examine the {{relationship}} of Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN) to cognitive, linguistic, and basic reading skills (word/nonword reading). Concurrent relationships among RAN, Phonological Awareness (PA), Verbal Short-Term Memory (STM), Processing Speed (PS), Letter Knowledge (LK) and Early Reading Skills (<b>READ)</b> were examined <b>in</b> 133 first- and second-grade children. The sample consisted of students who demonstrated a variety of reading skills. Causal models of RAN and Basic Reading skills were developed. The proposed direct and indirect relationships among variables were examined and appropriateness of the path models was tested through path analyses. Path analyses revealed that RAN digits/letters (RAN-DL) and PA were important and independent predictors of READ at each grade level. The findings demonstrated that RAN-DL had an increasingly predictive role <b>in</b> <b>READ,</b> whereas the importance of PA relatively diminished in the second grade. LK had a consistent predictive role <b>in</b> <b>READ</b> <b>in</b> both grades, whereas STM and PS had changing direct and indirect roles <b>in</b> <b>READ</b> <b>in</b> both grades. RAN objects (RAN-OBJ) had no significant role <b>in</b> <b>READ</b> at either grade level. Results indicated that STM and LK made significant contributions to RAN-DL and RAN-OBJ in the first grade; however, PS explained significant variance in only RAN-OBJ. PA did not explain any significant variance in RAN-DL and RAN-OBJ at either grade level. Interestingly, none of these four variables contributed to RAN-DL and RAN-OBJ in the second grade...|$|R
40|$|Recently we {{proposed}} a novel method to explicitly model the phone deletion phenomenon in speech, and introduced the context-dependent fragmented word model (CD-FWM). An evaluation on the WSJ 1 Hub 2 5 K task shows that even <b>in</b> <b>read</b> speech, CD-FWM could reduce word error rate (WER) by a relative 10. 3 %. Since it is generally expected that the phone deletion phenomenon is more pronounced in conversational and spontaneous speech than <b>in</b> <b>read</b> speech, we extend our investigation of modeling phone deletion in conversation using CD-FWM on the SVitchboard 500 -word task in this paper. To our surprise, much smaller recognition gain is obtained. Through a series of analyses, we present some plausible explanations for why phone deletion modeling is more successful <b>in</b> <b>read</b> speech than <b>in</b> conversational speech, and suggest future directions in improving CD-FWM for recognizing conversational speech. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R
