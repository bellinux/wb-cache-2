5|$|After seeing Nankiwi in the plane, a {{small group}} of Huaorani decided to make the trip to Palm Beach, and left the {{following}} morning, January 7. On the way, they encountered Nankiwi and the girl, returning unescorted. The girl's brother, Nampa, was furious at this, and to defuse the situation and divert attention from himself, Nankiwi claimed that the foreigners had attacked them on the beach, and in their haste to flee, they had been separated from their chaperone. Gikita, {{a senior member of the}} group whose experience with outsiders <b>had</b> <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> that they could not be trusted, recommended that they kill the foreigners. The return of the older woman and her account of the friendliness of the missionaries was not enough to dissuade them, and they soon continued toward the beach.|$|E
5|$|Sir Ralph David Richardson (19 December 1902– 10 October 1983) was an English actor who, {{along with}} his contemporaries John Gielgud and Laurence Olivier, {{dominated}} the British stage of the mid-20th century. He worked in films throughout most of his career, and played more than sixty cinema roles. From an artistic but not theatrical background, Richardson had had no thought of a stage career until a production of Hamlet in Brighton inspired him to become an actor. He learned his craft in the 1920s with a touring company and later the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. In 1931 he joined the Old Vic, playing mostly Shakespearean roles. He led the company the following season, succeeding Gielgud, who <b>had</b> <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> much about stage technique. After he left the company, a series of leading roles took him to stardom in the West End and on Broadway.|$|E
5|$|Following the family's move to England, Armstrong's father's {{eyesight}} failed further due to retinitis pigmentosa. By that time, {{there were}} ten {{children in the}} Armstrong family. After his younger sister, Louise, died from sudden infant death syndrome, his mother left the family to live with another woman. Armstrong subsequently {{spent much of his}} youth in various children's homes, and was a serial truant from school. His mother <b>had</b> <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> to shoplift as a child, and he was involved in petty crime throughout his youth in Manchester. At nine years old, he began training at Brian Hughes' Collyhurst and Moston Boys' Club. He also played football for a local North Manchester team until the club received so many fines for Armstrong's fighting on the pitch that they were unable to pay them. At this point, he stopped playing football to concentrate on his training in the ring. During his time in the children's home Armstrong met Alison, who has remained his companion (and later his wife) throughout his professional career; they were parents by the time Armstrong was 17.|$|E

So it is, and so let it be: for so it is well, and so I am safe, sinner and rebel though I be.|$|R
5|$|In Ratner's view, {{the most}} {{important}} of Saint-Saëns's chamber works are the sonatas: two for violin, two for cello, and one each for oboe, clarinet and bassoon, all seven with piano accompaniment. The First Violin Sonata dates from 1885, and is rated by Grove's Dictionary as one of the composer's best and most characteristic compositions. The Second (1896) signals a stylistic change in Saint-Saëns's work, with a lighter, clearer sound for the piano, characteristic of his music from then onwards. The First Cello Sonata (1872) was written after the death of the composer's great-aunt, who <b>had</b> <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> to play the piano more than thirty years earlier. It is a serious work, in which the main melodic material is sustained by the cello over a virtuoso piano accompaniment. Fauré called it the only cello sonata from any country to be of any importance. The Second (1905) is in four movements, and has the unusual feature of a theme and variations as its scherzo.|$|E

25|$|Despite his racism, Lashley {{has done}} some {{important}} work in neuropsychology and influenced his students to reach even greater heights. His works and theories that follow are summarized in his book Brain Mechanisms and Intelligence. Lashley's theory of the Engram was the driving force {{for much of his}} research. An engram was believed {{to be a part of}} the brain where a specific memory was stored. He continued to use the training/ablation method that Franz <b>had</b> <b>taught</b> <b>him.</b> He would train a rat to learn a maze and then use systematic lesions and removed sections of cortical tissue to see if the rat forgot what it had learned.|$|E
25|$|In 1858 Jules Perrot {{retired to}} his native France, never to return to Russia again. Petipa {{anticipated}} succeeding Perrot as premier maître de ballet. His years of serving as assistant to Perrot <b>had</b> <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> much. Choreography was a logical alternative to dancing for the now 41-year-old Petipa, who was soon to retire from the stage. But {{it was not yet}} to be. In 1860 the renowned French Ballet Master Arthur Saint-Léon was given the coveted position by the director of the Imperial Theatres Andrei Saburov, and soon a healthy and productive rivalry between him and Petipa ensued, bringing the Imperial Ballet to new heights throughout the 1860s.|$|E
25|$|Following this incident, Dost Mohammad Khan {{decided to}} flee to Delhi, the Mughal capital. His horse {{collapsed}} and died after six hours of galloping. Khan continued his journey on foot and reached Karnal. While waiting {{in front of a}} bakery to steal some food, he was recognized by the old clergyman Mullah Jamali of Kashgar, who <b>had</b> <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> Koran in Tirah. Mullah Jamali had left Pushtunistan, and had founded a madrasa (Muslim school) in Delhi. Khan spent around a year in Delhi under Mullah Jamali's shelter, after which he decided to join the Mughal army. The Mullah helped him financially by giving him a horse and five asharfis (gold coins).|$|E

25|$|In 1937 General Bineau, who <b>had</b> <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> at St Cyr, {{wrote on}} his report on his lectureship at CHEM {{that he was}} highly able and {{suitable}} for high command in the future, but that he hid his attributes under “a cold and lofty attitude”. He was put {{in command of the}} 507th Tank Regiment (consisting of a battalion of medium Char D2s and a battalion of R35 light tanks) at Metz on 13 July 1937, and his promotion to full colonel took effect on 24 December that year. De Gaulle attracted public attention by leading a parade of 80 tanks into the Place d’Armes at Metz, in his command tank “Austerlitz”.|$|E
25|$|In 1997 Jones had {{his first}} {{professional}} loss, a disqualification against Montell Griffin (26-0, 18 KOs) at the Taj Majal Hotel & Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Griffin was trained by the legendary Eddie Futch, who <b>had</b> <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> how {{to take advantage of}} Jones technical mistakes and lack of basic boxing fundamentals. Griffin jumped out to an early lead on Jones but by round 9 Jones was ahead on the scorecards by a point and had Griffin on the canvas early in round nine. But as Griffin took a knee on the canvas to avoid further punishment, Jones hit him twice. Subsequently, Jones was disqualified and lost his title. At the time of disqualification, Jones was ahead on two of the judges scorecards (75-76, 77-75, 76-75).|$|E
25|$|UE also {{stood out}} in that period for its {{advocacy}} of equality for African American workers. In July 1950 UE leaders appointed Ernest Thompson, a black international representative and former rank-and-file factory worker, {{as secretary of the}} UE Fair Practices Committee. In essence the union's affirmative action officer, Thompson met with the leadership of UE locals around the country to develop and implement action plans to force employers to hire more black workers, and to give African Americans opportunities to advance into skilled trades jobs. In the midst of the Cold War assaults on UE, the union's newspaper reported such success stories as the promotion of a black worker at Johnson Machine to lathe operator. The company had insisted that this worker was unqualified and refused to train him, so white union members <b>had</b> <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> the job during their lunch breaks.|$|E

25|$|The Waikato {{invasion}} {{began in}} July 1863. However, {{after a very}} short advance, Cameron, whose Crimean experience <b>had</b> <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> {{the importance of a}} sound supply line, realised his supply lines were severely threatened by the enemy. He spent three months securing his rear from attacks. He sent recruiting officers Dillon Bell (former Colonial Treasurer and current Minister of Native Affairs) and John Gorst (former Waikato magistrate) to Australia to raise volunteer forces, which were largely formed into company-based units from the individual states. In all, 2400 Australians volunteered to fight in a variety of units against the Māori forces. In addition, the Australian states willingly sold the New Zealand government vast quantities of rifles, ammunition, uniforms, horses and bullocks, as well as nearly all their latest Armstrong guns and shells to equip the 7000 New Zealand militiamen.|$|E
25|$|Claudius, showed himself {{grateful}} to Agrippa for important services rendered him, and upon his accession, placed under his rule {{the remainder of}} Palestine, the territories of Samaria, Judea, and Idumæa, formerly governed by Archelaus. Loaded with honors and titles, Agrippa returned home, and the few remaining years of his benevolent sway afforded the people {{a brief period of}} peace and prosperity. The evil consequences of a ruler's unbridled passions and tyranny had been sufficiently evident to him in Rome, and they <b>had</b> <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> moderation and strict self-control. His people regarded him with love and devotion, because he healed with tender hand the deep wounds inflicted upon the national susceptibilities by brutal Roman governors. He ruled his subjects with compassion and friendliness. Like the ancestral Asmoneans from whom he sprang through his noble grandmother Mariamne, he honored the Law. Like the merest commoner, he carried his basket of first-fruits to the Temple; with the people he celebrated appropriately the Feast of Tabernacles, and he devoted to the sanctuary a golden chain with which Caligula had honored him. On one occasion, while in the street, he met a bridal procession which drew up to let him pass, but he halted and bade it take precedence. He sought to lighten taxation, remitting the impost on houses in Jerusalem. On the coins minted by him he carefully avoided placing any symbols which could offend the people's religious sentiment. Thus, prosperity and comfort seemed to be dawning anew for the Jews.|$|E
25|$|Light relinquishes {{ownership}} of the Death Note to Kiyomi Takada. After Takada is caught, Light kills her to recover the Death Note, but it is taken by the investigation team. L states that he will test the 13-Day Rule, a fake Death Note rule designed to prove Light and Misa's innocence. Rem, knowing that L's actions will reveal Misa's identity as the 2nd Kira, writes both L's and Watari's names in the Death Note. Light then proceeds to write his father's name in the book, manipulating his father to return the confiscated Death Note. Light confronts his father, but Soichiro does not die. The investigation team members, including L, reveal themselves. Having already written his own name in the Death Note, thus negating Rem's actions, L tells Light {{that he had just}} written in a fake note. Light tries to write on a hidden piece of Death Note, but is shot by Matsuda, an investigation team member. Light tells Ryuk to write the team's names, promising to show him many interesting things, and begins to laugh. He stops, however, when Ryuk shows him that he had written just one name: Light's. Light tries to stop Ryuk, but merely passes right through him. As Light begins to succumb to the effects of the Death Note, Ryuk takes this opportunity to reveal to him that humans that have used the Death Note are barred from entering either Heaven or Hell, instead spending eternity in nothingness. Light dies in his father's arms, begging him to believe that he acted as Kira to put the justice, which Soichiro <b>had</b> <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> since his childhood, into practice. The film concludes one year later, on Light's birthday. Sayu fetches Soichiro and says that Kira helped reduce crime rates, however, she says that she does not support Kira as Light was killed by Kira (which is what Soichiro told her).|$|E
