40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} link-level resource provision in multi-radio multi-channel (MR-MC) wireless networks. To quantify robustness of resource provision schemes, we propose the novel concept of <b>interference</b> <b>margin.</b> Using the notion of <b>interference</b> <b>margin,</b> a robust radio and channel assignment problem is formulated that explicitly takes into consideration link-level traffic demands. The key advantage of the proposed formulation is its robustness to channel variabil-ity and co-existence of external interference sources. We utilize the generalized Benders decomposition techniques to decouple the radio and channel assignment (combinatorial constraints) and network resource allocation(continuous constraints) so that the problem can be solved efficiently. The proposed algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution within {{a finite number of}} iterations. We have evaluated our scheme using traces collected from a wireless mesh testbed and simulation studies in Qualnet.

In this paper, an underlay SR model is proposed, in which an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) system refarms the spectrum of a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system through intelligently exploiting the <b>interference</b> <b>margin</b> provided by the CDMA system. We investigate the mutual effect of the two systems by evaluating the asymptotic signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the users, based on which the <b>interference</b> <b>margin</b> tolerable by the CDMA system is determined. By using the <b>interference</b> <b>margin</b> together with the transmit power constraints, the uplink resource allocation problem of OFDMA system is formulated and solved through dual decomposition method. Simulation results have verified our theoretical analysis, and validated the effectiveness of the proposed resource allocation algorithm and its capability to protect the legacy CDMA users. The proposed SR system requires the least information flow from the CDMA system to the OFDMA system, and importantly, no upgrading of legacy CDMA system is needed; thus it can be deployed by telecom operators to maximize the spectral efficiency of their cellular networks.

40|$|A {{new problem}} {{formulation}} is presented for the Gaussian interference channels (GIFC) with {{two pairs of}} users, which are distinguished as primary users and secondary users, respectively. The primary users employ a pair of encoder and decoder that were originally designed to satisfy a given error performance requirement {{under the assumption that}} no interference exists from other users. In the scenario when the secondary users attempt to access the same medium, we are interested in the maximum transmission rate (defined as accessible capacity) at which secondary users can communicate reliably without affecting the error performance requirement by the primary users under the constraint that the primary encoder (not the decoder) is kept unchanged. By modeling the primary encoder as a generalized trellis code (GTC), we are then able to treat the secondary link and the cross link from the secondary transmitter to the primary receiver as finite state channels (FSCs). Based on this, upper and lower bounds on the accessible capacity are derived. The impact of the error performance requirement by the primary users on the accessible capacity is analyzed by using the concept of <b>interference</b> <b>margin.</b> In the case of non-trivial <b>interference</b> <b>margin,</b> the secondary message is split into common and private parts and then encoded by superposition coding, which delivers a lower bound on the accessible capacity. For some special cases, these bounds can be computed numerically by using the BCJR algorithm. Numerical results are also provided to gain insight into the impacts of the GTC and the error performance requirement on the accessible capacity.

40|$|Multi-antenna {{precoding}} effectively mitigates {{the interference}} in wireless networks. However, the precoding efficiency can be significantly degraded by the overhead {{due to the}} required feedback of channel state information (CSI). This paper addresses such an issue by proposing a systematic method of designing precoders for the two-user multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) interference channels based on finite-rate CSI feedback from receivers to their interferers, called cooperative feedback. Specifically, each precoder is decomposed into inner and outer precoders for nulling interference and improving the data link array gain, respectively. The inner precoders are further designed to suppress residual interference resulting from finite-rate cooperative feedback. To regulate residual interference due to precoder quantization, additional scalar cooperative feedback signals are designed to control transmitters' power using different criteria including applying <b>interference</b> <b>margins,</b> maximizing sum throughput, and minimizing outage probability. Simulation shows that such additional feedback effectively alleviates performance degradation due to quantized precoder feedback. © 2011 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The latter indeed imposes an aggregate <b>interference</b> safety <b>margin</b> for the former to respect, following a chosen minimum probability.

Note that there is a tight relationship between the capacity and coverage planning processes in this case. Furthermore, the design of 2 G systems is mainly oriented to the voice service [2], but 3 G systems are designed to handle traffic from different sources, with different bit rates and, obviously, different requirements in terms of Grade and Quality of Service [3].

In direct-sequence code-division multipleaccess (DS-CDMA) cellular systems, this is limited by the interference present in the link.

Due to the varying link capacity, static channel assignment (SCA) based on fixed link {{capacity is}} not fully using the link capacity. This paper proposes a more efficient channel assignment based on the interference received at the base station (BS). In the proposed algorithm, a channel is assigned if the corresponding <b>interference</b> <b>margin</b> is less than the allowed interference, and, thus, channels are assigned adaptively to dynamically varying link capacity.

40|$|ABSTRACT – As Digital Television Broadcasting spreads {{over the}} world, {{existing}} (and more) TV channels can be distributed in less spectrum in the spectrum traditionally allocated to TV broadcasting. This freed spectrum is {{also referred to}} as the "Digital Dividend " and its use has been debated around the world. In addition, there is also a debate about the potential use of the “white space ” within the TV-bands. This is due to the sparse frequency planning with large <b>interference</b> <b>margins,</b> which is typical in wide area broadcasting. Various technical approaches using Opportunistic Spectrum Access (OSA) have been proposed for unlicensed “white space ” access to the TV bands. Most of previous studies have focused on spectrum sensing, i. e. detecting “free channels”, where secondary users, utilizing White Space Devices (WSD) could avoid causing harmful interference to the TV receivers. However, interference caused by WSD is not only limited to co-channel interference. In particular, in short-range scenarios, the adjacent channel interference is an equally severe problem. Assessing the feasibility of WSDs in short-range indoor scenarios, taking more interference mechanisms into account is the objective of this paper. An Indoor home scenario with Cable, Rooftop antenna and Set-top antenna reception of DVB-T, has been analyzed. The spectrum reuse opportunities for WSDs have been determined, using the number of channels where it is possible to transmit without causing harmful interference to DVB-T receivers as performance measure. Simulation results show that the number of available channels for indoor unlicensed white space transmission appears to be significant in most of the studied scenarios...|$|R

30|$|Inspired by {{the concept}} of {{reservation}} busy tones which are used in [28 – 30] to effectively mitigate interference, we define the Coordination mechanism (CM) to control the CCI in the uncoordinated scenarios under study. Following our approach, the tagged femtocell user (FU) triggers the coordination of surrounding FBS by issuing an in-band requesting signal to advertise its presence. To achieve that, the victim user momentarily suspend its reception and transmit a requesting signal that surrounding interferers detect [5, 29]. Different from the original busy burst solution whereby detecting transmitters estimate their interference parcel from the received feedback; herein, surrounding femtocells only use the busy tone {{as an indication of}} the nearby victim receiver presence. To reduce the likelihood that multiple simultaneous requests trigger the coordination procedure, an <b>interference</b> <b>margin</b> can be introduced {{in order to reduce the}} sensitivity of potential interferers to the triggering criterion. The beacon power is maintained low so as to ideally restrict the group of detecting femtocells to the dominant set of interferers.

Specifically, each precoder/equalizer is decomposed into inner and outer components for nulling the cross-link interference and achieving array gain, respectively. The inner precoders/equalizers are further optimized to suppress the residual interference resulting from finite-rate cooperative feedback. Further- more, the residual interference is regulated by additional scalar cooperative feedback signals that are designed to control transmission power using different criteria including fixed <b>interference</b> <b>margin</b> and maximum sum throughput.
