Sufficient optimality conditions and various Mond–Weir duality results are proved for nondifferentiable multiobjective programming problems involving functions of such type.

The chalkboard and self-made drawings and charts were the materials often used. Conventional methods like lecture, open class discussion and demonstration were commonly employed. The strategies included group discussion, use of motivating questions and stories to arouse the interest of students.

40|$|New soft-computing {{architectures}} {{and approaches}} are de- manded {{for the control}} and operating systems of service robots [1]. In this paper, a fuzzy logic controlled autonomous vehicle - MORIA -, is presented. For achieving sophisticated guiding and controlling properties, local actions and global strategies are combined within the fuzzy controller. Local perceptions and global commands influence the recurrent fuzzy state variables, which on their turn activate different fuzzy rule sets. Thus, the fuzzy controller has a context dependent behaviour. Key words: mobile robots; recurrent fuzzy systems; goal-oriented navigation; collision avoidance; real-time control; autonomous vehicles <b>I</b> <b>Objectives</b> of the Research Project The main goal of our current research project {{is the development of}} a collision-free autonomous vehicle for unknown indoor environments. One of the main feature of such a service robot is its ability to locate itself on an existing map [2]. Therefore it has to create a map of its local surroundings based on the information recorded by its sensors. This local map is then steadily compared to the global map previously stored in memory. Furthermore, a global path planning system generates local instructions for the navigation system, in order to reach predefined goals. Based on this approach, the planner and the navigator are robust against uncertainties und unpredictable situations, which come up during the exploration or goal-oriented navigation of the system...|$|E

The Phase <b>I</b> <b>objectives,</b> schedule, and test results are presented in this paper. These data shows the power, energy, and mirror performance are comparable to that when the hardware was first manufactured 15 years ago. During the Phase I and initial Phase II test period the on-sun system accumulated over 3, 800 hours of solar-powered operating time, accumulated over 4, 500 hours of concentrator solar tracking time, and generated over 50, 000 kWh of grid-compatible electrical energy.

40|$|All Phase <b>I</b> <b>objectives</b> were met. In the Phase I program, TPL {{developed}} a material, T- 450, capable of removing elemental mercury from air. It {{was found to}} have high porosity, good mechanical strength, good affinity for aqueous ionic mercury, and good stability to hot acidic gas. The material, used as a granular solid, was tested for adsorption of mercury in two protocols, one involving static room-temperature air and one using flowing hot air. In each case, it was superior to activated carbon. The following results were obtained: 1. Sol-gel methods were found to be applicable for synthesis of silicates containing oxidized thiol (disulfide) groups. 2. Synthetic parameters were determined for silicates with a variety of physical properties and performances. 3. Measurement of physical properties indicate high porosity strength, and stability to conditions found in flue gases. 4. The Hg° adsorption of T- 450 was superior to that of activated carbon; static testing indicated a 2. 4 -fold increase in mercury adsorption, while a flow system mimicking hot flue gas indicated a 3. 6 -fold increase in Hg adsorption. 5. Economic analysis indicated that T- 450 is a strong candidate for scale-up and commercial development.

40|$|The {{extent to}} which use of fire by Aboriginal peoples shaped the landscapes and biota of Australia is a {{contentious}} issue. Equally contentious is the proposition that attempts {{should be made to}} support and re-establish customary practice. Some dismiss Aboriginal practice as little more than culturally endorsed pyromania, and consequences for land, vegetation and wildlife management as incidental and unintended outcomes. We argue that this view of Aboriginal practice is at odds with available evidence regarding motivations for use of fire, and detailed and sophisticated descriptions of the consequences of poor fire management for the maintenance of important resources. We suggest that misunderstanding arises, at least in part, from the contrasting views that (<b>i)</b> <b>objectives</b> of Aboriginal land managers and the values they seek to extract and maintain in savanna landscapes are or should be similar to those of non-Indigenous land managers; or (ii) the notion that their goals are inherently and entirely incompatible with those of non-indigenous interests. We illustrate our argument with examples that include assessments of ecological consequences of 2 ̆ 7 prescribed 2 ̆ 7 Aboriginal practice, statements from Aboriginal people regarding their objectives in applying those prescriptions, and the level of active organisation required for their effective implementation. Finally, we propose mechanisms for wider application of Aboriginal prescriptions in tropical landscapes to meet a range of land management objectives...|$|E
