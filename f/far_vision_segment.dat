40|$|Presbyopia is an age-related {{disorder}} {{where the}} lens of the eye hardens so that focusing on near objects becomes increasingly difficult. This complaint affects everyone over the age of 50. It is becoming progressively more relevant, as {{the average age of the}} global population continues to rise. Bifocal or varifocal spectacles are currently the best solution for those that require near and <b>far</b> <b>vision</b> correction. However, many people prefer not to wear spectacles and while multifocal contact lenses are available, they are not widely prescribed and can require significant adaptation by wearers. One possible solution is to use liquid crystal contact lenses that can change focal power by applying a small electric field across the device. However, the design of these contact lenses must be carefully considered as they must be comfortable for the user to wear and able to provide the required change in focal power (usually about + 2 D). Progress towards different lens designs, which includes lens geometry, liquid crystal choices and suitable alignment modes, are reviewed. Furthermore, we also discuss suitable electrode materials, possible power sources and suggest some methods for switching the lenses between near and <b>far</b> <b>vision</b> correction...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: To {{assess the}} {{functional}} and anatomic outcomes of cataract and idiopathic epiretinal macular membrane extraction in combined and consecutive surgeries. DESIGN: Multicenter, retrospective, comparative case series. METHODS: One hundred seventy-four patients (174 eyes) with an epiretinal macular membrane (ERM) and cataract were operated on in 1 or 2 sessions in 2 academic centers, Dijon University Hospital and Nancy University Hospital. Combined surgery (n = 109) and consecutive surgery (n = 65) were performed between 2005 and 2006. All patients underwent ERM and internal limiting membrane removal. Cataract {{extraction was performed}} with phacoemulsification followed by a posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation. The main outcome measures were near and far visual acuity and central macular thickness evaluated with optical coherence tomography. RESULTS: After a 12 -month follow-up, the postoperative best-corrected visual acuities significantly improved in both the combined and the consecutive surgery groups (near and <b>far</b> <b>vision</b> in both groups, P <. 0001). Similarly, the postoperative macular thickness significantly decreased in both groups (P <. 0001). We noted no statistical differences between the visual acuity improvement in both groups (near <b>vision,</b> P=. 54; <b>far</b> <b>vision,</b> P =. 38). However, visual acuity recovery was quicker in the combined surgery group. CONCLUSIONS: Combined and consecutive surgeries are effective procedures to treat idiopathic ERM.

40|$|Simultaneous {{vision is}} an {{increasingly}} used {{solution for the}} correction of presbyopia (the age-related loss of ability to focus near images). Simultaneous Vision corrections, normally delivered {{in the form of}} contact or intraocular lenses, project on the patient’s retina a focused image for near vision superimposed with a degraded image for <b>far</b> <b>vision,</b> or a focused image for <b>far</b> <b>vision</b> superimposed with the defocused image of the near scene. It is expected that patients with these corrections are able to adapt to the complex Simultaneous Vision retinal images, although the mechanisms or the extent to which this happens is not known. We studied the neural adaptation to simultaneous vision by studying changes in the Natural Perceived Focus and in the Perceptual Score of image quality in subjects after exposure to Simultaneous Vision. We show that Natural Perceived Focus shifts after a brief period of adaptation to a Simultaneous Vision blur, similar to adaptation to Pure Defocus. This shift strongly correlates with the magnitude and proportion of defocus in the adapting image. The magnitude of defocus affects perceived quality of Simultaneous Vision images, with 0. 5 D defocus scored lowest and beyond 1. 5 D scored ‘‘sharp’’. Adaptation to Simultaneous Vision shifts the Perceptual Score of these images towards higher rankings. Larger improvements occurred when testing simultaneous images with the same magnitude of defocus as the adapting images, indicating that wearing a particular bifocal correction improves the perception of images provided by that correction...|$|R

Methods: Subjects 6 to 12 {{years of age}} and with myopia of - 0. 75 to - 4. 00 diopters and astigmatism {{less than or equal to}} 1. 00 diopters were prospectively assigned OK contact lens or SV spectacle correction.

Results: Thirty-one children were fitted with OK contact lenses and 30 with SV spectacles. Children wearing OK contact lenses rated overall <b>vision,</b> <b>far</b> distance <b>vision,</b> symptoms, appearance, satisfaction, activities, academic performance, handling, peer perceptions, and the overall score significantly better than children wearing SV spectacles (all P 0. 05).

50|$|Accommodation is {{the process}} by which the {{vertebrate}} eye adjusts focus on an object as it moves closer or further away. Whereas birds and mammals achieve accommodation by deforming the lens of their eyes, fish and amphibians normally adjust focus by moving the lens closer or further from the retina.

In bony fishes the muscle is called the retractor lentis, and is relaxed for near vision, whereas for cartilaginous fishes the muscle is called the protractor lentis, and is relaxed for <b>far</b> <b>vision.</b> Thus bony fishes accommodate for distance vision by moving the lens further from the retina, while cartilaginous fishes accommodate for near vision by moving the lens closer to the retina.|$|R
