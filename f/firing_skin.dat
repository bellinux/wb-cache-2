Airing in two parts in 2013, the episode was {{the third and final}} {{episode of the}} specially-commissioned seventh season intended to bring the series to a close, and the final episode of the series. While in its initial six-year run Skins was a teen drama about the lives of Bristolian teenagers, Skins Rise like the two previous episodes, <b>Skins</b> <b>Fire</b> and <b>Skins</b> Pure, is a filmically and tonally distinct drama which revisits one of the show's characters as they face adulthood.|$|R

60|$|The young man's first {{feeling was}} one of admiration for the woman before him, who, {{in spite of her}} {{grotesque}} attire and defiant, unwomanly air, was strikingly beautiful. She was tall, and not even the man's ragged overcoat which she wore could conceal the grace of her figure. Her abundant black hair was twisted into a sagging knot at her neck, and from beneath the old fur cap looked out a pair of large and brilliant black eyes, heavily lashed, and full of a smouldering <b>fire.</b> Her <b>skin</b> was tanned and coarsened, but the warm crimson blood glowed in her cheeks with a dusky richness, and her face was a perfect oval, with features chiselled in almost classic regularity of outline.|$|R
60|$|By nightfall the Rough Riders {{reached the}} little village of Siboney without having met the enemy.

Surely being a soldier was not all glory after all.|$|R
60|$|While {{speaking}} {{she turned}} towards her home, pointing with raised hand.

The episode included an elaborate special effects sequence wherein actor Jay Underwood rips off his face to reveal <b>fire</b> underneath his <b>skin,</b> which was created via green screen technology.|$|R
60|$|It was a small, narrow kitchen. He {{dropped his}} {{cap on the}} table that was covered with {{yellowish}} American cloth, and took a seat {{with his back to}} the wall, near the oven.

Everything in the house was very clean and bright. The man sat silent, too, his head dropped. And thus they remained.|$|R
40|$|Fire fighters rely on fire fighter {{protective}} clothing (FFPC) {{to provide adequate}} protection in the various hazardous environments they may encounter during operations. FFPC has seen significant advancement in technology {{over the past few}} decades. The addition of phase change material (PCM) to FFPC is a new technology with potential to enhance the thermal protection provided by the FFPC. To explore this technology, data from bench-scale experiments involving FFPC with PCMs are compared with a theoretical finite difference heat transfer model. The results demonstrate an effective method to mathematically model the heat transfer and provide insight into the effectiveness of improving the thermal protection of FFPC. The experiments confirm that the latent heat absorbed during the phase change reduces temperatures that might be experienced at the <b>fire</b> fighter's <b>skin</b> surface, advancing the high temperature performance of FFPC...|$|R

The courthouse, built in 1933, serves the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas and was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. His work also includes the oil on canvas mural titled Long Horns in the Ogallala, Nebraska post office, commissioned by the Treasury Section of Fine Arts, and completed in 1938. Mechau painted another mural in 1940 titled Ranchers of the Panhandle Fighting Prairie <b>Fire</b> with <b>Skinned</b> Steer commissioned for the post office in Brownfield, Texas.

500|$|Conditions were severe for horses at the front; {{they were}} killed by {{artillery}} <b>fire,</b> suffered from <b>skin</b> disorders, and were injured by poison gas. Hundreds of thousands of horses died, and many more were treated at veterinary hospitals and {{sent back to the}} front. Procuring fodder was a major issue, and Germany lost many horses to starvation. [...] Several memorials have been erected to commemorate the horses that died. Artists, including Alfred Munnings, extensively documented the work of horses in the war, and horses were featured in war poetry.

This resulted in a weight-optimized, blast-resistant EFAB design which was fabricated and attached to an aircraft. The chain gun was <b>fired</b> near these <b>skins</b> during hover and forward flight without structural damage. Strain data collected during gun fire verified the analytical method...|$|R

A large shadow of her shape rose upon the wall and ceiling. She bent forward, at which each diamond on her neck gave a sinister wink like a toad's; and pressing her forehead against his temple she entered on her story of her acquaintance with Alec d'Urberville and its results, murmuring the words without flinching, and with her eyelids drooping down.|$|R
50|$|Brother Voodoo {{possesses}} numerous mystical and quasi-physical powers {{derived from}} the Loa, the spirit-gods of voodoo.

Brother Voodoo can mystically create smoke accompanied {{by the sound of}} drums. The smoke conceals his presence while he is able to see through it. He has the ability to command certain living things by a mystic sort of hypnotism, most effective over animals and plants. He can summon the Loa to request transport for himself and others instantaneously if they deem it necessary to his mission.|$|R

Rae develops a close friendship with Chloe, being the first she confides in, becoming her roommate after Liz leaves, and is suggested by her to escape with them. She is captured along with Chloe after going to her Aunt Lauren for help. She is described as having copper skin and long,dark curls.|$|R
5000|$|Fire cupping {{involves}} soaking {{a cotton}} ball in almost pure alcohol. The cotton is clamped {{by a pair}} of forceps and lit via match or lighter, and, in one motion, placed into the cup and quickly removed, while the cup is placed on the <b>skin.</b> <b>Fire</b> heats the inside of the cup and a small amount of suction is created by the air cooling down again and contracting. Massage oil may be applied to create a better seal as well as allow the cups to glide over muscle groups (e.g. trapezius, erectors, latisimus dorsi, etc.) in an act called [...] "moving cupping". Dark circles may appear where the cups were placed because of rupture of the capillaries just under the skin. There are documented cases of burns caused by fire cupping.|$|R
5000|$|Part one {{received}} a generally positive response, with reviewers expressing slight apprehension {{in light of}} the ending for <b>Skins</b> <b>Fire.</b> Den of Geek writer Caroline Preece said that Pure fit in with the style of Cassie's original episodes, as these were [...] "the most aesthetically beautiful" [...] of the series, and in relation to the previous episode commented: [...] "This {{is a different kind of}} young adulthood than the one encountered by girls like Effy Stonem, and that doesn't make it any less real or worth exploring." [...] Preece also stated that a [...] "world-weary Cassie is hard to take at first, but it’s strikingly different from what the show has done before."

His long garment was gathered tightly round his spare form, his feet drawn {{up and his}} head bent far forward, while the wind of his speed divided his beard, which flew out in two long streamers behind.
