50|$|The federal {{government}} had controlled the price of natural gas that crossed state lines, but not of gas produced and sold within a state. In the 1970s, the low interstate price set by the {{federal government}} caused supply shortages of gas in consuming states, because gas producers sold {{as much as they could}} of their product for higher prices in the local markets within gas-producing states. In the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, the federal government <b>extended</b> <b>price</b> controls to all natural gas in the country. At the same time, the government created a complex price system in which the price paid to the producer depended on the date the well was drilled, the depth of the well, the geological formation, the distance to other gas wells, and several other factors. The price system was an attempt to keep the average price low while encouraging new production.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{consider}} price-fee {{competition in}} bilateral oligopolies with perfectly-divisible goods, non-expandable infrastructures, concentrated agents on both sides, and constant marginal costs. We define and characterize stable market outcomes. Buyers exclusively {{trade with the}} supplier with whom they achieve maximal bilateral joint welfare. Prices equal marginal costs. Threats to switch suppliers set maximal fees. These also arise from a negotiation model that <b>extends</b> <b>price</b> competition. Competition in both prices and fees necessarily emerges. It improves welfare compared to price competition, but consumer surpluses do not increase. The minimal infrastructure achieving maximal aggregate welfare differs {{from the one that}} protects buyers most. ...|$|R

The present thesis develops multi-weighted MSO-logics on finite, infinite and timed words which are expressively equivalent to multi-weighted automata, and studies decision problems for them. In addition, a Nivat-like theorem for weighted timed automata is proved; this theorem establishes a connection between quantitative and qualitative behaviors of timed automata.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} regulatory incentive {{mechanisms for}} efficient {{investment in the}} transmission network, taking into account both technological externalities among transmission lines and information asymmetry between the regulator and the transmission company (Transco). First, by adding extra constraints associated with the power flow, we develop an <b>extended</b> <b>price</b> cap mechanism that can internalize technological externalities among transmission lines. We show that this new mechanism induces the Transco to choose the optimal transmission capacity under its budget constraint. An extended form of the Vogelsang and Finsinger (V-F) mechanism is also introduced. Next, we examine the surplus-based scheme with government transfers. We provide a formal analysis of the incremental surplus subsidy (ISS) scheme specifically for the Transco, demonstrating that it induces the Transco to choose the optimal transmission capacity without the budget constraint. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus in}} this paper is on the {{input-output}} price model as initially developed by Leontief nearly 60 years ago. A number of methodological refinements are proposed, including the formulation, for the first time, of an <b>extended</b> <b>price</b> model, with a disaggregated household sector. This model is presented in both static and dynamic versions. The effects of these refinements are investigated empirically by reference to an example of policy analysis. This relates to a hypothetical proposal to remove energy subsidies {{at the national level}} in Iran. The paper reports on the different results produced by each form of price model and also provides evidence on the sensitivity of individual parameter values. The paper concludes by considering the feasibility of constructing more comprehensive versions of the price model and identifying those elements of the model for which data {{are likely to be more}} difficult to obtain at national and regional levels.

As concerns the overall price trend—whose general outlines are already well known—one finds that the steady rise {{in the sixteenth century}} was approxi-mately twice as great as that in the eighteenth. Cyclical variations slowly dropped from about 30 % in the fifteenth century to 20 % in the eighteenth. It is of interest that particularily serious cyclical crises affected almost all of the cities under consideration: a total of 10 in the sixteenth century, but only 7 in the seventeenth and 3 in the eighteenth. We found that there was a slight tendency toward unification of price movement in French towns starting in 1670, though absolute differences remained very marked.

40|$|Affine jump-diffusion (AJD) {{processes}} {{constitute a}} large and widely used class of continuous-time asset pricing models that balance tractability and flexibility in matching market data. The prices of e. g., bonds, options, and other assets in AJD models are given by <b>extended</b> <b>pricing</b> transforms that have an exponential-affine form; these transforms have been characterized in great generality by Duffie et al. [2000. Transform analysis and asset pricing for affine jump-diffusions. Econometrica 68, 1343 - 1376]. Calculating model prices requires inversion of these transforms, and this has limited the application of AJD models to the comparatively small subclass for which the transforms are available in closed form. This article seeks to widen the scope of AJD models amenable to practical application through approximate transform inversion techniques. More specifically, we develop the use of saddlepoint approximations for AJD models. These approximations facilitate the calculation of prices in AJD models whose transforms are not available explicitly. We derive and test several alternative saddlepoint approximations and find that they produce accurate prices {{over a wide range}} of parameters.
