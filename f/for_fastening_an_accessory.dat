50|$|The amphora {{complements}} the large storage container, the pithos, which makes available capacities between one-half and two and one-half tons. In contrast, the amphora holds under a half-ton, typically less than 50 kilograms (100 lbs). The {{bodies of the}} two types have similar shapes. Where the pithos may have multiple small loops or lugs <b>for</b> <b>fastening</b> <b>a</b> rope harness, the amphora has two expansive handles joining {{the shoulder of the}} body and a long neck. The necks of pithoi are wide for scooping or bucket access. The necks of amphorae are narrow for pouring by a person holding it by the bottom and a handle. Some variants exist. The handles might not be present. The size may require two or three handlers to lift. For the most part, however, an amphora was tableware, or sat close to the table, was intended to be seen, and was finely decorated as such by master painters.|$|R

40|$|A {{push type}} {{fastener}} <b>for</b> <b>fastening</b> <b>a</b> movable structural part (41) to a fixed structural part (43), wherein the coupling and decoupling actions are both a push type operation, the fastener {{consisting of a}} plunger (12) having a shank (20) with a plunger head (18) {{at one end and}} a threaded end portion (26 a) at the other end, an expandable grommet (14) adapted to receive the plunger shank (20) therethrough, and an attachable head (16) which is securable to the threaded end of the plunger shank (20). The fastener (10) requires each structural part (41, 43) to be provided with an aperture (45, 46) and the attachable head (16) to be smaller than the aperture (46) in the second structural part. The plunger (12) is extensible through the grommet (14) and is structurally configured with an external camming surface (25) which is cooperatively engageable with internal surfaces (38) of the grommet so that when the plunger is inserted in the grommet, the relative positioning of said cooperable camming surfaces determines the expansion of the grommet. Coupling of the parts is effected when the grommet is inserted in the aperture (46) in the fixed structural part (43) and expanded by pushing the plunger head (18) and plunger at least a minimal distance through the grommet. Decoupling is effected by pushing the attachable head (16) ...|$|R

25|$|Optical fibers are {{connected}} to terminal equipment by optical fiber connectors. These connectors are usually of a standard type such as FC, SC, ST, LC, MTRJ, MPO or SMA. Optical fibers may be connected to each other by connectors or by splicing, that is, joining two fibers {{together to form a}} continuous optical waveguide. The generally accepted splicing method is arc fusion splicing, which melts the fiber ends together with an electric arc. <b>For</b> quicker <b>fastening</b> jobs, <b>a</b> “mechanical splice” is used.|$|R
25|$|Fang bolts or {{rail anchor}} bolts {{have also been}} used for fixing rails or chairs to sleepers. The fang bolt is a bolt {{inserted}} {{through a hole in}} the sleeper with a fanged nut that bites into the lower surface of the sleeper. <b>For</b> <b>fastening</b> flat-bottomed rails, <b>an</b> upper-lipped washer can be used to grip the edge of the rail. They are more resistant to loosening by vibrations and movement of the rail. They are thought more effective than spikes and screws and so are used in positions such as switch (point) tieplates and on sharp curves.|$|R
50|$|The bowline is {{commonly}} used in sailing small craft, <b>for</b> example to <b>fasten</b> <b>a</b> halyard {{to the head of}} a sail or to tie a jib sheet to a clew of a jib. The bowline is well known as a rescue knot for such purposes as rescuing people who might have fallen down a hole, or off a cliff onto a ledge. They would put it around themselves and sit on the loop. This makes it easy to heft them up away from danger. The Federal Aviation Administration recommends the bowline knot for tying down light aircraft.|$|R
60|$|When {{they sat}} down Jake took {{out a piece of}} thick iron about six inches long, forged into {{something}} like the shape of a U, though the curve was different and one arm was shorter than the other. Much depended on the curve, for the thing was made on the model of an old-fashioned but efficient clamp that carpenters sometimes use <b>for</b> <b>fastening</b> work to <b>a</b> bench. A blow or pressure on one part wedged it fast, but a sharp tap on the other enabled it to be lifted off. This was convenient, because as the work progressed, the track along the dam had to be lengthened and the guard fixed across a fresh pair of rails.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the main}} {{features}} of TABs is their strength, requiring fewer tree penetrations <b>for</b> robust <b>fastening</b> of <b>a</b> treehouse and hence less damage to a live tree. A typical TAB consists of a threaded metal bolt and a larger diameter collar. The latter provides an extra bending strength by bearing upon the compression strength of the tree grain. Since treehouses are subject to frequent load reversal produced by winds, TABs must be made of spring steel The bolts are able to support from between 9,000 and 12,000 lbs kg, a much greater load than conventional lag bolts.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The <b>fastening</b> is <b>an</b> {{important}} part <b>for</b> <b>fastening</b> when laying the rails, which requires sufficient fastening pressure, strength, and durability. This {{article focuses on}} the fatigue fracture of the spring clip of <b>a</b> <b>fastening</b> and gets <b>a</b> result that the fracture accounts for alternating twist-bend load by examining macro-fracture. The crack origin is {{on the surface of}} the clip where significant decarburization and corrosion exists and its extension makes the clip break by examining metallographic structure and testing micro-hardness. The solution is to improve the heat treatment method and the surface quality avoiding corrosion...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a {{different}} issue {{of mechanical engineering}} interests is determined <b>for</b> threaded <b>fastened</b> joints. <b>A</b> series of photoelastic experiments were performed to determine the maximum strains for the holes in a tensile flat plate subjected to bolt-nut loads. Pertinent strain distributions were examined to determine the roll of the torques on the bolts in mini- mizing the strain; hence stress concentration. The experimental determination of maximum strains is needed {{as a way to}} validate future theoretical and numerical results, and provide a valuable aid to their application. The emphasis of this paper is on deformation. The results indicate that strains can decrease significantly with the increase of the bolt’s pre-load...|$|R
60|$|Of some {{of these}} my wife and I did not approve. For instance, a tin pan {{containing}} iron spoons, the dinner bell, and a miscellaneous collection of hardware balanced on the top stair of the staircase, and so connected with fine cords that a thief coming up the stairs would send it rattling and bounding to the bottom, was looked upon by us with great disfavour. The descent of the pan, whether by innocent accident or the approach of a burglar, might throw our little boy into a fit, {{to say nothing of}} the terrible fright it would give my Aunt Martha, who was a maiden lady of middle age, and not accustomed to a clatter in the night. A bull-dog in the house my wife would not have, nor, indeed, a dog of any kind. George William was not yet old enough to play with dogs, especially a sharp one; and if the dog was not sharp it was of no use to have him in the house. To the ordinary burglar-alarm she strongly objected. She had been in houses where these things went off of their own accord, occasioning great consternation; and, besides, she said that if thieves got into the house she did not want to know it and she did not want me to know it; the quicker they found what they came for and went away with it the better. Of course, she wished them kept out, if such a thing were possible; but if they did get in, our duty as parents of the dearest little boy was non-interference. She insisted, however, that the room in which the loveliest of children slept, and which was also occupied by ourselves, should be made absolutely burglar proof; and this object, by means of extraordinary bolts and chains, I flattered myself I accomplished. My Aunt Martha had <b>a</b> patent contrivance <b>for</b> <b>fastening</b> <b>a</b> door that she always used, whether at home or travelling, and in whose merit she placed implicit confidence. Therefore we did not feel it necessary to be anxious about her; and the servants slept at the top of the house, where thieves would not be likely to go.|$|R
