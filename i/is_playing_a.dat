5|$|A couple, {{referred}} to {{only as the}} Master and Mistress, purchase a pure-bred rough collie named Lad to be the guard dog of their home, the Place. Though they are surprised when they receive a puppy instead of an adult dog, they decide to keep him and he quickly shows himself to be very intelligent and easily trainable. At first, Lad views all people as friends, including a burglar who robs the house one night. When the man climbs out the window {{with a bag of}} loot, Lad thinks he <b>is</b> <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> game and snatches the bag in play. The thief chases Lad, then shoots him to get back the bag. Lad realizes the man is not friendly and turns to attack him, but the thief falls into a ditch, knocking himself unconscious. Afterward, Lad no longer trusts strangers so easily and has become a true watchdog.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between river flows and Murray cod recruitment {{are more complex}} than first thought, and in less regulated rivers, Murray cod {{may be able to}} recruit under a range of conditions including stable low flows. (Significant recruitment of Murray cod in low-flow conditions in less regulated lowland rivers has now been proven.) This information also suggests that nonriver-regulation-related causes of degradation are playing a larger role in the survival and recruitment of Murray cod larvae than first thought; competition from extremely large numbers of invasive carp larvae are negatively affecting the survival and recruitment of Murray cod larvae to a much greater degree than first thought; and that decades of overfishing <b>is</b> <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> far larger role in the current state of Murray cod stocks, through depletion of spawning adults, than first thought.|$|E

25|$|The {{problem of}} finding {{agreement}} on musical issues {{is complicated by}} the fact that each player <b>is</b> <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> different part, that may appear to demand dynamics or gestures contrary to those of other parts in the same passage. Sometimes these differences are even specified in the score – for example, where cross-dynamics are indicated, with one instrument crescendoing while another is getting softer.|$|E

Today, most of the industries are requested to reduce their energy consumption by using renewable energy sources and optimizing their energy usage.|$|E
25|$|Strikes: Strikes or taps {{are similar}} to cuts except that a finger below the sounded note is briefly lowered to the whistle. For example, if a player <b>is</b> <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> low E on a D whistle the player could tap by quickly {{lowering}} and raising his or her bottom finger. Both cuts and taps are essentially instantaneous; the listener should not perceive them as separate notes.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of the series, slavery had been {{abolished}} for some time, but segregation, similar to Jim Crow, continues to operate to keep the crosses (Blacks) in control of the noughts (Whites). An international organisation, the Pangaean Economic Community, exists. Seeming to be similar to the United Nations in scope but similar to the European Union in powers, it <b>is</b> <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> role in forcing change by directives and boycotts.|$|E
25|$|In New England, {{predator}} depletion {{has triggered}} extensive marsh die-off salt marsh creek banks. Herbivory has already impacted up to 90% of creek banks {{in more than}} 70% of outer Cape Cod marshes. Absent in 1997, die-off has recently spread into Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, impacting over 85% of creek banks. The nocturnal purple marsh crab, Sesarma reticulatum, <b>is</b> <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> major role in this die-off through increased burrowing and herbivory due to release from predation pressure. Evidence has pointed to top-down control caused by human disturbances as the primary agent driving die-off.|$|E

Tariel lifts off when the Waves (both northern and southern) are a few kilometers away from the Capital. Shortly before the two reach it, Gorbovsky, Camill, Sklyarov and Turchina sit on the beach not far from the city and watch a team of null-T-testers float their blind team-mate toward the southern Wave, while he <b>is</b> <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> song on the banjo.|$|E

While Alan <b>is</b> <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> game of PAC-MAN the power goes out again. Stu {{suddenly}} realizes where Teddy is. The trio rushes {{back to the hotel}} to find Teddy who is in the elevator unharmed (albeit still missing a finger). Teddy had woken {{up in the middle of}} the night to get more ice for his severed finger (after the first bucket of ice had melted) but became trapped after the power went out. The four use Chow's speedboat, the Perfect Life, the keys for which were in Teddy's pocket, to travel back to the wedding reception.|$|E
25|$|On 1 February 2008, Clare {{returns to}} Albert Square; she is thrown {{from the back}} seat of a car. Nigel's former landlady, Dot Branning, persuades her to stay. Clare moves in with Dot and gets a job as {{receptionist}} at Tanya Branning (Jo Joyner)'s beauty parlour. Preferring rich men, Clare tries to attract the attention of the wealthy men in Albert Square. Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) and his brother Max (Jake Wood) show no interest; however, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) is more susceptible despite being married to Jane (Laurie Brett). Clare flirts with Ian, wears revealing clothes and talks suggestively but she <b>is</b> <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> game and has no intention of taking things further, acting shocked when Ian suggests that she does. She blackmails Ian, threatening to inform Jane of his dishonourable intentions unless he pays to keep quiet but Ian tells Jane himself so she confronts Clare, warning her to stay away from Ian.|$|E
25|$|If {{the ball}} strikes {{any part of}} the batsman's person (not {{necessarily}} the leg), and, in the umpire's judgement, the ball would have hit the batsman's stumps but for this interception, then the batsman is out. The point of impact must be within line with the batsman's stumps and the bowler's stumps if the batsman <b>is</b> <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> stroke. The batsman can be given out if the ball strikes him outside the off stump, if the ball would have hit the stumps and if the batsman is playing no stroke. The ball must not pitch outside the line of leg stump. Also, the ball cannot have made contact with the bat or glove that is touching the bat before hitting the batsman. If the ball hits the batsman either on the full or immediately after bouncing, the umpire is required to assume that the ball is travelling straight on, ignoring any spin, swing or other hard to predict movement that may have changed the direction of the ball if it had not hit the batsman.|$|E

500|$|Schenn is a defensive-defenceman {{who plays}} a {{physical}} game while attempting to prevent opponents from scoring. Since his rookie season, he {{has been among the}} NHL leaders in hits.

[...] Growing up, Schenn patterned his play after fellow defencemen Chris Pronger and Rob Blake.|$|E
500|$|... : A gambler meets a tengu, {{who asks}} {{him what he}} is most frightened of. The gambler lies, {{claiming}} that he is terrified of gold or mochi. The tengu answers truthfully that he is frightened {{of a kind of}} plant or some other mundane item. The tengu, thinking he <b>is</b> <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> cruel trick, then causes money or rice cakes to rain down on the gambler. The gambler is of course delighted and proceeds to scare the tengu away with the thing he fears most. The gambler then obtains the tengu's magic gourd (or another treasured item) that was left behind.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} of the song was {{directed}} by Cameron Duddy and Mars, and was released February 5, 2013.

The video is based on 70's vibe and retro effects. The set and the idea of the video is similar to one used for [...] "Love in the Key of C", a 1997 Belinda Carlisle minor hit.|$|E
500|$|Some reviews lamented Steinman's absence. According to Allmusic, [...] "this Bat {{is quite}} {{obviously}} a patchwork, pieced together from things borrowed and recreated, never quite gelling the way {{either of the}} previous Bats did." [...] They criticized [...] "The Monster Is Loose" [...] as a [...] "disarming, a grindingly metallic riff-rocker that sits very uncomfortably next to Steinman's [...] "It's All Coming Back to Me Now", and Child as [...] "a professional who <b>is</b> <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> game without bothering to learn the rules." [...] On the other hand, the review commended Meat Loaf's voice: he sings [...] "his heart out as he valiantly tries to make this Bat a worthy successor to the originals." ...|$|E
