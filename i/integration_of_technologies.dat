40|$|This study {{built on}} {{previous}} research in 2010 to determine changes to students’ current use of and expectations for future <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>technologies</b> in their learning experience.

While academic practice {{has been slow to}} change, this study reveals a continued need for academic development to focus on strategies that enhance technology adoption amongst academic staff. Students’ preferences from this and the earlier study suggest that they would like more use of technologies, especially mobile technologies for efficient and convenient access to content, communication and assessment that can not only inform academic development and course design for fully online and blended learning courses, but also for the growing number of massive open and online courses (MOOCs) in the education landscape...|$|E

40|$|The {{complexity}} {{inherent to}} technological {{integration in the}} context of basic education in the current reality of the students and the digital culture that permeates society today features a transformation in the dynamics of knowledge construction. It is difficult to connect students, fully involving them in this process when using traditional teaching and learning methods. This new context requires interdisciplinary research for better understanding, involving experts in the field of sciences and more technical areas such as engineering and computer science. To answer {{the question of how to}} handle the evolution of interdisciplinary theoretical and empirical studies related to the subject, it was developed a survey in order to understand the evolution, interdisciplinarity and the theoretical and empirical variables related to the <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>technologies</b> in the Brazilian basic education.

40|$|A {{technology}} {{survey was}} conducted in a small British Columbia urban school district. The objective {{was to determine the}} districts' elementary teachers' support needs, beliefs, and technology adoption stage with regard to the <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> in their classrooms. From the data collected, I have provided an additional source of information that could enhance my district's future technology plans. Specifically, the data provide additional information on how the elementary teachers in the District believe the <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> can be supported in this District. Past research has found numerous interconnected factors that influence the level <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> in today's classrooms. The analysis of the survey responses indicated that in this District elementary teachers most frequently identify their level <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> adoption at level 5 (adaptation to other contexts), recognize {{there is a need for}} a school-based technology support person, and that the teachers need to experiment with technology-enhanced curriculum before they are comfortable with it. The teachers have the technology skills and believe in its usefulness to foster student success however they lack the knowledge to integrate technology throughout the curriculum. The results from the survey suggest that future district technology plans incorporate professional development activities and support structures that recognize their elementary teachers' identified needs, beliefs, and present adoption level in order to encourage the <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> in the elementary curriculum.
