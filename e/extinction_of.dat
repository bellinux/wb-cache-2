5|$|The <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> megalodon set {{the stage}} for further changes in marine communities. The average body size of baleen whales {{increased}} significantly after its disappearance, although possibly due to other, climate-related, causes. Conversely however, the increase in baleen whale size {{may have contributed to the}} <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> megalodon, as they may have preferred to go after smaller whales; bite marks on large whale species may have come from scavenging sharks. Megalodon may have simply become coextinct with smaller whale species, such as Piscobalaena nana. The <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> megalodon had a positive impact on other apex predators of the time, such as the great white shark, in some cases spreading to regions where megalodon became absent.|$|E
5|$|The mass <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> marine {{plankton}} {{appears to}} have been abrupt and right at the K–Pg boundary. Ammonite genera became extinct at or near the K–Pg boundary; however, there was a smaller and slower <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> ammonite genera prior to the boundary that was associated with a late Cretaceous marine regression. The gradual <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> most inoceramid bivalves began well before the K–Pg boundary, and a small, gradual reduction in ammonite diversity occurred throughout the very late Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with most}} of the Pleistocene megafauna, Smilodon became extinct 10,000 years ago in the Quaternary {{extinction}} event. Its extinction has been linked to the decline and <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> large herbivores, which were replaced by smaller and more agile ones like deer. Hence, Smilodon could have been too specialized at hunting large prey and may have been unable to adapt. A 2012 study of Smilodon tooth wear found no evidence that they were limited by food resources. Other explanations include climate change and competition with humans (who entered the Americas around the time Smilodon disappeared), or a combination of several factors, all of which apply to the general Pleistocene extinction event, rather than specifically to the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> the saber-toothed cats.|$|E

5|$|Both the Rodrigues {{solitaire}} and the dodo are now extinct. A common {{threshold of}} the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> the dodo is 1662, but some possible sightings had been made as late as 1688. The last sighting with a description was in 1662, but a statistical analysis by Roberts and Solow found that the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> the dodo was in 1693. The Rodrigues solitaire was killed off later than the dodo. The IUCN uses an extinction date of 1778 for the solitaire, although a more probable date {{would be in the}} 1750s or 1760s. Both birds became extinct as a consequence of human hunting and the introduction of mammals that ate the birds and their eggs.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{have a high}} {{breeding}} rate. Under controlled breeding, {{they can}} be bred and shown as registered pedigree pets, a hobby known as cat fancy. Failure to control the breeding of pet cats by neutering, {{as well as the}} abandonment of former household pets, has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, requiring population control. In certain areas outside cats' native range, this has contributed, along with habitat destruction and other factors, to the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> many bird species. Cats have been known to extirpate a bird species within specific regions and {{may have contributed to the}} <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> isolated island populations. Cats are thought to be primarily responsible for the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> 33 species of birds, and the presence of feral and free-ranging cats makes some otherwise suitable locations unsuitable for attempted species reintroduction.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> Plesiorycteropus, but MacPhee assumed it may have {{happened}} around 1000 years ago, when the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> the rest of the subfossil fauna of Madagascar is thought to have concluded. Nothing like it was reported by 17th-century European explorers of the island, and one bone has been radiocarbon dated to around 2150 Before Present (200 BCE). Its extinction is somewhat anomalous, as other recently extinct Madagascan animals—such as subfossil lemurs, Malagasy hippopotamuses, the giant fossa, and elephant birds—were generally larger and not exclusively insectivorous; also, some species with likely more specialized diets, such as the falanouc (Eupleres goudoti) and aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), did survive. Early human colonists of Madagascar may have caused the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> Plesiorycteropus through the destruction of the forest and other disturbances.|$|E

There is no evidence of mass <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> these organisms, and there is support for high productivity of these species in southern high latitudes as a result of cooling temperatures in the early Paleocene. Approximately 46% of diatom species survived the transition from the Cretaceous to the Upper Paleocene.

5|$|Reductions in {{the size}} of host populations may cause a {{long-lasting}} reduction of louse taxonomic richness, for example, birds introduced into New Zealand host fewer species of lice there than in Europe. Louse sex ratios are more balanced in more social hosts and more female-biased in less social hosts, presumably due to the stronger isolation among louse subpopulations (living on separate birds) in the latter case. The <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> a species results in the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> its host-specific lice. Host-switching is a random event that would seem very rarely likely to be successful, but speciation has occurred over evolutionary time-scales so it must be successfully accomplished sometimes.|$|E

5|$|The {{radiocarbon}} dating of the skeletal remains from 56 Beringian wolves showed a continuous population from over 50,800 YBP until 12,500YBP, followed by one wolf dated at 7,600YBP. This indicates that their population was in decline after 12,500YBP, although megafauna was still available {{in this region}} until 10,500YBP. The timing of this latter specimen {{is supported by the}} recovery of mammoth and horse DNA from sediments dated 10,500 YBP–7,600 YBP from the interior of Alaska. The timing for the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> horses in North America and the minimum population size for North American bison coincide with the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> an entire wolf haplogroup in North America, indicating that the disappearance of their prey caused the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> this wolf ecomorph.

5|$|At {{the close}} of the Ice Age, with the loss of cold and dry {{conditions}} and the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> much of its prey, the Beringian wolf became extinct. The <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> its prey has been attributed to the impact of climate change, competition with other species, including humans, or a combination of both factors. Local genetic populations were replaced by others from within the same species or of the same genus. Of the North American wolves, only the ancestor of the modern North American gray wolf survived. The remains of ancient wolves with similar skulls and dentition have been found in western Beringia (north-east Siberia). In 2016 a study showed that some of the wolves now living in remote corners of China and Mongolia share a common maternal ancestor with one 28,000-year-old eastern Beringian wolf specimen.|$|E
