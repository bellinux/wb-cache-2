Currently there is no method or instrument that does verification {{of this type of}} spent <b>fuel</b> <b>assemblies</b> without moving the spent <b>fuel</b> <b>assemblies</b> from their storage positions. The proposed method uses a tiny neutron detector and a detector guiding system to collect neutron signals inside PWR spent <b>fuel</b> <b>assemblies</b> through guide tubes present in PWR assemblies. The data obtained in such a manner are used for gross defect verification of spent <b>fuel</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The method uses 'calibration curves' which show the expected neutron counts inside one of the guide tubes of spent <b>fuel</b> <b>assemblies</b> as a function of fuel burn-up.

25|$|The reactor {{consisted}} of 36 vertical U-tube fuel channels in a moderator tank which was 10feet {{in diameter and}} 16feet tall. Each leg of the U-tube contained one <b>fuel</b> <b>assembly</b> made up of 19 fuel rods.

25|$|Many of the {{internal}} components and <b>fuel</b> <b>assembly</b> cladding are made from zircaloy because it is relatively transparent to neutrons. At normal operating temperatures of approximately , zircaloy is inert. However, above 1200 degrees Celsius, zirconium metal can react exothermically with water to form free hydrogen gas. The reaction between zirconium and the coolant produces more heat, accelerating the reaction. In addition, zircaloy can react with uranium dioxide to form zirconium dioxide and uranium metal. This exothermic reaction together with the reaction of boron carbide with stainless steel can release additional heat energy, thus contributing to the overheating of a reactor.|$|E

25|$|The {{refueling}} {{machine is}} mounted on a gantry crane and remotely controlled.

25|$|Each {{test was}} able to {{simultaneously}} illuminate many targets, allowing them to test the amount of x-ray energy needed by placing the targets at different distances from the bomb. Another question was how large the <b>fuel</b> <b>assembly</b> {{had to be in}} order for the fuel to self-heat from the fusion reactions and thus reach ignition. Initial data were available by mid-1984, and the testing ceased in 1988. Ignition was achieved for the first time during these tests, but the amount of energy {{and the size of the}} fuel targets needed to reach ignition was far higher than predicted. During this same period, experiments began on Nova using similar targets to understand their behaviour under laser illumination, allowing direct comparison against the results obtained from the bomb tests.|$|E
25|$|On 12 May, TEPCO {{engineers}} {{confirmed that}} a meltdown occurred, with molten fuel having {{fallen to the}} bottom of the reactor's pressure vessel, or RPV. The utility said that fuel rods of the No. 1 reactor are fully exposed, with the water level 1meter (3.3feet) below the base of the <b>fuel</b> <b>assembly.</b> According to a Japanese press report, there are holes in the base of the pressure vessel – these holes were meant for the control-rods. After the fuel had melted, it produced holes in the bottom of the RPV, and then escaped into the containment vessel. In November 2011 TEPCO did not know the shape or porosity of the fuel mass, which is at the bottom of the containment vessel. As a result, it is impossible to know exactly how far the fuel mass would have eroded the concrete floor, but TEPCO estimate that no more than 70cm of a 7.6meter concrete slab was eroded away by the hot fuel. The production of heat and steam in unit 1 has decreased, as suggested by both radioactive decay calculations and photographic evidence (same source from TEPCO).|$|E

2500|$|The {{higher the}} energy of the gamma rays, the thicker the {{shielding}} made from the same shielding material is required. Materials for shielding gamma rays are typically measured by the thickness required to reduce the intensity of the gamma rays by one half (the half value layer or HVL). For example, gamma rays that require [...] (0.4″) of lead to reduce their intensity by 50% will also have their intensity reduced in half by [...] of granite rock, 6cm (2½″) of concrete, or 9cm (3½″) of packed soil. However, the mass of this much concrete or soil is only 20–30% greater than that of lead with the same absorption capability. Depleted uranium is used for shielding in portable gamma ray sources, but here the savings in weight over lead are larger, as portable sources' shape resembles a sphere to some extent, and the volume of a sphere is dependent on the cube of the radius; so a source with its radius cut in half will have its volume reduced by a factor of eight, which will more than compensate uranium's greater density (as well as reducing bulk). In a nuclear power plant, shielding can be provided by steel and concrete in the pressure and particle containment vessel, while water provides a radiation shielding of fuel rods during storage or transport into the reactor core. The loss of water or removal of a [...] "hot" [...] <b>fuel</b> <b>assembly</b> into the air would result in much higher radiation levels than when kept under water.|$|E
