40|$|In this work, {{we provide}} a {{framework}} linking microstructural properties of an asset to the tick value of the exchange. In particular, we bring to light a quantity, referred to as <b>implicit</b> <b>spread,</b> {{playing the role of}} spread for large tick assets, for which the effective spread is almost always equal to one tick. The relevance of this new parameter is shown both empirically and theoretically. This <b>implicit</b> <b>spread</b> allows us to quantify the tick sizes of large tick assets and to define a notion of optimal tick size. Moreover, our results open the possibility of forecasting the behavior of relevant market quantities after a change in the tick value and to give a way to modify it in order to reach an optimal tick size. 1 a...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{invokes the}} concept of an {{implicit}} bid-ask spread in the Irish Stock Market and measures the consequent cost to traders as the expected gap between the price of sell and buy orders when these have been executed {{with a high degree of}} immediacy. Use is made of the spread estimator due to Hsia, Fuller and Kao (1994). The analysis shows that many important empirical tests (including the calculation of a stock 2 ̆ 7 s beta coefficient), are distorted by the presence of the <b>implicit</b> <b>spread.</b> A spin-off of a practical nature is the provision of guide-lines for limit-prices...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the information content of trading intensity applying the Madhavan, Richardson and Roomans (1997) structural model to express trading intensity as trading momentum in duration and volume. Using both transactions and intraday {{data from the}} Helsinki Stock Exchange Limit Order Bookmarket, we find that momentum in duration and volume enhances the information effect. We reach this conclusion based on the parametric effect determined by the sign and {{the magnitude of the}} coefficients associated with the trading intensity variables, the trading effect determined by the ratio of transitory effects to permanent effects, and the economic effect determined {{by the size of the}} <b>implicit</b> bid–ask <b>spread.</b> While we find that the <b>implicit</b> bid–ask <b>spread</b> and transitory effects are decreasing toward the end of the trading day in consistency with information models in the literature, there is a surge of trades at the market close, most probably due to information uncertainty at market opening in New York.

We find that volatility at the open is greater than volatility at the close only for the most actively traded TSE stocks. Daytime and overnight return covariances suggest that the volatility patterns are explained by the effect of <b>implicit</b> bid-ask <b>spreads</b> at the open and partial price adjustment at the close, {{both of which are}} related to the intensity of trading.

40|$|SummaryTraditionally, {{research}} on visual {{attention has been}} focused on the processes involved in conscious, explicit selection of task-relevant sensory input. Recently, however, {{it has been shown that}} attending to a specific feature of an object automatically increases neural sensitivity to this feature throughout the visual field. Here we show that directing attention to a specific color of an object results in attentional modulation of the processing of task-irrelevant and not consciously perceived motion signals that are spatiotemporally associated with this color throughout the visual field. Such <b>implicit</b> cross-feature <b>spreading</b> of attention takes place according to the veridical physical associations between the color and motion signals, even under special circumstances when they are perceptually misbound. These results imply that the units of implicit attentional selection are spatiotemporally colocalized feature clusters that are automatically bound throughout the visual field...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with arbitrage opportunities in the futures and futures option contracts traded on the Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) within a put-call-futures-parity (PCFP) framework. Tick-by-tick transaction price data are employed so that the futures contracts, the call futures options and the put futures options can be matched within a one-minute interval. This paper also {{takes into account the}} realistic transaction costs that an arbitrager has to incur, including the <b>implicit</b> bid-ask <b>spread.</b> A thorough ex post analysis is first carried out. The results reveal a significant number of violations of the PCFP in the sample. Ex ante tests are then conducted whereby ex post profitable arbitrage strategies, signified by the matched trios of futures, put and call contracts, are executed with lags up to 3  min. The ex ante results are similar to the ex post results. However, further analysis reveals that the exploitability of the identified arbitrage opportunities is very limited due to the small trading volumes of the futures and options contracts. Thus, we conclude that there is no strong evidence against the arbitrage efficiency between the SPI index futures and options markets in Australia.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{an index}} that captures risk premiums of euro denominated assets based on sub-indices reflecting various credit <b>spreads,</b> <b>implicit</b> volatilities and bonds' excess return over stocks. The index reflects one common factor {{that accounts for}} general shifts in risk premiums across all markets. The development in the index {{is related to the}} business cycle, macroeconomic uncertainty and monetary policy. The risk index helps understand underlying market developments and can be applied in investment decisions - when the risk index rises (reflecting higher risk premiums), the level of the German yield curve falls, it becomes more flat and the curvature is reduced. The index also has use in the evaluation of financial stability. For instance, there is a tendency for the risk index to have more extreme tops than troughs, which indicates an asymmetry in investors' returns. Also, the covariation between sub-indices has risen since 1999, thereby indicating an increase in investors' vulnerability...|$|R
40|$|The article {{begins by}} {{retracing}} Italian economic developments from 1971 to 2001, a period marked by macroeconomic instability due to both external causes (the {{crisis of the}} fixed exchange rate system of Bretton Woods and the transition to floating rates, the oil shocks of 1974 and 1979) and domestic causes (labour conflict, political instability, the progressive degeneration of the public finances). Italian enterprises responded to economic disequilibria,wage pressures and the rigidity of the labour market by decentralizing the production process, which diminished the size of firms and shifted industrial activity from the North-West of Italy to the North-East and the South. These trends are documented in the Italian industrial censuses conducted from 1971 to 2001. Over these thirty years we find a contraction of industry,especially manufacturing, and a growth in services. Recent trends in services show that this sector has not yet realized the full potential for innovation <b>implicit</b> in the <b>spread</b> of the new information and communications technologies. The article concludes with a brief discussion of possible ways of reversing the tendencies {{of the past three}} decades, halting the industrial decline and relaunching Italian enterprise...|$|R

The choice of the existing bridge as the point of departure has meaning in two layers. layer one: {{the need for more}} space in the city of Seoul has initiated intense discussions on alternative building sites - underground cities. The choice of the bridge was made as yet another possible alternative. layer two: Seoul, like any other city, is full of urban attempts and failures. These mistakes and scars are taken as a point of departure, not as a point of destruction and restart. These structures have become our second nature, man-made nature. The existing bridge is one of the possible place for a new beginning. The program layers for the thesis began on the basis of disparities harmonies, and, chaos-order imbedded in Seoul. layer one : The need for 24 hour zone to accommodate various life styles in the mega city(not a single district is open for 24 hours).

40|$|Previous {{research}} indicates that implicit biases predict non-verbal behavior and that exposure to racially biased non-verbal messages can increase implicit bias against racial outgroups. Taken together, {{these findings suggest that}} implicit bias can be viewed as contagious. In other words, observers of non-verbal bias develop implicit bias, which is behaviorally expressed as non-verbal bias, leading to the development of implicit bias among those who observe them. Moreover, accompanying verbal messages may moderate the effects of non-verbal messages on bias development. The literature on persuasion suggests that pairing explicit verbal messages with non-verbal messages has the potential to interfere with the development of bias. ^ The overall aim of this research was to determine whether and under what conditions exposure to non-verbal bias results in implicit bias development. Hypothesis 1 was that exposure to non-verbal bias against a novel social target would result in implicit bias. Study 1 participants formed implicit biases, but not in the expected direction. However, they did demonstrate biased non-verbal behavior consistent with the observed non-verbal bias. In Studies 2 and 3 Hypothesis 1 was fully supported, providing evidence of social bias resulting from exposure to biased non-verbal behavior. Hypothesis 2 was that verbal messages that convey bias (positive or negative) would interfere with implicit bias development. Non-verbal messages were expected to have the strongest effect on implicit bias when paired with verbal messages, conveying equality among social targets. This hypothesis was fully supported in Studies 2 and 3, participants only showed evidence of non-verbal message consistent implicit bias in the neutral verbal message condition. The final goal of this research was to obtain neural evidence of bias development. Hypothesis 3 was that activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) would differentiate social targets. As predicted, participants showed less mPFC activation in response to targets of non-verbal bias relative to comparison targets, but only in the equality message condition. Results support the notion that <b>implicit</b> bias can <b>spread</b> via exposure to non-verbal bias, and that it is most contagious when paired with verbal equality messages. Implications of these findings and future directions for this research are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|Financial Derivatives {{are one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{emerging}} innovations in the field of financial engineering. Since their inception, there has been a phenomenal growth in the volumes of derivatives traded all over the world. Financial markets are known to be extremely volatile and derivatives provide a way of eliminating or reducing the risks involved in these markets. Since these instruments derive their value from some underlying asset, trading in these instruments is bound to affect the underlying assets. Thus it becomes important to examine what these effects are and whether they have been favourable or detrimental to the underlying stock markets specially when there has been an explosive growth of these financial derivatives all over the world. This issue gains more importance in the case of emerging markets like India as they try to be more competitive and efficient as the developed Western markets. This thesis mainly deals with looking at this impact on the Indian stock markets. The Indian markets still being very new in this area, not many studies have been reported here related to this issue. The main focus of this thesis is to provide some more evidence on the impact of one kind of derivative instrument, namely options on different characteristics of underlying stocks in the Indian stock market. The thesis has the following objectives: • To examine the impact of option introduction on the price of underlying stocks in National Stock Exchange (NSE). • To examine the impact of option introduction on the volatility of underlying stocks in NSE • To examine the impact of option introduction on liquidity of underlying stocks in NSE NSE introduced derivatives beginning with index futures on June 12, 2000, followed by index options on June 4, 2001, options on individual securities on July 2, 2001 and finally futures on individual securities on November 9, 2001. Due to the temporal proximity of the introduction of index options and individual options, there exists a possibility of an interaction of these two effects. This problem is solved by a judiciously chosen sampling design. In particular, three groups of stocks are considered. The first group consists of stocks on which options were first introduced on 2 nd July 2001 and thus would exhibit a combined effect of the two events if any. The second group consists of stocks on which options were introduced much later and therefore would show effects of individual option introduction if any. The third group comprises of nonoptioned stocks whose returns are considered around the date of index option introduction and thus would show effects of index option alone if any. To separate the two effects an ANOVA/ Logistic Regression model is used. An objective selection of the event and estimation windows is done using a Bayesian Change Point Analysis. The first part of the thesis looks at the effect of option introduction on the price of underlying stocks. A standard event study methodology as has been used in the literature is employed for this purpose. The study does not find any significant effect of option introduction on the prices. The second part of the thesis deals with the effect on volatility. Volatility is measured as the risk of a stock and as is done in the literature, three kinds of risk are looked at: total risk, systematic risk and the unsystematic risk. In case of the total risk, an F-test and an Ansari Bradley test is used to check for changes in the variance and scale parameters of market-adjusted continuously compounded returns of the stocks before and after option introduction. The results of these tests are recorded as a categorical variable taking on the value 0 for no change and 1 for a change and a Binomial Logistic Regression is used to separate the effects of the two events. Furthermore, after recording the results of the above mentioned tests as a categorical variable with three categories (0, 1, - 1), a Multinomial Logistic Regression is also used in order to estimate the direction of the change (increase, decrease or no change). The ratios of after to before total risks are also analyzed using an ANOVA model. The systematic risk is measured using three kinds of betas – OLS betas, Scholes-Williams betas and Fowler-Rorke betas. The differences in the before and after betas of every stock are modelled using an ANOVA model in order to separate the two effects as well as the interaction effect. The unsystematic risk is estimated by the conditional variances and the unconditional variances of ARMA and ARMA-GARCH models fitted to market model excess returns. The ANOVA model is used here as well. In addition to this, the before and after ARCH and GARCH coefficients of GARCH (1, 1) models fitted to the excess returns are also compared using the ANOVA model. The results indicate that individual options are leading to a decline in total risk however index options are causing an increase in total risk. The interaction effect is significant in this case thereby causing an increase in total risk in the Group I stocks. The OLS betas indicate that individual option introduction seems to have increased the systematic risk. The Scholes-Williams betas indicate that index option introduction seems to have increased the systematic risk. The Fowler Rorke betas on the other hand, do not show any significant impact of individual option or index option introduction. For all the three betas index options introduction seems to have no effect on the systematic risk. Though the interaction effect seems to be significant in all the three cases, it however does not significantly affect the systematic risk in Group I stocks. As regards the unsystematic risk, both the conditional and unconditional variances of ARMA models show a significant reduction for individual option introduction but index options do not have any significant impact on either one of these measures. In case of unconditional variances of ARMA-GARCH models, none of the effects come out as significant. While comparing the news and persistence coefficients of GARCH (1, 1) models, the news coefficients indicate that the due to index option introduction, stocks are becoming more efficient in terms of absorbing the news more rapidly. No significant effect of either event is found on the persistence coefficients. The last part of the thesis deals with the liquidity issue. Liquidity has been measured using two measures – relative volume (based on daily data) and <b>implicit</b> bid-ask <b>spread</b> given by Roll (1984) (calculated from intra-day data). In case of the liquidity measures, the Logistic Regression models are used i. e. a categorical variable with two or three categories obtained from the results of a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test for comparing the median volume and spread before and after option introduction, is used. It is found that for the relative volume, individual option introduction has led to a favourable effect in terms of increasing the volume post introduction of options; however index options seem to have had a negative effect. As for the spread, index options seem to have had a stabilizing influence on the underlying stocks than the individual options...|$|R
