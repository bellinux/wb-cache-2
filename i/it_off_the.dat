5|$|Later on 13 September 1942 Captain Lord Howard and Lieutenant Hall were hospitalised {{because of}} their injuries, while Winter and Desgranges were taken to Caen for interrogation.

5|$|McKinley {{had been}} elected {{for a second term}} in 1900. He enjoyed meeting the public, and was {{reluctant}} to accept the security available to his office. Secretary to the President George B. Cortelyou feared that an assassination attempt would take place during a visit to the Temple of Music and took <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> schedule twice. McKinley restored it each time.|$|E
5|$|Of the 332 {{people on}} board, 64 were rescued. Most {{of the crew}} and {{passengers}} were asleep {{at the time of}} attack and had little chance to escape. It was estimated that up to 200 people may have been alive at the time Centaur submerged. Several who made <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ship later died from shrapnel wounds or burns; others were unable to find support and drowned.|$|E
5|$|The S-IVB orbital {{workshop}} was {{the only}} one of these plans to make <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> drawing board. Dubbed Skylab, it was constructed complete on the ground rather than in space, and launched in 1973 using the two lower stages of a Saturn V. It was equipped with an Apollo Telescope Mount. Skylab's last crew departed the station on February 8, 1974, and the station itself re-entered the atmosphere in 1979.|$|E

5|$|American {{forces were}} quick to counter the attack. M20 {{recoilless}} rifles destroyed the machine gun positions, and American mortars began firing on any North Korean positions they could locate. However, North Korean forces {{were quick to}} advance up the Notch, to {{the crest of the}} hill that made up the pass. There, the discovered B Company, 19th Infantry, encamped. The 19th Infantry was apparently not prepared for combat, as North Korean forces were able to hit the American force and drive <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> hill, killing several of the American soldiers with bayonets. At about 12:00, B Company was driven from the crest of the Notch, and further confusion erupted when US Air Force aircraft accidentally strafed the retreating B Company. Neighboring positions also mistakenly attacked B Company, which retreated with 12 killed.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} that he {{developed}} the Baby Bombard and sent <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> War Office, Blacker was working for a government department known as MD1, which was given the task of developing and delivering weapons for use by guerilla and resistance groups in Occupied Europe. Shortly after the trial of the Baby Bombard, Blacker was posted to other duties, and left the anti-tank weapon {{in the hands of a}} colleague in the department, Major Millis Jefferis.|$|E
5|$|Fruit eating, or frugivory, {{is found}} in both major suborders. Bats prefer ripe fruit, pulling <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> trees with their teeth. They fly back to their roosts to eat the fruit, sucking out the juice and {{spitting}} the seeds and pulp out onto the ground. This helps disperse the seeds of these fruit trees, which may take root and grow where the bats have left them, and numerous species of plants depend on bats for seed dispersal. The Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) has been recorded carrying fruits weighing 3–14g (0.11–0.49oz) or even as much as 50g (1.8oz).|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the siege, Colonel John Carter was appointed governor of the castle and fresh repairs were carried out. In 1655 the Council of State appointed by Parliament ordered the castle to be slighted, or put beyond military use: the Bakehouse tower was probably deliberately partially pulled down at this time as part of the slighting. With the restoration of Charles II in 1660, Conway was returned to Edward Conway, the Earl of Conway, but five years later Edward decided to strip the remaining iron and lead from the castle and sell <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> work was completed under the supervision of Edward Conway's overseer William Milward, despite opposition from the leading citizens of Conwy, and turned the castle into a total ruin.|$|E

After accidentally driving <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> edge of a cliff, the family find themselves trapped in the woods. As Homer and Bart {{try to find a}} way back to civilization, Homer gets himself covered in mud and is mistaken for Bigfoot by a naturalist. The news about the encounter spreads quickly and Bigfoot hunters converge on the woods to capture Homer. Meanwhile, Maggie finds herself separated from the family and raised by bears.|$|E
5|$|India {{was also}} viewed as another {{potential}} operator of the Su-33. The Indian Navy planned {{to acquire the}} Su-33 for its aircraft carrier, the INS Vikramaditya, the refurbished Soviet Admiral Gorshkov, which was sold to India in 2004. In the end, the rival MiG-29K was opted for, because of the Su-33's outdated avionics. The size of the Su-33 reportedly led to concerns over potential difficulties in operating <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Indian carriers, a constraint not shared by the smaller MiG-29K.|$|E

5|$|Montagu {{selected}} the code name Mincemeat {{from a list}} of centrally held available possibilities. On 4 February 1943 Montagu and Cholmondeley filed their plan for the operation with the Twenty Committee; it was a re-working of Cholmondeley's Trojan Horse plan. The Mincemeat plan was to place documents on the corpse, and then float <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> coast of Spain, whose nominally neutral government was known to cooperate with the , the German military intelligence organisation. The plan was passed by the committee, who passed it up the chain of command to the senior Allied strategists; Montagu and Cholmondeley were ordered to continue with their preparations for the operation.|$|E
5|$|Sato and Reed {{return to}} Enterprise with the sad news that Archer {{did not make}} <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> weapon.

Surprised, T'Pol orders Tucker and Ensign Mayweather to fly a shuttlepod down to San Francisco, where they are {{suddenly}} attacked by what seem to be P-51s. The final scene switches to a World War II German field-hospital. A doctor summons some SS officers to examine the unfamiliar uniform of a burns patient who was recently brought in. The patient is revealed as Archer. One of the SS personnel steps out of the shadows, revealing himself to be a gray-skinned alien.|$|E
5|$|The BT46 was an {{aluminium}} alloy monocoque featuring the trapezoidal cross section common {{to many of}} Gordon Murray’s 1970s designs. It featured inbuilt pneumatic jacks fed from an external supply of compressed air to lift <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ground for tyre changes during practice. It employed a very early version of the carbon brakes that were in universal use by the mid-1980s—a concept taken from the aircraft industry. The system, which Brabham had been developing since 1976, combined carbon composite brake pads with a steel disc faced with carbon composite 'pucks'.|$|E

5|$|The event {{opened with}} a Shop of Horrors match between Abyss and Black Reign, which lasted 10 minutes and 13 seconds. In a Shop of Horrors match, all weapons are legal to use, a wrestler can not be counted out, and {{it can only be}} won by pinfall or submission. James Mitchell {{interfered}} on Reign's behalf during the encounter. Abyss won the contest by pinfall after slamming Reign into the mat with his maneuver, the Black Hole Slam. After the encounter, Abyss grabbed a key that hung around Reign's neck and used it to open a locked building on the stage, which unknowingly was occupied by an unknown wrestler. Reign and the unknown wrestler then proceeded to lock Abyss in the building and push <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> stage.|$|E
5|$|The {{fan base}} went wild, and a riotous celebration {{gathered}} at Ebisu Bridge in Dōtonbori, Osaka. There, {{an assemblage of}} supporters yelled the players' names, and with every name, a fan resembling {{a member of the}} victorious team leaped from the bridge into the waiting canal. However, lacking a Caucasian person to imitate MVP Randy Bass, the rabid crowd seized a plastic statue of Colonel Sanders (like Bass, the Colonel had a beard and was not Japanese) from a nearby KFC and tossed <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> bridge as an effigy.|$|E
5|$|The scandalous trick and {{the frank}} {{language}} have {{for much of}} the play's history kept <b>it</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> stage and out of print. Between 1753 and 1924, The Country Wife was considered too outrageous to be performed at all and was replaced on the stage by David Garrick's cleaned-up and bland version The Country Girl, now a forgotten curiosity. The original play is again a stage favourite today, and is also acclaimed by academic critics, who praise its linguistic energy, sharp social satire, and openness to different interpretations.|$|E
