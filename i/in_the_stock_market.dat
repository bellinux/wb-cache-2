In fact, McCarthy had invested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> himself during the war, netting a profit of $42,000 in 1943 (over $604,000 in 2017 dollars).

5|$|Little was not {{the first}} to gain and lose his fortune <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> but he was a {{pioneering}} speculator, the first to rely on his ability to predict market fluctuations to inform his speculations instead of bidding with what would today be considered insider information. He was the first Great Bear; before his rapid rise speculation and market manipulation was virtually unknown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> as no one before him had had the still nerve and financial foresight necessary to profit from such risky endeavors, and many market historians consider him the first modern stock market tycoon. His ability to gain and lose fortunes on a day-by-day basis was a microcosm of the meteoric possibilities and insecurities of speculation, and after his death and even during his life many other investors tried to imitate his success, with little success. His victory over the Erie Railroad scheme (and market cornering activities in general) inspired similar plots in the years thereafter; in 1863 the industrialist Cornelius Vanderbilt successfully cornered the Harlem Railroad {{in much the same way}} that Little had done almost thirty years earlier, and fell into a corner trap formed by Daniel Drew and others himself in the later Erie War. This did much to give credence to convertible bonds, then still a novelty.|$|E
5|$|Andrei Kolmogorov {{developed}} in a 1931 paper {{a large part of}} the early theory of continuous-time Markov processes. Kolmogorov was partly inspired by Louis Bachelier's 1900 work on fluctuations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> as well as Norbert Wiener's work on Einstein's model of Brownian movement. He introduced and studied a particular set of Markov processes known as diffusion processes, where he derived a set of differential equations describing the processes. Independent of Kolmgorov's work, Sydney Chapman derived in a 1928 paper an equation, now called the Chapman–Kolmogorov equation, in a less mathematically rigorous way than Kolmogorov, while studying Brownian movement. The differential equations are now called the Kolmogorov equations or the Kolmogorov–Chapman equations. Other mathematicians who contributed significantly to the foundations of Markov processes include William Feller, starting in the 1930s, and then later Eugene Dynkin, starting in the 1950s.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFeed-back models <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> {{research}} imply {{an adjustment}} process toward investors’ expectation for current information and past experiences. Error-correction and cointegration {{are often used}} to evaluate the long-run relation. The Efficient Capital Market Hypothesis, which had ignored the effect of the accumulation of information, cannot explain some anomalies such as bubbles and partial predictability <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets.</b> <b>In</b> order to investigate the feed-back mechanism and to determine an effective model, we use daily data of <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> index of two Chinese <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> with <b>the</b> expectational model, which is one kind of geometric lag models. Tests and estimations of error-correction show that long-run equilibrium seems to be seldom achieved in Chinese <b>stock</b> <b>markets.</b> Our result clearly shows the common coefficient of expectations and fourth-order autoregressive disturbance exist <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two Chinese <b>stock</b> <b>markets.</b> Furthermore, we find the same coefficient of expectations has an autoregressive effect on disturbances <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two Chinese <b>stock</b> <b>markets.</b> Therefore <b>the</b> presence of such feed-back is also supported in Chinese <b>stock</b> <b>markets...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} link between {{political}} news releases, and the returns and volatilities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> of Riga, Tallinn and Vilnius. Political news releases are viewed as proxies for political risk. The results indicate that political news events regarding domestic and foreign, excluding Russia, political issues led, on average, to lower uncertainty <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> of Riga and Tallinn in 2001 - 2003. At the same time, political risk from Russia increased the volatility of <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>in</b> Tallinn.

5|$|The 1997 Asian Financial Crisis {{affected}} the economy, {{resulting in a}} lingering decline {{of the value of}} the peso and falls <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market.</b> The extent it was affected initially was not as severe as that of some of its Asian neighbors. This was largely due to the fiscal conservatism of the government, partly as a result of decades of monitoring and fiscal supervision from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in comparison to the massive spending of its neighbors on the rapid acceleration of economic growth. There have been signs of progress since. In 2004, the economy experienced 6.4% GDP growth and 7.1% in 2007, its fastest pace of growth in three decades. Average annual GDP growth per capita for the period 1966–2007 still stands at 1.45% in comparison to an average of 5.96% for the East Asia and the Pacific region as a whole. The daily income for 45% of the population of the Philippines remains less than $2.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the asymmetric impact of innovations on volatility and the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> return and volatility dynamics <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of Central and Eastern European (CEE) markets using the framework of asymmetric stochastic volatility models. The empirical findings provide weak evidence of asymmetry, a significant and high volatility persistence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> of <b>the</b> CEE region. The most interesting and different results obtained from the present paper are that there are both of a high variability of volatility and a high volatility persistence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> of Poland and Lithuania. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> of <b>the</b> Czech Republic and Hungary, which have leverage effect, have lower variability of volatility and <b>in</b> these markets <b>the</b> future volatility is relatively certain as compared to <b>the</b> other <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> from <b>the</b> CEE region...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the idiosyncratic volatility puzzle and whether investor sentiment influences {{the relation between}} idiosyncratic volatility and <b>stock</b> returns <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chinese <b>stock</b> <b>market.</b> <b>The</b> findings indicate {{the existence of a}} negative idiosyncratic volatility effect. <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> results show that the relation between idiosyncratic volatility and returns significantly depends on investor sentiment. Thus, investor sentiment plays a very important role <b>in</b> reconciling <b>the</b> relation between idiosyncratic volatility and <b>stock</b> returns <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chinese <b>stock</b> <b>market.</b> This implies that investor sentiment {{may be one of the}} major risk factors that should be considered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chinese <b>stock</b> <b>market.</b> <b>In</b> terms of predictive ability of investor sentiment, idiosyncratic volatility and market volatility, the findings indicate that idiosyncratic volatility positively predicts future excess <b>market</b> returns <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chinese <b>stock</b> <b>market...</b>|$|R
