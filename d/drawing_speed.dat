40|$|AbstractThe {{hydrodynamic}} lubrication regime {{is reported to}} exist in numerous metal forming applications, such as wire drawing and hydrostatic extrusion, {{but it has not}} been achievable in the drawing of large diameter rods due to the relatively low <b>drawing</b> <b>speeds</b> common for larger parts. By creating a stable fluid film between the workpiece and the die during the drawing process friction and die wear could be significantly reduced, leading to energy savings, increased achievable reductions, and increased die life. An analytical model of the hydrodynamic drawing process is proposed which considers the geometry of the workpiece and die, as well as, the material properties (including work hardening effects), and (temperature dependent) fluid properties to determine the fluid film thickness over the reduction die. This model is then used to analyze several case studies, including a proposed multiple reduction die with high pressure lubricant supplied to the space between the dies. It is shown that a stable fluid film can be established for low <b>drawing</b> <b>speeds</b> through the combination of a multiple reduction die and elevated lubricant pressure in the inlet of the dies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A {{theoretical}} {{study of}} the die-less wire drawing {{was carried out in}} which the conventional die is replaced by a die-less conical orifice reduction unit. The process involves pulling the wire through the conical die-less unit which is filled with a polymer melt, the pulling action causes yielding of the continuum and a reduction in area is then obtained. A Newtonian behavior of the polymer melt and a rigid non-linear strain-hardening continuum were considered in which non-linear equations are formulated for the pressure and the stress increment in the die unit. A finite difference numerical technique was applied to solve these equations for the plasto-hydrodynamic pressure and the stress, which enabled prediction of the non-linear deformation profile of the continuum, the pressure distribution, and the percentage reduction in area for various <b>drawing</b> <b>speeds.</b> The maximum reduction in area for wire drawing is (5. 5 %).

The wires were drawn with different <b>drawing</b> <b>speed.</b> After drawing mechanical properties of wires were determined by the tensile test. In this work also FEM modelling was done.

The increase of <b>drawing</b> <b>speed</b> cause the increase of strength properties and decreasing of plasticity properties of wires.
