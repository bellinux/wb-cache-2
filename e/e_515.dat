40|$|Pediatric {{epilepsy}} {{caused by}} a KCNQ 2 gene mutation usually manifests as benign familial neonatal seizures (BFNS) during the 1 st week of life. However, the exact mechanism, phenotype, and genotype of the KCNQ 2 mutation are unclear. Methods: We studied the KCNQ 2 genotype from 75 nonconsanguineous patients with childhood epilepsy without an identified cause (age range: from 2 days to 18 years) and from 55 healthy adult controls without epilepsy. KCNQ 2 mutation variants were transfected into HEK 293 cells to investigate what functional changes they induced. Results: Four (5 %) of the patients had the <b>E</b> <b>515</b> D KCNQ 2 mutation, which the computer-based PolyPhen algorithm predicted to be deleterious. Their seizure outcomes were favorable, but three had an intellectual disability. Two patients with <b>E</b> <b>515</b> D presented with continuous spikes and waves during slow-wave sleep (CSWS), {{and the other two}} presented with BFNS. We also analyzed 10 affected family members with the same KCNQ 2 mutation: all had epilepsy (8 had BFNS and 2 had CSWS). A functional analysis showed that the recordings of the <b>E</b> <b>515</b> D currents were significantly different (p< 0. 05), which suggested that channels with KCNQ 2 <b>E</b> <b>515</b> D variants are less sensitive to voltage and require stronger depolarization to reach opening probabilities than those with the wild type or N 780 T (a benign polymorphism). Conclusion: KCNQ 2 mutations can cause various phenotypes in children: they lead to BFNS and CSWS. We hypothesize that patients with the KCNQ 2 <b>E</b> <b>515</b> D mutation are susceptible to seizures...|$|E

40|$|The hyperpolarization-activated Ih current, coded for by hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, {{controls}} synaptic {{integration and}} intrinsic excitability in many brain areas. Because {{of their role}} in pacemaker function, defective HCN channels are natural candidates for contributing to epileptogenesis. Indeed, Ih is pathologically altered after experimentally induced seizures, and several independent data indicate a link between dysfunctional HCN channels and different forms of epilepsy. However, direct evidence for functional changes of defective HCN channels correlating with the disease in human patients is still elusive. By screening families with epilepsy formutations inHcn 1 andHcn 2 genes, we found a recessive loss-of-function pointmutation in the gene coding for theHCN 2 channel in a patient with sporadic idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Of 17 screenedmembers of the same family, the proband {{was the only one}} affected and homozygous for the mutation. Themutation (<b>E</b> <b>515</b> K) is located in the C-linker, a region known to affect channel gating. Functional analysis revealed that homomeric mutant, but not heteromeric wild-type/mutant channels, have a strongly inhibited function caused by a large negative shift of activation range and slowed activation kinetics, effectively abolishing the HCN 2 contribution to activity. After transfection into acutely isolated newborn rat cortical neurons, homomeric mutant, but not heteromeric wild type/mutant channels, lowered the threshold of action potential firing and strongly increased cell excitability and firing frequency when compared with wild-type channels...|$|E
40|$|We have {{generated}} two site-directed mutants, K 504 <b>E</b> and K <b>515</b> <b>E,</b> in the alpha subunit of an amiloride-sensitive bovine epithelial Na+ channel, alpha bENaC. The region {{in which these}} mutations lie is in the large extracellular loop immediately before the second membrane-spanning domain (M 2) of the protein. We have found that when membrane vesicles prepared from Xenopus oocytes expressing either K 504 <b>E</b> or K <b>515</b> <b>E</b> alpha bENaC are incorporated into planar lipid bilayers, the gating pattern, cation selectivity, and amiloride sensitivity of the resultant channel are all altered {{as compared to the}} wild-type protein. The mutated channels exhibit either a reduction or a complete lack of its characteristic burst-type behavior, significantly reduced Na+:K+ selectivity, and an approximately 10 -fold decrease in the apparent inhibitory equilibrium dissociation constant (Ki) for amiloride. Single-channel conductance for Na+ was not affected by either mutation. On the other hand, both K 504 <b>E</b> and K <b>515</b> <b>E</b> alpha bENaC mutants were significantly more permeable to K+, as compared to wild type. These observations identify a lysine-rich region between amino acid residues 495 and 516 of alpha bENaC as being important to the regulation of fundamental channel properties.

40|$|Enterobacter sakazakii is an {{opportunistic}} pathogen {{that can}} cause infections in neonates. This study further clarifies the taxonomy of isolates described as E. sakazakii and completes {{the description of the}} proposed reclassification of these organisms as novel species and subspecies within a proposed novel genus, Cronobacter. The species was first defined in 1980, however recent polyphasic taxonomic analysis has determined that this group of organisms consists of several genomospecies. In this study the phenotypic descriptions of the proposed novel species are expanded using Biotype 100 and Biolog Phenotype MicroArray™. Further DNA-DNA hybridization experiments showed that malonate positive strains within the C. sakazakii genomospecies represent a distinct species not a subspecies. DNA-DNA hybridizations also determined that phenotypically different strains within proposed Cronobacter dublinensis sp. nov. belong to the same species and can be considered novel subspecies. Based on these analyses the following alternative classifications are proposed; Cronobacter sakazakii gen. nov. comb. nov., type strain ATCC 29544 T (=NCTC 11467 T); C. malonaticus sp. nov., type strain CDC 1058 - 77 T (= LMG 23826 T = DSMZ 18702 T); C. turicensis sp. nov., type strain z 3032 T (= LMG 23827 T = DSMZ 18703 T); C. muytjensii sp. nov., type strain ATCC 51329 T (= CIP 103581 T); C. dublinensis sp. nov., type strain DES 187 T (= LMG 23823 T = DSMZ 18705 T); C. dublinensis sp. nov. subsp. dublinensis subsp. nov., type strain DES 187 T; C. dublinensis sp. nov. subsp. lausannensis subsp. nov., type strain <b>E</b> <b>515</b> T (= LMG 23824 = DSMZ 18706 T); and C. dublinensis sp. nov. subsp. lactaridi subsp. nov. type strain E 464 T (= LMG 23825 T = DSMZ 18707 T) ...|$|E

Whereas various mutant human (h) NIS molecules display loss of function when expressed by transfection in mammalian cells, the precise mechanism(s) responsible for the functional abnormality of these proteins remains unknown. With the aim to explore these mechanisms in three natural hNIS mutants identified previously in patients with iodide trapping defect (Q 267 <b>E,</b> S <b>515</b> X, and C 272 X), we have prepared tools allowing direct measurement of the protein at its normal location in the plasma membrane. A COS- 7 cell line was made by transfection that stably expressed high levels of wild-type hNIS. It was used to screen by flow cytometry monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) prepared from mice immunized against hNIS. Genetic immunization was performed by im injection of a wild-type hNIS complementary DNA construct, because this procedure has demonstrated the ability to produce antibodies recognizing native membrane proteins. One mAb that recognized an epitope of hNIS exposed on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane was selected for further studies. The epitope was localized on the sixth putative extracellular loop of the protein {{on the basis that}} the mAb did not recognize rat NIS, which exhibits major sequence differences in this segment. When this mAb was used to test by flow cytometry the expression of the three mutant hNIS proteins in transfected COS- 7 cells, it detected similar amounts of wild-type, Q 267 E, and the S 515 X hNIS molecules in permeabilized cells. In contrast, only the wild-type hNIS was detected at the surface of nonpermeabilized cells. The C 272 X hNIS truncation mutant was not detected in intact or permeabilized cells. This is consistent with the absence of the mAb epitope from this mutant, which is expected to lack the sixth extracellular loop.

Analysis of extended triangle tests indicated that sensory judges distinguished significant differences between the control brownies and E 1 (p 3 ̆c 0. 001) and between the control and E 2 (p 3 ̆c 0. 001). The preference test showed that E 1 was preferred over E 2. The chewiness intensity test revealed no significant differences among the brownie formulations. Hydration brownie properties were investigated by analyzing the moisture content. The control brownies had a significantly higher moisture content than E 2 (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Textural properties of brownies were studied by penetration, compression, and retraction force. Brownie penetration, compression, and retraction force was significantly increased with E 1 than the control (p 3 ̆c 0. 01). E 2 compression and retraction force was significantly increased compared to the control (p 3 ̆c 0. 01). However, {{there were no significant differences}} in textural properties between E 1 and E 2.

40|$|The milk production, {{energy balance}} (EB), {{endocrine}} and metabolite profiles of 10 New Zealand Holstein Friesian (NZ) cows and 10 North American Holstein Friesian (NA) cows were compared. The NA cows had greater peak milk yields and total lactation milk yields (7387 v. 6208 kg; s. e. d. 5359), lower milk fat and similar protein concentrations {{compared with the}} NZ cows. Body weight (BW) was greater for NA cows compared with NZ cows throughout lactation (596 v. 544 kg; s. <b>e.</b> d. <b>515.</b> 5), while body condition score (BCS) tended to be lower. The NA strain tended to have greater dry matter intake (DMI) (17. 2 v. 15. 7 kg/day; s. e. d. 50. 78) for week 1 to 20 of lactation, though DMI {{as a proportion of}} metabolic BW was similar for both strains. No differences were observed between the strains in the timing and magnitude of the EB nadir, interval to neutral EB, or mean daily EB for week 1 to 20 of lactation. Plasma concentrations of glucose and insulin were greater for NA cows during the transition period (day 14 pre partum to day 28 post partum). Plasma IGF-I concentrations were similar for the strains at this time, but NZ cows had greater plasma IGF-I concentration from day 29 to day 100 of lactation, despite similar calculated EB. In conclusion, {{the results of this study}} do not support the premise that the NZ strain has a more favourable metabolic status during the transition period. The results, however, indicate that NZ cows begin to partition nutrients towards body reserves during mid-lactation, whereas NA cows continue to partition nutrients to milk production. peer-reviewedNational Development Plan Irelan...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTargeting the HIV {{entry and}} {{assembly}} pathways holds promise {{for development of}} novel anti-HIV gene therapy vectors. We characterized discrete dominant negative (DN) Gag and Envelope mutants for their anti-HIV- 1 activity. We show here that capsid mutants (Q 155 N and Y 164 A) are more potent inhibitors of WT HIV than the matrix mutant 1 GA. Both the Envelope mutants tested, V 513 <b>E</b> and R <b>515</b> A, were equally effective and a combination of Gag and Envelope DN genes significantly enhanced potency. Interestingly, the DN mutants acted at multiple steps in the virus life cycle rather than solely disrupting virus release or infection. Inhibition mediated by R 515 A could be partially attributed to the Envelope cytoplasmic tail, as deletion of R 515 A tail partially abrogated its DN effect. Finally, the Y 164 A/R 515 A double mutant expressed in a lentiviral vector was effective at inhibiting HIV replication in CD 34 + hematopoietic stem cell-derived macrophages, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of our approach...|$|R

The DASI system was located at Skibotn (69.35 ° N, 20.36 ° <b>E),</b> approximately <b>51.5</b> km (44.1 km east and 26.5 km south) from EISCAT. The imager was pointing {{into the local}} zenith with a field of view of 50 °. Narrow-band optical filters at 630 -nm (O 1 D, 15 : 40 to 17 : 00 UT) and 557.7 -nm filters (O 1 S, 17 : 00 to 17 : 50 UT) were used with 10 -s integration time. The camera location and orientation was calibrated using the known locations of {{the stars in the}} sky for any time. The lens third-order angular transfer function was also computed by fitting the star positions. From these outcomes, the EISCAT pump beam was mapped onto the image for any beam pointing direction and altitude. Ray tracing through the ionosphere was used to determine the HF beam refraction, which resulted in some deviation from the straight line of sight. The last image from a pump-off period was used for background subtraction of all subsequent images of the following pump-on period. Where there was no pump-off period, the image for the + 12 ° north position served as the background image for all other pump beam pointing directions. The changing background image was necessary to compensate for the effect of changing twilight after sunset. Both background and data images were filtered using a 3 [*]×[*] 3 median filter to reduce pixel noise. Both optical wavelengths (557.7 and 630.0 nm) were calibrated in absolute Rayleighs (1 R[*]=[*] 1010 ph.m− 2.s− 1) using a standard radioactive fluorescent source. The same source was used to determine the lens transmission loss as a function of viewing angle.|$|R

In YB_ 6 ^ 11 B (I= 3 / 2) NMR spectra reveal patterns typical for an axially symmetric field gradient with a quadrupole coupling frequency of ν_Q= 600 ± 15 kHz. In the second boride (YB_ 4) three different EFGs were observed corresponding to the three inequivalent crystallographic sites for the boron atoms (4 h, 4 e, and 8 j). They correspond to: ν_Q(4 h) = 700 ± 30 kHz with an asymmetry parameter η= 0. 02 ± 0. 02, ν_Q(4 <b>e)</b> = <b>515</b> ± 30 kHz, η= 0. 00 + 0. 02 /- 0. 00, and ν_Q(8 j) = 515 ± 40 kHz, η= 0. 46 ± 0. 08. The Knight shifts measured by Magic-Angle Spinning (MAS) NMR at room temperature are very small being 0. 6 ± 8 ppm and - 1 ± 8 ppm for YB_ 4 and YB_ 6, respectively. For the theoretical calculations structure optimizations were performed as a first step. For the obtained structural parameters the EFGs were computed within the local-density approximation. Very satisfactory agreement between experimental and theoretical results is obtained both for the structural parameters and the B EFGs thus confirming the underlying structural models. In addition to the EFGs, band structures, densities of states, and valence-electron densities are presented and the bonding situation in the two yttrium borides is discussed. The band-structure results are compatible with the very low values for the Knight shifts mentioned above. Comment: 22 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

The MS consists of three brushless motors controlled by a dedicated software either separately or simultaneously reproducing the three main cardiac wall movements (R, L, RT) obtained by implementing different physiologic or pathologic velocity profiles derived from in vivo data.

The MS reproduced the tested velocity profiles well. The GS showed high accuracy in measuring both physiologic and pathologic RT velocity profiles, whereas they proved insensitive to R and L motions. GS axis inclination influenced measurements; however, it was possible to correct this taking the inclination angle cosine into account.

We describe a novel PCR method to detect and distinguish these lineages rapidly. Three hundred and eighteen published E. coli genomes were compared, to identify signature sequences unique to each of the four major STs. The specificity of these sequences was assessed in silico by seeking them in an additional 98 genomes. A PCR assay was designed to amplify size-distinguishable fragments unique to the four lineages, and was validated using <b>515</b> <b>E.</b> coli isolates of known ST. Genome comparisons identified 22 regions, ranging in size from 335 bp to 26. 5 kb, unique to one or other of the four predominant E. coli STs, with two to ten specific regions per ST. These regions predominantly harbored genes encoding hypothetical proteins and were within or adjacent to prophage sequences. Most (13 / 22) were highly conserved (> 96. 5 % identity) in genomes of the respective ST. The new assay identified correctly all of 142 representatives of the four major STs in the validation set (n= 515), with only two ST 12 isolates misidentified as ST 95. Compared with MLST, the assay thus had 100 % sensitivity and 99. 5 % specificity.

The ability to effectively track the sources of pollution within a watershed is imperative for proper risk assessment and remedial efforts to be evaluated and enacted. Several microbiological, genotypic, phenotypic, and chemical methods have been proposed as useful tools for tracking the sources of fecal pollution. Here, we describe the effective use of the ribotyping microbial source tracking procedure to determine the source(s) of Escherichia coli within a South Carolina watershed. In this study, 92 % of animal-derived E. coli isolates collected were correctly classified as being of animal origin using our existing ribotype profile database. These {{results suggest that the}} temporal and spatial diversity of E. coli may not be a significant factor in broad source (human versus animal) classification of E. coli by using our ribotyping DNA fingerprinting procedure. In addition, direct matching of ribotype profiles from water samples to those from known animal sources was used as an index of the potential predominant sources of fecal input(s) into this watershed. This method was useful in assessing possible specific animal sources when statistical analysis of a ribotype profile indicated general animal fecal pollution. Prior to investigating potential fecal inputs into this watershed, a significant human source was suspected as the primary input; however, of the <b>515</b> <b>E.</b> coli isolated from water samples collected {{during the course of this}} study, 88 % were typed as being of animal fecal origin.

Analisou-se também a estrutura da folha e do caule de ramos com e sem sintomas visuais da bactéria, sendo estimada a porcentagem de obstrução dos vasos do xilema do caule. Os ramos infectados apresentaram um encurtamento dos entrenós e, com o agravamento da doença, senescência foliar precoce na sua base, resultando em pequeno número de folhas no ápice. O número e a posição dos ramos por indivíduo com tais sintomas variaram entre as plantas, sendo mais freqüentes na região basal. Esses ramos também mostraram pecíolos e área foliar reduzidos e frutos menores e agrupados, em vista de um encurtamento dos pedicelos e dos entrenós, além de uma deposição de "goma" nos vasos do xilema do caule, pecíolo e folha, assim como divisões celulares anormais no xilema, floema e córtex daquelas partes. As células do mesofilo das folhas afetadas apresentaram número reduzido de cloroplastos, associado a maior concentração de cristais de oxalato de cálcio. Sugere-se que a presença da bactéria esteja induzindo a senescência foliar que se relaciona a um ou mais fatores de estresse. Leaf {{and stem}} {{anatomical}} changes were studied in coffee plants infected with X. fastidiosa {{looking for the}} causes of the observed physiological disturbances. Samples of commercial cultivars of Coffea arabica L. were analysed - Catuaí Vermelho IAC H 2077 - 25 - 81 and Mundo Novo 515 - 20 grafted on the progenie IAC 2258 of C. canephora - and of Catuaí Vermelho IAC H 2077 - 25 - 81 without grafting. Samples were collected in the field, at the Centro Experimental de Campinas, Instituto Agronômico, State of São Paulo, Brazil, in a coffee plantation where the presence of the bacteria was detected. The leaf and stem structures of branches with and without visual symptoms of the bacteria were analysed. It was also estimated the percentage of obliterated stem xylem vessels. The infected branches presented internode shortening, and early foliar senescence in the base of the branches, in a more severe degree of the disease, resulting in a reduced number of leaves in the apex. The number and position of branches with symptoms varied among plants, but were more frequent in the lower parts of the plants. These branches also presented reduced petiole and leaf area, smaller and grouped fruits due to the pedicels and internodes shortening. A deposition of "gum" was observed in the xylem vessels of the stems, petioles and leaves, and an abnormal cellular division in the xylem, phloem and cortex of the stem, petiole and in the mesophyll. The leaf mesophyll cells also presented reduced chloroplast number, associated with a larger concentration of calcium oxalate crystals. It was suggested that the presence of the bacteria may induce leaf senescence which is related to one or more stress factors...|$|R
