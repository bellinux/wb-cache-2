His first competitive match was a Ligue 1 away match against Angers on 28 November 2015, which ended in a 2-0 win for Angers. When Antonetti took over as head coach, Lille was in 17th position in the Ligue 1 table. After struggling {{during the first three}} months of Antonetti's tenure, Lille finished the season superbly, finishing fifth in the 2015-16 Ligue 1 and runners-up to Paris Saint-Germain in the 2015-16 Coupe de la Ligue. At the end of August 2016, he signed an extension to his contract that would tie him to the club until 30 June 2020. On 22 November 2016, the club announced that they had parted company with Antonetti and that he had agreed to leave [...] "in a friendly manner". Antonetti would receive a severance payout of about 840,000 euros, which was equivalent to seven months of his <b>gross</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>salary</b> of 120,000 euros.

50|$|Generally, {{the notice}} period in Bulgaria is 30 days, {{provided}} no agreement {{for a longer}} notice period has been reached (for a maximum of 3 months). Art. 329 of the Labour Code allows the employer to exercise the so-called suffrage (social choice) in cases of termination for partial enterprise dissolution operation, staff reduction or decrease in the volume of work. The employer may release those workers whose jobs {{are not subject to}} reduction, and retain instead employees with higher job performance level or qualifications if he deems that to be {{in the best interest of}} the enterprise. The proper conduct of these elections is a condition for the legality of the termination of the employment contract. Employers in Bulgaria can terminate the employment relationship in accordance with Art.330 para. 1 and para. 2 of the LC extraordinarily and without notice. This right arises, inter alia: during the arrest of the employee for the purpose of enforcement of a criminal conviction; when the employee is denied the right to exercise certain profession by a court or other state bodies; in withdrawing the academic degree of the employee which has been decisive for the conclusion of the employment contract; in withdrawal of the worker from the appropriate professional register (e.g. pharmacists, doctors, etc.); if the employee is released on disciplinary grounds. In Bulgaria, the employer may offer the employee to terminate the employment contract for payment of severance payment. If the employee does not accept in writing this offer within a period of 7 days, this is considered a rejection of the offer. If the worker accepts the offer, the employer is obliged to pay a compensation in the amount no less than four times his last <b>gross</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>salary.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1901, Bogard {{became the}} editor/half-owner of the Arkansas Baptist newspaper. Three {{years later he}} secured {{editorial}} control of the publication. In 1905, he left the Southern Baptist Convention to become for nineteen years, as it developed, an Independent Baptist. Nearly two decades later, he worked to establish the ABA, or the Missionary Baptist denomination, which dispatches missionaries not through an associational body like the SBC authorizes but through individual churches. In 1899, Bogard came to Arkansas. For his first four years there, he was the pastor of First Baptist Church in Searcy in White County near {{the capital city of}} Little Rock. Between 1903 and 1909, he was the pastor of First Baptist Church in Argenta, now North Little Rock in Pulaski County. Then he preached independently in revivals and crusades in seven states. In 1914, he moved to Texarkana in Miller County, Arkansas, where he founded The Baptist Commoner. In 1917, he merged The Baptist Commoner with the Arkansas Baptist to create The Baptist and Commoner. In 1920, he assumed his final pastorate at Antioch Missionary Baptist Church in Little Rock, where he remained until retirement in 1947. At the time, no Missionary Baptist pastor earned more than the $100 <b>gross</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>salary</b> paid to Bogard by Antioch Church. During the 1920s, Bogard joined the Ku Klux Klan, which targeted in that phase of its existence foreigners and Roman Catholics. Bogard claimed that the theory of evolution had contributed to the moral decline of the United States. In 1926, Bogard joined with Doss Nathan Jackson to write Evolution: Unscientific and Unscriptural, which claims that Darwin's's theory causes discouraged persons to turn to atheism and Bolshevism. Bogard and Jackson subsequently broke fellowship when Jackson's father-in-law, C. A. Gilbert, the chairman of the Missionary Baptist Sunday School Committee, was blamed for a deficit. For a decade Bogard tried to remove Gilbert as the committee chairman. In 1950, Jackson left the Missionary Baptist denomination and started the Baptist Missionary Association of America, formerly the North American Baptist Association. [...] In 1927, the Arkansas State Senate tabled an anti-evolution bill. Bogard led a petition drive to place the issue on the ballot as Initiated Act No. 1 in the general election held on November 6, 1928. In the campaign Bogard unexpectedly found himself defending the right of free speech of Charles Lee Smith, the {{founder and president of the}} since defunct American Association for the Advancement of Atheism who opposed the initiated act and had been charged with blasphemy while distributing atheist literature in Little Rock. Bogard was convinced that his conservative ideas would prove superior to those of Smith in an honest forum. Arkansas voters defied their state senators and passed the anti-evolution act by a two-to-one margin and also supported the Democratic presidential nominee Al Smith, the governor of New York, though Bogard had been among the southern clergy who opposed this first ever Catholic nominee of a major party despite U.S. Senator Joseph T. Robinson of Arkansas being tapped as Smith's vice-presidential running mate. Even before the term civil rights was widely used, Bogard believed that Al Smith as president would work for equality of African Americans in the still racially segregated American South. Though successful in Arkansas, the Smith-Robinson ticket was defeated by the Republican Hoover-Curtis slate.|$|E

40|$|Wages and {{salaries}} represent important economic terms whose amount characterizes {{the standard of}} living of the population in a given territory. These terms are related to everyone who had ever decided or is going to enter into an employment relationship, which is the vast majority of population. For these reasons my bachelor thesis deals with analysis of wages {{and salaries}} in the capital city of Prague. Wages and salaries are explored in this thesis by using the indicators of <b>gross</b> <b>monthly</b> wages and <b>salaries.</b> The development of medians of these indicators is evaluated through graphs, basic characteristics of time series, indices and suitable trend function. The development of wages will be examined from 2001 to 2013 and salaries from 2004 to 2013. Further for 2013 the indicators are divided into groups according to socio-economic characteristics of employees. Medians of these groups are compared with each other. Furthermore, wage and salary differentiation is examined. The analysed data are obtained from the Average Earnings Information System. This thesis should provide the information about wage and salary situation in the capital city for the reader.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} French couples’ labour market {{behaviour}} {{over the last}} thirteen years, from 1990 to 2002. We find {{that the proportion of}} dual earners couples has been steadily rising over time. Joint activity rates have gone up from 52 % in 1990 to over 58 % in 2002. About a fifth of women in dual earners couples in our sample earns a higher <b>gross</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>salary</b> than their husbands. The proportion of male breadwinners couples has diminished steadily overtime, from 30 % in 1990 to 22 % in 2002; while that of female breadwinners has increased from 5 % to 7 %. We provide some descriptive and exploratory analysis of the determinants of the labour market states of spouses, accounting for class endogamy as well as for changing macroeconomic conditions. W e find that class endogamy is an important determinant of the labour market states occupied by spouses. Wives that earn more than their husbands are either low-educated women with a low-educated husband or high-educated women.

40|$|Although {{there are}} a variety of studies on the gender pay gap, only a few relate to {{managerial}} positions. The present study attempts to fill this gap. Managers in private companies in Germany are a highly selective group of women and men, who differ only marginally in their human capital endowments. The Oaxaca/Blinder decomposition shows that the gender pay gap in the <b>gross</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>salary</b> can hardly be explained using the human capital approach. Adding variables on gender-specific labor market segregation and dimensions of the household and family to the model allows more than two-thirds of the gender pay gap to be explained. However, taking selection effects in a managerial position into account (Heckman correction), the proportion explained decreases to only one-third. This reveals the real extent to which women are disadvantaged on the labor market. In addition, we observe not only that the wages in typical women's jobs are lower than in typical men's jobs but also that women are paid less than men in typical women's jobs. The two-thirds of the gender pay gap that remain unexplained represent the unobserved heterogeneity. This includes, for example, general societal and cultural conditions as well as structures and practices on the labor market and in companies that subject women to pay discrimination and pose an obstacle to them breaking the glass ceiling.

50|$|In 2005 {{the labour}} force was {{estimated}} at 3.3 million; in 2004, 11 percent worked in agriculture, 33 percent in industry, and 56 percent in services. The unemployment rate has been in double digits throughout the post-communist era, reaching a high point of 19 percent in 2000. Since then, the rate has decreased substantially {{with the creation of}} new jobs in private and state enterprises. In 2005 the official figure was 11.5 percent, compared with 16.9 percent at the end of 2002. However, in 2003 an estimated 500,000 Bulgarians were unemployed but not officially counted because they were not seeking work. In January 2005, the government raised the minimum wage by 25 percent, to US$90 per month. The largest labour unions are Podkrepa (Support) and the Confederation of Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria. They represent labour in the National Council for Tripartite Partnership, in which they join government and business representatives to discuss issues of labour, social security, and living standards. The unions were an important political force in the fall of the Zhivkov regime. In late autumn of 2016 reported an unemployment rate of 7%.
