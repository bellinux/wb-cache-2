5|$|In {{the volcano}} {{disaster}} movie The Devil at 4 O'Clock (1961), Tracy played a priest {{for the fourth}} time in his career. His co-star, Frank Sinatra, ceded top-billing to guarantee Tracy for the picture. Continuing his pattern of indecisiveness, Tracy briefly pulled out of the production before recommitting. Critics were unenthusiastic about the film, which was nevertheless Tracy's most successful box office outing since <b>Father</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bride.</b>|$|E
5|$|In England {{he met the}} King {{on several}} {{occasions}} and dined {{with a number of}} influential British politicians, including William Pitt, Charles James Fox and Edmund Burke. Metternich was nominated the new Minister Plenipotentiary to the Austrian Netherlands and left England in September 1794. Unfortunately, he found an exiled and powerless government in headlong retreat from the latest French advance. In October a revitalised French army swept into Germany and annexed all of the Metternich estates except Königswart. Disappointed, and affected by strong criticism of his father's policies, he joined his parents in Vienna in November. On 27 September 1795 he married Countess Eleonore von Kaunitz, a granddaughter of former Austrian chancellor Wenzel Kaunitz. The marriage was arranged by Metternich's mother and introduced him to Viennese society. This was undoubtedly part of the motivation for Metternich, who demonstrated less affection for her than she for him. Two conditions were imposed by the <b>father</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bride,</b> Prince Kaunitz: first, the still youthful Eleonore was to continue to live at home; and second, Metternich was forbidden from serving as a diplomat as long as the Prince was still alive. Their daughter Maria was born in January 1797.|$|E
5|$|Periyar {{fought against}} the {{orthodox}} traditions of marriage as suppression of women in Tamil Nadu and throughout the Indian sub-continent. Though arranged marriages were meant to enable a couple to live together throughout life, it was manipulated to enslave women. Much worse was the practice of child marriages practised throughout India at the time. It was believed {{that it would be}} a sin to marry after puberty. Another practice, which is prevalent today, is the dowry system where the bride's family is supposed to give the husband a huge payment for the bride. The purpose of this was to assist the newly wedded couple financially, but in many instances dowries were misused by bridegrooms. The outcome of this abuse turned to the exploitation of the bride's parents wealth, and in certain circumstances, lead to dowry deaths. There have been hundreds of thousands of cases where wives have been murdered, mutilated, and burned alive because the <b>father</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bride</b> was unable to make the dowry payment to the husband. Periyar fiercely stood up against this abuse meted out against women.|$|E

25|$|The Vestals were {{committed}} to the priestesshood before puberty (when 6–10 years old) and sworn to celibacy {{for a period of}} 30 years. These 30 years were divided in turn into decade-long periods during which Vestals were respectively students, servants, and teachers. Afterwards, they were retired and replaced by a new inductee. Once retired, a former Vestal was given a pension and allowed to marry. The Pontifex Maximus, acting as the <b>father</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bride,</b> would typically arrange a marriage with a suitable Roman nobleman. A marriage to a former Vestal was highly honoured, and – more importantly in ancient Rome – thought to bring good luck, as well as a comfortable pension.|$|E

The film was the biggest commercial success of Tracy's career to date, earning $6 million worldwide. MGM wanted a sequel, and while Tracy was unsure, he accepted. Father's Little Dividend (1951) was released ten months later and performed well at the box office. On the strength of the two movies, Tracy polled as one of the nation's top stars once again.|$|E

50|$|By <b>the</b> second decade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thirteenth century, Ruaidhrí {{may have}} been <b>the</b> {{principal}} member <b>of</b> Clann Somhairle, and appears to have overseen an important marital alliance with the two foremost members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Crovan dynasty. For example, Rǫgnvaldr, and his younger half-brother Óláfr (died 1237), are recorded to have married <b>the</b> daughters <b>of</b> an unidentified nobleman from Kintyre, {{and the fact that}} Ruaidhrí and his father are known to have been styled Lord of Kintyre suggests that either man could have been <b>the</b> <b>father</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brides.</b> <b>The</b> marital alliance appears to have been orchestrated in an effort to patch up relations between Clann Somhairle and the Crovan dynasty, neighbouring kindreds who had bitterly contested <b>the</b> kingship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Isles for about sixty years. It is possible that Rǫgnvaldr's kingship was formally recognised by Ruaidhrí, who thereby established himself as a leading magnate within a reunified Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Isles. Since <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> Ruaidhrí's territories appear to have been mainland possessions, it is very likely that the Scottish Crown regarded this reunification as a threat to its own claims of overlordship of Argyll. Apprehension of this rejuvenated island realm {{may have been}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> factors that led to Ruaidhrí's apparent expulsion from Kintyre by <b>the</b> royal forces <b>of</b> Alexander II, King of Scotland (died 1249) in the early 1220s.|$|R

5000|$|According to Gail Omvedt, Virashaivism (Heroic Shaivism) under Basava was {{fiercely}} monotheistic {{and also}} free of temple worship—the Virashaiva devotees instead substituted a linga (phallus) image worn {{on the body}} and symbolising Shiva (hence the term Lingayat). The movement also decisively rejected caste. Not only did Basava accept people from all castes into his new community, but he himself proclaimed his rejection of his Brahmin birth and his kinship with the oppressed castes. [...] "Our Cannayya, the untouchable, is my father and our Kakkayya, the tanner, is my uncle" [...] (in Schouten 1995, 52). Many vachanas from the twelfth century movement—often by oppressed castes and untouchables themselves—proclaimed equality, and Basava's uncompromising attitude was prominent: [...] "What does it mean which background you have? He who wears <b>the</b> linga <b>of</b> Siva is well-born! Should we inquire about the background among the devotees, after the castes have been mixed?" [...] (Schouten 1995, 55). <b>The</b> radicalism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early movement culminated in a marriage between a formerly untouchable boy and a formerly Brahmin girl, which <b>the</b> orthodox section <b>of</b> society condemned and opposed. <b>The</b> <b>fathers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bride</b> and groom were sentenced to death by the king and dragged by an elephant through <b>the</b> streets <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town, {{which led to a}} full-fledged revolt by the oppressed castes.
