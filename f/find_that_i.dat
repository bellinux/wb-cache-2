She told Talk magazine:Every day I encounter some sort of anti-American feeling. Over the summer, I thought I would seek out non-Americans as friends, just for diversity's sake. Now I <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{want to be around}} Americans – people who I know are thinking about our country as much as I am.|$|E
500|$|Coward's most {{important}} relationship, {{which began in}} the mid-1940s and lasted until his death, was with the South African stage and film actor Graham Payn. Coward featured Payn in several of his London productions. Payn later co-edited with Sheridan Morley a collection of Coward's diaries, published in 1982. Coward's other relationships included the playwright Keith Winter, actors Louis Hayward and Alan Webb, his manager Jack Wilson and the composer Ned Rorem, who published details of their relationship in his diaries. Coward had a 19-year friendship with Prince George, Duke of Kent, but biographers differ on whether it was platonic. Payn believed that it was, although Coward reportedly admitted to the historian Michael Thornton that there had been [...] "a little dalliance". Coward said, on the duke's death, [...] "I suddenly <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> loved him more than I knew." ...|$|E
500|$|Hobart {{was more}} {{assertive}} as Senate president than his predecessors had been. [...] It was customary {{for the vice}} president not to rule on disputed points, but to submit them to a vote. [...] Hobart, with his experience as a presiding officer in the New Jersey Legislature, took a more assertive role, ruling on disputes, and trying to expedite legislation. [...] Hobart was initially diffident in his role, feeling himself unproven beside longtime national legislators, but soon gained self-confidence, writing in a letter that [...] "I <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am as good and as capable as any of them. [...] If they know a whole lot of things I don't know, I also know a whole lot of things they don't know. And there is a common humanity running through them all that makes us all as one, after all." [...] Hobart was so successful at guiding the administration's legislative agenda through the Senate that he became known as the [...] "assistant President".|$|E

500|$|Britten's early musical {{life was}} {{dominated}} by the classical masters; his mother's ambition was for him to become the [...] "Fourth B" [...] – after Bach, Beethoven and Brahms. Britten was later to assert that his initial development as a composer was stifled by reverence for these masters: [...] "Between the ages of thirteen and sixteen I knew every note of Beethoven and Brahms. I remember receiving the full score of Fidelio for my fourteenth birthday... But I think in a sense I never forgave them for having led me astray in my own particular thinking and natural inclinations". He developed a particular animosity towards Brahms, whose piano music he had once held in great esteem; in 1952 he confided that he played through all Brahms's music from time to time, [...] "to see if I am right about him; I usually <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> underestimated last time how bad it was!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Campbell {{declined}} {{a number}} of positions in the CSA government, but accepted the post of Assistant Secretary of War in 1862. For {{the duration of the}} job, Campbell was criticized for trying to limit the scope of wartime conscription. [...] By late 1864, he was pushing again {{for an end to the}} war. In an 1865 letter to Judge Benjamin R. Curtis, he described the disastrous state of the Confederacy and marveled: [...] "You would suppose there could be no difficulty in convincing men under such circumstances that peace was required. But when I look back upon the events of the winter, I <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was incessantly employed in making these facts known and to no result." ...|$|E

2500|$|I {{realize that}} I shouldn't be {{surprised}} at God's doing things that I can't explain. [...] I shouldn't doubt His existence just because I <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> sometimes can't understand why or how He has made something. [...] I know that my nature is weak and limited and that God's is limitless, incomprehensible, and infinite, and, from this, I can infer that He can do innumerable things whose reasons are unknown to me. [...] On this ground alone, I regard the common practice of explaining things {{in terms of their}} purposes to be useless in physics: it would be foolhardy of me to think that I can discover God's purposes.

On referring to my diary I <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> saved his life two years ago by plunging into the Serpentine. This is very gratifying. Was late at the office as I had to look in at the Palace on the way, {{in order to get}} knighted, but managed to get a good deal of work done before I was interrupted by a madman with a razor, who demanded £100.

2500|$|I <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am [...] "intermediate" [...] between God and nothingness, {{between the}} supreme entity and nonentity. Insofar as I am the {{creation}} of the supreme entity, there's nothing in me to account for my being deceived or led into error, but, inasmuch as I somehow participate in nothing or nonentity — that is, insofar as I am distinct from the supreme entity itself and lack many things — it's not surprising that I go wrong. I thus understand that, in itself, error is a lack, rather than a real thing dependent on God. Hence, I understand that I can err without God's having given me a special ability to do so. Rather, I fall into error because my God-given ability to judge the truth is not infinite. [...] (Descartes, Meditation IV: On Truth and Falsity).|$|E

2500|$|Anglican clergymen / naturalists {{had been}} slow to respond to Vestiges, not wanting to give its vile ideas of {{transmutation}} publicity, but it sold increasing numbers to polite society. In the July Edinburgh Review a lengthy and scathing attack by Adam Sedgwick, who had taught Darwin geology at university, predicted [...] "ruin and confusion in such a creed" [...] which if {{taken up by the}} populace would [...] "undermine the whole moral and social fabric" [...] bringing [...] "discord and deadly mischief in its train." [...] On 8 October Darwin wrote telling Lyell that the review was [...] "far from popular with non-scientific readers. I think some few passages savour of the dogmatism of the pulpit, rather than of the philosophy of the Professor chair". Nevertheless, it was [...] "a grand piece of argument against mutability of species; & I read it with fear & trembling, but was well pleased to <b>find,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had not overlooked any of the arguments, though I had put them to myself as feebly as milk & water." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{summer of}} the year 1783 was an amazing and portentous one, and full of horrible phaenomena; for besides the {{alarming}} meteors and tremendous thunder-storms that affrighted and distressed the different counties of this kingdom, the peculiar haze, or smokey fog, that prevailed for many weeks in this island, and {{in every part of}} Europe, and even beyond its limits, was a most extraordinary appearance, unlike anything known within the memory of man. By my journal I <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had noticed this strange occurrence from June 23 to July 20 inclusive, during which period the wind varied to every quarter without making any alteration in the air. The sun, at noon, looked as blank as a clouded moon, and shed a rust-coloured ferruginous light on the ground, and floors of rooms; but was particularly lurid and blood-coloured at rising and setting. All the time the heat was so intense that butchers' meat could hardly be eaten on the day after it was killed; and the flies swarmed so in the lanes and hedges that they rendered the horses half frantic, and riding irksome. The country people began to look, with a superstitious awe, at the red, louring aspect of the sun; ...|$|E
