The addition of ethanol and solution heating was intended to overcome the problem of reproducibility and sensitivity ussually found in the determination of ammonia by <b>indophenol</b> <b>blue</b> method which is carried out in 100 % aqueous media. The determination of ammonia was done indirectly by reacting ammonia in the sample with hypochloride and phenol using nitroprussida as catalyst to yield blue color-intense chromophore of indophenol. The chromophore was then detected by UV-Visible spectrophotometer. The proposed method was applied for the determination of ammonia in various samples of river water located in Yogyakarta and Makassar.             Results of the study showed that ethanol addition into analytical solution and solution heating enhanced the formation of <b>indophenol</b> <b>blue.</b> The optimal heating was achieved after 90 minutes of mixing. In ethanol/water medium (50 / 50, v/v), <b>indophenol</b> <b>blue</b> exhibited maximum absorbance at 648 nm. The analytical performance of ammonia determination by <b>indophenol</b> <b>blue</b> method in this medium is as followed: detection limit = 0. 03 ppm, relative standard deviation (RSD) = 2. 50 % and the calibration curve was linear in the concentration range of 0. 0 - 0. 4 ppm with correlation coefficient (r) = 0. 9968.

The material consists of a periodic array of highly charged colloidal particles (110 nm diameter) embedded in a poly(hydroxyethyl acrylate) hydrogel.

In the Berthelot reaction, ammonia, hypochlorite, and phenol react to produce the dye molecule <b>indophenol</b> <b>blue</b> in an aqueous solution. We use this reaction in our sensor by covalently attaching 3 -aminophenol to the hydrogel backbone, which forms cross-links through the Berthelot mechanism.

The benzoquinone chlorimine reacts with another pendant aminophenol to form a cross-link. The creation of new cross-links causes the hydrogel to shrink, which reduces the lattice spacing of the embedded colloidal array.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} was to adopt a reverse flow {{injection}} analysis (rFIA) technique to the fluorometric analysis of the reaction o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) with ammonium, allowing accurate measurements of ammonium concentrations lower than the detection limit of the widely used <b>indophenol</b> <b>blue</b> (IPB) colorimetric method while accounting for the background fluorescence of seawater. Ammonium is considered an essential nutrient for primary productivity, especially in the nutrient depleted surface ocean where as the most reduced form of dissolved inorganic nitrogen, it is readily assimilated via metabolic pathways. Challenges in the quantification of ammonium require more sensitive analytical techniques for {{a greater understanding of}} the biogeochemical cycling of ammonium in the oligotrophic ocean. On-line and automated flow analysis techniques are capable of mitigating some of the challenges. Fluorescent-based methods out-perform colorimetric methods in terms of detection limits and sensitivity. Presented here is the development of an rFIA technique paired with an OPA-sulfite chemistry. For this method, a sulfite-formaldehyde reagent is mixed with the sample stream and then injected with the OPA reagent before being heated. Fluorescence is measured before and {{at the peak of the}} OPA injection, differentiating the background fluorescence from the analyte signal. Experiments to optimize reaction parameters and characterize the effects of salinity and potentially interfering species were conducted. The newly developed method offers a reasonable throughput (18 samples per hour), low limit of detection (1. 1 nM) ammonium analysis technique with automatic background fluorescence correction suitable for oligotrophic seawater as a preferable alternative to the low sensitivity and high limit of detection IPB colorimetric method...|$|E

The nitrite degradation capacity of Lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus LCR 6013 was investigated in pickle fermentation. After LCR 6013 fermentation for 120 h at 37 °C, the nitrite concentration in the fermentation system was significantly lower than that in the control sample without the LCR 6013 strain. The effects of NaCl and Vc on nitrite degradation by LCR 6013 in the De Man, Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS) medium were also investigated. The highest nitrite degradations, 9. 29 mg/L and 9. 89 mg/L, were observed when NaCl and Vc concentrations were 0. 75 % and 0. 02 %, respectively in the MRS medium, which {{was significantly higher than}} the control group (p ≤ 0. 01). Electron capture/gas chromatography and <b>indophenol</b> <b>blue</b> staining were used to study the nitrite degradation pathway of LCR 6013. The nitrite degradation products contained N 2 O, but no NH 4 (+). The LCR 6013 strain completely degraded all NaNO 2 (50. 00 mg/L) after 16 h of fermentation. The enzyme activity of NiR in the periplasmic space was 2. 5 times of that in the cytoplasm. Our results demonstrated that L. casei subsp. rhamnosus LCR 6013 can effectively degrade nitrites in both the pickle fermentation system and in MRS medium by NiR. Nitrites are degraded by the LCR 6013 strain, likely via the nitrate respiration pathway (NO 2 (-) >NO->N 2 O->N 2), rather than the aammonium formation pathway (dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium, DNRA), because the degradation products contain N 2 O, but not NH 4 (+) ...|$|E

Determination {{was based on}} fluorescence detection of a typical product of o-phthaldialdehyde and ammonium. In this study, the fluorescence reaction product could be efficiently extracted onto an SPE cartridge (HLB, hydrophilic-lipophilic balance). The extracted fluorescence compounds were rapidly eluted with ethanol and directed into a flow cell for fluorescence detection. Compared with the common used fluorescence method, the proposed one offered the benefits of improved sensitivity, reduced reagent consumption, negligible salinity effect and lower cost. Experimental parameters were optimized using a univariate experimental design. Calibration curves, ranging from 1. 67 to 300 nM, were obtained with different reaction times. The recoveries were between 89. 5 and 96. 5 %, and the detection limits in land-based and shipboard laboratories were 0. 7 and 1. 2 nM, respectively. The relative standard deviation was 3. 5 % (n = 5) for an aged seawater sample spiked with 20 nM ammonium. Compared with the analytical results obtained using the <b>indophenol</b> <b>blue</b> method coupled to a long-path liquid waveguide capillary cell, the proposed method showed good agreement.

30|$|Dry {{combustion}} method {{was used to}} determine total carbon in the composted manure (Nelson and Sommers 1982). Total organic matter was determined by multiplying the total carbon values by 1.72 (Nelson and Sommers 1982). Total content of nitrogen (N) was determined by Kjeldahl method. Soil, milled composted manure and spinach shoot samples were digested in a mixture (1 : 3) of perchloric (HClO 4) and nitric (HNO 3) acids to determine the total elemental composition of phosphorous (P), potassium (K), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd) in the extracts (Miller 1998). Spectrophotometer (Stalwart UV 900 USA) determined the P contents in all samples (soil, manure and plant) through phosphomolybdate blue method. Absorbance was determined at a wavelength of 710  nm (Olsen and Sommers 1982). Cationic elements in the soil, manure and plant samples were determined using atomic absorption spectrometer (AAS) (Model AAnalyst 700, Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The pH and electrical conductivity (EC) of soil and organic manures samples were measured in water-manure and water-soil suspensions of 1 : 5 ratio with pH (Janway 3505) and EC (Janway 470) meters. Nitrate-N and NH 4 -N were extracted from soil and manure by shaking 2  g of sample in 2  M KCl solutions for 1  h in 25  mL polypropylene centrifuge tubes on an end-over-end shaker, then centrifuged at 10, 000  rpm for 10  min and supernatant was analyzed.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of microfluidization and ultrasonication processing techniques used in the industrial mercantile on the ascorbic acid concentration of orange juice. The research question was: “Is there a significant mean difference between the ascorbic acid concentrations in the fresh, microfluidized and ultrasonicated orange juices?” It is hypothesized that there should be a significant mean difference between the ascorbic acid concentration in the fresh, microfluidized and ultrasonicated orange juices since the microfluidization and ultrasonication dilute and shear the orange juice by removing and breaking down its particles which may reduce the ascorbic acid content. A common titration technique was used to calculate the ascorbic acid concentration in the orange juices. With the help of the reagents <b>indophenol</b> (<b>blue</b> colored indicator), metaphosphoric acid and ascorbic acid, standard values of ascorbic acid was collected to use in the formula which is used to determine the ascorbic acid concentration in the orange juice. By the use of indophenol in the titration, the color of the orange juice solution will turn into pink as the indophenol nullifies the ascorbic acid content in the orange juice solution. The volume of indophenol solution will be recorded in order to use in the formula which is to find the amount of ascorbic acid in the orange juice. Moreover, the blank trial and standardization data are recorded to be used in the same formula. The Anova results, P-value and graphical investigation accept the alternate hypothesis which suggests there should be a difference between average ascorbic acid concentrations of processed and unprocessed juices. The average concentration of ascorbic acid in the fresh orange juice was 4. 82 g/lt, the concentration of ascorbic acid in the microfluidized orange juice was 4. 10 g/lt and the concentration of ascorbic acid in the ultrasonicated orange juice was 3. 00 g/lt.

40|$|Biogenic amines (BAs) are organic amines {{present in}} meat, fish, dairy produce and wine {{due to the}} {{breakdown}} of amino acids, catalysed by microbial decarboxylases. BAs determination in food is important {{not only because of}} possible toxicological effects such as nausea, sweating and headache but also due to their possible role as indicators of food spoilage. Chromatographic methods are traditionally applied for determination of BAs in food [1], which usually require preliminary operations for sample pre-treatment that are laborious and difficult to automate. On the other hand, screening analytical systems provide simple, low cost and rapid analysis with the possibility of subjecting high number of samples to the screening system in a short time [2]. In this work we present a novel method for screening determination of BAs using a microfluidic system with the detection by highly sensitive thermal lens microscope (μFIA-TLM). Four biogenic amines (putrescine, cadaverine, histamine and tyramine) were subjected to enzymatic catalysis by transglutaminase, where ammonia was released as a product of acyl transfer reaction between the peptide bound glutamine (Gln) and the amino group of BAs. Ammonia was further transformed into <b>indophenol</b> <b>blue</b> by the Berthelot reaction. The coloured product was detected in batch (static) mode in a 100 μm sample cell or in μFIA (flowing) mode in a microchip with the same optical path length.

For evaluation of the sensitivity and determination of LOD values (S/N = 3 basis), the NH 4 Cl standard solution was applied in Berthelot reaction with further detection on TLM system. The LODs for NH 4 + in batch mode and in μFIA were 24 μg/L and 109 μg/L, respectively. Both LOD values are lower than the LOD achieved with conventional spectrophotometry (180 μg/L).

40|$|Le {{processus}} de nitrification joue un rôle essentiel dans le cycle de l'azote dans les milieux aquatiques naturels. La mesure de l'activité nitrifiante est une étape obligée pour bien comprendre et quantifier les flux d'azote dans ces milieux. Ce travail présente une réévaluation de la méthode de mesure de l'activité nitrifiante autotrophe par la méthode d'incorporation de bicarbonate marqué au 14 C et son application pour estimer des biomasses de bactéries nitrifiantes. La validité générale de la méthode a été démontrée par des tests menés sur des inhibiteurs de nitrification qui ont montré que l'utilisation combinée de N-serve (5 ppm) et de chlorate (10 mM) inhibait de manière complète et spécifique l'oxydation d'azote et l'incorporation de carbone des deux groupes de bactéries nitrifiantes. Un facteur de rendement (carbone incorporé par azote oxydé) de 0, 1 mole C/mole N a également été déterminé sur des cultures pures de bactéries nitrosantes et nitratantes. Pour l'activité potentielle, en particulier, les conditions optimales pour la mesure d'activité nitrifiante ont également été établis: un pH entre 7 et 8, une température entre 20 et 30 °C, une concentration en ammonium d'au moins 1 mmol/l et en oxygène d'au moins 6 mg/l. Une relation entre les mesures d'activité nitrifiante potentielle et la biomasse des bactéries nitrifiantes a été établie sur culture pure. Elle {{montre que}} dans les conditions de mesures de l'activité potentielle, 1 µg C de bactéries nitrifiantes oxyde 0, 04 µmol N/hBy regenerating oxidised forms of nitrogen (nitrate), the nitrification process {{plays an important}} role in the nitrogen cycle of aquatic environments. The measurement of the activity and biomass of nitrifying bacteria is thus essential to understand and quantify the general nitrogen fluxes in those environments. Different methods of measuring the nitrifying activity exist. The first methods developed were based on the use of specific nitrification inhibitors: N-serve, allyl thio-urea, acetylene, methylfluoride and dimethyl ether, as most used. They consist in measuring differences of ammonium, nitrite and nitrate dynamics in an inhibited and control sample during time. These methods can be applied as long as the inhibitors are specific for nitrifying bacteria, and activities are high enough to allow the measurement of concentration variations during incubation times which are not too long. At the present time, the most used methods are dealing with isotopic tracers: 14 C or 15 N. 15 N methods allow the direct measurement of the nitrifying activity, while 14 C methods represent the measurement of a biomass production which can be converted into a substrate oxidation rate by the use of a yield factor. This factor is considered to be constant in the standard incubation conditions. The most frequently used enumeration methods of nitrifying bacteria are not very satisfactory. Classical culture techniques (most probable number) and immunofluorescence techniques are known to greatly underestimate the numbers of active organisms. Recently developed gene-probes techniques work well for the identification of particular strains, but are not yet useful for the numeration. A good alternative to these methods consists in the measurement of potential nitrifying activity which is correlated to the nitrifying biomass. This work presents a reassessment of the autotrophic nitrifying activity measurement by the 14 C-bicarbonate incorporation method and its use to estimate the biomass of nitrifying bacteria. Several methods were used for our study: Continuous enrichment cultures of nitrifying bacteria were obtained from an inoculum coming from the Seine estuary (freshwater section). Pure cultures of Nitrosomonas europaea and Nitrobacter winogradskyi were obtained from the National Collection of Industrial and Marine Bacteria (Aberdeen, Scotland) and a continuous enrichment culture of mixed heterotrophic bacteria, without nitrifying organisms, was obtained with a freshwater inoculum by imposing a residence time of 2 hours (less than the generation time of nitrifying bacteria). Nitrifying cell numbers and size in the pure cultures were determined by epifluorescence with a microscope, after DAPI staining. Biovolumes were estimated according to cell size and converted in biomasses according to a conversion factor determined experimentally with a carbon analyser. Ammonium was measured with the <b>indophenol</b> <b>blue</b> method, nitrate was reduced in nitrite on a cadmium bed and nitrite was measured with the sulfanilamide method. Bicarbonate was measured by acid titration in natural water samples, and with the evolution method for culture samples. C incorporation rates are measured by the incubation of samples with 14 C-bicarbonate, the samples being filtered on 0. 2 µm membranes, acidified and counted for radioactivity by liquid scintillation. The general validity of the method was demonstrated by experiments on nitrification inhibitors in enrichment cultures. These experiments consisted in measuring the effect of different combinations of N-serve, ethanol (the organic solvent of N-serve) and chlorate, on N-oxidation rates and C incorporation rates on samples of the two nitrifying enrichment cultures (ammonium- and nitrite-oxidising bacteria). The inhibitors effects were also determined on the C incorporation rates of heterotrophic bacteria. The results showed that the use of a combination of N-serve (5 mg/l, final concentration) and chlorate (10 mmol/l, final concentration) gave the best inhibition of ammonium- and nitrite-oxidation. However, the ethanolic solution of N-serve had an unwanted result on C incorporation. The organic solvent enhanced heterotrophic incorporation of C which totally masked out the autotrophic contribution of nitrifying bacteria. For this reason N-serve was added in the empty flask before the sample to allow the evaporation of the solvent. By acting this way, inhibition of autotrophic C incorporation by nitrifying bacteria was also complete, while heterotrophic incorporation was unaffected. To measure potential nitrifying activities, the optimal growth conditions of nitrifying bacteria were determined on enrichment cultures: a pH between 7 and 8, a temperature between 20 and 30 °C, an ammonium concentration over 1 mmol/l, and an oxygen concentration over 6 mg/l. An experience consisting in following N oxidation, C incorporation and cell growth in a pure culture of Nitrosomonas europaea and Nitrobacter winogradskyi in optimal conditions allowed us to determine a yield factor (incorporated C/oxidised N) of 0. 09 and 0. 02 molC/molN for the ammonia- and nitrite-oxidising bacteria respectively. The determined optimal growth rate was 0. 05 h- 1 for the two nitrifying species. The specific activity of nitrifying bacteria, which correspond to the maximum N-oxidation rate of 1 µg C of nitrifying bacteria, is given by the ratio between the growth yield and the growth rate of those organisms. This factors allowed us to establish a relationship between potential nitrifying activity measurements and nitrifying biomass: in optimal growth conditions, 1 µgC of ammonium-oxidising bacteria oxidised 0. 05 µmolN/h and 1 µgC of nitrite-oxidising bacteria oxidised 0. 21 µmolN/h. Our conclusion is that the results presented in this paper allow the validation of the 14 C-bicarbonate incorporation method with and without inhibitors to measure the nitrifying activity. The main differences of our protocol to the original ones is that we propose the use of a combination of 2 inhibitors, N-serve and chlorate, and the elimination by evaporation of the organic solvent of N-serve (ethanol) to avoid any interference with the heterotrophic populations. The method can be used in in situ conditions, to allow real nitrifying activities measurements in samples. In this case, carbon incorporation rates can be converted in ammonium oxidation rates with the use of the conversion factor 0. 11 µmoles incorporated C by µmoles oxidised N (0. 09 molC/molN for ammonium oxidation and 0. 02 for nitrite-oxidation). The method can also be used by placing the sample in optimal temperature, pH, oxygen and ammonium conditions for nitrifying bacteria, to allow potential nitrifying activity measurements. This potential activity can be used to estimate the nitrifying biomass by considering a conversion factor of 0. 04 µmolN/h/µgC (0. 05 µmolN/h/µgC for ammonium-oxidation and 0. 21 µmolN/h/µgC for nitrite-oxidation). The rapidity of the method, itís sensitivity and the fact that no special equipment is needed, except the one for 14 C detection, makes it a very useful method in aquatic ecology...|$|E
