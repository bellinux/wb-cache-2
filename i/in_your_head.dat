25|$|The private {{language}} {{argument is}} of central importance to {{debates about the}} nature of language. One compelling theory about language is that language maps words to ideas, concepts or representations in each person's mind. On this account, the concepts in my head are distinct from the concepts <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>head.</b> But I can match my concepts to a word in our common language, and then speak the word. You then match the word to a concept in your mind. So our concepts in effect form a private language which we translate into our common language and so share. This account is found for example in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, and more recently in Jerry Fodor's language of thought theory.|$|E

Lucy Davies for the BBC reviewed the song, writing [...] "Many of her reggae-fused songs stick <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> whilst you desperately suss out why they're familiar, but she rips off her influences with a comic acknowledgement, like 'Shame for You', which blatantly lifts the chorus hook from 'You Don't Love Me (No No No)' by Dawn Penn".|$|E

She further tells her lover that she left her head and her heart on the dance floor. [...] The verses are sung in a rapid-fire way, accompanied by double beats.

Because merger means change. And change means fear. And the worst kind of fear is the kind that lives <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>head.</b> The dark thoughts. The paranoia. The worst case scenarios that you play out that usually don't come true. And with Richard holing himself up inside his office, it's just a breeding ground for rumor, fear and paranoia. So, when we started talking about this episode, the theme of paranoia emerged pretty quickly."

Spin Josh Modell named it a highlight of the album; he wrote that if the album as a whole sounded like [...] "The Wave", [...] "it could fill arenas". Chris Martins of The A.V. Club wrote, [...] "Though Wyatt's vocals recall a sad-faced Peter Gabriel, the song is steeped {{in the kind of}} effervescent magic that makes Lykke Li and Peter Bjorn and John stars in their own right." [...] Evan Sawdey of PopMatters was critical of Wyatt's vocal performance; he wrote that [...] "we really {{get a sense of how}} Wyatt's voice hinders the group".

500|$|Lior Philips from Consequence of Sound found {{influences}} of Gaga's [...] "dance musicality" [...] in [...] "The Cure", {{especially in the}} [...] "finger clicking, pristine clean production, anthemic flute-like synth, and her remarkable falsetto".

On July 31 in an allowance race at Saratoga, Feliciano was replaced by Ron Turcotte, the regular jockey for Meadow Stables.

However, after finishing the song, he took preference to another song, [...] "Forever", which later became the lead single from his re-released album, titled Exclusive: The Forever Edition (2008). He felt that [...] "Disturbia" [...] would be better suited for a female singer and instead forwarded the song to Rihanna. When writing the song, he was inspired [...] "to go totally left and kind of weird". Speaking to USA Today, Brown described his feelings with regard to him giving the song to Rihanna: [...] "It's fun being creative and even if you have a concept <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> to write about, you can write it and give it and give it to someone else because it might not personally fit you, but it might be an idea you have." ...|$|E
500|$|Ryan Brockington from New York Post lauded the song, writing [...] "it’s a very surprising, and {{somewhat}} brilliant, apology track where Taylor sings about wishing {{to fix a}} relationship she wished she wouldn't have ruined in the first place." [...] His point was echoed by Rudy Klapper from Sputnikmusic, who described the song as a [...] "regret-filled apology". Stephen M. Deusner from Engine 145 gave the song a thumbs-up and praised Swift as [...] "an expressive singer", calling the song [...] "a dark fantasy of apology and reconciliation" [...] which is [...] "a true heartbreaker".

Trust me, [...] will be stuck <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> after the first listen." [...] In another review he felt that the song managed {{to bridge the gap between}} gospel and popular music. Describing the song as [...] "kinetic", Marc Hogan of Spin magazine called it [...] "not only star-studded, but damn near impossible to get out of your head, too".
