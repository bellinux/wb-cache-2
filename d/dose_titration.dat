25|$|Flumazenil is very {{effective}} at reversing the CNS depression associated with benzodiazepines but is less effective at reversing respiratory depression. One {{study found that}} only 10% of the patient population presenting with a benzodiazepine overdose are suitable candidates for flumazenil. In this select population who are naive to and overdose solely on a benzodiazepine, it can be considered. Due to its short half life, the duration of action of flumazenil is usually less than 1 hour, and multiple doses may be needed. When flumazenil is indicated the risks can be reduced or avoided by slow <b>dose</b> <b>titration</b> of flumazenil.

25|$|Myocarditis is a {{sometimes}} fatal {{side effect of}} clozapine, which usually develops within {{the first month of}} commencement. First manifestations of illness are fever which may be accompanied by symptoms associated with upper respiratory tract, gastrointestinal or urinary tract infection. Typically C-reactive protein (CRP) increases with the onset of fever and rises in the cardiac enzyme, troponin, occur up to 5 days later. Monitoring guidelines advise checking CRP and troponin at baseline and weekly for the first 4 weeks after clozapine initiation and observing the patient for signs and symptoms of illness. Signs of heart failure are less common and may develop with the rise in troponin. A recent case-control study found that the risk of clozapine-induced myocarditis is increased with increasing rate of clozapine <b>dose</b> <b>titration,</b> increasing age and concomitant sodium valproate.|$|E
25|$|Opioid effects (adverse or otherwise) can be {{reversed}} with an opioid antagonist such as naloxone or naltrexone. These competitive antagonists bind to the opioid receptors with higher affinity than agonists {{but do not}} activate the receptors. This displaces the agonist, attenuating or reversing the agonist effects. However, the elimination half-life of naloxone can be shorter {{than that of the}} opioid itself, so repeat dosing or continuous infusion may be required, or a longer acting antagonist such as nalmefene may be used. In patients taking opioids regularly it is essential that the opioid is only partially reversed to avoid a severe and distressing reaction of waking in excruciating pain. This is achieved by not giving a full dose but giving this in small doses until the respiratory rate has improved. An infusion is then started to keep the reversal at that level, while maintaining pain relief. Opioid antagonists remain the standard treatment for respiratory depression following opioid overdose, with naloxone being by far the most commonly used, although the longer acting antagonist nalmefene may be used for treating overdoses of long-acting opioids such as methadone, and diprenorphine is used for reversing the effects of extremely potent opioids used in veterinary medicine such as etorphine and carfentanil. However, since opioid antagonists also block the beneficial effects of opioid analgesics, they are generally useful only for treating overdose, with use of opioid antagonists alongside opioid analgesics to reduce side effects, requiring careful <b>dose</b> <b>titration</b> and often being poorly effective at doses low enough to allow analgesia to be maintained.|$|E

40|$|Objective: This study {{systematically}} reviews current {{evidence on}} drug treatments {{commonly used in}} postherpetic neuralgia. Methods: Randomized controlled trials were critically selected using predefined search criteria. Efficacy was evaluated as percentage of improvement in pain intensity between baseline and endpoint, tolerability by number of study discontinuations because of adverse events and incidence of adverse events. Results: Currently published trials enrolled different patient populations and small patient numbers. The great variability in <b>doses,</b> <b>titration</b> schemes, designs and washout periods together with other design flaws made comparison between different studies scientifically impossible. Conclusions: There is a real need for well-performed clinical trials with standardization in design and reporting. Development of adequate and validated questionnaires for evaluation and comparison of efficacy and safety of treatments is also needed. Based on the evaluation of individual studies, it is concluded that only gabapentin is studied in large (over 200 patients), placebo-controlled studies showing good efficacy and safety.

2500|$|The {{electrodes}} {{deliver an}} electrical stimulus.

30|$|As {{evidenced}} {{in a recent}} review by Schein et al. on PCA medication errors, at least 4.5 % of patients in the US each year are affected by IV PCA errors linked to medical prescriptions, drug choice/combinations, <b>dose</b> <b>titrations,</b> pump programming, and modifiable operator/patient dosing of analgesic opioid (Schein et al., 2009; Hicks et al., 2008). In our patient population the use of Zalviso® contributed to reduce such risks altogether, by eliminating possible sources of operator or patient manipulation —thanks to the single-dosed nanotablets and pre-programmed lockout interval set by the manufacturer which did not require any further operator-dosing interventions. Moreover, the device’s programmed lockout period system also eliminates the risk of opioid overdose by preventing patients from accessing tablets too close in time from one another, while the sublingual formulation maximized absorption and reduced the risk for analgesic gaps. One last advantage of Zalviso® with sublingual tablets is that it avoided {{the need for the}} physical connection to a PCA pump or IV pole, which generally reduce mobility and involve the classic risks of infection, analgesic gaps due to IV catheter infiltration or IV tubing obstruction (Panchal et al., 2007; Palmer & Miller, 2010).|$|R

40|$|Coumarins are the {{mainstay}} of oral anticoagulation for the treatment and prophylaxis of thromboembolic disorders. They have a narrow therapeutic index and regular monitoring is therefore required to avoid serious adverse effects. There is wide interindividual variability in dosage requirements, which makes anticoagulation response unpredictable. Current <b>dosing</b> <b>titrations</b> are haphazard and inconvenient and poor initial control leads to morbidity, and occasional mortality, because of bleeding and further thromboembolism. Recent discoveries have helped to characterize the {{factors that contribute to}} the interindividual variability in responses to coumarins. Patient and environmental factors that affect anticoagulation response to coumarins include age, body size, dietary vitamin K status, concurrent disease and drug interactions. More recently, single nucleotide polymorphisms in the 2 C 9 isoform of cytochrome P 450 (CYP 2 C 9) and vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) have been shown to make significant contributions to the variability in coumarin dosage requirements. Polymorphisms in other genes that mediate the actions of coumarins may also contribute to this variability. Racial and cultural differences influence dosage requirements, which can be explained, at least in part, by genetic and dietary factors.

40|$|The {{recently}} known {{analgesic action}} mechanisms of nefopam (NFP) {{are similar to}} those of anticonvulsants and antidepressants in neuropathic pain treatment. It is difficult to prescribe high doses of oral neuropathic drugs without titration due to adverse effects. Unfortunately, there are few available intravenous analgesics for the immediate management of acute flare-ups of the chronic neuropathic pain. The aim of this study was to determine the additional analgesic effects for neuropathic pain of NFP and its adverse effects during the titration of oral medications for neuropathic pain among inpatients with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Methods: Eighty inpatients with PHN were randomly divided into either the NFP or normal saline (NS) groups. Each patient received a 3 -day intravenous continuous infusion of either NFP with a consecutive dose reduction of 60, 40, and 20 mg/d, or NS simultaneously while <b>dose</b> <b>titrations</b> of oral medications for neuropathic pain gradually increased every 3 days.

40|$|Background and objectives: The {{mortality}} {{risk associated with}} attempting to raise hemoglobin (Hb) levels by increasing Epoetin alfa (EPO) doses in hemodialysis patients with persistently low Hb remains poorly understood. Design, setting, participants, & measurements. We included hemodialysis patients from a large dialysis provider between July 2000 and June 2001 who had EPO dose and Hb data for 6 consecutive months, and a mean Hb 11 g/dl after the sub- 11 period by dose-change categories; and evaluate the association between EPO dose changes and {{mortality risk}}. Results: Patients {{were more likely to}} receive greater EPO dose increases if they had lower EPO doses, higher Hb levels, or were recently hospitalized. Greater EPO dose increases elevated the likelihood of achieving an Hb> 11 g/dl in the subsequent 3 mo. Larger EPO dose changes over the sub- 11 period were not associated with an elevated mortality risk, but having an Hb < 9 g/dl {{at the end of that}} period independent of dose change was associated with mortality risk. We found that patients receiving larger dose changes and whose resulting Hb level remained < 9. 5 g/dl at the end of the 3 mo were at elevated mortality risk.

40|$|Although {{depression}} is an eminently treatable condition, inadequate pharmacotherapy {{is far too}} common. Lack of uniform standards of care across different settings characterises psychiatric practice in a developing country like India.

The sample consisted mainly of young to middle aged patients, predominantly female, with moderately severe depressive episodes. Antidepressants were prescribed universally with TCAs (mainly Imipraminc), followed by Fluoxetine being the most common drugs used. Pharmacotherapy was often found to be deficient in several areas such as, starting doses, rate of increase in dose, maximum <b>doses</b> used, <b>dose</b> <b>titrations,</b> duration of treatment, change of drugs, recording of side effects and compliance etc. Results regarding norms for adequate doses and periods of treatment before switching drugs, {{for the kind of}} patients included in this study, were unclear, and need to be explored further.

40|$|Histones {{are small}} {{proteins}} {{critical to the}} efficient packaging of DNA in the nucleus. DNA–protein complexes, known as nucleosomes, are formed when the DNA winds itself around {{the surface of the}} histones. The methylation of histone residues by enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH 2) maintains gene repression over successive cell generations. Overexpression of EZH 2 can silence important tumor suppressor genes leading to increased invasiveness of many types of cancers. This makes the inhibition of EZH 2 an important target in the development of cancer therapeutics. We employed a three-stage computational de novo peptide design method to design inhibitory peptides of EZH 2. The method consists of a sequence selection stage and two validation stages for fold specificity and approximate binding affinity. The sequence selection stage consists of an integer linear optimization model that was solved to produce a rank-ordered list of amino acid sequences with increased stability in the bound peptide-EZH 2 structure. These sequences were validated through the calculation of the fold specificity and approximate binding affinity of the designed peptides.

40|$|Protease-activated {{receptor}} (PAR) signaling {{is closely}} linked to the cellular activation of the pro- and anticoagulant pathways. The endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) is crucial for signaling by activated protein C through PAR 1, but EPCR may have additional roles by interacting with the 4 -carboxyglutamic acid domains of procoagulant coagulation factors VII (FVII) and X (FX). Here we show that soluble EPCR regulates the interaction of FX with human or mouse tissue factor (TF) -FVIIa complexes. Mutagenesis of the FVIIa 4 -carboxyglutamic acid domain and <b>dose</b> <b>titrations</b> with FX showed that EPCR interacted primarily with FX to attenuate FX activation in lipid-free assay systems. In human cell models of TF signaling, antibody inhibition of EPCR selectively blocked PAR activation by the ternary TF-FVIIa-FXa complex but not by the non-coagulant TF-FVIIa binary complex. Heterologous expression of EPCR promoted PAR 1 and PAR 2 cleavage by FXa in the ternary complex but did not alter PAR 2 cleavage by TF-FVIIa. In murine smooth muscle cells that constitutively express EPCR and TF, thrombin and FVIIa/FX but not FVIIa alone induced PAR 1 -dependent signaling. Although thrombin signaling was unchanged, cells with genetically reduced levels of EPCR no longer showed a signaling response to the ternary complex. These results demonstrate that EPCR interacts with the ternary TF coagulation initiation complex to enable PAR signaling and suggest that EPCR {{may play a role in}} regulating the biology of TF-expressing extravascular and vessel wall cells that are exposed to limited concentrations of FVIIa and FX provided by ectopic synthesis or vascular leakage...|$|R

40|$|So {{have the}} {{regulatory}} authorities overstated {{the risks and}} underestimated the benefits of antidepressants {{in the treatment of}} depression in youth? Considering that existing data from clinical trials on suicidality appear contradictory and incomplete, more careful scrutiny of the risks and benefits is clearly needed. Better data and a cleaner, more systematic approach toward adverse event data reporting may be able to answer the question at hand. Risk benefit analyses in paediatric trials may be more complicated because of high placebo response rates which make it difficult to show statistically and clinically significant drug-placebo differences. For example, in two recent randomised controlled trials of sertraline in children and adolescents (aged 6 - 17) with DSM-IV defined major depressive disorder, undertaken {{at the request of the}} FDA, 69 % of those who were taking sertraline were classified as responders compared with 59 % of patients taking placebo. While these differences were statistically significant, the mean change in scores from baseline to endpoint on the primary outcome measure, the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised, between the groups was so small so as to be of minimal clinical significance. In addition to high placebo response rates, other problems include non-publication of negative findings, withholding of unfavourable data and under-reporting of adverse events.

This review {{provides an overview}} of the practical management of chronic pain with intrathecal (IT) therapy using an interprofessional approach (eg, physicians and other health care professionals), with a focus on the contributions of PAs, NPs, and RNs. Methods: Narrative review based on literature searches of the Medline database and treatment guidelines on the use of IT therapy in the management of patients with chronic pain. Results: The specific roles and responsibilities of PAs, NPs, and RNs in the management of patients receiving IT therapy vary by practice. In many pain treatment centers, PAs, NPs, and RNs are responsible for patient education, postimplant maintenance, and ongoing supportive care of patients receiving IT therapy. Topics that we address include patient selection, patient expectations and goal setting, medication selection, outcome assessment, and treatment adjustment. Currently, morphine and ziconotide (a nonopioid, selective N-type calcium channel blocker) are the only agents approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for IT analgesia. We provide relevant information on the <b>dosing,</b> <b>titration,</b> and adverse effect management of these medications for PAs, NPs, and RNs responsible for administering IT therapy.

Clearance of infection was assessed after 7 days of treatment, and eradication was assessed following 7 days of treatment and a 14 -day posttreatment observation interval. Monotherapy with amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and ciprofloxacin cleared and eradicated the organism from porcine stomachs; monotherapy with metronidazole cleared the infection and eradicated it from some piglets. Metronidazole-resistant microbes were recovered from treated piglets which cleared but did not eradicate the infection. Monotherapy with bismuth subsalicylate, erythromycin, nitrofurantoin, and tetracycline in the dosage range of 5. 0 to 7. 1 mg/kg QID was less than 100 % effective in clearance and eradication, in that these drugs cleared and/or eradicated the infection from some of the piglets but did not eradicate the infection from all of the piglets.

Approximately 1 million cases of herpes zoster occur annually in the US, and one in every three people develops herpes zoster during their lifetime. Postherpetic neuralgia is a neuropathic pain syndrome characterized by pain that persists for months to years after resolution of the herpes zoster rash. It stems from damage to peripheral and central neurons {{that may be a}} byproduct of the immune/inflammatory response accompanying varicella zoster virus reactivation. Patients with postherpetic neuralgia report decreased quality of life and interference with activities of daily living. Approaches to management of postherpetic neuralgia include preventing herpes zoster through vaccination and/or antiviral treatment, and administering specific medications to treat pain. Current guidelines recommend treatment of postherpetic neuralgia in a hierarchical manner, with calcium channel α 2 -δ ligands (gabapentin and pregabalin), tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, or desipramine), or topical lidocaine patches as first-line drugs. The safety and tolerability of pharmacologic therapies for pain are important issues to consider as postherpetic neuralgia affects primarily an older population. Patients should be educated on appropriate <b>dosing,</b> <b>titration</b> if applicable, the importance of adherence to treatment for optimal effectiveness, and possible side effects. Health-care professionals {{play a key role in}} helping to ameliorate the pain caused by postherpetic neuralgia through early recognition and diligent assessment of the problem; recommending evidence-based treatments; and monitoring treatment adherence, adverse events, responses, and expectations. Nurse practitioners are especially crucial in establishing communication with patients and encouraging the initiation of appropriate pain-relieving treatments.
