5000|$|The <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>grouper</b> (Hyporthodus quernus, {{formerly}} Epinephelus quernus) is {{a species}} of marine fish in the family Serranidae. A large inquisitive inhabitant endemic to the Hawaiian Archipelago (most common around Midway and Kure Atoll) and Johnston Island.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>grouper</b> prefers deep cool {{waters and}} has been sighted at 380 ft. It is {{carnivorous}} and feeds on fishes and large invertebrates, attaining a length and weight of at least 3 feet and 50 pounds. Hawaiian groupers are protogynious and reproduce externally (fertilization in open water/substratum egg scatterers). They do not guard their eggs once laid. A long-lived, commercially important species (member of the 'Deep Seven') and highly sensitive to over-harvesting, the species is currently listed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as near threatened (NT). The Hawaiian name for this grouper is hāpu‘u, juveniles known as hāpu‘upu‘u.|$|E
40|$|A {{case study}} of the {{reproductive}} biology of the endemic <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>grouper</b> or hapu’upu’u (Hyporthodus quernus) {{is presented as a}} model for comprehensive future studies of economically important epinephelid groupers. Specimens were collected throughout multiple years (1978 – 81, 1992 – 93, and 2005 – 08) from most reefs and banks of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. The absence of small males, presence of atretic oocytes and brown bodies in testes of mature males, and both developed ovarian and testicular tissues in the gonads of five transitional fish provided evidence of protogynous hermaphroditism. No small mature males were collected, indicating that <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>grouper</b> are monandrous (all males are sex-changed females). Complementary microscopic criteria also were used to assign reproductive stage and estimate median body sizes (L 50) at female sexual maturity and at adult sex change from female to male. The L 50 at maturation and at sex change was 580 ± 8 (95...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe peacock grouper (Cephalopholis argus) was {{intentionally}} {{introduced to}} the Hawaiian coastal waters 50 years ago to enhance the local fisheries. Following introduction, this species spread rapidly and became extremely abundant. A comparison of the metazoan parasite community of C. argus was performed between its native range (Moorea Island, French Polynesia) and its introduced range (Oahu and Big Island, Hawaii). Polynesian groupers were infected with a highly diversified parasite community whereas <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>groupers</b> exhibited a depauperate ensemble of parasite species, C. argus having lost most of the parasites common in their native range. Interestingly, the grouper has not acquired new parasites present in Hawaiian waters. This study provides the first field evidence of significant parasite release in a wild but previously introduced fish in coral reefs and is discussed {{in relation to the}} Enemy-Release Hypothesis which has never been assessed in those ecosystem...|$|R
40|$|The {{availability}} of variable genetic markers for groupers (Serranidae) {{has generally been}} limited to mitochondrial DNA. For studies of population genetic structure, more loci are usually required; particularly useful {{are those that are}} nuclear in origin such as microsatellites. Here, we isolated and characterized 9 microsatellite loci from the endemic <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>grouper</b> Epinephelus quernus using a biotin-labeled oligonucleotide-streptavidin-coated magnetic bead approach. Of the 20 repeat-containing fragments isolated, 15 had sufficient flanking region in which to design primers. Among these, 9 produced consistent polymerase chain reaction product, and 6 were highly variable. These 6 loci were all composed of dinucleotide repeats, with the number of alleles ranging from 6 to 18, and heterozygosities from 33. 3 % to 91. 7 %. The high levels of variability observed should make these markers useful for population genetic studies of E. quernus, and potentially other epinephelines...|$|E
40|$|Integration of {{ecological}} and genetic data to study patterns of biological connectivity can aid in ecosystem-based management. Here we investigated connectivity of the <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>grouper</b> Epinephelus quernus, {{a species of}} management concern within the Main Hawaiian Islands (MHI), by comparing genetic analyses with simulated larval dispersal patterns across the species range in the Hawaiian Archipelago and Johnston Atoll. Larval simulations revealed higher dispersal from the MHI to the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) than {{in the opposite direction}} and evidence for a dispersal corridor between Johnston and the middle of the Hawaiian Archipelago. Genetic analyses using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences and microsatellites revealed relatively high connectivity across the Hawaiian Archipelago, with the exception of genetically distinct populations and higher mtDNA diversity in the mid-Archipelago. These analyses support the preservation of the mid-archipelago as a source of genetic diversity and a region of connectivity with locations outside the Hawaiian Archipelago. Additionally, our evidence for directional dispersal away from the MHI lends caution to any management decisions that would rely on the NWHI replenishing depleted MHI stocks...|$|E
