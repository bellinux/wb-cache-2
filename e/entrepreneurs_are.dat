5|$|Hirschman {{also stated}} that during {{conditions}} of slack activity in developed countries, the stock of resources, machines and <b>entrepreneurs</b> <b>are</b> merely unemployed, and are present as idle capacity. So in this situation, simultaneous investment in {{a large number of}} sectors is a well-suited policy. The various economic agents are temporarily unemployed and once the inducement to invest starts operating, the slump will be overcome. However, for an underdeveloped economy, where such resources are absent, this principle doesn't fit.|$|E

25|$|Research on high-risk {{settings}} {{such as oil}} platforms, investment banking, medical surgery, aircraft piloting {{and nuclear}} power plants has related distrust to failure avoidance. When non-routine strategies are needed, distrusting persons perform better, while when routine strategies are needed trusting persons perform better. This research was extended to entrepreneurial firms by Gudmundsson and Lechner. They argued that in entrepreneurial firms the threat of failure is ever present resembling non-routine situations in high-risk settings. They found that the firms of distrusting entrepreneurs {{were more likely to}} survive than the firms of optimistic or overconfident entrepreneurs. The reasons were that distrusting entrepreneurs would emphasize failure avoidance through sensible task selection, and more analysis. Kets de Vries has pointed out that distrusting <b>entrepreneurs</b> <b>are</b> more alert about their external environment. He concluded that distrusting <b>entrepreneurs</b> <b>are</b> less likely to discount negative events, {{and are more likely to}} engage control mechanisms. Similarly, Gudmundsson and Lechner found that distrust leads to higher precaution and therefore increases chances of entrepreneurial firm survival.|$|E

30|$|An <b>entrepreneur</b> <b>is</b> an {{individual}} who establishes and manages a business enterprise. Dhenak (2010) defined an entrepreneur {{as a person who}} starts an enterprise. Chasserio et al. (2014) stated that an entrepreneur takes on different social roles and is constituted by several social identities. Torre (2015 a) defined entrepreneur in three ways; a starter, a driver, and being accountable and responsible. As a starter, an <b>entrepreneur</b> <b>is</b> an initiator, a challenger and a driver. An <b>entrepreneur</b> <b>is</b> someone that creates something new, an initiative, a business or a company. As a driver, an <b>entrepreneur</b> <b>is</b> the person in charge, the leader and the person to look to for leadership. In terms of being accountable and responsible, the <b>entrepreneur</b> <b>is</b> responsible for the destiny of the business venture, which can be a company, a project, or any other endeavour Torre (2015 b). The forces which drive {{an individual}} to become an <b>entrepreneur</b> may <b>be</b> the desire to acquire wealth, create job opportunities, and earn a living, among others, which can be regarded as an individual’s Entrepreneurial Outcome Expectation (EOE). An <b>entrepreneur</b> <b>is</b> a person who takes risks and bears responsibility for every action. The propensity to take risks by an <b>entrepreneur</b> <b>is</b> referred to in this study as Risk Taking Propensity Factor (RTPF). Risk Taking Propensity Factor (RTPF) is the willingness to take calculated risks associated with a business enterprise (Boyd & Vozikis, 1994). Therefore, an <b>entrepreneur</b> <b>is</b> {{an individual who}} has the desire to establish a business venture in order to be financially independent. The entrepreneurship intention of an individual motivates the individual in establishing an enterprise.|$|R
25|$|A feminist {{entrepreneur}} is {{an individual}} who applies feminist values and approaches through entrepreneurship, {{with the goal of}} improving the quality of life and wellbeing of girls and women. Many are doing so by creating ‘for women, by women’ enterprises.’ Feminist <b>entrepreneurs</b> <b>are</b> motivated to enter commercial markets by desire to create wealth and social change, based on the ethics of cooperation, equality, and mutual respect.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{show that}} the {{psychological}} propensities {{for male and female}} <b>entrepreneurs</b> <b>are</b> more similar than different. Empirical studies suggest that female entrepreneurs possess strong negotiating skills and consensus-forming abilities. Asa Hansson, who looked at empirical evidence from Sweden, found that the probability of becoming self-employed decreases with age for women, but increases with age for men. She also found that marriage increased the probability of a person becoming an entrepreneur.|$|E
25|$|Since 2000, the WEF {{has been}} {{promoting}} models developed {{by those in}} close collaboration with the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship, highlighting social entrepreneurship as a key element to advance societies and address social problems. Selected social <b>entrepreneurs</b> <b>are</b> {{invited to participate in}} the foundation's regional meetings and the annual meetings where they may meet chief executives and senior government officials. At the Annual Meeting 2003, for example, Jeroo Billimoria met with Roberto Blois, deputy secretary-general of the International Telecommunication Union, an encounter that produced a key partnership for her organization Child helpline international.|$|E

25|$|Project <b>entrepreneurs</b> <b>are</b> exposed {{repeatedly}} to problems and tasks {{typical of the}} entrepreneurial process. Indeed, project-entrepreneurs face two critical challenges that invariably characterize {{the creation of a}} new venture: locating the right opportunity to launch the project venture and assembling the most appropriate team to exploit that opportunity effectively. Resolving the first challenge requires project-entrepreneurs to access an extensive range of information needed to seize new investment opportunities. Resolving the second challenge requires assembling a collaborative team that has to fit well with the particular challenges of the project, and has to function almost immediately to reduce the risk that performance might be adversely affected.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, {{the third}} theater program aims to {{transform}} the business model. Basically, companies create new forms of business to address social or environmental challenges {{that will lead to}} financial returns in the long run. One example can be seen in Unilever's Project Shakti in India. The authors describe that the company hires women in villages and provides them with micro-finance loans to sell soaps, detergents, and other products door-to-door. This research indicates that more than 65,000 women <b>entrepreneurs</b> <b>are</b> doubling their incomes while increasing rural access and hygiene in Indian villages. Another example is IKEA's People and Planet initiative to be 100% sustainable by 2020. As a consequence, the company wants to introduce a new model to collect and recycle old furniture.|$|E
25|$|Select The Preferred Policy – The authors {{suggest that}} the overall best biofuel comes from the {{sugarcane}} in Brazil after comparing the economic & the environmental costs. The current cost of subsidising the price difference between European biofuels and fossil fuels per tonne of CO2 emissions saved is calculated to be €229–2000. If the production of European biofuels for transport is to be encouraged, exemption from excise duties is the instrument that incurs the least transactions costs, as no separate administrative or collection system needs to be established. A number of <b>entrepreneurs</b> <b>are</b> producing biofuels at the lower margin of the costs specified here profitably, once an excise duty rebate is given. It is likely that growth in {{the volume of the}} business will engender both economies of scale and innovation that will reduce costs substantially.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Entrepreneurs</b> <b>are</b> {{faced with}} {{liquidity}} constraints and often lack the necessary credit needed to borrow {{large amounts of}} money to finance their venture.

2500|$|<b>Entrepreneurs</b> <b>are</b> leaders {{willing to}} take risk and {{exercise}} initiative, taking advantage of market opportunities by planning, organizing, and deploying resources, often by innovating to create new or improving existing products or services. In the 2000s, the term [...] "entrepreneurship" [...] has been extended to include a specific mindset (see also entrepreneurial mindset) resulting in entrepreneurial initiatives, e.g. {{in the form of}} social entrepreneurship, political entrepreneurship, or knowledge entrepreneurship.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ability of}} {{entrepreneurs}} to innovate relates to innate traits, including extroversion and a proclivity for risk-taking. [...] According to Joseph Schumpeter, {{the capabilities of}} innovating, introducing new technologies, increasing efficiency and productivity, or generating new products or services, are characteristic qualities of entrepreneurs. One study has found that certain genes affecting personality may influence the income of self-employed people. Some people {{may be able to}} use [...] "an innate ability" [...] or quasi-statistical sense to gauge public opinion and market demand for new products or services. Entrepreneurs tend {{to have the ability to}} see unmet market needs and underserved markets. While some entrepreneurs assume they can sense and figure out what others are thinking, the mass media plays a crucial role in shaping views and demand. Ramoglou argues that <b>entrepreneurs</b> <b>are</b> not that distinctive and that it is essentially poor conceptualizations of [...] "non-entrepreneurs" [...] that maintain laudatory portraits of [...] "entrepreneurs" [...] as exceptional innovators or leaders [...] <b>Entrepreneurs</b> <b>are</b> often overconfident, exhibit illusion of control, when they are opening/expanding business or new products/services.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike public companies, {{information}} regarding an entrepreneur's business is typically confidential and proprietary.

[...] Entrepreneurs must remain vigilant about sharing information with venture capitalists that are investors in their competitors. [...] Most venture capitalists treat information confidentially, but as a matter of business practice, they do not typically enter into Non Disclosure Agreements because of the potential liability issues those agreements entail. [...] <b>Entrepreneurs</b> <b>are</b> typically well advised to protect truly proprietary intellectual property.|$|E
2500|$|Project <b>entrepreneurs</b> <b>are</b> {{individuals}} who are engaged in the repeated assembly or creation of temporary organizations. These are organizations that have limited lifespans which are devoted to producing a singular objective or goal and get disbanded rapidly when the project ends. Industries where project-based enterprises are widespread include: sound recording, film production, software development, television production, new media and construction. What makes project-entrepreneurs distinctive from a theoretical standpoint {{is that they have}} to [...] "rewire" [...] these temporary ventures and modify them to suit the needs of new project opportunities that emerge. A project entrepreneur who used a certain approach and team for one project may have to modify the business model and/or team for a subsequent project.|$|E
