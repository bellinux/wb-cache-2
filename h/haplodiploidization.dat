40|$|Study of {{the impact}} of growth {{substance}} treatment and maize (Zea mays L.) variety in spelt (Triticum spelta L.) <b>haplodiploidization.</b> So far as we know, this is the first study on spelt (Triticum spelta L.) <b>haplodiploidization.</b> The technique used involved an inter-generic cross with maize (Zea mays L.). The rate of embryos/ 100 pollinated florets was 16. 1. The spelt breeding line had no significant effect on embryo production, but the maize variety did, and an interaction between spelt breeding line and maize variety was found. The best rate was obtained with a maize variety of the popcorn type. The rate of caryopsis formation was low (66. 2 caryopses/ 100 pollinated florets). The rate of plantlet regeneration was very low (38 plantlets/ 100 embryos), with the maize variety having an impact, but not the spelt line...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of in vitro haploid plants followed by spontaneous or induced genome duplication allows to achieve, in one generation, {{the recovery of}} total homozygosis. The efficiency of the <b>haplodiploidization</b> process through in vitro anther culture of barley is variable among genotypes. This study was aimed at determining the androgenetic response of nine barley genotypes from the breeding program of Embrapa Trigo, analysing proembryoid development and green plantlets regeneration in anthers cultivated in vitro. Cultivar ‘BR 2 ’ presented the highest average of proembryoids (104 /anther) and ‘MN 698 ’ presented the highest average of green plantlets (0, 41 /anther). There was a significant variation among the average values of barley genotypes for embryo formation and green plantlets regeneration, making possible the selection to combine androgenetic capacity and good agronomic traits...|$|E
40|$|Oat (Avena spp.) {{is poorly}} {{responsive}} to the <b>haplodiploidization</b> process, {{which leads to the}} production of homozygous lines in one step, increasing breeding efficiency. Androgenetic haploids in small grain cereal crops are obtained from microspores cultured at the mononucleate stage, which can be identified by the size of anthers. In order to identify the appropriate anther size for in vitro culture, microspore cytological analyses were made in Avena sativa cultivars UPF 7, UPF 18, UFRGS 14, Stout and Avena sterilis CAV 3361, cultivated in growth chamber under controlled light and temperature conditions. Variation was observed within and among genotypes for anther size at each microspore developmental stage and according to the position of spikelets in the panicle. Architecture variation in panicle shape and non-linear microsporogenesis maturation increased the challenge of identifying potentially androgenetic oat anthers. Cytological screening before culture is critical in identifying microspores at the right stage for oat androgenesis...|$|E
40|$|A genetic {{analysis}} of adult plant resistance to leaf rust (Puccinia triticina) {{was performed in}} in vitro obtained double haploid progenies from a cross between the Brazilian wheat cultivar Trigo BR 35, which, under the high inoculum pressure of the southern region, has been resistant to leaf rust for more than 12 years, and the susceptible cultivar IAC 13 -Lorena. <b>Haplodiploidization</b> via in vitro gimnogenesis was done by somatic elimination of the pollen donor genome after maize pollination of the F 1 plants. The advantages and usefulness of double haploids (DH) for {{genetic analysis}} of complex inherited traits like durable adult-plant resistance to wheat leaf rust were evident: {{it was possible to}} analyze inheritance patterns in this cross by using only the 35 DH homozygous segregant lines obtained by in vitro embryo culture of F 1 flowers pollinated by maize, this number being equivalent to 1, 225 conventional F 2 lines because of lack of heterozygosity. After being infected with MCG and LPG races, the results indicated that Trigo BR 35 has two resistance genes. One of the genes expressed resistance only after the intermediate stage of plant development (5 - 6 leaves) ...|$|E
