40|$|Nye lokaler Oslo kommune åpnet sprøyterom i Tollbugata 3 i januar 2005. Etter en tids drift ble det tydelig at lokalene var lite egnet til formålet, og 1. juli 2007 flyttet sprøyterommet til en brakkerigg i Prindsenkvartalet i Storgata 36. Ny evaluering Den oppfølgende evalueringen er gjort på samme måte som den som ble levert i 2007 og gir en vurdering av om sprøyterommet, slik det fungerer i dag, innfrir formålene som ble satt i lov og forskrift. Oslo kommune ba også om en ”kost-nytte” vurdering av tilbudet. Forbedringer De ansattes situasjon er blitt langt bedre i nye lokaler, og brukerne gir også uttrykk for at de synes tilbudet har blitt bedre. Dette har ført til bedre trivsel for både ansatte og brukere. Det har vært en økning i helse- og sosialfaglig oppfølging av brukerne. Sårbehandling og samtaler er det som oftest går igjen. Dilemmaer Flere av dilemmaene som ble vurdert i den foregående evalueringen, er imidlertid fortsatt aktuelle. Ordningen omfatter fremdeles bare injisering av heroin, selv om røyking av stoffet er langt mindre helseskadelig. Omfanget av injisering i hals og lyske har økt, da dette medfører økt risiko for helseskade er det et dilemma hvorvidt sprøyterommet skal tillate slik injisering. Når det gjelder de ansattes meldeplikt til barnevern og sosialtjeneste, ser det nå ut til å være avklart at denne skal overholdes slik det fremkommer i helsepersonelloven. Tidligere ble det også opplevd som et dilemma at psykisk syke brukere ikke alltid kunne bruke sprøyterommet fordi de ikke greide å innordne seg reglene. Dette problemet er langt på vei løst med nye og større lokaler som bedre ivaretar de ansattes sikkerhet, samtidig som det gir brukerne mer armslag. ”Kost-nytte” Kost-nyttevurderingen av sprøyteromstilbudet blir i evalueringen vurdert ut fra om de oppsatte formålene med ordningen kan sies å være nådd, selv om disse ikke alltid er målbare. Det må kunne sies at tilbudet bidrar til økt verdighet for den aktuelle målgruppen, både på et individuelt og på et overordnet nivå. Sprøyterommet har også bidratt til økt mulighet for helse- og sosialfaglig oppfølging, og trolig også til bedre sprøytehygiene. he new {{premises}} are satisfactory. Staff {{security is}} well attended to. Operating costs have virtually doubled since the <b>injecting</b> <b>room</b> {{moved to a}} new home, however. Higher outlays must be seen in light of the depreciation of the new premises. Consistent with the findings of the former evaluation, frequency of use by registered clients varies widely. The ‘frequently’ percentage (on average 6 or more visits per month) rose slightly, but so did the ‘rarely’ category (0 − 2 visits per month on average). A detailed examination of the ten clients with the highest visiting frequency reveals, all the same, large fluctuations from month to month. The amount of heroin the users report to inject shows {{more or less the same}} distribution as at the former evaluation. Percentage of injections in the groin was slightly higher compared the first two years of operations. Again compared with that period, the move to new premises has not caused problems in the sense of the police «chasing» <b>injecting</b> <b>room</b> clients away or making it difficult to run the Oslo-injecting facility in any way. As was said in connection with the last evaluation, the supervised drug injection scheme can be said to have promoted the dignity of the group in question, both generally and for the individual. Although it is impossible to operationalise dignity as a concept in a measurable way, one can say that the <b>injecting</b> <b>room</b> communicates an acknowledgement of injecting drug users’ basic human value and need of help. For the clients, the services and contact with staff doubtless go some way to underpinning a sense of dignity. Working conditions at the new premises are better, increasing staff and client satisfaction, which again can be said to help clients feel more valued than was the case in the old facility. After the move to the new premises, somatic and psycho-social health matters were raised in 14 per cent of all visits, while the corresponding percentage during the first two operating years was 8 per cent. Treatment of wounds and consultations with staff are the most frequent forms of assistance. Although the rise can be put down to an improved registration procedure, there is reason to believe that increased focus and better staffing have played a not inconsiderable role. There was a rise in the number of visits during which the clients receive advice about injecting the drug, from 13 per cent in the first two years to 17 per cent in the new <b>injecting</b> <b>room.</b> At the same time, advice was given to a smaller percentage of clients, from 81 to 76 per cent. Following the move, 0. 68 per cent of injections have resulted in overdose incidents, compared with 0. 61 per cent during the first two years. There was, however, a fall in the percentage of clients suffering from an overdose, from 18 per cent in the first two years to 11 per cent after the move. Staff sick leave fell significantly and reports attest to a good working environment. Staff express great satisfaction with their immediate superior, but feel dogged by the senior management at the Alcohol and Drug Addiction Service. Training of new staff and support meetings appear to work in a satisfactory way. While staff are generally happy with the working environment, they would like more space, longer opening hours and more staff. Harm reduction programmes such as the <b>injecting</b> <b>room</b> will raise numerous dilemmas/problems for staff and decision makers. Having said that, opinions on what exactly constitutes a dilemma and how seriously it should be taken will vary. Some dilemmas/problems are largely similar to the challenges, choices and constraints in other services for drug users. Others are issues addressed under general drug and alcohol policy, but seen here through the lens of a public <b>injecting</b> <b>room</b> facility. Most of the dilemmas and choices discussed in the last evaluation report still apply; some, however, appear to have been eliminated...|$|E

40|$|NORSK SAMMENDRAG: Oslo kommune åpnet sprøyterom 1. februar 2005, etter at Stortinget i desember 2004 vedtok en midlertidig lov om en prøveordning med sprøyterom. Forskerne Astrid Skretting og Hilgunn Olsen ved SIRUS har på oppdrag av Helse- og omsorgsdepartementet evaluert prøveordningen. I de første to driftsårene var det 383 brukere av sprøyteromsordningen. Av disse brukte 2 / 3 tilbudet i gjennomsnitt to ganger eller mindre per måned, mens bare 10 prosent brukte tilbudet mer enn seks ganger per måned. Det ble i gjennomsnitt satt 24 injeksjoner per dag. - Et viktig formål med ordningen var å vurdere effekten av straffrihet for en brukerdose heroin. Politiet har støttet lojalt opp om ordningen, så dette må sies å ha fungert, sier Astrid Skretting. - En annen målsetting var å bidra til økt verdighet for tungt belastede heroinmisbrukere. I den grad det er mulig å måle dette, må en kunne si at sprøyteromsordningen har bidratt til økt verdighet både på et allment og et individuelt nivå. Den gir et signal om anerkjennelse av hjelpebehov til alle sprøytemisbrukere. For den enkelte bruker kan den konkrete hjelpen som gis og måten de blir møtt på, sies å bidra til økt verdighet. Målsettingen om helse- og sosialfaglig oppfølging er derimot i begrenset grad oppfylt. Vi har ikke grunnlag for å si om prøveordningen har bidratt til færre overdoser eller overdosedødsfall, sier Skretting. Brukerne gir uttrykk for stor tilfredshet med tilbudet. De oppgir trygghet for politi og vektere når de injiserer, og at de lærer å injisere slik at de får mindre skader, som grunner til at de oppsøker sprøyterommet. Evalueringen peker på en rekke dilemmaer det må tas stilling til ved en eventuell {{permanent}} sprøyteromsordning: Skal det bare være tillatt å injisere heroin eller bør det også gis adgang til å røyke heroin, som innebærer mindre risiko for skader og overdoser? Skal det ikke tillates å injisere andre narkotiske stoffer enn heroin, så lenge det er få rene heroinmisbrukere i Norge? Kan en sprøyteromsordning tolkes som et signal om at samfunnet aksepterer bruk av narkotika? Er sprøyterom en riktig bruk av samfunnets ressurser og hvor langt skal samfunnet strekke seg for å imøtekomme rusmiddelmisbrukeres behov for ulike tjenester? Oslo kommune og Sosial- og helsedirektoratet får i rapporten kritikk for at sprøyterommet ble åpnet uten nødvendige forberedelser. Mangelfull opplæring av personalgruppa og lokaler som ikke tilfredsstilte kravene i forskriften, førte til store belastninger for de ansatte. Evalueringen gir ingen anbefaling om prøveordningen bør gjøres permanent. Den påpeker imidlertid at en eventuell permanent sprøyteromsordning må stille krav til kommunene som ønsker å etablere et slikt tilbud. Lokalene må være hensiktsmessige og ivareta de ansattes sikkerhet. De ansattes opplæring og arbeidsforhold må også ivaretas på en bedre måte enn i prøveordningen. ENGLISH SUMMARY: A {{proposal to}} pilot a public <b>injecting</b> <b>room</b> was put before the Norwegian parliament (Stortinget) {{for the first}} time in 1999. The idea went back and forth between different governments and parliaments. The Director General of Public Prosecutions warned legislators that before a supervised <b>injecting</b> <b>room</b> could be established, the law would have to be amended. A provisional act sanctioning the pilot scheme was adopted by parliament (Drug Injection Rooms Act), 25 together with a set of regulations in December of 2004. SIRUS was asked to evaluate the scheme. Oslo City Council was authorized by the Directorate for Health and Social Affairs to pilot the supervised injecting centre. Oslo City Council opened the centre, located in the centre of Oslo, on February 1, 2005. A specific group of injectors was singled out as the centre target group, “heavy heroin users aged 18 and over”. The objectives of the scheme were: • to assess the effect of impunity for possession and use of drugs in a certain area defined elsewhere: • to help heavy drug users build a sense of self-esteem (dignity); • to facilitate contact between the social and health services and drug users; • to prevent the spread of infectious diseases; and • reduce overdose rates and overdose fatalities Two years later, 409 persons had registered as clients of the centre, of whom 383 used the facility on one or more occasions. Of these 383, 71 per cent were male and 29 per cent female; 23 per cent were 30 or younger, 41 per cent 31 – 40 and 37 per cent 40 or above. In these two years, 17, 226 injections were administered, that is, an average of 24 injections every day. There is wide variation in the frequency with which registered clients used the facility. Only 10 per cent used the centre more than six times per month. Two thirds used it only once or twice per month after registering as clients. Injection doses of 0. 2 – 0. 25 grams were reported by 80 per cent of the clients. The drug was predominantly injected into the arm (64 per cent), followed by groin (19 per cent), leg (15 per cent) and neck (2 per cent). Clients reported safety as their primary reason for using the facility. Other important reasons included the sense of security at the facility, learning how to inject more safely, supervision in the event of an overdose, and knowledge that they could administer the drug without worrying about the police or security guards moving them on. The clients of the injecting centre express in the main satisfaction with the facilities provided. Virtually none have any complaints about advice on how to inject, how they were treated by staff or about the equipment provided. They would like to see opening hours extended, and an opportunity to inject pills with the heroin. The police have given their full support during the trial. Impunity has undoubtedly worked insofar as it, in legal terms, is actually possible to run the injecting facility, despite the inability of staff to satisfy themselves that clients are only bringing one heroin dose onto the premises. Impunity has had an unintended side effect however, in that possession of small quantities of heroin is decriminalised even further in the centre of Oslo. Insofar as it is possible to operationalize the concept of dignity, it could be said that the <b>injecting</b> <b>room</b> has had a positive effect on the dignity of the group in question. The pilot scheme has enhanced the dignity of drug users in a wider sense, by acknowledging the need to inject drugs in as risk free an environment as possible. The courteous manner of the staff has also been beneficial in that sense as well. Healthcare and welfare counselling have been provided in 8 per cent of all visits. This care depends, however, on adequate staffing. Suitable premises where staff and clients can talk privately would improve the centre’s ability to provide care. Given the limited data it is difficult to say whether the scheme reduced infection or contamination rates. Clients are obliged to follow strict rules of hygiene, however. They are also given practical advice on the best way of administering an injection, with least risk of developing physical problems such as inflammation and abscesses. Injection training was given in 13 per cent of all injection visits, and to 81 per cent of the clients on one or more occasions. One would expect clients to practice what they learned when they inject outside the facility. Clients became more aware of the need for good standards of hygiene, they said. 0. 6 per cent of injections resulted in an overdose, and 18 per cent of clients experienced an overdose while at the <b>injecting</b> <b>room.</b> None of these incidents were fatal. There is no evidence that the scheme has caused a general reduction in overdose rates or overdose fatalities. To avoid risk of overdose, there would have to be sufficient capacity to supervise most of the injections administered in the city. Staff turnover has been high. After an initial period of enthusiasm, poor physical and psycho-social working conditions resulted in high levels of sick leave absence and resignations. Many members of staff felt at risk and that responsibility for preventing overdoses was too onerous. It was also exhausting having to observe at close quarters clients’ self-destructive behaviour. They felt let down by their employer, and have had limited access to professional advice and counselling. Oslo City Council and Alcohol and Drug Addiction Service started the scheme without the necessary preparations, according to the staff. Personnel training was inadequate. The Directorate for Health and Social Affairs is blamed for giving the City authorities the green light. The Directorate should have realized that the premises were below the standards required in the regulations, and that personnel lacked appropriate training. If the scheme becomes a permanent fixture, more suitable premises must be found. The <b>injecting</b> <b>room</b> must be large enough to allow a certain amount of space between staff and injecting clients. The facility must have two exits, and an effective ventilation system. Opening hours should cater to the needs of the clients. Care of staff must be given high priority. More should be done to ensure as safe an environment as possible for staff. This includes not only the architectural layout of the facility, but the psycho-social aspects of working conditions. Consideration should be given, if the facility becomes a permanent service, to locate it in a “health centre“ for drug users. Supervised injecting rooms come with their own set of paradoxes/dilemmas Several issues need to be addressed: • Since injecting heroin is more likely to result in an overdose than smoking it, it could be seen as a paradox that the Norwegian trial only allows the drug to be injected. • As long as the number of exclusive heroin users in Norway is so low, it could be a paradox that the only drug clients may inject is heroin. • It could also be a paradox that the injecting facility may in fact be contributing to the perpetuation of drug abuse. • An injecting facility will find it difficult to cope with clients suffering from mental illness and aggressive behaviour. It could therefore be a dilemma that the people most in need of a drug injecting facility may have to be kept out. • Administering an injection in the neck or groin is more likely to cause physical injury than in the arm. Whether a future injecting facility centre should allow clients to administer injections in the neck or groin is therefore something of a dilemma. • A desire to keep drug addicts off the streets could be an argument in favour of an injecting facility, but it might put the health aspect in the shade. • By running an injecting facility, the authorities may indirectly be seen as condoning drug use. • The Health Personnel Act requires staff in an public <b>injecting</b> <b>room</b> to notify the child welfare authorities when clients are caring for children, the social services if clients are pregnant, and the police if clients have been driving while impaired by drugs/alcohol. This may create a dilemma for staff, because by notifying the authorities they risk alienating the client. • As long as the public <b>injecting</b> <b>room</b> is a scarce “commodity”, there is no guarantee that users with the greatest need will be admitted. Whether the “first come, first served” principle should be applied, or other criteria, is yet another dilemma. • And is it wise to spend public resources on an injecting centre, and how far should society go in attending to the various types of assistance needed by drug users...|$|E

Riksad vokaten påpekte at etablering av offentlig sprøyterom måtte hjemles i lo v. Midlertidig lov og forskrift om prøveordning med lokaler for injeksj on av narkotika (sprøyteromsloven) ble vedtatt av Stortinget i desember 2004. SIRUS fikk i oppdrag å evaluere prøveordningen. Oslo kommune fikk godkjenning fra Sosial- og helsedirektoratet om å sette i gang prøveordning med sprøyterom. Oslo kommune åpnet sprøyterom i Tollbugata 3, 1. februar 2005. Målgruppa for sprøyteromsordningen er "tungt belastede heroin- misbrukere som er fylt 18 år". Formålet med prøveordningen er å: • vurdere effekten av straffrihet for besittelse og bruk av narkotika på et nærmere begrenset område, • bidra til økt verdighet for tungt belastede narkotikamisbrukere, • gi økt mulighet for kontakt og samtaler mellom rusmiddel- misbrukere og hjelpeapparat, • bidra til å forebygge infeksjoner og smitte og • redusere antall overdoser og overdosedødsfall. I de første to driftsårene var det registrert 409 personer som brukere, og av disse var det 383 som brukte sprøyteromsordningen en eller flere ganger. Av de 383 var 71 prosent menn og 29 prosent kvinner, 23 prosent var 30 år eller yngre, 41 prosent 31 - 40 år og 37 prosent var eldre enn 40 år. I de første to driftsårene ble det satt 17 226 injeksjoner, det vil si et gjennomsnitt på 24 injeksjoner per dag. Det er store variasjoner i hvor ofte de registrerte brukerne har brukt sp røyteromsordningen. Det er bare 10 prosent som har brukt sprøyteromsordningen mer enn seks ganger i gjennomsnitt per måned. 2 / 3 har i gj ennomsnitt brukt tilbudet to ganger eller mindre per måned i den ti den de har vært registret. 80 prosent av brukerne rapporterte å sku lle injisere 0, 2 – 0, 25 gram heroin (en "kvarting"). De fleste injeksjonene ble satt i arm (64 prosent). A {{proposal}} to pilot a public <b>injecting</b> <b>room</b> was put before the Norwegian parliament (Stortinget) {{for the first}} time in 1999. The idea went back and forth between different governments and parliaments. The Director General of Public Prosecutions warned legislators that before a supervised <b>injecting</b> <b>room</b> could be established, the law would have to be amended. A provisional act sanctioning the pilot scheme was adopted by parliament (Drug Injection Rooms Act), 25 together with a set of regulations in December of 2004. SIRUS was asked to evaluate the scheme. Oslo City Council was authorized by the Directorate for Health and Social Affairs to pilot the supervised injecting centre. Oslo City Council opened the centre, located in the centre of Oslo, on February 1, 2005. A specific group of injectors was singled out as the centre target group, “heavy heroin users aged 18 and over”. The objectives of the scheme were: • to assess the effect of impunity for possession and use of drugs in a certain area defined elsewhere: • to help heavy drug users build a sense of self-esteem (dignity); • to facilitate contact between the social and health services and drug users; • to prevent the spread of infectious diseases; and • reduce overdose rates and overdose fatalities Two years later, 409 persons had registered as clients of the centre, of whom 383 used the facility on one or more occasions. Of these 383, 71 per cent were male and 29 per cent female; 23 per cent were 30 or younger, 41 per cent 31 – 40 and 37 per cent 40 or above. In these two years, 17, 226 injections were administered, that is, an average of 24 injections every day. There is wide variation in the frequency with which registered clients used the facility. Only 10 per cent used the centre more than six times per month. Two thirds used it only once or twice per month after registering as clients. Injection doses of 0. 2 – 0. 25 grams were reported by 80 per cent of the clients. The drug was predominantly injected into the arm (64 per cent), followed by groin (19 per cent), leg (15 per cent) and neck (2 per cent). Clients reported safety as their primary reason for using the facility. Other important reasons included the sense of security at the facility, learning how to inject more safely, supervision in the event of an overdose, and knowledge that they could administer the drug without worrying about the police or security guards moving them on. The clients of the injecting centre express in the main satisfaction with the facilities provided. Virtually none have any complaints about advice on how to inject, how they were treated by staff or about the equipment provided. They would like to see opening hours extended, and an opportunity to inject pills with the heroin. The police have given their full support during the trial. Impunity has undoubtedly worked insofar as it, in legal terms, is actually possible to run the injecting facility, despite the inability of staff to satisfy themselves that clients are only bringing one heroin dose onto the premises. Impunity has had an unintended side effect however, in that possession of small quantities of heroin is decriminalised even further in the centre of Oslo. Insofar as it is possible to operationalize the concept of dignity, it could be said that the <b>injecting</b> <b>room</b> has had a positive effect on the dignity of the group in question. The pilot scheme has enhanced the dignity of drug users in a wider sense, by acknowledging the need to inject drugs in as risk free an environment as possible. The courteous manner of the staff has also been beneficial in that sense as well. Healthcare and welfare counselling have been provided in 8 per cent of all visits. This care depends, however, on adequate staffing. Suitable premises where staff and clients can talk privately would improve the centre’s ability to provide care...|$|E
50|$|European {{consumption}} rooms cater more so {{to users}} older than 30 years, mainly with problematic heroin and cocaine habits. Various studies have documented an ageing population of clients over time. Whereas in 1990, in one study, 50% of clients were 25 years or younger, by 2001 the percentage was 15%. Clients across European consumption rooms {{are characterized by}} heavy injecting drug use, a continuous use of illicit drugs and deriving from a poorer demographic. German studies found that between 19% and 27% of clients were from unstable accommodation. In the <b>injecting</b> <b>rooms</b> near Madrid 42% of the marginalized target group were homeless, while the number was 60% for the Can Tunis area of Barcelona. In a German study 15% of clients had never accessed addiction treatment of any kind.|$|R

In the experimental Ta/Co$_{ 20 }$Fe$_{ 60 }$B$_{ 20 }$ thin films, the DMI is rather small; nevertheless, the skyrmion bubbles are stable, or at least metastable on observational time scales.

40|$|When He gas is <b>injected</b> from <b>room</b> {{temperature}} into boiling liquid N 2, boiling is suppressed, leaving {{liquid surface}} flat like a mirror. Although the qualitative {{explanation for this}} phenomenon is known [Minkoff G J et al. Nature 1957; 180 (4599) : 1413 - 4. ], {{it has not been}} studied quantitatively and comprehensively yet. In this report, we made careful simultaneous measurements of temperature and weight variation of the liquid.

A cohort of 50 patients undergoing unilateral carpal tunnel decompression was randomized to room temperature or refrigerated local anaesthetic. Pain scores were assessed using a 10 mm visual analogue scale. Mean pain scores were 4. 0 (SD 1. 5) for room temperature and 6. 5 (SD 1. 7) for refrigerated local anaesthetic (P 50. 001). This study demonstrates that patients experience greater pain levels with administration of local anaesthetic at refrigerated temperatures prior to open carpal tunnel release...|$|R
