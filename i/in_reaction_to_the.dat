5|$|In some rhythm games, {{the screen}} {{displays}} an avatar who performs <b>in</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> player's controller inputs.

In single-player modes, the player's avatar competes against a computer-controlled opponent, while multiplayer modes allow two player-controlled avatars to compete head-to-head. The popularity of rhythm games has created a market for speciality input devices. These include controllers that emulate musical instruments, such as guitars, drums, or maracas. A dance mat, for use in dancing games, requires the player to step on pressure-sensitive pads. However, most rhythm games also support more conventional input devices, such as control pads.|$|E
