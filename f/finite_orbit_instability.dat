This conclusion, first noted by Huss, Jain, and Steinmetz, is explored in detail {{through a series}} of numerical experiments involving the collapse of an isolated halo into the non-linear regime.

40|$|Introduction Let G be a {{connected}} linear algebraic group over an algebraically closed field K of characteristic p 0.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{topology}} of inverse limit spaces generated by maps of finite graphs.

We go on to identify the local structure of the inverse limit space at the points that correspond to points in the ω-limit set of f when the turning points of f are not necessarily on a <b>finite</b> <b>orbit.</b> This leads to a new result regarding inverse limits of maps of the interval. 1...|$|R
40|$|For a decade, N-body {{simulations}} {{have revealed}} a nearly universal dark matter density profile, {{which appears to}} be robust to changes in the overall density of the universe and the underlying power spectrum. Despite its universality, the physical origin of this profile has not yet been well understood. Semi [...] analytic models by Barnes et al. (2005) have suggested that the density structure of dark matter halos is determined by the onset of the radial <b>orbit</b> <b>instability</b> (ROI). We have tested this hypothesis using N-body simulations of collapsing dark matter halos with a variety of initial conditions. For dynamically cold initial conditions, the resulting halo structures are triaxial in shape, due to the mild aspect of the instability. We examine how variations in initial velocity dispersion affect the onset of the instability, and find that an isotropic velocity dispersion can suppress the ROI entirely, while a purely radial dispersion does not. The quantity sigma^ 2 /vc^ 2 is a criterion for instability, where regions with sigma^ 2 /vc^ 2 <~ 1 become triaxial due to the ROI or other perturbations. We also find that the radial <b>orbit</b> <b>instability</b> sets a scale length at which the velocity dispersion changes rapidly from isotropic to radially anisotropic. This scale length is proportional to the radius at which the density profile changes shape, {{as is the case in}} the semi [...] analytic models; however, the coefficient of proportionality is different by a factor of ~ 2. 5. We conclude that the radial <b>orbit</b> <b>instability</b> is likely to be a key physical mechanism responsible for the nearly universal profiles of simulated dark matter halos.

40|$|We {{investigate}} a hypothesis regarding {{the origin of}} the scalelength in halos formed in cosmological N-body simulations. This hypothesis can be viewed as an extension of an earlier idea put forth by Merritt and Aguilar. Our findings suggest that a phenomenon related to the radial <b>orbit</b> <b>instability</b> is present in such halos and is responsible for density profile shapes. This instability sets a scalelength at which the velocity dispersion distribution changes rapidly from isotropic to radially anisotropic. This scalelength is reflected in the density distribution as the radius at which the density profile changes slope. We have tested the idea that radially dependent velocity dispersion anisotropy leads to a break in density profile shape by manipulating the input of a semi-analytic model to imitate the velocity structure imposed by the radial <b>orbit</b> <b>instability.</b> Without such manipulation, halos formed are approximated by single power-law density profiles and isotropic velocity distributions. Halos formed with altered inputs display density distributions featuring scalelengths and anisotropy profiles similar to those seen in cosmological N-body simulations.

40|$|Accepted for {{publication}} in ApJ Using a suite of self-gravitating, collisionless N-body models, we systematically explore a parameter space relevant to the onset and behavior of the radial <b>orbit</b> <b>instability</b> (ROI), whose strength {{is measured by the}} systemic axis ratios of the models. We show that a combination of two initial conditions, namely the velocity anisotropy and the virial ratio, determines whether a system will undergo ROI and exactly how triaxial the system will become. A third initial condition, the radial shape of the density profile, plays a smaller, but noticeable role. Regarding the dynamical development of the ROI, the instability a) begins after systems collapse to their most compact configuration and b) evolves fastest when a majority of the particles have radially anisotropic orbits while {{there is a lack of}} centrally-concentrated isotropic orbits. We argue that this is further evidence that self-reinforcing torques are the key to the onset of the ROI. Our findings support the idea that a separate <b>orbit</b> <b>instability</b> plays a role in halting the ROI. Subject headings: galaxies:structure — galaxies:kinematics and dynamics 1...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In this thesis, we classify <b>finite</b> <b>orbits</b> of {{the action of the}} pure braid group over a certain large open subset of the SL(2,C) character variety of the Riemann sphere with five boundary components, i. e. Σ 5. This problem arises in the context of classifying algebraic solutions of the Garnier system G 2, that is the two variable analogue of the famous sixth Painleve equation PVI. The structure of the analytic continuation of these solutions is described in terms of the action of the pure braid group on the fundamental group of Σ 5. To deal with this problem, we introduce a system of co-adjoint coordinates on a big open subset of the SL(2,C) character variety of Σ 5. Our classifica- tion method is based on the definition of four restrictions of the action of the pure braid group such that they act on some of the co-adjoint coordi- nates of Σ 5 as the pure braid group acts on the co-adjoint coordinates of the character variety of the Riemann sphere with four boundary components, i. e.
