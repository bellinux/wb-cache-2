5|$|From 1870 to 1880 {{it became}} clear that cell nuclei are never formed anew but always derived from the {{substance}} of another nucleus. In 1882 Flemming observed the longitudinal splitting of chromosomes in the dividing nucleus and concluded that each <b>daughter</b> <b>nucleus</b> received half of each of the chromosomes of the mother nucleus: then by the early 20th century {{it was found that the}} number of chromosomes in a given species is constant. With genetic continuity confirmed and the finding by Eduard Strasburger that the nuclei of reproductive cells (in pollen and embryo) have a reducing division (halving of chromosomes, now known as meiosis) the field of heredity was opened up. By 1926 Thomas Morgan was able to outline a theory of the gene and its structure and function. The form and function of plastids received similar attention, the association with starch being noted at an early date. With observation of the cellular structure of all organisms and the process of cell division and continuity of genetic material, the analysis of the structure of protoplasm and the cell wall as well as that of plastids and vacuoles â€“ what is now known as cytology, or cell theory became firmly established.|$|E

During the first years she worked together with chemist Otto Hahn and together with him discovered several new isotopes. In 1909 she presented two papers on beta-radiation.

25|$|In {{nuclear fission}} events the nuclei may break into any {{combination}} of lighter nuclei, but the most common event is not fission to equal mass nuclei of about mass120; the most common event (depending on isotope and process) is a slightly unequal fission in which one <b>daughter</b> <b>nucleus</b> has a mass of about 90 to 100u and the other the remaining 130 to 140u. Unequal fissions are energetically more favorable because this allows one product {{to be closer to}} the energetic minimum near mass 60u (only a quarter of the average fissionable mass), while the other nucleus with mass 135u is still not far out of the range of the most tightly bound nuclei (another statement of this, is that the atomic binding energy curve is slightly steeper to the left of mass 120u than to the right of it).|$|E

40|$|In {{eukaryotic}} cells, RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) transcription and pre-mRNA processing are coordinated events. We {{have addressed}} how individual {{components of the}} transcription and pre-mRNA processing machinery are organized during mitosis and subsequently recruited into the newly formed <b>daughter</b> <b>nuclei.</b> Interestingly, localization studies of numerous RNA pol II transcription and pre-mRNA processing factors revealed a nonrandom and sequential entry of these factors into <b>daughter</b> <b>nuclei</b> after nuclear envelope/lamina formation. The initiation competent form of RNA pol II and general transcription factors appeared in the <b>daughter</b> <b>nuclei</b> simultaneously, but prior to pre-mRNA processing factors, whereas the elongation competent form of RNA pol II was detected even later.

Telophase nuclei were competent for transcription and pre-mRNA splicing concomitant with the initial entry of the respective factors. In addition, our results revealed a low turnover rate of transcription and pre-mRNA splicing factors during mitosis.

40|$|The anaphase-telophase spindle usually elongates, and it {{has been}} assumed that the spindle pushes the {{incipient}} <b>daughter</b> <b>nuclei</b> apart. To test this assumption, we used a laser microbeam to sever the central spindle of the fungus, Fusarium solani, and measured the rate of separation of incipient <b>daughter</b> <b>nuclei.</b> When the microbeam was aimed beside the spindle separation occurred at a rate (8. 6 micrometer/min) that did not differ significantly from the rate (7. 6 micrometer/m) in unirradiated cells.

5000|$|Paramecium aurelia is {{the most}} {{commonly}} studied protozoan for autogamy. Similar to other unicellular organisms, Paramecium aurelia typically reproduce asexually via binary fission or sexually via cross-fertilization. However, {{studies have shown that}} when put under nutritional stress, Paramecium aurelia will undergo meiosis and subsequent fusion of gametic-like nuclei. This process, defined as hemixis, a chromosomal rearrangement process, takes place in a number of steps. First, the two micronuclei of Paramecium aurelia enlarge and divide two times to form eight nuclei. Some of these <b>daughter</b> <b>nuclei</b> will continue to divide to create potential future gametic nuclei. Of these potential gametic nuclei, one will divide two more times. Of the four <b>daughter</b> <b>nuclei</b> arising from this step, two of them become anlagen, or cells that will form part of the new organism. The other two <b>daughter</b> <b>nuclei</b> become the gametic micronuclei that will undergo autogamous self-fertilization.

5000|$|Typically, when {{a parent}} nucleus beta-decays into its daughter, {{there is some}} final energy {{available}} which is shared between the final products of the decay. This is called the Q value of the beta decay (QÎ²). The <b>daughter</b> <b>nucleus</b> doesn't necessarily {{end up in the}} ground state after the decay, this only happens when the other products have taken all the available energy with them (usually as kinetic energy). So, in general, the <b>daughter</b> <b>nucleus</b> keeps an amount of the available energy as excitation energy and ends up in an excited state associated to some energy level, as seen in the picture. The <b>daughter</b> <b>nucleus</b> can only stay in that excited state for a small amount of time [...] (the half life of the level) after which it suffers a series of gamma transitions to its lower energy levels.

To test this assumption, we used a laser microbeam to sever the central spindle of the fungus, Fusarium solani, and measured the rate of separation of incipient <b>daughter</b> <b>nuclei.</b> When the microbeam was aimed beside the spindle, separation occurred at a rate (8. 6,um/min) that did not differ significantly from the rate (7. 6 Am/min) in unirradiated cells.
