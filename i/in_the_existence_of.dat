5|$|After the battle, the {{captured}} German panzerarmee general Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma told Montgomery {{that he had}} believed the allies {{had at least one}} more armoured division than they did, and that the attack would be in the south. Rommel's stand-in, general Georg Stumme, thought the attack would not begin for several weeks. German documents and prisoners of war confirmed that the German commanders had believed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> the decoy unit, and had not anticipated the true avenue of attack. Bertram had succeeded in all its objectives.|$|E
5|$|Belief <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> water bulls {{persisted in}} Scotland {{until at least}} {{the last quarter of}} the 19th century. As with many mythological creatures, {{descriptions}} are imprecise. The water bull is able to shapeshift into human form, and live on land or in water. It can be a monstrous, malevolent black beast, especially when described as a tarbh uisge, but not as nasty as the each uisge or water horse. It can also be amiable and sometimes helpful. It differs from the Manx tarroo ushtey, which is more likely to be a resident of marshland.|$|E

5|$|Racism and {{antisemitism}} were basic {{tenets of}} the NSDAP and the Nazi regime. Nazi Germany's racial policy was based on their belief <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> a superior master race. The Nazis postulated {{the existence of a}} racial conflict between the Aryan master race and inferior races, particularly Jews, who were viewed as a mixed race that had infiltrated society and were responsible for the exploitation and repression of the Aryan race.|$|E
5|$|Schlosberg's contribution, is, in many ways, a {{response}} to challenges made to his Defining Environmental Justice (2007). Schlosberg aims to step beyond previous accounts of animal rights or environmentalism as requirements of justice by deploying a mixed capabilities/deliberation approach applicable to both ecosystems and nonhuman animals. Schlosberg challenges criticisms of his capabilities approach (specifically, a capabilities approach which moves beyond humans) grounded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> conflicts of capabilities, claiming that a form of deliberative democracy can overcome the problem posed by these conflicts. His mixed account, he claims, provides a form of justice appropriate for thinking about human and nonhuman individuals and collectives in the Anthropocene.|$|E
5|$|The Almost Nearly Perfect People {{is divided}} into five {{sections}} for Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Finland and Sweden. Beginning with Denmark, Booth explains the Danish concept of hygge ("cosy times"), which he sees as conformism. He criticises the Danish population's environmental footprint and notes that their taxation rate and levels of personal debt are {{among the highest in}} the world. Moving to Iceland, Booth details the banking practices that led to the collapse of the country's largest banks in the 2008 financial crisis, as well as the popular belief among Icelanders <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> Huldufólk (elves).|$|E

5|$|While {{promoting}} Stargate in Europe, Emmerich came up {{with the}} idea for the film when fielding a question about his own belief <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> alien life. He and Dean Devlin decided to incorporate a large-scale attack having noticed that aliens in most invasion films travel long distances in outer space only to remain hidden when reaching Earth. Shooting began in July 1995 in New York City, and the film was officially completed on June 20, 1996.|$|E
5|$|Grim Fandango {{takes place}} in the Land of the Dead (the Eighth Underworld), where {{recently}} departed souls aim to {{make their way to the}} Land of Eternal Rest (the Ninth Underworld). Good deeds in life are rewarded by access to better travel packages to assist in making the journey of the soul, the best of which is the Number Nine, a train that takes four minutes to reach the gate to the Ninth Underworld. Souls who did not lead a kind life are left to travel through the Land of the Dead on foot, which would take around four years. Such souls often lose faith <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> the Ninth Underworld and instead find jobs in the Land of the Dead. The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the Grim Reaper to escort the souls from the mortal world to the Land of the Dead, and then determine which mode of transport the soul has merited. Each year on the Day of the Dead, these souls are allowed to visit their families in the Land of the Living.|$|E
5|$|Others have redefined this concept, {{making it}} {{compatible}} with forming a belief, and only incompatible with absolute certainty. George H. Smith, while admitting that the narrow definition of atheist was the common usage definition of that word, and admitting that the broad definition of agnostic was the common usage definition of that word, promoted broadening {{the definition of}} atheist and narrowing the definition of agnostic. Smith rejects agnosticism as a third alternative to theism and atheism and promotes terms such as agnostic atheism (the view {{of those who do}} not believe <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> any deity, but do not claim to know if a deity does or does not exist) and agnostic theism (the view of those who do not claim to know of the existence of any deity, but still believe in such an existence).|$|E

5|$|Pakistan {{has several}} {{official}} national symbols including a historic document, a flag, an emblem, an anthem, a memorial tower {{as well as}} several national heroes. The symbols were adopted at various stages <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> Pakistan and there are various rules and regulations governing their definition or use. The oldest symbol is the Lahore Resolution, adopted by the All India Muslim League on 23 March 1940, and which presented the official demand {{for the creation of a}} separate country for the Muslims of India. The Minar-e-Pakistan memorial tower which was built in 1968 on the site where the Lahore Resolution was passed. The national flag was adopted just before independence was achieved on 14 August 1947. The national anthem and the state emblem were each adopted in 1954. There are also several other symbols including the national animal, bird, flower and tree.|$|E
5|$|Scholarly {{theories}} {{note the}} similarities between the táltos of Hungarian folklore and Siberian shamans, but the existence of shamans among the ancient Magyars cannot be proven. Many elements of the Hungarian religious vocabulary, including boszorkány ("witch"), elbűvöl ("to charm"), and the ancient Hungarian word for holy (igy or egy), are of Turkic origin. Many of these loanwords were adopted into their Christian vocabulary: búcsú (indulgence), bűn (sin), gyón (confess), isten (god), and ördög (devil). According to Gyula László, a Hungarian children's verse that refers to a fife, a drum, and a reed violin preserves the memory of a pagan ritual for expelling harmful spirits by raising great noise. The refrain of another children's verse, which mentions three days of the week in reverse order, may have preserved an ancient belief <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> an afterlife world where everything is upside-down.|$|E
