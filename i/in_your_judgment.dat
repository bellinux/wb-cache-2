2500|$|I {{am asking}} you to go because of my desire {{to have the best}} {{possible}} on-the-spot appraisal of the military and paramilitary effort to defeat the Viet Cong[...] [...] [...] The events in South Vietnam since May have now raised serious questions both about the present prospects for success against the Viet Cong and still more about the future effectiveness of this effort unless there can be important political improvement in the country. It is in this context that I now need your appraisal of the situation. If the prognosis <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>judgment</b> is not hopeful, I would like your views on what action must be taken by the South Vietnamese Government and what steps our Government should take to lead the Vietnamese to that action.|$|E
2500|$|For the {{upcoming}} attack, Meade {{was concerned that}} the corps of Wright and Smith would not be sufficient, so he attempted to convince Warren to send reinforcements. He wrote to the V Corps commander, [...] "Generals Wright and Smith will attack this evening. It is very desirable you should join this attack, unless <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>judgment</b> it is impracticable." [...] Warren decided to send the division of Brig. Gen. Henry H. Lockwood, which began to march at 6 p.m., but no adequate reconnaissance of the road network had been conducted and Lockwood {{was not able to}} reach the impending battle in time to make a difference. Meade was also concerned about his left flank, which was not anchored on the Chickahominy and was potentially threatened by Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry. He ordered Phil Sheridan to send scouting parties into the area, but Sheridan resisted, telling Meade that {{it would be impossible to}} move his men before dark.|$|E

6000|$|Thirlwell read part of {{the letter}} to Scott, who said, [...] "Miss Strange {{seems to have a}} {{flattering}} confidence <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>judgment.</b> Do you want me to hire the fellow?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have some}} {{confidence}} <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>judgment,</b> Brother Redbrook," [...] answered Mr. Terry of Lee, [...] "and now we've {{looked over the}} goods, it ain't set back any, I callate." ...|$|E

5000|$|Availability: used to {{estimate}} how frequent or likely an event is based on how quickly one can conjure examples of the event. For example, if one were asked to approximate {{the number of people}} <b>in</b> <b>your</b> age group that are currently <b>in</b> college, <b>your</b> <b>judgment</b> would be affected by how many of your own acquaintances are in college.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{the way we}} all begin," [...] said Tom Platt. [...] "The boys {{they make}} believe all the time till they've cheated 'emselves into bein' men, an' so till they die--pretendin' an' pretendin'. I done it on the old Ohio, I know. Stood my first watch--harbor-watch--feelin' finer'n Farragut. Dan's full o' the same kind o' notions. See 'em now, actin' to be genewine moss-backs--every hair a rope-yarn an' blood Stockholm tar." [...] He spoke down the cabin stairs. [...] "'Guess you're mistook <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>judgments</b> fer once, Disko. What in Rome made ye tell us all here the kid was crazy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pardon me, sir, {{it is you}} who {{are guilty}} of an act of rashness <b>in</b> forming <b>your</b> <b>judgment.</b> 'Fancy {{a woman in her}} senses trusting her keys to a man who was once in Bedlam!' Everybody said that of me, when I put Jack to the proof in my own house." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{know the}} object of his visit to you. He has my cheerful consent to go, but not my direction. He wishes to get you and part of your force, one or both, to come here. You already know I should be {{exceedingly}} glad of this if, <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>judgment,</b> it could be without endangering positions and operations in the southwest; and I now repeat what I have more than once said by telegraph: [...] "Do not come or send a man if, <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>judgment,</b> it will endanger any point you deem important to hold, or endangers or delays the Chattanooga expedition." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{would be}} of both {{interest}} and value to us here {{to know how the}} expedition toward East Tennessee is progressing, if <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>judgment</b> you can give us the information with safety.|$|E

6000|$|... "You will derive much {{benefit from}} it," [...] he said slowly, still holding {{my hand and}} looking gravely and sadly into my eyes. [...] "You must {{remember}} that {{what will happen in}} the future is not necessarily bad because it does not fall <b>in</b> with <b>your</b> preconceived ideas of right. Be not hasty <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>judgments.</b> There are certain great rules which must be carried out, at whatever cost to individuals. Their operation may appear to you to be harsh and cruel, but that is as nothing compared with the dangerous precedent which would be established by not enforcing them. The ox and the sheep are safe from us, but the man with the blood of the highest upon his hands should not and shall not live." ...|$|R
50|$|We eagerly desire, furthermore, that, {{as soon as}} possible, you apprise Us {{concerning}} the devotion which animates your clergy and your people regarding the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin and how ardently glows the desire that this doctrine be defined by the Apostolic See.

6000|$|... 'You're {{wrong about}} Wagner, father,' said Arthur, still glancing with {{paternal}} partiality at his sheet of manuscript: 'Lohengrin's {{a very fine}} work, a grand work, I assure you. I won't let you run it down. But, barring that, I think you're pretty nearly right <b>in</b> <b>your</b> main <b>judgment.</b> I'm not modest, and it strikes me somehow that I've invented a genre. That's about what it comes to.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all right--you {{can be a}} great help. I've got {{confidence}} <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>judgment.</b> By the way," [...] {{he asked}} suddenly, [...] "you haven't seen your friend Austen Vane since you got back, have you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall {{remind you}} of that again," [...] he said lightly. [...] "And now, to show you my {{confidence}} <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>judgment,</b> {{in spite of my}} determination to pursue this alone, I am willing to listen to any suggestions from you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her color deepened, and {{her voice}} rose. Alban's patient {{adherence}} to his own view--so courteously and considerately urged--was beginning to try her temper.

6000|$|Soderini {{had written}} {{ironically}} to Florence on February 15: [...] "Cardinal Orsini, in prison, {{shows signs of}} frenzy. I leave your Sublimities to conclude, <b>in</b> <b>your</b> wisdom, the <b>judgment</b> that is formed of such an illness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know but}} that you have done well to keep this from me. At all events it has not--cannot, and should not alter my opinion toward M'liss. You will of course keep it a secret.

40|$|In 1850 Abraham Lincoln {{offered the}} {{following}} advice to new law students: There is a vague popular belief that lawyers are necessarily dishonest [...] . [T]he impression is common, almost universal. Let no young [person) choosing {{the law for}} a calling for a moment yield to the popular belief-resolve to be honest at all events; and if <b>in</b> <b>your</b> own <b>judgment</b> you cannot be an honest lawyer, resolve to be honest without being a lawyer.

60|$|Your {{attention}} is also again called to {{a consideration of}} the question of postal telegraphs and the arguments adduced in support thereof, in the hope that you may take such action in connection therewith as <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>judgment</b> will most contribute to {{the best interests of the}} country.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, I do, Mr. Philander; {{but while}} {{we all love}} him, you alone are best fitted to manage him; for, {{regardless}} of what he may say to you, he respects your great learning, and, therefore, has immense confidence <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>judgment.</b> The poor dear cannot differentiate between erudition and wisdom." ...|$|E
5000|$|John Cassian {{writes in}} [...] "Conferences" [...] that {{discernment}} [...] "is only secured by true humility. And of this humility the first proof {{is given by}} reserving everything (not only what you do but also what you think), for the scrutiny of the elders, {{so as not to}} trust at all <b>in</b> <b>your</b> own <b>judgment</b> but to acquiesce in their decisions in all points, and to acknowledge what ought to be considered good or bad by their traditions".Also it is important that [...] "all extremes are equally harmful" ...|$|R

60|$|That {{had been}} her training, poor soul! her calling in life--a vulgar trickster by day, a wanton by night.

6000|$|... "Harkee, Sir John," [...] {{interrupted}} the Captain, [...] "I'm no botanist, {{and do not}} pretend to more schooling than a sealer has need of for finding his way about the 'arth; but as for a man's being an animal, I just wish to ask you, now, if <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>judgment</b> a hog is also an animal?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some," [...] replied Tarzan, dryly. [...] "Enough to {{know that}} each of you are right <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>judgment</b> of the {{characteristics}} of the lions--you have met.

6000|$|... "What I have to say, sir, {{concerns}} the Signora Castaldi, your daughters' gouvernante. I know, sir, that you repose implicit confidence <b>in</b> her; and <b>your</b> <b>judgment,</b> formed {{after years of}} intimate knowledge, is hardly likely to be shaken by what I have to tell you. I spoke to Matteo about it, and, as he is somewhat of my opinion, I have decided that it is, at least, my duty to tell you all the circumstances, and you can then form your own conclusions." ...|$|R
40|$|The truthmaker theory {{rests on}} the thesis that the link between a true {{judgment}} {{and that in the}} world to which it corresponds is not a one-to-one but rather a one-to-many relation. An analogous thesis in relation to the link between a singular term and that in the world to which it refers is already widely accepted. This is the thesis to the effect that singular reference is marked by vagueness of a sort that is best understood in supervaluationist terms. In what follows we show that the supervaluationist approach to singular reference, when wedded to the truthmaker idea, yields a framework of surprising power, which offers a uniform set of solutions to a range of problems regarding identity, reference and knowledge, problems which have hitherto been dealt with on an ad hoc basis. 1. The Problem of the Many You make a true judgment to the effect that Amundsen flew to the North Pole. On the theory to be advanced in what follows, it is in first approximation a certain oddly demarcated portion of reality—which might be labeled Amundsen’s flight—which makes <b>your</b> <b>judgment</b> true. <b>Your</b> <b>judgment</b> serves to set into relief this portion of reality against a background of other portions of reality which are traced over. At the same time the designated portion of reality somehow necessitates the truth of <b>your</b> <b>judgment,</b> which is to say: in any possible world <b>in</b> which <b>your</b> <b>judgment</b> and that portion of reality exist, <b>your</b> <b>judgment</b> is true...|$|R
60|$|My Lords, <b>in</b> forming <b>your</b> <b>judgment</b> {{upon this}} nefarious proceeding, your Lordships will {{not fail to}} advert to the {{fundamental}} principles, the acknowledged maxims and established rules, of all judgment and justice,--that conviction ought to precede execution, that trial ought to precede conviction, and that a prosecutor's information and evidence {{ought to be the}} preliminary step and substance of the trial. Here everything was reversed: Sir Elijah Impey goes up with the order for execution; the party accused is neither arraigned nor tried; this same Sir Elijah then proceeds to seek for witnesses and to take affidavits; and in the mean time neither the Nabob, the ostensible prosecutor, nor his mother and grandmother, the parties accused, knew one word of the matter.|$|R
