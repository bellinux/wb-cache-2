5|$|Historian Nancy Bristow {{has argued}} that the pandemic, when {{combined}} with the increasing number of women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing. This was {{due in part to the}} failure of medical doctors, who were predominantly men, to contain and prevent the illness. Nursing staff, who were predominantly women, <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> inclined to celebrate the success of their patient care and less inclined to identify the spread of the disease with their own work.|$|E
5|$|In February 2008, Paramount {{announced}} they would move Star Trek from its December 25, 2008 release date to May 8, 2009, as the studio <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> people {{would see the}} film during summer than winter. The film was practically finished {{by the end of}} 2008. Paramount's decision came about after visiting the set and watching dailies, as they realized the film could appeal to a much broader audience. Even though the filmmakers liked the Christmas release date, Damon Lindelof acknowledged it would allow more time to perfect the visual effects. The months-long gap between the completion of the production and release meant Alan Dean Foster was allowed to watch the whole film before writing the novelization, although the novel would contain scenes absent from the final edit. Quinto narrated the audiobook.|$|E

5|$|The {{earthquake}} produced shaking at Pangandaran (where the M6.3 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake was <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> strongly) {{of intensity}} III–IV (Weak–Light), intensity III at Cianjur, and II (Weak) at Yogyakarta. Further inland and {{farther from the}} epicenter, intensity IV shaking made tall buildings sway in Jakarta, but at some coastal villages {{where many of the}} casualties occurred, the shaking was not felt as strong. An informal survey of 67 people that were present at the time revealed that in at least eight cases, individuals stated that they did not feel the earthquake at all (a typical M7.7 earthquake would have been distinctly noticed at those distances). The unusually low felt intensities, along with the short period body wave magnitudes, were components of the event that narrowed its classification into that of a tsunami earthquake.|$|E
5|$|From 1937 Burnet was {{involved}} in a variety of scientific and public policy bodies, starting with a position on a government advisory council on polio. After he became the director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in 1944, he was considered a public figure and overcame shyness to become a good public speaker. He recognised the importance of co-operation with the media if the general public was to understand science and scientists, and his writings and lectures played an important part in the formulation of public attitudes and policy in Australia on a variety of biological topics. However, despite making many appearances on radio and television, he never became at ease with interviews and had to be selective with outreach engagements due to the many invitations he received, and tended to accept those that had the potential to promote the Institute. Over time, he began to increase his activism, as he <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> confident that {{he would be able to}} make an impact as his reputation grew, especially after winning the Nobel Prize, and even more so after his retirement from the directorship of the Institute. Although Burnet was not naturally outgoing, he saw it as the social responsibility of a scientific leader and scholar to publicly speak out and impart wisdom and foresight to the wider community.|$|E

5|$|The {{series was}} filmed over a seven-week period at the couple's home in Malibu and nearby locations. Production began in August 2011, with an {{original}} release date scheduled for January 2012. The title was set as Shannen Says before its premiere, and the wedding took place and was filmed on October 15, 2011. The series {{was produced by}} Doherty's company, No Apologies Production. Although she was initially hesitant {{about the lack of}} privacy during filming, she <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> comfortable when the bedroom was set as off-limits for the show. David Tutera, a wedding planner and host of My Fair Wedding with David Tutera, acted as Doherty's event planner. The series also featured Doherty's friends, Roxana Zal, Tim Bitici, and Roger Castillo, and her mother, Rosa. According to Doherty, her mother was well-received by fans on Twitter. Doherty explained that viewers liked that her mother appeared more naturally rather than being styled by the show's crew.|$|E
5|$|However, by 1783 Forster {{saw that}} his {{involvement}} with the Rosicrucians not only led him away from real science, but also deeper into debt (it is {{said he was not}} good at money); for these reasons Forster was happy to accept a proposal by the Polish Komisja Edukacji Narodowej (Commission of National Education) and became Chair of Natural History at Vilnius University in 1784. Initially, he was accepted well in Vilnius, but he <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> and more isolated with time. Most of his contacts were still with scientists in Germany; especially notable is his dispute with Immanuel Kant about the definition of race. In 1785, Forster traveled to Halle where he submitted his thesis on the plants of the South Pacific for a doctorate in medicine. Back in Vilnius, Forster's ambitions to build a real natural history scientific center could not get appropriate financial support from the Polish authorities. Moreover, his famous speech on natural history in 1785 went almost unnoticed and was not printed until 1843. These events led to high tensions between him and the local community. Eventually, he broke the contract six years short of its completion as Catherine II of Russia had offered him a place on a journey around the world (the Mulovsky expedition) for a high honorarium and a position as a professor in Saint Petersburg. This resulted in a conflict between Forster and the influential Polish scientist Jędrzej Śniadecki. However, the Russian proposal was withdrawn and Forster left Vilnius. He then settled in Mainz, where he became head librarian of the University of Mainz, a position held previously by his friend Johannes von Müller, who made sure Forster would succeed him when Müller moved to the administration of Elector Friedrich Karl Josef von Erthal.|$|E
5|$|In past Zelda titles, {{the team}} had made {{numerous}} new fields for player exploration, but this time they limited the number of overworlds to three and expanded their content so players {{would be able to}} full appreciate them through repeated visits. The team also created the world based on their experiences with Twilight Princess: feeling that the overworld and dungeons were too large with puzzles too thinly dispersed, the team both sought to compact areas and have environmental puzzles in the overworld. The biggest difficulty was ensuring that players could reach areas quickly while still discovering new features and puzzles. The creation of the Skyloft overworld was due to difficulties connecting the three Surface-based overworlds with each other due to drastically contrasting environments. The sky was initially going to be presented similar to the course selection screen from the Super Mario series, but this was changed to an overworld with its own quests and population so Link had a place where he could prepare for his adventures. An initial idea, when jumping down from the sky seemed unlikely to be approved, was to have a huge tower acting as a central hub, with the height at which Link jumped lengthening the duration of his free fall. Once the concept of traveling from the sky had been chosen instead, the Loftwing mounts were created so it looked and <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> rational to players. These overlapping gameplay mechanics triggered the creation of Skyloft, along with elements of the early game such as the Knight Academy. The continual movements and routines of Skyloft's people were modeled after similar time-driven mechanics from , with similar links between character-specific side quests and the main narrative. Despite the aerial element, the mechanics necessary for free navigation meant a Loftwing racing minigame could not be implemented.|$|E

5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} {{session was}} divided into three parts. The first part ran for twenty minutes and eliminated the cars that finished the session eighteenth or lower. The second part of qualifying lasted fifteen minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions eleven to seventeen. The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth and decided pole position. Cars which competed in the final session of qualifying {{were not allowed to}} change tyres before the race. They started the race fitted with the tyres used when they set their quickest lap times. Vettel set the fastest times {{in the second and third}} sessions and clinched his fourth pole position of the season with a time of 1:37.587. It was the Red Bull team's eighth pole in the season's nine races. He was joined on the grid's front row by Webber who recorded a lap time 0.075 seconds slower than Vettel. Hamilton qualified third but locked his rear tyres on his final timed heading into turn 17 and slowed down, preventing him from improving his grid position. The two Ferrari drivers were fourth and fifth (with Alonso ahead of Massa); Massa encountered slower cars which prevented him from gaining optimum tyre temperature and could not improve his fastest lap time. Kubica took sixth position and <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> movement on his Renault when he had the medium compound tyre equipped. Button had oversteer through turn 24 and made a mistake in the following corner which restricted him to seventh. Nico Hülkenberg was eighth, ahead of Williams teammate Barrichello in ninth who was affected by a brake-warm up problem. Petrov rounded out the top ten and made mistakes on his final timed lap which prevented him from getting a better starting position.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{immediately}} guided Palace {{back to the}} Premier League as runaway {{champions of}} the second tier, Chris Armstrong top-scoring with 23 league goals. During this period the badge was changed with the bird being replaced by one which Ron Noades <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> closely resembled an eagle. 1995 again saw the club making news for off the field reasons. On 25 January 1995 Palace played Manchester United at Selhurst Park. Following a bad tackle on Richard Shaw, United's maverick French forward Eric Cantona was sent off. As Cantona walked towards the tunnel he was taunted by Palace fan Matthew Simmons. This angered Cantona, who launched a flying kick at him with both feet. Manchester United suspended Cantona {{for the remainder of}} the season, while the French Football Federation dropped Cantona from the France national football team, and stripped Cantona of the captaincy of Les Bleus. Cantona was sentenced to two weeks in jail; this was reduced to 120 hours community service on appeal. Simmons was immediately banned from Selhurst Park, and in 1996 was found guilty of two charges of using threatening words and behaviour towards Cantona. More was to follow at Selhurst in March, when Chris Armstrong was suspended by the FA for failing a drugs test. In 1995 Palace reached the semi-finals of both domestic cups, but a shortage of Premier League goals counted against them alongside the introduction of a fourth relegation place. The Premiership was being cut from 22 to 20 clubs at the end of the 1994–95 season, and Palace found themselves demoted on the last day of the season once again.|$|E
