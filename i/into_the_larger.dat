5|$|A soap bubble forms a sphere, {{a surface}} with minimal area — the {{smallest}} possible surface {{area for the}} volume enclosed.

5|$|Strong shear {{associated}} with the outflow of Cyclone Olaf caused all convection {{associated with}} Nancy to be displaced to the southwest on February16. Early on February17, Nancy transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as it entered the area of responsibility of the Tropical cyclone warning centre (TCWC) in Wellington, New Zealand. Shortly after, the low was absorbed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> circulation of Olaf. However, TCWC Wellington continued to monitor Nancy as a separate system until 1200UTC on February18.|$|E
5|$|For half an hour, Lion {{continued}} to fire <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> Guillaume Tell, but Dixon {{was unable to}} keep his ship completely {{out of range of}} the French broadsides and by 05:30 the subsequent damage showed an effect, Lion dropping back and falling behind the French vessel, although remaining within range alongside Penelope. At 06:00, Guillaume Tell came under attack for the third time, when Berry himself caught up with the battling ships in Foudroyant and pulled along the starboard broadside of the French ship of the line. Berry hailed Decrés to demand his surrender, and accompanied the demand with a triple-shotted broadside, to which Decrés responded with fire from his own guns. Foudroyant was flying a full set of sails and therefore suffered severe damage to its rigging in the opening exchange, the additional speed provided by this rig forcing Foudroyant to move ahead of the French vessel. After working back alongside Guillaume Tell, Berry recommenced fire that rapidly tore away much of the remaining French rigging, allowing Lion and Penelope to return to the battle while Foudroyant dropped back to make urgent repairs.|$|E

This series also saw the introduction of Ben Ward, Richard Webb and Gerard Foster (known as Ben, Gez & Rich) of The Cheese Shop {{who took over the}} comedy from 'Trev and Simon'. With them came new sketches including The Staffroom which featured the three of them portray school teachers Mr Wazzock (Foster), Mr Moody (Ward) and Mr Slack (Webb). They also created a fictitious 60s pop group called The Krazees and even created a song called We're So Crazy even though it was never released.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{proteins}} that bind DNA are well-understood examples of non-specific DNA-protein interactions. Within chromosomes, DNA {{is held in}} complexes with structural proteins. These proteins organize the DNA into a compact structure called chromatin. In eukaryotes, this structure involves DNA binding to a complex of small basic proteins called histones, while in prokaryotes multiple types of proteins are involved. The histones form a disk-shaped complex called a nucleosome, which contains two complete turns of double-stranded DNA wrapped around its surface. These non-specific interactions are formed through basic residues in the histones, making ionic bonds to the acidic sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA, and are thus largely independent of the base sequence. Chemical modifications of these basic amino acid residues include methylation, phosphorylation, and acetylation. These chemical changes alter {{the strength of the}} interaction between the DNA and the histones, making the DNA more or less accessible to transcription factors and changing the rate of transcription. Other non-specific DNA-binding proteins in chromatin include the high-mobility group proteins, which bind to bent or distorted DNA. These proteins are important in bending arrays of nucleosomes and arranging them <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> structures that make up chromosomes.|$|E
5|$|The bucket bong is {{made out}} of two {{container}}s, with the larger, open top container filled with water. The smaller has an attached bowl and open bottom, and the smaller is placed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger.</b> Once the bowl is lit, the operator must move the small container up, causing a pressure difference. Smoke slowly fills the small jar until the user removes the bowl and inhales the contents. A waterfall bong is made up of only one container. The container must have a bowl and a small hole near the base so the water can drain easily. As the water flows out of the container, air is forced through the bowl and causes the substance to burn and accumulate smoke in the bong.|$|E

5|$|The {{degree to}} which {{any one of these}} forces held sway over others is unclear. Preference for one {{explanation}} over another is sometimes predicated upon a given political viewpoint. The cumulative effect of these dynamics is that {{by the beginning of the}} 20th century the Plains Aborigines were almost completely acculturated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> ethnic Han group, and had experienced nearly total language shift from their respective Formosan languages to Chinese. In addition, legal barriers to the use of traditional surnames persisted until the 1990s, and cultural barriers remain. Aborigines were not permitted to use their traditional names on official identification cards until 1995 when a ban on using aboriginal names dating from 1946 was finally lifted. One obstacle is that household registration forms allow a maximum of 15 characters for personal names. However, aboriginal names are still phonetically translated into Chinese characters, and many names require more than the allotted space.|$|E
5|$|The precise {{founding}} of the Gophers men's basketball program at the University of Minnesota is somewhat nebulous. Unlike many other universities with later foundations, the team did not form as a conscious act of the campus administration. The University's student newspaper at the time, the Ariel, reported on basketball throughout 1895 as the sport {{was introduced to the}} campus from a rival school, Minnesota A in St. Paul, later incorporated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> University of Minnesota Twin Cities. In 1896, a team from the school began to participate in a league with the Agriculture school, YMCA teams, and other local associations. The establishment of the Armory on-campus gave the team a new place to play. In February 1897, L. J. Cooke, a director of the Minneapolis YMCA, was hired on a part-time basis to coach the basketball program, and became the full-time coach and director of physical education by the fall of that year. Cooke {{was one of the first}} full-time professional coaches in all of college basketball and would remain at the program for 28 seasons.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Edouard was {{the first}} of eight named storms to form in September 2002, the most such storms in the North Atlantic for any month at the time. The fifth {{tropical}} storm of the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season, Edouard developed into a tropical cyclone on September 1 from an area of convection associated with a cold front east of Florida. Under weak steering currents, Edouard drifted to the north and executed a clockwise loop to the west. Despite moderate to strong levels of wind shear, the storm reached a peak intensity of 65mph (100km/h) on September 3, but quickly weakened as it tracked westward. Edouard made landfall on northeastern Florida on September 5, and after crossing the state it dissipated on September 6 while becoming absorbed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> circulation of Tropical Storm Fay.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after peaking in intensity, Tropical Storm Edouard {{began to}} weaken as {{convection}} diminished from vertical shear and dry air, {{and later on}} September 3 the center was exposed from the steadily decreasing convection. The development of a weak and narrow mid-level ridge turned the storm to the west-southwest towards northeastern Florida. Despite strong levels of wind shear, Edouard remained a tropical storm while producing sporadic amounts of deep convection, and on September 4 the banding structure improved. Early on September 5, Edouard made landfall near Ormond Beach, Florida as a minimal tropical storm, and almost immediately weakened to a tropical depression over land. It tracked across the state for about 13hours and entered the Gulf of Mexico near Crystal River. Initial forecasts predicted Edouard to restrengthen to a tropical storm over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, though uncertainty was noted due {{to the development of}} Tropical Storm Fay in the northwestern portion of the gulf. Upon entering the Gulf of Mexico, the depression encountered strong wind shear from the outflow of Tropical Storm Fay. Edouard generated minimal amounts of intermittent convection along the southeastern portion of its circulation, enough for it to remain a tropical cyclone. By September 6 the remaining convection dissipated, and Edouard dissipated while becoming absorbed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> circulation of Tropical Storm Fay.|$|E
