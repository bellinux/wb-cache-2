5|$|Topical {{preparations}} of zinc {{include those}} {{used on the}} skin, often {{in the form of}} zinc oxide. Zinc preparations can protect against sunburn in the summer and windburn in the winter. Applied thinly to a baby's <b>diaper</b> area (perineum) with each <b>diaper</b> change, it can protect against <b>diaper</b> rash.|$|E
5|$|Napkin {{psoriasis}} is a subtype of psoriasis {{common in}} infants characterized by red papules with silver {{scale in the}} <b>diaper</b> area that may extend to the torso or limbs. Napkin psoriasis is often misdiagnosed as napkin dermatitis (<b>diaper</b> rash).|$|E

25|$|An average {{child will}} go through several {{thousand}} <b>diapers</b> in their life. Since disposable <b>diapers</b> are discarded after a single use, usage of disposable <b>diapers</b> increases the burden on landfill sites, and increased environmental awareness {{has led to a}} growth in campaigns for parents to use reusable alternatives such as cloth or hybrid <b>diapers.</b> An estimated 27.4 billion disposable <b>diapers</b> are used each year in the US, resulting in a possible 3.4 million tons of used <b>diapers</b> adding to landfills each year.|$|R
25|$|<b>Diapers</b> {{are made}} of cloth or {{synthetic}} disposable materials. Cloth <b>diapers</b> are composed of layers of fabric such as cotton, hemp, bamboo, microfiber, or even plastic fibers such as PLA, and can be washed and reused multiple times. Disposable <b>diapers</b> contain absorbent chemicals and are thrown away after use. Plastic pants can be worn over <b>diapers</b> to avoid leaks, but with modern cloth <b>diapers,</b> {{this is no longer}} necessary.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{aspect to}} {{consider}} when choosing between disposable <b>diapers</b> and cloth <b>diapers</b> is cost. [...] It is estimated that an average baby will use from $1,500 to $2,000 or more in disposable <b>diapers</b> before being potty-trained. [...] In contrast, cloth <b>diapers,</b> while initially more expensive than disposables, cost as low as $300 for a basic set of cloth <b>diapers,</b> although costs can rise with more expensive options. [...] The cost of washing and drying <b>diapers</b> must also be considered. [...] The basic set, if one-sized, can last from birth to potty-training.|$|R
5|$|Bubbles {{was kept}} at the Jackson family's Encino home until 1988 {{when he was}} moved to Jackson's newly {{acquired}} Neverland Ranch. There, Bubbles slept in a crib in the singer's bedroom, ate candy in the Neverland movie theater, was fed at the dining table, wore a <b>diaper,</b> and relieved himself in Jackson's personal toilet.|$|E
5|$|Brian and Stewie {{visit the}} local Quahog bank so that Brian can deposit holiday {{money in his}} safe deposit box. Stewie then {{wants to go to}} a store to return a $3,000 Thom Browne sweater. While they are still inside the vault, the door closes {{at the end of the}} work day and locks them inside until the next morning. Frightened, Stewie soils his <b>diaper.</b> Worried he will get a rash from the dirty <b>diaper,</b> Stewie desperately tries to make Brian eat his feces by {{threatening}} him with a gun that Brian had stored in his deposit box. They discover that Stewie has a cellphone in his pocket, but there's only enough charge in the battery for one short phone call. Unfortunately, Stewie uses the last of the phone's battery charge to call the clothing store rather than for help. Enraged, Brian hits Stewie, throws his phone on the ground (thus breaking the phone), and yells at Stewie, making him cry. Instantly remorseful and wanting to repair his relationship with Stewie, Brian reluctantly agrees to eat Stewie's feces in order to provide him with a clean <b>diaper</b> and make up for making Stewie cry. While watching Brian eating, Stewie becomes nauseated and throws up; Stewie then convinces Brian to eat his puke, correctly pointing out that Brian likes the taste of vomit. Realizing that he has nothing to clean his bottom with, Stewie manages to convince Brian to clean his bottom with his tongue in order to avoid infection, much to Stewie's pleasure. Afterward, they both decide to take a nap, but soon they realize that the next day is Sunday, meaning that they will have to wait another day before they can be released from the vault.|$|E
5|$|As Marge {{prepares to}} leave Vancouver, she reveals to Homer {{that she is}} left-handed, but has always used her right hand to avoid seeming unusual (due to years of using her right hand, it renders her cross-dominant). She has enough dexterity to change Maggie's <b>diaper</b> and dress her one-handed. They return to the rink {{just in time to}} stop Seymour from {{forfeiting}} the match and go on to defeat Sweden for the gold. Agnes softens her attitude of unyielding contempt toward her son after he breaks his broom and has to drop out, and Marge and Homer agree that they had a great date night.|$|E
25|$|The <b>diapers</b> used on primates, canines, etc. {{are much}} like the <b>diapers</b> used by humans. The <b>diapers</b> used on equines are {{intended}} to catch excretions, as opposed to absorbing them.|$|R

5|$|During that era, {{hospital}} {{nurses and}} midwives were {{trained on the}} job. Schwester Selma trained and supervised all the nurses, operating-room nurses, and midwives in the hospital, teaching the former {{how to make a}} hospital bed and the latter how to <b>diaper</b> newborns and swaddle infants. Sometimes she also substituted for the midwives, who did not live on the premises. For many years, Schwester Selma was Dr. Wallach's right-hand assistant in the areas of uterine curettages, tracheotomies, and ritual circumcisions, accompanied him on house calls, and stood in for him as hospital director when he was away. From 1916 to 1930 she was also in charge of supplies and building maintenance, and making sure the kashrut in the kitchen met Dr. Wallach's strict standards.|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) offers free family {{portraits in}} the office, and {{many members of}} the office take {{advantage}} of the opportunity, including Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) with his very elderly parents, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) with his teenaged daughter Sasha, Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) with her teenaged son, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) with Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy), a desperate Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) trying to win back Kelly's affection yet again, and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) with a reluctant Jim (John Krasinski) and their children Cecelia and Philip. Senator Robert Lipton (Jack Coleman) later comes by with his and Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) son Philip to also get a family portrait. Jim suspects that Dwight's motive for giving away family portraits was to get revenge on Jim for a prank involving a fake Velcro suit, but Dwight's real motive was to try to get some of Philip Lipton's DNA to run a test to determine who Philip's actual father is. Angela is very much against this idea and tries to ensure that Dwight does not get the opportunity. After taking the pictures, Robert notices that Philip's <b>diaper</b> is full, so he goes to change him. After doing so Dwight goes into the bathroom to retrieve the <b>diaper,</b> but Angela chases after him as he makes a break for the hospital to run the DNA test. Dwight and Angela then take part in a high-speed car chase until Dwight calls his cousin Mose (Michael Schur) to take her off his trail with a duplicate Trans Am. Angela later finds him in the hospital waiting area, where he confirms {{he is going to be}} there for the entire 72-hour waiting period for the DNA results. After she sits down, holding his hand, Dwight begins kissing her and Angela briefly demurs before passionately kissing him in return.|$|E
5|$|Pam (Jenna Fischer) and Jim Halpert's (John Krasinski) {{daughter}} CeCe {{is being}} christened, and Michael Scott (Steve Carell) has invited {{all the members}} of the office to the service, much to their disappointment. During the service, CeCe's dress is ruined when Jim changes her <b>diaper.</b> Jim scrambles to replace the gown, and CeCe is eventually baptized in an Arcade Fire T-shirt he found in the back of his car. At the end of the mass, the minister announces there will be a reception hosted by Jim and Pam, who panic because the reception was for family only and they are not prepared for so many guests.|$|E
50|$|Nearly 20 years ago, Marlene Sandberg {{found herself}} {{thinking}} about <b>diapers,</b> and doing so {{on a regular}} basis. She {{was the mother of}} two boys and had a burgeoning sense of environmental awareness. It was during this period that Marlene came across a Swedish newspaper article reporting on the damaging effect that disposable <b>diapers</b> had on the environment. On average, every Swedish baby was responsible for a half-ton of dirty <b>diapers</b> every year. So the <b>diapers</b> kept piling up, {{due in part to the}} material in traditional disposable <b>diapers</b> being predominately oil-derived plastic.|$|R
2500|$|In 2002, the Vienna {{city council}} {{proposed}} that horses {{be made to}} wear <b>diapers</b> {{to prevent them from}} defecating in the street. [...] This caused controversy amongst animal rights groups, who claimed that wearing <b>diapers</b> would be uncomfortable for the animals. [...] The campaigners protested by lining the streets wearing <b>diapers</b> themselves, which spelled out the message [...] "Stop pooh bags". [...] In the Kenyan town of Limuru, donkeys were also <b>diapered</b> at the council's behest. [...] A similar scheme in Blackpool ordered that horses be fitted with rubber and plastic <b>diapers</b> to stop them littering the promenade with dung. [...] The council consulted the RSPCA to ensure that the <b>diapers</b> were not harmful to the horses' welfare.|$|R
50|$|Some {{rubber and}} plastic fetishists have an {{affinity}} for <b>diapers</b> and rubber pants. In the case of disposable <b>diapers,</b> this attraction would be to their crinkly plastic backing. In the case of cloth <b>diapers,</b> it would be towards the latex or pvc of the pants worn over them.|$|R
5|$|As Peter and Lois {{are having}} sex, she yells out George Clooney's name, so Peter realizes {{that she is}} imagining him as Clooney to {{maintain}} her libido. Lois and Peter decide {{to take a second}} honeymoon to enliven their marriage, and leave their anthropomorphic dog Brian {{to take care of their}} children Stewie, Chris, and Meg. Brian is unable to control the children, but Stewie offers to help (in exchange for Brian changing his <b>diaper)</b> and together they manage the home. The pair chaperone a dance at Chris's school, during which a school staff member catches Chris in the boys' restroom with vodka that belongs to his classmate Jake Tucker. Although Brian and Stewie punish Chris by grounding him, they try to clear his name. Jake's father Tom refuses to believe Brian and Stewie, so they resort to planting cocaine in Jake's locker, and Jake is sentenced to community service.|$|E
5|$|Zinc {{compounds}} {{were probably}} used by early humans, in processed and unprocessed forms, as a paint or medicinal ointment, but their composition is uncertain. The use of pushpanjan, probably zinc oxide, as a salve for eyes and open wounds, is {{mentioned in the}} Indian medical text the Charaka Samhita, thought to date from 500 BC or before. Zinc oxide ointment is also mentioned by the Greek physician Dioscorides (1st century AD.) Avicenna mentions zinc oxide in The Canon of Medicine (1025 AD), which mentioned it as a preferred treatment {{for a variety of}} skin conditions, including skin cancer. Though it is no longer used for treating skin cancer, it is still widely used to treat a variety of other skin conditions, in products such as baby powder and creams against <b>diaper</b> rashes, calamine cream, anti-dandruff shampoos, and antiseptic ointments.|$|E

50|$|Some public pools require swim <b>diapers</b> for use {{by young}} {{children}} and the incontinent out of hygiene concerns. For the same reason, other pools do not allow swim <b>diapers</b> at all. Sick children who are not potty-trained and do not wear swim <b>diapers</b> {{may be responsible for}} the transmission of e. coli from fecal matter.|$|R
25|$|After the Second World War, mothers {{increasingly}} wanted {{freedom from}} washing <b>diapers</b> {{so that they}} could work and travel, causing an increasing demand for disposable <b>diapers.</b>|$|R
25|$|A {{disposable}} <b>diaper</b> {{may also}} include an inner fabric {{designed to hold}} moisture against the skin {{for a brief period}} before absorption to alert a toilet training or bedwetting user that they have urinated. Most materials in the <b>diaper</b> are held together {{with the use of a}} hot-melt adhesive, which is applied in spray form or multi lines, an elastic hot melt is also used to help with pad integrity when the <b>diaper</b> is wet.|$|E
25|$|A <b>diaper</b> (American English) or a nappy (British English) {{is a type}} of {{underwear}} that allows the wearer to defecate or urinate without the use of a toilet, by absorbing or containing waste products to prevent soiling of outer clothing or the external environment. When diapers become soiled, they require changing, generally by a second person such as a parent or caregiver. Failure to change a <b>diaper</b> on a sufficiently regular basis can result in skin problems around the area covered by the <b>diaper.</b>|$|E

40|$|One of the {{challenging}} {{issues to be}} dealt in priority and of any country's agenda today is the management of solid waste, {{and it is a}} difficulty to environmentalists also. <b>Diapers</b> are one of the important products leading to this waste management issue. <b>Diapers</b> are classified into two major categories: single use (disposable) and reusable. Landfills of any country are mainly clogged with disposable products, such as <b>diapers.</b> It is one of the problematic topics of today that needs to be investigated in detail. There is a longstanding debate among environmentalists to conclude disposable and reusable <b>diapers</b> in terms of which one poses more threat to the environment. The authors aim to critically review this issue and discusses the major findings from the previous studies along with highlighting of the gaps in the literature in each area of environmental impact studies on <b>diapers.</b> They also recommend the scope for further research as far as the studies associated with <b>diapers</b> are concerned.

25|$|Other common {{features}} of disposable diapers include {{one or more}} pairs of either adhesive or mechanical fastening tapes to keep the <b>diaper</b> securely fastened. Some diapers have tapes which are refastenable to allow adjusting of fit or reapplication after inspection. Elasticized fabric single and double gussets around the leg and waist areas aid in fitting and in containing urine or stool {{which has not been}} absorbed. Some diapers lines now commonly include wetness indicators, in which a chemical included in the fabric of the <b>diaper</b> changes color in the presence of moisture to alert the carer or user that the <b>diaper</b> is wet.|$|E
25|$|An adult <b>diaper</b> (or adult nappy) is a <b>diaper</b> {{made to be}} worn by {{a person}} with a body larger than that of an infant or toddler.
