25|$|For {{a number}} of years (both before and during the Inprise name) Borland {{suffered}} from serious financial losses and poor public image. When the name was changed to Inprise, many thought Borland had gone out of business. In March 1999, <b>dBase</b> was sold to KSoft, Inc. which was soon renamed to <b>dBASE</b> Inc. (In 2004 <b>dBASE</b> Inc. was renamed to DataBased Intelligence, Inc.).|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} {{problems that}} arose with the Ashton-Tate merger were {{a large part}} of the fall. Ashton-Tate's product portfolio proved to be weak, with no provision for evolution into the GUI environment of Windows. Almost all product lines were discontinued. The consolidation of duplicate support and development offices was costly and disruptive. Worst of all, the highest revenue earner of the combined company was <b>dBASE</b> with no Windows version ready. Borland had an internal project to clone <b>dBASE</b> which was intended to run on Windows and was part of the strategy of the acquisition, but by late 1992 this was abandoned due to technical flaws and the company had to constitute a replacement team (the ObjectVision team, redeployed) headed by Bill Turpin to redo the job. Borland lacked the financial strength to project its marketing and move internal resources off other products to shore up the dBASE/W effort. Layoffs occurred in 1993 to keep the company afloat, the third instance of this in five years. By the time <b>dBASE</b> for Windows eventually shipped, the developer community had moved on to other products such as Clipper or FoxBase and <b>dBASE</b> never regained significant share of Ashton-Tate's former market. This happened against the backdrop of the rise in Microsoft's combined Office product marketing.|$|E
25|$|In September 1991 Borland {{purchased}} Ashton-Tate, {{bringing the}} <b>dBase</b> and InterBase databases to the house, in an all-stock transaction. Competition with Microsoft was fierce. Microsoft launched the competing database Microsoft Access {{and bought the}} <b>dBase</b> clone FoxPro in 1992, undercutting Borland's prices. During the early 1990s Borland's implementation of C and C++ outsold Microsoft's. Borland survived as a company, but {{no longer had the}} dominance in software tools that it once had. It has gone through a radical transition in products, financing, and staff, now a very different company from the one which challenged Microsoft and Lotus in the early 1990s.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{describes}} how 3 <b>D?based</b> visualization and interaction techniques {{can be used}} in information retrieval user interfaces. It demonstrates that information retrieval systems based on state of the art retrieval models can be supplied with an intuitive interface functionality by applying the cone?tree metaphor for the visualization of content spaces. The natural ability of humans for spatial perception, orientation and spatial memories is outlined as an advantage in the process of perceiving information spaces by means of spatial metaphors. It is shown how the models, concepts and mechanisms of the retrieval system underlying its user interface can become more transparent and perceptible for the user at the interface level and how some of the cognitive costs of navigations in information spaces can be reduced. This goal is achieved by transforming document?term networks with two levels of abstraction into hierarchical and directed cone trees that use the spatial depth of 3 D to achieve an easy perception of their topological structure. Finally the paper presents a 3 <b>D?based</b> information system user interface which gives the user intuitive control over content?oriented search paths resulting in a query generation for the underlying automatic retrieval mechanisms. In order to improve the presentation of the query results as well, it is shown that 3 <b>D?based</b> graphical metaphors can provide very intuitive ways of perceiving the relevance of the result in accordance to the query...|$|R
50|$|Esber's {{relationship}} with Wayne Ratliff, however, was tumultuous, and Ratliff quit several months later. Eventually {{a group of}} sales and marketing employees left to join Ratliff at Migent Corporation to compete with Ashton Tate. Later (January 1987), Ashton-Tate would sue Migent for alleged misappropriation of trade secrets. Ratliff would eventually approach Esber about rejoining Ashton-Tate and insisting on reporting directly to him. Jeb Long took over as <b>dBASE's</b> main architect in Ratliff's absence.|$|R
5000|$|... <b>dBase's</b> {{database}} {{system was}} one of the first to provide a header section for describing the structure of the data in the file. This meant that the program no longer required advance knowledge of the data structure, but rather could ask the data file how it was structured. There are several variations on the [...]dbf file structure, and not all dBase-related products and [...]dbf file structures are compatible. VP-Info is unique in that it can read all variants of the dbf file structure.|$|R
25|$|Older {{mainframe}} databases, and {{the newer}} microcomputer based systems that {{were based on}} them, generally {{did not have a}} SQL-like command processor between the user and the database engine. Instead, the data was accessed directly by the program – a programming library in the case of large mainframe systems, or a command line interface or interactive forms system in the case of <b>dBASE</b> and similar applications. Data from <b>dBASE</b> could not generally be accessed directly by other programs running on the machine. Those programs may be given a way to access this data, often through libraries, but it would not work with any other database engine, or even different databases in the same engine. In effect, all such systems were static, which presented considerable problems.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{delays in}} {{software}} are the developers' fault. In 1986, the American National Standards Institute adopted SQL {{as the standard}} database manipulation language. Software company Ashton-Tate was ready to release <b>dBase</b> IV, but pushed the release date back to add support for SQL. The company believed that the product would not be competitive without it. As the word became more commonly used by writers in the mid-1980s, InfoWorld magazine editor James Fawcette wrote that its negative connotations were unfair to developers because {{of these types of}} circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the basic}} {{concepts}} and mechanisms of early versions of MS-DOS resembled those of CP/M. Internals like file-handling data structures were identical, and both referred to disk drives with a letter (A:, B:, etc.). MS-DOS's main innovation was its FAT file system. This similarity {{made it easier to}} port popular CP/M software like WordStar and <b>dBase.</b> However, CP/M's concept of separate user areas for files on the same disk was never ported to MS-DOS. Since MS-DOS had access to more memory (as few IBM PCs were sold with less than 64 KB of memory, while CP/M could run in 16 KB if necessary), more commands were built into the command-line shell, making MS-DOS somewhat faster and easier to use on floppy-based computers.|$|E
50|$|These hopes {{came to an}} {{end when}} the case was thrown out of court. During the initial {{proceedings}} it was learned that <b>dBASE's</b> file format and language had been based on a mainframe product used at JPL, where Ratliff had been working when he first created Vulcan. The credibility of Ratliff was jeopardized by his alternate claims of ownership while at Ashton Tate and then supporting the roots at JPL after he left. All the facts were never sorted out and Ashton-Tate's competitors had a self-interest motivated field day in writing amicus briefs.|$|R
40|$|We present multiresolution B-spline {{surfaces}} of arbitrary order defined over triangular domains. Unlike existing methods, {{the basic idea}} of our approach is to construct the triangular basis functions from their tensor product relatives {{in the spirit of}} box splines by projecting them onto the barycentric plane. The scheme works for splines of any order where the fundamental building blocks of the surface are hierarchies of triangular B-spline scaling functions and wavelets spanning the complement spaces between levels of different resolution.

Rev. <b>DBased</b> {{on the full}} BaBar data sample, we report improved measurements of the ratios R(D(*)) = B(B -> D(*) Tau Nu) /B(B -> D(*) l Nu), where l is either e or mu. These ratios are sensitive to new physics contributions {{in the form of}} a charged Higgs boson. We measure R(D) = 0. 440 +- 0. 058 +- 0. 042 and R(D*) = 0. 332 +- 0. 024 +- 0. 018, which exceed the Standard Model expectations by 2. 0 sigma and 2. 7 sigma, respectively. Taken together, our results disagree with these expectations at the 3. 4 sigma level. This excess cannot be explained by a charged Higgs boson in the type II two-Higgs-doublet model. Kinematic distributions presented here exclude large portions of the more general type III two-Higgs-doublet model, but there are solutions within this model compatible with the results...|$|R
25|$|WordStar, one of {{the first}} widely used word processors, and <b>dBASE,</b> an early and popular {{database}} program for small computers, were originally written for CP/M. Two early outliners, KAMAS (Knowledge and Mind Amplification System) and its cut-down successor Out-Think (without programming facilities and retooled for 8080/V20 compatibility) were also written for CP/M, though later rewritten for MS-DOS. Turbo Pascal, the ancestor of Borland Delphi, and Multiplan, the ancestor of Microsoft Excel, also debuted on CP/M before MS-DOS versions became available. Visicalc, the first-ever spreadsheet program, was made available for CP/M. Another company, Sorcim, created its Supercalc spreadsheet for CP/M, which would go on to become the market leader and de facto standard on CP/M. Supercalc would go on to be a competitor in the spreadsheet market in the MS-DOS world. AutoCAD, a CAD application from Autodesk debuted on CP/M. A host of compilers and interpreters for popular programming languages of the time (such as BASIC, Borland's Turbo Pascal and FORTRAN) were available, among them several of the earliest Microsoft products.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the biggest}} {{stumbling}} block was thatdespite being a fully compliant MS-DOS systemit was not {{compatible with the}} IBM PC at the hardware level. This was a problem because MS-DOS was rarely used as {{anything more than a}} simple program loader; complex software (spreadsheets, Flight Simulator, etc.) could only obtain acceptable performance by direct manipulation of the hardware. Wang used a 16-bit data bus instead of the 8-bit data bus used by IBM, arguing that applications would run much faster since most operations required I/O (disk, screen, keyboard, printer). With this 16-bit design, Wang used peripheral hardware devices, such as the Wang PC display adapter, that were not compatible with their counterparts in the IBM PC line. This meant that the vast library of software available for the IBM PC could not be directly run on the Wang PC. Only those programs that were either written specifically for the Wang PC or ported from the IBM PC were available. A basic word processing package developed by Wang and Microsoft's Multiplan spreadsheet were the two commonly marketed software products. Lotus 1-2-3 and <b>dBase</b> II were also available. This dearth of application software led to the early demise of the original Wang PC, and it was replaced by an Intel 80286 based product that was fully plug compatible with the IBM PC. The unique system software was available at extra cost.|$|E
500|$|PerForm and FormFlow were {{designed}} to allow users to create self-contained form applications which could be passed {{back and forth across}} a network. Both PerForm and FormFlow consisted of two distinct parts: [...] "Designer", which created the form application, and [...] "Filler", so users could submit the forms either by fax or, later, e-mail. The program could ease repetitive fill tasks, include mandatory fields, and use an input mask to accept only data entered in a valid format. The information could be saved and restored in a <b>dBase</b> file that used a Public-key cryptography system to encrypt the data running from client to server.|$|E
40|$|See {{paper for}} full list of authors - {{submitted}} to Phys. Rev. <b>DBased</b> {{on the full}} BaBar data sample of 466. 5 million BBbar pairs, we present measurements of the electron spectrum from semileptonic B meson decays. We fit the inclusive electron spectrum to distinguish CKM suppressed B -> Xu e nu decays from the CKM favored B -> Xc e nu decays, and from various other backgrounds, and determine the total semileptonic branching fraction BR(B -> X e nu) = (10. 34 +- 0. 04 _stat +- 0. 26 _syst) %, averaged over B+- and B 0 mesons. We determine the spectrum and branching fraction for charmless B -> Xu e nu decays and extract the CKM element |Vub|, by relying on four different QCD calculations based on the Heavy Quark Expansion. While experimentally, the electron momentum region above 2. 1 GeV/c is favored, because the background is relatively low, the uncertainties for the theoretical predictions are largest in the region near the kinematic endpoint. Detailed studies {{to assess the impact}} of these four predictions on the measurements of the electron spectrum, the branching fraction, and the extraction of the CKM matrix element |Vub| are presented, with the lower limit on the electron momentum varied from 0. 8 GeV/c to the kinematic endpoint. We determine |Vub| using each of these different calculations and find, |Vub| = (3. 794 +- 0. 107 _exp + 0. 292 - 0. 219 _SF + 0. 078 - 0. 068 _theory) * 10 ^{- 3 } (DN), (4. 563 +- 0. 126 _exp + 0. 230 - 0. 208 _SF + 0. 162 - 0. 163 _theory) * 10 ^{- 3 } (BLNP), (3. 959 +- 0. 104 _exp + 0. 164 - 0. 154 _SF + 0. 042 - 0. 079 _theory) * 10 ^{- 3 } (GGOU), (3. 848 +- 0. 108 _exp + 0. 084 - 0. 070 _theory) * 10 ^{- 3 } (DGE), where the stated uncertainties refer to the experimental uncertainties of the partial branching fraction measurement, the shape function parameters, and the theoretical calculations...|$|R

2500|$|Although Btrieve {{was fairly}} popular, {{it was an}} API {{database}} engine. The killer-app database manager on the PC, <b>dBase</b> II and its successors, were database management systems (DBMS) {{which could be used}} either as a free-standing, general-purpose application, or a database programming language. Btrieve was also more expensive than <b>dBase,</b> although run-time licensing was free of charge. Btrieve grew to a developer base of over 5,000 users and was widely used in the financial area.

Unlike the later ODBC, Blueprint was a purely code-based system, lacking anything approximating a command language like SQL. Instead, programmers used data structures to store the query information, constructing a query by linking many of these structures together. Lotus referred to these compound structures as query trees.|$|E
2500|$|Other early word-processing {{software}} required users to memorize semi-mnemonic key combinations rather than pressing keys labelled [...] "copy" [...] or [...] "bold". (In fact, many early PCs lacked cursor keys; WordStar famously used the E-S-D-X-centered [...] "diamond" [...] for cursor navigation, and modern vi-like editors encourage use of hjkl for navigation.) However, the price differences between dedicated word processors and general-purpose PCs, {{and the value}} added to the latter by software such as VisiCalc, were so compelling that personal computers and word processing software soon became serious competition for the dedicated machines. Word processing became the most popular use for personal computers, and unlike the spreadsheet (dominated by Lotus 1-2-3) and database (<b>dBase)</b> markets, WordPerfect, XyWrite, Microsoft Word, , {{and dozens of other}} word processing software brands competed in the 1980s; PC Magazine reviewed 57 different programs in one January 1986 issue.

It was one of the first database products that ran on a microcomputer, and its programming environment (the <b>dBASE</b> language) allowed it to be used to build a wide variety of custom applications. Although microcomputers had limited memory and storage at the time, <b>dBASE</b> nevertheless allowed a huge number of small-to-medium-sized tasks to be automated. The value-added resellers (VARs) who developed applications using <b>dBASE</b> became an important early sales channel for <b>dBASE.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Borland merger was not {{a smooth}} one.

Borland was also developing a competitor product called The Borland <b>dBase</b> Compiler for Windows. This product was designed by Gregor Freund who led a small team developing this fast, object-oriented version of <b>dBASE.</b> It was when Borland showed the product to the Ashton-Tate team that they finally conceded that they had lost the battle for <b>dBASE.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1989, Microtrend Books {{published}} the first [...] "Xbase" [...] cross-reference book (before {{the term was}} coined), The <b>dBASE</b> Language Handbook, by David M.

At more than 1,000 pages, it compared the execution of commands and functions to enable developers to build and maintain portable applications.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>dBASE</b> II was ported to the IBM PC (i.e. the MS-DOS {{operating}} system) {{and shipped}} in September 1982. Pawluk ran advertisements promoting <b>dBASE</b> II for the IBM PC for months before it shipped. When <b>dBASE</b> II for the IBM PC shipped, {{it was one}} of few major applications available on the PC, and that fact, combined with good promotion and sales in the US and internationally, caused <b>dBASE</b> II sales to grow rapidly. Turner expanded Aston-Tate's international distribution efforts and encouraged exclusive distributors in major markets to translate <b>dBASE</b> II from English to non-English versions. The early presence of <b>dBASE</b> II in international markets, as IBM rolled out the PC in those markets, facilitated rapid growth in sales and market share for <b>dBASE.</b> At one point in 1983, the company's French distributor [...] "La Command Electronique" [...] (whose owner was Hughes LeBlanc) claimed that [...] "one in ten buyers of a PC in France is buying <b>dBASE</b> II." ...|$|E

50|$|FoxPro {{was derived}} from FoxBase (Fox Software, Perrysburg, Ohio), which was in turn derived from <b>dBase</b> III (Ashton Tate) and <b>dBase</b> II. <b>dBase</b> II was the first {{commercial}} version of a database program written by Wayne Ratliff, called Vulcan, running on CP/M.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, {{the newly}} formed <b>dBase</b> LLC opted to support this install base of <b>dBASE</b> {{applications}} by releasing a virtualization tool named dbDOS.

With enhanced support for <b>dBASE</b> III, <b>dBASE</b> IV (Version 1, 2, 3), and <b>dBASE</b> V for DOS, dbDOS is the easiest way to keep mission critical applications up and running for years to come.|$|E
50|$|To {{make matters}} worse, while the <b>dBASE</b> for DOS clone (FoxBase) copied <b>dBASE</b> closely, the Windows {{version of this}} product was {{developed}} without an existing <b>dBASE</b> for Windows model. One of <b>dBASE</b> for DOS's strengths was multi-vendor support and this {{was lost in the}} various Windows xBase products. Borland's Visual <b>dBASE</b> for Windows couldn't run Microsoft's Foxbase for Windows programs and vice versa. Faced with a fragmented market and the need to rewrite programs to take advantage of Windows, there was little incentive for xBase users to stay loyal to the product they'd used for DOS.|$|E
5000|$|... xBase is {{the generic}} term for all {{programming}} languages {{that derive from}} the original <b>dBASE</b> (Ashton-Tate) programming language and database formats.

5000|$|One {{particularly}} important {{addition to the}} lineup of third-party add-ons was the eventual release of <b>dBASE</b> compilers, which would take a <b>dBASE</b> project and compile it and link it into a stand-alone runnable program.

These compilers essentially replaced Ashton-Tate's own solution to this problem, a $395 per-machine [...] "runtime" [...] copy of <b>dBASE,</b> and thereby removed one source of A-T's income. The granddaddy of the compilers was Clipper, from Nantucket Software. Eventually a number of these were developed into full-blown <b>dBASE</b> clones.|$|E
