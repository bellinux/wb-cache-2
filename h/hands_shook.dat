2500|$|Among {{her last}} radio {{appearances}} {{was in an}} episode of the BBC's Desert Island Discs with Roy Plomley. Bankhead, at 62 and audibly suffering from breathing difficulties from emphysema in the interview show, frankly spoke of how hopeless she would be on a desert island, admitting that she [...] "couldn’t put a key in the door, dahling. I can't do a thing for myself." [...] In the interview, host Plomley spoke of Bankhead's glory days as the most celebrated actress of 1920s London. Later he recalled of their interview, [...] "She was a very frail and ailing old lady, and I {{was shocked to see}} how old and ill she looked as I helped her out of a taxi. She had come from her hotel wearing a mink coat slung over a pair of lounging pyjamas, and she leaned heavily on my arm as I supported her to the lift. Her eyes were still fine, and there was still beauty in the bone structure of her face beneath the wrinkles and ravages of hard living. Her <b>hands</b> <b>shook,</b> and when she wished to go to the loo she had to ask Monica Chapman to accompany her to help her with her clothing." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} the design, modeling, and optimization of an electromagnetic energy harvesting (EMEH) device with various tube length and winding coil width. The nonlinear magnetic-spring configuration is employed for gen-erating sufficient power from <b>hand</b> <b>shaking</b> of irregular and low-frequency vibrations. Based on the modeling and simulation, longer tube {{length of the}} EMEH device results in lower resonant frequency and stronger nonlinearity {{of the system and}} thus is more efficient for low-frequency harvesting. From the <b>hand</b> <b>shaking</b> test, it is found that a longer tube length and a shorter winding coil width could induce a higher power generation. The optimized device of tube length of 66 mm and winding coil width of 10 mm has achieved maximum power outputs of 568. 66 µW at the <b>hand</b> <b>shaking</b> acceleration of 1 g and frequency of 6. 7 Hz, which corresponds to the power density of 90. 67 µW/cm 3. Further improvement of the device has been achieved by increasing the coil length to 40 m. This device provides maximum power outputs of 825. 36 µW at the <b>hand</b> <b>shaking</b> acceleration of 1. 56 g and frequency of 6. 7 Hz. This paper demonstrates a feasible design of nonlinear EMEH device with impressive output performance from <b>hand</b> <b>shaking.</b> Index Terms — Electromagnetic energy harvester (EMEH), nonlinear, magnetic-spring, <b>hand</b> <b>shaking...</b>|$|R
