50|$|Transparent {{conductive}} coatings {{are used}} in applications where {{it is important that}} the coating conduct electricity or dissipate static charge. Conductive coatings are used to protect the aperture from electromagnetic Interference, while dissipative coatings are used to prevent the build-up of static electricity. Transparent conductive coatings are also used extensively to provide electrodes in situations where light is required to pass, for example in flat panel display technologies and in many photoelectrochemical experiments. A common substance used in transparent conductive coatings is indium tin oxide (ITO). ITO is not very optically transparent, however. The layers must be thin to provide substantial transparency, particularly at the blue end of the spectrum. Using ITO, sheet resistances of 20 to 10,000 ohms per square can be achieved. An ITO coating may be combined with an antireflective coating to further improve transmittance. Other TCOs (Transparent Conductive Oxides) include AZO (Aluminium doped Zinc Oxide), which offers much better UV transmission than ITO.A special class of transparent conductive coatings applies to infrared films for theater-air military optics where IR transparent windows need to have (Radar) stealth (Stealth technology) properties. These are known as RAITs (Radar Attenuating / Infrared Transmitting) and include materials such as boron <b>doped</b> <b>DLC</b> (Diamond-like carbon).|$|E

40|$|Diamondlike-carbon (DLC) {{coatings}} {{have received}} a lot of research attention by physicists and engineers, especially in the past 25 years. Attempts to use such materials in tribological applications have achieved variable success. The rationale for this work was to investigate the wear durability of three types of DLC coatings applied to hardened and tempered bearing steel and subject them to realistic high pressure cyclic loading under oil lubricated conditions for long duration. A thrust bearing design was deployed for this purpose. The wear and friction behavior of the DLC coated materials relative to uncoated materials was compared when using base (additive free) oils and typical autoengine formulated oils. The type of oil used made no difference to the dynamic friction and oil temperature for all the material and oil combinations used. Durability of the coated and uncoated roller bearings was determined by the type of material. For the uncoated bearings, life was limited after very many test cycles (approaching a billion) via classical rolling contact fatigue pitting. For all the DLC coated rollers life was governed by wear of their coatings. In the case of the tungsten <b>doped</b> <b>DLCs</b> (a-C:H:W), these were worn progressively and uniformly via microabrasion, whereas the nondoped ta-C and a-C DLC coatings were principally worn via delamination and tearing. The latter effect was relatively rapid and was considered to be initiated by blistering of the coating, a process that was probably driven by the high elastic energy/internal stress within the nondoped coating materials. The durability to delamination and tearing of the ta-C coatings was slightly lowered in formulated oil compared to tests made in base oil. Overall, for the test conditions used here, there was no apparent benefit in using DLC coatings...|$|R

DLC coatings have the potential to reduce the required level of many traditional oil additives that can negatively impact on both the environment and certain parts of the car engine, specifically the catalytic converter. Furthermore DLC shows promise with regards to reducing friction and can be highly efficacious at reducing wear. The field of research into DLC is ever-developing and many examples of <b>doped</b> <b>DLCs</b> exist. Currently, there is no firm consensus on which dopants are best to include in the DLC matrix when it is being employed within the automotive field. Adding to this the lack of a sufficient understanding of how current engine oil additives interact with DLC; the motivation for undertaking an in-depth analysis of both a-C:H and Si-DLC with current engine oils is clear. This thesis addresses these issues and presents evidence on how both Si-DLCs and a-C:H DLCs interact with current engine oil additives to reduce wear in the engine.

40|$|In {{the past}} decade the range of {{possible}} applications for diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings has changed significantly: from their conventional use in low-stress applications without lubricants, to their use in high-stress applications under lubricated conditions. Despite this progress, {{there is still a}} lack of understanding of the lubrication mechanisms involving DLC coatings. Our idea for improving the boundary lubrication of DLC coatings is to dope them with various elements, thus making the coatings more "surface-active", in order that they behave in a similar way to conventional metal-lubrication mechanisms. Accordingly, in this paper we present and compare the tribological performance of self-mated (DLC/DLC) non-doped and doped Ti-, W-, and Si-DLC coatings, lubricated with paraffinic mineral oil and using conventional anti-wear (AW) and extreme-pressure (EP) additives. For a comparison, conventional steel/steel contacts were also investigated.

Up to one order of magnitude less wear, as a result of using additives, suggests that efficient boundary lubrication with <b>doped</b> and non-doped <b>DLC</b> coatings can also be achieved and/or improved in self-mated DLC/DLC contacts by using conventional AW and EP additives. The coefficient of friction in DLC contacts increased with the use of additives, but it was always lower than that of steel contacts, thus maintaining the "reputation" of DLC contacts as low-friction coatings. status: publishe...|$|R

Minimum field emission thresholds occur at P:C ratios of around 0. 02, and voltage bias values ~ 30 % lower than that for the undoped film. Annealing in vacuum at 150 °C can improve the field emission threshold of the low P content films by a factor of four. © 2000 Elsevier Science S. A. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{developed}} a novel method of synthesizing metal-doped diamond-like carbon films (DLC) using the cathodic are evaporation (CAE) process. Intense Cr plasma energy activated the decomposition of hydrocarbon source gas C 2 H 2 to form a metal-doped amorphous carbon film on steel substrates. We deposited a Cr interlayer to prevent interdiffusion between DLC and the steel substrates. When the C 2 H 2 partial pressure is higher than 1. 3 Pa, the deposition reaction switched from Cr 3 C 2 to DLC formation. The result is a hydrogenated DLC thin film possessing excellent microhardness as high as 3824 Hv(25 g), and for which the incorporation of a Cr interface and Cr <b>doping</b> in the <b>DLC</b> matrix ensure film ductility and sufficient film adhesion. We employed Raman spectroscopy to evaluate the influences of reactive gas flow and substrate bias on the DLC composition; we carried out the microstructure and mechanical property measurements by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), glow discharge optical spectroscopy (GDS) and wear tests.

40|$|Abstract: Silicon {{incorporated}} {{diamond like carbon}} (Si-DLC) {{films were}} deposited via DC plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, at substrate temperature 300 oC. The precursor gas used was acetylene and Si incorporation was achieved by sending tetraethyl orthosilicate dissolved in methanol into the plasma chamber during deposition. Si concentration in the films was varied from 0 % to 19. 31 % as measured from energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). The binding energies of C 1 s, Si 2 s and Si 2 p were determined from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies. Surface morphology of the Si-DLC films studied by an atomic force microscope. We have observed low-macroscopic field electron emission from Si-DLC thin films deposited on glass substrates. The emission properties have been studied for a fixed anode-sample separation of 80 μm for different Si concentrations in the films. The turn-on field was also found to vary from 16. 19 to 3. 61 V/μm. Approximate calculated effective work function lies in the range 0. 065 eV to 0. 016 eV. It {{was found that the}} turn-on field and effective emission barrier were reduced by Si <b>doping</b> than undoped <b>DLC...</b>|$|R
