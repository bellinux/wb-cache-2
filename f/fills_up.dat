5|$|Dr. Mario {{offers a}} {{multiplayer}} gaming mode {{in which two}} players compete {{against each other in}} separate playing fields. In this mode, the player's goal is to clear their own playing field of viruses before the other player does. Eliminating multiple viruses or initiating chain reactions can cause additional capsules to fall onto the opponent's playing field. A player wins a single game upon eliminating all the viruses or if the other playing field <b>fills</b> <b>up.</b> The first player to win three games wins overall.|$|E
5|$|After Groundskeeper Willie {{takes away}} Bart's {{skateboard}} for destroying his leaf pile, Bart <b>fills</b> <b>up</b> Willie's shack with creamed corn {{as he is}} sleeping, destroying it. As Willie is taken away for medical attention, he swears revenge on Bart. Meanwhile, Krusty the Clown's show comes under criticism by the Federal Communications Commission for not being educational enough for children. The Channel 6 executive proposes that Krusty cut ten minutes from his three-hour show {{to make room for}} a kids' news program, Kidz News, where children deliver and report news items. Lisa is recruited as a news anchor along with other Springfield Elementary School children. Bart is not chosen at first, but is made sportscaster after he complains to Marge.|$|E
5|$|While a grind, lip, or manual {{trick is}} underway, a balance meter appears: unless the player {{prevents}} this meter from {{falling to the}} left or right, the character will bail and need a few seconds to recover. Bailing can also be caused by falling without one's board facing downward. Completing tricks in succession without bailing is called a combo. Comboing raises the player's score and <b>fills</b> <b>up</b> the Special Meter; when it is full, the player is granted access to more elaborate tricks worth more points, such as the McTwist and 540 Flip. Underground introduces the ability to dismount one's skateboard, which allows the player to explore levels more carefully and reach new areas. Each level features at least one vehicle, usually a car, that the player can drive.|$|E

This led to fast tissues and slow tissues concept, where some tissues <b>fill</b> <b>up</b> with gas and empty it out rapidly; {{these are the}} fast tissues. On the other hand, slow tissues are slow <b>filling</b> <b>up</b> and slow emptying out. Haldane portrayed the logarithmic trend of these tissues to <b>fill</b> <b>up</b> and empty out.|$|R

25|$|Costs of {{emptying}} {{septic tanks}}. The cost of emptying septic tanks can be significant. Some people avoid using their septic tanks, {{because if they}} do the tank <b>fills</b> <b>up</b> more quickly and they must pay to empty it more often. They thus continue to pollute the surrounding environment, although they have sanitation facilities at home.|$|E
25|$|But topological {{dimension}} {{is a very}} crude measure of the local size of a space (size near a point). A curve that is almost space-filling can still have topological dimension one, even if it <b>fills</b> <b>up</b> most of the area of a region. A fractal has an integer topological dimension, {{but in terms of}} the amount of space it takes up, it behaves like a higher-dimensional space.|$|E

25|$|The pit or trench can be dug {{large enough}} so that the pit {{can be used for}} many years before it <b>fills</b> <b>up.</b> When the pit becomes full, it may be emptied or the hole covered with earth and the pit latrine relocated. Pit latrines have to be located away from {{drinking}} water sources (wells, streams, etc.) to minimize the possibility of disease spread via groundwater pollution.|$|E
25|$|Netanya {{itself is}} divided into {{a large number of}} neighborhoods (see Neighborhoods of Netanya), {{recently}} growing southwards out of the city to create a number of high-end coastal neighborhoods with industrial areas inland. Netanya is home to the Poleg nature reserve and the Irises Dora Rainpool nature park containing the world's largest population of iris atropurpurea. At the center of the park is a rainpool which <b>fills</b> <b>up</b> with water in the winter months, and dries up over the summer months. Signs along the rainpool include information on the types of flora and fauna which populate the ecosystem.|$|E
25|$|The {{intuitive}} {{concept of}} dimension of a geometric object X {{is the number}} of independent parameters one needs to pick out a unique point inside. However, any point specified by two parameters can be instead specified by one, because the cardinality of the real plane is equal to the cardinality of the real line (this can be seen by an argument involving interweaving the digits of two numbers to yield a single number encoding the same information). The example of a space-filling curve shows that one can even take one real number into two both surjectively (so all pairs of numbers are covered) and continuously, so that a one-dimensional object completely <b>fills</b> <b>up</b> a higher-dimensional object.|$|E

25|$|Armies {{are led by}} Commanding Officers {{who control}} units. All COs except Andy provide units with special {{advantages}} and disadvantages, such as extra firepower, greater strength, or a shorter firing range, with some COs being better with some units than others (i.e. being better with air units, than naval units). COs also have a Power Meter which <b>fills</b> <b>up</b> by defeating enemy units or when {{on the receiving end}} of a brutal offensive attack. When the meter is full, a CO can unleash their CO Power, which gives a temporary positive effect to friendly units and/or a negative effect to enemy units. For example, Nell gives a Critical Strike bonus and Olaf makes it snow, disadvantaging his opponent.|$|E
25|$|The {{display on}} a net sounder shows the {{distance}} of the net from the bottom (or the surface), rather than the depth of water as with the echo-sounder's hull-mounted transducer. Fixed to the headline of the net, the footrope can usually be seen which gives an indication of the net performance. Any fish passing into the net can also be seen, allowing fine adjustments to be made to catch the most fish possible. In other fisheries, where the amount of fish in the net is important, catch sensor transducers are mounted at various positions on the cod-end of the net. As the cod-end <b>fills</b> <b>up</b> these catch sensor transducers are triggered one by one and this information is transmitted acoustically to display monitors on the bridge of the vessel. The skipper can then decide when to haul the net.|$|E
25|$|Double-vault UDDTs are {{alternatively}} called twin-vault, two-vault or two-chambered UDDTs. In double-vault UDDTs, the fecal material dehydrates in situ. The two above-ground vaults {{are used}} alternately. While one vault is filling up, the other (full) one stores the fecal material under dry conditions {{for at least}} six months. During this resting period, no fresh feces are allowed to enter the full vault. In order to switch from one vault to the other, the user interface can either be switched or both vaults can be equipped with fixed seats and a cover sufficient to prevent access to the full vault. When the second vault becomes full and at least 6 months have passed, the first vault is emptied with a shovel and then the user interface is moved over accordingly. The vaults are commonly sized so that one vault <b>fills</b> <b>up</b> in six to 12 months.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the powered-up versions of Special Moves introduced in previous Street Fighter games such as Super Combos and EX Special Moves, the game also introduces {{a new type of}} powered-up Special Move officially dubbed the Ultra Combo. Ultra Combos are long and cinematic moves featuring a lengthy combination of punches, kicks and other fighting techniques. Just as there is a Super Combo gauge, there is also an Ultra Combo gauge (officially known as the Revenge Gauge or Revenge Meter), but whereas the Super Combo gauge <b>fills</b> <b>up</b> when the player hits their opponent or performs a Special Move, the Revenge Gauge fills when one takes damage from their opponent (similar to the K Groove featured in Capcom vs. SNK 2). Along with the Super Combos, Ultra Combos are one of the only times (besides Zangief, E. Honda, Seth and Abel's command throws) the camera breaks from its normal fixed position to show a more dynamic, cinematic view of the gameplay.|$|E
25|$|A {{major part}} of The Godfather IIs {{gameplay}} is extorting businesses. When the player is attempting to intimidate a business owner into paying protection money, a meter appears on screen with two red bars. To get the owner to agree to pay, the player must intimidate them until the meter <b>fills</b> <b>up</b> to the first bar. After this point, the more intimidation the player can achieve, the more money the owner will pay out. However, if the meter passes the second red bar, the owner will begin to fight back and will refuse to pay anything. Every business owner has a weak point, something they particularly fear, and if the player finds it, {{the amount of money}} paid out will rise faster than the meter fills, allowing the player to extort more money before the meter reaches the second red bar. Intimidation methods include beating the owner up, throwing them around, smashing their shop, hanging them off ledges, attacking customers, or pointing firearms at them.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{completion}} of feeding, the mosquito will withdraw her proboscis, {{and as the}} gut <b>fills</b> <b>up,</b> the stomach lining secretes a peritrophic membrane that surrounds the blood. This membrane keeps the blood separate from {{anything else in the}} stomach. However, like certain other insects that survive on dilute, purely liquid diets, notably many of the Hemiptera, many adult mosquitoes must excrete unwanted aqueous fractions even as they feed. (See the photograph of a feeding Anopheles stephensi: Note that the excreted droplet patently is not whole blood, being far more dilute). As long as they are not disturbed, this permits mosquitoes to continue feeding until they have accumulated a full meal of nutrient solids. As a result, a mosquito replete with blood can continue to absorb sugar, even as the blood meal is slowly digested {{over a period of several}} days. Once blood is in the stomach, the midgut of the female synthesizes proteolytic enzymes that hydrolyze the blood proteins into free amino acids. These are used as building blocks for the synthesis of egg yolk proteins.|$|E

25|$|A {{major part}} of The Godfathers {{gameplay}} is extorting businesses. The player must extort business to earn enough respect to level up, to complete certain missions, and to earn money. When the player is attempting to intimidate a business owner into paying protection money, a meter appears on screen with a green bar and a red bar. To get the owner to agree to pay, the player must intimidate them until the meter <b>fills</b> <b>up</b> to the green bar. After this point, the more intimidation the player can achieve, the more money the owner will pay out. However, if the meter passes the red bar, the owner will begin to fight back and will refuse to pay anything. Every business owner has a weak point, something they particularly fear, and if the player finds it, {{the amount of money}} paid out will rise faster than the meter fills, allowing the player to extort more money before the meter reaches the red zone. Intimidation methods include beating the owner up, throwing them around, smashing their shop, attacking customers, or pointing firearms at them. In the Xbox 360, Wii and PlayStation 3 versions of the game, the player will occasionally have the option of carrying out a favor for a business owner rather than intimidating them. This can involve carrying out a hit on someone, scaring someone, or going to a particular location at a particular time. If the player chooses to perform the favor, the amount of protection money paid by the owner will be maximized.|$|E
25|$|The {{next major}} {{revolution}} {{came in the}} mid-to-late 1990s, which saw the rise of 3D computer graphics and optical discs in fifth generation consoles. The implications for RPGs were enormous—longer, more involved quests, better audio, and full-motion video. This was clearly demonstrated in 1997 by the phenomenal success of Final Fantasy VII, which {{is considered one of}} the most influential games of all time, akin to that of Star Wars in the movie industry. With a record-breaking production budget of around $45 million, the ambitious scope of Final Fantasy VII raised the possibilities for the genre, with its more expansive world to explore, much longer quest, more numerous sidequests, dozens of minigames, and much higher production values. The latter includes innovations such as the use of 3D characters on pre-rendered backgrounds, battles viewed from multiple different angles rather than a single angle, and for the first time full-motion CGI video seamlessly blended into the gameplay, effectively integrated throughout the game. Gameplay innovations included the materia system, which allowed a considerable amount of customization and flexibility through materia that can be combined in many different ways and exchanged between characters at any time, and the limit breaks, special attacks that can be performed after a character's limit meter <b>fills</b> <b>up</b> by taking hits from opponents. The materia system is similar to, but more sophisticated than, the slotted item system in Diablo II (2000). Final Fantasy VII continues to be listed among the best games of all time, for its highly polished gameplay, high playability, lavish production, well-developed characters, intricate storyline, and an emotionally engaging narrative that is much darker and sophisticated than most other RPGs. The game's storytelling and character development was considered a major narrative jump forward for video games and was often compared to films and novels at the time.|$|E
500|$|As in {{the first}} two arcade games of the series, players have a power meter, located {{on the bottom of the}} screen. The meter <b>fills</b> <b>up</b> as the player lands punches against the opponent, and it goes down as the player gets hit. When the power meter <b>fills</b> <b>up</b> completely, the player will be able to launch {{knockout}} punches such as uppercuts, hooks, and rapid punches. These punches have a slight delay in execution, but they cause more damage to the opponent. Players can also build power as the match progresses, as indicated by the background color behind the player's face on the upper left corner of the screen, which goes from blue to green to yellow to red. The player reaches [...] "Power-Up" [...] status when the background color reaches red. During this status, the player's punch speed and power increase. They lose their Power-Up status if they are knocked down.|$|E
