These two distinct socio-cultural developments, as reflected in Tokarczuk 2 ̆ 7 s novel, expand the concept of a subversive household into a transnational dis/order that abolishes borders between domestic (national) and foreign structures: an increasing masculinization of the power structures (political arena and 2 ̆ 2 scientific 2 ̆ 2 practices) impacts the management of the social and the most private aspects of women 2 ̆ 7 s lives in post- 1989 Poland while the growing popularity of 2 ̆ 2 intellectual 2 ̆ 2 feminism, borrowed from U.

40|$|In one of {{the most}} {{substantive}} and visible diasporas of the late twentieth century, more than two million Vietnamese left their homeland {{after the end of the}} Vietnam War in 1975 and made new lives for themselves overseas. The majority resettled in the United States, Australia, Canada, and France, but Vietnamese communities were established in countries as diverse as Israel and Norway. Based on an oral history project conducted in Australia between 2005 and 2008, this article explores the narratives of four Vietnamese women who have intermarried with non-Vietnamese men. The contexts for these marriages range from Asia in the 1960 s to Australia in the 1990 s. The four women are differentiated in terms of generation, class, and level of education, but all are shaped by the history and legacy of their family and country. Their lives in Vietnam were conducted against a background of political unrest and war, and all have been subjected to displacement or migration, and experienced profound loss in the shape of the loss of homeland. The author explores the representation of cross-cultural relationships in Vietnamese literary culture before examining the women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>narratives</b> <b>in</b> detail and focusing on two central questions: firstly, what do their portrayals of cross-cultural marriage reveal about their relationship with the past and with memory?

40|$|This {{dissertation}} critically {{examined how}} Barack Obama discursively constructed his Africanity (African identity/descent) {{within the framework}} of the 2008 U. S. presidential election, and how a select group of six newspapers from three continents refracted or re-presented Obama 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>in</b> their coverage of his campaign. Two major theoretical frameworks underpin this study: framing and Afrocentricity. Framing analysis, an approach that allows researchers to account for frame packages, identity narratives, issue definitions, and major themes, served as the major methodological tool for this investigation. To critically analyze Obama 2 ̆ 7 s use of Africanity, this study focused on eight relevant speeches during the 2008 presidential campaign season, his books (Dreams from My Father and Audacity of Hope), and newspaper reports from six different countries. The media outlets studied for possible refraction and emergent frames included ThisDay (Nigeria), Daily Nation (Kenya), Al Ahram (Egypt), Mail 2 ̆ 6 Guardian (South Africa), The New York Times (United States), and The Times of London (Britain). Three Afrocentric themes emerged from an in-depth analysis of the selected speeches: American exceptionalism, African roots and memories of a father, and African value of community. The following themes were identified in Obama 2 ̆ 7 s two best sellers, Dreams from My Father and Audacity of Hope: Roots and memories of a father: distance and shame; Roots and memories of a father: negotiation, confusion and emptiness; African lineage: acceptance and Afrocentricity; and African values of community. Finally newspaper coverage refracted two themes from Obama 2 ̆ 7 s speeches and books: African roots, ancestry, and memories of a father; and Afrocentric values of community, with two additional subthemes of Africa outside the trope of crisis/redemption, and the old idea of Africa. Ultimately, the results generated demonstrate that Obama 2 ̆ 7 s speeches, books, and newspaper constructions contributed to the shaping of his identity during the 2008 U. S. presidential race. The Afrocentric themes present in Obama 2 ̆ 7 s books and speeches were largely refracted by newspaper coverage. Specifically, his Afrocentric themes based on the memory of father and his Kenyan roots, and his language on togetherness, community, and working collectively, run through his books and speeches. In essence these communicative materials laid the foundations for his run for political office and, perhaps more importantly, demonstrated the effectiveness of Obama 2 ̆ 7 s political messaging and skill as a politician. More than that, the re-presentation of then-candidate Obama 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> Afrocentric <b>narrative</b> <b>in</b> newspaper coverage across the board is profound because it represents a clear departure from the old primordial ways of covering Africa by representing the continent in a positive redemptive frame...|$|R

40|$|In her 1987 novel Beloved, Toni Morrison {{acknowledges}} {{and even}} borrows from Frederick Douglass 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> 1845 <b>Narrative,</b> {{but she also}} makes a resolute break from its rhetorical and political objectives. Historical differences between the audiences of Douglass and Morrison account for {{a large part of}} their contrasting styles, particularly in their treatment of slave song. Since Douglass composed his Narrative as a fugitive slave in the early 1840 s, he was aware of his principally white audience and also of his precarious task of presenting an attack not on white America, but on the institution of slavery itself. Douglass 2 ̆ 7 s judicious decision to report the bleakness of slavery with austerity of tone allows him to present this attack successfully. He relies heavily on factual evidence, rather than on the tremendously emotional slave songs, to present the most appalling scenes of brutality endured by the slaves <b>in</b> his <b>narrative.</b> Morrison 2 ̆ 7 s Beloved responds deliberately and exhaustively to the description of slave song that appears at the outset of Douglass 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> 1845 <b>Narrative.</b> The fact that Morrison is not inhibited by the pressing need to abolish slavery allows her to explore the specificity of the slave songs to a degree that Douglass simply could not risk in 1845. The essential goal of Douglass 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Narrative</b> <b>in</b> 1845 was to inform what William Lloyd Garrison dubbed a 2 ̆ 2 stubbornly incredulous 2 ̆ 2 white audience of slavery 2 ̆ 7 s politically sanctioned barbarity (40). Since Morrison is not inhibited by the socio-political exigencies taken on by Douglass, she is free to focus more on song as a point of access into the reverberating effects of slavery 2 ̆ 7 s horrors [...] the same horrors that Douglass relates to his readers with a conspicuous deficit of emotion. The project of Morrison 2 ̆ 7 s novel is to register and index the vital relationship between the 2 ̆ 2 personhood 2 ̆ 2 of African Americans and the specific songs of former slaves. This is to say that the original description of slave song in Douglass, looming in the background of Morrison 2 ̆ 7 s novel, shapes her handling of music and song, her insistence on its signal importance as an indicator of human status in Beloved...|$|R

40|$|Juan Benet 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>narrative</b> offers {{challenges}} that have often led critics to define {{his work as}} deeply enigmatic and experimental, and to enter with uncertainty into what Benet himself has termed 2 ̆ 2 the zone of shadows 2 ̆ 2 {{that lies at the}} heart of his writing. As a result, many critics have approached Benet 2 ̆ 7 s work from a formalist perspective, seeking to explain the techniques and structures that form the foundation of his enigmatic fictional worlds. In contrast, this study proposes a cultural analysis, rooted in history, that explores Benet 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>narrative</b> as a compelling site of memory (lieux de mémoire) of the Spanish Civil War. From such a perspective, Benet 2 ̆ 7 s work can be understood as a rewriting of the past within the frame of trauma, and therefore as a discourse that resists the mythical dimensions of the Civil War constructed by Francoist historiography with the purpose of making the past the private property of the State. ^ Through their revisiting of this traumatic site of memory, Benet 2 ̆ 7 s novels challenge hegemonic ideas of the nation by subverting historical myths of national identity. The <b>narrative</b> space <b>in</b> Benet 2 ̆ 7 s novels recasts a nation that acquires its meaning through a complex and enigmatic rewriting, and thus subverts the Francoist Regime 2 ̆ 7 s notion of a 2 ̆ 2 true 2 ̆ 2 and essential Spain that disallows diversity and difference. In addition, Benet 2 ̆ 7 s ambiguous, fragmented and polysemic nation belongs to a literary tradition that establishes the dysfunctional family as the principal allegory for national identity. ^ The study of the sites of memory related to time and nation in Benet 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>narrative</b> also underscores two crucial aspects related to gender and the national essence. First, Benet 2 ̆ 7 s texts restore women to a central position of subjectivity during the Civil War, thus rejecting the representation of women as the Other. Second, female characters are shown in Benet 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>narrative</b> to be uniquely situated to re-examine the national trauma associated with the war, thus transcending their assumed passive role and transforming its narration into an active, historical and defiant act against Francoist institutions. As a result, women become central figures of history in Benet 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>narrative.</b> ^ <b>In</b> brief, Benet creates sites of memory in his writing in which marginal and forgotten characters obtain an active role in the Spanish Civil War by articulating the traumatic history of the nation, and by challenging the mythic foundation upon which the Franco regime had legitimized its own place in history through exclusion of the voices of others. ...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{principal}} strands of postcolonial theory and critical practice is the interrogation of received versions of colonial history. This paper investigates {{the extent to which}} three contemporary picture books, Gavin Bishop 2 ̆ 7 s The House that Jack Built, John Marsden and Shaun Tan 2 ̆ 7 s The Rabbits, and Thomas King and William Kent Monkman 2 ̆ 7 s A Coyote Columbus Story, mobilise postcolonial strategies in their representations of place. In particular, it focuses on how postcolonial textuality unsettles and transgresses notions of "homeliness" <b>in</b> <b>narratives</b> involving the displacement of colonised and colonising peoples. As the shifting power relations of colonialism render unhomely what has previously been homely (especially for colonised peoples), so they involve a contrary move in which unhomely spaces are changed into simulacra of lost or abandoned homes. Drawing upon Walter Benjamin 2 ̆ 7 s formulation of materialist historiography, Homi Bhabha describes what he terms 2 ̆ 7 the unhomely moment 2 ̆ 7 as that in which personal and psychic histories intersect with the violent dislocations of colonialism. This paper will argue that such unhomely moments shape the visual and verbal narratives of The House that Jack Built, The Rabbits and A Coyote Columbus Story, all of which deal with the trauma which occurs when cultures previously geographically and psychically distant are brought into close contact with each other. Written to and for children who are citizens of postcolonial cultures, these texts disclose the unease which persists in contemporary societies where colonial histories are rehearsed and revisioned. However, the paper will argue that the three texts position readers in quite different ways; for instance, while the verbal text of The Rabbits constructs an implied author capable of speaking for the colonised and offering readers a very circumscribed subject position, Thomas King 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>narrative</b> <b>in</b> A Coyote Columbus Story engages in a dialogic playfulness which allows readers to adopt a variety of reading positions. For each text, some key representations of unhomely moments will be considered, and the paper will explore {{the extent to which they}} construct forms of temporality which negotiate the space between history and its significances within crosscultural and intercultural formations. <br /...|$|R

The study included 18 children from a private Montessori school in the northeast. The kindergartners worked in three separate small groups of six. Each group took part in 9 sessions.

According to Rodgers 2 ̆ 7 s historiographical chronology, the twentieth century has witnessed three conceptual paradigms: the 2 ̆ 2 Beardian 2 ̆ 2 / 2 ̆ 2 progressive 2 ̆ 2 paradigm, dominant throughout the 1940 s, which portrayed history as an unending series of conflicts among antagonistic 2 ̆ 2 classes, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 groups, 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 interests 2 ̆ 2; the 2 ̆ 2 Hartzian 2 ̆ 2 / 2 ̆ 2 liberal 2 ̆ 2 paradigm, emphasizing the consensual values that defined America as a civilization and profoundly limited the course and pace of cultural change, predominating from the early 1950 s through the late 1960 s; and the 2 ̆ 2 republican 2 ̆ 2 paradigm, which Rodgers seeks to characterize in far greater detail, emerging in the late sixties and 2 ̆ 2 perceptibly thinning out 2 ̆ 2 by 1990.

Abstraction here means a particular type of filmic presentation and it is the employment of abstraction as an already determined form of film construction. This presentation and what allows the film to be abstract is the confrontation with the conventions of abstraction.

40|$|My title {{suggests}} a rather straightforward enterprise: I want {{to account for}} the enormous popularity of the Gothic - both novels and films - since the Second World War. However, the title proposes more questions than it answers. First, what exactly counts as “the contemporary Gothic”? Since its inception in 1764, with Horace Walpole 2 ̆ 7 s The Castle of Otranto, the Gothic has always played with chronology, looking back to moments in an imaginary history, pining for a social stability that never existed, mourning a chivalry that belonged more to the fairy tale than to reality. And contemporary Gothic does not break with this tradition: Stephen King 2 ̆ 7 s IT (1987) and Anne Rice 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> vampire <b>narratives</b> (begun <b>in</b> the 1970 s) weave {{in and out of the}} distant past in order to comment on the state of contemporary American culture, while other narratives foreground their reliance on prior, historically distant narratives...|$|R

40|$|Use of the <b>narrative</b> form <b>in</b> law {{and legal}} {{analysis}} remains controversial. Advocates such as Derrick Bell, Richard Delgado, and Kathryn Abrams {{have argued that}} <b>narrative</b> <b>in</b> law can elicit particular perspectives and experiences that are reduced or bleached away when incorporated into the formalisms of pure doctrinal studies. By contrast, critics such as Daniel Farber and Suzanna Sherry maintain that narratives can distort {{if they are not}} sufficiently based on empirical fact or reason. Narratives, they claim, must be evaluated on the basis of objective standards. The Article transcends this divide. In particular, it argues that the valuable functions of legal <b>narrative</b> <b>in</b> law and legal scholarship become visible when their literary character is examined. The Article undertakes this analysis by a close study of the narratives of Derrick Bell. The Article maintains that Bell 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>narratives</b> should be read as parables. Parables function literarily by a process of disorientation that at once upsets traditional norms and opens the way for reorientation to occur. The Article therefore defends the deployment of legal narrative and concludes that its critics are guilty of a category mistake. They too frequently analyze legal narratives on the basis of traditional norms, when the very function of narrative is to manifest new norms and new understandings...|$|R
