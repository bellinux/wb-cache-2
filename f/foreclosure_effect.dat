Adapting the first-order condition approach of static oligopoly games {{to the analysis of}} vertically related oligopolies, we develop a novel framework for directly evaluating the strategic <b>foreclosure</b> <b>effect</b> and the effciency benefits associated with vertical integration.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} foreclosures on residential income segregation and identifies appropriate policies which can contribute to less segregated communities {{in the context of}} the recent subprime mortgage foreclosure crisis. It is based on the theoretical framework that foreclosures play a role in structuring geographical distribution of residents, specifically by income, because low- and median-income households, who are primary targets of high-risk subprime lending, are the most vulnerable groups for these foreclosures. Using the threshold effect theory, this study hypothesizes that foreclosures, especially when they are concentrated in economically distressed neighborhoods, can exacerbate income segregation, and at a certain point, the <b>foreclosure</b> <b>effect</b> will grow rapidly when more homes are entering foreclosure in a neighborhood. To determine what impact the <b>foreclosure</b> <b>effect</b> will have and how it varies due to different neighborhood characteristics, an empirical analysis is applied, targeted at the Miami Metropolitan Area. This area was chosen due to the significant number of foreclosures that occurred during the recent recession. The results of the analysis show that the concentrated foreclosures have an effect on income segregation; the more the foreclosure activities are generated, the deeper the income segregation is. However, though this study assumes that higher-income neighborhoods might be able to manage the foreclosure problem without significant changes during the early stages, the spline regression, conducted by neighborhood type, reveals a different pattern. In fact, the segregated pattern of low-income households triggered by foreclosures is more rapid and distinct in the Economically Strong neighborhoods; out-migration of high-income households is more likely to occur. In addition, the <b>foreclosure</b> <b>effect</b> is also significant in the Moderate and Economically Distressed neighborhoods, while the initial pace of segregation is slower than in the Economically Strong neighborhoods. The results imply that programs that mitigate the <b>foreclosure</b> <b>effect</b> should be applied as soon as possible in all three types of neighborhoods, and different policy directions are needed for different neighborhood types. The Economically Strong neighborhoods will need programs to impede outflows of higher-income households, and the Moderate and Economically Distressed neighborhoods should focus on preventing further delinquency and foreclosures and potential property abandonment...|$|E

Although neighborhood stability has long been considered a substantial determinant of crime, foreclosures have not been the subject of concerted research among criminologists until recently. A number of recent studies have examined the linkage between home foreclosures and crime.

This variation led us to examine the spatial extent to which foreclosures affect a relatively small surrounding area. In this paper, we consider the spatial extent of the <b>foreclosure</b> <b>effect</b> on crime by estimating fixed effect negative binomial models using geocoded UCR data for 2003 – 2008 and foreclosure data to predict crime counts using the number of foreclosures within various small area radii.

The findings of this paper are as follows: When the bundling firm produces the high-quality competing product, bundling will reduce the consumer surplus while may increase the competitor's profit and social welfare.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to explain if the <b>foreclosure</b> <b>effect</b> on prices is {{explained}} by a lower quality of foreclosed houses, which is a crucial aspect in the intelligibility of foreclosures. Based on a novel and comprehensive dataset, we estimate the impact of foreclosure on home prices in Florida and Indiana from 2000 to 2008. We employ a model of housing demand, which enables us to flexibly estimate (unobserved) quality as a house-specific fixed effect. We find that house-specific quality explains {{the vast majority of the}} foreclosure effects on house prices. Our results also show that foreclosed homes in Florida and Indiana lost a considerable amount of value. For example, foreclosed homes in Fort Lauderdale (Florida) lost, on average, $ 42; 110 (12 percent) of the average house price in Florida), while foreclosed houses in Lafayette (Indiana) lost $ 23; 798, which corresponds to 16 : 1 percent of the average house price in Indiana. The estimation results show a significant degree of heterogeneity. In much of Florida, foreclosed houses lost most value at the upper part of the house size and income distributions. In contrast, foreclosed houses in Indiana lost most value at the lower part of those distributions. Finally, we show that non-foreclosed houses agonized losses (from 0 : 8 percent to 4 : 7 percent) due to other houses in the neighborhood being foreclosed...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{enduring}} controversies in antitrust concerns the potential <b>foreclosure</b> <b>effects</b> of vertical integration.

We explore possible sources of vertically integrated producers’ productivity advantage and find that the advantage is tied to firm size, possibly in part through improved logistics coordination, but not to several other possible explanations. ...|$|R
40|$|The case of {{long-term}} exclusive supply contracts in the EU electricity markets {{is a highly}} topical example of the difficulties faced by competition authorities with the deregulation of energy markets.

40|$|Introduction An {{overview}} of media markets shows that rapid {{growth and the}} integration {{of some of the}} most dynamic market segments are characteristics of this fast-moving industry. The main players are the established incumbents upstream and the delivery segments of media downstream. The presence of incumbents, inheritors of previous public monopolies, has led Member States to use regulation in a complementary role with competition. In these markets, strategies to deliver new products and services and to serve new geographic markets focus less on organic growth than on alliances and mergers in order to create multi-media offshoots, bid for control of content rights, increase the diffusion of products and services, and develop technologies for conditional access and transmission standards to capture advantages through proprietary technology. As a result, vertically integrated dominant positions either upstream or downstream have tended to emerge. There is nothing wrong with vertical integration except when there is market power at one stage of the vertical chain. Indeed, as far as the media industry is concerned, there are some specific challenges at the European level. The new EU regulatory framework grants some specific competition principles which can be integrated into ex ante regulation. EU merger control may also prevent potential distortion of competition resulting from the creation or the strengthening of a single or collective dominant position in the media sector at a horizontal level, or from <b>foreclosure</b> <b>effects</b> at a vertical level.

40|$|Foreclosures have {{well-documented}} adverse {{consequences for}} families living in or owning properties undergoing foreclosure and on surrounding neighborhoods, {{but they may}} also have other costs. This policy brief summarizes our research {{on the impact of}} mortgage foreclosures on academic performance among Boston public school students. The data show that students who live at an address that experiences a foreclosure tend to score substantially lower on standardized tests (math and English) and also have substantially worse attendance. However, if we account for the influence of student characteristics, housing, and the student’s past academic performance on test scores, the size of the <b>foreclosure</b> <b>effects</b> is reduced to nearly zero. We interpret these findings as indicating that underlying (yet unobserved) factors such as economic stress within the family contribute to both poor academic performance and the foreclosure event, rather than implying that foreclosure per se causes deterioration in a student’s academic performance. We also find that foreclosures may harm academic performance indirectly by causing an affected student to change schools during the academic year. However, we cannot say with certainty that the strong negative association between a child’s performance and school change—whether the change is precipitated by foreclosure or by other circumstances— reflects a causal relationship. Accordingly, public policies aimed at improving student performance should address family stressors that jointly cause decreased academic performance and foreclosures. Existing school assignment policies in Boston—based as they are on citywide high schools and three broad zones—loosen the link between residential moves and school changes during the school year. Other policies at the school, district, and community level may help to lessen the disruptive effects of academic-year school changes on performance...|$|R

Both rationales suggest a likely cost advantage to using exclusive distributors. This paper evaluates the effect of exclusive distribution arrangements on distributor costs in the Chicago beer market in 1994. I provide a model of consumer demand and firm behavior that incorporates industry details and allows for distribution through exclusive and shared channels. The parameters of the model are then estimated using existing scanner data on beer sales combined with a new data set on sales territories. The estimates provide evidence that brewers who employ exclusive dealing arrangements have lower cost distributors relative to their competitors. The magnitude of this cost advantage {{is estimated to be}} 14 c / per 12 -oz beer, where the average 12 -oz beer has a wholesale price of 50 c/. When the sample is restricted to the major brewers in the Chicago market, exclusive distributors are estimated to confer an 8. 8 c / cost advantage. A simple test indicates that <b>foreclosure</b> <b>effects</b> do not explain these results. Counterfactual experiments suggest that regulatory intervention in distribution arrangements could increase welfare measures by up to 42 %, if exclusivity agreements merely foreclose parts of the market. Alternatively, if exclusive agreements are efficiency enhancing, intervention could decrease welfare measures by up to 21 %. These estimates provide empirical evidence that intervention in exclusivity arrangements can yield large welfare dividends, provided that such intervention is not misapplied. Given that the foreclosure hypothesis is not supported by these data, in this market the most likely effect of intervention would be to substantially reduce social welfare...|$|R

40|$|Many {{communities}} around the country had already been dealing {{with the problems of}} increasing and concentrated foreclosures for several years. Thus, the evidence of the social costs of foreclosures will guide policy makers in deciding what policies should be put in many communities that foreclosures have plagued. The objective of this research is to quantify the price-depressing <b>foreclosure</b> <b>effects</b> on existing home sale prices as one of the major social costs for communities. The first methodological goal is to simultaneously quantify the magnitude of the direct and the spillover <b>effects</b> of <b>foreclosures</b> on existing home prices. The second methodological goal is to provide usefulness concerning spatial econometric models in measuring the impact of foreclosures on housing prices. This study was estimated with traditional hedonic and spatial hedonic models specified during two different housing cycles in Phoenix, Arizona, during a strong housing market when prices were up (2005) and a down housing market with falling prices (2008). It has been shown that <b>foreclosures</b> have negative <b>effects</b> on existing home prices in the neighborhood, depending on housing types and cycles. However, the OLS models do not correct for spatial autocorrelation problems and endogeneity that exist in a cross section of house prices and would overestimate absolute values of the coefficients. As alternatives, the maximum likelihood spatial lag or error model controls for spatial autocorrelation but still causes computation obstacles for large data sets and problems of heteroskedasticity in error terms. Thus, the preferred specification is a generalized method of moments (GMM) approach which requires weaker assumptions than the maximum likelihood application and has flexible form to large datasets. As a joint analysis, the most appropriate specification is the general spatial two-stage least-squares (GMM_ 2 SLS) method with HAC (the spatial heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent) variance estimator. These findings provide further evidence that OLS estimates of a coefficient on a foreclosure indicator tend to overstate the direct or indirect foreclosure discount, ignoring spatial effects such as spatial dependence and endogeneity. With regard to the spillover <b>effect</b> of nearby <b>foreclosures</b> on home prices, both foreclosures of single family homes and condos are statistically significant and negatively impact each type of home sale prices. However, the cumulative <b>effects</b> of neighborhood <b>foreclosures</b> are much greater with nonlinear effects in a housing bust year than a housing boom year. Therefore, this study on price-depressing <b>effects</b> of <b>foreclosures</b> emphasizes the importance of the pre-foreclosure step as the beginning of following foreclosure processes, depending on housing types and housing market cycles...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to the wave of residential mortgage foreclosures {{in the past few}} years, federal, state and local government intervention programs have aimed to reduce the presumed social costs of foreclosures. Before the recent crisis, there was little economic research documenting <b>foreclosure</b> spillover <b>effects.</b> This article takes a critical look at the recent literature that seeks to estimate the negative effects of residential mortgage foreclosures. This review suggests that foreclosed properties sell at a discount, likely because such properties are in worse condition than surrounding properties.

The author suggests that the considerable variation in foreclosure discount and spillover estimates that occurs from study to study may be related to data limitations (specific places and times) and poorly specified empirical models in some studies.
