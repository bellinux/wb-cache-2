There are many sorting algorithms. All sorting algorithms are problem specific. The particular Algorithm one chooses depends on the properties of the data and operations one may perform on data. Accordingly, we will want to know the complexity of each algorithm; that is, to know the running time f(n) of each algorithm as a function of the number n of input elements and to analyses the space and time requirements of our algorithms. Selection of best sorting algorithm for a particular problem depends upon problem definition. Comparisons of sorting algorithms are based on different scenario.

Secure multi-party computation techniques can dispel parties ’ doubts about revealing privacy information in this situation.

This paper considers the problem of privacy preserving DBSCAN clustering over vertically partitioned data based on some results of SMC. An efficient secure intersection protocol is first proposed. The security and complexity of the protocols are also analyzed. The results show that the protocols preserve the privacy of the data and the time complexity as well as the communication complexity is acceptable. 1...|$|E
