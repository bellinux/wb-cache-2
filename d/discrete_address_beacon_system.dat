Both features are required to support the planned automation of air traffic control.

This scheme allows the ground sensor to control the timing of replies from neighboring aircraft, eliminating the self-interference due to overlapping replies (termed synchronous garble) which is a basic limitation of the present Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS).

40|$|A forty-hour flight {{program was}} {{completed}} to study {{signal to noise}} ratio, lane counting and position accuracy using a low cost Omega navigation system in a general aviation aircraft. Specific test objectives were developed to investigate signals both {{on the bench and}} in the air. Signal to noise ratio and lane counting characteristics were investigated in a single frequency, uncorrected mode and in a pseudo-differential mode. It was learned that the received signal to noise ratio is highly correlated with lane counting characteristics and receiver navigability. The relationship between system accuracy and reliability was also examined. The Omega navigation system's bias and position accuracy were investigated with the aid of the <b>Discrete</b> <b>Address</b> <b>Beacon</b> <b>System</b> (DABS). A circular probable error of 3500 feet was observed. It was also determined that certain necessary hardware and system improvements must be implemented before a completely usable Omega navigation system can be offered to the general aviation user.

40|$|The Air Traffic Control (ATC) {{system is}} {{evolving}} under a general plan {{specified by the}} Federal Aviation Administration. Among the developments being considered is the <b>Discrete</b> <b>Address</b> <b>Beacon</b> <b>System</b> (DABS). The use of this system, although relieving congestion on the communications frequencies, would eliminate information about other aircraft because the party line communications now in use would be lost. One alternative to restore this lost information is an Airborne Traffic Situation Display (TSD). Experienced airline and military pilots participated in a factorial design to evaluate two types of communication (discrete address, party line) and two types of displays (TSD, no TSD). A stop-action quiz {{was used to evaluate}} their knowledge of other aircrafts' position, altitude, speed, heading, rate of climb, identity, and landing sequence number. Significant differences between conditions were detected, primarily in the position variables. Workload, as measured by a spare capacity side-task, showed a main effect of displays and a significant interaction between displays and communications. The data are summarized by plotting each display/communication condition configuration in the plane defined by information and workload index. A limited number of blunders by other aircraft were included in the simulations with a significant, but not entirely satisfactory, improvement in blunder detection attributed to the TSD...|$|E

40|$|Emergency <b>Beacon</b> <b>System</b> {{has become}} a {{necessity}} as the demand for double income families is increasing these days. Due to the limitation of reality, people nowadays are not capable {{of taking care of}} the elderly. At the same time, the tremendous increase of cases of sudden death among solitary living elderly had drawn attention to the society to solve this problem. Hence, attaching an emergency <b>beacon</b> <b>system</b> with the elderly will guarantee the safety of the elderly where immediate assistance will be provided when the system is activated. Currently, several types of cell phones in the market attempted to provide solution to this problem by including emergency beacon function such as speed dialing. However, these beacons are using voice based emergency system and is not efficient due to the nature where human will feel panic or blank out their mind when emergency occurs and resulting in difficulties in providing correct information when something emergency occurred. Besides that, it is difficult for elderly with vision problem to press the speed dial button if depending on cell phone. These issues might delay the rescue time and cause some avoidable tragedies. These limitations become a motivation to develop an easy to operate, low cost, SMS based and user friendly emergency <b>beacon</b> <b>system.</b> The purpose of this microcontroller-based emergency <b>beacon</b> <b>system</b> is to send multiple text messages to certain preset numbers by activating a push button via GSM network. Color coded dedicated push button make it easy for elderly to send emergency message. An alarm function will remind elderly to update their current status for their family or guardian.

For further enhancement, this system can be integrated using a GPS module to detect the current location and it will become a perfect emergency <b>beacon</b> <b>system</b> which can be used in any place to trace the location of the sender to provide necessary assistance immediately...|$|R
