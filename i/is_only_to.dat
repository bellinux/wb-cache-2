5|$|Reformed confessions {{reject the}} Catholic {{doctrine}} that the Eucharist is a sacrifice of propitiation, or sacrifice to satisfy God's wrath and attain forgiveness of sins. Instead, they teach that Christ's body <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> be received, not re-presented to God as a sacrifice. The confessions do sometimes {{speak of the}} Supper as a sacrifice of thanksgiving for the gift of propitiation which has been received. In the twentieth century, Scottish Reformed theologian T. F. Torrance developed a strong doctrine of Eucharistic sacrifice. He argued that Christ's person and work could not be separated, and that the Eucharist mediated his sacrificial death.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Indy recovers {{the cross}} {{off the coast}} of Portugal and donates it to Marcus Brody's museum. Later, Indy is {{introduced}} to Walter Donovan, who informs him that Indy's father, Henry Jones Sr., has vanished while searching for the Holy Grail, using an incomplete inscription as his guide. Indy then receives Henry's Grail diary via mail from Venice. Realizing that he would not have sent the diary unless he was in trouble, Indy and Marcus travel to Venice, where they meet Henry's Austrian colleague, Dr. Elsa Schneider. Beneath the library where Henry was last seen, Indy and Elsa discover the tomb of a First Crusade knight, which also contains a complete version of the inscription that Henry had used, this one revealing the location of the Grail. They flee, however, when the catacombs are set aflame by the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword, a secret society that protects the Grail from evildoers. Indy and Elsa capture one of the Brotherhood, Kazim, and Indy tells him that his goal <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> find his father and that he has no interest in finding the Grail. Kazim tells him that Henry is being held in Castle Brunwald on the Austrian-German border. Marcus later reveals a map drawn by Henry of the route to the Grail, which begins in Alexandretta. Indy removes the pages containing the map from the diary, gives it to Marcus for safekeeping and sends Marcus to İskenderun, the city built on the ruins of Alexandretta to rendezvous with their old friend Sallah, and he and Elsa head to Castle Brunwald.|$|E

25|$|Evolution, like prohibition, {{is a broad}} term.

25|$|Her former friends aren't {{doing much}} better: Annie (Diane Keaton), meanwhile, is separated, {{suffering}} extreme self-esteem issues, {{and going through}} therapy with her husband. Brenda (Bette Midler) is divorced, left for a younger woman, depressed, and struggling financially. Elise (Goldie Hawn), whose husband also left her for a younger woman, is now an aging alcoholic movie actress who has become a plastic-surgery addict to keep her career afloat. Shortly after Cynthia's funeral, at which the three remaining friends are reunited {{for the first time}} since college, Annie's husband, Aaron (Stephen Collins), leaves her for her younger therapist (Marcia Gay Harden) and asks her for a divorce after spending a night together (and leading Annie to believe it would reconcile them); Brenda has a rather unpleasant encounter at a clothing store with her ex, Morty (Dan Hedaya) and his younger and rather hateful mistress Shelly (Sarah Jessica Parker), and Elise finds out that her soon-to be ex-husband, Bill (Victor Garber), is requesting alimony and half of their marital assets claiming that Elise owes her fame to him. Also, during a meeting with a director for a possible leading lady movie role, she discovers that she <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> play the lead female's mother; she later learns the lead female is Bill's current girlfriend. Shortly thereafter, the three friends receive the letters that Cynthia mailed to them before her suicide. After each one reads her letter from Cynthia, and feeling that they have been taken for granted by their husbands, the women decide to create the First Wives Club, aiming to get revenge on their exes. Annie's lesbian daughter Chris (Jennifer Dundas) also gets in on the plan by asking for a job at her father's advertising agency so she can supply her mother with inside information, as payback for Aaron's unfairness toward Annie.|$|E

500|$|Section 3 of the Act thus [...] "contemplates the {{possibility}} of an investigation by the court so that it may satisfy itself where the truth lies". The extent of the investigation depends on whether a public authority's exercise of the power to detain rests on the existence or absence of certain jurisdictional or precedent facts. If so, the court must assess if the authority has correctly established the existence or otherwise of these facts. However, if the power to detain is not contingent on precedent facts, the court's task <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> determine whether there exists evidence upon which the authority could reasonably have acted.|$|E
500|$|Its treble panel {{diaphragm}} {{is further}} subdivided into midrange and tweeter sections, achieved by clamping it {{on each side}} of its centre. Both midrange and tweeter sections are driven separately, and the entire treble unit operates at substantially lower voltages – operating voltages are said to be 6000V for the bass and 1500V for the treble. The speaker needs to be plugged into the mains and must be charged prior to use. This is because the diaphragm operates in a [...] "constant charge" [...] mode, and it takes time for the charge to build up. In practice, the speaker is usable after charging for less than half a minute, but the sound gradually improves as the charge builds up. Best performance is achieved when the speaker has charged fully, which can take up to an hour. The electricity <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> charge the diaphragm, so consumption is negligible.|$|E

[...] Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode {{was similar to the}} earlier [...] "Per Manum" [...] and was somewhat formulaic; however, they noted that this was a necessary and positive step towards redefining the series after the changes made in its last two seasons explaining [...] "the point of all this <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> emphasise how different The X-Files universe now feels, the familiarity of the ingredients only making us more aware that the mix is never {{going to be the same}} again".

[...] Here, I-287 intersects I-78 at the Vincent R. Kramer Interchange, where the local-express lane configuration ends. Access from eastbound I-78 to southbound I-287 <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> the local lanes. Meanwhile, the express lanes of northbound I-287 {{provides access to}} westbound I-78 while the local lanes provide access to eastbound I-78. [...] Following I-78, I-287 heads north with four northbound lanes and three southbound lanes into more wooded surroundings, reaching another interchange with US202/US206. At this point, the freeway median widens again as it turns northeast before continuing more {{to the east and}} entering Far Hills. Within Far Hills, the road passes under CR512 before the northbound direction narrows to three lanes and the wide median ends. Entering Bernards Township, I-287 runs east-northeast to an interchange with CR525. After the CR525 interchange, the road gains a wide median that narrows again before the road runs under New Jersey Transit's Gladstone Branch, heading more to the northeast. Before leaving Bernards Township, there is an exit for North Maple Avenue.|$|E
500|$|A modern {{analysis}} by Ari Daniel Levine places {{more of the}} blame on deficiencies {{in the military and}} bureaucratic leadership. The loss of northern China was not inevitable. The military was overextended by a government too assured of its own military prowess. Huizong diverted the state's resources to failed wars against the Western Xia. The Song insistence on a greater share of Liao territory only succeeded in provoking their Jin allies. Song diplomatic oversights underestimated the Jin and allowed the unimpeded rise of Jurchen military power. The state had plentiful resources, with the exception of horses, but managed its assets poorly during battles. Unlike the expansive Han and Tang empires that preceded the Song, the Song did not have a significant foothold in Central Asia where a large proportion of its horses could be bred or procured. As Song general Li Gang noted, without a consistent supply of horses the dynasty was at a significant disadvantage against Jurchen cavalry: [...] "the Jin were victorious only because they used iron-shielded cavalry, while we opposed them with foot soldiers. It <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> be expected that [...] were scattered and dispersed." ...|$|E
500|$|The Supreme Court's {{decision}} to use Chevron as its test for reviewing the Treasury Department's decision for marked a departure from previous practice; the Court had the courts have previously given less deference to the Internal Revenue Service's statutory interpretations. According to {{an article in the}} Florida Tax Review, the Court in doing so [...] "unambiguously overruled" [...] its previous decision in the National Muffler in favor of Chevron, finding that an agency should have leeway in interpreting the statute in question, no matter when or how long ago the statute was placed in effect, how consistent the agency was in interpreting the statute, the importance of the statute or how closely Congress has looked into the agency's decision. However, an article in the George Washington Law Review which advocates {{for the use of the}} National Muffler standard in reviewing retroactive tax regulations (...) states that National Muffler may not have been entirely overruled, arguing that the Court implied that Chevron test <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> be used in [...] "complex questions of statutory interpretation" [...] and that the Court left open the possibility that a future scenario may warrant the use of the National Muffler test instead of the Chevron test.|$|E
