Covering the period of 2006 to 2010, the second Indicative Cooperation Programme (ICP) aligned Luxembourg’s {{interventions}} with Vietnam’s five-year Socio-Economic Development Plan and supported, with a budget of 50 million EUR, development policies and strategies to achieve the MDGs of the Vietnamese government. Under the overall objective of poverty reduction, the second ICP paid special attention to assisting the poorest provinces and most remote districts.With a budget of 42 million EUR, the third ICP (2011-2015) has a twofold approach. Poverty reduction remains the main objective, support through programmes in social sectors, namely health and local development. In addition the needs and new challenges faced by a middle income country are addressed through an increased focus on capacity building and human resource development in the banking and finance sector {{as well as in}} the vocational training sector including tourism and hospitality. With health, local development and vocational training as priority sectors and with a concentration of activities in the four provinces of Thua Thien Hue, Cao Bang, Bac Kan and Nghe An, the third ICP identifies the same priorities as the previous programme.If the current ICP is a continuity of previous interventions, it constitutes also a consolidation of Luxembourg’s support and aims at diversifying relations between the two countries. With the achievement of the status of a middle income country, enhanced international and regional integration and with continued industrialisation, the needs of Vietnam in terms of international assistance have been changing. Luxembourg adapts its development cooperation accordingly and proposes further support in the field of green growth, capacity building in the finance and banking sector {{as well as in the}} sector of medical research. As the implementation of these activities can rely on specific expertise based in Luxembourg, they constitute adequate means to a transition to stronger and diversified relations beyond development cooperation between the two countries.The third ICP also takes into consideration recent developments in the field of aid effectiveness.A stronger emphasis on cooperation with the private sector is carried out through interventions in the banking and finance sector whereas local development projects aim at close cooperation with civil society and community based organisations. The ICP also includes a variety of aid modalities such as more programme oriented approaches in the health sector, a delegated cooperation to the health sector support programme implemented by the European Commission and collaboration with UN agencies. 20% of the <b>financial</b> <b>envelope</b> of ICP III is dedicated to multilateral projects targeting the same sectors as the bilateral projects, in order to strengthen synergies and to increase their impact. The Luxembourg development cooperation contributes to the One UN Fund (2012-2016) which directly supports the implementation of the One UN Plan in Vietnam. It also works directly with five UN agencies in Vietnam: UNCTAD, UN Women, UNICEF, ILO and UNESCO.A mid-term evaluation of the current ICP, conducted in June 2014, underlined the important and visible results and impacts reached by Luxembourg’s development cooperation and its Vietnamese partners on provincial level, be it in strengthening health care in Cao Bang and Bac Kan provinces, in improving income of vulnerable groups in remote areas of Nghe An province, in providing high standard vocational training for tourism and hospitality students in Hue Tourism College and associated schools and in supporting the Vietnam States Securities Commission in creating a better environment for foreign investors. The evaluation also drew conclusions on the need to further diversify relations between the two countries.|$|E

Weighing against the sale are arguments about optimal risk allocation and network externalities. In contrast, there is a productive efficiency case in favour of the sale. Privatisation also raises questions about private monopoly power and the delivery of community service obligations, although these could be handled through contract specifications. The sale price is essentially a distributional issue. The back-ofthe- <b>envelope</b> <b>financial</b> analysis here suggests that the mooted sale price of $ 3 billion would undervalue the asset and therefore transfer net worth from Queensland taxpayers to private investors.

However, the state of Titan's surface is largely unknown and it may be at least partially covered in liquid hydrocarbons. With such ignorance of the surface state, and the limited <b>financial</b> <b>envelope</b> of the project, it is not practicable to design the Probe to 'soft-land'. Survival may, nevertheless, be possible and this paper presents various impact-dynamics analysis methods and assesses the likely impact scenarios and their survivability. It is concluded that the Probe has a good chance of surviving to continue its scientific mission from the surface. The scientific information about the surface that could be gathered from impact-dynamics measurements is also discussed...|$|E

As well as electing a new team of {{officials}} to lead the organization and establishing a <b>financial</b> <b>envelope</b> {{for the next four}} years, PP- 98 faced two main issues. The first was to conclude the work begun at the 1992 Geneva Additional Plenipotentiary Conference by amending the ITU Constitution to give greater rights and responsibilities to the ITU's private sector members. The second was to adopt strategic policies and plans to guide the Union into the 21 st century. After first situating the Minneapolis conference {{in the context of the}} ITU's unique organizational structure, culture and working methods, the paper describes the main results of the Minneapolis conference with respect to these two issues. It highlights constitutional amendments made which open the ITU to greater participation by the private sector, as well as to give non-governmental actors a greater role in providing advice and making decisions on technical issues. The paper then outlines the five strategies adopted by the conference to guide the activities of the Union in the next four years. In conclusion, it attempts to assess the principal challenges facing the ITU in terms of policy and organizational development. ...|$|E

40|$|So far, {{strategies}} {{to reduce the}} environmental impact of buildings focused on lowering the energy needs. Improving the characteristics of the building leads to a lower heating energy demand but also needs more construction materials to be used, especially insulation and airtightness materials. In the Walloon Region, a system of <b>financial</b> subsidies for <b>envelope</b> insulation has been implemented. In addition to the basic subsidy, an additional one of 3 €/m² is granted if a «natural insulation material» is used. « Natural insulation material » is currently defined by the Ministerial Decree of the Walloon Government as a material containing 85 % or more fibers originating from plants or animals, or cellulose. The present contribution aims to analyse and improve this current definition. The authors show that a pertinent choice cannot only be based on raw materials composition but must refer to many other criteria, taking into account the whole life cycle of the material. An assessment model and a weighting of the criteria were developed and tested on 39 generic materials based on the data coming from available database and scientific literature...|$|R
40|$|Meeting the {{expectation}} of delivering safe, effective, and timely health care services within current <b>financial</b> and workforce <b>envelopes</b> requires all health care clinicians to refine and adapt to their clinical roles. The arena of critical care is currently receiving increasing scrutiny regarding developing dedicated advanced practice roles. This is challenging to critical care nurses who historically neither {{have been exposed to}} nor have chosen to engage in such specific role developments. The critical care nursing community has, on the whole, embraced previous role expansions within the limits of existing group practices rather than an evolution of new subspecialties. International comparisons demonstrate that critical care nurses in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia are all facing common health policy drivers. Although there are some similarities in addressing these challenges, the solutions remain at various stages of development. The natural history framework of Bucher [Work and Occupations 1988; 15 : 131 - 147] provides a useful and supportive tool to understand how it is necessary and natural for specialties within occupational groups to emerge to meet changing health care needs. A shared concern providing challenges at national and international levels involves the coordination of educational standards as well as competencies and clear articulation of the leadership component of advanced practice roles. These areas must be addressed to enable the international critical care community to naturally transform and evolve into fully established and legitimate advanced practitioners...|$|R
40|$|With {{a review}} of the literature, we {{described}} the integrated care management experiences of Kaiser Permanente (KP) and the Veterans health administration (VHA) in the USA. These types of healthcare organisation (a non-profit HMO [health maintenance organization] and a public institution) enable cost control, compatible with a high quality of care. We analysed the innovations that they provide in terms of organisation and care practices and the principles to be retained in order to improve the efficiency of the French system. The KP and VHA results can be attributed to: - A practice founded on evidence based medicine and disease management, recently adapted to chronic condi-tions. In comparison with the NHS in the United Kingdom, KP has only a third of the amount of short-stays and hospital stay durations are 20 % shorter. - A single management and the absence of a sealed <b>financial</b> <b>envelope.</b> - An organisation involving integration at all levels: joint administrative management with doctors, integration of an insurance system with a care system, outpatient care with hospital care, prevention with curative care (managed care and case management). This organisational consistency enables interdependent players to see the point and advantage in coordinating their practices and working together as a team. In France, integration is slow to be established as a necessity for healthcare players. However, active disease management of the 7. 5 million patients with a long-term condition could bring a drive for change. As the Haut conseil pour l’avenir de l’assurance maladie (French high council for the future of health insurance) suggests, there is an opportunity to be seized by the insurance medicine system with the protocolisation of care for these patients...|$|E
40|$|Auf dem Hintergrund des bevorstehenden Nato-Gipfels in Bukarest 2008 diskutiert die Studie die Problemstellungen im Zusammenhang mit der Frage einer Raketenabwehr in Europa. Die zentrale Frage der Studie ist, welche Handlungsoptionen die europäischen Nato-Mitglieder vor dem Hintergrund der raschen Fortentwicklung des amerikanischen Programms besitzen. Neben einer Betrachtung der Risiken und Bedrohungen für Europa werden Vorschläge für einen möglichen europäischen Beitrag, eine strukturelle Architektur und ein Führungs- und Entscheidungsverfahren unter Beteiligung der Europäer erarbeitet und Russlands Rolle in der Debatte diskutiert. Zusätzlich ist ein Handlungsrahmen für die Bundesregierung zu definieren, im Zentrum derer Ziele und Interessen deutscher Sicherheitspolitik stehen. Die Analyse kommt zu dem Ergebnis, dass es mit vertretbaren, geringen technologischen Risiken verbunden wäre, das amerikanische Angebot anzunehmen, und sich stufenweise an der Raketenabwehr zu beteiligen. Ohne das Bündnis in seiner Handlungsfähigkeit zu lähmen, sollten zur Entspannung der Lage jedoch auch realisierbare Kooperationsfelder mit Russland identifiziert werden. (ICH) 'At the NATO {{summit in}} Bucharest {{at the end}} of April 2008, one of the issues the Alliance will deal with is the {{question}} of missile defence for Europe. Within the framework of its missile defence programme, the United States want to station ten interceptors in Poland and a radar in the Czech Republic. According to the indications of the American government those elements could protect 75 percent of European territory. A decision on the way ahead would be of fundamental importance for the general strategic direction taken by the Alliance. In the emotionally-charged public discussion, one extremely relevant aspect has not received much attention. Missile defence touches on the core of the original reason for the existence of NATO: the protection of the Alliance area and its inhabitants from harm. If Germany should come within the range of regimes equipped with weapons of mass destruction, and if military action by the international community against these regimes became necessary, Germany's strategic situation would change radically. The central question of this analysis is what options the European members of NATO have in view of the rapid development of the American programme. In addition, proposals for a possible European contribution, a command-structure and a decision-making process involving the Europeans, are considered. The research paper comes to the conclusion that accepting Washington's offer and progressive involvement in missile defence would bring justifiable, quite low technological risks. The project would also fall within an acceptable <b>financial</b> <b>envelope,</b> and be accompanied by an enormous increase in military capabilities for NATO. ' (author's abstract) ...|$|E
