5|$|If k2 {{is greater}} than one, F2−F1 is a {{negative}} number; thus, the added inverse-cube force <b>is</b> <b>attractive,</b> as observed in the green planet of Figures1–4 and 9. By contrast, if k2 is less than one, F2−F1 is a positive number; the added inverse-cube force is repulsive, as observed in the green planet of Figures5 and 10, and in the red planet of Figures4 and 5.|$|E
5|$|Other {{characters}} include various schoolmates {{and staff}} members. Weenus (Michael Sinterniklaas) is a nerdy, psychopathic robot who is even {{lower on the}} social pyramid than the protagonists. Dreadnot (Dana Snyder) is a teacher at Harry S. Apocalypse who finds joy in torturing and invoking pain into his students. Their principal, Thunderbite (also voiced by Snyder), is an oversized, skull-shaped robot who, when not causing pain, acts sweet and motherly to the students. Megawatt (also voiced by Sinterniklaas) is a spoiled rich kid who <b>is</b> <b>attractive</b> to the female robots, most of whom he blows up; to Thrasher's disdain, he is dating Maimy. Tacklebot (Roger Craig Smith), Megawatt's friend and musclehead jock, acts violent and hostile toward the protagonists.|$|E
5|$|When God Writes Your Love Story was {{received}} positively by some American Christian authors. In Freshman: The College Student's Guide to Developing Wisdom, Mark Matlock, an ordained minister and youth pastor recommends When God Writes Your Love Story to college students. He describes the Ludys' book as funny, honest, and candid. Jason Evert, a Catholic author and chastity speaker, wrote positively of When God Writes Your Love Story {{in his book}} If You Really Loved Me: 100 Questions on Dating, Relationships, and Sexual Purity. Evert commends Leslie Ludy writing {{about the importance of}} listening intently and regularly to God's voice in seeking discernment about romantic relationships. Also in If You Really Loved Me, Evert praises a passage from When God Writes Your Love Story in which Leslie Ludy recalls having spoken with a group of young men who all agreed that the most desirable women were those who were slow to establish strong emotional attachments to potential romantic partners, and that the least desirable women were those who were emotionally promiscuous. According to Evert, these men are right; he uses the passage to support his argument that lack of sexual experience <b>is</b> <b>attractive.</b>|$|E

50|$|This {{species is}} a rhizomatous {{perennial}} herb with square stems growing 2 to 3 feet tall. It may spread {{to form a}} colony. The oppositely arranged leaves are lance-shaped and mint-scented. The inflorescence contains tubular reddish purple flowers with purplish bracts beneath. The flowers <b>are</b> <b>attractive</b> to insects. The seed heads <b>are</b> <b>attractive</b> to birds.|$|R
25|$|As {{the fuel}} of a LFTR is a molten salt mixture, it <b>is</b> <b>attractive</b> to use pyroprocessing, high {{temperature}} methods working {{directly from the}} hot molten salt. Pyroprocessing does not use radiation sensitive solvents and is not easily disturbed by decay heat.|$|E
25|$|While {{the design}} {{approach}} <b>is</b> <b>attractive</b> {{to a general}} hearing aid user, open-fit devices can by their design have problems when connected to Assistive Listening Devices (ALD's). This problem has been addressed by manufacturers, who provide assistive listening devices that can be paired with the hearing aid.|$|E
25|$|The single-cylinder bikes have {{a strong}} {{following}} and are thought by many of their riders to be better off-roaders than the heavier boxer-engined bikes. Like the larger two-cylinder models, they offer significant capacity to carry gear and supplies over long distances. Their versatility <b>is</b> <b>attractive</b> to riders who intend to spend weeks, months, even years travelling on two wheels.|$|E

25|$|While the air {{storage system}} offers a {{relatively}} low power density and vehicle range, its high efficiency <b>is</b> <b>attractive</b> for hybrid vehicles that use a conventional internal combustion engine as a main power source.

25|$|Harmless to humans, the bluegrey carpetshark is {{occasionally}} captured incidentally {{by commercial}} fisheries or hooked by recreational anglers. Small numbers are collected {{for the private}} aquarium trade, as it <b>is</b> <b>attractive</b> (especially young sharks) and probably adapts well to captivity. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as Vulnerable, citing its narrow habitat preferences, limited range in a heavily populated region, and apparent rarity.|$|E
25|$|In India {{and east}} Asia Helicias have been {{cultivated}} in botanic gardens, from the 1800s. In Australia they have rarely been cultivated, and {{were thought to}} have little horticultural value. The rusty-coloured new growth <b>is</b> <b>attractive</b> on some species. In some of the better known Australian species, the flowers and fruit are generally not prominent, and plants can be slow growing. They are generally propagated by seed, the viability of which drops rapidly with time.|$|E

25|$|One {{more recent}} {{application}} for flash memory is {{as a replacement}} for hard disks. Flash memory does not have the mechanical limitations and latencies of hard drives, so a solid-state drive (SSD) <b>is</b> <b>attractive</b> when considering speed, noise, power consumption, and reliability. Flash drives are gaining traction as mobile device secondary storage devices; they are also used as substitutes for hard drives in high-performance desktop computers and some servers with RAID and SAN architectures.|$|E
25|$|With {{evidence}} of reciprocation (real or imagined) from the limerent object, {{a state of}} extreme pleasure, even euphoria, is enjoyed. Thoughts are mainly occupied with considering and reconsidering what <b>is</b> <b>attractive</b> in the limerent object, replaying whatever events may have thus far transpired with the limerent object, and appreciating personal qualities perceived as possibly having sparked interest in the limerent object. At peak crystallization, almost all waking thoughts revolve around the limerent object. After this peak, the feelings eventually decline.|$|E
25|$|Although Rawdon knows Becky <b>is</b> <b>attractive</b> to men, he {{believes}} her reputation is spotless {{even though she}} is widely suspected of romantic intrigue with General Tufto and other powerful men. Nobody dares to suggest otherwise to Rawdon because of his temper and his reputation for duelling. Yet other people, particularly the Marquis of Steyne, find it impossible to believe that Crawley is unaware of Becky's tricks. Steyne in particular believes Rawdon is fully aware Becky is prostituting herself, and believes Rawdon is going along with the charade in the hope of financial gain.|$|E
5000|$|Attractiveness, {{specifically}} physical attractiveness, {{has been}} shown to have very profound effects on popularity.

25|$|Space {{disposal}} <b>is</b> <b>attractive</b> {{because it}} removes nuclear waste from the planet. It has significant disadvantages, {{such as the}} potential for catastrophic failure of a launch vehicle, which could spread radioactive material into the atmosphere and around the world. A high number of launches would be required because no individual rocket {{would be able to}} carry very much of the material relative to the total amount that needs to be disposed of. This makes the proposal impractical economically and it increases the risk of at least one or more launch failures.|$|E
25|$|Textiles and {{clothing}} {{is one of}} the largest manufacturing and exporting processes in the country and a huge employment absorber. The Egyptian apparel industry <b>is</b> <b>attractive</b> for two reasons. Firstly, its proximity to European markets, whose rapidly changing fashions require quick replenishment. Egypt's geographical proximity to style-conscious Europe is a logistical advantage. Secondly, the production of garments is a low-capital and high-labor-intensive industry, and the local population of 66 million provides a ready workforce as well as a natural local consumer market that acts as a springboard for exports.|$|E
25|$|The {{coupling}} of MS with LC systems <b>is</b> <b>attractive</b> because {{liquid chromatography}} can separate delicate and complex natural mixtures, which chemical composition {{needs to be}} well established (e.g., biological fluids, environmental samples, and drugs). Nowadays, LC-MS {{has become one of}} the most widely used chemical analysis techniques because more than 85% of natural chemical compounds are polar and thermally labile and GC-MS cannot process these samples. As an example, HPLC-MS is regarded as the leading analytical technique for proteomics and pharmaceutical laboratories. Other important applications of LC-MS include the analysis of food, pesticides, and plant phenols.|$|E
