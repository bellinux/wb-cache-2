40|$|A {{negative}} relationship between intelligence and fertility in the United States has been described repeatedly, but {{little is known about}} the mechanisms that are responsible for this effect. Using data from the NLSY 79, we investigate this issue separately for Blacks, non-Hispanic Whites and Hispanics. The major findings are: (1) Differential fertility would reduce the average IQ of the American population by up to 1. 2 points per generation in the absence of migration and environmental changes; (2) About 0. 4 points of the effect is caused by selection within racial and ethnic groups, and the rest is caused by between-group selection; (3) Differential fertility by intelligence is greatest in Hispanics and smallest in non-Hispanic Whites; (4) The <b>fertility-reducing</b> effect of intelligence is greater in females than males; (5) The IQ-fertility relationship is far stronger for unmarried than married people, especially females; (5) High intelligence does not reduce the desire for children; (6) High intelligence does not reduce the likelihood of marriage; (7) Education is the principal mediator of the IQ effect for married women...|$|E
40|$|As {{climate change}} {{persists}} full bore, economists continue {{to estimate the}} cost effectiveness of various climate mitigation strategies. Minimal research has considered <b>fertility-reducing</b> policies, such as women 2 ̆ 7 s education (WE) and family planning (FP), as competitive emissions abatement strategies. Both WE and FP can mitigate climate change in two ways: they reduce emissions by lowering population growth, and reduce damages by {{reducing the number of}} vulnerable persons, especially when implemented in African countries. Previous research focuses exclusively on the former and neglects the latter entirely. By including the full scope of climate benefits from fertility reduction, it is clear that both WE and FP are highly cost-competitive with other climate mitigation strategies. Additionally, WE and FP are highly valued for social and ethical reasons, but are currently underfunded. Recognizing them as viable climate mitigation strategies could help garner the additional funding that is demanded in the literature. It is long overdue that WE and FP receive international funding on the basis of climate change mitigation, in addition to the fund they already receive for humanitarian reasons...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{public health}} wisdom {{suggests}} that breastfeeding {{has an important}} <b>fertility-reducing</b> effect for a population but is an unreliable contraceptive for an individual woman or couple (Hatcher et al. 1989, 1990). The primary reason is that ovulation can precede the post-partum return of menses, {{so there is no}} reliable signal of the return of fecundity and hence risk of pregnancy. Nevertheless, Kennedy, Rivera and McNeilly (1989 : 479) report that the consensus of a panel of experts (Bellagio Consensus Conference on Lactational Infertility, held in August 1988) is that for women fully breastfeeding (i. e. the child’s diet is not supplemented 1), ‘breastfeeding provides more than 98 per cent protection from pregnancy in the first six months. ’ The evidence supporting this statement is impressively documented 2. The real question is the implication of this fact for public heath policy. The Bellagio consensus statement concludes that lactational amenorrhoea is an appropriate temporary method of fertility regulation, and that at six months post partum, or at the time when either menses return or the infant’s diet of breastmilk is supplemented (if either of these events happens before the infant’s six-month birthday), ‘consideration must be given to other means of family planning’ (Kennedy et al. 1989 : 479). Furthermore, ‘the use of the natural infertility of breastfeeding followed by the use of another family planning method, rather than the simultaneous use of both, may serve t...|$|E
40|$|Economic {{growth and}} {{modernization}} of society are generally associated with fertility rate decreases but which forces trigger this is unclear. In this paper we assess how fertility changes with increased labor market participation {{of women in}} rural Senegal. Evidence from high-income countries suggests that higher female employment rates lead to reduced fertility rates but evidence from developing countries {{at an early stage}} of demographic transition is largely absent. We concentrate on a rural area in northern Senegal where a recent boom in horticultural exports has been associated with a sudden increase in female off-farm employment. Using survey data we show that employed women have a significantly higher age at marriage and at first childbirth, and significantly fewer children. As causal identification strategy we use instrumental variable and difference-in-differences estimations, combined with propensity score matching. We find that female employment reduces the number of children per woman by 25 %, and that this <b>fertility-reducing</b> effect is as large for poor as for non-poor women and larger for illiterate than for literate women. Results imply that female employment is a strong instrument for empowering rural women, reducing fertility rates and accelerating the demographic transition in poor countries. The effectiveness of family planning programs can increase if targeted to areas where female employment is increasing or to female employees directly because of a higher likelihood to reach women with low-fertility preferences. Our results show that changes in fertility preferences not necessarily result from a cultural evolution but can also be driven by sudden and individual changes in economic opportunities...|$|E
40|$|The {{demographic}} phenomenon of “low fertility” has received considerable attention {{over the last}} three decades within academic, political, and public spheres. While a large body of research has led to {{a deeper understanding of the}} underlying social and economic dimensions of low fertility, current theoretical and empirical approaches fail to explain puzzles pertaining to within and across population heterogeneity in fertility rates. This dissertation is comprised of three papers that investigate the social, economic, and demographic causes and consequences of low fertility. Chapter 1 sets forth a new theoretical approach to examining the interrelations between low fertility, socioeconomic development, and gender equity among developed countries. The main findings of this chapter are that 1) the pace and onset of socioeconomic development explain a significant proportion of the variation in fertility among developed countries, 2) low fertility may facilitate changes in gender norms through a “gender-equity dividend”, and 3) contrary to Second Demographic Transition theory, low fertility may be a transitory phase of the demographic transition. Whereas the Chapter 1 looks cross-nationally at gender and fertility dynamics, Chapter 2 takes a micro-level approach by exploring the relationship between fertility and gender norms in the United States. Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY 79), I find that both men and women with progressive views on gender equity have lower fertility than their traditional counterparts, though these results were stronger, more consistent, and more significant across models for women. In Chapter 3 I argue that the rising costs of childrearing through “shadow education” have become a key <b>fertility-reducing</b> force across high, medium, and low-income countries. To investigate this hypothesis, I use data from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and find evidence of a “quality-quantity tradeoff” both within and across populations due to costly shadow education. Collectively, the findings of this dissertation signal that the causes and consequences of low fertility are multifaceted and evolving across time and space. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{agri-food}} sector {{in developing countries}} has been transforming rapidly during the last decades, leading to a more consolidated and vertically integrated agro-industry. Labour market effects are especially pronounced in high-value export sectors. Whether this transformation in the {{agri-food sector}} and the associated employment creation benefits rural households in developing countries remains a highly debated issue. While some argue that {{the economic impact of}} employment is limited due to inferior working conditions, others demonstrate that employment in high-value export sectors can lead to upwards income mobility and poverty reduction but empirical evidence is very scarce. This dissertation aims to fill this research gap by unravelling the links between global food value chains, employment creation and rural development. I focus on the Saint-Louis region in Senegal, a rural area where investments from horticultural export companies have created many off-farm employment opportunities since 2000 s, especially for women. In chapter two I investigate the impact of wage employment on households’ income. I differentiate between employment in the horticultural export industry and employment in other sectors. I use household survey data from two panel rounds in 2006 and 2013 and apply quantile regressions to address unobserved heterogeneity and estimate heterogeneous effects. I demonstrate that employment in the horticultural export sector increases income per capita of the 50 % poorest households with 31 to 57 %, while employment in other sectors increases income per capita of both poor and non-poor households with 82 %. Although employment in other sectors is more remunerative, employment in the horticultural sector is more inclusive, as it employs both poor and non-poor households. In chapter three I analyse the impact of women’s participation in the labour market on fertility rates. Using household- and individual-level survey data I show that employed women have a significantly higher age at marriage and at first childbirth, and significantly fewer children. As causal identification strategy I use instrumental variable and difference-in-differences estimations, combined with propensity score matching. I find that female employment reduces the number of children per woman by 25 %, and that this <b>fertility-reducing</b> effect is as large for poor as for non-poor women and larger for illiterate than for literate women. Results imply that female employment is a strong instrument for empowering rural women, reducing fertility rates and accelerating the demographic transition in poor countries. In chapter four I investigate the impact of female wage employment on women’s subjective wellbeing. I use household- and individual-level survey data and an instrumental variable approach. I find that female employment improves subjective wellbeing for the poorest women but not necessarily for women whose household income has moved well beyond the poverty threshold. Female employment improves women´s happiness through an income effect, as female employment leads to higher income levels and improved living standards, but the non-income effects of female employment reduce women’s happiness. This negative effect is related to a higher workload, low job satisfaction and changing gender roles. In chapter five I analyze contractual preferences of female workers in the horticultural export sector. I use a discrete choice experiment to assess women’s preferences for a labour contract and employ a latent class model to capture preference heterogeneity. I find that women have a high willingness to accept a labour contract in the horticultural export industry and that differences in preferences for contract attributes can be explained by women’s empowerment status. More empowered women prefer flexible, seasonal contracts that include job tasks in the conditioning centres and that provide pick-up service. Less empowered women prefer labour contracts that offer company services, especially health care and training, {{and to a lesser extent}} pick-up service. Overall, this dissertation shows that development of global food value chains can benefit rural households in developing countries through employment creation. Policy implications entail that investments from the horticultural export industry can contribute to a pro-poor economic growth. However, to ensure long-term welfare benefits of employment, working conditions should improve by increasing wages and employment duration. Specific policies on women’s empowerment should take the increase in female wage employment opportunities into account, e. g. through family planning programs that target employed women who have low-fertility preferences. nrpages: 159 status: publishe...|$|E
