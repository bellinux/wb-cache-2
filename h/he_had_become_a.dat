5|$|In {{conjunction}} with Andrew Collomosse, Swan released an autobiography in 2008 entitled Swanny: Confessions of a Lower-League Legend, published by John Blake. The foreword {{was written by}} Helen Chamberlain, presenter of Soccer AM. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> running gag on the show in 2000 after every week the show's production staff persuaded their footballing guest to tell the audience their best mate in football was Peter Swan.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, the public, through newspapers, {{followed}} Baden-Powell's {{struggle to}} hold Mafeking, {{and when the}} siege was broken, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> national hero. This rise to fame fuelled the sales of the small instruction book he had written in 1899 about military scouting and wilderness survival, Aids to Scouting, that owed much {{to what he had}} learned from discussions with Burnham.|$|E
5|$|Neighbour Clive (John Biggins) had {{a part in}} {{a single}} scene in the first series, but had a larger part in an episode of the second series; by the third series <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> {{prominent}} character, concerned about the well-being of his elderly mother who is very delicate and has had problems with losing her cat and having teenagers throwing rubbish over her wall.|$|E

5|$|Once {{he was a}} civilian, Mitchell {{assumed a}} {{prominent}} role in the “Save the Argylls” campaign. He wrote his memoirs (“Having Been a Soldier”), undertook some freelance journalism and briefly took a job as management trainee with Beaverbrook Newspapers. However, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> popular public figure and turned this to his advantage when he started a new career in politics.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from his}} World War I-era service in Mexico and Europe, his {{overseas}} postings {{had been in}} Asia and the Pacific. During World War II, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> national hero and had been awarded the Medal of Honor for the unsuccessful defense of the Philippines in the Battle of Bataan. He had commanded the Allied armies in the New Guinea Campaign and Philippines Campaign, fulfilling his famous promise {{to return to the}} Philippines. In 1944 and 1948, he had been considered a possible Republican candidate for president. After the war, as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers (SCAP), he had overseen the Occupation of Japan and played an important part in the post-war political and social transformation of that country.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1950s Barnes {{was one of}} the senior players in the side, and succeeded Roy Paul as captain when Paul retired in 1957. During the 1957–58 season Barnes became the third player to score a hat-trick of {{penalties}} in an English top-flight match, as part of a 6–2 defeat of Everton. At this time Barnes was the club's primary penalty taker, helping him to score 11 goals {{over the course of the}} season. In his later years at Manchester City, Barnes role as captain meant <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> strong influence on younger players. A particularly notable example was Denis Law, who joined the club in 1960, the pair becoming lifelong friends.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{originally}} {{being told}} by Redknapp he was not of Division One standard, let alone suitable for the Premier League, Primus proved his manager wrong by seizing his chance when other players missed out through injury and suspension. By {{the end of the}} 2002–03 season <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> vital member of the side that won the Division One title, winning the Portsmouth fans' player of the season as well as the PFA accolade for Division One. He scored once that season for Portsmouth in the League Cup against Peterborough United. Primus credits his renaissance to his conversion to Christianity after a friend of his wife's invited him to church.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in Lough Mask before the {{controversy}} began, Boycott had become unpopular with the tenants. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> magistrate and was an Englishman, which {{may have contributed to}} his unpopularity, but according to Marlow it was due more to his personal temperament. While Boycott himself maintained that he was on good terms with his tenants, they said that he had laid down many petty restrictions, such as not allowing gates to be left open and not allowing hens to trespass on his property, and that he fined anyone who transgressed these restrictions. He had also withdrawn privileges from the tenants, such as collecting wood from the estate. In August 1880, his labourers went on strike in a dispute over a wage increase.|$|E
5|$|Greaves was {{struggling}} with his fitness and his motivation. He felt <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> journeyman footballer and lost motivation as he believed that apart from Moore, Geoff Hurst, Billy Bonds and Pop Robson, few of his teammates could play good football. Towards {{the end of his}} career with West Ham Greaves began to drink more and more alcohol, often going straight from training in Chadwell Heath to a pub in Romford, where he would remain until closing time. He later admitted that he was in the early stages of alcoholism. His final game came on 1 May 1971 in a 1–0 home defeat to Huddersfield Town. Greaves scored 13 goals in 40 games in all competitions for West Ham.|$|E

5|$|Hand {{graduated}} from Harvard Law School in 1896 {{at the age}} of 24. He returned to Albany to live with his mother and aunt, and started work for the law firm in which an uncle, Matthew Hale, was a partner. Hale's unexpected death a few months later obliged Hand to move to a new firm, but by 1899, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> partner. He had difficulty attracting his own clients, however, and found the work trivial and dull. Much of his time was spent researching and writing briefs, with few opportunities for the appellate work he preferred. His early courtroom appearances, when they came, were frequently difficult, sapping his fragile self-confidence. He began to fear that he lacked the ability to think on his feet in court.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{where much}} of the vampire {{folklore}} originates, the vampire is usually considered a fictitious being; many communities may have embraced the revenant for economic purposes. In some cases, especially in small localities, vampire superstition is still rampant and sightings or claims of vampire attacks occur frequently. In Romania during February 2004, several relatives of Toma Petre feared that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> vampire. They dug up his corpse, tore out his heart, burned it, and mixed the ashes with water in order to drink it.|$|E
5|$|Living out {{the rest}} of his days as a farmer, Jonathan Alder died on January 30, 1849, in Canaan Township, Madison County, Ohio, at the age of 75. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> {{well-known}} figure in the region, and is still remembered today with a school district, high school, and middle school named after him. A historical marker was erected by Ohio in front of Foster Chapel Cemetery at , near West Jefferson, where he is buried. The cabin Alder built in 1806 is now located at the Madison County Historical Society Museum in London.|$|E

5|$|McCain {{entered the}} race for the Republican {{nomination}} for President in 2000, but he lost a heated primary season contest to George W. Bush of Texas. He secured the nomination in 2008 after coming back from early reversals, but was defeated by Democratic nominee Barack Obama in the general election, losing by a 365–173 electoral college margin. He subsequently adopted more orthodox conservative stances and attitudes and largely opposed actions of the Obama administration, especially in regard to foreign policy matters. By 2013, however, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> key figure in the Senate for negotiating deals on certain issues in an otherwise partisan environment. In 2015, McCain became chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} frustration, Honório Hermeto (or Paraná as he became known) had largely recouped the {{prestige}} he had formerly possessed among his peers. He had liquidated his uncle's domestic slave trading business {{and used the}} proceeds to become a coffee plantation owner in 1836. The land he acquired was located in the hills between Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais. Although Paraná staunchly opposed {{the abolition of the}} transatlantic African slave trade, the importation of slaves was abolished in 1850 by the Eusébio de Queirós Law. The ban on slave imports seems to have had no impact over Paraná's private affairs; by 1852, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> very wealthy man. He also married his son Honório to a niece of Rodrigues Torres, thus establishing a link between his family and the province of Rio de Janeiro's planter aristocracy.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} ten, after {{spending}} his first decade in Benares, Shankar went to Paris with the dance group of his brother, choreographer Uday Shankar. By the age of 13 <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> member of the group, accompanied its members on tour and learned to dance and play various Indian instruments. Uday's dance group toured Europe and the United States {{in the early to}} mid-1930s and Shankar learned French, discovered Western classical music, jazz, cinema and became acquainted with Western customs. Shankar heard Allauddin Khan – the lead musician at the court of the princely state of Maihar – play at a music conference in December 1934 in Calcutta, and Uday convinced the Maharaja of Maihar in 1935 to allow Khan to become his group's soloist for a tour of Europe. Shankar was sporadically trained by Khan on tour, and Khan offered Shankar training to become a serious musician under the condition that he abandon touring and come to Maihar.|$|E

5|$|Before play begins, the Dungeon Master (or DM, {{the player}} who organizes and directs the game play) {{randomly}} draws five cards from a deck of six. Two of these cards determine the locations of two magical weapons useful in defeating Strahd: the Holy Symbol and the Sunsword. The next two cards determine the locations of Strahd and the Tome of Strahd, a book that details Strahd's long-ago unrequited love. In this work, it is revealed that Strahd {{had fallen in love}} with a young girl, who in turn loved his younger brother. Strahd blamed his age for the rejection, and made a pact with evil powers to live forever. He then slew his brother, but the young girl killed herself in response, and Strahd found that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> vampire. All six possible locations are inside Castle Ravenloft.|$|E
5|$|Constantine {{received}} a formal education at Diocletian's court, {{where he learned}} Latin literature, Greek, and philosophy. The cultural environment in Nicomedia was open, fluid and socially mobile, and Constantine could mix with intellectuals both pagan and Christian. He may have attended the lectures of Lactantius, a Christian scholar of Latin in the city. Because Diocletian did not completely trust Constantius—none of the Tetrarchs fully trusted their colleagues—Constantine was held {{as something of a}} hostage, a tool to ensure Constantius's best behavior. Constantine was nonetheless a prominent member of the court: he fought for Diocletian and Galerius in Asia, and served in a variety of tribunates; he campaigned against barbarians on the Danube in 296AD, and fought the Persians under Diocletian in Syria (297AD) and under Galerius in Mesopotamia (298–299AD). By late 305AD, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> tribune of the first order, a tribunus ordinis primi.|$|E
5|$|Craig had {{a strong}} Sheffield Shield season in 1960–61. At the time, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> {{production}} manager at his pharmaceutical firm and declared that the season {{would be his last}} owing to work commitments. His employers had been pressuring him to commit to a career after cricket. Early in the campaign, Craig scored consecutive centuries against Queensland and Victoria. He then scored 83 as New South Wales defeated the touring West Indians by an innings and 97 runs, but he was overlooked for Test selection. He ended his season with 197 in an innings victory over Western Australia. Overall, he totalled 710 runs at 59.16, as New South Wales won their eighth successive Shield. After a successful campaign, he reversed his decision and made himself available for the 1961 tour of England, but Bill Lawry was selected ahead of him.|$|E
