2500|$|If the {{comparator}} {{does not}} have internal hysteresis or if the <b>input</b> <b>noise</b> {{is greater than the}} internal hysteresis then an external hysteresis network can be built using positive feedback from the output to the non-inverting input of the comparator. The resulting Schmitt trigger circuit gives additional noise immunity and a cleaner output signal. Some comparators such as , , , [...] and [...] also provide the hysteresis control through a separate hysteresis pin. These comparators make it possible to add a programmable hysteresis without feedback or complicated equations. Using a dedicated hysteresis pin is also convenient if the source impedance is high since the inputs are isolated from the hysteresis network. When hysteresis is added then a comparator cannot resolve signals within the hysteresis band.|$|E
2500|$|The self-noise or {{equivalent}} <b>input</b> <b>noise</b> level {{is the sound}} level that creates the same output voltage as the microphone does {{in the absence of}} sound. This represents the lowest point of the microphone's dynamic range, and is particularly important should you wish to record sounds that are quiet. The measure is often stated in dB(A), which is the equivalent loudness of the noise on a decibel scale frequency-weighted for how the ear hears, for example: [...] "15dBA SPL" [...] (SPL means sound pressure level relative to 20micropascals). The lower the number the better. Some microphone manufacturers state the noise level using ITU-R 468 noise weighting, which more accurately represents the way we hear noise, but gives a figure some 11–14dB higher. A quiet microphone typically measures 20dBA SPL or 32dB SPL 468-weighted. Very quiet microphones have existed for years for special applications, such the Brüel & Kjaer 4179, with a noise level around 0dB SPL. Recently some microphones with low noise specifications have been introduced in the studio/entertainment market, such as models from Neumann and Røde that advertise noise levels between 5–7dBA. Typically this is achieved by altering the frequency response of the capsule and electronics to result in lower noise within the A-weighting curve while broadband noise may be increased.|$|E

We propose several reconstruction algorithms based on the cross-power spectral densities of the network's response to the <b>input</b> <b>noises.</b> Our first algorithm reconstructs the Boolean structure (i. e., existence and directions of links) of a directed network from a series of dynamical responses. Moreover, we propose a second algorithm to recover the exact structure of the network (including edge weights), as well as the power spectral density of the <b>input</b> <b>noises,</b> when an eigenvalue-eigenvector pair of the connectivity matrix is known (for example, Laplacian connectivity matrices).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the theoretical and experimental {{study on the}} spectrogram image analysis of error signals for minimizing the impulse <b>input</b> <b>noises</b> in the active suppression of <b>noise.</b> Impulse <b>inputs</b> of some specific wave patterns as primary noises to a one-dimensional duct with the length of 1800 [*]mm are shown. The convergence speed of the adaptive feedforward algorithm based on the least mean square approach was controlled by a normalized step size which was incorporated into the algorithm. The variations of the step size govern the stability {{as well as the}} convergence speed. Because of this reason, a normalized step size is introduced as a new method for the control of impulse noise. The spectrogram images which indicate the degree of the attenuation of the impulse <b>input</b> <b>noises</b> are considered to represent the attenuation with the new method. The algorithm is extensively investigated in both simulation and real-time control experiment. It is demonstrated that the suggested algorithm worked with a nice stability and performance against impulse noises.

40|$|Two issues {{concerning}} {{the application of}} continuous attractors in neural systems are investigated: the computational robustness of continuous at-tractors with respect to <b>input</b> <b>noises</b> and the implementation of Bayesian online decoding. In a perfect mathematical model for continuous attrac-tors, decoding results for stimuli are highly sensitive to <b>input</b> <b>noises,</b> and this sensitivity is the inevitable consequence of the system’s neutral stability. To overcome this shortcoming, we modify the conventional net-work model by including extra dynamical interactions between neurons. These interactions {{vary according to the}} biologically plausible Hebbian learning rule and have the computational role of memorizing and prop-agating stimulus information accumulated with time. As a result, the new network model responds to the history of external inputs over a pe-riod of time, and hence becomes insensitive to short-term fluctuations. Also, since dynamical interactions provide a mechanism to convey the prior knowledge of stimulus, that is, the information of the stimulus pre-sented previously, the network effectively implements online Bayesian inference. This study also reveals some interesting behavior in neural population coding, such as the trade-off between decoding stability and the speed of tracking time-varying stimuli, and the relationship between neural tuning width and the tracking speed. ...|$|R

40|$|In most {{applications}} of high speed op amps, {{it is the}} total output rms noise that is generally of interest. Because of the high bandwidths involved, the chief contributor to the output rms noise is therefore the white noise, and the 1 /f noise is negligible. Typical high speed op amps have bandwidths greater than 150 MHz or so, and bipolar voltage feedback (VFB) input stages have <b>input</b> voltage <b>noises</b> ranging from about 1 to 20 nV/√Hz. For a VFB op amp, the inverting and non-inverting <b>input</b> current <b>noise</b> are typically equal, and almost always uncorrelated. Typical values for wideband VFB op amps range from 0. 5 to 5 pA/√Hz. The <b>input</b> current <b>noise</b> of a bipolar input stage is increased when input bias-current compensation generators are added, because their current noise is not correlated, and therefore adds (in a root-sum-square manner) to the intrinsic current noise of the bipolar stage. However, bias current compensation is rarely used in high speed op amps. The <b>input</b> voltage <b>noise</b> in current feedback (CFB) op amps tends to be lower than for VFB op amps having the same approximate bandwidth. This is because the input stage in a CFB op amp is usually operated at a higher current, thereby reducing the emitter resistance and hence the voltage noise. Typical values for CFB op amps range from about 1 to 5 nV/√Hz...|$|R
50|$|Both {{the pump}} power and <b>input</b> <b>noise</b> level are {{influential}} in the supercontinuum generation process, determining, e.g., the broadening factor and the onset of soliton-fission. Below the threshold for soliton fission, the soliton number generated from an average output pulse is below one, and well above threshold, it can be quite large. In the case of large pump power, soliton fission often {{has been compared to}} onset of boiling in a superheated liquid in that the transition begins rather suddenly and explosively.

50|$|The {{analogy between}} these extreme optical events and {{hydrodynamic}} rogue waves was initially developed by noting {{a number of}} parallels, including the role of solitons, heavy-tailed statistics, dispersion, modulation instability, and frequency downshifting effects. Additionally, forms of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation are used to model both optical pulse propagation in nonlinear fiber and deep water waves, including hydrodynamic rogue waves. Simulations were then conducted with the nonlinear Schrödinger equation {{in an effort to}} model the optical findings. For each trial or event, the initial conditions consisted of an input pulse and a minute amount of broadband <b>input</b> <b>noise.</b> The initial conditions (i.e., pulse power and noise level) were chosen so that the spectral broadening was relatively limited in the typical events. Collecting the results from the trials, very similar filtered energy statistics were observed compared with those seen experimentally. The simulations showed that rare events had experienced significantly more spectral broadening than the others because a soliton had been ejected in the former class of events, but not {{in the vast majority of}} events.
