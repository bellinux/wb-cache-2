5|$|The <b>English</b> <b>name</b> Octopus {{card was}} also {{selected}} from the naming competition.

25|$|English {{is taught}} {{throughout}} China's secondary {{schools and the}} English language section is a required component of the Gaokao, China's college entrance examination. Many Chinese teenagers thus acquire <b>English</b> <b>names,</b> which they may keep and use as nicknames even in Chinese-language contexts. Chinese may adopt <b>English</b> <b>names</b> {{for a variety of}} reasons, including foreigners' difficulty with Chinese tones and the modern Chinese tendency to regard foreign names as modern or egalitarian. The freedom associated with choosing a Chinese given name sometimes leads to choosing <b>English</b> <b>names</b> which seem bizarre to native <b>English</b> speakers. <b>Names</b> like Chlorophyll, Candy, Devil or Whale are pretty common, and even the real <b>English</b> <b>names</b> chosen by Chinese often tend to be rarely used by native English speakers.|$|R

5|$|The <b>English</b> <b>name</b> carbon {{comes from}} the Latin carbo for coal and charcoal, whence also comes the French charbon, meaning charcoal. In German, Dutch and Danish, the names for carbon are Kohlenstoff, koolstof and kulstof respectively, all {{literally}} meaning coal-substance.|$|E
5|$|The {{name of the}} taxonomic order, Coleoptera, {{comes from}} the Greek koleopteros (κολεόπτερος), given to the group by Aristotle for their elytra, {{hardened}} shield-like forewings, from koleos, sheath, and pteron, wing. The <b>English</b> <b>name</b> beetle comes from the Old English word bitela, little biter, related to bītan (to bite), leading to Middle English betylle. Another Old <b>English</b> <b>name</b> for beetle is ceafor, chafer, used in names such as cockchafer, from the Proto-Germanic *kabraz- (compare German Käfer).|$|E
5|$|Bolton is {{a common}} Northern <b>English</b> <b>name</b> derived from the Old English bothl-tun, meaning a {{settlement}} with a dwelling.

Their habit of wedging a large food item in a crevice and then hacking at it with their strong bills gives this group its <b>English</b> <b>name.</b>|$|E

However, partway through construction, it was forced to relinquish control to the city of Brussels after an embezzlement scandal in which a company director allegedly attempted to steal 2.5 million francs from the company. Anspach only barely kept his office in 1869 by-elections.|$|E
5|$|In 1500 polymath Leonardo da Vinci {{provides}} the first {{illustration of the}} thyroid. In 1543 Anatomist Andreas Vesalius gave the first anatomic description and illustration of the gland.

The <b>English</b> <b>name</b> thyroid gland {{is derived from the}} medical Latin used by Wharton – glandula thyreoidea. Glandula means gland in Latin, and thyreoidea {{can be traced back to}} the Ancient Greek word θυρεοειδής, meaning shield-like/shield-shaped.|$|E

5|$|The Bohemian waxwing (Bombycilla garrulus) is a starling-sized {{passerine}} {{bird that}} breeds {{in the northern}} forests of Eurasia and North America. It has mainly buff-grey plumage, black face markings and a pointed crest. Its wings are patterned with white and bright yellow, and some feather tips have the red waxy appearance that give this species its <b>English</b> <b>name.</b> The three subspecies show only minor differences in appearance. Females are similar to males, although young birds are less well-marked and have few or no waxy wingtips. Although the Bohemian waxwing's range overlaps those of the cedar and Japanese waxwings, it is easily distinguished from them by size and plumage differences.|$|E
5|$|The {{cattle egret}} was first {{described}} in 1758 by Linnaeus in his Systema naturae as Ardea ibis, but {{was moved to}} its current genus by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1855. Its genus name Bubulcus is Latin for herdsman, referring, like the <b>English</b> <b>name,</b> to this species' association with cattle. Ibis is a Latin and Greek word which originally referred to another white wading bird, the sacred ibis, but was applied to this species in error.|$|E
