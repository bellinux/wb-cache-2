40|$|Background: Since its {{founding}} in 2002, the <b>Global</b> <b>Fund</b> to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (<b>Global</b> <b>Fund)</b> has become the dominant multilateral health financier in low- and middle-income countries. The health impact of the <b>Global</b> <b>Fund</b> remains unknown because existing evaluations measure intermediate outcomes or do not account for preexisting and counterfactual trends. Methods: We conducted an econometric analysis of data from all countries eligible to receive <b>Global</b> <b>Fund</b> grants from 1995 to 2010, prior to and during the <b>Global</b> <b>Fund's</b> activities. We analyzed three outcomes: all-cause adult (15 - 59 years), all-cause under-five, and malaria-specific under-five mortality. Our main exposure was a continuous longitudinal measure of <b>Global</b> <b>Fund</b> disbursements per capita. We used panel fixed effect regressions, and analyzed mortality trends controlling for health spending, health worker density (a measure of health system capacity), gross domestic product, urbanization, and country fixed-effects. Results and discussion: We find that following <b>Global</b> <b>Fund</b> disbursements, adult mortality rate declined by 1. 4 % per year faster with every $ 10 per capita increase in disbursements (p∈=∈ 0. 005). Similarly, malaria-specific under-five mortality declined by 6. 9 % per year faster (p∈=∈ 0. 033) with every $ 10 high per capita <b>Global</b> <b>Fund</b> disbursements. However, we find no association between <b>Global</b> <b>Fund</b> support and all-cause under-five mortality. These findings were consistent after subanalyses by baseline HIV prevalence, adjusting for effects of concurrent health aid from other donors, and varying time lags between funding and mortality changes. Conclusions: Grants from the <b>Global</b> <b>Fund</b> {{are closely related to}} accelerated reductions in all-cause adult mortality and malaria-specific under-five mortality. However, up to 2010 the <b>Global</b> <b>Fund</b> has not measurably contributed to reducing all-cause under-five mortality...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Objectives The {{impact of}} donors, such as {{national}} government (bi-lateral), private sector, and individual financial (philanthropic) contributions, on domestic health policies of developing nations {{has been the}} subject of scholarly discourse. Little is known, however, about the impact of global financial initiatives, such as the <b>Global</b> <b>Fund</b> to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, on policies and health governance of countries receiving funding from such initiatives. Methods This study employs a qualitative methodological design based on a single case study: Brazil. Analysis at national, inter-governmental and community levels is based on in-depth interviews with the <b>Global</b> <b>Fund</b> and the Brazilian Ministry of Health and civil societal activists. Primary research is complemented with information from printed media, reports, journal articles, and books, which were used to deepen our analysis while providing supporting evidence. Results Our analysis suggests that in Brazil, <b>Global</b> <b>Fund</b> financing has helped to positively transform health governance at three tiers of analysis: the national-level, inter-governmental-level, and community-level. At the national-level, <b>Global</b> <b>Fund</b> financing has helped to increased political attention and commitment to relatively neglected diseases, such as tuberculosis, while harmonizing intra-bureaucratic relationships; at the inter-governmental-level, <b>Global</b> <b>Fund</b> financing has motivated the National Tuberculosis Programme to strengthen its ties with state and municipal health departments, and non-governmental organisations (NGOs); while at the community-level, the <b>Global</b> <b>Fund’s</b> financing of civil societal institutions has encouraged the emergence of new civic movements, participation, and the creation of new municipal participatory institutions designed to monitor the disbursement of <b>funds</b> for <b>Global</b> <b>Fund</b> grants. Conclusions <b>Global</b> <b>Fund</b> financing can help deepen health governance at multiple levels. Future work will need to explore how the financing of civil society by the <b>Global</b> <b>Fund</b> and other donors influence policy agenda-setting and institutional innovations for increased civic participation in health governance and accountability to citizens. </p...|$|R
