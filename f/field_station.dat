30|$|In {{order to}} manage the future smart grid in an effective, {{scalable}} and timely manner, communication with {{and control of the}} equipment located in <b>field</b> <b>stations</b> is required. This increased connectivity together with the use of third party software and protocols without security extensions poses quite a large risk to the well-operation of <b>field</b> <b>stations</b> (Oman et al. 2000). Even though the central EMS can correct (some) faulty sensor readings, the system is still at risk if, e.g., the central system is compromised and no extra security checks are performed locally at the <b>field</b> <b>stations.</b> Hence, this paper proposes to additionally secure the communication involving <b>field</b> <b>stations</b> by only using local means.|$|R

5|$|Extensions to both Metro {{lines are}} planned as of September 2017. The Blue Line {{extension}} will branch northward from the Target <b>Field</b> <b>station,</b> adding 11 stations to the line: two more in Minneapolis, two in Golden Valley, one each in Robbinsdale and Crystal, and five in Brooklyn Park. The Green Line extension will branch west from Target <b>Field</b> <b>station</b> and include 15 new stations: five in Minneapolis, three each in Saint Louis Park and Hopkins, one in Minnetonka, and three in Eden Prairie. The Metropolitan Council estimated in 2017 that the Green Line extension {{will be open}} for passenger service in 2021 and the Blue Line extension {{will be ready for}} passenger service the following year.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak's daily Empire Builder (Chicago–Seattle/Portland) train {{runs through}} Minnesota, calling at the Saint Paul Union Depot {{and five other}} stations. Intercity bus {{providers}} include Jefferson Lines, Greyhound, and Megabus. Local public transit is provided by bus networks in the larger cities and by two rail services. The Northstar Line commuter rail service runs from Big Lake to the Target <b>Field</b> <b>station</b> in downtown Minneapolis. From there, light rail runs to Saint Paul Union Depot on the Green Line, and to the MSP airport and the Mall of America via the Blue Line.|$|E
5|$|As of 2008, the Rosenstiel School {{receives}} $50million {{in annual}} external research funding. Their laboratories include a salt-water wave tank, a five-tank Conditioning and Spawning System, multi-tank Aplysia Culture Laboratory, Controlled Corals Climate Tanks, and DNA analysis equipment. The campus also houses an invertebrate museum with 400,000 specimens and operates the Bimini Biological <b>Field</b> <b>Station,</b> {{an array of}} oceanographic high-frequency radar along the US east coast, and the Bermuda aerosol observatory. UM also owns the Little Salt Spring, a site on the National Register of Historic Places, in North Port, Florida, where RSMAS performs archaeological and paleontological research.|$|E

5|$|Fares for Metro {{light rail}} service {{are the same}} as those for most Metro Transit bus {{services}} and include unlimited transfers to other light rail and bus routes within 2.5 hours from the time a fare is paid. Two exceptions exist for Metro light rail services: fares within (but not between) downtown zones are less expensive than regular fares but may not be transferred; and there is no cost to ride between terminals 1 and 2 at the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport (MSP). Many stations connect with rail or bus routes. The Target <b>Field</b> <b>station</b> provides a connection to the Northstar commuter rail line, while the Mall of America station allows for transfers to the Metro Red Line bus rapid transit service. The A Line bus rapid transit line connects with the 46th Street Blue Line station and the Snelling Avenue Green Line stop. Two Metro light rail stations – 28th Avenue and Fort Snelling – have designated park and ride lots.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{historians of}} the 18th and 19th centuries {{rejected}} stories of hermaphroditism in hyenas, and recognised {{the differences between}} the spotted and striped hyena. However, they continued to focus on the species' scavenging habits, their potential to rob graves and their perceived cowardice. During the 20th century, Western and African stereotypes of the spotted hyena converged; in both Ernest Hemingway's Green Hills of Africa and Disney's The Lion King, the traits of gluttony and comical stupidity, common in African depictions of hyenas, are added to the Western perception of hyenas being cowardly and ugly. After the release of The Lion King, hyena biologists protested against the animal's portrayal: one hyena researcher sued Disney studios for defamation of character, and another who had organized the animators' visit to the University of California's <b>Field</b> <b>Station</b> for Behavioural Research, where they would observe and sketch captive hyenas suggested boycotting the film.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} to UC Berkeley in 1936, Eakin was {{appointed}} instructor of zoology, becoming assistant professor in 1940 and full professor in 1949. He was assistant dean of the College of Letters and Science from 1940 to 1943, {{and chairman of the}} Department of Zoology from 1942 to 1948, and again from 1952 to 1957. As an administrator he helped found the university's Bodega Marine Laboratory, Sagehen Creek <b>Field</b> <b>Station,</b> and Cancer Research Genetics Laboratory. In 1956 he published a history of zoological research at Berkeley spanning the period from the university's 1868 founding through 1956, followed by a 1988 companion article covering the intervening 32 years.|$|E
30|$|Clearly, a more {{thorough}} investigation of the real-time performance is needed for different sizes of <b>field</b> <b>stations,</b> before bringing this approach to market.
