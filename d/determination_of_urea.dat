40|$|A {{simple method}} for <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>urea</b> {{in blood and}} urine with {{diacetyl}} monoxime-glucuronolactone reagent is presented. The stability of the color produced permits analysis {{of a large number}} of samples at one time. Deproteinization of blood is accom-plished with sodium tungstate and alum. N UMEROUS STUDIES have been reported in the literature on the photo-metric <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>urea</b> in biological fluids with diacetyl monoxime as the color-developing agent. The reaction is photosensitive, does not follow Beer’s law, and requires special precautions for reproducible re-sults. In many proposed procedures, oxidants were added in the reaction mixture to destroy hydroxylamine which might be generated during the reaction by the strong acidity, and decrease the produced color. The oxidants employed have included persulfuric acid (5, 8, 12, 17), arsenic acid (1, 2, 6, 10, 19, 20), perchioric acid (ii), chloramine T (9), and ferric ammonium sulfate (18). Substances other than oxidants have also been added to the reaction mixture: phenylanthranilic acid (21) and phena-zone (3) to intensify the color and, more recently, thiosemicarbazide (4) to minimize the photosensitivity of the reaction. n-Glucuronolactone or n-glucuronic amide was found, in the authors’ laboratory, to produce an intense and photostable color when added to the reaction mixture.

40|$|The rate of {{unidirectional}} [14 C]urea efflux {{from human}} red cells was determined in the self-exchange and net efflux modes with the continuous flow tube method. Self-exchange flux was saturable and followed simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics. At 38 degrees C the maximal self-exchange flux was 1. 3 X 10 (- 7) mol cm- 2 s- 1, and the urea concentration for half-maximal flux, K 1 / 2, was 396 mM. At 25 degrees C the maximal self-exchange flux decreased to 8. 2 X 10 (- 8) mol cm- 2 s- 1, and K 1 / 2 to 334 mM. The concentration-dependent urea permeability coefficient was 3 X 10 (- 4) cm s- 1 at 1 mM and 8 X 10 (- 5) cm s- 1 at 800 mM (25 degrees C). The latter value is consonant with previous volumetric <b>determinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>urea</b> permeability. Urea transport was inhibited competitively by thiourea; the half-inhibition constant, Ki, was 17 mM at 38 degrees C and 13 mM at 25 degrees C. Treatment with 1 mM p-chloromercuribenzosulfonate inhibited urea permeability by 92 %. Phloretin reduced urea permeability further (greater than 97 %) to a "ground" permeability of approximately 10 (- 6) cm s- 1 (25 degrees C). This residual permeability is {{probably due to}} urea permeating the hydrophobic core of the membrane by simple diffusion. The apparent activation energy, EA, <b>of</b> <b>urea</b> transport after maximal inhibition was 59 kJ mol- 1, whereas in control cells EA was 34 kJ mol- 1 at 1 M and 12 kJ mol- 1 at 1 mM urea. In net efflux experiments with no extracellular urea, the permeability coefficient remained constantly high, independent of a variation <b>of</b> intracellular <b>urea</b> between 1 and 500 mM, which indicates that the urea transport system is asymmetric. It is concluded that urea permeability above the ground permeability is due to facilitate diffusion and not to diffusion through nonspecific leak pathways as suggested previously...|$|R

30|$|Urea [(NH 2) 2 CO] is {{synthesized}} in {{the liver}} and is the final product of detoxification of endogenous ammonia, which is formed due to the decay of proteins and other nitrogen-containing compounds. The synthesized urea is released from the liver into the blood and transported to the kidneys where it is filtered and excreted with the urine. Normally, the urea concentration in humans ranges from 2.5 to 7.5  mM [1], but the rate of its synthesis, and thus the concentration, increase partially if either the protein-rich food is used, or endogenous catabolism is enhanced under the conditions of starvation, or the tissues are damaged, etc. However, a drastically elevated level <b>of</b> <b>urea</b> (50 – 150  mM) in the blood plasma indicates a kidney dysfunction.
