5|$|Among the Fundamental Truths was a {{statement}} regarding speaking <b>in</b> <b>tongues</b> as the initial physical evidence of Spirit baptism. Its inclusion was challenged by F.F. Bosworth, an executive presbyter, who argued that while for many speaking <b>in</b> <b>tongues</b> was an evidence of the baptism {{it was not the}} only evidence. The issue was decided at the General Council of September 1918 where Bosworth, who two months earlier had resigned so as not to damage the fellowship, was present and invited to address the council. Following debate two resolutions were passed which assured that initial evidence would remain an official teaching of the fellowship.|$|E
5|$|Later in Acts, Peter preached {{the gospel}} to the {{household}} of Cornelius the Centurion, a gentile. While he preached, the Holy Spirit {{fell on the}} gentiles, {{and they began to}} speak <b>in</b> <b>tongues.</b> The Jewish believers with Peter were amazed, and the household was water baptized. While the apostle Paul was in Ephesus, he found disciples there and discovered {{that they did not know}} of the existence of the Holy Spirit and had only received John the Baptist’s baptism. After baptizing them in Jesus’ name, Paul laid his hands on them, and they began to speak <b>in</b> <b>tongues</b> and prophesy.|$|E

5|$|Seymour and {{his small}} group of new {{followers}} soon relocated {{to the home of}} Richard and Ruth Asberry at 216 North Bonnie Brae Street. White families from local holiness churches began to attend as well. The group would get together regularly and pray to receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit. On April 9, 1906, after five weeks of Seymour's preaching and prayer, and three days into an intended 10-day fast, Edward S. Lee spoke <b>in</b> <b>tongues</b> for the first time. At the next meeting, Seymour shared Lee's testimony and preached a sermon on Acts 2:4 and soon six others began to speak <b>in</b> <b>tongues</b> as well, including Jennie Moore, who would later become Seymour's wife. A few days later, on April 12, Seymour spoke <b>in</b> <b>tongues</b> for the first time after praying all night long.|$|E

40|$|Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) arising in {{the oral}} cavity are {{associated}} with poor survival, mainly due to metastatic disease. In contrast, skin SCCs rarely metastasize and are usually curable. To study influence of tongue and skin stroma on cancer growth and induction of lymphangiogenesis, xenograft tumors of human carcinoma cells were established either <b>in</b> <b>tongue</b> or skin of BALB/c nude mice. Two oral and two skin SCC cell lines were used, {{as well as an}} endometrial adenocarcinoma cell line. Tongue tumors established from all cell lines were larger than corresponding skin tumors. Peritumoral lymphatic vessel density was up to five times higher <b>in</b> <b>tongue</b> than <b>in</b> corresponding skin tumors, and mRNA level of the lymphangiogenic growth factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) -C was twice as high <b>in</b> <b>tongue</b> tumors compared with corresponding skin tumors. Contrary to lymphatic vessel density, blood vessel density was higher in skin tumors than <b>in</b> <b>tongue</b> tumors. <b>In</b> a cohort of patient samples, lymphatic vessel density was found to be higher <b>in</b> <b>tongue</b> SCCs compared with skin SCCs, supporting a clinical relevance of our findings. Our results show that the tumor stroma has a profound impact on cancer growth and induction of lymphangiogenesis and angiogenesis. The difference in lymphatic vessel density between tongue and skin tumors may be important in directing metastatic potential of tumors arising in these organs...|$|R

Among these five groups was a quorum of twelve apostles. Smith gave a revelation saying that to redeem Zion, his followers would have to receive an endowment in the Kirtland Temple, and in March 1836, at the temple's dedication, many participants in the promised endowment saw visions of angels, spoke <b>in</b> <b>tongues,</b> and prophesied.|$|E

40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs with {{specific}} regulatory role in gene expression. Recent reports suggested {{their involvement in}} human malignancies. Currently, there is no information concerning miRNA expression and functions in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of <b>tongue.</b> <b>In</b> this study, we evaluated the expression patterns of 156 mature miRNAs <b>in</b> <b>tongue</b> SCC using Taqman-based microRNA assays. Of these 156 miRNAs, miR- 133 a and miR- 133 b were significantly reduced <b>in</b> <b>tongue</b> SCC cells <b>in</b> comparison with the paired normal epithelial cells. Tongue SCC cell lines transfected with miR- 133 a and miR- 133 b precursors displayed reduction in proliferation rate. In addition, the number of apoptotic cells was increased {{in response to the}} introduction of precursors. Computational target gene prediction suggested that both miR- 133 a and miR- 133 b are targeting transcript of pyruvate kinase type M 2 (PKM 2), a potential oncogene in solid cancers. <b>In</b> <b>tongue</b> SCC cell lines, PKM 2 expression was reduced in response to miR- 133 a and miR- 133 b precursors transfection. Immunohistochemical staining results of tongue SCC tissues suggested that PKM 2 was overexpressed <b>in</b> <b>tongue</b> SCC and was associated with the downregulation of miR- 133 a and miR- 133 b. Our results suggested that aberrant reduction of miR- 133 a and miR- 133 b was associated with the dysregulation of PKM 2 <b>in</b> SCC of <b>tongue.</b> © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|In {{classical}} Pentecostalism, the baptism {{with the}} Holy Spirit {{is understood to}} be a separate and distinct experience occurring sometime after regeneration. It is an empowering experience, equipping Spirit-filled believers for witness and ministry.

Pentecostals believe that Spirit baptism will be accompanied by the physical evidence of speaking <b>in</b> <b>tongues</b> (glossolalia).|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1890s, R.C. Horner, a Canadian holiness evangelist, {{introduced}} a theological distinction {{that would be}} important {{for the development of}} Pentecostalism. He argued in his books Pentecost (1891) and Bible Doctrines (1909) that the baptism in the Holy Spirit was not synonymous with the second blessing but was actually a third work of grace subsequent to salvation and sanctification that empowered the believer for service. Charles Fox Parham would build on this doctrinal foundation when he identified speaking <b>in</b> <b>tongues</b> as the Bible evidence of Spirit baptism.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of expiratory resistance load on the tongue area encompassing the suprahyoid and genioglossus muscles. [Subjects] The subjects were 30 healthy individuals (15 males, 15 females, mean age: 28. 9 years). [Methods] Magnetic resonance imaging was used to in-vestigate morphological changes in response to resistive expiratory pressure loading in the area encompassing the suprahyoid and genioglossus muscles. Images were taken when water pressure was sustained at 0 %, 10 %, 30 %, and 50 % of maximum resistive expiratory pressure. We then measured tongue area using image analysis software, and the morphological changes were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance followed by post hoc comparisons. [Results] A significant change <b>in</b> the <b>tongue</b> area was detected in both sexes upon loading. Multiple comparison analysis revealed further significant differences <b>in</b> <b>tongue</b> area as well as changes <b>in</b> <b>tongue</b> area <b>in</b> re-sponse to the different expiratory pressures.

5|$|Singing was {{sporadic}} and in {{a cappella}} or occasionally there would be singing <b>in</b> <b>tongues.</b> There were periods of extended silence. Attenders were occasionally slain in the Spirit. Visitors gave their testimony, and members read aloud testimonies that {{were sent to the}} mission by mail. There was prayer for the gift of tongues. There was prayer <b>in</b> <b>tongues</b> for the sick, for missionaries, and whatever requests were given by attenders or mailed in. There was spontaneous preaching and altar calls for salvation, sanctification and baptism of the Holy Spirit. Lawrence Catley, whose family attended the revival, said that in most services preaching consisted of Seymour opening a Bible and worshippers coming forward to preach or testify as they were led by the Holy Spirit. Many people would continually shout throughout the meetings. The members of the mission never took an offering, but there was a receptacle near the door for anyone that wanted to support the revival. The core membership of the Azusa Street Mission was never much more than 50–60 individuals with hundreds and thousands of people visiting or staying temporarily over the years.|$|E

5|$|After Charles Parham began {{promoting}} {{the idea that}} speaking <b>in</b> <b>tongues</b> was the initial evidence of the baptism in the Spirit around 1901, he began to attract a considerable following which he organized loosely as the Apostolic Faith Movement (AFM) in 1906. However, {{with the rise of}} the Azusa Street Revival in Los Angeles, California, and an accusation of sodomy against him in 1907, he lost and never recovered his influence. After renouncing Parham, the severely weakened AFM regrouped around Howard A. Goss, L. C. Hall, D. C. O. Opperman, and A. G. Canada. They were later joined by Eudorus N. Bell, previously a Southern Baptist minister. The AFM had its strength in the rural areas of Kansas, Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAlthough {{canonical}} Wnt signaling {{is known}} to regulate taste papilla induction and numbers, roles for noncanonical Wnt pathways <b>in</b> <b>tongue</b> and taste papilla development have not been explored. With mutant mice and whole tongue organ cultures we demonstrate that Wnt 5 a protein and message are within anterior tongue mesenchyme across embryo stages from the initiation of tongue formation, through papilla placode appearance and taste papilla development. The Wnt 5 a mutant tongue is severely shortened, with an ankyloglossia, and lingual mesenchyme is disorganized. However, fungiform papilla morphology, number and innervation are preserved, as is expression of the papilla marker, Shh. These data demonstrate that the genetic regulation for tongue size and shape can be separated from that directing lingual papilla development. Preserved number of papillae <b>in</b> a shortened <b>tongue</b> results <b>in</b> an increased density of fungiform papillae <b>in</b> the mutant <b>tongues.</b> <b>In</b> <b>tongue</b> organ cultures, exogenous Wnt 5 a profoundly suppresses papilla formation and simultaneously decreases canonical Wnt signaling {{as measured by the}} TOPGAL reporter. These findings suggest that Wnt 5 a antagonizes canonical Wnt signaling to dictate papilla number and spacing. In all, distinctive roles for Wnt 5 a <b>in</b> <b>tongue</b> size, fungiform papilla patterning and development are shown and a necessary balance between non-canonical and canonical Wnt paths <b>in</b> regulating <b>tongue</b> growth and fungiform papillae is proposed in a model, through the Ror 2 receptor...|$|R

On the following Sunday, March 4, he returned to the church and found that Hutchins had padlocked the door. Elders of the church rejected Seymour's teaching, primarily because he had not yet experienced the blessing about which he was preaching. Condemnation of his message also came from the Holiness Church Association of Southern California with which the church had affiliation. However, not all members of Hutchins' church rejected Seymour's preaching. He was invited to stay in the home of congregation member Edward S.
