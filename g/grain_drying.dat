40|$|Grain {{yields of}} wheat (Triticum aestivitm L) are {{influenced}} partly by final <b>grain</b> <b>dry</b> weight, which is largely {{determined by the}} rate and duration of the grain filling process. A study was undertaken to compare the observed final <b>grain</b> <b>dry</b> weight of five groups of wheat genotypes differing in earliness (extra early, medium early, medium late, late and a control group of high yielding NS cultivars) with the observed duration and average and maximum rates of grain filling in two different environments. Correlation coefficients {{were used to determine}} which grain filling parameter had more influence on final <b>grain</b> <b>dry</b> weight, in an environment common for our country (2002), final <b>grain</b> <b>dry</b> weight was strongly positively correlated with the average and maximum rates and strongly negatively correlated with the duration of grain filling. The medium late and control groups had the highest final <b>grain</b> <b>dry</b> weights. Correlations between final <b>grain</b> <b>dry</b> weight and the duration and average rate of grain filling were positive in an unfavorable environment (2001). The NS cultivars and extra early genotypes had the highest final grain dry-weights. The rate and duration of grain filling are usually negatively correlated. The influence of grain filling parameters on final <b>grain</b> <b>dry</b> weight is not the same in different environments, so the ability of the genotype to compensate for the low grain filling rate with grain fill prolongation in unfavorable environments might be more important. The observed average grain filling rate is probably more important as a parameter for describing these processes than the maximum one...|$|R

30|$|Grain {{production}} {{per unit}} area (filled <b>grain</b> <b>dry</b> weight per square meter) in GH significantly increased in the presence of qTSN 4 for both genetic backgrounds (Table  2).

40|$|Heat stress {{effects on}} <b>grain</b> <b>dry</b> mass and quality were studied in spring wheat genotypes (Triticum aestivum L.). Three cultivars were chosen {{with respect to}} heat tolerance: Lavett (genotype 1), {{selected}} for temperate growing conditions and two CIMMYT cultivars, Ciano- 79 (genotype 2) and Attila (genotype 3), respectively heat sensitive and heat tolerant varieties for warm environments. Plants were grown in pots at two different day/night temperatures (18 / 13 and 25 / 20 °C) in climate-controlled glasshouses and exposed to a 3 -day heat shock during the grain-filling phase. To investigate its effect on quality and yield the following traits were included: <b>grain</b> <b>dry</b> mass, flour protein concentration, glutenin macro polymer (GMP) fraction, glutenin particle size, and particle size distribution. The magnitude in which a heat shock during grain filling affects quality and yield depends on the heat tolerance of genotypes and the preceding ambient growth temperature. As expected, the responses to heat varied between and within genotypes; {{on the one hand}} <b>grain</b> size and <b>dry</b> mass decreased, on the other hand, protein related traits were improved. In genotype 1 (Lavett) a negative correlation was found between flour protein concentration and <b>grain</b> <b>dry</b> mass. However, in genotype 3 (Attila) flour protein concentration remained quite stable under a wide range of <b>grain</b> <b>dry</b> mass in response to the treatments. Genotype 2 (Ciano- 79) showed an intermediate response. These big differences in genotypic response do have a potential significant impact for maintaining quality under adverse conditions. In all genotypes the effect of heat stress was larger when plants were grown at 18 / 13 °C compared to 25 / 20 °C; especially, <b>grain</b> <b>dry</b> mass was decreased while flour protein and GMP protein fraction, GMP quantity, as well as particle size were significantly increased. The results show that genetic differences in stability of quality and yield in wheat under heat stress can be induced by a short heat-shock treatment during the grain-filling phase. It is concluded that an evaluation of quality and yield responses of wheat genotypes to short spells of heat, could considerably be improved by a heat-shock treatment during the early grain-filling phas...|$|R

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} Ames, Iowa, USA, to compare dry matter accumulation patterns of maize genotypes contrasting in height and leafiness, and to test whether reduction in plant height an leaf number {{through the use of}} dwarfing genes or earliness can improve <b>grain</b> <b>dry</b> matter allocation. Five plant genotypes were tested: a full season hybrid adapted to central lowa (NK 4525), a short season hybrid adapted to northern Minnesota (C 1070), and three dwarf lines (156 -A, 302 -E and I 17 - A). The dwarves contained, respectively, the homozygous, independent, recessive dwarfing genes d 3, d 1 and br 2. Each genotype was sown at four plant populations: 25, 50, 75 and 100. 000 plants. ha- 1. Hybrids had the greatest rates of decrease in total biomass and <b>grain</b> <b>dry</b> matter per plant when population was increased, though they also had larger absolute values of these variables at any given density.

40|$|The protein {{patterns}} of albumin, globulin, prolamin and glutelin fractions extracted from <b>dry</b> <b>grains</b> of rice (Oryza sativa L. CV.

The globulin fraction contained several bands, while the glutelin fraction resolved into two major bands and few minor bands. Also, two glycoprotein bands were detected in the glutelin fraction. <b>Grains</b> <b>dry</b> weight declined linearly throughout the germination period. Starch content decreased at a linear rate in the first 9 days and more rapidly thereafter. A study {{was made of the}} biochemical changes taking place during germination of grains over a period of II days. The grains contain a high amount of reserve starch, which made up about 50 % of <b>grain</b> <b>dry</b> weight, and a Iow amount of SDS-extracted protein that made up 2 % of <b>grain</b> <b>dry</b> weight. The electrophoretic pattern changes of protein during germination showed that protein components differ with respect to the rate of protein hydrolysis. Ungerminated grains had no invertase activity and a Iow level of total amylase activity. Amylase activity increased rapidly during germination reaching a maximum of 30 -fold in day 11.

50|$|<b>Grain</b> <b>drying</b> is {{an active}} area of {{manufacturing}} and research. The performance of a dryer can be simulated with computer programs based on mathematical models that represent the phenomena involved in drying: physics, physical chemistry, thermodynamics and heat and mass transfer.

50|$|Heated air {{may be used}} in <b>grain</b> <b>drying</b> process. It can {{not only}} {{accelerate}} moisture migration inside the kernel, but also can evaporate the moisture on the surface. The major problem about heated air for drying process is the kernel temperature. The grain kernel may be damaged by high kernel temperatures. Usually, kernel temperature is lower than the air temperature.For different use of the corn, temperatures vary. For example, for seed corn, the maximum temperature is 110 °F; for livestock feeding corn, the maximum temperature is 180 °F.|$|E
