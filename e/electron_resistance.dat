A coupled computational fluid dynamics approach based on the finite element method, in three-dimensions, is used to illustrate a planar intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cell. Governing equations for momentum, gas-phase species, heat, electron and ion transport are implemented and coupled to kinetics describing electrochemical reactions. Three different cell designs are compared in a parametric study. The importance of the cathode support layer is revealed, because this layer significantly decreases the oxygen gas-phase resistance within the cathode (at positions under the interconnect ribs) in the direction normal to the cathode/electrolyte interface {{as well as the}} <b>electron</b> <b>resistance</b> inside the cathode (at positions under the air channel) in the same direction.

40|$|A solid {{carbon-based}} composite electrode {{made from}} charcoal powder and nafion binder {{has been developed}} with potential application of storage of hydrogen electrochemically that could be utilised in fuel cells for remote area power supply. The developed electrode could be employed to store energy generated by inherently variable renewable sources and hence could act as a continuous power supply source. Such potential candidate electrode, particularly for fuel cell applications, should be both proton and electron conductive. Proton conductivity of the composite electrode was calculated from the measured proton resistance towards the flow of current using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Electron conductivity was calculated from the separately measured <b>electron</b> <b>resistance</b> using a standard ohm-meter or multi-meter. The effect of change in humidity on proton and electron conductivity of the composite electrode was examined. The carbon used was a common form of charcoal powder.

Proton conductivities in the range of 0. 015 - 0. 043 S/cm were recorded, while the electron conductivities were in the range of 5. 79 – 6. 45 S/cm.

40|$|Interfacial {{interactions}} between immobilized DNA probes and DNA-specific sequence binding drugs were investigated using impedance spectroscopy toward {{the development of}} a novel biosensing scheme. The impedance measurements are based on the charge-transfer kinetics of the [Fe(CN) 6] 3 -/ 4 - redox couple. Compared to bare gold surfaces, the immobilization of DNA and then the DNA-drug interaction on electrode surfaces altered the capacitance and the interfacial <b>electron</b> <b>resistance</b> and thus diminished the charge-transfer kinetics by reducing the active area of the electrode or by preventing the redox species from approaching the electrode. Electrochemical deposition of gold nanoparticles on a gold electrode surface showed significant improvement in sensitivity. DNA-capped gold nanoparticles on electrodes act as selective sensing interfaces with tunable sensitivity due to higher amounts of DNA probes and the concentric orientation of the DNA self-assembled monolayer. The specificity of the interactions of two classical minor groove binders, mythramycin, a G-C specific-DNA binding anticancer drug, netropsin, an A-T specific-DNA binding drug and an intercalator, nogalamycin on AT-rich DNA-modified substrate and GC-rich DNA-modified substrate are compared. Using gold nanoparticle-deposited substrates, impedance spectroscopy resulted in a 20 - 40 -fold increase in the detection limit. Arrays of deposited gold nanoparticles on gold electrodes offered a convenient tool to subtly control probe immobilization to ensure suitably adsorbed DNA orientation and accessibility of other binding molecules.

40|$|A simple photoelectrochemical {{method is}} {{developed}} {{to measure the}} intrinsic <b>electron</b> transport <b>resistance</b> (R 0) of TiO 2 photoanodes. R 0 is considered as the sum of <b>electron</b> transport <b>resistance</b> at the TiO 2 /FTO interface and among TiO 2 nanoparticulates during electron transport process, which is independent of the manner of electron injection, its physical and chemical environments. Because TiO 2 photoanodes are the common electron transport pathways for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) process and the photoelectrocatalytic oxidation process, R 0 can be also considered as a quantitative measure of the <b>electron</b> transport <b>resistance</b> of the photoanodes in the DSSC process. The proposed method will provide a simple and rapid alternative to quantitatively evaluate {{the quality of the}} TiO 2 photoanodes for DSSCs using R 0 values. A series of TiO 2 /FTO photoanodes with different <b>electron</b> transport <b>resistance</b> were fabricated using conventional screen-printing technique, surface modifications using titanium organic sol and TiCl 4 aqueous solution. R 0 values of the photoanodes were characterized and subsequently used to correlate with the important performance parameters of the corresponding DSSCs. The preliminary results suggest that these surface modifications do not significantly affect the surface area, film thickness, dye loading and optical properties of the TiO 2 film, but significantly decrease the R 0 values. Furthermore, the DSSCs photoanodes with lower R 0 values due to the organic sol or TiCl 4 modification bestow better photovoltaic performance than the corresponding non-modified photoanodes. Therefore, it can be concluded that the performance improvements were mainly attributed to the decrease of the R 0 values, which validates the proposed electrochemical evaluation method.

In this work, we suggested that citrate-capped Au/Ag NPs {{could be used}} as the reporters for the design of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) sensors with a simple manipulation principle and an easy detection procedure. Specifically, p-benzenediboronic acid (BDBA) induced the aggregation of citrate-capped Au NPs through the cross-linking reaction between citrate and boronic acid of BDBA in solution. By modifying the electrode with a boronic acid derivative, the BDBA-induced assembly of Au NPs was achieved on the electrode surface. This led to a significant decrease in the <b>electron</b> transfer <b>resistance</b> due to the unique conductive ability of Au NPs. However, when the boronate group on the electrode surface was oxidized into its phenol format, the assembly of Au NPs on the electrode surface was not achieved. As a result, a higher <b>electron</b> transfer <b>resistance</b> was observed. The process could be monitored by electrochemical impedance technique. Furthermore, when Ag NPs were used instead of Au NPs in this design, the H 2 O 2 concentration could be determined by measuring the linear-sweep voltammetry (LSV) current through the solid-state Ag/AgCl reaction of Ag NPs. The results indicated that NP-based colorimetric assays could be developed into more sensitive electrochemical analysis...|$|R

The model cell design {{is based on a}} cell from Ningbo Institute of Material Technology and Engineering in China and the electrochemical area-to-volume ratios are based on experimental work performed at Kyushu University in Japan. A parameter study is performed focusing on the inlet fuel composition, where humidified hydrogen, 30 % pre-reformed natural gas (as defined by IEA) and 50 % pre-reformed natural gas (as defined by Kyushu University) are compared. It is found that when 30 % pre-reformed natural gas is supplied as fuel the air mass flow rate is halved, compared to the case with humidified hydrogen, keeping the inlet and outlet temperatures constant.

40|$|Systematic {{studies have}} been done to develop a low cost, environmental-friendly facile {{fabrication}} process for the preparation of high performance nanostructured electrode materials and to fully understand the influence factors on the electrochemical performance in the application of lithium ion batteries (LIBs) or supercapacitors. For LIBs, LiNi 1 / 3 Co 1 / 3 Mn 1 / 3 O 2 (NCM) with a 1 D porous structure has been developed as cathode material. The tube-like 1 D structure consists of inter-linked, multi-facet nanoparticles of approximately 100 - 500 nm in diameter. The microscopically porous structure originates from the honeycomb-shaped precursor foaming gel, which serves as self-template during the stepwise calcination process. The 1 D NCM presents specific capacities of 153, 140, 130 and 118 mAh⋅g- 1 at current densities of 0. 1 C, 0. 5 C, 1 C and 2 C, respectively [...] Subsequently, a novel stepwise crystallization process consisting of a higher crystallization temperature and longer period for grain growth is employed to prepare single crystal NCM nanoparticles. The modified sol-gel process followed by optimized crystallization process results in significant improvements in chemical and physical characteristics of the NCM particles. They include a fully-developed single crystal NCM with uniform composition and a porous NCM architecture with a reduced degree of fusion and a large specific surface area. The NCM cathode material with these structural modifications in turn presents significantly enhanced specific capacities of 173. 9, 166. 9, 158. 3 and 142. 3 mAh⋅g- 1 at 0. 1 C, 0. 5 C, 1 C and 2 C, respectively. Carbon nanotube (CNT) is used to improve the relative low power capability and poor cyclic stability of NCM caused by its poor electrical conductivity. The NCM/CNT nanocomposites cathodes are prepared through simply mixing of the two component materials followed by a thermal treatment. The CNTs were functionalized to obtain uniformly-dispersed MWCNTs in the NCM matrix. The electrochemical tests found reduced inner <b>electron</b> <b>resistance</b> and improved rate capability of the nanocomposite cathodes compared to the neat NCM, which were attributed to the 3 D spatial conductive network formed by MWCNTs and Super p carbon black in the nanocomposites. The capacity retention ratios after 100 cycles of Li/NCM-CNTs cell were about 81 %, much higher than that of Li/NCM cell (~ 72 %). As for supercapacitor, the annealed GO/CNT films or papers the binder-free electrodes are prepared and use for high performance supercapacitors. The amphiphilic nature of graphene oxide (GO) sheets allows adsorption of CNTs onto their surface in water, capable of forming highly stable dispersion. Thus, the GO/CNT hybrid films or papers are self-assembled via simple casting or vacuum filtration of aqueous dispersion. The hybrid thin film electrode with a moderate CNT content, typically 12. 5 wt%, give rise to remarkable electrochemical performance with extremely high specific capacitances of 428 and 145 F⋅g- 1 at current densities of 0. 5 and 100 A⋅g- 1, respectively, as well as a remarkable retention rate 98 % of the initial value after 10, 000 charge/discharge cycles. The same as film type electrode, the rGO/CNT sandwich papers gives rise to an excellent specific capacitance of 151 F⋅g- 1 at a current density of 0. 5 A⋅g- 1, as well as a remarkable retention ratio of 86 % of the initial value after 6, 000 charge/discharge cycles at 5 A⋅g- 1. These improvements arise from the synergistic effects of the increased electronic conductivity and effective surface area associated with large electrochemical active sites. The synergistic effects arising from i) the enlarged surface area of electrodes due to the intercalation of CNTs between the stacked GO sheets with associated large electrochemical active sites and ii) the improved conductivity through the formation of 3 D network aided by CNTs, are mainly responsible for these findings. The effects of reduction process are also studied on the supercapacitive behavior of electrodes made from flexible graphene oxide (GO) papers. It is found that the supercapacitive performance depends on several factors, including the presence of oxygenated functional groups after reuction, the interlayer spacing of GO papers and the wettability with electrolyte. A moderate reduction of GO papers using hydrazine or annealing at a low temperature, say 220 °C, in air is proven to be more beneficial to achiving a high capacitance than the heavy reduction using a hydrazine vapor or a high temperature thermal treatment...|$|E

Electrochemical immunosensor for the determination of Aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) was developed with anti-aflatoxin B 1 antibody immobilized on Pt electrodes modified with polyaniline (PANi) and polystyrene sulphonic acid (PSSA). Impedimetric analysis shows that the <b>electron</b> transfer <b>resistances</b> of Pt/PANi-PSSA electrode, Pt/PANi-PSSA/AFB 1 -Ab immunosensor and Pt/PANi-PSSA/AFB 1 -Ab incubated in BSA were 0. 458, 720 and 1066 kΩ, respectively.

Figure  4 b presents the Nyquist plots of the five DSCs in the frequency range of 105 – 10 − 1  Hz under the dark at − 0.7  V. Normally, three semi-circles appear in the Nyquist plots from the left to the right with decreasing frequencies, which correspond to the reduction at the counter electrode (105 – 103  Hz range), <b>electron</b> recombination <b>resistance</b> at the photoanode (103 – 1  Hz range), and Nernst diffusion in the electrolyte (1 – 10 − 1  Hz range) [29]. However, in this study, only two semi-circles appeared because the electrolyte impedance was overlapped with the <b>electron</b> recombination <b>resistance</b> of the photoanode due to the relatively fast electron diffusion through the 30 -μm-gap-distance electrolyte [30]. The second semi-circle expanded when the ZNL was applied, demonstrating that the recombination resistance of the photoanode increased [30 – 32]. The higher recombination resistance signifies that the photo-generated electrons can diffuse for a longer time prior to trapping or charge recombination. Thinner nanoparticulate TiO 2 films [33, 34] and ZnO NR-embedded TiO 2 film [30] can lead to lower surface state traps and thus a lower probability of electron recombination. As the cells with the ZNL have a thinner TiO 2 film along with the ZnO NRs on top, they are beneficial for reducing the electron recombination.|$|R

Different graphene platforms were modified with hairpin-DNA (hpDNA) probes for the sensitive detection of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) correlated with the development of Alzheimer’s disease. The negatively charged hpDNA probes were immobilized on the graphene and caused an increase in <b>electron</b> transfer <b>resistance.</b> After hybridization with wide type target, the <b>electron</b> transfer <b>resistance</b> decreased due to the partial release of the hpDNA probes from the electrode surface.

The heterogeneous electron transfer rate and <b>electron</b> transfer <b>resistance</b> of the fabricated electrode were improved. The electrode overpotential has shown improvement by 50 mV, and the effective surface area has increased by 2 fold. To determine the practicability of the AuNPs/graphite electrode, we used the electrode {{in the analysis of}} myricetin. A square- wave voltammetry was used in the analysis, and the detection response increased by 2. 5 fold, which suggested an improvement in the electrode sensitivity...|$|R
30|$|An {{estimate}} of the resistance in semi-metallic HgCdTe quantum well used as a channel of THz hot-electron bolometer shows that at high <b>electron</b> concentration this <b>resistance</b> is much smaller than 1  kΩ. This resistance is 1 – 2 orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding resistances in graphene channels [where the typical resistance is {{of the order of}} 10  kΩ (Du et al. 2014; Farmer et al. 2009)]. Thus, HgCdTe channels produce smaller thermal noise and, compared to graphene, can provide more efficient coupling to planar antennas in hot-electron bolometer applications.|$|R

40|$|My {{tutorial}} {{will review}} four important phenomena of spinelectronics {{and some of}} the models which are used to describe these phenomena. The outline of the tutorial will be as follow: I) Giant Magnetoresistance in metallic multilayers:-Introduction, spin-dependent scattering, simple picture with resistance model: Giant magnetoresistance (GMR) was discovered in 1988 [1]. Very quickly, it was understood that GMR originates from spin-dependent scattering due to different density of states at Fermi levels for spin up and spin down <b>electrons.</b> A simple <b>resistance</b> model based on Mott’s two-current model wa...|$|R
40|$|The {{deposition}} of ferromagnetic microstructures {{on top of}} a high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas (2 DEG) allows the investigation of electron transport in a periodic magnetic field which alternates on a length scale small compared to the elastic mean free path of the <b>electrons.</b> The longitudinal <b>resistance</b> of the 2 DEG displays, {{as a function of the}} externally applied field, the long-predicted magnetic commensurability oscillations which result from the interplay between the two characteristic length scales of the system, the classical cyclotron radius Rc of the electrons and the period a of the magnetic field modulation...|$|R
