40|$|The {{presence}} of chrome in electric arc furnaces smelting platinum group metals (PGM's) {{has a number}} of potentially negative consequences. In cases where the slag chrome content is above the saturation limit the existence of near-stagnant conditions near the slag/matte interface increases the risk of chromite spinels settling and consolidating into a "mushy layer", a three-phase suspension of slag, chromite and matte. The hold-up of matte above the elevation of the slag/matte interface can lead to the attack of freeze linings and copper cooling elements potentially causing failures of the furnace lining and significant downtimes as well as major safety risks. This paper investigates the relationship between typical furnace operating parameters and the behavior of the slag bath with respect to the formation of the "mushy" layer at the slag/matte interface using computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

Appropriate briquetting parameters like molasses and lime binder level, molasses quality, particle size dis-tribution and segment condition etc. are essential to guarantee quality briquettes in the successful use of bri-quette and chromite ore fines. In developing a technology for briquetting of chromite ores, it is important not only to study the grain size characteristics of the chrome ore fines but also to make an informed choice of the type and quality of the bind-er and the condition for producing a physically and chemically competent green and cured briquette. This paper also describes the effect of strength of briquettes on various parameters of charge chrome pro-duction as the use of quality briquettes in the production of high carbon ferrochrome alloys has a number of operational, metallurgical and economic advantages.

This work evaluates {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of plasma systems by reviewing plasma generators, their integration with reactors and the process economics. Many plasma systems were shown to be technically and economically superior to existing technologies, but some of the plasma system advantages quoted in the literature were found to be impractical because of other system constraints. Process applications were limited by the power inputs available from plasma generators compared to AC electric furnaces. A series of trials were conducted where chromite and steelplant baghouse dusts were smelted in the Tetronics' 2. 0 MW transferred arc/open bath reactor to confirm the operating characteristics of the plasma system and its economics. Chromite smelting was technical superior to submerged arc furnace technology, but the economics were unfavourable because of the limited power available from the water-cooled plasma torch and the high electrical energy consumption. A DC graphite <b>electrode</b> plasma <b>furnace</b> using preheated and prereduced chromite concentrates will compete economically with the submerged arc furnace. Ni, Cr and Mo were economically recovered from high alloy content steelplant dusts for recycling. Five Electric Arc Furnace dusts were smelted to produce a non-toxic residue and recover the contained zinc to an enriched zinc oxide product for recycling. It should be possible to condense the zinc vapour directly in a zinc splash condenser to increase the value of the product.

40|$|We {{focus on}} the issue of outlier {{detection}} for time-series data in a process control system (PCS), since outlier detection is a critical step before performing data-based system analysis. Several published articles have proved that a wavelet transform (WT) technique can be used to detect outliers in time-series data, but the standard WT detection method, as well as any other univariate outlier detection technique, does not distinguish between the sudden change caused by the changes of inputs and the fluctuations caused by outliers in PCS. In order to improve this shortcoming of the conventional WT method for the data in a PCS, a new algorithm combining the wavelet technique with a robust radial basis function (RBF) network is proposed here. In this method, a robust RBF network (RBFN) training algorithm is proposed, which can train the RBFN online using the original data as a training set without the need of clean data and thus fits the application of online detection.

40|$|Elkem has got {{smelting}} plants worldwide. Five of {{them are}} located in Norway. Smelting of metal takes place in electrical arc furnaces, for example, in Elkem Thamshavn. The electrical arc occurs between <b>furnace</b> <b>electrodes</b> and <b>furnace</b> charge. Thereby it causes a melting (Schei, Tuset, & Tveit, 1998), (Elkem AS, 2016 a). Elkem smelting plants have many working areas with potential hazards related to the personnel which refer to current, high temperatures, amount of energy concentrations etc. Due to its industry specialty, smelting industry needs tailored standards. Therefore, a need {{for the implementation of}} the methodology appeared. It should identify critical areas that could be a starting point {{in the development of a}} standard. The assessment of working areas’ criticality regarding to low voltage will be in focus in this thesis. Identification of such critical areas is an important task, since management can prioritize the areas that have been identified (Aven, 2009). A common definition of criticality is following (Aven, 2009, p. 404) : “A system is considered critical if its failure or malfunctions may results in severe consequences”. The consequences can involve environmental damage, loss of lives, etc. By identification of critical areas it can be identified how one can distribute resources and activities concerning investments in safety and risk reducing measures (Aven, 2009). What kind of tool will be the best to use in this case? Is it the best to use methods that are well established as, for example, risk matrix or is it more useful to introduce other tools? The selection of methods in many cases depends on the available historical data. By using the available data, the following sources were found: -	Information from external sources, for instance, Accident statistic from Norwegian Directorate for Civil Protection [DSB] did not contain required information. -	Data from internal sources, as Synergi Life database, were limited. Risk matrix is a widespread tool in many companies and it is used for qualitative risk assessment. However, it is a tool with limitations (Flage & Røed, 2012). Issues related to the risk matrix, among other things are the subjective classification of the probability and consequence, the consistency between quantitative measures and risk matrix, etc. Thus, risk matrix is used to performing a crude risk analysis and cannot be used alone for decision-making. It is questionable whether this method will be the best option for smelting industry. Thus, an alternative approach may be suggested. It is related to expected values and uncertainties in underlying phenomena and processes (Aven, 2009). This alternative approach does not need a large amount of data and can be applied for ranking a few areas. For instance, it could be used to identify top five most critical working areas. Using of this ranking tool requires high knowledge related to smelting plants and the actual process. It is clear, that by including the uncertainty in the assessment of criticality the accuracy of the results will be higher. Nevertheless, the approach suggested by Aven (2009) needs some adjustments before it can be used in practice. For instance, when different areas have the same type of consequences but probabilities P (A) is different or when some areas have the same type of uncertainties but different probabilities. In such cases, there is not a straight way forward how to rank the actual areas. In addition, the alternative method for identification of critical areas was introduced in 2009. Since then there have been new studies related to this approach. Goerlandt and Reniers (2015) introduce how the assessment of uncertainties can be improved. Moreover, Aven (2013) showed the different new risk perspectives, inter alia, uncertainties based risk definitions in real-life situations. The risk description done in this way has a great impact on risk management and decision-making (Aven, 2009). In light of new research the alternative approach could be modified. The suggested improvement are as following: -	Insert the colors for assessment of risk indices expressing the expected consequences. -	Use the improved classification scheme for uncertainties. -	Include the assessment of knowledge in risk assessment. Since the focus was to develop a method for identifying the critical areas for own workers and contractors, the results will be hypothetical...|$|R

The investigations have been concerned with the associated metallurgical effects making use of a gas-tight 150 -kg arc furnace operated with two AC plasma torches. The test runs with bored graphite electrode in DC-mode with a bottom <b>electrode</b> in this <b>furnace</b> confirmed the power increase observed during methane injection. The carburization slowly occurring when 6 % CH 4 was injected into the argon atmosphere of the furnace could be avoided by adding minor amounts of CO 2. A slag layer decreased mass transfer rates without noticeably affecting heat transfer. Manganese loss by evaporation was measured to investigate the influence of power increase and slag layers. From the results, an increase of 200 K was concluded for the melt surface temperature when CH 4 was added to pure argon. Methane injection into the arcs proved to accelerate nitrogen removal considerably. Starting with an intentionally high nitrogen content of about 200 ppm, the nitrogen removal rate was found to be slowest with pure argon plasma arcs, faster with 90 % Ar + 10 % H 2, and the fastest with 95 % Ar + 5 % CH 4 reaching final contents of less than 20 ppm of nitrogen. Based on thermodynamic calculations, the denitrogenation reactions appear to take place via atomic nitrogen in pure argon plasma, via NH 3 in Ar + H 2 and via HCN in Ar + CH 4.

40|$|The Graphite <b>Electrode</b> DC Arc <b>Furnace</b> (DC Arc) is a {{high-temperature}} thermal process, {{which has}} been adapted from a commercial technology, {{for the treatment of}} mixed waste. A DC Arc Furnace heats waste to a temperature such that the waste is converted into a molten form that cools into a stable glassy and/or crystalline waste form. Hazardous organics are destroyed through combustion or pyrolysis during the process and the majority of the hazardous metals and radioactive components are incorporated in the molten phase. The DC Arc Furnace chamber temperature is approximately 593 [...] 704 C and melt temperatures are as high as 1, 500 C. The DC Arc system has an air pollution control system (APCS) to remove particulate and volatiles from the offgas. The advantage of the DC Arc {{is that it is a}} single, high-temperature thermal process that minimizes the need for multiple treatment systems and for extensive sorting/segregating of large volumes of waste. The DC Arc has the potential to treat a wide range of wastes, minimize the need for sorting, reduce the final waste volumes, produce a leach resistant waste form, and destroy organic contaminants. Although the DC arc plasma furnace exhibits great promise for treating the types of mixed waste that are commonly present at many DOE sites, several data and technology deficiencies were identified by the Mixed Waste Focus Area (MWFA) regarding this thermal waste processing technique. The technology deficiencies that have been addressed by the current studies include: establishing the partitioning behavior of radionuclides, surrogates, and hazardous metals among the product streams (metal, slag, and offgas) as a function of operating parameters, including melt temperature, plenum atmosphere, organic loading, chloride concentration, and particle size; demonstrating the efficacy of waste product removal systems for slag and metal phases; determining component durability through test runs of extended duration, evaluating the effect of feed composition variations on process operating conditions and slag product performance; and collecting mass balance and operating data to support equipment and instrument design...|$|R
