500|$|In 1911, Tolkien went on {{a summer}} holiday in Switzerland, a trip that he recollects vividly in a 1968 letter, noting that Bilbo's journey across the Misty Mountains ("including the <b>glissade</b> down the slithering stones into the pine woods") is {{directly}} based on his adventures as their party of 12 hiked from Interlaken to Lauterbrunnen and on to camp in the moraines [...] beyond Mürren. Fifty-seven years later, Tolkien remembered his regret at leaving {{the view of the}} eternal snows of Jungfrau and Silberhorn, [...] "the Silvertine (Celebdil) of my dreams". They went across the Kleine Scheidegg to Grindelwald and on across the Grosse Scheidegg to Meiringen. They continued across the Grimsel Pass, through the upper Valais to Brig and on to the Aletsch glacier and Zermatt.|$|E

40|$|Human saccadic eye {{movements}} have {{three types of}} overshoot: dynamic overshoot, lasting 10 - 30 ms; glissadic overshoot, lasting 30 - 500 ms; and static overshoot, which is amended-after a delay of about 200 ms-by a subsequent corrective saccade. <b>Glissades</b> are the slow drifting eye movements occasionally seen {{at the end of}} saccadic eye movements. <b>Glissades</b> are hypothecated to be produced by mismatches in the pulse and step components of the motoneuronal controller signals. <b>Glissades</b> are not vergence eye movements, although the dynamics are similar...|$|R
50|$|<b>Glissading</b> is {{the act of}} {{descending}} a steep snow- or scree-covered slope via {{a controlled}} slide on one's feet or buttocks. It is an alternative to other descent methods such as plunge stepping, and {{may be used to}} expedite a descent, or simply for the thrill. <b>Glissading</b> involves higher risks of injuries than other forms of descending.|$|R
5000|$|After the Games, Le Gougne wrote a {{book about}} her experiences, <b>Glissades</b> à Salt Lake City (...) [...]|$|R
60|$|It {{ought to}} be told that Butterface had {{suffered}} rather severely in the recent <b>glissade</b> on the snow-slope, which will account for the gloomy view he took of the future at that time.|$|E
60|$|They {{began with}} a <b>glissade.</b> A very steep snow-slope {{happened}} to be close at hand. It stretched uninterruptedly down several hundred feet {{to one of the}} terraces, into which the precipitous mountainside at that place was cut.|$|E
60|$|Thus commanded, Lewis obeyed, {{and found}} that the snow was indeed knee-deep, {{and that there was no}} {{possibility}} of their either slipping or falling, unless one were unusually careless, and even in that case the soft snow would have checked anything like an involuntary <b>glissade.</b>|$|E
60|$|For {{the first}} time in his life Lewisham faced the {{necessity}} of telling a lie in cold blood. He <b>glissaded</b> from, the austere altitudes of his self-respect, and his next words were already disingenuous.|$|R
40|$|<b>Glissades</b> are the slow, gliding eye {{movements}} often appended {{to the end}} {{of human}} saccadic eye movements. They have been used as an aid in diagnosing disease states, eg, multiple sclerosis and vascular lesions. <b>Glissades</b> are a consequence of a mismatch between the sizes of the pulse and step components of the pulse-step motoneuronal controller signals. This physiological and simulation study shows that glissadic overshoot is caused by pulse width errors and not by pulse height errors. This implies that the CNS can control the firing frequencies and recruitment of motoneurons more precisely than it can control the duration of the high-frequency motoneuronal saccadic burst. (Arch Neurol 35 : 138 - 142, 1978) Gissades are the slow, gliding movements sometimes appended {{to the end of}} normal human saccadie eye movements. Their frequency of occurrence in normal subjects is increased by fatigue. 1 Several recent papers 2 - * have suggested that the existence of <b>glissades</b> could be used to aid in diagnosing internuclear ophthalmoplegia. In these patients, there is a glissadic undershooting of the adducting eye and a concommitant glissadic overshooting of the abducting eye. Sometimes there is abduction nystagmus.

50|$|Once a trail {{has been}} broken up a {{mountain}} or hill, snowshoers often {{find a way to}} speed up the return trip that manages to also be fun and rests the leg muscles: <b>glissading</b> the trail, or sliding down on their buttocks. This does not damage the trail, and in fact helps pack the snow better for later users.|$|R
6000|$|A {{few minutes}} afterwards, {{they crossed the}} shelf. Deering led, and Jimmy, going first on the second rope, rather doubted if they would reach the trees. In summer the long {{straight}} crack was obviously the mountain's rubbish shoot and its sides were ground smooth by rolling stones; now it was packed by hard, firm snow. To slip would mean a savage <b>glissade,</b> and then perhaps a plunge---- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The stair, too, wouldn't be {{too high}} to get her down now and again, and a boat could be handy to shove her into without much exertion. For the matter of that," [...] said the Captain, looking out, [...] "we might have a slide made, like a Swiss couloir, you know, and she could <b>glissade</b> comfortably into the boat out o' the winder. Then, there's a beam to hang her ship an' Chinee {{lanterns}} from, an' a place over the fireplace to stick her knick-knacks. What d'ee think, my lad?" ...|$|E
60|$|He moved a few steps, {{then there}} was a stumble and a sudden cry. I saw him for a moment {{slipping}} down the slanted surface of the rock, and when I reached the edge he hung apparently with one foot on a slippery stone, and his left hand clawing wildly at the snow, which yielded under it. I think his other fingers were in a crevice. The fall might not be dangerous in itself, but it seemed impossible that anybody launched upon that declivity could escape a <b>glissade</b> over the precipice. This struck me in an instant and, grasping a shrub which grew in a crevice, I held out my right hand toward him.|$|E
60|$|There was, indeed, {{ground for}} caution. We {{have said that}} they had climbed to an {{elevated}} plateau on one of the small bergs which formed the outside margin of the rugged ice. The side of this berg was a steep slope of hard snow, so steep that they thought it unwise to attempt the descent by what in Switzerland is termed <b>glissading.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 30 August 1986: Swiss Erhard Loretan and Jean Troillet, {{unprecedented}} and unrepeated, {{climbed the}} north face in a single alpine style push without oxygen, ropes, or tents in 37 hours, and <b>glissaded</b> down in under 5 hours. They climbed mostly at night and carried no backpacks above 8000 m, a style that became known as [...] "night naked". The only ascent outside of the month of May.|$|R
5000|$|In 1961, {{experienced}} climber Colin Chisholm and {{his teenage}} son Doug Chisholm climbed the north side, ascending Elliott Glacier. On the descent, <b>glissading</b> down, they lost control. Ultimately, the two fell 2000 feet of vertical elevation through the crevasses of Elliot Glacier. Colin broke ribs and Doug was unharmed. They {{are believed to}} be the only climbers to survive that particular fall route, now known as the [...] "Chisholm Trail".|$|R
60|$|Jimmy braced his legs, {{pushed off}} and let himself go. In Switzerland {{he had studied}} the <b>glissade,</b> but when one carries a heavy load to balance on a precipitous slope is difficult. It looked as if Deering could not balance, because {{after a few moments}} Jimmy shot past an object that rolled in the snow. Then he himself lost control, his pack pulled him over, and he went head-foremost down hill. When he stopped the pitch was easier, and looking back he saw a belt of cloud three or four hundred feet above. He had gone through the cloud and when he turned his head he saw dark forest roll up from the valley in front. For all that, the highest trees were some {{distance}} off.|$|E
60|$|They went on. The pace, {{instead of}} a scramble, became in places a wild <b>glissade,</b> and no beast of burden but a {{mountain}} pack-horse could have kept its footing ten minutes. Dark pines rose up from beneath them and faded back of them, {{here and there a}} scarred rock or whitened boulder flitted by, and then Millicent's sight was dimmed by a whirling haze of snow. How long the descent lasted she did not know. She could see nothing through the maze of eddying flakes but that a figure, magnified by them to gigantic proportions, rode close beside her, until they left the cloud behind and wound along the face of a declivity, which dipped into empty blackness close beneath.|$|E
6000|$|As it was, {{the monster}} went over headlong, {{with a sort}} of {{compound}} shriek and howl that made the very ice-cliffs ring. Then, down he went--not head or feet first, or sideways, or any way, but every way by turns, and no way long. Indeed, he spun and, as it were, spurted down that mighty face of ice. Each instant intensified the velocity; each whirl increased the complex nature of the force. The ledge half-way down, from which the affrighted gulls fled shrieking, did not even check the descent, but with bursting violence shunted the victim out into space, through which he hurled till re-met by the terrific slope farther down, which let him <b>glissade</b> like a shooting star into indescribable ruin! ...|$|E
60|$|Few of the riven masses {{by which}} they were {{surrounded}} were much above five or six feet thick; but as the children were short of stature, the place seemed to the poor creatures an illimitable world of icy confusion, and many were the slips, <b>glissades,</b> and semi-falls which they experienced before reaching the other side. Reach it they did, however, in a very panting and dishevelled condition, and it said much for Red Rooney's tailoring capacity that the black dress coat was not riven to pieces in the process.|$|R
6000|$|Leaving Selele, we ascended a {{steep hill}} with many <b>glissadès,</b> the effect of last night's rain. These hammock-journeys are mostly {{equivalent}} to walking and paying for carriage; it would be cruelty to animals were one to ride except when entering the villages. After threading {{for half an hour}} lanes of grass, we were received in a little village of the Banza Vivi district by Nessala, linguistère to King Luvungungwete. The guest room was furnished with every luxury; hides of a fine antelope described as the Kudu; cruets, basins, bottles, and other vases; [...] "lustre mugs," [...] John Andersons and Toby Philpots. A good calabash, full of ...|$|R
60|$|Brooke {{said nothing}} further, but {{went out into}} the rain, calling to one of the teamsters, and the mules were got under way. The trail that led to the Elktail mine sloped steep as a roof just there, and was {{slippery}} with rain and mire, but the mules went down it as no other loaded beasts could have done, feeling their way foot by foot, or <b>glissading</b> on all four hoofs for yards together. The men made little attempt to guide them, for a mule is opinionated by nature, and when it cannot find its own way up or down any ascent it is seldom worth while for its driver to endeavor to show it one.|$|R
60|$|Faint as he {{was with}} the blow, Alton did not, however, strive to shake him off now, but grappled with him the more closely, and next moment they had rolled {{crashing}} through a juniper. Then the other man came down undermost and struck a stone, there was a swift <b>glissade</b> over rattling shingle and through smashing undergrowth, and Alton lay still alone, while something rolled on down the slope beneath him, until hearing a splash below he rose with a little hoarse cry and swung himself off the ledge which had arrested him. He rolled over several times, but came down, as he discovered later, whole in limb, for he could think of nothing then as he groped in and out amidst the pools and boulders for his enemy. When he found him the man lay with his face apparently in the water, and only moaned a little when Alton shook him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because, I suppose, {{the other}} thing is better. What other reason could there be? It's more complex, but it's better. THIS, this <b>glissade,</b> would be damned scoundrelism. You know that, and I know that, though we might be put to it to find a reason why. It would be swindling. Drawing the pay of life and then not living. And besides--We're going to live, Ann Veronica! Oh, the things we'll do, the life we'll lead! There'll be trouble in it at times--you and I aren't going to run without friction. But we've got the brains to get over that, and tongues in our heads to talk to each other. We sha'n't hang up on any misunderstanding. Not us. And we're going to fight that old world down there. That old world that had shoved up that silly old hotel, {{and all the rest of}} it.... If we don't live it will think we are afraid of it.... Die, indeed! We're going to do work; we're going to unfold about each other; we're going to have children." ...|$|E
6000|$|Such was {{our first}} {{prospect}} of Juan Silverado. I own I had looked for something different: a clique of neighbourly houses on a village green, we shall say, all empty to be sure, but swept and varnished; a trout stream brawling by; great elms or chestnuts, humming with bees and nested in by song-birds; and the mountains standing round about, as at Jerusalem. Here, mountain and house and the old tools of industry were all alike, rusty and down-falling. The hill was here wedged up, and there poured forth its bowels in a spout of broken mineral; man with his picks and powder, and nature with her own great blasting tools of sun and rain, labouring together at the ruin of that proud mountain. The view up the cañon was a glimpse of devastation; dry red minerals sliding together, {{here and there a}} crag, here and there dwarf thicket clinging in the general <b>glissade,</b> and over all a broken outline trenching on the blue of heaven. Downwards indeed, from our rock eyrie, we beheld the greener side of nature; and the bearing of the pine and the sweet smell of bays and nutmegs commended themselves gratefully to our senses. One way and another, now the die was cast. Silverado be it! ...|$|E
50|$|On 29 January 1865, the Rector of Woolstaston, the Rev. Edmund Donald Carr, {{was walking}} from Ratlinghope {{to a second}} Sunday evening service at another church when he {{was caught in a}} blizzard, lost for 22 hours, snow-blinded and almost died. He emerged in the Cardingmill Valley and must have crossed Wild Moor and Hiddon Hill, some of the wildest country, in his {{struggle}} to survive. His account of the ordeal, A Night in the Snow, has become well known in Shropshire. It causes amusement in summer, with its tale of the reverend gentleman sheltering beneath a dead and frozen horse and plummeting down near-vertical snow <b>glissades</b> clutching his bible, but is a reminder of the dangers of this area in winter.|$|R
60|$|Foster, {{who knew}} he would find waiting tedious, {{went back to the}} car for his small bag, after which he and Pete set off for the hotel. They had some trouble to cross the path of the {{avalanche}} and then spent some time getting past the men who were unloading a row of flat cars. The single-line track was cut out of the rock and one ran a risk of <b>glissading</b> down to the river by venturing outside its edge. Once, indeed, a heavy beam, thrown too far, plunged down like a toboggan, and leaping from a rock's crest splashed into the flood. The men on the cars worked in furious haste, and it was difficult to avoid the clanging rails they threw off.|$|R
25|$|German {{field fortifications}} {{continued}} to be defended by machine-gun fire, artillery-fire and swift local counter-attacks, extra heavy artillery brought from Verdun, was used to extend bombardments beyond the Allied front line, to artillery positions and supply routes. New German defensive works were harder to spot, during the fewer periods of good flying weather, often not being revealed until attacking infantry were engaged from them. The Germans also gained an advantage, from being forced back, as the area most devastated by artillery-fire grew wider {{and was on the}} Allied side, which created chronic problems in transporting supplies to the front line, periodically made worse by downpours, which turned roads and tracks into <b>glissades</b> of mud. It was far easier for supplies to be brought up to the German front line, as it was pushed back along supply lines that had been established for two years.|$|R
60|$|On gaining each {{successive}} ledge of the terraced hill-side, they walked along {{it in the}} hope of reaching better ground, or another snow-slope; but each ledge ended in a precipice, so that there was no resource left but to scramble down to the ledge below to find a similar disappointment. The slopes also increased, rather than decreased, in steepness, yet so gradually, that the mountaineers at last went dropping from point to point down the sheer cliffs without fully realising the danger of their position. At a certain point they came to the head of a slope so steep, that the snow had been unable to lie on it, and it was impossible to <b>glissade</b> on the pure ice. It was quite possible, however, to cut foot-holes down. Le Croix had with him a stout Manilla rope of about three hundred feet in length. With this tied round his waist, and Lewis, firmly planted, holding on to it, he commenced the staircase. Two blows sufficed for each step, yet two hours were consumed before the work was finished. Re-ascending, he tied the rope round Lewis, and thus enabled him to descend with a degree of confidence which he could not have felt if unattached. Le Croix himself descended without this moral support, but, being as sure-footed as a chamois, it mattered little.|$|E
50|$|The {{standing}} <b>glissade</b> {{is often}} the preferred method if the person glissading is skilled in doing so and snow conditions allow. In this glissading position one has {{a better view of}} route hazards, and increased maneuverability over a sitting <b>glissade.</b> In addition a standing <b>glissade</b> cuts down the wet and abrasive forces of the sitting <b>glissade.</b> The standing <b>glissade</b> is best performed over firm snow with a soft top layer.|$|E
50|$|The major {{drawbacks}} to {{the sitting}} <b>glissade</b> are that one's outer layers get wet, {{and that there}} is less control than in a standing <b>glissade.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract-The {{parameter}} {{values for}} this model {{are specific to}} the human eye movement systems; however, {{the form of the}} model is applicable to other neurological motor control systems. The muscle lengthtension diagram was modeled with an ideal spring. The muscle forcevelocity relationship was linearized in a manner that produced a linear model. Initial parameter estimates were based on physiological data, human when possible. Then a function minimization program was used to fine tune model parameters. These parameter values were compared to the original physiological data to ensure that they were within the range of variability of the data. The antagonist dashpot value was selected to minimize the mean squared error between human and model responses; the value produced suggested a unique simplified representation for the original physiological data. The parameter estimation routine was applied to make the model match atypical human eye movements; these simulations suggested that <b>glissades</b> in normals are caused by pulsewidth, not pulse height errors.

60|$|On {{the other}} side the slope was more hospitable. Even trees wintered just below the crest, their great gaunt trunks thrust deep into the snow. We <b>glissaded</b> down the first few hundred feet, till we brought up {{standing}} {{at the head of}} an incipient gorge, likewise smothered in snow. Round the boles of the trees the snow had begun to thaw, which {{gave me a chance to}} measure its depth, by leaning over the rim of the cup and thrusting my pole down as far as I could reach. The point of it must have been over seven feet from the surface, and it touched no bottom. My investigations took time enough to put a bend of the hollow between me and the others, and when at last I looked up they were nowhere to be seen. As I trudged after them alone I felt like that coming historical character, the last man on our then frozen earth.|$|R
40|$|Saccadic eye {{movements}} and their neurological control signals change significantly {{as the human}} fatigues. Electronic instrumentation with a bandwidth extending from DC to 1 kHz enabled the recording of anomalous looking saccadic eye movements that occurred as the subject's physiological state changed. Fatigue can produce: overlapping saccades in which the high-frequency saccadic bursts should show large pauses; <b>glissades</b> in which the high-frequency bursts should be much shorter than appropriate for {{the size of the}} intended saccades; and low-velocity, long-duration, non-Main Sequence saccades in which the motoneuronal bursts should be of lower frequency and longer duration than normal. As few as 30 saccades of 50 deg magnitude or a longer sequence of saccades as small as 10 deg can produce these aberrant eye {{movements and}} their concomitant neuronal firing pattern variations. The effects of fatigue could explain some of the variations between and spread within published data for velocity vs amplitude of human saccadic eye movements. Measuring the resistance to eye movement fatigue could become either a common clinical tool for diagnosing specific or general disease states, or a research tool for studying dyslexia or fatigue...|$|R
