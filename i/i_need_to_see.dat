The candidate stands awkwardly alongside loved ones – {{more often than not}} a wife and two-point-something kids in their Sunday best.

They might be sitting around the kitchen table or out in the garden having a barbecue, enjoying some authentic family time while offering the camera a forced smile.

3000|$|The {{development}} and implementation of the UUSD math curriculum was occurring concurrently with a newly adopted policy for de-tracking students in their math courses and a commitment to universal access, particularly for English learners. Therefore, the district requested that the models be adapted to specifically and explicitly address the needs of English learners. From the TLs’ comments during interviews, it appeared that some teacher complaints about the new curriculum were fueled by a sense that the curriculum was difficult to teach, especially to ELs, because of its emphasis on language-rich text. Joy noted, “because it’s like you have a word problem with every page and they don’t understand these things.” Teachers were also not certain of the relevance of the curriculum to their student population. In her pre-summer interview, Lynn shared, “It’s so different than what it was. … You know, adjustments.

Edward P Mitchell Out of personal preference, I have desisted from annual or even more frequent missives from the Editor, preferring to let the content of the Journal of Clinical Pathology reflect the direction of the editorial team.

40|$|Background: This study {{assessed}} short-term {{changes in}} children’s health and illness attitudes and health status following Facts 4 Life, a school-based health education intervention. Methods: Children aged 7 - 11 years (School Years 3 - 6) recruited from 10 {{schools in the}} UK participated in this study. A quasi-experimental design was utilised with 187 children participating in the intervention, and 108 forming a control condition. Children in both conditions completed measures of health and illness attitudes and health status at baseline and at immediate follow-up. Intervention effects were examined using mixed between-within subjects ANOVA. Results: Analysis revealed significant baseline to follow-up improvements in intervention group responses to “When I feel unwell <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> take medicine to feel better” (Years 3 and 4 : p = 0. 05, η 2 p = 0. 02; Years 5 and 6 : p = 0. 004, η 2 p = 0. 07). For intervention group children in Years 5 and 6 there was an improvement in response to “When I am ill, <b>I</b> always <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a doctor” (p = 0. 01, η 2 p = 0. 07).
