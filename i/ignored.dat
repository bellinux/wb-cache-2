5|$|Adding {{complexity}} to the model, such as rider movement, suspension movement, tire compliance, or frame flex, adds {{degrees of}} freedom. While the rear frame does pitch with leaning and steering, the pitch angle is completely {{constrained by the}} requirement for both wheels {{to remain on the}} ground, and so can be calculated geometrically from the other seven variables. If the location of the bike and the rotation of the wheels are <b>ignored,</b> the first five degrees of freedom can also be <b>ignored,</b> and the bike can be described by just two variables: lean angle and steer angle.|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} this poster is planned <b>ignoring.</b> The {{purpose of this}} poster was to answer the {{question}} of how planned <b>ignoring</b> can be used effectively. Planned <b>ignoring</b> is defined as purposely <b>ignoring</b> an individual who is demonstrating an undesirable behavior. When using planned <b>ignoring,</b> the subject should not be told that planned <b>ignoring</b> is being used. Results of eliminated behavior will not always be revealed immediately. The target behavior may potentially escalate before effective results are demonstrated. It is recommended that planned <b>ignoring</b> not be used with all behaviors such as, if an individual is causing harm to himself or others, the problem should be addressed with a different strategy. According to the research, planned <b>ignoring</b> appears to be effective when employed in classroom settings...|$|R

40|$|In this article, {{the effect}} of <b>ignoring</b> one or more levels of {{variation}} in hierarchical linear regression analysis is explored. A model with four hierarchical levels {{is used as a}} reference model. A distinction is made between <b>ignoring</b> top and intermediate levels. The effects of <b>ignoring</b> levels on the fixed and on the random parameters of different random intercept models are explored by means of a real data set. The results show that <b>ignoring</b> an important level causes an effect on specific fixed coefficients, variance components and their corresponding standard error. Therefore, <b>ignoring</b> an important level can lead to different research conclusions. status: publishe...|$|R
