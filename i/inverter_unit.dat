However, when the two <b>inverter</b> <b>units</b> in parallel structure have differences in amplitude, frequency and phase of the outputting voltage, there will induce large circulating current among the two inverters. A huge harmonic circulating current will be induced especially in the condition of the difference of dead times existed in the two inverters, which not only affects the amplitude and phase of the outputting voltage, but also causes single harmonic. The harmonic circulating current has bad influences on the electrical system, consuming large amounts of energy, causing waveform distortion of the output voltage and inducing electromagnetic interference (Hyosung and Ji 2004). Therefore, it is necessary and significant to research the inhibition technology of the harmonic circulating current in inverter parallel driving systems of mine hoist.|$|R
