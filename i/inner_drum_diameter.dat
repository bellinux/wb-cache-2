These include method of winding the hose around the drum in multi-layers, inlet and outlet position, hose <b>inner</b> <b>diameter,</b> <b>drum</b> <b>diameter.</b> For this purpose, a coil pump was designed, constructed and tested. The experimental results showed that the three layers coil pump has better performance than single and two layer pumps. In addition, improved pump performance is obtained when the pump inlet placed at the top end in the case of multi-layer pumps. Moreover, increase the coil hose <b>inner</b> <b>diameter</b> and/or <b>drum</b> outer <b>diameter</b> results in better coil pump performance...|$|R

40|$|A flow {{straightener}} has {{been incorporated into}} a rotary liquid separator that originally comprised an inlet tube, a shroud plate, an impeller, an <b>inner</b> <b>drum,</b> an outer drum, a housing, a pitot tube, and a hollow shaft motor. As {{a consequence of the}} original geometry of the impeller, shroud, <b>inner</b> <b>drum,</b> and hollow shaft, swirl was created in the airflow inside the hollow shaft during operation. The swirl speed was large enough to cause a significant pressure drop. The {{flow straightener}} consists of vanes on {{the back side of the}} shroud plate. These vanes compartmentalize the inside of the <b>inner</b> <b>drum</b> in such a way as to break up the flow path and thereby stop the air from swirling; as a result, the air enters the hollow shaft with a predominantly axial velocity instead of a swirl. Tests of the rotary liquid separator at an airflow rate of 10 cu ft/min (0. 0047 cu m/s) revealed that the dynamic pressure drop was 8 in. of water (approx. = 2 kPa) in the absence of the flow straightener and was reduced to 1 in. of water (approx. = 0. 25 kPa) in the presence of the flow straightener...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Oil spill {{recovery}} {{by means}} of a rotating drum skimmer was investigated experimentally {{for a wide range of}} design and operating conditions. The effect of <b>drum</b> <b>diameter,</b> <b>drum</b> length, rotating speed, oil lm thickness, oil properties, and drum centre height above the oil/water interface surface were analyzed with respect to oil recovery rate of the drum skimmer. Crude, diesel, SAE 10 W and SAE 140 W oils were used during this investigation. It was found that oil recovery rate increases with increasing <b>drum</b> <b>diameter,</b> <b>drum</b> length, drum centre height above the oil/water interface, and oil slick thickness oil viscosity, and increases as oil density and surface tension decreases. The results revealed that the drum skimmer is an effective device for recovering spills of low viscosity oil, such as light crude oil, which is the type of oil involved in most serious spills and pollutions of the sea. Furthermore, an empirical equation is proposed for predicting the oil recovery rate of the device. The equation can be applied to different oils, and gives good agreement with observed data...|$|R

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of carryover, i. e entrainment of liquid along with separated steam is observed {{in all the}} steam separators. Due to the risks, such as turbine blade erosion and radioactivity leakage, associated with it, it is desired to have {{an estimate of the}} carryover value. This is all the more important when the separation is only under the influence of gravity as proposed in some of the new generation natural circulation reactors. Experiments were carried out in an air-water facility at atmospheric conditions to characterize the entrainment in drums with ratio of the <b>drum</b> <b>diameter</b> to riser diameter varying from 1 to 6. Various parameters influencing the liquid entrainment were identified. The vapour superficial velocity and the <b>drum</b> <b>diameter</b> to riser diameter ratio were found to be the most influencing parameters.

50|$|The boiler {{consists}} of two concentric drums with a waterspace between them. Fire-tubes pass through this drum, arranged symmetrically around the diameter. The entire boiler is wrapped in a cylindrical smokebox. The top of the <b>inner</b> <b>drum</b> is not water-jacketed and is only closed by a steel plate. The outer drum is a parallel cylinder but the <b>inner</b> <b>drum</b> is usually stepped in three diameters: wide around the fire grate to provide the most grate area and to promote rapid boiling in its waterjacket, the central section carries the inner ends of the fire-tubes, and the upper section is narrowed to reduce the unjacketed surface area and to provide an open steam space above the waterline. This upper space is deliberately oversized so that when fitted to a road vehicle, any tilting during hill climbing will still leave an adequate depth of water cover above the tubes.|$|R

In the existing models of the direct rice seeder, the dry/wet seeds are drilled continuously at a higher seed rate than the recommended and without desired seed to seed spacing. It is observed that as the seed drum empties the seed rate obtained increases steadily and steeply at the end i. e. the uniformity in seed rate is not maintained through out its operation. Hence investigation was carried out to study the influence of the machine and operational parameters viz., <b>drum</b> shape, <b>diameter</b> of <b>drum,</b> <b>diameter</b> of seed metering hole, number of seed metering holes and forward speed of operation on seed rate of the rice drum seeder in the laboratory condition. The hyperboloid drum shape was optimized with 200 mm <b>drum</b> <b>diameter,</b> 9 number of seed metering holes having 10 mm diameter of seed metering hole and 1. 0 km h- 1 forward speed of operation.

40|$|A coupled biharmonic spline and linear {{interpolation}} {{algorithm was proposed}} to create a three-dimensional smooth deposit model with minimal curvature containing grade and position data. To obtain the optimal technical parameters, such as cutting height and <b>drum</b> <b>diameter,</b> a virtual longwall mining procedure was modelled by simulating the actual fully mechanized longwall mining process. Based on the above work, a bauxite deposit in a longwall mining panel was modelled by scattered grade data from ores sampled on the entry wall. The deposit was then demarcated by industrial indexes and sliced according to the virtual longwall mining procedure. The {{results show that the}} proposed interpolation algorithm can depict the stratiform structure of bauxite deposits and that the uncovered bauxite deposit has high proportions of high-grade and rich ore. The ranges of optimal cutting height and <b>drum</b> <b>diameters</b> are 1. 72 – 2. 84 m and 1. 42 – 1. 72 m, respectively. Finally, an intellectualized longwall mining procedure was designed to guide the mining process with the lowest dilution and loss rates...|$|R

50|$|The {{construction}} of a new market, designed by architect George Drumgoole Coleman, commenced on the same site in 1836 and it was completed in 1838. Coleman produced an octagonal building with ornamental columns at the entrance. The building had twice the area of the older market, and was formed of an outer and <b>inner</b> <b>drum,</b> with the colonnade of the outer drum letting in light but also providing shelter from the sun and rain. This building was built on two octagonal rings of brick piers, which supported a structure 125 feet in <b>diameter,</b> and an <b>inner</b> <b>drum</b> 40 feet in diameter. As with the previous structure, it suffered from its exposure to the monsoons and the sea, and concerns over its safety were voiced soon after its constructions and over the years. In 1841, the market was extended {{on one side of the}} main building under the supervision of contractor Denis McSwiney with the erection of a new fish market. This new structure was a long open shed, and it was later further extended to run roughly parallel to two sides of the octagonal market. The extension would help protect the main market by serving as a breakwater to reduce the force of the swells and surf from the east. The Telok Ayer market needed to be repaired soon after construction, nevertheless, it stood for over 40 years until it was demolished when land was reclaimed on Telok Ayer Bay, and the prominence of the market on the waterfront made the building a landmark of early Singapore.|$|R
