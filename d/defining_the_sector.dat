The sectoral approaches described in this paper may {{be a way to}} address some of the shortcomings of this Kyoto mechanism. The paper outlines the criticisms that have been raised against the CDM as well as the conflicting interpretations of a sectoral approach and examines in how far it might resolve the mechanism’s perceived shortcomings. Furthermore, it outlines issues that need to be resolved when implementing a sectoral approach: distributing costs and benefits, <b>defining</b> <b>the</b> <b>sector</b> and its baseline, ensuring additionality and tackling procedural issues. A sectoral approach can enable countries to guide their structural development but it also opens up a gap between public and private investment {{that needs to be addressed}} before conflicts arise. Sectoral CDM activities may be able to lower transaction costs for projects that otherwise cannot compete in the CDM market and might even pave the way to sectoral greenhouse gas limitation targets in developing countries by establishing the necessary infrastructure for data collection.

40|$|Since 1995, sector-wide {{approaches}} (SWAps) {{to health}} development have significantly influenced health aid to developing countries. SWAps offer guidelines for new partnerships with international donors led by government, new relationships between donors and shared financing, {{development and implementation}} of agreed packages of health sector reforms. These structural and funding changes have significant implications for reproductive health. The early experience of SWAps suggests that the extent of donor commitment is constrained for administrative, philosophical and political reasons, with vertical programmes (including those relevant to reproductive health) protecting their 2 ̆ 7 core 2 ̆ 7 business, and reproductive health, as an integrative concept, lacking strong advocates. <b>Defining</b> <b>the</b> <b>sector</b> in terms of government health systems focuses resources on building effective district health systems, but with uncertain outcomes for elements of reproductive health that depend on multi-sectoral strategies, e. g. safe motherhood. The context of the reforms remains a determining factor in their success, but despite savings available through increased efficiencies and coordinated services, the total per capita expenditure on health to ensure minimum clinical and public health services often remains beyond the budget available to least developed nations. Despite this, many of the elements of SWAps [...] government leadership, new donor relationships, better coordination, sectoral reform and service integration [...] offer the potential for more effective and efficient health services, including those for reproductive health...|$|E

40|$|Lay-out Maija HeinoThe aim of {{this study}} is to compare the {{predictions}} of the European forest sector development that were made in the European Forest Sector Outlook Study 1960 2000 2020 (EFSOS) and the real development of different indicators <b>defining</b> <b>the</b> <b>sector</b> s actual state. EFSOS presented several scenarios on the European forest sector. Comparisons were carried out for these scenarios on the following attributes: forests available for wood supply, growing stock, net annual increment, fellings, sawnwood net trade, wood-based panels net trade, paper and paperboard net trade and roundwood price development. In addition, the development of the protected forest area and the forests ownership structure were analysed. Series of data for 2000 2008 were analysed. The starting point for both analyses was 2000, which was the starting point of the EFSOS scenarios. These studies on European forest resources were conducted more than 10 years ago. Substantial structural, organisational and policy changes have since been made not only in the forest sector but also in other sectors related to forestry, such as in agriculture, environment and energy. Changes in countries in Central and Eastern Europe and the former USSR during the transition period and the increased use of forest biomass for energy production are the most important changes. In addition, the global economic crisis in the past few years has severely affected the forest sector in Europe. Most of the data series used in the EFSOS models were collected in the 1990 s. Therefore, those changes had some impact on the accuracy of the predictions, especially since 2006, when the first impact of the global financial crisis appeared. The results of this study allow us to conclude that after the recovery of the economy new models and predictions of forest sector development will be needed...|$|E
