Another aspect is the low price production of the sensor. The sensor was tested in engines and gas heatings. The signal of NOx of the sensor was in agreement with the signal of the CLD.

40|$|The {{problem of}} fouling {{in the heat}} {{exchangers}} of exhaust systems {{has yet to be}} resolved. This results in enormous costs for engine manufacturers due to the required over-sizing during design and due to unscheduled maintenance needs. This article presents an experimental layout developed for measuring fouling in diesel engine <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>systems.</b> This facility was based on a circular cylindrical cross-flow device, with one straight and smooth stainless steel probe positioned transverse to the flow of exhaust gases. The probe can be cooled from the inside with water and fouled on the outside as a result of particle deposition from exhaust gases. The tests were conducted under constant engine operating conditions. Therefore, the asymptotic depth of the fouling layer could be measured at different angular positions {{at the end of each}} test. The critical wall shear stress rate is proposed as the controlling mechanism of the local removal process that leads to different fouling depths around each probe. This is in contrast to the critical velocity concept, which cannot be applied at a local scale due to its formulation. The experimental results, although subject to the usual uncertainties of fouling processes, seem to support this idea...|$|E
40|$|Methods to {{characterize}} acoustic sources in flow ducts have been investigated. In {{the first part}} of this thesis a measurement procedure {{to characterize}} an air terminal device using an acoustic one-port source model based on the two microphone technique has been tested and validated. In order to provide a prediction of flow noise generation at different operating points for the device a scaling law was derived. Successful validation experiments were performed. In the second part a new method based on the multi-load technique was developed and used to characterise the source data of various piston-engines with non-linear behaviour. The source characterisation results were compared to results obtained using the well-known linear two-load technique. It was shown that the new non-linear multi-load technique gave improved results when the source was slightly non-linear. In the third part an improved method to characterize noise sources in high temperature flowducts has been suggested. As a test environment for the standard two microphone technique a helium-air mixture has been used to simulate acoustical conditions similar to hot <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>systems.</b> In order to test the method the passive acoustic properties of automotive diesel engine and an unflanged flow duct termination have been experimentally determined.
