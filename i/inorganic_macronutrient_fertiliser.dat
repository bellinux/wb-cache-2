In order to provide sufficient quantities of nutritious food in the future, it is necessary to improve agricultural productivity by up to 70 %. Nutrient deficiencies are one particular threat to food security that can {{have a negative impact on}} crop yield and quality. Currently the standard agricultural approach to prevention is to supply an excess <b>macronutrient</b> <b>fertiliser,</b> such as nitrate or phosphate, during crop production. However, the efficiency of this approach is poor as deficiencies of specific nutrients, such as Ca, are not prevented in this circumstance, and fertiliser use is associated with a host of adverse environmental impacts.

The chemical composition of the brines (temperature: 23. 4 °C to 22. 1 °C; salinity: 40 – 63) was examined on seven occasions over 25 days with measurements of dissolved oxygen, dissolved <b>inorganic</b> <b>macronutrients</b> (nitrate plus nitrite, ammonium, phosphorus [DIP], and silicic acid), pH, total alkalinity (AT), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON), total dissolved inorganic carbon (CT), and the stable isotopic composition of CT (δ 13 CT). The in situ pH ranged from 8. 41 - 8. 82 on the seawater scale, dissolved oxygen from 212 - 604 µmol kg− 1, nitrate from 0. 1 - 3. 1 µmol kg− 1, ammonium 0. 1 - 2. 4 µmol kg− 1, DIP 0. 4 - 2. 0 µmol kg− 1, silicic acid 4 - 80 µmol kg− 1, AT 2, 690 - 4, 620 µeq kg− 1, DOC 115 - 359 µmol kg− 1, DON 8 - 26 µmol kg− 1, CT 2, 090 - 3, 550 µmol kg− 1, and δ 13 CT + 2. 9 ‰ - + 6. 4 ‰. Compared with the chemical composition of surface oceanic water (salinity of 34), the brines had elevated pH, reduced concentrations of dissolved <b>inorganic</b> <b>macronutrients</b> (including carbon), especially dissolved inorganic nitrogen, and were mostly supersaturated with dissolved oxygen with respect to equilibrium with air, whereas the CT was considerably enriched in 13 C. The chemical composition of the brines was consistent with internal biological productivity, {{but there was a}} lack of a distinctive and uniform relationship among the major dissolved inorganic nutrients typically used for describing biological activity. This was interpreted as the result of varying stoichiometry of biological activity within a very small spatial scale. Modification by abiotic processes was a potential contributing factor, such as degassing acting on the dissolved oxygen concentration. Carbonate mineral formation, acting on AT and CT, was not evident in brines from first-year ice but was apparent in brine from second-year ice...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{dynamics}} of the world’s larger permanently open estuaries have been well documented, but much less {{is known about the}} complex {{dynamics of}} smaller temporarily open/closed estuaries (TOCEs). Seventy per cent of South Africa’s 250 estuaries are classified as TOCEs, and many are less than 50 ha. A conceptual model of the water-quality dynamics of TOCEs has been proposed, primarily considering three hydrodynamic states (closed, semi-closed and open). This paper uses data from the East Kleinemonde Estuary, a small TOCE in the warm-temperate region of South Africa, to verify the model, focusing on physico-chemical parameters (salinity, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen and turbidity) and <b>inorganic</b> <b>macronutrients</b> (dissolved <b>inorganic</b> nitrogen and dissolved inorganic phosphate) for the open and closed states. The results generally fitted the model in terms of the behaviour of the physico-chemical parameters and macronutrients in the water column. This knowledge provides a first approach to predict the water-quality dynamics in small TOCEs, thereby ensuring that the often limited resources are targeted at resolving uncertainties at appropriate temporal and spatial scales. TOCEs are not unique to South Africa and also occur along other coasts (Mediterranean and south-western Australia) where this type of model could also be applied...|$|R
40|$|The species composition, {{abundance}} {{and distribution of}} the ichthyoplankton of the Guadiana estuary and adjacent coastal area were studied in relation to several environmental parameters. Sampling occurred during new moon Spring tides, at the ebb and flood, at nine stations, from March 2002 to February 2003. Temperature, salinity, dissolved <b>inorganic</b> <b>macronutrients,</b> seston and organic matter and chlorophyll a were determined at each station. A total of 22 and 34 fish eggs and larvae taxa were identified, respectively. The highest abundances were registered in the lower and middle part of the estuary, {{probably due to the}} presence of species that use the estuary as a preferential spawning ground, mainly Pomatoschistus spp. and Engraulis encrasicolus sensu lato. Temporal patterns of occurrence of ichthyoplankton allowed each species’ spawning season to be determined. Two taxa dominated the ichthyoplanktonic community during spring and summer (Pomatoschistus spp. and E. encrasicolus), whereas Sardina pilchardus was particularly abundant during autumn and winter. The forcing variables responsible for community structure were chlorophyll a and seston for eggs, while temperature, salinity and nitrite explained the larval component. Comparisons of the results with previous ichthyoplankton studies of the Guadiana estuary conducted before the Alqueva dam was built also indicate that river flow has an important impact on the distribution and abundance of ichthyoplankton in the estuary...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{deglaciation}} in Glacier Bay {{has been observed}} to seasonally influence the biogeochemistry of this marine system. The influence from surrounding glaciers, particularly tidewater glaciers, {{has the potential to}} affect the efficiency and structure of the marine food web within Glacier Bay. To assess the magnitude and the spatial and temporal variability in net community production in a glaciated fjord, we measured dissolved <b>inorganic</b> carbon, <b>inorganic</b> <b>macronutrients,</b> dissolved oxygen, and particulate organic carbon between July 2011 and July 2012 in Glacier Bay, Alaska. High net community production rates were observed across the bay (~ 54 to ~ 81 mmol C m − 2 d − 1) between the summer and fall of 2011. However, between the fall and winter, as well as between the winter and spring of 2012, air–sea fluxes of carbon dioxide and organic matter respiration made net community production rates negative across most of the bay as <b>inorganic</b> carbon and <b>macronutrient</b> concentrations returned to pre-bloom levels. The highest organic carbon production occurred within the west arm between the summer and fall of 2011 with ~ 4. 5 × 10 5 kg C d − 1. Bay-wide, there was carbon production of ~ 9. 2 × 10 5 g C d − 1 between the summer and fall. Respiration and air–sea gas exchange were the dominant drivers of carbon chemistry between the fall and winter of 2012. The substantial spatial and temporal variability in our net community production estimates may reflect glacial influences within the bay, as meltwater is depleted in macronutrients relative to marine waters entering from the Gulf of Alaska in the middle and lower parts of the bay. Further glacial retreat will likely lead to additional modifications in the carbon biogeochemistry of Glacier Bay, with unknown consequences for the local marine food web, which includes many species of marine mammals...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relationships}} between the spring phytoplankton community and environmental factors in the Brazil-Malvinas confluence region. Phytoplankton community composition was determined by the high performance liquid chromatography/CHEMTAX approach, complemented with microscopic examination. Abiotic factors included temperature, salinity, dissolved <b>inorganic</b> <b>macronutrients</b> (ammonium, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate and silicate), water column stability and upper mixed layer depth (UMLD). These environmental variables were reasonably informative to explain the variability of the phytoplankton communities (44 % of variation explained). Cluster and canonical correspondence analyses allowed discrimination of four zones (coastal, Sub-Antarctic, tropical and intermediate zones), also identifiable in the T–S diagrams and in the nutrient spatial distribution patterns. The presence of nutrient-rich Sub-Antarctic waters was a major oceanographic feature, associated with diatoms and dinoflagellates. However, in the Sub-Antarctic zone, biomass was particularly low, probably as a result of grazing pressure, as suggested by chemical and biological indicators. In contrast, in oligotrophic tropical waters, phytoplankton was mainly composed by small nanoflagellates and cyanobacteria. A large intermediate zone was also dominated by nanoflagellates, mainly Phaeocystis antarctica, probably favored by strong water column stability. The coastal zone exhibited fairly similar conditions to those in the intermediate zone, but with deeper UMLD, a favorable condition for diatom growth. These results emphasize the importance of the properties of water masses and also biological processes such as grazing in structuring phytoplankton communities in the region...|$|R

A multifactorial experiment using 20 different nutrient-enriched microcosms exposed to different spectral and CO 2 conditions was designed. Before and after a 24 -h in situ incubation, phytoplankton abundance and composition were analysed. Impacts and interactive effects of high CO 2, UVR and nutrients varied among different functional groups. Increased UVR had negative effects on diatoms and cyanobacteria and positive effects on cryptophytes, whereas increased CO 2 inhibited cyanobacteria but increased cryptophyte growth. A positive synergistic interaction between CO 2 and UVR was observed for diatoms; high CO 2 counteracted the negative effects of UVR under ambient nutrient concentrations. Nutrient enrichments suppressed the negative effects of high CO 2 and UVR on cyanobacteria and diatoms, respectively. Beneficial effects of CO 2 were observed for diatoms and cryptophytes under combined additions of nitrate and ammonium, suggesting that growth may be limited by DIC availability when the primary limitation by nitrogen is alleviated. Beneficial effects of high CO 2 and UVR in diatoms were also induced or intensified by ammonium additions. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|In the Southern Ocean, <b>inorganic</b> <b>macronutrients</b> {{are very}} rarely {{depleted}} by phytoplankton growth. This {{has led to}} speculation on possible additional CO 2 drawdown in this region. However, the {{effects of climate change}} can only be predicted once the role of environmental and biotic factors limiting phytoplankton carbon fixation are understood. It is clear that the Southern Ocean is heterogeneous, and no single factor controls prim ary production overall. Ice cover and vertical mixing influence algal growth rates by m odulating radiance flux. Micronutrients, especially iron, may limit growth in some areas. Primary production is also suppressed by high removal rates of algal biomass. Grazing by zooplankton is the major factor determining magnitude and quality of vertical particle flux. Several of the physical controls on phytoplankton production are sensitive to climate change. Although it is impossible to make numerical predictions of future change on the basis of our present knowledge, qualitative assessments can be put forward on the basis of model predictions of climate change and known factors controlling prim ary production. Changes in water temperature and in windinduced mixing are likely to be slight and have little effect. Model predictions of changes in sea-ice cover vary widely, making prediction of biogeochemical effects impossible. Even if climatic change induces increased nutrient uptake, there are several reasons to suspect that carbon sequestration will be ineffective in comparison with continuing anthropogenic CO 2 emission...|$|R

In such nutrient poor conditions bacterioplankton could become photoheterotrophic. We assessed the photoheterotrophy of the key microbial taxa in the North Atlantic oligotrophic gyre and adjacent regions. The experimental work was performed on board the Royal Research Ship James Cook (cruise no. JC 53, October-November 2010) as part of the Atlantic Meridional Transect programme, and on board the Royal Research Ship Discovery (cruise no. D 369, August-September 2011). At each station, samples were collected from 20 m depth with a sampling rosette of 20 -l Niskin bottles mounted on aconductivity-temperature-depth profiler. Samples were collected in 1 l thermos flasks (washed with 10 % v/v HCl) in the dark and processed immediately. Depth of 20 m was chosen because it represents the mixed layer and it was the shallowest depth unaffected by the ship's movement, including thrusting, that could artificially affect microbial metabolism in nutrient-depleted stratified surfacewaters. Molecular identification of flow-sorted cells CARD-FISH was performed on flow-sorted cells to identify the groups for which uptake rates were measured.

The main goal {{of this study is}} to assess the relationship between dissolved <b>inorganic</b> <b>macronutrient</b> concentrations and ratios, light availability and phytoplankton succession in the upper estuary of the Guadiana River prior to the completion of the dam. From April to October 2001 three locations along the upper estuary were sampled fortnightly. Several physical and chemical parameters were analysed and phytoplankton composition, abundance and biomass were determined through inverted and epifluorescence microscopy. Phytoplankton showed a uni-modal cycle with a biomass maximum during spring. A relationship between phytoplankton succession and nutrient ratios seemed to exist. In early spring, N:P was high, Si was abundant and a diatom bloom occurred. This bloom collapsed and an increase in green algae abundance was observed later in spring, with low Si and high N:P. In the summer, N:P and Si were low, and a cyanobacteria bloom developed. This bloom included the potentially toxic Microcystis. Light was probably limiting throughout the sampling period, particularly to non-motile cells. Enhancement of cyanobacteria blooms can be expected, and as the river water is used by local human populations, continued monitoring of the Guadiana estuary will be necessary to evaluate the effects of the Alqueva dam construction on phytoplankton dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Phytoplankton is the {{dominant}} primary producer in aquatic ecosystems and is considered a gauge of ecological condition and change. Some phytoplankton groups, namely diatoms, dinoflagellates, and coccolithophores, produce morphological or chemical fossils {{that can be used}} for paleoenvironmental reconstruction. This study aims to review the processes that regulate dynamics in living phytoplankton and to highlight how this knowledge is used in paleoecological studies. The distribution patterns of phytoplankton in present-day aquatic ecosystems are shaped by the interplay between processes that regulate cell growth and cell death. Cell growth and cell death are regulated by the internal environment of phytoplankton (e. g., specific environmental tolerances, resource uptake properties, cell size, density and morphology, alternative nutritional strategies such as mixotrophy or N 2 uptake, motility, intracellular storage capacities, grazing resistance properties), and by its external environment. The external environment includes variables dependent on the availability of resources (e. g., light intensity, concentration of CO 2 and dissolved <b>inorganic</b> <b>macronutrients</b> and micronutrients, availability of living prey in case of mixotrophs) and variables independent of resources (e. g., temperature, salinity, turbulence, ultraviolet radiation, bioactive compounds, activity of grazers, viruses, and eukaryotic parasites). The importance of recently described loss processes, such as grazing by phagotrophic protists, viral lyses, and programmed cell death, is discussed in the context of its potential impact upon phytoplankton vertical fluxes.

The leading modes of nutrients (N, P, and Si empirical orthogonal functions 1, EOF 1) represent overall negative anomalies throughout growing seasons, showing a mixed signal of variability in the initial levels and drawdown thereafter (low-frequency dynamics). The second most common seasonal patterns of nitrate and phosphate (N and P EOF 2) capture prolonged drawdown events during December–March, which are correlated to Chl EOF 1. Si EOF 2 captures a drawdown event during November–December, which is correlated to Chl EOF 2. These different drawdown patterns are shaped by different sets of physical and climate forcing mechanisms. N and P drawdown events during December–March {{are influenced by the}} winter and spring Southern Annular Mode (SAM) phase, where nutrient utilization is enhanced in a stabilized upper water column as a consequence of SAM-driven winter sea ice and spring wind dynamics. Si drawdown during November–December is influenced by early sea ice retreat, where ice breakup may induce abrupt water column stratification and a subsequent diatom bloom or release of diatom cells from within the sea ice.

Here, we assessed the photoheterotrophy of the key microbial taxa in the North Atlantic oligotrophic gyre and adjacent regions using 33 P-ATP, 3 H-ATP and 35 S-methionine tracers. Light-stimulated uptake of these substrates was assessed in two dominant bacterioplankton groups discriminated by flow cytometric sorting of tracer-labelled cells and identified using catalysed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridisation. One group of cells, encompassing 48 % of all bacterioplankton, were identified as members of the SAR 11 clade, whereas the other group (24 % of all bacterioplankton) was Prochlorococcus. When exposed to light, SAR 11 cells took 31 % more ATP and 32 % more methionine, whereas the Prochlorococcus cells took 33 % more ATP and 34 % more methionine. Other bacterioplankton did not demonstrate light stimulation. Thus, the SAR 11 and Prochlorococcus groups, with distinctly different light-harvesting mechanisms, used light equally to enhance, by approximately one-third, the uptake of different types of organic molecules.

In leaves with intact leaf tips, however, Kh was significantly greater in the youngest leaves, {{which suggests that the}} leaf tip with the hydathode influences resistance and thus flow. Microscopy confirmed that the hydathodal area, which is an apical opening, undergoes structural changes with leaf age; a matrix of microorganisms develops in the older leaves and probably restricts water flow by clogging the hydathodes.

When both explants were cultured in vitro on the highly effective shoot-induction medium devised in this study, 35 and 37 shoots per explant on the average were produced from the petiol of the excised cotyledon and from the primary leaf node, respectively.

Observations of chlorophyll-a, <b>inorganic</b> <b>macronutrients,</b> and zooplankton (using both 150 -μm and 505 -μm mesh nets) were made within two 900 -NM 2 grids (Klondike and Burger) at high spatial resolution three times each in 2008 and 2009, with a third grid (Statoil) sampled twice in 2010. Sea-ice conditions prior to sampling varied notably during the study: seasonal sea ice retreat was earlier and sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) were warmer in 2009 than in 2008, whereas SSTs for 2010 were intermediate between the 2008 and 2009 values. Eighty taxonomic categories of zooplankton, including 11 meroplanktonic categories, were recorded, with the greatest diversity found within the copepods (25 species), followed by the cnidarians (11 species). All species are typical for the region and most are seeded from the Bering Sea. A seasonal progression of the community structure was apparent over each survey area and was likely influenced by temperature. Cold oceanographic conditions in 2008 likely slowed growth and development of the zooplankton, such that holozooplankton abundance averaged 2389 and 106 individualsm– 3 and biomass averaged 10. 5 and 8. 3 mgDWm– 3 in the 150 - and 505 -μm nets, respectively. An early phytoplankton bloom in 2009 apparently supported a zooplankton community of greater abundance, but moderate biomass, averaging 6842 and 189 individualsm– 3, and 16. 3 and 7. 0 mgDWm– 3 in the 150 - and 505 -μm nets, respectively. Highest zooplankton abundance and biomass values among the three years occurred in 2010 : 7396 and 198 individualsm– 3 and 102. 9 and 33. 5 mgDWm– 3 in the 150 - and 505 -μm nets, respectively. Holozooplankton biomass changes were driven by increases in large-bodied, lipid-rich copepods.

40|$|The {{quality of}} water within an estuary {{is inseparable from}} the {{component}} parts; suspended particulate matter (SPM) and the balance of macro-nutrients. Long-term temporal variations and the horizontal advection of both SPM and macro-nutrient concentrations are well-constrained, but the vertical fluxes associated with micro-scale processes, such as turbulence and flocculation, are poorly constrained. The importance of three micro-scale processes on the interactions between SPM and inorganic macro-nutrients, nitrate (NO– 3), ammonium (NH+ 4) and phosphate (PO 3 – 4), are examined in four field campaigns and five laboratory experiments. Field campaigns were conducted in two turbid estuaries. One field campaign was conducted in the Seine estuary, France, and three campaigns in the Tamar estuary, U. K., in order to consider the effects of seasonal variations (spring, summer and autumn). Physical conditions measured included current velocity, turbidity, turbulence and particle size, were recorded using a suite of oceanographic instrumentation. Five different laboratory studies were conducted using the same mini annular flume, with different background conditions. Inorganic macro-nutrients were measured spectrophotometrically on a continuous flow analyser (for NO – 3 and PO 3 – 4) and fluorimetry (NH + 4). Three hypotheses are presented as potential mechanisms controlling the release and uptake of macro-nutrients from sediments. Mechanism One (M 1) described an exchange process between inorganic macro-nutrients and flocculation/disaggregating particles. It was hypothesised that flocculating particles would decrease water column macro-nutrient concentrations, and vice versa. In this study, flocculation was observed in both field sites, {{but there was no}} significant relationship between flocculation and macro-nutrient concentration. Similarly, the five laboratory studies demonstrated no statistically significant relationships between flocculation and macro-nutrient concentrations. Mechanism Two (M 2) hypothesised that turbulence would enhance the release portion of the exchange processes described in M 1. Furthermore, it was proposed that increased turbulence would break bonds between macro-nutrients and the surface of particle faces. Turbulence was observed to limit the floc size in all experiments (both field and laboratory), but this study determined that it did not promote a significant release mechanism for inorganic macro-nutrients. However, this study observed that turbulence {{played a key role in}} the vertical distribution of PO 3 – 4 and NH + 4. In both the Seine and Tamar estuaries, surface and near-bed concentrations were observed to be statistically significantly different (p = < 0. 05). Finally, Mechanism Three (M 3) hypothesised that increased salinity provides additional salt water cations that would enhance flocculation and M 1. This study measured an increase in floc size with increasing salinity in but did not enhance the proposed M 1. Instead, as with turbulence, differences in water density as a result of the salinity affected the vertical distribution of NO – 3. This research concluded that micro-scale processes have no significant impact on the water-column concentration of <b>inorganic</b> <b>macronutrients.</b> Instead, it was observed that two of the three micro-scale processes, turbulence and salinity, play a key role in the vertical distribution of inorganic macro-nutrients in the Tamar and Seine estuaries.

A combination of SST, macronutrient concentrations, and p CO 2 provided the best statistical descriptors of the biogeographic variability in biomineralizing species composition between stations. Emiliania huxleyi occurred in silicic acid-depleted waters between the Subantarctic Front and the Polar Front, a favorable environment for this species after spring diatom blooms remove silicic acid.

This {{is based on the}} assumption that ZnO NPs provide a more soluble and bioavailable source of Zn in soil compared to micron- or millimetre- sized (bulk) ZnO particles currently used for Zn fertilizers in Zn deficient soils. However, a thorough understanding of the fate and reactions in soils and interactions of nanoparticles with plants of ZnO NPs is required prior to the recommendation for use of these novel materials. Therefore, there is a need to investigate dissolution, diffusion, transformation, partitioning and availability of manufactured ZnO NPs in soil to ensure safer and more sustainable application of ZnO NPs as a new source of Zn fertilisers for plants, and better management of their potential risks. Given inclusion of Zn in macronutrient fertilizers is the common procedure for their field application, ZnO NPs and bulk ZnO were coated onto macronutrient fertilizers (monoammonium phosphate (MAP) and urea) and dissolution kinetics, diffusion and solid phase speciation of Zn from coated fertilizers were evaluated. Coating of ZnO on macronutrient fertilizers significantly affected solubility and dissolution kinetics of the ZnO sources, but nano-sized ZnO did not show any enhanced solubility over bulk ZnO. The low pH value of ZnO-coated MAP granules resulted in greater and faster dissolution of ZnO compared to ZnO-coated urea granules. However, interactions of ZnO particles with phosphate in MAP granules likely resulted in precipitation of Zn-phosphate species. The high pH and ionic strength of the dissolving solution resultant from hydrolysis of urea likely promoted aggregation of any ZnO NPs released from coated urea granules and also hindered dissolution of ZnO. To evaluate changes in Zn speciation with coating of the ZnO sources and after incorporation of the coated-fertilizers into an alkaline calcareous soil, synchrotron-based micro X-ray absorption fine structure (μ-XAFS) method was used. The findings confirmed precipitation of Zn-phosphate species at the surface of MAP fertilizer granules irrespective of the size of ZnO particles used for coating. For coated urea, the Zn remained as ZnO species for both nano-sized and bulk ZnO coatings. Solid phase speciation in the fertilized soil varied with distance from the point of fertilizer application. Significant amounts of Zn(OH) ₂ and ZnCO₃ species were identified in the soil some distance from coated urea and MAP, respectively, indicating dissolution/precipitation processes were active. Moreover, limited and comparable diffusion of Zn from coated fertilizers with nanoparticulate or bulk ZnO into soil was observed using micro x-ray fluorescence mapping (μ-XRF). Transformation of Zn at the surface of MAP granules, mass flow of water towards the hygroscopic fertilizer granules or strong aggregation of ZnO nanoparticles released from urea granules could have been the mechanisms which restricted Zn diffusion. Given that coating of ZnO on macronutrient fertilizers markedly reduced Zn solubility, reactions of ZnO NPs and bulk ZnO in soil were studied when applied as the pure oxides. Availability of Zn for durum wheat (Triticum durum) plants from nanoparticulate and bulk sources of ZnO was evaluated in an acidic and an alkaline soil using an isotopic dilution procedure (L value). Significant dissolution and plant acquisition of Zn from ZnO was observed (ca. 50 – 100 % of added), even with limited pre-incubation of soils with the Zn sources. However, no significant effect of particle size was observed on plant acquisition of Zn from the ZnO. Retention and dissolution of ZnO NPs and dissolved Zn species from ZnO NPs was further investigated in five soils with diverse {{physical and chemical}} properties. Strong retention of ZnO NPs and/or dissolved Zn species from ZnO NPs was found in all soils especially in alkaline and calcareous soils. The adsorption affinity of ZnO NPs was generally greater than that of soluble Zn, which suggested ZnO NPs were retained more strongly than soluble Zn in soils. Soil pH and clay content of soil were the most important soil properties affecting retention, although the number of soils used was too small to draw firm conclusions as soil parameters co-varied. Generally, nanoparticulate forms of ZnO appear to offer little advantage over bulk-sized ZnO as a source of fertilizer Zn to crops. Rapid dissolution of ZnO NPs and partitioning of dissolved Zn species derived from ZnO NPs and/or high retention of ZnO NPs in soils suggested that soil application of manufactured ZnO NPs would not appear to offer any benefits over bulk ZnO, whether applied in pure form or along with <b>macronutrient</b> <b>fertilisers.</b> However, from an ecotoxicological point of view, ZnO NPs would not be persistent in soil systems and hence their mobility in soil would be limited. Therefore the risks associated with application of ZnO NPs in soil would be similar to that of soluble Zn. Thesis (Ph. D.)
