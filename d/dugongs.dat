40|$|A {{study to}} compare the {{physiological}} values (heart beat and respiration rate, body temperature, and electrocardiogram/ECG) between adult <b>dugong</b> (AD) and baby <b>dugong</b> (BD) was carried out. The <b>dugong’s</b> physiological values were examined by patient monitor. The results showed that heart beat rates of baby <b>dugong</b> (87. 11 + 8. 70 per minute) was higher than in adult <b>dugong</b> (45. 73 + 4. 10 per minute), but no significant difference was observed on the respiration rates between baby <b>dugong</b> (12. 89 + 3. 08 per minute) and adult <b>dugong</b> (10. 11 + 3. 44 per minute). The body temperature of baby <b>dugong</b> (29. 26 + 0. 77 oC) was {{lower than that of}} adult <b>dugong</b> (31. 42 + 0. 41) oC. Regular heart beat rhythms was detected on Lead I, II, and III of ECG of both in baby and adult <b>dugong.</b> The ECG values of baby <b>dugong</b> was higher on voltages and shorter in duration (p< 0. 05) as compared than those of adult <b>dugong.</b> The axis values in adult <b>dugong</b> showed a position more on the right by (+ 90 o) –(- 135 o) with mean electricity axis (MEA) of + 157, 5 o compared than axis value in baby <b>dugong</b> which appeared to be more on the left by (- 32. 7 o) –(- 76. 7 o) with mean MEA of - 54. 7 o. The differences in cardiorespiration and body temperature values between adult <b>dugong</b> and baby <b>dugong</b> appeared to be due to differences in ages of the mammal, especially related with the differences on the metabolic rate and anatomical growth...|$|R

5|$|Despite being mostly solitary, {{sirenians}} congregate {{in groups}} while females are in estrus. These groups usually include one female with multiple males. Sirenians are K-selectors, so, despite the longevity, females give birth {{only a few}} times during their life and invest considerable parental care in their young. <b>Dugongs</b> generally gather in groups of less than a dozen individuals for one to two days. Since they congregate in turbid waters, little is known about their reproductive behavior. The males are often seen with scars, and the tusks on <b>dugongs</b> grow in first for males, suggesting they are important in lekking. They have also been known to lunge at each other. The age when a female first gives birth is disputed, ranging anywhere from six to seventeen years. The time between births is unclear, with estimates ranging from 2 to 7 years. Manatees can reach sexual maturity as early as two to five years of age. Manatee gestation length is around one year, and then they lactate for one to two years. West Indian manatees and African manatees can breed year-round, and a female will mate with multiple male partners. Amazonian manatees have a breeding season, usually mating when the river levels begin to rise, which varies from place to place.|$|E
5|$|Sirenia is {{an order}} of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit rivers, estuaries, coastal marine waters, swamps and marine wetlands. Sirenians, {{including}} manatees and <b>dugongs,</b> possess major aquatic adaptations: arms used for steering, a paddle used for propulsion, and remnants of hind limbs (legs) {{in the form of}} two small bones floating deep in the muscle. They look ponderous and clumsy but are actually fusiform, hydrodynamic and highly muscular, and mariners before the mid-nineteenth century referred to them as mermaids.|$|E
5|$|Only 18 {{species of}} mammals {{are found in}} Bahrain, animals such as gazelles, desert rabbits and {{hedgehogs}} are common in the wild but the Arabian oryx was hunted to extinction on the island. 25 species of amphibians and reptiles were recorded as well as 21 species of butterflies and 307 species of flora. The marine biotopes are diverse and include extensive sea grass beds and mudflats, patchy coral reefs as well as offshore islands. Sea grass beds are important foraging grounds for some threatened species such as <b>dugongs</b> and the green turtle. In 2003, Bahrain banned the capture of sea cows, marine turtles and dolphins within its territorial waters.|$|E

5|$|The meat, oil, bones, {{and skin}} of {{manatees}} are valuable items. In some countries, such as Nigeria and Cameroon, African manatees are sold to zoos, aquariums, and online as pets, sometimes being shipped internationally. Though illegal, lack {{of law enforcement}} in these areas induce poaching. Some residents of West African countries, such as Mali and Chad, depend on the oil of the African manatee to cure ailments such as ear infections, rheumatism, and skin conditions. Hunting is the largest source of mortality in Amazonian manatees, {{and there are no}} management plans except for in Colombia. Amazonian manatees, especially calves, are sometimes illegally sold as pets, but there are several institutions that care for and rescue these orphans, with the possibility of their releasing into the wild.

40|$|February 23 - 25, 2010, Phuket, ThailandSri Lanka is a {{northern}} Indian Ocean island where the <b>dugong</b> (<b>Dugong</b> dugon) was once {{common in the}} Gulf of Mannar off the northwestern coast. While this population has declined due to excessive hunting and accidental bycatch, its recent status was unknown, due to a dearth of studies {{during the past three}} decades. An interview survey was undertaken in areas of previous <b>dugong</b> occurrence to fill this knowledge gap. The survey determined the continued presence of the <b>dugong</b> in these waters despite a drastic decline in numbers. Local fishing communities were knowledgeable about <b>dugong</b> occurrence, life history, threats and population decline. Despite the <b>dugong</b> being legally protected in Sri Lanka, the remaining population continues to be illegally hunted due to inadequate implementation and enforcement of existing legislation. The problem is exacerbated by the existence of a demand driven market for <b>dugong</b> flesh which is considered a delicacy among the human population. Therefore this already depleted <b>dugong</b> population continues to be threatened with local extirpation if immediate conservation measures are not initiated. Given the impoverished socio-economic circumstances of local fishing communities, innovative community-based conservation approaches are needed and recommended in order to ensure the long-term survival of this <b>dugong</b> population...|$|R

5|$|The {{tiger shark}} is an apex {{predator}} {{and has a}} reputation for eating anything. These predators swim close inland to eat at night, and during the day swim out into deeper waters. Young tiger sharks are found to feed largely on small fish, as well as various small jellyfish, cephalopods, and other mollusks. Around the time they attain , or near sexual maturity, their selection expands considerably, and much larger animals become regular prey. Numerous fish, crustaceans, sea birds, sea snakes, marine mammals (e.g. bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops), common dolphins (Delphinus), spotted dolphins (Stenella), <b>dugongs</b> (Dugong dugon), seals and sea lions, and sea turtles (including the three largest species: the leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), the loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and the green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas),) are regularly eaten by adult tiger sharks. In fact, adult sea turtles have been found in up to 20.8% of studied tiger shark stomachs, indicating somewhat of a dietary preference for sea turtles where they are commonly encountered. They also eat other sharks (including adult sandbar sharks (Carcharhinus plumbeus)), as well as rays, and sometimes even other tiger sharks.|$|E

40|$|The Australian <b>dugong</b> (<b>Dugong</b> dugon) and Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris) are {{threatened}} species of aquatic mammals {{in the order}} Sirenia. Sirenian conservation and management actions would benefit from a more complete understanding of genetic diversity and population structure. Generally, species-specific microsatellite markers are employed in conservation genetic studies; however, robust markers can be difficult and costly to isolate. To {{increase the number of}} available markers, <b>dugong</b> and manatee microsatellite primers were evaluated for cross-species amplification. Furthermore, one manatee and four <b>dugong</b> novel primers are reported. After polymerase chain reaction optimization, 23 (92 %) manatee primers successfully amplified <b>dugong</b> DNA, of which 11 (48 %) were polymorphic. Of the 32 <b>dugong</b> primers tested, 27 (84 %) yielded product in the manatee, of which 17 (63 %) were polymorphic. <b>Dugong</b> and manatee primers were compared and the most informative markers were selected to create robust and informative marker-panels for each species. These cross-species microsatellite marker-panels can be employed to assess other sirenian populations and can provide beneficial information for the protection and management of these unique mammals...|$|R
40|$|The <b>dugong</b> (<b>Dugong</b> dugon) is {{the only}} herbivorous mammal that is {{strictly}} marine and {{is the only}} extant species in the Family Dugongidac. The other members of the order Sirenia, the three species of manatee, all use fresh water to varying degrees (Reynolds and Odell 1991). The only other recent Sirenian, Steller's sea cow, Hydrodamalis gigas, was hunted to extinction within 27 years of its discovery in the eighteenth century (Stejneger 1887). All extant members of Order Sirenia (induding the <b>dugong)</b> are listed as vulnerable to extinction (Hilton-Taylor 2000). All populations of the <b>dugong</b> are also listed on Appendix 1 of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).

Therefore, little biological information is available on local <b>dugong,</b> and new specimens or techniques are necessary to help shed light on the populations of this region. We assessed the suitability of using ancient <b>dugong</b> bones collected from ruins on Shimoji Island, in the Yaeyama Islands, for biological investigations. We collected more than 1, 000 fragments of animal bone at the site. From these, we were able to reconstruct 91 <b>dugong</b> skulls, from which we estimated body length (124. 2 – 301. 2 cm) and age group compositions (43 % adults, 29 % adolescents, and 16 % juveniles). Our estimation revealed a wide range of age groups, from neonates to mature adults. These results suggest that the ancient <b>dugong</b> population bred and spent all life stages along the coasts of the Yaeyama Islands. Moreover, our study shows that these ancient bones can be used for meaningful biological investigations on <b>dugong,</b> and should help to elucidate their historical distribution and population structure in this area...|$|R
