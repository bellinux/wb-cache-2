5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2010, the {{development}} team spent five days and four nights {{in a place called}} the Capcom Manor to work on the game; this was inspired by the filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, who would gather scriptwriters in a hotel room to create the scripts for his films. During their stay in the manor, they discussed the game's plot and the new gameplay system, finalized the direction, and created rough sketches for most characters in the game. For the new character Hakari Mikagami, Iwamoto used a female saint as the main image for her design, and <b>imagined</b> <b>her</b> as being an older woman he could look up to. Another new character, Yumihiko Ichiyanagi, was Eshiro's favorite minor character in the series because of his character arc and how he grows throughout the game. The game was developed for the Ace Attorney series' tenth anniversary; because of this, several characters from previous games in the series made cameo appearances, including Frank Sahwit and Will Powers.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{inspiration}} for Ellie as a gameplay feature, Druckmann recalled when he and game director Bruce Straley brainstormed ideas for [...] (2009). One of their ideas was a sequence with a mute female character whose role was to summon Nathan Drake, Uncharteds main character, and briefly accompany him throughout the sequence; Druckmann felt this created a [...] "beautiful" [...] relationship through gameplay alone. Though this concept was scrapped for Uncharted 2, the idea was raised again when discussing a new project, ultimately inspiring the character of Ellie. The addition of Ellie as an artificial intelligence (AI) required significant overhauling of the game engine. The team intentionally added a feature where Ellie remains close to Joel, to avoid being viewed by players as a [...] "burden". Programmer Max Dyckhoff stated that, when working on Ellie as an AI, he <b>imagined</b> <b>her</b> experiences throughout the game's events {{in an attempt to}} achieve realism. Druckmann also felt inspired by wars that took place in Syria and Afghanistan when creating Ellie; he felt that conflict was familiar to the children in those countries, which is similar to Ellie's view. During the Winter segment of the game, players assume control of Ellie. The developers ensured that this change, as well as the knowledge of Ellie's immunity, was kept secret prior to the game's release to surprise players.|$|E
500|$|Naz {{believes}} that her new friends can {{take her away}} from her home life. She {{falls in love with}} Sol, which Hussen said leads to Naz having to make a difficult decision as Sol is [...] "the wrong person". Naz turns out to be not as strong as first expected, and she puts up a wall. Hussen said that there is something about Sol that attracts her, and as she is stronger than he is, she sees it as taking him in and teaching him. Sol falls for Naz very quickly, and Cole said they have never met people like each other before. Naz is a party girl who loves to have fun, but causes trouble and drama, such as when her argument with Fatboy in episode 1 leads to a fight between the [...] and 2. Hussen said that this was her favourite scene to film. Not everyone gets on with Naz straight away. She is confident and fiery, she has a strong power and people listen to what she has to say. Emer Kenny, who played ZsaZsa Carter in series 1 of EastEnders: E20 {{and was one of the}} writers, introducing the characters in the first episode, said that although Naz was her favourite character to write for, she found it a challenge as she is funny but not a [...] "clown" [...] like Fatboy. Kenny compared Naz to ZsaZsa, saying she is clever but cool, feisty, sassy and able to outwit Fatboy. Kenny also admired the character's costume and makeup, saying she looked perfect and was exactly as she <b>imagined</b> <b>her</b> to look.|$|E

2500|$|Catherine also {{received}} Elisabeth Vigée Le Brun (formerly court painter to Marie Antoinette) at her Tsarskoye Selo residence in St Petersburg, by {{whom she was}} painted shortly before her death. Madame Vigée Le Brun vividly describes the empress in her memoirs: [...] "the sight of this famous woman so impressed me that I {{found it impossible to}} think of anything: I could only stare at her. Firstly I was very surprised at her small stature; I had <b>imagined</b> <b>her</b> to be very tall, as great as her fame. She was also very fat, but her face was still beautiful, and she wore her white hair up, framing it perfectly. Her genius seemed to rest on her forehead, which was both high and wide. Her eyes were soft and sensitive, her nose quite Greek, her colour high and her features expressive. She addressed me immediately in a voice full of sweetness, if a little throaty: [...] "I am delighted to welcome you here, Madame, your reputation runs before you. I am very fond of the arts, especially painting. I am no connoisseur, but I am a great art lover." ...|$|E
2500|$|Enya {{has yet to}} {{undertake}} a concert tour, despite hinting about the idea since the late 1980s and numerous requests from around the world. She claimed that Warner Music and herself [...] "did not see eye to eye" [...] initially as the label <b>imagined</b> <b>her</b> performing on stage [...] "with a piano ... {{maybe two or three}} synthesiser players and that's it". Enya also explained that the time put into her studio albums cause her to [...] "run overtime", leaving little time to plan for other such projects. She also expressed the difficulty in recreating her studio-oriented sound for the stage. In 1996, Nicky Ryan said Enya received an offer worth almost £500,000 to perform a single concert in Japan. In 2016, Enya spoke about the prospect of a live concert when she revealed talks with the Ryans during her three-year break after And Winter Came... (2008) to perform a single show at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City that would be simulcast to cinemas worldwide. Before such an event could happen, Nicky suggested that she enters a studio and record [...] "all the hits" [...] live with an orchestra and choir to see how they would sound.|$|E
2500|$|In the show's second series, Ullman portrays current Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon as {{megalomaniac}} who {{is after}} more than just Scottish Independence. Westminster's youngest MP, Mhairi Black assists Sturgeon in the series opener by torturing a captive JK Rowling. On Sturgeon, Ullman says: [...] "I like her a lot and respect her steeliness. [...] I would love her to meet [...] and play golf with him and whup his ass. [...] Jeremy Dyson <b>imagined</b> <b>her</b> as a Bond villain — we filmed for two days in Chislehurst Caves, it was freezing and I was wearing pink, four-inch high heels. But I felt very powerful, and the crew were very much under my command. I think she will like it — {{she seems to have}} a good sense of humour." [...] The portrayal was lauded by viewers and critics alike as well as angering some SNP supporters. Singer Toyah Willcox implored Sturgeon to take the sketch in the right spirit. Ullman had impersonated Willcox back in the early 1980s. Sturgeon took to Twitter to comment on the impersonation: [...] "Great to see my fav Scottish designers @TottyRocksLtd featuring on @TraceyUllmanTV last night)" [...] Upon seeing her portrayal, Mhairi Black (impersonated by actress Olivia Morgan) was quoted as saying [...] "It was all right. It was quite a bizarre scenario. But I thought it was quite clever and quite witty." [...] In an interview for the Metro newspaper during the 2017 United Kingdom general election, Nicola Sturgeon was asked about Ullman's impersonation of her. [...] "I've not seen all of them but I had to watch some because I've heard so much about it. I thought it was really funny." [...] When asked if she should her in all the [...] "Brexit drama", Sturgeon responded: [...] "I definitely think she should! She's got the outfit and everything!" ...|$|E

40|$|Not all imaginings are successful; {{sometimes}} when an imaginer {{sets out to}} <b>imagine</b> some target, <b>her</b> <b>imagining</b> involves some kind of mistake. The error can be diagnosed in two ways: (1) the imaginer <b>imagines</b> <b>her</b> target {{in a way that}} mischaracterizes it, or (2) the imaginer fails to <b>imagine</b> <b>her</b> target at all and rather imagines something else that is similar in some ways to that target. In ordinary day-to-day imaginings, explanations of type (1) seem most natural, but in discussions of philosophical imaginings, philosophers tend to adopt explanations of type (2). This paper argues against this tendency...|$|R

6000|$|He {{found her}} strange, not {{as he had}} <b>imagined</b> <b>her.</b> Not powerful, as he had <b>imagined</b> <b>her.</b> Strange, in his arms she seemed almost small and childish, whilst in daily life she looked a full, womanly woman. Strange, the naked way she clung to him! Almost like a sister, a younger sister! Or like a child! It filled him with a curious wonder, almost a bewilderment. In the dark sightlessness of passion, she seemed almost like a {{clinging}} child in his arms. And yet like a child who in some deep and essential way mocked him. In some strange and incomprehensible way, as a girl-child blindly obstinate in her deepest nature, she was against him. He felt she was not his woman. Through him went the feeling, [...] "This is not my woman." ...|$|E
