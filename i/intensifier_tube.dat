25|$|By 2001, the United States federal {{government}} {{concluded that a}} tube’s “Generation” was not a determinant factor of a tube’s global performance, making the term “Generation” irrelevant in determining the performance of an Image <b>Intensifier</b> <b>Tube,</b> and therefore eliminated the term as a basis of export regulations.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{image intensifiers}} no longer use a {{separate}} fluorescent screen. Instead, a caesium iodide phosphor is deposited {{directly on the}} photocathode of the <b>intensifier</b> <b>tube.</b> On a typical general purpose system, the output image is approximately 105 times brighter than the input image. This brightness gain comprises a flux gain (amplification of photon number) and minification gain (concentration of photons from a large input screen onto a small output screen) each of approximately 100. This level of gain is sufficient that quantum noise, due to {{the limited number of}} X-ray photons, is a significant factor limiting image quality.|$|E
25|$|An image {{intensifier}} or image <b>intensifier</b> <b>tube</b> is a vacuum tube device {{for increasing the}} intensity of available light in an optical system to allow use under low-light conditions, such as at night, to facilitate visual imaging of low-light processes, such as fluorescence of materials in X-rays or gamma rays (X-ray {{image intensifier}}), or for conversion of non-visible light sources, such as near-infrared or short wave infrared to visible. They operate by converting photons of light into electrons, amplifying the electrons (usually with a microchannel plate), and then converting the amplified electrons back into photons for viewing. They are used in devices such as night vision goggles.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} common terms used for Image <b>Intensifier</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{development}} of image <b>intensifier</b> <b>tubes</b> began during the 20th century, with continuous development since inception.|$|R
40|$|Testing {{of image}} <b>intensifier</b> <b>tubes</b> is still done using mostly manual methods {{due to a}} series of both {{technical}} and legal problems with test automation. Computerized stations for semi-automated testing of IITs are considered as novelty and are under continuous improvements. This paper presents a novel test station that enables semi-automated measurement of image <b>intensifier</b> <b>tubes.</b> Wide test capabilities and advanced design solutions rise the developed test station significantly above the current level of night vision metrology...|$|R
25|$|A {{night vision}} device (NVD), {{also known as}} night optical/observation device (NOD) and night vision goggles (NVG), is an {{optoelectronic}} device that allows images to be produced in levels of light approaching total darkness. The image may be a conversion to visible light of both visible light and near-infrared, while by convention detection of thermal infrared is denoted thermal imaging. The image produced is typically monochrome, e.g. shades of green. NVDs are most often used by the military and law enforcement agencies, but are available to civilian users. The term usually refers to a complete unit, including an image <b>intensifier</b> <b>tube,</b> a protective and generally water-resistant housing, and some type of mounting system. Many NVDs also include optical components such as a sacrificial lens, or telescopic lenses or mirrors. An NVD may have an IR illuminator, making it an active as opposed to passive night vision device.|$|E
25|$|Photons {{hitting a}} thin film of alkali metal or {{semiconductor}} material such as gallium arsenide in an image <b>intensifier</b> <b>tube</b> cause the ejection of photoelectrons due to the photoelectric effect. These are accelerated by an electrostatic field where they strike a phosphor coated screen, converting the electrons back into photons. Intensification of the signal is achieved either through acceleration of the electrons or by {{increasing the number of}} electrons through secondary emissions, such as with a micro-channel plate. Sometimes a combination of both methods is used. Additional kinetic energy is required to move an electron out of the conduction band and into the vacuum level. This is known as the electron affinity of the photocathode and is another barrier to photoemission other than the forbidden band, explained by the band gap model. Some materials such as Gallium Arsenide have an effective electron affinity that is below the level of the conduction band. In these materials, electrons that move to the conduction band are all of sufficient energy to be emitted from the material and as such, the film that absorbs photons can be quite thick. These materials are known as negative electron affinity materials.|$|E
25|$|Fluoroscopy and {{angiography}} {{are special}} applications of X-ray imaging, {{in which a}} fluorescent screen and image <b>intensifier</b> <b>tube</b> is connected to a closed-circuit television system. This allows real-time imaging of structures in motion or augmented with a radiocontrast agent. Radiocontrast agents are usually administered by swallowing or injecting {{into the body of}} the patient to delineate anatomy and functioning of the blood vessels, the genitourinary system, or the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract). Two radiocontrast agents are presently in common use. Barium sulfate (BaSO4) is given orally or rectally for evaluation of the GI tract. Iodine, in multiple proprietary forms, is given by oral, rectal, intra-arterial or intravenous routes. These radiocontrast agents strongly absorb or scatter X-rays, and in conjunction with the real-time imaging, allow demonstration of dynamic processes, such as peristalsis in the digestive tract or blood flow in arteries and veins. Iodine contrast may also be concentrated in abnormal areas more or less than in normal tissues and make abnormalities (tumors, cysts, inflammation) more conspicuous. Additionally, in specific circumstances, air {{can be used as a}} contrast agent for the gastrointestinal system and carbon dioxide can be used as a contrast agent in the venous system; in these cases, the contrast agent attenuates the X-ray radiation less than the surrounding tissues.|$|E
50|$|Cold cathodes {{may also}} emit {{electrons}} by photoelectric emission. These are often called photocathodes {{and are used}} in phototubes used in scientific instruments and image <b>intensifier</b> <b>tubes</b> used in night vision goggles.|$|R

50|$|Because of {{the limited}} {{availability}} of 25mm image <b>intensifier</b> <b>tubes</b> and housings to civilians, what AN/PVS-4s did become available tended to have well used tubes and as a result, civilians tended to avoid buying them.|$|R
2500|$|In 2014, European {{image tube}} {{manufacturer}} PHOTONIS released the first global, open, performance specification; [...] "4G". The specification had four main requirements that an image <b>intensifier</b> <b>tube</b> {{would have to}} meet.|$|E
2500|$|Electronic Gating (or 'gating') is a {{means by}} which an image <b>intensifier</b> <b>tube</b> may be {{switched}} ON and OFF in a controlled manner. An electronically gated image <b>intensifier</b> <b>tube</b> functions like a camera shutter, allowing images to pass through when the electronic [...] "gate" [...] is enabled. The gating durations can be very short (nanoseconds or even picoseconds). [...] This makes gated image intensifier tubes ideal candidates for use in research environments where very short duration events must be photographed. As an example, in order to assist engineers in designing more efficient combustion chambers, gated imaging tubes have been used to record very fast events such as the wavefront of burning fuel in an internal combustion engine.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sensitivity}} {{of an image}} <b>intensifier</b> <b>tube</b> is measured in microamperes per lumen (µA/lm). It defines how many electrons are produced per quantity of light that falls on the photocathode. This measurement should be made at a specific color temperature, such as [...] "at a colour temperature of 2854K". The color temperature at which this test is made tends to vary slightly between manufacturers. Additional measurements at specific wavelengths are usually also specified, especially for Gen2 devices, such as at 800nm and 850nm (infrared).|$|E
25|$|Image <b>intensifier</b> <b>tubes</b> (IITs) are {{optoelectronic}} {{devices that}} allow many devices, such as night vision devices and medical imaging devices, to function.

40|$|A novel {{approach}} to significantly increasing {{the field of}} view (FOV) of night vision goggles (NVGs) has been developed and demonstrated. This approach uses four image <b>intensifier</b> <b>tubes</b> instead of the usual two to produce a very wide 100 degree horizontal by about 4 0 degree vertical FOV. A conceptual working model, designated the Panoramic NVG, has been fabricated and evaluated. 40 degrees. The PNVG’s folded optical system resulted in a much better center of gravity compared to the currently fielded AN/AVS- 6 and AN/AVS- 9 type NVG configuration. Even with the added image <b>intensifier</b> <b>tubes</b> and associated optics, the overall weight of the device was comparable to currently fielded NVGs. The larger FOV and better center of gravity should reduce fatigue effects during long missions and potentially permit the PNVG to be retained upon ejection for use in evasion, escape, and rescue...|$|R
