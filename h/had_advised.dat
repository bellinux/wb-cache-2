It was renovated {{to make it}} look {{as it was in the}} 1950s when Lennon lived there, and Ono paid a visit before it was opened to the public. Lennon's cousin, Michael Cadwallader, <b>had</b> <b>advised</b> the National Trust on how the house looked when the Smiths lived there.|$|E
5|$|Despite these {{economic}} indicators, the Budget presented in August 1974 saw large increases in spending, especially in education. Treasury officials <b>had</b> <b>advised</b> {{a series of}} tax and fee increases, ranging from excise taxes {{to the cost of}} posting a letter; their advice was mostly rejected by Cabinet. The Budget was unsuccessful in dealing with the inflation and unemployment, and Whitlam introduced large tax cuts in November. He also announced additional spending to help the private sector.|$|E
5|$|During the Singer World Series {{tournament in}} Sri Lanka in September 1994, which {{involved}} India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Australia, the Australian team {{stayed at the}} Oberoi Hotel in the capital Colombo. There was a casino {{in close proximity to}} the hotel, which Waugh and Warne visited. Team manager Colin Egar <b>had</b> <b>advised</b> Warne that he had been told that the venue was unsavoury, but he was vague in his comments, and at the time, casinos were not perceived as trouble spots or traps for unwary cricketers.|$|E

5|$|During the trial, {{the defense}} {{presents}} evidence that Deng {{was convicted of}} prostitution two years ago. Deng denies the charge and says she had been gang-raped by the soldiers who killed her husband. Deng's credibility weakens further when the defense presents a surprise witness, Daniel Achok, who testifies that he <b>had</b> <b>advised</b> her to fabricate the gang rape on her application for political asylum. The jury reached verdicts {{on two of the}} three charges, finding DiStasio guilty of unlawful imprisonment and not guilty of assault but deadlocks on the rape charge, and Benson says that he will likely serve a year in prison.|$|E
5|$|In vain, the King urged Conservative leaders Arthur Balfour and Lord Lansdowne to {{pass the}} Budget, which Lord Esher <b>had</b> <b>advised</b> him was not unusual, as Queen Victoria had helped to broker {{agreements}} between the two Houses over Irish disestablishment in 1869 and the Third Reform Act in 1884. On Asquith's advice, however, he did not offer them an election (at which, to judge from recent by-elections, they were likely to gain seats) {{as a reward for}} doing so.|$|E
5|$|O'Dell {{set about}} {{contacting}} local musicians from the Harrisons' rented house in Nichols Canyon, as Harrison took the long-distance calls, hoping {{more than anything}} to secure Bob Dylan's participation. Almost all of Harrison's first-choice names signed on immediately, while a day spent boating with Memphis musician Don Nix resulted in the latter agreeing to organise a group of backing singers. A local Indian astrologer <b>had</b> <b>advised</b> early August as a good time in which to stage the concert, and as things transpired, the 1st of that month, a Sunday, was the only day that Madison Square Garden was available at such short notice.|$|E

5|$|In February 1799, Adams {{surprised}} many {{by sending}} diplomat William Vans Murray on a peace mission to France. Napoleon, {{realizing that the}} conflict was pointless, signaled his readiness for friendly relations. At the Convention of 1800, the two sides agreed to return any captured ships and {{to allow for the}} peaceful transfer of non-military goods to an enemy of the nation. The Treaty of Alliance of 1778 was superseded and the United States was then free of foreign entanglements, as Washington <b>had</b> <b>advised</b> in his farewell address. Adams brought in John Marshall as Secretary of State and demobilized the emergency army. Adams proudly avoided war, but deeply split his party in the process.|$|E
5|$|In {{the light}} of {{lessons learned from the}} partial Canadian success during Operation Windsor, Charnwood was to be {{launched}} on a broad front to increase the pressure on the German defences and disperse their defensive fire. SHAEF planners <b>had</b> <b>advised,</b> on 10 June, {{that the best way to}} break a stalemate was to use air power to support an attack; this method was to be used for Charnwood as Montgomery enlisted the aid of RAF Bomber Command. Heavy bombers would attack Caen on the night preceding the assault, with 15% of the total bomb load being delayed action bombs set to explode when the ground attack was launched. A second wave of light bombers would follow the heavies and a third wave of American bombers would attack on the morning of the operation.|$|E
5|$|Churchill did {{not support}} the government, however. In July, he <b>had</b> <b>advised</b> the King's legal counsel, Walter Monckton, against the divorce, but his advice was ignored. As soon as the affair became public knowledge, Churchill started to {{pressure}} Baldwin and the King to delay any decisions until parliament and the people had been consulted. In a private letter to Geoffrey Dawson, the editor of The Times newspaper, Churchill suggested that a delay would be beneficial because, given time, the King might fall out of love with Simpson. Baldwin rejected the request for delay, presumably because he preferred to resolve the crisis quickly. Supporters of the King alleged a conspiracy between Baldwin, Geoffrey Dawson, and Cosmo Gordon Lang, the Archbishop of Canterbury. The royal physician Bertrand Dawson was possibly involved in a plan to force the prime minister to retire on the grounds of heart disease, but he eventually accepted, on the evidence of an early electrocardiograph, that Baldwin's heart was sound.|$|E

5|$|On 30April, President and Congress {{sailed through}} the {{blockade}} on their third cruise of the war. On 2May, they pursued , but she outran them and escaped. President parted company with Congress on 8May, and Rodgers set a course along the Gulf Stream {{to search for}} merchant ships to capture. By June, not having come across a single ship, President turned north; she put into North Bergen, Norway, on 27June to replenish her drinking water. Sailing soon after, President captured two British merchant ships, which helped to replenish her stores. On 10 June President captured the outward-bound Falmouth packet Duke of Montrose, Captain Aaron Groub Blewett, which managed to throw her mails overboard before President could send a prize crew aboard. President made a cartel of Duke of Montrose, putting all of Presidents prisoners on board and then sending her into Falmouth {{under the command of}} an American officer. When Duke of Montrose arrived at Falmouth the British Government abrogated the cartel {{on the grounds that they}} <b>had</b> <b>advised</b> the American Government that the British would not recognize agreements entered into on the high seas.|$|E
5|$|On one {{occasion}} {{while he was}} bathing in the Saigon River, Nao decided to inspect the sewer tunnel which his father <b>had</b> <b>advised</b> him to use. Nao concluded that the tunnel would provide {{the best way to}} get in and out of the American area, but using it also presented challenges. The sewerage tunnel contained both wastes and toxic oils which could cause blindness, so Nao and his men would have to close their eyes as they move through the tunnel, in order to avoid blindness. Furthermore, Nao and his men must wash their bodies to get rid of the deadly odours to avoid detection, and probably arrest, by South Vietnamese authorities. After Nao had surveyed the tunnels which lead into the port, he presented his plan of attack to the Saigon-Gia Dinh Military District Headquarters. Nao decided to utilise high explosives, enough to sink a ship, and detonate it using a timer so that his men could get away safely. Nao’s superiors approved the plan, and they ordered him to launch the attack before sunrise to avoid killing local Vietnamese civilians.|$|E
5|$|O'Sullivan {{withdrew from}} the first ranking event of the season, the Shanghai Masters, citing back {{problems}} for which doctors <b>had</b> <b>advised</b> him not to travel. He also chose not to enter the invitational Pot Black tournament. He made {{the final of the}} Grand Prix, but lost 6–9 against Marco Fu. During the Northern Ireland Trophy, he set a new record by compiling five centuries in a 5–2 win over Ali Carter. This also included his seventh official competitive 147 maximum break. O'Sullivan went out of the tournament in the next round, having lost against Fergal O'Brien. On 2 December 2007, he won a fourth consecutive, and record seventh total, Premier League Snooker title, by beating John Higgins in the final by a score of 7–4. On 15 December 2007, O'Sullivan compiled his eighth maximum break in competition, in the deciding frame of his UK Championship semi–final against Mark Selby at Telford, equalling Hendry's record. In doing so, he also became only the third person in professional competition to compile a maximum to win a match. Hendry had made the first against O'Sullivan in the 1997 Charity Challenge final, and Mark Williams had made the second, at the Crucible {{in the first round of}} the 2005 World Championship. O'Sullivan is also the second player after John Higgins to make breaks of 147 in two consecutive ranking tournaments (2007 Northern Ireland Trophy and 2007 Maplin UK Championship). He then went on to win the tournament, beating Stephen Maguire 10–2 in the final (from 8–0 up), thereby receiving a £100,000 cheque for winning his first ranking tournament in almost three years.|$|E
