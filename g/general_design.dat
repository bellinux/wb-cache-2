5|$|Above {{the window}} is the album title {{and at the top}} of the cover is the band's name in a {{typeface}} more crafty than on previous album covers. Though the <b>general</b> <b>design</b> of the cover is that of a 1930s hotel in style, the typeface juxtaposes the <b>general</b> <b>design</b> with being a rather futuristic, science-fiction styled typeset. This is the second futuristic style that the band has used for their name, the first appearing on Vulture Street.|$|E
5|$|Borobudur differs {{markedly}} {{from the}} <b>general</b> <b>design</b> of other structures built for this purpose. Instead of being {{built on a}} flat surface, Borobudur is built on a natural hill. However, construction technique is similar to other temples in Java. Without the inner spaces seen in other temples, and with a <b>general</b> <b>design</b> similar {{to the shape of}} pyramid, Borobudur was first thought more likely to have served as a stupa, instead of a temple. A stupa is intended as a shrine for the Buddha. Sometimes stupas were built only as devotional symbols of Buddhism. A temple, on the other hand, is used as a house of worship. The meticulous complexity of the monument's design suggests that Borobudur is in fact a temple.|$|E
5|$|Test {{data from}} the earlier Lockheed X-7 {{unmanned}} ramjet/rocket program proved invaluable for aerodynamic research since the XF-104 would share the <b>general</b> <b>design</b> of the X-7's wing and tail. Experience gained from the Douglas X-3 Stiletto was also used in the design phase of the XF-104. Over 400 surplus instrumented artillery rockets were launched to test various airfoils and tail designs; from which the camera film and telemetry were recovered by parachute.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} <b>general</b> <b>designs.</b> The earliest, and by far, least common design today, is the fully rigid rotor system; the blades are rigidly {{fixed to the}} rotor hub but made of a {{flexible}} material that allows some degree of flap.|$|R
5|$|The Medway long barrows all {{conformed}} {{to the same}} <b>general</b> <b>design</b> plan, and are all aligned on an east to west axis. Each had a stone chamber at {{the eastern end of}} the mound, and they each probably had a stone facade flanking the entrance. The chambers were constructed from sarsen, a dense, hard, and durable stone that occurs naturally throughout Kent, having formed out of silicified sand from the Eocene epoch. Early Neolithic builders would have selected blocks from the local area, and then transported them {{to the site of the}} monument to be erected.|$|E
5|$|The {{facade of}} the mosque was built in 1065 CE on the {{instructions}} of the Fatimid caliph al-Mustansir Billah. It was crowned with a balustrade consisting of arcades and small columns. The Crusaders damaged the facade, but it was restored and renovated by the Ayyubids. One addition was the covering of the facade with tiles. The second-hand material of the facade's arches includes sculpted, ornamental material taken from Crusader structures in Jerusalem. The facade consists of fourteen stone arches, {{most of which are}} of a Romanesque style. The outer arches added by the Mamluks follow the same <b>general</b> <b>design.</b> The entrance to the mosque is through the facade's central arch.|$|E
5|$|In 1994 the <b>general</b> <b>design</b> of the {{banknotes}} {{was reviewed}} {{to keep up}} with advancing technologies against counterfeiting, which resulted in the release of two new denominations ($50 and $100) between 1994 and 1995, also to counter the effects of consumer price inflation, which peaked at 41.6% in 1992. Although the Chiremba Balancing Rocks were retained, other features including latent imaging in which the letters RBZ can be seen when the banknote is tilted horizontally at the eye level and identification marks for the visually impaired were added to the design, and the neck of the Zimbabwe Bird watermark was longer. The $5, $10 and $20 banknotes were also revised with the new designs in 1997, whilst the $2 banknote was and replaced by a coin in the same year with the $5 denomination undergoing the same process in August 2001.|$|E
50|$|The <b>General</b> Aviation <b>Design</b> Bureau T-32 Maverick is a Ukrainian {{ultralight}} trike {{under development}} by the <b>General</b> Aviation <b>Design</b> Bureau of Ukraine, based in Kiev.

50|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of the two <b>general</b> <b>designs.</b> Top-loading machines in Asia use impellers instead of agitators. Impellers are similar to agitators except {{that they do not}} have the center post extending up in the middle of the wash tub basket.|$|R
40|$|Transitive signature, {{motivated}} by signing vertices and edges of a dynamically growing, transitively closed graph, was first proposed by Micali and Rivest. The <b>general</b> <b>designing</b> paradigm proposed there involved a underlying standard signature scheme, which {{is required to}} be existentially unforgeable against adaptive chosen message attacks...|$|R
5|$|Like {{the other}} {{characters}} of the series, Perry was structured in a simple style to allow young viewers to easily draw him. In keeping with the show's <b>general</b> <b>design</b> scheme, Perry is constructed of geometric shapes in a style reminiscent of deceased Looney Tunes animator Tex Avery. Povenmire uses different design styles for drawing Perry depending on how he is portrayed. When Perry is portrayed as a domesticated and mindless pet, Povenmire begins with a square shaped like a loaf of bread. He then draws his front legs and feet before drawing his bill, which is set at a certain angle. Povenmire then draws his eyeballs, which are never focused and look in opposing directions in a daze. He concludes the figure by adding his hind legs, tail, hair, and finally color.|$|E
5|$|The bells {{are usually}} made from bronze, using {{a form of}} {{expendable}} mould casting. They are typically augmented and ornamented {{with a variety of}} bosses, raised bands and inscriptions. The earliest of these bells in Japan date to around 600 CE, although the <b>general</b> <b>design</b> is of much earlier Chinese origin and shares some of the features seen in ancient Chinese bells. The bells' penetrating and pervasive tone carries over considerable distances, which led to their use as signals, timekeepers and alarms. In addition, the sound of the bell is thought to have supernatural properties; it is believed, for example, that it can be heard in the underworld. The spiritual significance of bonshō means that they {{play an important role in}} Buddhist ceremonies, particularly the New Year and Bon festivals. Throughout Japanese history these bells have become associated with stories and legends, both fictional, such as the Benkei Bell of Mii-dera, and historical, such as the bell of Hōkō-ji. In modern times, bonshō have become symbols of world peace.|$|E

50|$|Because of its {{isolation}} and the dry, windless, stable {{climate of the}} plateau, the lines have mostly been naturally preserved. Extremely rare changes in weather may temporarily alter the <b>general</b> <b>designs.</b> As of 2012, the lines {{are said to have}} been deteriorating because of an influx of squatters inhabiting the lands.|$|R
50|$|The use {{of urban}} {{planning}} in ancient Egypt {{is a matter}} of continuous debate. Because ancient sites usually survive only in fragments, and many ancient Egyptian cities have been continuously inhabited since their original forms, relatively little is actually understood about the <b>general</b> <b>designs</b> of Egyptian towns for any given period.|$|R
25|$|Occasionally {{the church}} would change the design {{slightly}} adding or removing square footage, but keeping the <b>general</b> <b>design</b> the same, with two ordinance rooms and two sealing rooms. Other temples have distinct modifications to their exteriors and size.|$|E
25|$|The {{interiors}} {{of the buildings}} were left to {{the owners of the}} buildings, but the façades were strictly regulated, to ensure that they were the same height, color, material, and <b>general</b> <b>design,</b> and were harmonious when all seen together.|$|E

25|$|Construction {{began in}} 1646 to designs {{which had been}} created in 1636 by Christophe Gamard, but the Fronde interfered, and only the Lady Chapel had been built by 1660, when Daniel Gittard {{provided}} a new <b>general</b> <b>design</b> {{for most of the}} church. Gittard completed the sanctuary, ambulatory, apsidal chapels, transept, and north portal (1670–1678), after which construction was halted for lack of funds.|$|E
50|$|Simultaneously, {{a school}} of {{international}} experts representing {{a wide spectrum of}} expertise (technical, architectural, and landscape), chaired by Jean-François Coste, was established to clarify the choices that had to be made.

25|$|Some {{phenotypic}} traits can be seen, such as {{eye color}} while others {{can only be}} detected, such as blood type or intelligence. Traits determined by genes can be modified by the animal's surroundings (environment): for example, the <b>general</b> <b>design</b> of a tiger's stripes is inherited, but the specific stripe pattern {{is determined by the}} tiger's surroundings. Another example is a person's height: it is determined by both genetics and nutrition.|$|E
25|$|The 7.62mm Galil {{is derived}} from the 5.56mm base version. The rifle retains the <b>general</b> <b>design</b> layout and method of {{operation}} of the 5.56mm variant. In 7.62mm the Galil is available in several different configurations, including a SAR carbine, full-size AR rifle and ARM light machine gun.
