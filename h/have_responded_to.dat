5|$|Australians {{participated in}} the defence of Britain {{throughout}} the war. More than 100Australian airmen fought with the RAF during the Battle of Britain in 1940, including over 30fighter pilots. Two AIF brigades (the 18th and 25th) were also stationed in Britain from June 1940 to January 1941 and formed part of the British mobile reserve which would <b>have</b> <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> any German landings. An Australian Army forestry group served in Britain between 1940 and 1943. Several Australian fighter squadrons were also formed in Britain during 1941 and 1942 and contributed to defending the country from German air raids and, from mid-1944, V-1 flying bombs.|$|E
5|$|Governments {{such as the}} Netherlands and New Zealand <b>have</b> <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> the public's {{concerns}} by outlawing invasive {{experiments on}} certain classes of non-human primates, particularly the great apes. In 2015, captive chimpanzees in the U.S. {{were added to the}} Endangered Species Act adding new road blocks to those wishing to experiment on them. Similarly, citing ethical considerations and the availability of alternative research methods, the U.S. NIH announced in 2013 that it would dramatically reduce and eventually phase out experiments on chimpanzees.|$|E

5|$|In 2016, {{an article}} written by Diana C. Mutz compares the {{politics}} of Harry Potter to the 2016 Donald Trump presidential campaign. She states that 3 themes throughout the books are widely predominant '1) the value of tolerance and respect for difference; 2) opposition to violence and punitiveness; and 3) the dangers of authoritarianism.' She suggests that these themes are also present {{in the presidential election}} and it may {{play a significant role in}} how Americans <b>have</b> <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> the campaign.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} years of World WarII, Australia's {{military}} strategy was closely aligned with that of the United Kingdom's imperial defence policy. The Singapore strategy, which seemingly negated the need for large-scale land forces in the Pacific, was a key component of this policy and consequently most Australian military units that were deployed overseas in 1940 and 1941 were sent to the Mediterranean and Middle East where they formed {{an integral part of the}} Commonwealth forces in the area. The three AIF infantry divisions dispatched to the Middle East were subsequently heavily involved in the fighting that followed. In addition to the force which was sent to North Africa, two AIF brigades (the 18th and 25th) were stationed in Britain from June1940 to January1941 and formed part of the British mobile reserve which would <b>have</b> <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> any German landings. An Australian Army forestry group also served in Britain between 1940 and 1943.|$|E

5|$|Hogarth {{exhibited}} the painting at the Society of Artists in Spring Gardens in 1761. Although press reports – perhaps placed by Hogarth {{and his supporters}} – were enthusiastic, Sigismunda mourning over the Heart of Guiscardo was attacked by critics who marked Hogarth's attempt to emulate the drama depicted in older Italian paintings as foolhardy and ridiculous. Many critics were repulsed by the shocking contrast between the melancholy beauty of Sigismunda and the grotesquely bloody organ that she delicately touched. It was said that Hogarth placed an attendant next to the painting to note the remarks made by the viewers; changes to the painting suggest that he may <b>have</b> <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> these criticisms by altering his work, although {{it is impossible to}} ascertain whether many of the changes were made before or after the painting was exhibited.|$|E

25|$|A {{particularly}} prominent {{criticism of}} strong reciprocity {{theory is that}} it does not correspond to behavior found in the actual environment. In particular, the existence of third party punishment in the field is called into question. Some <b>have</b> <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> this criticism by pointing out that if effective, third party punishment will rarely be used, and will therefore be difficult to observe. Others have suggested that there is evidence of third party costly punishment in the field. Critics <b>have</b> <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> these claims by arguing that it is unfair for proponents to argue that both a demonstration of costly third party punishment as well as a lack of costly third party punishment are both evidence of its existence. They also question whether the ethnographic evidence presented is costly third party punishment, and call for additional analysis of the costs and benefits of the punishment. Other research has shown that different types of strong reciprocity do not predict other types of strong reciprocity within individuals.|$|E
