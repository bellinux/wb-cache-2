60|$|Let us now {{bring our}} {{conclusion}} {{to the test}} of the Method of Difference. Setting out from the cases already mentioned, in which the antecedent {{is the presence of}} substances forming with the tissues a compound incapable of putrefaction, (and a fortiori incapable of the chemical actions which constitute life), and the consequent is death, either of the whole organism, or of some portion of it; let us compare with these cases other cases, as much resembling them as possible, but in which that effect is not produced. And, first, “many insoluble basic salts of arsenious acid are known not to be poisonous. The substance called alkargen, discovered by Bunsen, which contains a very large quantity of arsenic, and approaches very closely in composition to the organic arsenious compounds found in the body, has not the slightest <b>injurious</b> <b>action</b> upon the organism.” Now when these substances are brought into contact with the tissues in any way, they do not combine with them; they do not arrest their progress to decomposition. As far, therefore, as these instances go, it appears that when the effect is absent, it is by reason of the absence of that antecedent which we had already good ground for considering as the proximate cause.|$|E
60|$|Subsequently to my experiments, M. Martens tried similar ones, {{but in a}} {{much better}} manner, for he placed the seeds in a box in the actual sea, so that they were {{alternately}} wet and exposed to the air like really floating plants. He tried 98 seeds, mostly different from mine; but he chose many large fruits and likewise seeds from plants which live near the sea; and this would have favoured the average length of their flotation and of their resistance to the <b>injurious</b> <b>action</b> of the salt-water. On the other hand he did not previously dry the plants or branches with the fruit; and this, as we have seen, would have caused some of them to have floated much longer. The result was that 18/98 of his seeds floated for 42 days, and were then capable of germination. But I do not doubt that plants exposed to the waves would float for a less time than those protected from violent movement as in our experiments. Therefore it would perhaps be safer to assume that the seeds of about 10/100 plants of a flora, after having been dried, could be floated across a space of sea 900 miles in width, and would then germinate. The fact of the larger fruits often floating longer than the small, is interesting; as plants with large seeds or fruit could hardly be transported by any other means; and Alph. de Candolle has shown that such plants generally have restricted ranges.|$|E
60|$|Fritz Muller {{observed}} the poisonous {{action of the}} plant's own pollen in the above-mentioned Oncidium flexuosum, O. unicorne, pubes (?), and in two other unnamed species. Also in two species of Rodriguezia, in two of Notylia, in one of Burlingtonia, and of a fourth genus in the same group. In all these cases, except the last, it was proved that the flowers were, as might have been expected, fertile with pollen from a distinct plant of the same species. Numerous flowers of one species of Notylia were fertilised with pollen from the same raceme; in two days' time they all withered, the germens began to shrink, the pollen-masses became dark brown, and not one pollen-grain emitted a tube. So that in this orchid the <b>injurious</b> <b>action</b> of the plant's own pollen is more rapid than with Oncidium flexuosum. Eight other flowers on the same raceme were fertilised with pollen from a distinct plant of the same species: two of these were dissected, and their stigmas {{were found to be}} penetrated by numberless pollen-tubes; and the germens of the other six flowers became well developed. On a subsequent occasion many other flowers were fertilised with their own pollen, and all fell off dead in a few days; whilst some flowers on the same raceme which had been left simply unfertilised adhered and long remained fresh. We have seen that in cross-unions between extremely distinct orchids the pollen long remains undecayed; but Notylia behaved in this respect differently; for when its pollen was placed on the stigma of Oncidium flexuosum, both the stigma and pollen quickly became dark brown, {{in the same manner as}} if the plant's own pollen had been applied.|$|E

I estimated (chiefly from the greatly reduced numbers of nests in the spring) that the winter of 1854-5 destroyed four-fifths of the birds in my own grounds; and this is a tremendous destruction, when we remember that ten per cent. is an extraordinarily severe mortality from epidemics with man. The action of climate seems at first sight to be quite independent of the struggle for existence; but in so far as climate chiefly acts in reducing food, it brings on the most severe struggle between the individuals, whether of the same or of distinct species, which subsist on the same kind of food. Even when climate, for instance, extreme cold, acts directly, it will be the least vigorous individuals, or those which have got least food through the advancing winter, which will suffer the most. When we travel from south to north, or from a damp region to a dry, we invariably see some species gradually getting rarer and rarer, and finally disappearing; and the change of climate being conspicuous, we are tempted to attribute the whole effect to its direct action. But this is a false view; we forget that each species, even where it most abounds, is constantly suffering enormous destruction at some period of its life, from enemies or from competitors for the same place and food; and if these enemies or competitors be in the least degree favoured by any slight change of climate, they will increase in numbers; and as each area is already fully stocked with inhabitants, the other species must decrease. When we travel southward and see a species decreasing in numbers, we may feel sure that the cause lies quite as much in other species being favoured, as in this one being hurt. So it is when we travel northward, but in a somewhat lesser degree, for the number of species of all kinds, and therefore of competitors, decreases northward; hence in going northward, or in ascending a mountain, we far oftener meet with stunted forms, due to the DIRECTLY <b>injurious</b> <b>action</b> of climate, than we do in proceeding southward or in descending a mountain. When we reach the Arctic regions, or snow-capped summits, or absolute deserts, the struggle for life is almost exclusively with the elements.|$|E

Afterwards I tried some larger fruits, capsules, etc., and some of these floated for a long time. It is well known what a difference there is in the buoyancy of green and seasoned timber; and it occurred to me that floods might wash down plants or branches, and that these might be dried on the banks, and then by a fresh rise in the stream be washed into the sea. Hence I was led to dry stems and branches of 94 plants with ripe fruit, and to place them on sea water. The majority sank quickly, but some which whilst green floated for a very short time, when dried floated much longer; for instance, ripe hazel-nuts sank immediately, but when dried, they floated for 90 days and afterwards when planted they germinated; an asparagus plant with ripe berries floated for 23 days, when dried it floated for 85 days, and the seeds afterwards germinated: the ripe seeds of Helosciadium sank in two days, when dried they floated for above 90 days, and afterwards germinated. Altogether out of the 94 dried plants, 18 floated for above 28 days, and some of the 18 floated for a very much longer period. So that as 64/87 seeds germinated after an immersion of 28 days; and as 18/94 plants with ripe fruit (but not all the same species as in the foregoing experiment) floated, after being dried, for above 28 days, as far as we may infer anything from these scanty facts, we may conclude that the seeds of 14/100 plants of any country might be floated by sea-currents during 28 days, and would retain their power of germination. In Johnston's Physical Atlas, the average rate of the several Atlantic currents is 33 miles per diem (some currents running at the rate of 60 miles per diem); on this average, the seeds of 14/100 plants belonging to one country might be floated across 924 miles of sea to another country; and when stranded, if blown to a favourable spot by an inland gale, they would germinate.|$|E
40|$|The term "state-corporate crime" first {{appeared}} in 1990, when Kramer and Michalowski (2006, p 15) defined this phenomenon as signifying "illegal or socially <b>injurious</b> <b>actions</b> that occur when one or more institutions of political governance pursue a goal in direct co-operation {{with one or more}} institutions of economic production and distribution". For Michalowski, Kramer and other scholars, state-corporate crime and harm can be initiated and facilitated by states. Thus, corporations engage in illegality at the prompt, or with the approval, of state institutions, while state actors fail to prevent or respond to, or, indeed, collude with, such illegality. More recently, Lasslett (2010, para 4) has usefully expanded upon this concept thus: "Corporate-initiated state crime occurs when corporations directly employ their economic power to coerce states into taking deviant actions". "Corporate-facilitated state crime" occurs"hen corporations either provide the means for state's criminality (e. g. weapons sales), or when they fail to alert the domestic/international community to the state's criminality, because these deviant practices directly/indirectly benefit the corporation concerned" (Lasslett, 2010, para 4).

Upon their arrival on the U. S. {{side of the border}}, these individuals are treated as criminal suspects. They are held in immigration detention facilities, interrogated and categorised as inadmissible ‘economic migrants’ or ‘drug offenders’ only to be denied asylum status and deported to dangerous and violent zones in Mexico.

The ranges considered-selected because they did not receive much attention from the cryobiol~gists as factors of injury-are: (I) the range of the glass transition, in the case of vitrifiable material (even if vitrification is only partial); (2) the range of maximal nucleation rate; (3) the range of maximal Tate of crystal growth; the combined action of these two rates may affect considerably the degree of injury; furthermore, the partly amorphous material may become unstable and crystallize, or recrystallize, in those two ranges, during rewarming; (4) the range of recrystallization.

The overarching hypothesis of this project is that cigarette smoke has different <b>injurious</b> <b>actions</b> on alveolar cells based on chronological age. The purpose here was {{to learn more about the}} susceptibility of alveolar cells to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) - induced injury by performing studies on pulmonary alveolar and endothelial cells derived from neonatal, young, and old rats. The aims involved: 1. Developing cell culture models to study age-related effects of cigarette smoke on alveolar type I cells and microvascular endothelial cells from the lung, and 2. Using these models to examine the effects of CSE on markers of oxidative stress, inflammation and aging in alveolar cells harvested from neonatal, young and old rats. Descriptive and experimental studies involved using a variety of cell culture, biochemical and molecular techniques, including gene expression arrays. The most significant findings were that: 1. primary proliferating alveolar type I cells were used to develop novel cell culture model systems, including single culture, co-culture and three-dimensional cultures that were used to study the effects of CSE; 2. Hydrogen peroxide production by endothelial cells was markedly reduced by co-culturing with AT I cells; 3. Gene expression profiling of oxidative stress-specific pathways suggest that genes responsible for both stopping production of H 2 O 2 or mopping-up H 2 O 2 are involved; and 4. Cigarette smoke shortens telomeres of cells from neonates, but unexpectedly preserves telomere length of cells from young and old rats. Data from telomeric pathway-specific gene expression arrays suggest that there are age-related differences in response to gene expression to CSE. The significant conclusions are: 1. Contrary to prior observations, alveolar type I cells demonstrate prolonged proliferative capacity; 2. Alveolar type I cells likely play an important role in ameliorating CSE-induced oxidative stress; and 3. Neonatal alveolar cells may be more susceptible to the deleterious effects of CSE including telomere shortening.

We measured HO- 1 activity in TNBS-induced colitis in rats and analyzed the severity of colitis along with altered HO activity by assessing lesion area and myeloperoxidase activity. HO- 1 mRNA and protein expressions were determined at different time points after TNBS induction. Free radical production and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which participate in oxidative injury, were also assayed. HO activity and HO- 1 gene expression increased markedly after TNBS induction. Administration with tin mesoporphyrin (SnMP), a HO inhibitor, potentiated the colonic damage along with a reduction in HO- 1 activity. Furthermore, the reduction of HO- 1 expression by SnMP also enhanced reactive oxygen species and iNOS expression, both of which were dramatically increased after the TNBS enema. L-Arginine preteatment further aggravated the <b>injurious</b> <b>action</b> of SnMP.

Such neutralization takes place through the intervention of growing tissue and is a property which is lacking in similar surviving tissue not in a state of cultivation. Thus, it appears that the living, growing cells of the tissues neutralize or destroy limited quantities of toxin; only when the quantity of toxin exceeds a certain limit is its <b>action</b> <b>injurious...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{considered}} two {{alternatives for}} the proposed action to list largescale silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys harmandi) as an injurious species under the Lacey Act: 1) no action; and 2) adding all forms (diploid and triploid) of live largescale silver carp, gametes, eggs and hybrids. Two alternatives considered, but rejected from further analysis were 1) add all forms of live and dead largescale silver carp, gametes, eggs and hybrids {{to the list of}} injurious wildlife; and 2) adding only diploid (fertile) forms of live largescale silver carp, gametes, eggs and hybrids as <b>injurious</b> wildlife. This <b>action</b> is being considered {{in order to protect the}} welfare and survival of native wildlife and wildlife resources and the health and welfare of human beings from the potential negative impacts of largescale silver carp by adding them to the list of injurious wildlife and preventing their importation. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized under the Lacey Act (18 U. S. C. § 42, as amended) to prescribe by regulation those mammals, birds, fish (including mollusks and crustaceans), amphibians, reptiles, and the offspring or eggs of any of the aforementioned...|$|R
5000|$|Scientific testing {{revealed}} no traces of human blood in Shvarts's art studio, although a Yale official {{noted that it}} was impossible to determine if her project had been examined completely. [...] Yale sources claimed that Shvarts had admitted privately that the project was a fiction, but Shvarts said this was [...] "ultimately inaccurate" [...] and Peter Salovey, then dean of Yale College, announced Shvarts would not be allowed to display her work unless she also confessed publicly that it was [...] "a work of fiction."Shvarts avoided having to sign such a statement by subsequently submitting a different senior project to her department and graduated from Yale University in May, 2008. [...] She also denied that she had ever admitted to the University that her project was a hoax, although a Yale spokeswoman initially claimed that the denial was [...] "part of Shvarts's performance" [...] and that Shvarts had promised the University that she would deny having admitted the project was fake if the University stated so publicly.

40|$|Adverse drug {{reactions}} in liver involve {{formation of a}} reactive metabolic intermediary of the drug, binding of the intermediary to macromolecules in the cell, notably proteins in the plasma membrane, immunological response to these altered proteins and attack against hepatocytes bearing these altered proteins by immune mechanisms. At each step in this complex process many factors act to enhance or depress drug metabolism, metabolite disposition, macromolecular binding, neoantigen formation, and the cell mediated and humoral immune attack. The extent and direction of each step may be dose dependent but {{the complexity of the}} overall mechanism is so immense that predictability of hepatic drug reactions is unlikely in most instances. Adverse drug {{reactions in}}volving the liver were considered originally to be "idiosyncratic" in nature without further defining this term. When allergy became understood as an immunologic phenomenon, the reactions were felt {{to be the result of}} hypersensitivity with drugs acting as haptens. As more were seen, the reactions were classified into direct toxicity, cholestasis and viral hepatitis-like [1]. The first was described as the result of dose related <b>injurious</b> <b>action</b> of the drug leading to cell death, the second as the result of impairment of function of the bile secretory apparatus of the hepatocyte, rather than interference with bile flow by ductula...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose—Potential {{effects of}} regular alcohol {{consumption}} on atherogenesis are still controversial mainly {{due to the}} lack of prospective population-based studies. Methods—The Bruneck Study is a prospective population-based survey of atherosclerosis and its risk factors. The study population comprises a sex- and age-stratified random sample of men and women aged 40 to 79 years. Participation and follow-up were more than 90 % complete. Changes in carotid atherosclerosis between the 1990 baseline and the first follow-up in 1995 were monitored by high-resolution duplex ultrasonography. Alcohol intake was quantified with a standardized questionnaire and prospective diet records. Results—Alcohol consumption less than once a week (occasional drinking) had no effect on atherogenesis. The association between regular alcohol intake and incident carotid atherosclerosis (early atherogenesis) was J-shaped, with light drinkers facing a lower risk than either heavy drinkers or abstainers. Protection offered by alcohol consumption of, 50 g/d appeared to act through inhibition of the <b>injurious</b> <b>action</b> of high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Excess risk of incident atherosclerosis observed among heavy alcohol consumers ($ 100 g/d) clearly surpassed the risk burden afforded by heavy smoking. The association between regular alcohol intake and incident carotid stenosis (advanced atherogenesis) was U-shaped. Odds ratios were generally shifted toward protection and did not rely on LDL cholesterol levels. We failed to find any differential effects of alcohol from various sources. All associations remained independently significant when we adjuste...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} my thesis is to {{determine}} the moral responsibility of soldiers in war. My theoretical framework is that of the just war tradition, a major moral tradition that holds that war can be evaluated according to certain moral rules. The concept of moral responsibility is discussed thoroughly. I argue that an agent can be regarded as a responsible person if he has a capacity for effective deliberation. A central question, then, is whether soldiers generally have such a capacity in war. Further, I claim that an agent can be held responsible for a particular <b>injurious</b> <b>action</b> if he acted freely and knowingly. Following Augustine, Francisco de Vitoria, and Michael Walzer, I conceive of war as a state in which moral choice is possible. Likewise, I argue that we tend to judge actions in war as more and less just. Hence, I argue that the conditions for holding someone responsible are applicable in war. Further, I claim that all soldiers, independently of rank, may have to make decisions in war. A major concern is to define and delimit their responsibility more closely. In this regard, I make a distinction between being morally responsible and being culpable. To be morally responsible does not necessarily imply that one is culpable, neither morally nor legally, for a particular harm. Thus, not all of our judgments of responsibility can be translated into judgments of legal responsibility...|$|E
40|$|In recent European {{animal welfare}} statutes, human <b>actions</b> <b>injurious</b> to animals are new “offences” {{articulated}} as {{an injury to}} societal norms in addition to property damage. A crime is foremost a violation of a community moral standard. Violating a societal norm puts society out of balance and justice is served when that balance is returned. Criminal law normally requires the presence of mens rea, or evil intent, a particular state of mind; however, dereliction of duties towards animals (or children) is usually described as being of varying levels of negligence but, rarely can be so egregious that it constitutes criminal societal injury. In instrumental justice, the “public goods” delivered by criminal law are commonly classified as retribution, incapacitation and general deterrence. Prevention is a small, if present, outcome of criminal justice. Quazi-criminal law intends to establish certain expected (moral) standards of human behavior where by statute, the obligations of one party to another are clearly articulated as strict liability. Although largely moral in nature, this class of laws focuses on achieving compliance, thereby resulting in prevention. For example, protecting the environment from degradation is a benefit to society; punishing non-compliance, as is the application of criminal law, will not prevent the injury. This paper will provide evidence that the integrated meat complex of Canada and the USA {{is not in a}} good position to make changes to implement a credible farm animal protection system...|$|R
40|$|Luminal {{levels of}} nitric oxide/nitrite {{are high in}} colitis. Whether nitric oxide is {{injurious}} or protective to human colonocytes is unknown {{and the role of}} nitric oxide in the genesis of colitis unclear. The aims were to establish whether nitric oxide was injurious to oxidation of substrates (n-butyrate and D-glucose) in isolated human and rat colonocytes both alone and in the presence of hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen peroxide, agents implicated in cell damage of colitis. Nitric oxide generation from S-nitrosoglutathione was measured by nitrite appearance. Colonocytes were isolated and incubated with [1 - 14 C] butyrate or [6 - 14 C] glucose and 2. 6 microM nitric oxide, 1. 5 mM sodium hydrogen sulfide or 2. 5 mM hydrogen peroxide. Acyl-CoA esters were measured by high performance liquid chromatography, 14 CO 2 radiochemically and lactate/ketones by enzymic methods. Results indicate that nitric oxide very significantly (p <. 001) reduced acyl-CoA formation but did not impair 14 CO 2 generation. Peroxide and sulfide with nitric oxide resulted in significant reduction (p < 0. 01) of substrate oxidation to CO 2. Sulfide significantly stimulated release of nitric oxide from S-nitrosoglutathione. The principal conclusion is that nitric oxide diminishes CoA metabolism in colonocytes. CoA depletion has been observed in chronic human colitis for which a biochemical explanation has been lacking. For acute <b>injurious</b> <b>action</b> in human colonocytes nitric oxide requires co-action of peroxide and sulfide to impair oxidation of substrates in cells. From current observations treatment of colitis should aim to reduce simultaneously nitric oxide, peroxide and sulfide generation in the colon...|$|E
40|$|Spirilla of {{identical}} morphological and cultural characters have been isolated in pure culture from the fetuses of fourteen cases of abortion. The {{condition of the}} fetus {{is much the same}} whether spirilla or the bacilli of abortion are present. This condition is probably due in both cases to interference with the placental circulation. The <b>injurious</b> <b>action</b> of the etiological factor when spirilla are present is limited to the fetal membranes, more particularly the chorion. Definite lesions of the fetus were not detected. The spirilla gain access to the digestive and respiratory organs of the fetus when the latter swallows the amniotic fluid. More rarely they are disseminated through the body, probably through the circulation. The spirilla will grow in certain culture media only under reduced oxygen tension, readily secured by sealing the ordinary culture tubes with sealing wax. Laboratory animals (mammals) are refractory. The precise relation of the spirillum to the pathologic process remains to be more definitely formulated. Since the spirillum was first isolated, twenty-seven cases have been found associated with Bacillus abortus and fourteen with the spirillum. In none was a mixed infection with both organisms detected. The spirillum has been isolated only from the second or succeeding pregnancies. Table I summarizes the data collected thus far. It gives by. number the male and shows that the spirillum is not associated with any one bull. The spirillum has been found in fetuses of various ages as shown in Column 3. The distribution of spirilla as shown by cultures is given, the sign + indicating pure cultures, the sign no growth. The guinea pig inoculations are shown to be uniformly negative as regards Bacillus abortus...|$|E
