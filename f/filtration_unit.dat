40|$|The {{influence}} of portable HEPA <b>filtration</b> <b>units</b> on {{the composition and}} levels of airborne fungi in the bedrooms of asthmatic children was investigated over a 15 -week study period. Reductions in airborne indoor fungal levels (70 %) and particulate matter (38 %) were achieved in homes fitted with the portable HEPA <b>filtration</b> <b>units.</b> Although the total numbers of indoor fungi were reduced after {{the installation of the}} HEPA <b>filtration</b> <b>units,</b> the variety of fungal genera remained relatively unchanged, reflecting a similar species range as that of outdoor air. In combination, the use of portable HEPA air <b>filtration</b> <b>units,</b> regular maintenance of both filter material and carpets, and a general awareness of indoor air issues, such as ventilation and source control, could aid in reducing exposure to airborne indoor fungi in residential environments...|$|R

50|$|There is a {{tendency}} with lamella clarifiers for algae to grow on the inclined plates and {{this can be a}} problem especially if the overflow is being discharged to the environment or if the lamella clarifier is being utilised as pre-treatment for a membrane <b>filtration</b> <b>unit.</b> In either of these cases the overflow requires post-treatment such as an anthracite-sand filter to prevent the algae from spreading downstream of the lamella clarifier. As the inclined plates in the lamella clarifier are made of steel it is not recommended that chlorine be used to control the biological growth as it could accelerate the corrosion of the plates.|$|E

50|$|The main {{operations}} block, {{often called}} a Happidrome, was {{the hub of}} the complex and it was from here that underground cables ran to the various transmitters and receivers in the surrounding areas. These included height finding equipment, plan and position indicators and machinery for the identification of friend and foe signals sent by incoming aircraft. The information obtained was collated in the operations room and relayed to the fighter stations at Drem and the training unit at Charterhall.Although staff were not billeted at the station it was largely self-sufficient with its own water supply, sewage treatment plant, generator house and telephone exchange. Welfare facilities included canteens, showers and rest rooms.

40|$|Biofouling {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} factors that degrade the performance of reverse osmosis (RO) membranes during the desalination process. This study demonstrates that copper ion (Cu(II) or Cu(II) plus hydroxylamine (HA) to produce Cu(I)) in combination with norspermidine (Nspd) can effectively inactivate bacterial biofilms on RO membranes. The addition of Nspd inhibited the inactivation of planktonic P. aeruginosa cells by copper ion. However, with respect to the cells in biofilms (grown in CDC reactors), the use of Nspd enhanced the cell inactivation by copper ion; the addition of Nspd increased the inactivation efficacies of Cu(II) and Cu(Il) /HA against biofilm cells from 2. 4 to 3. 1 and from 1. 3 to 3. 5 (log inactivation in 1 h), respectively. Nspd disrupted extracellular polymeric substances (as evidenced by the removal of proteins and polysaccharides from biofilms), and it is believed to facilitate the penetration of copper ion into the biofilm matrix. These results, showed that the Cu(II) /HA/Nspd treatment also inactivated biofilms in pressurized cross-flow RO <b>filtration</b> <b>units,</b> resulting in partial recovery of permeate flux. However, pretreatment using Nspd (and the subsequent treatment by copper ion) was not as effective as the simultaneous use of Nspd and copper ion in both CDC reactors and cross-flow <b>filtration</b> <b>units...</b>|$|R

40|$|Free-living amoebae (FLA) {{belonging}} to Acanthamoeba spp., Naegleria fowleri, Balamuthia mandrillaris, and Sappinia pedata {{are known to}} cause infections in humans and animals leading to severe brain pathologies. Worldwide, warm aquatic environments {{have been found to}} be suitable habitats for pathogenic FLA. The present study reports on screening for potentially pathogenic FLA in four hot spring resorts in Switzerland. Water samples were taken from water <b>filtration</b> <b>units</b> and from the pools, respectively. Amoebae isolated from samples taken during, or before, the filtration process were demonstrated to be morphologically and phylogenetically related to Stenoamoeba sp., Hartmannella vermiformis, Echinamoeba exundans, and Acanthamoeba healyi. With regard to the swimming pools, FLA were isolated only in one resort, and the isolate was identified as non-pathogenic and as related to E. exundans. Further investigations showed that the isolates morphologically and phylogenetically related to A. healyi displayed a pronounced thermotolerance, and exhibited a marked in vitro cytotoxicity upon 5 -day exposure to murine L 929 fibroblasts. Experimental intranasal infection of Rag 2 -immunodeficient mice with these isolates led to severe brain pathologies, and viable trophozoites were isolated from the nasal mucosa, brain tissue, and lungs post mortem. In summary, isolates related to A. healyi were suggestive of being potentially pathogenic to immunocompromised persons. However, the presence of these isolates was limited to the <b>filtration</b> <b>units,</b> and an effective threat for health can therefore be excluded...|$|R
