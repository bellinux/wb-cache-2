5|$|Harley's co-creator, Paul Dini, {{describes}} {{their relationship}} as Harley being someone {{who makes the}} Joker <b>feel</b> <b>better</b> <b>about</b> himself, and who can do the work {{that he does not}} want to do himself. In the 1999 one-shot comic Batman: Harley Quinn, the Joker decides to kill Harley, after admitting that he does care for her, that their relationship is romantic, and that these feelings prevent him from fulfilling his purpose. Removing the traditional male-female relationship, such as in the Batman: Thrillkiller storyline where the Joker (Bianca Steeplechase) is a female and involved in a lesbian relationship with Harley, their relationship lacks any aspects of violence or subjugation.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn 2003, {{a public}} {{insurance}} system {{was introduced in}} Chinese rural areas. In the meantime, subjective health status improved. We used a unique household longitudinal survey to analyse how the introduction of an insurance system, known as the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS), {{has contributed to the}} change. This health insurance programme was launched sequentially over counties starting in 2003, and households voluntarily chose whether to participate the programme after its launch by the county. These characteristics make it feasible to disentangle two channels of the influence of the NCMS on self-reported health status. One is the insurance effect of the coverage, which can be estimated by comparing the insured households with non-participants in the villages located in counties that have launched the programme (NCMS counties); the other is the general equilibrium effect that affects all residents in the NCMS counties, and can be estimated by comparing non-participants with the non-exposed households. The longitudinal data also allow us to examine how the effect changes with the duration of households’ subscription to the programme. The empirical findings include: first, a positive extensive margin: an individual <b>feels</b> <b>better</b> <b>about</b> his or her health status when covered by the NCMS. However, there is no intensive margin: there is no additional gain in the self-assessment of health status with the individual’s number of years enrolled in the programme. Second, we find a positive general equilibrium effect of introducing the NCMS programme on non-participants in the NCMS county. This effect accumulates over time...|$|R
25|$|A {{study of}} {{elections}} {{has shown that}} the result of sports events can affect the overall results. A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showed that when the home team wins the game before the election, the incumbent candidates can increase their share of the vote by 1.5 percent, while a loss had the opposite effect. The study looked at NCAA football games from 1946 to 2008. In addition, the study found that colleges with higher attendance rates had a larger effect on the results, up to 3%. The effects are increased even further if the game is an upset, that is, if the team expected to win does not. Other studies have confirmed these results for other sports, such as baseball and basketball. The study authors concluded that the win made voters <b>feel</b> <b>better</b> <b>about</b> society, boosting votes for the incumbent, while losses made voters feel worse, sending votes to the challenger. There was some speculation that the result of certain games could even decide the 2012 United States presidential election.|$|E

While Homer's thoughtless antics often upset his family, he on many occasions has also revealed himself to be a very caring and loving father and husband: in [...] "Lisa the Beauty Queen", (season four, 1992) he sold his cherished ride on the Duff blimp and used the money to enter Lisa in a beauty pageant so she could <b>feel</b> <b>better</b> <b>about</b> herself; in [...] "Rosebud", (season five, 1993) he gave up his chance at wealth to allow Maggie to keep a cherished teddy bear, despite the show also occasionally implying Homer forgets he has a third child, while the episode [...] "And Maggie Makes Three" [...] suggests she is the chief reason Homer took and remains at his regular job (season six, 1995); in [...] "Radio Bart", (season three, 1992) he spearheaded an attempt to dig Bart out after he had fallen down a well; and in [...] "A Milhouse Divided", (season eight, 1996) he arranged a surprise second wedding with Marge to make up for their unsatisfactory first ceremony.

40|$|Do people <b>feel</b> <b>better</b> {{or worse}} <b>about</b> {{themselves}} {{when working with}} someone who is better than they are? We present the first replication of the work of Stapel and Koomen (2005) who showed that being in a competitive vs. cooperative mindset moderates the effects of social comparison on self-evaluation. In Experiment 1, we present a close replication of Stapel and Koomen (2005, Study 2). Participants in competition/cooperation had to self-evaluate after receiving information about the personal characteristics of an upward/downward comparison target. In Experiment 2, we went further by providing feedback about both the comparison target and the self. Our results and a small-scale meta-analysis combining our experiments and Stapel and Koomen’s confirm that a competitive/cooperative mindset moderates the impact of social comparison on self-evaluation; nevertheless, the effect size we found across the two experiments is clearly more modest than the one found in Stapel and Koomen’s work...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{importance}} of research, as {{promoted by the}} framework, is widely acknowledged. Many medical students in Germany work on a research project {{as part of their}} doctoral thesis whilst still going to medical school. However, a significant amount of projects are abandoned unfinished, which leads to substantial wastage of resources. One reason for this is an information deficit concerning undergraduate research projects. Project description: To counteract this, we introduced an annual event at LMU Munich called with more than 600 visitors each year. It combines medical convention and research fair including keynote lectures, workshops and poster sessions as well as an exhibition of research groups and institutes. is a peer-to-peer event organized by a team of 40 students. Results: A needs analysis before its implementation underlined the information deficit as a possible cause for the high rate of abandoned projects. In the annual evaluation, visitors of rate the event with an average grade of 2. 1 on a six-level Likert scale (n= 558, SD= 1. 06, with " 1 =very good", " 6 =poor"). They stated to now <b>feel</b> <b>better</b> informed <b>about</b> the topic and regarded visiting as a worthwhile investment of time. Discussion: Students are generally satisfied with the event and <b>feel</b> <b>better</b> informed after visiting. However, many students never visit DoktaMed for various reasons. A possible improvement would be to present a greater number of clinical studies in addition to the laboratory work that focuses on now. Conclusion: Evaluation after six years of is very promising. Visitors seem to be better informed. Nevertheless there is space for improvement in order to get more students and more faculty members involved.
