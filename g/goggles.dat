50|$|<b>Goggle</b> Jet (Gōguru Jetto) - <b>Goggle</b> Red's mecha. It {{is stored}} in <b>Goggle</b> Container 1, with wings retracted. It forms <b>Goggle</b> Robo's head and chest. It can shoot down Desfighters, but <b>Goggle</b> Red can also use its speed to outmaneuver them. Since it is a jet, it can take off while <b>Goggle</b> Caesar is still airborne.|$|R

5|$|Itala driver Maurice Fabry {{started the}} fastest of the competitors; {{he covered the}} first {{kilometre}} in 43.4seconds. Over the full distance of the lap Brasier's Baras was the quickest; his lap time of 52minutes and 25.4seconds (52:25.4) moved him up to third position {{on the road and}} into the lead overall. A mechanical problem caused Gabriel to lose control of his car at Saint-Calais; he regained control in time to avoid a serious accident but was forced to retire. Baras maintained his lead after the second lap, but fell back to second the next lap as Szisz took over the lead. As the day grew hotter—it reached a high of —the tar began to melt, which proved to be a greater problem than the dust; it was kicked up by the cars into the faces of the drivers and their mechanics, seeping past their <b>goggles</b> and inflaming their eyes. The Renault driver, J. Edmond, was particularly affected: his broken <b>goggles</b> allowed more tar to seep past and rendered him nearly blind. His attempts to change the <b>goggles</b> at a pit stop were rejected by officials on the grounds that equipment could not be replaced mid-race. Nor could another driver be substituted; he continued for two more laps before retiring.|$|E

5|$|No {{images of}} Murrell survive. Accounts {{describe}} him as a short man who walked with {{his hands behind his}} back and hummed as he went. He was also noted for wearing a hard hat, bobbed tale coat, and iron <b>goggles,</b> while carrying a whalebone umbrella and a basket into which he placed the herbs that he collected. His appearance reportedly scared local children, of whom he was nevertheless fond.|$|E
5|$|Preparedness for ashfalls should involve sealing buildings, {{protecting}} {{infrastructure and}} homes, and storing sufficient supplies {{of food and}} water to last until the ash fall is over and clean-up can begin. Dust masks can be worn to reduce inhalation of ash and mitigate against any respiratory health affects. <b>Goggles</b> can be worn to protect against eye irritation.|$|E
5|$|Ramírez had {{difficulty}} with his vision; {{he could not}} see which pitch the catcher was calling for. He was fitted for prescription <b>goggles,</b> which he continued to wear throughout his career. Angels' MLB players of the time did not remember working with Ramírez; catcher José Molina suggested that Ramírez must not have been in the Angels' long-term plans, as they had a number of right-handed power pitching relief pitchers in the organization.|$|E

5|$|At {{approximately}} 3:30am 20 SEALs {{and about}} 24 US Army Rangers from the 75th Ranger Regiment (wearing night-vision <b>goggles)</b> approached the compound, fast roping from two CH-47 Chinook helicopters. They were fired {{on from the}} compound and from a nearby position by Taliban armed with AK-47s, rocket-propelled grenades, and suicide vests. Two American snipers aboard a helicopter killed two guards using sound-suppressed rifles. An AC-130 Spectre gunship provided the US {{troops on the ground}} with close air support, killing two fleeing Taliban. The Rangers secured enemy positions on the nearby hills, and all six Taliban gunmen who fought the US forces were killed.|$|E
5|$|During the 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq, multiple Sea King ASaC7 from 849 NAS were operated from HMS Ark Royal. On 22 March 2003, two AEW Sea Kings from 849 NAS operating from Ark Royal collided over the Persian Gulf, {{resulting in the}} death of seven personnel. A report into the collision called for Sea Kings to be outfitted with night vision <b>goggles,</b> as well as better onboard safety equipment, and recommended changes to procedure regarding the use of radar at night.|$|E
5|$|Fielded in 1991, the Night Attack Harrier was {{the first}} upgrade of the AV-8B. It {{differed}} from the original aircraft in having a forward looking infrared (FLIR) camera added {{to the top of}} the nose cone, a wide Smiths Industries head-up display (HUD), provisions for night vision <b>goggles,</b> and a Honeywell digital moving map system. The FLIR uses thermal imaging to identify objects by their heat signatures. The variant was powered by the F402-RR-408 engine, which featured an electronic control system and was more powerful and reliable. The flare and chaff dispensers were moved, and the ram air intake was lengthened at the fin's base. Initially known as the AV-8D, the night-attack variant was designated the AV-8B(NA).|$|E

5|$|Italy has {{opted to}} extend the Tornado's service life {{at the expense of}} {{alternative}} ground-attack aircraft such as the AMX International AMX; in 2010 a major upgrade and life extension program was initiated, which will provide new digital displays, Link 16 communications capability, night-vision <b>goggles</b> compatibility, and several other upgrades. In the long term, it is planned to replace the Tornado IDS/ECR fleet in Italian service with the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, with the final Italian Tornado scheduled to be phased out in 2025.|$|E

5|$|No.285 Squadron {{generally}} holds two {{pilot and}} navigator conversion courses per year. Each six-month course includes approximately 120 {{hours in the}} FFMS and 30 hours in flying aircraft. It culminates in an airborne operation module, which includes formation flying, airdrops, night landings with night-vision <b>goggles,</b> and simulated combat utilising the C-130's self-defence systems to prepare the aircrew for conditions in Middle East deployments. Following this exercise, the new C-130 aircrew are posted to No.37 Squadron. No.285 Squadron may run 30 or more courses each year for ground support staff; these courses can last {{from one day to}} five weeks.|$|E
5000|$|The AN/PVS-5 is a dual-tube night-vision <b>goggle</b> {{used for}} {{aviation}} and ground support. It uses second-generation image-intensifier tubes which are poor for today's standards. The United States Army still has PVS-5 on supply but are very rarely used. The AN/PVS-5 {{is based on}} the SU-50 which was a first-generation night-vision <b>goggle</b> adapted by the United States Air Force in 1971. From 1972 until 1990 the AN/PVS-5 was the mainstay in United States Army night vision for aviation. The AN/PVS-5C was not approved for flight because of its auto-gated feature causing the <b>goggle</b> to shut off in bright light. For ground troops the AN/PVS-5 was the sole night-vision <b>goggle</b> until the adaptation of the improved AN/PVS-7.|$|R

Fumi Nakashima, the sub-character chief designer, concentrated on giving characters from different regions and cultures distinct styles of clothing.

5|$|To avoid a {{potentially}} vigorous chemical reaction, barium metal {{is kept in}} an argon atmosphere or under mineral oils. Contact with air is dangerous and may cause ignition. Moisture, friction, heat, sparks, flames, shocks, static electricity, and exposure to oxidizers and acids should be avoided. Anything that may contact with barium should be electrically grounded. Anyone who works with the metal should wear pre-cleaned non-sparking shoes, flame-resistant rubber clothes, rubber gloves, apron, <b>goggles,</b> and a gas mask. Smoking in the working area is forbidden. Thorough washing is required after handling barium.|$|E
