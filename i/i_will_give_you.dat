Convinced that he cannot {{achieve a}} decent status in Paris without a considerable display of wealth, he writes {{to his family}} and asks them to send him money: [...] "Sell some of your old jewelry, my kind mother; <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> other jewels very soon." [...] They do send him the money he requests, and– although it is not described directly in the novel– endure significant hardship for themselves as a result. His family, absent while he is in Paris, becomes even more distant despite this sacrifice. Although Goriot and Vautrin offer themselves as father figures to him, {{by the end of the}} novel they are gone and he is alone.|$|E
500|$|The next track [...] "Incredible" [...] {{starts off}} like a love song but reveals itself to be a plea to someone to start over, while {{changing}} its composition from the interlude. According to MTV, the shift in the structure reflected Madonna's own confusion about how she felt about her lover in the song. [...] "Can't get my head around it", she sang. [...] "I, I {{need to think about}} it." [...] "Beat Goes On" [...] featuring West, has a 70s R meeting 80s dance vibe and a rap interlude by West. Williams has commented that Madonna's work ethic was different from other artists that he had worked with before. That is reflected in songs like [...] "Spanish Lesson" [...] where she sings the line [...] "If you do your homework/ Baby <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> more". It also has influences of Spanish music. Groove inspired music is present in [...] "Dance 2Night", which featured Timberlake.|$|E
500|$|To {{ward off}} the threat of vampires and disease, twin {{brothers}} would yoke twin oxen to a plow and make a furrow with it around their village. An egg would be broken and a nail driven into the floor beneath the bier {{of the house of}} a recently deceased person. Two or three elderly women would attend the cemetery the evening after the funeral and stick five hawthorn pegs or old knives into the grave: one at the position of the deceased's chest, and the other four at the positions of his arms and legs. Other texts maintain that running backwards uphill with a lit candle and a turtle would ward off a stalking vampire. Alternately, they may surround the grave with a red woolen thread, ignite the thread, and wait until it was burnt up. If a noise was heard at night and suspected to be made by a vampire sneaking around someone's house, one would shout [...] "Come tomorrow, and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> some salt," [...] or [...] "Go, pal, get some fish, and come back." ...|$|E

Nestled in rolling woodland, the house was a Usonian home with concrete floors coated with red-colored wax, piano hinges on the doors, and radiant heating.

The bowlers were Bill Bowes, Hedley Verity, Frank Smailes, Emmott Robinson and Cyril Turner. He hit seven sixes (all off Verity) and nine fours. In two overs by Verity, Bartlett scored 062660 and 006606. The last six was his final scoring shot {{as he tried}} to hit Smailes over long off and was caught by Maurice Leyland [...] "with his heels on the boundary and left hand outstretched".

At least three other crewmembers, as well as the Duff Gordons, Salomon and Stengel, denied hearing any suggestion to go back or opposing any proposition to do so. In the media later, the Duff Gordons in particular were widely criticised for what was interpreted as their callousness {{in the face of the}} disaster. For instance, as Titanic sank, Lucile reportedly commented to her secretary: [...] "There is your beautiful nightdress gone." [...] Fireman Pusey replied that she shouldn't worry about losing her belongings because she could buy more.

I asked Elvy if she would let me squeeze four years of math into my junior and senior years at Lewis & Clark. To imagine her thoughts, {{you have to remember that}} I had not even taken a course in freshman calculus. I didn't then know what Elvy was thinking. I only knew what she said and what she did. She went to a bookshelf in her office in the old math building, scanned the titles, took down a calculus text, handed it to me, and said, 'Study this book during the summer. The week before classes start in the fall, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a test. If you pass, I will let you take your sophomore and junior mathematics courses concurrently. By the time you reach your senior year, you will be on track.' [...] Years later, Elvy told me that she had no idea I would actually do it.
