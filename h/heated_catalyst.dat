Investigation of temperature effects on dolomite activity between 650 ?C and 950 C bed temperatures, showed optimum catalytic efficiency at approximately 850 ?C. At the optimum conditions, gravimetric tar and particulate concentrations in syngas produced from pine pellets were 0. 85 g/Nm 3 (± 0. 16) and 4. 75 g/Nm 3 (± 0. 07), respectively before gas conditioning, and 0. 09 g/Nm 3 (± 0. 02) and 2. 01 g/Nm 3 (± 0. 13), respectively after gas conditioning. Syngas from wood chips contained 1. 63 g/Nm 3 (± 0. 45) and 3. 84 g/Nm 3 (± 1. 16) of tars and particulates, respectively before gas cleaning and 0. 19 g/Nm 3 (± 0. 02) and 2. 27 g/Nm 3 (± 0. 27) tars and particulates, respectively after gas conditioning.

It is hypothesized the light-off temperature and corresponding preheat power required for microthrusters using HAN-based monopropellants decrease with decreasing droplet size. The viscous nature of this propellant, however, creates significant challenges in its atomization. Having developed a means to control the droplet size down to 50 micrometers in diameter, experiments are proceeding with a laboratory-scale workhorse thruster apparatus designed for the operation in the 0. 1 to 1 Newton thrust range.

40|$|A {{facility}} for investigating catalytic combustion and measurement of fuel molecule concentration {{was built to}} examine catalyst candidates for inerting systems in aircraft. The facility consists of fuel and oxygen supplies, a catalytic-bed reactor, heating system, and laser-based diagnostics. Two supplementary systems consisting of a calibration test cell and a nitrogen-purged glove box were also constructed. The catalyst under investigation was platinum, and it was mixed with silica particles to increase the surface area available to react. The catalyst/silica mixture {{was placed in a}} narrow channel section of the reactor and supported from both sides by glass wool. The fuels investigated were n-octane and n-nonane because their vapor pressure is sufficiently high to create ammable gaseous mixtures with atmospheric air at room temperature. Calibration experiments were performed to determine the absorption cross-section of the two fuels as a function of temperature.

However, further tests are required to produce oxidation at sufficiently low temperature to comply with aircraft safety regulations. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} heating a {{foam-based}} catalyst bed {{has been developed}} using silicon carbide as the catalyst support due to its readily accessible, high surface area that is oxidation-resistant and is electrically conductive. The foam support may be resistively heated by passing an electric current through it. This allows the catalyst bed to be heated directly, requiring less power to reach the desired temperature more quickly. Designed for heterogeneous catalysis, the method {{can be used by}} the petrochemical, chemical processing, and power-generating industries, as well as automotive catalytic converters. Catalyst beds must be heated to a light-off temperature before they catalyze the desired reactions. This typically is done by heating the assembly that contains the catalyst bed, which results in much of the power being wasted and/or lost to the surrounding environment. The catalyst bed is heated indirectly, thus requiring excessive power. With the electrically <b>heated</b> <b>catalyst</b> bed, virtually all of the power is used to heat the support, and only a small fraction is lost to the surroundings. Although the light-off temperature of most catalysts is only a few hundred degrees Celsius, the electrically heated foam is able to achieve temperatures of 1, 200 C. Lower temperatures are achievable by supplying less electrical power to the foam. Furthermore, because of the foam s open-cell structure, the catalyst can be applied either directly to the foam ligaments or {{in the form of a}} catalyst- containing washcoat.

40|$|In recent years, {{interest}} in air pollution constituents {{has focused on}} carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons as prime components of polluted air. Instrumental methods have been developed, and commercial instruments for continuous monitoring of these components have been available {{for a number of}} years. For the measurement of carbon monoxide, non-dispersive infrared spectroscopy has been the accepted tool, in spite of its marginal sensitivity at low parts-per-million levels. For continuously monitoring total hydrocarbons, the hydrogen flame ionization analyzer has been widely accepted as the preferred method. The inadequacy of this latter method became evident when it was concluded that methane is non-reactive and cannot be considered a contaminant even though present at over 1 ppm in the earth's atmosphere. Hence, the need for measuring methane separately became apparent as a means of measuring the reactive and potentially harmful non-methane hydrocarbons fraction. A gas chromatographic method for the measurement of methane and total hydrocarbons which met these requirements has been developed. In this technique, methane was separated on conventional gas chromatographic columns and detected by a hydrogen flame ionization detector (FID) while the total hydrocarbons were obtained by introducing a second sample directly into the FID without separating the various components. The reactive, or non-methane hydrocarbons, were determined by difference. Carbon monoxide was also measured after converting to methane over a <b>heated</b> <b>catalyst</b> to render it detectable by the FID. The development of this method made it possible to perform these measurements with a sensitivity of as much as 1 ppm full scale and a minimum detectability of 20 ppb.

Volume- and mass- based power density are two of the most important performance metrics for portable power sources, including hydrogen generating fuel reforming systems (onboard) for hydrogen fuel cells. Two innovative multifunctional reactor concepts, CO 2 /H 2 Active Membrane Piston (CHAMP) and Direct Droplet Impingement Reactor (DDIR), are combined for the purpose of hydrogen generating fuel reforming system (onboard) for fuel cells. In CHAMP-DDIR, a liquid fuel mixture is pulse-injected onto the <b>heated</b> <b>catalyst</b> surface for rapid flash volatilization and on-the-spot reaction, and a hydrogen selective membrane is collocated with the catalyst to reduce the diffusion distance for hydrogen transport from the reaction zone to the separation site. CHAMP-DDIR allows dynamic variation of the reactor volume to optimally control the residence time and reactor conditions, such as pressure and temperature, thus improving both the reaction and separation processes. A comprehensive CHAMP-DDIR model, which couples key physical processes including 1) catalytic chemical reactions, 2) hydrogen separation/permeation at membrane, 3) liquid fuel evaporation, and 4) heat and mass transport, has been developed to investigate the behavior of this novel reactor system, aiming at maximizing the volumetric power density of hydrogen generation from methanol/water liquid fuel. The relationships between system design parameters and the rate-limiting process(es), i. e., reaction, permeation, and transport, which govern reactor output, have identified. Experimental characterization of the prototype reactor has been performed for laboratory demonstration of the concept and model validation. Both model predictions and experiments successfully demonstrate the unique practical performance improvements of CHAMP-DDIR through combining time-modulated fuel introduction and the active change of reactor volume/pressure.
