25|$|First {{reports on}} an {{association}} of spinal cord and optic nerve disorders appeared in the early 19th century. However, only an 1870 report by Sir Thomas Clifford Allbutt created sustained interest of neurologists and ophthalmologists in this rare syndrome. In 1894, Eugène <b>Devic</b> and his PhD student Fernand Gault described 16 patients who had lost vision in one or both eyes and within weeks developed severe spastic weakness of the limbs, loss of sensation and often bladder control. They recognized these symptoms {{were the result of}} inflammation of the optic nerve and spinal cord, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2012, Shevchenko {{was named}} in the Ukrainian squad for Euro 2012. In Ukraine's opening game, Shevchenko scored two headers to beat Sweden 2–1 in Group D. In Ukraine's final game, against England, Marko <b>Dević</b> scored a [...] "ghost goal" [...] in the second half, with Ukraine losing 1–0 to a Wayne Rooney goal. Dević's shot was hooked clear from behind the England {{goal-line}} by Shevchenko's former Chelsea teammate John Terry under {{the eyes of the}} additional assistant referee standing beside the goal (as confirmed by video replays). The incident reopened football's goal-line technology debate. Replays, however, also showed Artem Milevskiy should have been ruled offside before Dević's shot. After this game, Shevchenko announced he would retire from international football, having been Ukraine's youngest and oldest goalscorer and record marksman with 48 goals in 111 appearances.|$|E

25|$|Whether <b>Devic's</b> {{disease is}} a {{distinct}} disease {{or part of the}} wide spectrum of multiple sclerosis is debated. <b>Devic's</b> disease differs in that it usually has more severe sequelae after an acute episode than standard MS, MS infrequently presents as transverse myelitis, and oligoclonal bands in the CSF, as well as white matter lesions on brain MRI, are uncommon in <b>Devic's</b> disease, but occur in over 90% of MS patients.|$|R
40|$|Neuromyelitis optica or <b>Devic’s</b> {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} autoimmune disorder which is characterized by inflammatory demyelination of the optic nerves and the spinal cord. Clinically, it causes visual loss in one or both eyes, and numbness or paralysis of the arms and legs. Although tonic spasm is the most frequent movement disorder occuring in MS, {{it has not been}} definetely described clinical entity for <b>Devic’s</b> syndrome. We hereby describe a case of <b>Devic’s</b> syndrome with tonic spasms treated with levetiracetam as a new approach and discussed the results of the treatment. A 52 -year-old woman with <b>Devic’s</b> syndrome with the complaint of painful tonic spasms primarily affecting the abdomen was given levetiracetam therapy. Levetiracetam therapy resulted in a good response in our patient. Levetiracetam can be a new choice for the treatment of painful tonic spasm with <b>Devic’s</b> syndrome. However, more detailed studies are necessary to investigate efficacy of levetiracetam...|$|R
