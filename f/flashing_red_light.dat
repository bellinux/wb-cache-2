500|$|In {{the pilot}} episode of Drawn Together, Ling-Ling, {{who is a}} parody of Pikachu, states that his goal in the Drawn Together house is to [...] "destroy all, and give {{children}} seizures". There follows a scene with flashing lights, a direct reference to this episode. In So Yesterday, a novel by Scott Westerfeld, this episode is mentioned and shown {{to one of the}} characters. The <b>flashing</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> that caused the seizure is also used in the story telling elements.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, South Africa, and Canada, {{there are}} four-way intersections with {{a stop sign}} at every entrance, called four-way stops. [...] A failed signal or a <b>flashing</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> is {{equivalent}} to a four-way stop, or an all-way stop. Special rules for four-way stops may include: ...|$|E
2500|$|When the caution comes out, the {{pit lane}} is {{immediately}} closed, a rule first implemented following the 1989 Atlanta 500. This {{is shown by}} a <b>flashing</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> {{at the entrance to}} pit road. Entering pit road when it is closed (with certain exceptions) is a penalty of restarting {{at the rear of the}} field. [...] When pit road is open, a steady green light will appear at the entrance to pit road, and a green light will come on in the rear window of the pace vehicle.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Flashing</b> <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> are not {{generally}} allowed on vehicles, though many emergency vehicles have rear-facing <b>flashing</b> <b>red</b> <b>lights,</b> {{which are used}} to signify that the vehicle is stationary. These are, however, specifically prohibited by the Regulations. [...] Hazard lights may be wired to function at the same time, to make civilians further conscious of their presence. Fog lights may also be used in an alternating left/right pattern.|$|R

2500|$|The {{operation}} of a traffic signal while a train is present may differ from municipality to municipality. [...] In some areas, all directions will flash red, turning the intersection into an all-way stop. [...] In other areas, the traffic parallel to the railroad track will have a flashing yellow {{for the duration of}} the train while the other directions face a <b>flashing</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> {{for the duration of the}} train. Still in other areas, the traffic parallel to the railroad track will have a green light for the duration of the train while the other directions face a red light for the duration of the train.|$|E
2500|$|He reorganised the borough's fire brigade, and, {{among other}} police innovations, set up {{twelve of the}} then new [...] "police pillars", a network of two-way {{microphone}} handsets across the borough enabling the public to contact police stations and civil defence posts directly. The base of the pillar contained first aid equipment while, a Leamington innovation, a <b>flashing</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> on the top called up policemen on patrol. From Leamington onwards, Young possessed a marked capacity to persuade his police authority to increase its capital spending and a marked inclination to find technological help for the policeman. Seconded {{under the aegis of}} the Home Office for six months in November 1940 to Coventry after its blitz to run the city's police because the Chief Constable was fully occupied as Civil Defence Controller, he introduced there the [...] "good neighbour scheme" [...] for bombed out civilians that he had trialled in Leamington and which was later adopted nationally by the Home Office.|$|E
5000|$|A {{wing-in-ground craft}} must also display a bright all-round <b>flashing</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> when taking off, landing, or flying near the surface.|$|E
2500|$|There are 1390 {{public road}} level {{crossings}} in New Zealand, of which 275 crossings {{are protected by}} <b>flashing</b> <b>red</b> <b>lights,</b> bells, and half-arm barriers; and 421 are protected by <b>flashing</b> <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> and bells only. The remainder are controlled by [...] "Stop and Give Way" [...] signs. Level crossings are the responsibility of rail infrastructure owner KiwiRail Network, the NZ Transport Agency, and if the crossing is on a local road, the local city or district council.|$|R
5000|$|The {{basic signal}} {{consists}} of <b>flashing</b> <b>red</b> <b>lights,</b> a crossbuck and a bell, {{attached to a}} mast. At most crossings, the signals will activate about 30 seconds before the train arrives.|$|R
25|$|A near {{universal}} {{exception to}} this rule is school buses which are allowed to use rear and forward-facing, usually alternatively phased <b>flashing</b> <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> just before, during, and after passenger loading & unloading as a signal for all other traffic to stop.|$|R
5000|$|The {{closest thing}} to a traffic signal in Boise County is a <b>{{flashing}}</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> for Hwy 52 where it meets Highway 55, in Horsehoe Bend. Highway 55 has a flashing yellow.|$|E
50|$|It is {{the site}} of the only traffic signal (a <b>flashing</b> <b>red</b> <b>light)</b> in Sierra County. In the winter of 2007 it was removed after an {{automobile}} accident and was replaced in the fall of 2008.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{only one}} traffic signal (a <b>flashing</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> at the {{intersection}} of highways 49 and 89) in Sierra County. In the winter of 2007 it was removed after an automobile accident and was replaced in the fall of 2008.|$|E
50|$|Beacon <b>lights</b> are <b>flashing</b> <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> fitted {{on the top}} {{and bottom}} {{fuselage}} of an aircraft. Their purpose is to alert ground crew and other aircraft that an engine is starting up, running or shutting down, or that the aircraft is about to start moving. They spin to produce a flashing effect, increasing the chance they will be noticed.|$|R

Also seen are two antennae; the one seen between the two speakers is for a two-way radio, while the one seen {{in front of the}} flashing light on the left is probably for the vehicle's conventional AM/FM radio.|$|R
25|$|Police now {{use both}} {{red and blue}} Canada-wide (except where local laws prohibit), {{including}} Ontario (thanks to successful testing in Toronto and Ottawa, {{and changes in the}} provincial traffic act), where the color blue was only used for non-emergency work. Blue flashing lights are still permitted on snow removal vehicles in Ontario, {{as long as they are}} not used in conjunction with <b>flashing</b> <b>red</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|R

50|$|In mid 2007, {{technology}} and gaming blogs began reporting about new {{problems with the}} Xbox 360 losing video output. The problems are characterized by a blank, staticky, or grayscale video output with a proper functioning audio output and no <b>flashing</b> <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> on the console. The complete video failure is sometimes preceded by other graphical glitches such as an irregular saturation of green and/or red colors.|$|R
2500|$|As {{traffic on}} the road {{crossing}} or the rail crossing increases, safety features are increased accordingly. More heavily trafficked crossings have [...] "automatic warning devices" [...] (AWDs), with alternately <b>flashing</b> <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> to warn automobile drivers and a bell to warn pedestrians. Additional safety is attained through crossing gates that block automobiles' approach to the tracks when activated. Increasingly, crossings are being fitted with four-quadrant gates to prevent circumventing the gates.|$|R
2500|$|A level {{crossing}} near Gisborne, sees the Palmerston North - Gisborne Line cross one of Gisborne Airport's runways. [...] Aircraft landing on sealed 1310-metre runway 14L/32R are signalled with two <b>red</b> <b>flashing</b> <b>lights</b> {{on either side}} of the runway and a horizontal bar of <b>flashing</b> <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> to indicate the runway south of the railway line is closed, and may only land on the [...] section of the runway north of the railway line. [...] When the full length of the runway is open, a vertical bar of green lights signal to the aircraft, with regular rail signals {{on either side of}} the runway indicating trains to stop.|$|R
5000|$|Red Light Special: During the round, {{one item}} in the store is marked with a sign and a <b>flashing</b> <b>red</b> <b>light,</b> and the chefs must get that item and {{incorporate}} it into their dish. The item is typically not associated with the assigned dish, such as beef jerky for a dessert.|$|E
50|$|In Italy {{as well as}} some jurisdictions in the US, {{traffic lights}} {{inactive}} at nighttime emit a yellow-coloured flashing signal in directions owing priority while the intersecting street emit a <b>flashing</b> <b>red</b> <b>light,</b> requiring drivers to stop before proceeding. In Germany the priority directions will not be illuminated while the intersecting streets will be shown a flashing yellow signal.|$|E
50|$|The nearby harbour in Puerto de Mogán has {{two smaller}} aids to navigation, which mark the {{entrance}} to the port and marina. On the main breakwater is a light mounted on a tower above the centre of the El Faro restaurant. Painted white with red bands, the lantern on the 6m tower emits a <b>flashing</b> <b>red</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
50|$|The battery backups {{can operate}} the {{controller}} in emergency mode with the <b>red</b> <b>light</b> <b>flashing</b> or in fully functional mode. In 2004, California Energy Commission recommended to have {{local governments to}} convert their traffic lights to LEDs with battery backups. This would lower the energy consumption and enhance the safety at major intersections. The recommendation was for a system which provides fully functional traffic signals for two hours after the power outage. Then the signals will have <b>flashing</b> <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> for another two hours.|$|R
50|$|These {{responses}} require {{at least}} 1μmol/m2 to be initiated and become saturated at about 1000μmol/m2. Unlike VLFRs, these responses are photoreversible. This was shown by exposing lettuce seed to a brief <b>flash</b> of <b>red</b> <b>light</b> causing germination. It was then shown if this <b>red</b> <b>flash</b> {{was followed by}} a <b>flash</b> of far <b>red</b> <b>light,</b> germination was again inhibited. LFRs also follow the law of reciprocity. Other examples of LFRs include leaf de-etiolation and enhancement of rate of chlorophyll production.|$|R

5000|$|Action Chugger is Super-Hero Chugger. He {{responds}} to emergencies after being informed {{that he is}} needed by a <b>flashing</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> on his nose. He can unfold parts of his sides into short wings, each with a jet motor under it, and fly. After flying, he always lands on a railway track. Action Chugger's flight range extends {{at least as far}} as low Earth orbit. He normally resides in Chuggington.|$|E
5000|$|Failures: If {{power is}} still available, a {{flashing}} amber light {{is used to}} warn of an intersection. Methods to distinguish the main road from the secondary road (and hence right of way) include using yield (give way) signs, stop signs or a <b>flashing</b> <b>red</b> <b>light</b> on the secondary road as well as written signage. In some countries including Australia, the road rules outline procedures such as giving way to the right.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept of}} the video is a graphic novel and stays true to the famous lyric in the song, [...] "When the <b>red</b> <b>light</b> comes on, I transform," [...] as each group member {{transforms}} into an alter ego of theirs after a <b>flash</b> of <b>red</b> <b>light.</b> In the first verse and the first chorus, Aubrey O'Day portrays a con trying to claim her innocence during interrogation with a detective (played by Torriero). After a <b>flash</b> of <b>red</b> <b>light,</b> [...] "The Sweet Aubrey" [...] transforms. Now wearing a tight leather catsuit, she throws him on the table, straddles him, and handcuffs him to her chair. She leans in for a kiss before making her escape. D. Woods portrays a peep show performer enchanting her suitor. After a <b>flash</b> of <b>red</b> <b>light,</b> [...] "The Luscious D.Woods", now in all leather, grabs him and drags him into the peep show window. The impact knocks him out, leaving her {{to take all of}} his money.|$|R
5000|$|In {{nearly all}} cases, federal {{regulations}} require {{the removal of}} [...] "School Bus" [...] lettering and the disabling/removal of stop arms/warning lights. [...] In some states, the bus is required to change its color from School Bus Yellow entirely. In church use, transporting adults and/or children, traffic law no longer gives church buses traffic priority in most states (Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia being the only states where a church bus can stop traffic with <b>flashing</b> <b>red</b> <b>lights).</b>|$|R
25|$|A SPAD {{indicator}} is {{a separate}} indicator which may be positioned after a main signal {{where there is a}} likelihood of a serious collision at a junction if a SPAD (signal passed at danger) occurs at the main signal. SPAD indicators are mounted against a blue backplate or surround. They are normally unlit but following a SPAD they display a steady <b>red</b> <b>light</b> between two <b>flashing</b> <b>red</b> <b>lights</b> arranged vertically. Any driver who sees a SPAD indicator illuminated must stop their train immediately, even if they can see that the signal pertaining to their line is showing a proceed aspect.|$|R
