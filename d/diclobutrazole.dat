2500|$|Hydrazine is a {{precursor}} to several pharmaceuticals and pesticides. Often these applications involve conversion of hydrazine to heterocyclic rings such as pyrazoles and pyridazines. [...] Examples of commercialized bioactive hydrazine derivatives include cefazolin, rizatriptan, anastrozole, [...] fluconazole, metazachlor, metamitron, metribuzin, paclobutrazol, <b>diclobutrazole,</b> propiconazole,hydrazine sulfate, diimide and triadimefon.|$|E
40|$|A two phase {{hollow fiber}} liquid phase microextraction (HF-LPME) and gas {{chromatography}} mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method for the separation and determination of triazole fungicides, namely, penconazole, hexaconazole, <b>diclobutrazole</b> and diniconazole, is described. The extraction conditions were optimized {{for the four}} triazole fungicides as follows: extractant solvent, toluene; extraction time, 20 min; stirring rate, 720 rpm; no salt addition; and no pH adjustment. Under the optimal extraction conditions, the method showed good linearity (r 2 = 0. 997 – 0. 999), acceptable reproducibility (RSD% = 6 – 9 %), low limit of detection (0. 3 – 0. 8 μg·L– 1), and satisfactory relative recoveries. The linear range is 1 – 5000 μg·L– 1. The developed HF-LPME method was applied for the determination of triazole fungicides in farm, river, and tap water and also grape juice samples...|$|E
