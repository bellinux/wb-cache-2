This method employs a simple cheap Hall Effect sensor-based magnetic sensor unit to detect the mover position of the linear motor.

The amplitude of the sensor output voltage signals are adjusted to unit amplitude to minimize the amplitude errors. With the unit amplitude signals three to two phase transformation is done to reduce the three multiples of harmonic components. The final output thus obtained is converted to position data by the use of arctangent function. The measurement accuracy of the new method is analyzed by experiments and compared with the conventional two phase method.

A simple analysis replaces the electric field of the RF-v cavity system by a traveling wave, having the speed of a synchronous reference particle, and leads to a pair of differential equations of the form dy/dn = -K sin {pi}x, (1 A) where y measures the fractional departure of energy from the reference value {pi}x measures the <b>electrical</b> phase <b>angle</b> at which the particle traverses the cavity, and K is proportional to the cavity voltage; and dx/dn = {lambda}{prime}y, (1 b) in which {lambda}{prime} is proportional to the change of revolution period with respect to particle energy.

30|$|The {{concept of}} damping torque was first {{introduced}} to offer a physical insight to system stability problem on an SMIB system [25]. For an SMIB system, the damping torque coefficient can be estimated using the system response by using the least square method [26, 27] or Kalman filter [28]. To extend the concept to multi-machine power systems, the first attempt in [29] estimates the damping torque for each single generator using its own <b>electrical</b> torque, rotor <b>angle</b> and rotor speed trajectories based on the least square error. However, this intuitive extension {{is found to be}} valid only when the speed deviations for all other generators are zeros, while it is not tenable in general [30]. Another extension of this concept is mentioned in [31], where the damping torque coefficient for the same generator is supposed to be different with respect to different oscillation modes such that it should be calculated separately for each mode. Thus, the damping torque of a generator in a multi-machine system could be estimated using the system trajectories based on a certain modal analysis method, like total least square-estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance technique (TLS-ESPRIT) [31] or Prony [32].|$|R
