40|$|Abstract — One of most {{interesting}} aspects in haptic research {{deals with the}} extension of application workspace, thus allowing haptic simulation within large virtual environments. Several devices have been realized that allow this kind of interaction, in particular our interest focuses on mobile haptic interfaces, realized by combining classic grounded haptic devices with mobile platforms. While grounded haptic interfaces feature spatial limitations due to manipulator dimensions, mobile haptic interfaces are characterized by dynamical limitations due to performance of <b>employed</b> <b>devices.</b> In this paper we introduce an experimental analysis to evaluate performance of mobile haptic interface from a transparency standpoint. Moreover, some basic guidelines are presented to enhance MHI performance by setting the controller depending on technical parameters characterizing used devices. I...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} general method to {{quantify}} both bipartite and multipartite entanglement in a device-independent manner, meaning {{that we put}} a lower bound {{on the amount of}} entanglement present in a system based on observed data only but independently of any quantum description of the <b>employed</b> <b>devices.</b> Some of the bounds we obtain, such as for the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt Bell inequality or the Svetlichny inequality, are shown to be tight. Besides, device-independent entanglement quantification can serve as a basis for numerous tasks. We show in particular that our method provides a rigorous way to construct dimension witnesses, gives new insights into the question whether bound entangled states can violate a Bell inequality, and can be used to construct device independent entanglement witnesses involving an arbitrary number of parties.

Strong evidence is provided which suggest that the anomalous peak in ISUB versus VC, is due to electron-electron interactions. © IEE...|$|R
40|$|Device-independent quantum key {{distribution}} does not need a precise quantum mechanical model of <b>employed</b> <b>devices</b> to guarantee security. Despite of its beauty, {{it is still a}} very challenging experimental task. We compare a recent proposal by Gisin et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 070501 (2010) ] to close the detection loophole problem with that of a simpler quantum relay based on entanglement swapping with linear optics. Our full-mode analysis for both schemes confirms that, in contrast to recent beliefs, the second scheme can indeed provide a positive key rate which is even considerably higher than that of the first alternative. The resulting key rates and required detection efficiencies of approx. 95 % for both schemes, however, strongly depend on the underlying security proof. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figure...|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the ways in}} which ethnic minority and majority group members account, in an interview context, for the existence of discrimination in Dutch society.

In both groups, certain members were found to use discursive strategies questioning the omnipresence of discrimination and problematizing its causes, whereas others <b>employed</b> <b>devices</b> that made discrimination appear factual, with the Dutch as its main agents. The use of these strategies was examined in relation to subject positions that the participants took up throughout the interview. It is concluded that the discursive strategies used can be understood in relation to the way speakers position themselves within particular discourses. Hence, similar discursive strategies function in different ways in different contexts, and both mainstream and discourse analytical studies on discrimination should not start from a simple majority-minority dichotomy. ...|$|E
40|$|Distributed {{embedded}} applications increasingly {{operate in}} changing environments where the application security {{depends on the}} type and properties of the currently used communication services and <b>employed</b> <b>devices.</b> While vulnerabilities, threats, and available security function processing power are changing, the applications, however, should automatically adapt to the varying conditions {{in order to maintain}} the necessary security without endeavor of users. We report on the security management subproject of the SIRENA project where we apply a special combination of policy-based management with model-based management in order to support fully automated security management functions at runtime as well as tool-assisted security requirement definition and system design. Within an application model, the definition of the application’s high-level security policy is of special importance. It represents the abstract security requirements and forms the starting point for the automated derivation of suitable security subsystem configurations which enforce the policy under changing environment conditions.

Experiments conducted in a semi submerged indust rial structure show that the tested flat port performs worse than the dome, providing higher image residuals and lower precision and accuracy in object space. A significant different quality per colour channel is also observed and its influence on achievable processing results is discussed...|$|E

40|$|A {{sequential}} protocol of multidimensional fractionation was optimised {{to enable}} the comparative profiling of fractions of proteomes from cultured human cells. Differential detergent fractionation was employed {{as a first step}} to obtain fractions enriched for cytosolic, membrane/organelle, nuclear, and cytoskeletal proteins. Following buffer exchange using gel-permeation chromatography, cytosolic proteins were further fractionated by 2 -dimensional chromatography employing anion-exchange followed by reversed-phase steps. Chromatographic fractions were shown to be readily compatible with 1 - and 2 -dimensional gel electrophoresis or with direct analysis by mass spectrometry using linear-MALDI-TOF-MS. Precision of extraction was confirmed by reproducible SDS-PAGE profiles, MALDI-TOF-MS spectra, and quantitation of trypsinolytic peptides using LC-MS/MS (MRM) analyses. Solid phases were immobilised in disposable cartridges and mobile-phase flow was achieved using a combination of centrifugation and vacuum pumping. These approaches yielded parallel sample handling which was limited only by the capacities of the <b>employed</b> <b>devices</b> and which enabled both high-throughput and experimentally precise procedures, as demonstrated by the processing of experimental replicates. Protocols were employed at 10 [*]mg scale of extracted cell protein, but these approaches would be directly applicable to both smaller and larger quantities merely by adjusting the employed solid- and mobile-phase volumes. Additional potential applications of the fractionation protocol are briefly described...|$|E
