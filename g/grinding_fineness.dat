Finely ground and DON-contaminated feed caused a significantly more pronounced lymphoplasmacytic infiltration both of PN and pars glandularis, partly paralleled by lymph follicle formation and detritus filled foveolae and tubes suggesting a local immune response probably triggered by epithelial lesions.

40|$|The {{grinding}} operation {{in a ball}} mill is widely used in comminution. This process is extremely capital and energy intensive process {{and at the same}} time it is notoriously inefficient. Therefore, simulation can be used as a convenient tool in studying the behaviour and performance of grinding circuits by facilitating the evaluation of various scenarios and identification of optimum operating conditions.

Prior to this second campaign, a systematic review of all drainage holes was carried out (Breiner et al. 2011).
