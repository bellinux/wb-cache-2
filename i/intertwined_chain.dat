Theor. 43 375001 doi: 10. 1088 / 1751 - 8113 / 43 / 37 / 375001 International audienceWe shall first {{consider}} the classical neutral Moran model with two alleles whose fate is either to become extinct or to reach fixation. We will study an ergodic {{version of the}} Moran model obtained by conditioning it to never hit the boundaries, making use of a Doob transform. We shall call it the recurrent Moran model. We will show that the Siegmund dual of the recurrent Moran process exists and is a substochastic birth and death chain. Conditioning this process to exit in its natural absorbing state, we construct a process with a unique absorbing state which is intertwined to the original recurrent Moran process. The time needed for the intertwined process to first hit its absorbing state {{is related to the}} time to reach stationarity for the recurrent Moran process. Using spectral information on the <b>intertwined</b> <b>chain,</b> we extract limiting information on this first hitting time that shows that there is no abrupt relaxation to equilibrium for the recurrent Moran chain. This makes use of the relation between duality and intertwining and strong stationary times. Other related transition times of the recurrent Moran chain are also briefly investigated, namely: the first return time to the ground state and the expected time needed to move {{from one end to the}} other end of the state-space...|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} {{synthesis}} {{of a series of}} homologous oligoviologens in which different numbers of 4, 4 ′-bipyridinium (BIPY^(2 +) subunits are linked by p-xylylene bridges, as a prelude to investigating how their radical cationic forms self-assemble both in solution and in the solid state. The strong radical–radical interactions between the radical cationic forms of the BIPY^(2 +) units—namely, BIPY^(•+) —in these oligoviologens induce intra- or intermolecular folding of these homologues. UV/Vis/NIR spectroscopic studies and DFT quantum mechanics indicate that the folding of the shorter oligoviologens is dominated by intermolecular radical–radical interactions. In addition to intermolecular interactions, strong intramolecular radical–radical interactions, which give rise to an NIR absorption band at 900 nm, tend to {{play a crucial role in}} governing the folding of the longer oligoviologens. The solid-state superstructure of the oligoviologen with three BIPY^(2 +) units reveals that two <b>intertwining</b> <b>chains</b> fold together to form a dimer, stabilized by intermolecular radical–radical interactions.

It affects proteins with diverse sequences and structures, {{and is expected to}} play important roles in evolution, functional regulation and even conformational diseases. Here, we search for traces of domain swapping in the protein sequence, by means of algorithms that predict the structure and stability of proteins using database-derived potentials. Regions whose sequences are not optimal with regard to the stability of the native structure, or showing marked intrinsic preferences for non-native conformations in absence of tertiary interactions are detected in most domain-swapping proteins. These regions are often located in areas crucial in the swapping process and are likely to influence it on a kinetic or thermodynamic level. In addition, cation-pi interactions are frequently observed to zip up the edges of the interface between <b>intertwined</b> <b>chains</b> or to involve hinge loop residues, thereby modulating stability.

The complementary nature of the antiparallel DNA strands enables each to serve as a template for the synthesis of the respective daughter DNA strands. The intertwining of these polynucleotide chains in duplex DNA further ensures the integrity of the DNA helix by physically linking the individual strands in a structure stabilized by hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions between the hydrophobic bases (Bjornsti and Osheroff, 1999).

EVB produces and supplies energy and utilities to other production plants at the Botlek site. Due to the <b>intertwined</b> value <b>chain</b> and reuse of each other’s residual and waste products, the situation at the Botlek is complicated. This report describes the development of a decision support model that contributes to an improved economic efficiency of AkzoNobel’s EVB plant. The decision support model calculates the optimal production settings that minimize the variable costs and assure that at all times the critical operational conditions are met. By comparing the results of the optimization model with the base case model, it can be concluded that there is a savings potential of more than 6 % of the variable costs of the EVB plant. From the optimized production settings a pattern is distinguished. This pattern is translated into a set of operational rules that {{can be applied to the}} EVB plant to realize the savings potential.

Using this combination of techniques has allowed six interatomic correlations to be distinguished and fitted to obtain a set of bond lengths and coordination numbers that describe {{the structure of the}} glass. The glass consists of metaphosphate chains of phosphate tetrahedra and each phosphate unit has two non-bridging oxygen atoms available for coordination with Ca. The Ca-O correlation was fitted with two peaks at 2. 35 and 2. 86 angstrom, representing a broad distribution of bond lengths. The total Ca-O coordination is 6. 9 and is consistent with distorted polyhedral units such as capped octahedra or capped trigonal prisms. It is found that most non-bridging oxygen atoms are bonded to two calcium atoms. All of these observations are consistent with Hoppe's model for phosphate glasses.

We also discuss several variations on this standard scenario. These variations can give rise to arbitrarily many <b>chains,</b> <b>intertwined</b> in a complex fashion, and the reconnection of these chains can be highly non-trivial. Finally we study the effect of dissipation on the birth process. For sufficiently small dissipation one can still recognize the birth and reconnection processes, but with several new features.

Specifically, financial services and business activities dominate domestic trade whereas electrical and machinery industries dominate foreign trade. In order to further specify each national sector's role individually, (cross-) clustering coefficients and cross-betweenness are obtained for different pairs of subgraphs. The corresponding analysis reveals that specific industrial sectors tend to favor distinct directionality patterns and that the cross-clustering coefficient for geographically close country pairs is remarkably high, indicating that spatial factors are still of paramount importance for the organization of trade patterns in modern economy.

The particle welding was subsequently carried out under pressure at various temperatures above Tm for various durations. Tensile drawing experiments performed on sintered samples either at room temperature or above Tm were specifically aimed at discriminating the role of chain interdiffusion through the particle interfaces from that of cocrystallization in the mechanism of particle welding. It turned out that efficient welding occurred within a very short time. One of the novel results of the work is the much weaker influence of sintering time as compared with temperature, giving evidence that chain interdiffusion is not governed by a reptation process. The entropy-driven melting explosion over distances much larger than the chain length between entanglements is suggested to be the main mechanism of the fast chain re-entanglement and particle welding in the present case of a nascent powder consisting of nonequilibrium chain-disentangled crystals.

25|$|Most {{crystalline}} {{forms of}} silica {{are made of}} infinite arrangements of {SiO4} tetrahedra connected at their corners, with each oxygen atom linked to two silicon atoms. In the thermodynamically stable room-temperature form, α-quartz, these tetrahedra are linked in <b>intertwined</b> helical <b>chains</b> with two different Si–O distances (159.7 and 161.7pm) with a Si–O–Si angle of 144°. These helices can be either left- or right-handed, so that individual α-quartz crystals are optically active. At 537°C, this transforms quickly and reversibly into the similar β-quartz, with a change of the Si–O–Si angle to 155° but a retention of handedness. Further heating to 867°C results in another reversible phase transition to β-tridymite, in which some Si–O bonds are broken {{to allow for the}} arrangement of the {SiO4} tetrahedra into a more open and less dense hexagonal structure. This transition is slow and hence tridymite occurs as a metastable mineral even below this transition temperature; when cooled to about 120°C it quickly and reversibly transforms by slight displacements of individual silicon and oxygen atoms to α-tridymite, similarly to the transition from α-quartz to β-quartz. β-tridymite slowly transforms to cubic β-cristobalite at about 1470°C, which once again exists metastably below this transition temperature and transforms at 200–280°C to α-cristobalite via small atomic displacements. β-cristobalite melts at 1713°C; the freezing of silica from themelt is quite slow and vitrification, or the formation of a glass, is likely to occur instead. In vitreous silica, the {SiO4} tetrahedra remain corner-connected, but the symmetry and periodicity of the crystalline forms are lost. Because of the slow conversions between these three forms, it is possible upon rapid heating to melt β-quartz (1550°C) or β-tridymite (1703°C). Silica boils at approximately 2800°C. Other high-pressure forms of silica are known, such as coesite and stishovite: these are known in nature, formed under the shock pressure of a meteorite impact and then rapidly quenched to preserve the crystal structure. Similar melting and cooling of silica occurs following lightning strikes, forming glassy lechatelierite. W-silica is an unstable low-density form involving {SiO4} tetrahedra sharing opposite edges instead of corners, forming parallel chains similarly to silicon disulfide (SiS2) and silicon diselenide (SiSe2): it quickly returns to forming amorphous silica with heat or traces of water.|$|R

In their ‘standard’ form, kinesin motors are elongated heterotetrameric protein complexes composed of two identical heavy chains and two light chains; the central regions of the heavy <b>chains</b> <b>intertwine,</b> forming a coiled coil, with the globular ‘heads’ of the microtubule-interacting motor domains at one end. In order to understand how kinesin motors interact with and move along microtubules, we have combined electron cryomicroscopy and X-ray crystallographic data to build {{a model of the}} complex. Results: Using electron cryomicroscopy and image reconstruction, we have obtained three-dimensional maps of complexes of kinesin motor domain dimers and microtubules. Motor domain dimers interact one to one with tubulin dimers, with one head attached – lying along the microtubule protofilament – and the other unattached – pointing sideways and upwards towards the microtubule plus end. Using currently available crystallographic data, we have built an atomic resolution model of the motor domain dimer, which can be successfully ‘docked’ into the three-dimensional framework of the maps from electron cryomicroscopy. Conclusions: Docking the atomic resolution model into the map of the microtubule–kinesin complex with the coiled coil of kinesin pointing away from the microtubule surface shows that the attached and unattached heads have similar relative positions on the microtubule and in the crystal. Three regions of the attached head appear likely to interact with the microtubule...|$|R

TEM images of PANI/MWCNTs in Fig.  8 a, b showed uniform deposition of PANI on the surface of P-MWCNTs which manifested from the bi-layered structure; the external layer is PANI with diameter ≈ 55  nm and the internal is CNT with diameter 10 – 40  nm, as the internal cavity is well discernible. Coating of MWCNTs with PANI takes place only on the outer surface of the MWCNTs where the polymerization of aniline inside the tubes of the CNTs is hindered and restricted by van der Waals force between tubes [31]. TEM images of PANI/G composite (Fig.  8 c, d) show a black layer of G with enormous wavy shape wrinkled on its surface [48], these wrinkles interpreted physical adsorption of PANI nanoparticles on graphene sheet’s surface due to π–π interaction force that was explicated by Raman analysis. The various weight ratios of graphitic materials had no effect on the morphological characteristics of PANI/P-MWCNTs and PANI/G composites because P-MWCNTs or G ratio was very small relative to PANI.|$|R

We studied the parameters that govern the injectability of HPTC using Intron injectability assay and rheological testing. We characterized the factors that were important for determining its force of injection, elastic and viscous moduli, oscillatory stress in response to increasing strain, viscosity change under constant shearing, and the percentage loss in elastic modulus after disruptive shearing. The effect of water content, steric hindrance introduced by the CMC pre-polymerization, CMC chain length, and the percentage of TEGDMA all have important contribution to the injectability of HPTC. We showed that optimal HPTC has superior injectability over the major permanent fillers that are FDA approved, which solved the needle-clogging problem. HPTC also showed good biocompatibility with no signs of fibrotic capsules, durability in vivo for 6 months, good tissue integration, undetectable migration to other organs, and feasibility to be co-injected with cells. It has also been evaluated for its efficacy in the treatment of urinary incontinence in an animal model for 24 weeks, and has shown significant dose-dependent improvement in urethral function by having an increased abdominal leak point pressure (ALPP) compared to the incontinence model alone. Combining its superior injectability, customizable mechanical viscoelastic properties, biocompatibility and effectiveness of restoring the urethral function in a rat incontinence model for 6 months, HPTC is a good candidate as a semi-permanent/ permanent injectable material for soft tissue augmentation...|$|R
