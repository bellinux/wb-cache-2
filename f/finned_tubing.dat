40|$|Greenhouses in cold regions often exhibit {{conditions}} of high relative humidity (RH). Frequent high RH levels of over 80 % result in poor yields and undesirable crop quality, {{as well as}} poor working conditions for employees. The objective {{of this study was}} to seek an effective and economical method(s) to control RH in greenhouses of cold regions. Three methods were tested and evaluated: <b>finned</b> <b>tubing</b> condensation, air-to-air heat exchangers, and domestic mechanical refrigeration dehumidifiers. Temperature based ventilation and RH based ventilation were used for comparisons. <b>Finned</b> <b>tubing</b> condensation using chilled water was tested in an environmental chamber. The condensation rates were obtained and statistical models were developed for the selected finned copper tubing with aluminum fins under various room and water conditions. This method was proved highly energy intensive and costly, thus discarded in the field experiment. The field experiment was conducted in a Saskatchewan greenhouse. The air-to-air heat exchangers and domestic mechanical refrigeration dehumidifiers were tested against the control treatment which was the temperature based ventilation control, i. e. relying on infiltration in winter and ventilation using exhaust fans in the other seasons. The field experimental results proved that dehumidification was needed most of the year with high RH occurring from April to November. The heat exchangers and dehumidifiers controlled RH very well in winter, early morning and night in other seasons, and saved heating cost; however, in mild and warm weather from about 9 am to noon the RH was high before the exhaust fans operated at full capacity. When the ambient air was humid during the warm season, the heat exchangers were ineffective for RH control. The dehumidifiers controlled RH not as well as the heat exchangers mainly due to the low capacity. Both methods added extra heat to the greenhouse in the warm season, which was desirable in early morning and at night when ambient temperature was low and heating was still needed but undesirable during daytime when cooling was required in the greenhouses. Comparing energy efficiency, the moisture removal index (MRI) of the dehumidifiers was around - 0. 629 kW-h/L (produced 0. 629 kW-h energy per liter of water removed), the heat exchangersâ€™ MRI was 0. 916 to 1. 020 kW-h/L (consumed 0. 916 - 1. 020 kW-h energy to remove 1 L of water), while the RH-based ventilation required 1. 099 to 1. 373 kW-h/L, and the <b>finned</b> <b>tubing</b> condensation required more than 7. 2 kW-h/L. If natural gas was the heat source, the dehumidifier method was the most economical with annual average energy cost of $ 0. 018 /L, approximately 60 % and 50 % of those of the heat exchangers and exhaust fans, respectively. If thermal coal was used as the heat source, the heat exchanger was the most economical with an annual average energy cost of $ 0. 016 /L, as compared to $ 0. 019 /L and $ 0. 035 /L for the dehumidifiers and exhaust fans, respectively. The mechanical dehumidifier method is energy efficient and effective year-round, and its operating cost is low, thus is recommended for greenhouse dehumidification in cold regions. However, a complete economic analysis that includes the capital cost is needed to evaluate the economic feasibility of the various methods. The heat exchanger is also recommended which can supply CO 2 in winter but it is ineffective in humid weather. Proper sizing of the dehumidification requirement is the key to success...|$|E
40|$|The {{calculations}} done to size {{the control}} dewar subcooler were done {{to obtain a}} sufficient subcooler size based on some conservative assumptions. The final subcooler design proposed in the design report will work even better because (1) It has more tubing length, and (2) will have already subcooled liquid at the inlet due to the transfer line design. The subcooler design described in the 'Design Report of the 2 Tesla Superconducting Solenoid for the Fermilab D 0 Detector Upgrade' is the final design proposed. A short description of this design follows. The subcooler is constructed of 0. 50 -inch OD copper tubing with 1. 0 -inch diameter fins. It has ten and one half spirals at a 11. 375 -inch centerline diameter to provide 31 feet of tubing length. The liquid helium supply for the solenoid flows through the subcooler and then is expanded through a J-T valve. The subcooler spirals are immersed in the return two phase helium process stream. The return stream is directed over the <b>finned</b> <b>tubing</b> by an annulus created by a 10 -inch pipe inside a 12 -inch pipe. The transfer line from the refrigerator to the control dewar is constructed such that the liquid helium supply tube is in the refrigerator return stream, thereby subcooling the liquid {{up to the point}} where the u-tubes connect the transfer line to the control dewar. The subcooler within the control dewar will remove the heat picked up in the helium supply u-tube/bayonets. The attached subcooler/heat exchanger calculations were done neglecting any subcooling in the transfer line. All heat picked up in the transfer line from the refrigerator storage dewar to the control dewar is absorbed by the supply stream. The subcooler was sized such that the two phase supply fluid is subcooled at 1. 7 atm pressure and when expanded through a JT valve to 1. 45 atm pressure it is at a saturated liquid state. The calculations apply during steady state operation and at a flow rate of 16 g/s. The analysis of the heat exchanger was broken into two parts relating to the heat transfer mode taking place. The first part is considered the condensing part in which the helium supply stream is changed from two phase fluid to one phase liquid. The second part is the subcooling part where the liquid temperature is lowered, i. e [...] subcooled. A summary of the calculations and results appears on the next page. The raw calculations follow the summary...|$|E
5000|$|Construction of the {{fuselage}} consisted of chrome-molybdenum steel tubing, covered with Haskelite plywood. The cantilever wing was also plywood-covered and had three spruce spars boxed with plywood and had plywood ribs and maple corner blocks. The interior {{structure of the}} <b>fin</b> was steel <b>tubing</b> with plywood ribs with the stabilizer, rudder and elevators having spruce spars, maple corner blocks and plywood ribs. The faired rudder was equipped with a trim tab operated from the cockpit; elevators and ailerons also had trim tabs. A [...] fuel tank was carried forward of the cabin and just aft of the engine behind a metal firewall was a [...] oil tank.|$|R
40|$|The Hot Primary Heat Exchanger (HPX), a key {{component}} of the ThermoAcoustic Life Sciences Refrigerator, consists of a tube and <b>fin</b> design. The <b>tubing</b> is bent into a serpentine pattern and overlayed on a screen of copper fins. The serpentine pattern results in several flow reversals and complex internal flow geometries within the heat exchanger. The fins are not consistently of uniform length and generally have heat rejection at both ends. This design results in a forced-cooled, single stack cold plate configuration with unequal temperatures {{at each end of the}} fin. The analysis of this configuration requires a methodology based upon the existence of an adiabatic point somewhere along the fin between the prime surfaces. Once the location of this adiabatic point is known, the cold plate may be treated on the basis of two isolated surfaces having fins with adiabatic tips. U. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|R
50|$|Spot welding is a {{resistance}} welding method used to join {{two or more}} overlapping metal sheets, studs, projections, electrical wiring hangers, some heat exchanger <b>fins,</b> and some <b>tubing.</b> Usually power sources and welding equipment are sized to the specific thickness and material being welded together. The thickness {{is limited by the}} output of the welding power source and thus the equipment range due to the current required for each application. Care is taken to eliminate contaminants between the faying surfaces. Usually, two copper electrodes are simultaneously used to clamp the metal sheets together and to pass current through the sheets. When the current is passed through the electrodes to the sheets, heat is generated due to the higher electrical resistance where the surfaces contact each other. As the electrical resistance of the material causes a heat buildup in the work pieces between the copper electrodes, the rising temperature causes a rising resistance, and results in a molten pool contained most of the time between the electrodes. As the heat dissipates throughout the workpiece in less than a second (resistance welding time is generally programmed as a quantity of AC cycles or milliseconds) the molten or plastic state grows to meet the welding tips. When the current is stopped the copper tips cool the spot weld, causing the metal to solidify under pressure. The water cooled copper electrodes remove the surface heat quickly, accelerating the solidification of the metal, since copper is an excellent conductor. Resistance spot welding typically employs electrical power in the form of direct current, alternating current, medium frequency half-wave direct current, or high-frequency half wave direct current.|$|R
