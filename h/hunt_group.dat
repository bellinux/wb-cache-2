50|$|Before {{a manual}} {{exchange}} was converted to automatic, changes to allocated numbers to facilitate PBX <b>hunting</b> <b>groups</b> were required. In SXS automatic exchanges only some number <b>groups</b> have PBX <b>hunting</b> facility, and within those number groups the main and other numbers in a <b>hunting</b> <b>group</b> {{have to be}} in a certain order. If TUDor 2725 (say) was to be the listed (main) number subsequent numbers must be 2726, 2727, 2728 2729 & 2720; and the PBX <b>hunting</b> <b>group</b> on 2725 is limited to a maximum of 6 incoming lines (although the PBX could also have additional outgoing-only lines to the exchange). A PBX group with 10 PBX-hunting lines would commence with 2721 (say) to 2720, and PBX <b>hunting</b> <b>groups</b> requiring more than 10 incoming lines would be served by special 11-and-over PBX final selectors which could search over several (10-line) levels in succession.|$|R

50|$|In telephony, {{line hunting}} (or <b>hunt</b> <b>group)</b> is {{the method of}} distributing phone calls from a single {{telephone}} number {{to a group of}} several phone lines. Specifically, it refers to the process or algorithm used to select which line will receive the call.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hunt</b> <b>Group</b> - A {{directory}} containing one or many destination numbers which, on {{receiving an}} incoming call, is programmed to ring {{them in a}} particular order, simultaneously or simply in {{the order in which}} they have most recently answered before being sent to a final destination if still unanswered.|$|E
5000|$|In {{circular}} hunting, {{the calls}} are distributed [...] "round-robin". If a call is delivered to line 1, the next call goes to 2, {{the next to}} 3. The succession throughout each of the lines continues even {{if one of the}} previous lines becomes free. When the end of the <b>hunt</b> <b>group</b> is reached, the hunting starts over at the first line. Lines are skipped only if they are still busy on a previous call.|$|E

5000|$|... ==Multi-{{line hunting}}== Multiline hunting (sometimes MLH, line hunting or MHG, {{multiline}} hunting group) is {{a feature that}} allows multiple telephone lines going into a business {{to act as a}} single group, called a <b>hunt</b> <b>group.</b> This type of fallback is a somewhat more complex form of call forwarding. If the line called is busy, the call goes to the next available line. Only if no lines in the group are open does the calling party get a busy signal.|$|E
50|$|GMSA {{announced}} on 18 May 2017 {{that it will}} stop production and sales of Chevrolet products by end of 2017. Isuzu will buy back the 30% ownership of Isuzu Trucks South Africa and will purchase GMSA's manufacturing facility and {{take control of the}} Port Elizabeth headquarters, to ensure that the Isuzu brand remains in South Africa. Regarding the Opel brand, On 14 June 2017 it was announced that the Opel brand would remain after the William <b>Hunt</b> <b>Group</b> stepped in to become the official distributor starting from January 2018.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{only one}} {{telephone}} number is usually announced, major stations typically have line hunting, {{with the same}} number being directed to any available one of several lines within the <b>hunt</b> <b>group.</b> If there are no open lines, the calling party may receive a busy signal as with an ordinary telephone call, or sometimes the special information tones followed by a recorded announcement that [...] "all circuits are busy, please try your call again later". In this case, the line often first gives that caller a ringback tone as if the call were being completed, misleading callers to think they may have actually gotten through the swarm of other calls that sometimes flood these lines.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the school}} year of 1983-1984, Mark Jenks and Todd Krause, two {{students}} at Washington High School in Milwaukee, wrote a software program for talking {{among a group of}} people. [...] They used the PDP-11 at the Milwaukee Public Schools (MPS) central office. After searching around the PDP-11 files and directories, Mark found the PDP-11 program talk, and decided that they could do better. The system had approximately 40 300-2400 bit per second modems attached to it, with a single phone number and a <b>hunt</b> <b>group.</b> The talk program was named TALK and was written to handle many options that are seen in IRC today: tables, private messages, actions, moderators and inviting to tables.|$|E
50|$|According to Telcordia GR-283-CORE, the Simplified Message Desk Interface (SMDI) is {{an analog}} {{interface}} between the local stored program controlled switching system (SPCS) and a message storage and retrieval (MSR) system. Calls are {{distributed to the}} call answering points with normal call processing or using multiline <b>hunt</b> <b>group</b> (MLHG) features. One or more MLHGs {{may be associated with}} the same set of SMDI data links. An identification scheme is assigned in the SPCS to identify each MLHG uniquely and each line in the MLHG, for which call information (e.g., calling number) is provided over the SMDI data link. This identification information is provided to the MSR system, with the call information, to help the MSR system correlate the call information with a call terminating on a particular line.|$|E
5000|$|Centrex obviates {{the need}} for {{separate}} exchange lines delivered to a site for use with a 1A2 Key System or similar, or PBX. Instead, telephone extensions, called Centrex lines, are delivered directly from the local exchange to the user. Some customers, however, still like to use a key telephone system for a small office within the large corporate Centrex, in an arrangement called [...] "key behind Centrex". Unlike with a conventional PBX, {{it is a simple}} matter to have extensions at different locations while allowing them to function as if they were within the same building. Newer IP PBX systems also allow phones at any location with a WAN or Internet connection to act as a local extension. Facilities such as Direct Inward Dialing (DID), where individual extensions are offered a direct and unique telephone number for incoming calls, are standard features in a Centrex environment. Stations may also be part of a <b>hunt</b> <b>group,</b> allowing for automatic distribution of incoming calls to two or more extensions.|$|E
