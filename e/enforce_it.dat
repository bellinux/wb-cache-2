5|$|The Anahuac Disturbances {{coincided with}} a Mexican civil war. Texians aligned {{themselves}} with proponents of federalism advocating a stronger role for state governments, in opposition to a centralized government that set most policies at the national level. The federalists prevailed, and their favored general, Antonio López de Santa Anna, was elected president. In 1835, Santa Anna began consolidating power; in response federalists launched armed rebellion in several Mexican states. Travis, an ardent foe of centralism, led an attack on Anahuac in June 1835 and forced the Mexican garrison to surrender. Many Texas settlers thought Travis's action was imprudent, and {{he was forced to}} apologize. Although the Mexican government issued a warrant for his arrest, local authorities did not <b>enforce</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|While the rioting mainly {{involved}} the working class, middle and upper-class New Yorkers had split sentiments on {{the draft and}} use of federal power or martial law to <b>enforce</b> <b>it.</b> Many wealthy Democratic businessmen sought to have the draft declared unconstitutional. Tammany Democrats did not seek to have the draft declared unconstitutional but helped pay the commutation fees {{for those who were}} drafted. In December 1863, the Union League Club recruited over 2,000 black soldiers, outfitted and trained them, honoring and sending men off with a parade through the city to the Hudson River docks in March 1864. A crowd of 100,000 watched the procession, which was led by police and members of the Union League Club.|$|E
5|$|A {{new system}} of {{controlling}} {{the movement of the}} First Nations was introduced by the government after the rebellion. Known as the pass system, this required any individual leaving a reserve to possess a pass signed by a government agent, or to face arrest by the police. The police received advice that the new policy was illegal, as it contravened Treaty 7, which had given guarantees of free movement, but they continued to <b>enforce</b> <b>it</b> for several years. Eventually the force turned to the vagrancy laws as an alternative approach for removing First Nations from selected areas. Police used agents employed to collect intelligence from within First Nation and Métis communities, and, from 1887, they also employed members of the First Nations as special constables, typically deploying them as scouts and trackers. These scouts wore an informal uniform and were empowered to arrest other members of their communities, but not whites.|$|E

5|$|The twin {{impacts of}} hurricanes Ingrid and Manuel {{prompted}} officials in Mexico {{to declare a}} state of emergency in 155municipalities in Veracruz, Tamaulipas, Chiapas, Oaxaca, Guerrero, and Chihuahua. The nation's Health Ministry sent medical crews across the country to affected areas in an effort {{to prevent the spread of}} disease; the agency also suggested residents boil their water. Officials opened shelters in Tamaulipas for residents whose houses were damaged, housing about 2,000people in the weeks following the storm. The Mexican food bank sent about 800tons of food to the hardest-hit parts of the country in Guerrero, Veracruz, and Sinaloa. In addition, the Mexican Red Cross delivered 186tons of food to Veracruz alone. Volunteers delivered about 600blankets and various cleaning supplies to the town of Pánuco. Following the storms, the National Civil Protection Coordination received the authority to prevent housing construction in areas at risk for mudslides and flooding; the law had passed in 2012, but initially lacked the authority to <b>enforce</b> <b>it.</b> Some residents in Tamaulipas complained at the slow pace of receiving aid. In response, the Gulf Cartel brought relief items to Aldama, with one columnist for El Universal suggesting that this was to gain favor with local residents.|$|E
5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Depression in the 1930s, the {{governors}} again began to reassert authority. The Executive Reorganization Act was passed, returning the governor to a considerable level of appointment power. New state welfare and regulatory agencies were placed directly under the governor's control, greatly expanding his role in running the state and creating a large number of patronage positions. The legislature responded by trying to create a merit system for public offices, but it was largely unable to effectively <b>enforce</b> <b>it</b> given the new scope of government agencies. The battle with the governor continued until 1941, when the legislature rescinded the Executive Reorganization Act and replaced it with the State Administration Act, which placed most of the government under the control of elected commissioners and reduced the governor's practical executive authority to commander of the militia and the executor of legislation. The matter was taken to the Indiana Supreme Court in the case of Tucker v. State. The court ruled {{for the first time that}} the governor was in fact the Chief Executive of the state, and that the legislature could pass no law that infringed upon that right. The decision was a major shift from previous court decisions and granted governors a legal basis to resist future encroachment on their powers.|$|E

25|$|The {{constitution}} and laws prohibit discrimination against people with {{physical or mental}} disabilities in employment, education, access to health care, or the provision of other state services, but {{the government does not}} effectively enforce these laws.

25|$|Britain {{announced}} that it would accept the partition plan, but refused to <b>enforce</b> <b>it,</b> arguing it was not accepted by the Arabs. Britain also refused to share the administration of Palestine with the UN Palestine Commission during the transitional period.

The FIA decided that the rule was too vague, and there was nothing they could do to <b>enforce</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|There is some {{disagreement}} as to {{the status}} of judgements handed down by courts during the Japanese Occupation. The view has been taken by some post-Occupation courts that decisions by Japanese tribunals applying the law were valid. Others have held that since the Japanese administration did not set up tribunals in compliance with the requirements of Straits Settlements law, while the law continued to apply there were no proper courts in existence to <b>enforce</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|Leaving Galveston in January, Wharton reached Commodore Moore's {{squadron}} off the Yucatan port of Sisal on April 18, 1842. The Wharton brought word to Commodore Moore {{that the}} Republic of Texas had declared a blockade of the Mexican coast and Wharton remained in Mexican waters to help <b>enforce</b> <b>it</b> until May 1842. Returning to Galveston, the Wharton saw almost her crew quit the {{service as a}} result of expiring enlistments and desertions.|$|E

25|$|It {{will not}} always be {{possible}} to sue under s 2(1), however. If there is no contract, for instance if an agreement was void ab initio on the ground of non est factum, {{then it will be}} necessary to sue under Hedley Byrne. Also, the misrepresentation must precede the contract, and is not actionable under s 2(1) even if it is found in the contract subsequently. Lastly, it has been suggested by McKendrick that if s 2(1)'s application leads to draconian consequences, a court may not be willing to <b>enforce</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the direct}} {{aftermath}} of the war, martial law was enstated in the West Bank, especially East Jerusalem, and the military police {{was called in to}} <b>enforce</b> <b>it.</b> The corps worked under the newly appointed military governor, then-Brigadier General Shlomo Lahat. The first MP base in East Jerusalem was located in the Saint George Hotel, and dealt with the prevention of looting, arrest of Arab militants, and blocking Israeli citizens from entering the newly acquired territories. Martial law was also enforced by MPs based at Gadot on the Syrian Druze villages of the Golan Heights, after their capture.|$|E
25|$|Nevada voters {{enacted a}} smoking ban ("The Nevada Clean Indoor Air Act") in November 2006 that became {{effective}} on December 8, 2006. It outlaws smoking in most workplaces and public places. Smoking is permitted in bars, {{but only if}} the bar serves no food, or the bar is inside a larger casino. Smoking is also permitted in casinos, certain hotel rooms, tobacco shops, and brothels. However, some businesses do not obey this law and the government tends not to <b>enforce</b> <b>it.</b> In 2011, smoking restrictions in Nevada were loosened for certain places which allow only people age 21 or older inside.|$|E

25|$|On 22 May 1864 Tsar Alexander II {{approved}} this program. A {{few days}} later Muravyov issued an administrative order that forbade printing Lithuanian language textbooks written in the Latin alphabet. This order was developed into a comprehensive ban on September 6, 1865 by Konstantin Petrovich von Kaufman, Muravyov's successor. Kaufman issued an order to six neighboring governorates declaring a full ban on all publications and demanding that censorship committees <b>enforce</b> <b>it</b> without hesitation. A week later the order was extended to the entire Empire by Pyotr Valuev, Minister of the Interior. In 1866 the ban was further extended to include all academic books.|$|E
25|$|Section 92A of the Constitution Act, 1867 {{assigned}} to the provincial governments the exclusive authority to make laws in relation to non-renewable resources and electrical energy, while Section 125 prevented the federal government from taxing any provincial government lands or property. On the other hand, {{the federal government has}} the power to make treaties with foreign countries. This has important implications for treaties involving energy production, like the Kyoto Protocol, which the Canadian government signed in 2002. Although the federal government had the authority to sign the treaty, it may require the cooperation of the provincial governments to <b>enforce</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|The fifty-nine {{community}} {{districts in}} New York City, each represented by an appointed advisory group called a community board. Each board consists of fifty unpaid members {{appointed by the}} borough president. Half of the members are nominated by the City Council members who represent the area. The power of the community boards is very limited. They serve in an advisory capacity regarding land use and zoning, budget and various concerns of the community. The boards can recommend action {{on the part of}} the city government, but they cannot <b>enforce</b> <b>it.</b> Each is identified by borough name and a number (e.g. Manhattan Community Board 3).|$|E
50|$|In {{practice}} {{the idea of}} a state contingent security for every possible realization of nature seems unrealistic.
