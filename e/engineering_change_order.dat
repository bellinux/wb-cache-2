5000|$|The {{fundamental}} {{durability and}} reliability of DECtape was underscored when {{the design of the}} tape reel mounting hubs was changed in the early 1970s. The original machined metal hub with a retaining spring was replaced by a lower cost single-piece plastic hub with 6 flexible arms in a [...] "starfish" [...] or [...] "flower" [...] shape. When a defective batch of these new design hubs was shipped on new DECtape drives, these hubs would loosen over time. As a result, DECtape reels would fall off the drives, usually when being spun at full speed, as in an end-to-end seek. The reel of tape would fall onto the floor and roll in a straight line or circle, often unspooling and tangling the tape as it went. In spite of this horrifying spectacle, desperate users would carefully untangle that tape and wind it laboriously back onto the tape reel, then re-install it onto the hub, with a paper shim to hold the reel more tightly. The data on the mangled DECtape could often be recovered completely and copied to another tape, provided that the original tape had only been creased multiple times, and not stretched or broken. DEC quickly issued an <b>Engineering</b> <b>Change</b> <b>Order</b> (ECO) to replace the defective hubs, to resolve the problem.|$|E

Such a long lead time is especially remarkable as the actual processing time for the change typically does not exceed 2 weeks. Based on our case study, we develop an analytical framework that explains how such an extreme ratio between theoretical processing time and actual lead time is possible. The framework identifies congestion, stemming from scarce capacity coupled with processing variability, as a major lead time contributor.

40|$|Abstract — Crosstalk {{noise in}} the clock network of digital {{circuits}} is often detected late in the design cycle, sometimes as late as after first silicon. It is therefore necessary to fix crosstalk violations in the clock tree by making minimal design changes and maintaining skew bounds. We propose a novel approach for making <b>Engineering</b> <b>Change</b> <b>Order</b> (ECO) changes in the clock network to remove crosstalk violations. A two-pronged approach based on wire-translocation and rerouting is presented. Wire translocation, i. e., changing the track for a net to another free track with less crosstalk, eliminates {{a large percentage of}} removable violations. A linear time procedure to check if a violation is removable by translocation is developed. Next, an efficient rerouting method based on an incremental loci-finding algorithm is combined with linear time dynamic programming approach to eliminate the remaining crosstalk violations.

40|$|Abstract — The growing size, {{density and}} {{complexity}} of modern VLSI chips are contributing {{to an increase in}} hardware faults and design errors in the silicon, decreasing manufacturing yield and increasing the design cycle. The use of Partially Programmable Circuits (PPCs) has been recently proposed for yield enhancement with very small overhead. This new circuit structure is obtained from conventional logic by replacing some subcircuits with programmable LUTs. The present paper lays the theoretical groundwork for evaluating PPCs with Quantified Boolean Formula (QBF) satisfiability. First, QBF models are constructed to calculate the fault tolerance and design error tolerance of a PPC, namely the percentages of faults and design errors that can be masked using LUT reconfigurations. Next, zero-cost <b>Engineering</b> <b>Change</b> <b>Order</b> (ECO) in PPCs is investigated.

40|$|Abstract: Incremental {{physical}} CAD is encountered {{frequently in}} the socalled <b>engineering</b> <b>change</b> <b>order</b> (ECO) process in which design changes are made typically late in the design process in order to correct logical and/or technological problems in the circuit.

In this dissertation, we study several deep submicron problems (eg. cou-pling capacitance, antenna effect and delay variation) and propose optimization techniques to mitigate these DSM effects in the place-and-route stage of VLSI physical design. The place-and-route stage of physical design can be further divided into several steps: (1) Placement, (2) Global routing, (3) Layer assignment, (4) Track assignment, and (5) De-tailed routing. Among them, layer/track assignment assigns major trunks of wire segments to specific layers/tracks in order to guide the underlying detailed router. In this dissertation, we have proposed techniques to handle coupling capacitance at the layer/track assignment stage, antenna effect at the layer assignment, and delay variation at the ECO (<b>Engineering</b> <b>Change</b> <b>Order)</b> placement stage, respectively.

This work depicts a new ECO routing design flow with routing graph reduction and enhanced global routing flow. Routing graph reduction reduces the complexity of nodes by removing redundant tiles and aligning neighboring tiles to merge adjacent block tiles. Routing graph reduction reduces tile fragmentation such that the ECO router can run twice as fast without sacrificing routing quality. Enhanced global routing flow incorporates ECO global routing with extended routing and GCell restructuring to prevent routing failure in a routable routing.

40|$|Abstract — In a {{realistic}} design flow, circuit and system optimizations must interact with physical {{aspects of the}} design. For example, improvements in timing and power may require replacing large modules with variants that have different power/delay trade-off, shape and connectivity. New logic may be added late in the design flow, subject to interconnect optimization. To support such flexibility in design flows we develop a robust system for performing <b>Engineering</b> <b>Change</b> <b>Orders</b> (ECOs). In contrast with existing stand-alone tools that offer poor interfaces to the design flow and cannot handle {{a full range of}} modern VLSI layouts, our ECO-system reliably handles fixed objects and movable macros in instances with widely varying amounts of whitespace.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a robust quadratic placement approach, which offers both high-quality placements and excellent computational efficiency. The additional force which distributes the modules on the chip in force-directed quadratic placement is separated into two forces: hold force and move force. Both of these forces are determined without any heuristics. Based on this novel systematic force implementation, {{we show that}} our iterative placement algorithm converges to an overlapfree placement. In addition, <b>engineering</b> <b>change</b> <b>order</b> (ECO) is efficiently supported by our placer. To handle the important trade-off between CPU time and placement quality, a deterministic quality control is presented. In addition, a new linear net model is proposed, which accurately models the half-perimeter wirelength (HPWL) in the quadratic cost function of quadratic placement. HPWL in general is a linear metric for netlength and re{{presents a}}n efficient and common estimation for routed wirelength. Compared with the classical clique net model, our linear net model reduces memory usage by 75 %, CPUtimeby 23 % and netlength by 8 %, whichis measured by the HPWL of all nets. Using the ISPD- 2005 benchmark suite for comparison, our placer combined with the new linear net model has just 5. 9 % higher netlength but is 16 × faster than APlace, which offers the best netlength in this benchmark. Compared to Capo, our placer has 9. 2 % lower netlength and is 5. 4 × faster.

The stability of a partitioning algorithm is an important criterion for a partitioning based placement to achieve timing closure through the repetition of the placement procedure [2].
