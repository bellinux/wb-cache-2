5|$|S.iniae has {{occasionally}} produced {{infection in}} humans, especially fish handlers of Asian descent. Human infections include sepsis, toxic shock syndrome, and <b>inflammation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin,</b> intervertebral discs, or inner {{layer of the}} heart. Identifying S.iniae in the laboratory can be difficult, since the conventional methods used to identify streptococci yield insufficient results. It cannot be grouped by the Lancefield antigen method typically used to categorize Streptococcus species. The two known serotypes can be distinguished biochemically by differences in enzyme activity. Several antibiotics {{have been used to}} treat S.iniae infections.|$|E

25|$|Patch {{testing is}} a method used to {{determine}} if a specific substance causes allergic <b>inflammation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b> It tests for delayed reactions. It is used to help ascertain the cause of skin contact allergy, or contact dermatitis. Adhesive patches, usually treated with a number of common allergic chemicals or skin sensitizers, are applied to the back. The skin is then examined for possible local reactions at least twice, usually at 48 hours after application of the patch, and again two or three days later.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms can be {{directly}} or indirectly related {{to the loss of}} bowel control. The direct (primary) symptom is a lack of control over bowel contents which tends to worsen without treatment. Indirect (secondary) symptoms, which are the result of leakage, include pruritus ani (an intense itching sensation from the anus), perianal dermatitis (irritation and <b>inflammation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> around the anus), and urinary tract infections. Due to embarrassment, people may only mention secondary symptoms rather than acknowledge incontinence. Any major underlying cause will produce additional signs and symptoms, such as protrusion of mucosa in external rectal prolapse. Symptoms of fecal leakage (FL) are similar, and may occur after defecation. There may be loss of small amounts of brown fluid and staining of the underwear.|$|E
25|$|The venom of an Africanized bee is {{the same}} as that of a European honey bee, but since the former tends to sting in far greater numbers, the number of deaths from them are {{naturally}} greater than from European honey bees. While allergies to the European honey bee may cause death, death and complications from African bee stings are usually not caused from allergies to their venom. Humans stung many times by the African honey bees can exhibit serious side effects such as <b>inflammation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin,</b> dizziness, headaches, weakness, edema, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. Some cases even progress to affect different body systems by causing increased heart rates, respiratory distress, and even renal failure. African bee sting cases can become very serious, but they remain relatively rare and are often limited to accidental discovery in populated areas.|$|E
40|$|Background and Objective: Pimples (acne) {{are small}} <b>skin</b> lesions or <b>inflammations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b> <b>The</b> most common factor causing acne is the {{hormonal}} {{changes that occur}} during adolescent and teenage years. Antibiotics are becoming less effective in <b>the</b> treatment <b>of</b> pimples due to increasing concerns of antibiotic resistance. This study was therefore carried out to characterize the isolates from <b>the</b> pimples <b>of</b> Covenant University Students and to determine their antibiotics sensitivity pattern. Materials and Methods: A total of 20 swab samples were obtained from {{male and female students}} with obvious signs of pimples in Covenant University, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria. The samples obtained were cultured on Mannitol Salt Agar and incubated at 37 EC. Pure isolates obtained were subjected to Gram staining and other biochemical tests for identification. The isolates were further subjected to antibiotics sensitivity tests using antibiotic dics. Results: Macroscopic examination indicated that the organisms were convex, smooth and shiny. Microscopic examination revealed that the isolates were positive after employing the Gram Staining technique and they appeared as grape-like clusters. Biochemical tests revealed that the isolates were Coagulase positive, Catalase positive, Urease positive, Citrate positive, Methyl-Red positive, Voges-Proskauer negative and negative upon starch hydrolysis. The sugar fermentation tests revealed that the isolates fermented Glucose, Maltose, Galactose, Sucrose and Lactose, respectively. The antibiotic susceptibility test showed that isolates were resistant to Cotrimazole, Cloxacillin, Erythromycin, Gentamycin, Augmentin, Streptomycin, Tetracycline and Chloramphenicol. Conclusion: The results therefore indicated that the isolates were Staphylococcus aureus and other staphylococci species. Indiscriminate use of antibiotics should be avoided to prevent <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> resistant strains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Staphylococci genera and other pathogenic organisms...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIntroductionPercutaneous {{implants}} such as {{bone conduction}} hearing implants suffer from complications that include <b>inflammation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surrounding <b>skin.</b> A sealed skin-abutment interface can prevent <b>the</b> ingress <b>of</b> bacteria, which should reduce <b>the</b> occurrence <b>of</b> peri-abutment dermatitis. It {{was hypothesized that}} a hydroxyapatite (HA) coated abutment in conjunction with soft tissue preservation surgery should enable integration with <b>the</b> adjacent <b>skin.</b> Previous research has confirmed that integration is never achieved with as-machined titanium abutments. Here, we investigate, in vivo, if skin integration is achievable in patients using a HA-coated abutment. Materials and MethodsOne titanium abutment (control) and one HA-coated abutment (case) together with <b>the</b> surrounding <b>skin</b> were surgically retrieved from two patients who had a medical indication for this procedure. Histological sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> were investigated using light microscopy. The abutment was qualitatively analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results The titanium abutment only had a partial and thin layer of attached amorphous biological material. The HA-coated abutment was almost fully covered by a pronounced thick layer of skin components that were organized and composed of different interconnected structural layers. ConclusionProof-of-principle evidence that the HA-coated abutment can achieve integration with <b>the</b> surrounding <b>skin</b> was presented for the first time...|$|R

5|$|Psoriasis vulgaris (also {{known as}} chronic {{stationary}} psoriasis or plaque-like psoriasis) {{is the most}} common form and affects 85%–90% of people with psoriasis. Plaque psoriasis typically appears as raised areas of inflamed skin covered with silvery-white scaly skin. These areas are called plaques and are most commonly found on the elbows, knees, scalp, and back. Psoriatic erythroderma (erythrodermic psoriasis) involves widespread <b>inflammation</b> and exfoliation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> over most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body surface. It may be accompanied by severe itching, swelling, and pain. It is often <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> an exacerbation of unstable plaque psoriasis, particularly following <b>the</b> abrupt withdrawal <b>of</b> systemic glucocorticoids. This form of psoriasis can be fatal as the extreme inflammation and exfoliation disrupt the body's ability to regulate temperature and perform barrier functions.|$|R
40|$|Contact {{dermatitis}} is <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> inflammatory responses {{mediated by}} hapten-specific activated CD 8 + and CD 4 + T cells. Activation-induced cell death (AICD) is a naturally occurring process regulating <b>the</b> resolution <b>of</b> T-cell responses through decreased expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antiapoptotic molecule cellular FLICE inhibitory protein (cFLIP). We show that targeting cFLIP expression in vitro and in vivo, with morpholino antisense applied systemically or topically {{in conjunction with}} antigen, sensitizes T cells to undergo “early” AICD resulting in tolerance. Analysis of antisense-treated CD 8 + OT- 1 splenocytes after co-culture with SIINFEKL-pulsed DCs showed apoptosis occurring in a dose-dependent manner with respect to cFLIP peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PPMO) concentration. A transplant acceptance model using male DO. 11 donor cells and female BALB/c recipient mice showed that cFLIP antisense treatment could promote antigen tolerance. Hypersensitivity responses induced in mice by <b>the</b> epicutaneous application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> haptens FITC and oxazolone confirmed that topically applied cFLIP antisense could reduce <b>inflammation.</b> Treatment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> produced significant reduction in dermatitis and localized infiltration <b>of</b> lymphocytes. Moreover, <b>the</b> treatment was target- and antigen-specific, dose-dependent, and capable of inducing long-lived tolerance.
