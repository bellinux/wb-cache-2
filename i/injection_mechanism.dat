50|$|Electrons {{are moved}} onto the charge {{trapping}} layer similarly {{to the way}} that floating gate NOR flash is programmed, through channel hot electron (CHE) <b>injection</b> <b>mechanism</b> also known as Hot-carrier injection. In brief, a high voltage is placed between the control gate while a medium-high voltage is applied on the source and the drain while a current is induced from the source to the drain. Those electrons that have gained sufficient energy in traversing through the high-field region near the drain will boil off from the channel to be injected into the charge trapping layer where they come to rest.|$|E

40|$|A kriging {{modeling}} method is proposed {{to conduct the}} temperature uncertainty analysis of an <b>injection</b> <b>mechanism</b> in squeeze casting. A mathematical model of temperature prediction with multi input and single output is employed to estimate the temperature spatiotemporal distributions of the <b>injection</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The kriging model applies different weights to the independent variables according to spatial location of sample points and their correlation, thus reducing the estimation variance. The predicted value of the kriging model is compared with the sample data at the corresponding position to investigate {{the influence of the}} temperature uncertainty of the <b>injection</b> <b>mechanism</b> on the injection process including friction. The results indicate that the significant error is observed at a few sample points in the early injection due to the impact of the uncertainty facts. The variance mean and standard deviation obtained by the model calibrated by experimental samples reduce largely in comparison to those obtained from the initial kriging model. This study indicates that model calibration produces more accurate prediction...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePower supply underpowering and {{negative}} power supply glitches {{are commonly used}} {{for the purpose of}} injecting faults into secure circuits. The related fault <b>injection</b> <b>mechanism</b> has been extensively studied: it is based on setup time violations. Positive power supply glitches are also used to inject faults. However, an increase of the supply voltage is not consistent with a mechanism based on setup time violation. Besides, no research work has yet identified the corresponding mechanism. In this work, we report the use of an embedded delay-meter to monitor the core voltage of a programmable device exposed to power supply glitches.

40|$|Abstract- Although {{autonomic}} computing reduces traditional operational cost, it introduces another cost factor related to operation knowledge. This paper focuses on self-healing func-tionality and proposes a technique which improves reusability of component-level operation knowledge for self-healing sys-tems. Operation knowledge which attains reusability becomes independent {{of a specific}} system structure, and therefore it can be reused across organizations and adapted to changes. To achieve reusability, operation knowledge is encapsulated in components whereas system specific information is excluded. To cope with the remaining problem of dependency among components, a dependency <b>injection</b> <b>mechanism</b> is introduced. The dependency <b>injection</b> <b>mechanism</b> works out needed recovery actions by relating component and system-specific information. Furthermore, this paper describes an implemented prototype together with an application example. I...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} floating-gate {{synaptic}} circuit that updates its weight {{according to the}} Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) rule. The weight (or floating-gate voltage) is updated only if the time difference between the pre- and post-synaptic spikes falls within a learning window. The update is implemented through tunneling and <b>injection</b> <b>mechanisms</b> which can be tuned for very long time constants up to seconds. The novelty of this circuit is that the tunneling and <b>injection</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are turned on only when the correlation of the pre and postsynaptic activity is significant. The additional benefit of this non-volatile technology is that synaptic weights can be stored locally on chip. We present experimental results that show the learning and normalization effects from the fabricated circuits...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{complexity}} of analog VLSI systems is often {{limited by the}} number of pins on a chip rather than by the die area. Currently, many analog parameters and biases are stored off-chip. Moving parameter storage on-chip could save pins and allow us to create complex programmable analog systems. In this paper, we present a design for an on-chip nonvolatile analog memory cell that can be configured in addressable arrays and programmed easily. We use floating-gate MOS transistors to store charge, and we use the processes of tunneling and hot-electron injection to program values. We have fabricated two versions of this design: one with an nFET <b>injection</b> <b>mechanism</b> and one with a pFET <b>injection</b> <b>mechanism.</b> With these designs, we achieve greater than 13 -bit output precision with a 39 -dB power-suppl...|$|E

To solve this problem, we have developed a new gas injection inverter scroll compressor for marine container refrigeration unit. The new compressor is based on a conventional scroll compressor, which has been used in various industrial air conditioners for a long time, with some greatly improved technologies. For instance, the efficiency of the compressor is increased by optimizing the gas <b>injection</b> <b>mechanism.</b> On top of this, the efficiency at low speed operation is increased by using interior permanent magnet synchronous motor. As a result, it was possible to achieve higher refrigeration capacity without increasing the size of the new compressor. The energy consumption has decreased by 45 % compared to conventional models.

The influence of device dimensions on the gate injection efficiency and hot carrier degradation is also studied. Results show that the degradation under negative substrate voltage operation is strongly dependent on the transverse electric field and spread of the interface trap profile. The possible mechanism responsible for such trends is discussed. It is also found that, under identical gate current (programming time in flash memory cells), the degradation is less for higher negative substrate bias, which is helpful in realizing fast and reliable flash memories...|$|E
