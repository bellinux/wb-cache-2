5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that gender differences in attachment patterns of adaptive significance begin to emerge in middle childhood. <b>Insecure</b> attachment and early psychosocial stress indicate the presence of environmental risk (for example poverty, mental illness, instability, minority status, violence). Environmental risk can cause <b>insecure</b> attachment, while also favouring the development of strategies for earlier reproduction. Different reproductive strategies have different adaptive values for males and females: <b>Insecure</b> males tend to adopt avoidant strategies, whereas <b>insecure</b> females tend to adopt anxious/ambivalent strategies, unless they are in a very high risk environment. Adrenarche is proposed as the endocrine mechanism underlying the reorganization of <b>insecure</b> attachment in middle childhood.|$|E
5|$|There is an {{extensive}} {{body of research}} demonstrating a significant association between attachment organizations and children's functioning across multiple domains. Early <b>insecure</b> attachment does not necessarily predict difficulties, {{but it is a}} liability for the child, particularly if similar parental behaviours continue throughout childhood. Compared to that of securely attached children, the adjustment of <b>insecure</b> children in many spheres of life is not as soundly based, putting their future relationships in jeopardy. Although the link is not fully established by research and there are other influences besides attachment, secure infants are more likely to become socially competent than their <b>insecure</b> peers. Relationships formed with peers influence the acquisition of social skills, intellectual development and the formation of social identity. Classification of children's peer status (popular, neglected or rejected) has been found to predict subsequent adjustment. <b>Insecure</b> children, particularly avoidant children, are especially vulnerable to family risk. Their social and behavioural problems increase or decline with deterioration or improvement in parenting. However, an early secure attachment appears to have a lasting protective function. As with attachment to parental figures, subsequent experiences may alter the course of development.|$|E
5|$|Cambodia has no proven {{fossil fuel}} reserves, and is almost {{completely}} dependent on imported diesel fuel for electricity production. Consequently, Cambodians face an <b>insecure</b> supply and pay {{some of the}} highest energy prices in the world. The impacts of this are widespread and may hinder economic development.|$|E
5|$|In a 2013 {{analysis}} of over 170,000 website defacements, published by Zone-H, {{the most frequently}} (53%) used technique was exploitation of file inclusion vulnerability, mostly related to <b>insecure</b> usage of the PHP functions include, require, and allow_url_fopen.|$|E
5|$|Leighton Meester, who {{portrayed the}} {{character}} in the television drama, has described Blair as being <b>insecure</b> about her social status. At times, this anxiety creates flaws and complexities which contribute to character development. In Meester's view, the true Blair is ultimately a good girl at heart.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people can}} only judge of things by the {{experiences}} of ordinary life, but phenomena {{outside the scope of}} this are really quite numerous. How <b>insecure</b> it is to investigate natural principles using only the light of common knowledge, and subjective ideas.|$|E
5|$|On 30 November 1204, King Emeric died, and Ladislaus succeeded him. Pope Innocent III sent {{a letter}} to Duke Andrew, warning him to respect the child king's interests. However, refusing to heed Innocent's warning, Andrew seized the money that Emeric had {{deposited}} in the Pilis Abbey for Ladislaus. Considering her son's position to be <b>insecure,</b> Constance fled to Austria, taking Ladislaus with her.|$|E
5|$|Studies have {{suggested}} that infants with a high-risk for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) may express attachment security differently from infants with a low-risk for ASD. Behavioral problems and social competence in <b>insecure</b> children increase or decline with deterioration or improvement in quality of parenting {{and the degree of}} risk in the family environment.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} and empirically {{supported}} method for assessing attachment in infants (11 months–17 months) is the Strange Situation Protocol, developed by Mary Ainsworth {{as a result of}} her careful in-depth observations of infants with their mothers in Baltimore, USA (see below). The Strange Situation Protocol is a research tool that was not intended for diagnostic purposes. While the procedure may be used to supplement clinical impressions, the resulting classifications should not be confused with the psychiatric diagnosis 'Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD)'. The clinical concept of RAD differs in a number of fundamental ways from the theory and research driven attachment classifications based on the Strange Situation Procedure. The idea that <b>insecure</b> attachments are synonymous with RAD is, in fact, not accurate and leads to ambiguity when formally discussing attachment theory as it has evolved in the research literature. This is not to suggest that the concept of RAD is without merit, but rather that the clinical and research conceptualizations of <b>insecure</b> attachment and attachment disorder are not synonymous.|$|E
5|$|After William the Conqueror {{defeated}} Harold Godwinson and the English at the Battle of Hastings on 14 October 1066, {{he continued}} to face resistance to his rule {{in the north of}} England. For a number of years, William's position was very <b>insecure.</b> In order to project his influence northwards to control the people of the Danelaw (an area that had for a time been under the control of Scandinavian settlers), he constructed a number of major castles in the North and Midlands of England: including those at Warwick, Nottingham and York. After gaining control of York, the Conqueror turned southwards and arrived at the Roman and Viking city of Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|American Beauty is a 1999 American drama film {{directed}} by Sam Mendes and written by Alan Ball. Kevin Spacey stars as Lester Burnham, a 42-year-old advertising executive {{who has a}} midlife crisis when he becomes infatuated with his teenage daughter's best friend, Angela (Mena Suvari). Annette Bening co-stars as Lester's materialistic wife, Carolyn, and Thora Birch plays their <b>insecure</b> daughter, Jane. Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, and Allison Janney also feature. The film is described by academics as a satire of American middle-class notions of beauty and personal satisfaction; analysis {{has focused on the}} film's explorations of romantic, and paternal love, sexuality, beauty, materialism, self-liberation, and redemption.|$|E
5|$|As Ukrainian {{psychiatrist}} Ada Korotenko notes, {{the use of}} punitive psychiatry allowed {{of avoiding}} the judicial procedure during which the accused might declare the impossibility to speak publicly and the violation of their civil rights. Making a psychiatric diagnosis is <b>insecure</b> and can {{be based on a}} preconception. Moreover, while diagnosing mental illness, subjective fuzzy diagnostic criteria are involved as arguments. The lack of clear diagnostic criteria and clearly defined standards of diagnostics contributes to applying punitive psychiatry to vigorous and gifted citizens who disagree with authorities. At the same time, most psychiatrists incline to believe that such a misdiagnosis is less dangerous than not diagnosing mental illness.|$|E
5|$|During her regency in Hungary, Elizabeth faced several rebellions led by John Horvat and John of Palisna, who {{attempted}} {{to take advantage of}} Mary's <b>insecure</b> reign. In 1385, they invited King CharlesIII of Naples to depose Mary and assume the crown. Elizabeth responded by having Charles murdered two months after his coronation, in 1386. She had the crown restored to her daughter and established herself as regent once more, only to be captured, imprisoned and ultimately strangled by her enemies.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth was {{regarded}} by her contemporaries as an efficient but ruthless politician who used political intrigues {{to protect and}} defend her daughters' rights. She was a caring parent, but was neither politically talented nor competent to prepare Mary and Hedwig for their roles as monarchs. Elizabeth failed to {{set a good example}} for her daughters, and her unbalanced character and questionable methods in politics would serve more as a warning to the young sovereigns. Her procrastinations and inability to make clear decisions threatened Hedwig's status, while her endless problems with Croatian nobles and failure to improve relations with her native Bosnia made Mary's reign <b>insecure</b> and tumultuous.|$|E
5|$|George's {{reign of}} almost 50 years (the longest in modern Greek history) was {{characterized}} by territorial gains as Greece established its place in pre-World War I Europe. Britain ceded the Ionian Islands peacefully, while Thessaly was annexed from the Ottoman Empire after the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878). Greece was not always successful in its territorial ambitions; it was defeated in the Greco-Turkish War (1897). During the First Balkan War, after Greek troops had captured much of Greek Macedonia, George was assassinated in Thessaloniki. Compared to his own long tenure, the reigns of his successors Constantine, Alexander, and George II proved short and <b>insecure.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hoàng Cao Khải, the French-installed viceroy of Tonkin, {{perceived}} Phan's {{intent to}} a degree that his French masters did not. Khai was from a scholar-gentry family from the same village as Phan. He became the main backer of a determined effort to crush Phan's forces, using every means available: political, psychological and economic. By late 1894, relatives and suspected sympathisers of the insurgents were intimidated and more resistance commanders had been killed. Communications were disrupted, and the rebel hideouts became increasingly <b>insecure.</b> In an attempt to force Phan to surrender, the French arrested his family and desecrated the tombs of his ancestors, publicly displaying the remains in Hà Tĩnh.|$|E
5|$|In December 1999, it {{was found}} that Netscape Communicator used ROT13 as part of an <b>insecure</b> scheme to store email passwords. In 2001, Russian {{programmer}} Dimitry Sklyarov demonstrated that an eBook vendor, New Paradigm Research Group (NPRG), used ROT13 to encrypt their documents; it has been speculated that NPRG may have mistaken the ROT13 toy example—provided with the Adobe eBook software development kit—for a serious encryption scheme. Windows XP uses ROT13 on some of its registry keys. ROT13 is also used in the Unix fortune program to conceal potentially offensive dicta.|$|E
5|$|In early 1345, Kantakouzenos sent Franciscan monks to the regency to make {{an offer}} of conciliation, but it was rejected. Despite this show of confidence, the regency's {{position}} remained <b>insecure.</b> The defections of the previous winter had weakened their control of the capital, and in response Apokaukos launched a series of proscriptions. He also ordered {{the construction of a}} new prison to house political prisoners. On 11 June 1345, while undertaking an inspection of the prison unaccompanied by his bodyguard, Apokaukos was lynched by the prisoners.|$|E
5|$|<b>Insecure</b> {{attachment}} {{styles in}} toddlers involve unusual reunions after separation from a familiar person. The children may snub the returning caregiver, or {{may go to}} the person but then resist being picked up. They may reunite with the caregiver, but then persistently cling to him/her, and fail {{to return to their}} previous play. These children {{are more likely to have}} later social problems with peers and teachers, but some of them spontaneously develop better ways of interacting with other people.|$|E
5|$|James was {{the only}} son of Mary, Queen of Scots, and her second husband, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley. Both Mary and Darnley were great-grandchildren of Henry VII of England through Margaret Tudor, the older sister of Henry VIII. Mary's rule over Scotland was <b>insecure,</b> {{and she and her}} husband, being Roman Catholics, faced a {{rebellion}} by Protestant noblemen. During Mary's and Darnley's difficult marriage, Darnley secretly allied himself with the rebels and conspired in the murder of the Queen's private secretary, David Rizzio, just three months before James's birth.|$|E
5|$|Larter defined Clear {{as a girl}} who's {{suffered}} numerous {{losses in}} her life, has fallen into herself, and has made a life within that. She broadened her description as an estranged artist who's holding to her grip for what the world has given her. In the original screenplay of James Wong and Glen Morgan, she is described as the loner in the group who wears dark colors to hide her sex appeal, something she's <b>insecure</b> about. Larter dyed her hair brunette {{for the majority of}} the film to suit Clear's gothic outlook. Despite this, Larter reverted to her original blonde hair colour for the film's ending.|$|E
5|$|Princess Elsa of Arendelle {{possesses}} cryokinetic magic, often {{using it}} to play with her younger sister, Anna. After Elsa accidentally injures Anna with her magic, their parents, the King and Queen, rush both siblings to a colony of trolls led by Grand Pabbie. He heals Anna, but alters her memories to remove traces of Elsa’s magic, warning Elsa that she must learn to control her powers. The King and Queen isolate both sisters within the castle. Elsa shuts out Anna, causing a rift between them. Elsa suppresses her magic rather than mastering it, causing her to become more <b>insecure.</b> When the sisters are teenagers, their parents die at sea during a storm.|$|E
5|$|Since Echmarcach's {{extensive}} imperium {{appears to}} have spanned the Irish Sea region, {{it is possible that}} he was regarded as a threat by Siward, Earl of Northumbria (died 1055). There is reason to suspect that, by the mid eleventh century, this Anglo-Danish magnate extended his authority into what had previously been the Kingdom of Strathclyde. Echmarcach's apparent descent from the Uí Ímaira dynasty that once reigned over York as kingscombined with Echmarcach's accumulation of power after Knútr's demise, could well have been a cause of concern to the York-based earl. Such unease could partly account for Siward's extension of power into the Solway region, a sphere of <b>insecure</b> territory which may have been regarded as vulnerable by Echmarcach.|$|E
5|$|Sometime {{during the}} 20th or 21st Dynasty Amenhotep's {{original}} tomb was either robbed or deemed <b>insecure</b> and emptied {{and his body}} was moved for safety, probably more than once. It {{was found in the}} Deir el-Bahri Cache, hidden with the mummies of numerous New Kingdom kings and nobles in or after the late 22nd dynasty above the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut and is now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. His mummy had apparently not been looted by the 21st dynasty, and the priests who moved the mummy took care to keep the Cartonnage intact. Because of that exquisite face mask, Amenhotep's is the only royal mummy which has not been unwrapped and examined by modern Egyptologists.|$|E
5|$|The {{next few}} months were spent on {{political}} maneuvering. The increasingly <b>insecure</b> communists, who still had military and administrative control over the country, were appeased by a compromise in which Solidarity allowed General Jaruzelski to remain head of state. Jaruzelski barely won {{the vote in the}} National Assembly presidential election of 19 July 1989, even though his name was the only one on the ballot. He won through an informally arranged abstention by a sufficient number of Solidarity MPs and his position was not strong. Jaruzelski resigned as first secretary of the PZPR on 29 July.|$|E
5|$|The {{pathological}} {{absence of}} a discriminatory or selective attachment needs to be differentiated from the existence of attachments with either typical or somewhat atypical behavior patterns, known as styles or patterns. There are four attachment styles ascertained and used within developmental attachment research. These are known as secure, anxious-ambivalent, anxious-avoidant, (all organized) and disorganized. The latter three are characterised as <b>insecure.</b> These are assessed using the Strange Situation Procedure, designed to assess the quality of attachments rather than whether an attachment exists at all.|$|E
5|$|The {{system of}} pre-defining the {{indicator}} {{setting for the}} day for all Enigma operators on a given network, on which the method of characteristics depended, was changed on 15 September 1938. The one exception to this was the network used by the Sicherheitsdienst (SD)—the intelligence agency of the SS and the Nazi Party—who {{did not make the}} change until 1 July 1939. Operators now chose their own indicator setting. However, the <b>insecure</b> procedure of sending the enciphered message key twice, remained in use, and it was quickly exploited. Henryk Zygalski devised a manual method that used 26 perforated sheets, and Marian Rejewski commissioned the AVA company to produce the bomba kryptologiczna (cryptologic bomb).|$|E
5|$|A natural {{experiment}} permitted extensive study of attachment issues as researchers followed thousands of Romanian orphans adopted into Western families {{after the end}} of the Nicolae Ceauşescu regime. The English and Romanian Adoptees Study Team, led by Michael Rutter, followed some of the children into their teens, attempting to unravel the effects of poor attachment, adoption, new relationships, physical problems and medical issues associated with their early lives. Studies of these adoptees, whose initial conditions were shocking, yielded reason for optimism as many of the children developed quite well. Researchers noted that separation from familiar people is only one of many factors that help to determine the quality of development. Although higher rates of atypical <b>insecure</b> attachment patterns were found compared to native-born or early-adopted samples, 70% of later-adopted children exhibited no marked or severe attachment disorder behaviours.|$|E
5|$|A {{recurring}} plot {{element is}} {{the depiction of}} Kyle as <b>insecure</b> about Jewish traditions and beliefs. Already regarding God as cruel for allowing him to suffer from a life-threatening hemorrhoid while Cartman enjoys a million-dollar inheritance, Kyle became further appalled after being read the story of Job. He also once feared damnation for not having grown up as a Catholic. During both instances, he renounced his affiliation with Judaism, only to have his faith restored by events occurring {{at the end of}} an episode. After watching The Passion of the Christ, a shameful Kyle suddenly felt that Cartman's anti-Semitism was justified, and suggested to angry members of his synagogue that the Jews apologize for the death of Jesus. Kyle's guilt is alleviated when he encounters Mel Gibson, the film's director, and perceives him to be a deranged masochist.|$|E
5|$|Abraham {{carried on}} the {{preservation}} effort begun by Elizabeth Moreton until he and his son transferred ownership to the National Trust in 1938. The Dale family continued to farm the estate until 1945, and acted as caretakers for the National Trust until 1955. The Trust has carried out extensive repair and restoration work, including re-roofing; restoration of elements of the hall's original appearance, and removal of some painted patterning added during earlier restoration work. The familiar black-and-white colour scheme is a fashion introduced by the Victorians; originally the oak beams would have been untreated and left to age naturally to a silver colour, and the rendered infill painted ochre. In 1977 {{it was discovered that}} the stone slabs {{on the roof of the}} south range had become <b>insecure,</b> and work began on a six-phase programme of structural repairs, the final phase of which was completed in 1992. Replacement timbers have been left in their natural state.|$|E
5|$|As had {{happened}} during the Kokoda Track campaign and the Battle of Buna–Gona, estimates by Australian intelligence differed greatly from those at GHQ, as they used different methods. The intelligence staff at Blamey's Allied Land Forces Headquarters (LHQ), headed by Brigadier J. D. Rogers, {{had come up with}} a much higher figure of 3,000. I Corps produced an estimate of 1,800, which was passed on along with GHQ's estimate. The Allies' best source of intelligence, Ultra, shone no light on the matter. Finschhafen was mentioned in only five decrypted messages in the previous three months. Most of these were in the <b>insecure</b> Japanese Water Transport Code. Only after the capture of Japanese codebooks in the Battle of Sio in January 1944 were the Allies able to systematically break into the Japanese Army codes. In fact, Japanese strength in the area on 22 September was about 5,000.|$|E
5|$|Attachment {{disorders}} tend {{to occur}} in a definable set of contexts such as within some types of institutions, {{in the presence of}} repeated changes of primary caregiver or of extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs, but not all children raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder. Studies undertaken on children from Eastern European orphanages from the mid-1990s showed significantly higher levels of both forms of RAD and of <b>insecure</b> patterns of attachment in the institutionalized children, regardless of how long they had been there. It would appear that children in institutions like these are unable to form selective attachments to their caregivers. The difference between the institutionalized children and the control group had lessened in the follow-up study three years later, although the institutionalized children continued to show significantly higher levels of indiscriminate friendliness. However, even among children raised in the most deprived institutional conditions the majority did not show symptoms of this disorder.|$|E
5|$|By 1 December the {{fighting}} for Jerusalem was almost over. The Ottoman Army {{had failed to}} win any ground {{as a result of}} their counterattacks, and the advancing British troops were successfully replacing their tired comrades who were well entrenched close to Jerusalem. On 2 December the relief of the XXI Corps by the XX Corps was completed when the 10th (Irish) Division relieved the 52nd (Lowland) Division. And each side began to adjust and improve their lines, leaving <b>insecure</b> or hard to defend places. The British increased the number of soldiers in their line to create a powerful concentration. Over four days the 10th (Irish) and 74th (Yeomanry) Divisions extended their positions, while the extended position held by the 60th (2/2nd London) Division was shortened.|$|E
5|$|Cassidy Sharp (voiced by Jennifer Hale): The game's {{first female}} protagonist. Cassidy is the agent who {{attempts}} to stop Jericho {{on the train}} in the game's opening sequence. After the explosion of Lazarus' prison, she joins Jericho but is soon murdered by Lazarus. Cassidy returns as a good ghost and befriends Jericho, aiding him in his mission to stop Lazarus (a role similar to this of Cortana in the Halo series). As a little girl, Cassidy was orphaned in a vampire attack and then raised as a ward of the Darkwatch. Eventually, she became the most serious and dangerous agent in the organisation, yet really she is also deeply <b>insecure</b> about herself. If fought as the final boss, she turns into an angel.|$|E
5|$|Count Herbert II of Maine died in 1062, and William, who had betrothed {{his eldest}} son Robert to Herbert's sister Margaret, claimed the county through his son. Local nobles {{resisted}} the claim, but William invaded and by 1064 had secured control of the area. William appointed a Norman to the bishopric of Le Mans in 1065. He also allowed his son Robert Curthose to do homage to the new Count of Anjou, Geoffrey the Bearded. William's western border was thus secured, but his border with Brittany remained <b>insecure.</b> In 1064 William invaded Brittany in a campaign that remains obscure in its details. Its effect, though, was to destabilise Brittany, forcing the duke, Conan II, to focus on internal problems rather than on expansion. Conan's death in 1066 further secured William's borders in Normandy. William also benefited from his campaign in Brittany by securing the support of some Breton nobles {{who went on to}} support the invasion of England in 1066.|$|E
5|$|Disney was a shy, self-deprecating and <b>insecure</b> man {{in private}} but adopted {{a warm and}} {{outgoing}} public persona. He had high standards and high expectations of those with whom he worked. Although there have been accusations that he was racist or anti-Semitic, they have been contradicted by many who knew him. His reputation changed {{in the years after}} his death, from a purveyor of homely patriotic values to a representative of American imperialism. He nevertheless remains an important figure in the history of animation and in the cultural history of the United States, where he is considered a national cultural icon. His film work continues to be shown and adapted; his studio maintains high standards in its production of popular entertainment, and the Disney amusement parks have grown in size and number to attract visitors in several countries.|$|E
