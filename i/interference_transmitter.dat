After a battle, Mystique kills the Quiet Man, saves her former field-handler Shortpack, and discovers the Quiet Man's <b>interference</b> <b>transmitter</b> was a fake. She tries to steal Forge's <b>interference</b> <b>transmitter</b> but is caught. After some angry words, he smashes it and tells her he never wants to see her again. The two share a sad goodbye kiss and Mystique leaves. After Mystique is gone, Forge realizes that she had already switched his transmitter for the fake one.|$|E
50|$|One of Xavier's enemies, the Quiet Man, who is {{actually}} Prudence Leighton inhabiting {{the body of}} her assassin, contacts Mystique and offers to give her an <b>interference</b> <b>transmitter</b> which would keep her safe from the authorities if she kills Xavier. Creating {{a plan that would}} free her from both men, Mystique pretends to try killing Xavier while secretly working with the mutant thief Fantomex, after alerting Forge to stop her at the last moment. Her plan is to have the Quiet Man see this and believe that she really has attempted to kill Xavier and is still working for him. The other X-Men believe that Mystique has tried killing Xavier and seek her out.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Since {{the rapid}} {{developing}} of economy in Taiwan in recently years, a {{large numbers of}} constructions have made the changes on theterrain surrounding of the radio monitoring stations rapidly. Hence, the accuracy performance of the radio monitoring station configured by signal angle of arrival (AOA) location technology has been seriously degraded. In this paper, the simulated result of 20 km ~ 30 km coverage area is evaluated. Furthermore, the implementation and experiments supported by the radio frequency interference have been governed by authority of national communication commissions (NCC) in Taiwan. The {{results show that the}} locating accuracy at circle error probability (CEP) 50 % is less than 950 m distance under multi-path effect in metropolitan area. Hence, the solution of integrated the AOA/TDOA technologies can be applied and the <b>interference</b> <b>transmitter</b> characterized with low transmitted power, burst and weak signal and metropolitan interference is easy identified, analyzed (located) and prevented...|$|E
40|$|The mobile-satellite-service channel simulator, {{which is}} a {{facility}} for an end-to-end hardware simulation of mobile satellite communications links is discussed. Propagation effects, Doppler, interference, band limiting, satellite nonlinearity, and thermal noise have been incorporated into the simulator. The propagation {{environment in which the}} simulator needs to operate and the architecture of the simulator are described. The simulator is composed of: a mobile/fixed <b>transmitter,</b> <b>interference</b> <b>transmitters,</b> a propagation path simulator, a spacecraft, and a fixed/mobile receiver. Data from application experiments conducted with the channel simulator are presented; the noise converison technique to evaluate interference effects, the error floor phenomenon of digital multipath fading links, and the fade margin associated with a noncoherent receiver are examined.

50|$|On shared antenna sites, the {{bandpass}} duplexer {{variety is}} greatly preferred because this virtually eliminates <b>interference</b> between <b>transmitters</b> and receivers by removing {{out of band}} transmit emissions and considerably improving the selectivity of receivers. Most professionally engineered sites ban the use of notch duplexers and insist on bandpass duplexers for this reason.|$|R
40|$|Wireless {{communication}} is inherently vulnerable {{in nature and}} packets can be corrupted due to various reasons. The network performance can potentially be improved if one is {{able to identify the}} reasons for packet corruption and react to them accordingly. However, none of the current wireless protocols do so. In this paper, we design a novel scheme to diagnose packet corruption in OFDM wireless networks by statistically analyzing certain available physical layer information, based on the observation that different causes of corruption result in different per-symbol-SINR patterns within a packet. Our approach introduces no additional traffic overhead. By running experiments on a GNU radio test bed in an electromagnetic anechoic chamber, we study and demonstrate that one can separate three reasons for packet corruption: weak signal, <b>interference</b> from <b>transmitters</b> using the same band, and <b>interference</b> from <b>transmitters</b> using an adjacent band. We study three statistical classification methods and compare their accuracy...|$|R

50|$|A simple {{frequency}} allocation {{problem can be}} specified as follows: a number of transmitters in a wireless network must choose a frequency channel on which they will transmit data. To avoid <b>interference,</b> <b>transmitters</b> that are geographically close should use channels with frequencies that are far apart. If this condition is approximated with a single threshold to define 'geographically close' and 'far apart', then a valid channel choice again corresponds to a graph homomorphism: from the graph of transmitters G, with edges between pairs that are geographically close, to the graph of channels H, with edges between channels that are far apart. While this model is rather simplified, it does admit some flexibility: transmitter pairs that are not close but could interfere because of geographical features can added {{to the edge of}} G, while those that do not communicate at the same time can be removed from it. Similarly, channel pairs that are far apart but exhibit harmonic interference can be removed from the edge set of H.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{negative}} impacts of <b>interference</b> <b>transmitters</b> on automatic modulation classification (AMC) have been discussed. We proposed two approaches for AMC {{in the presence}} of interference: single user modulation classification (SUMC) and multiuser modulation classification (MUMC). When the received power of one transmitter is larger than the other transmitters, SUMC approach recognizes the modulation type of that transmitter and other transmitters are treated as interferences. Alternatively when the received powers of all transmitters are close to each other we propose MUMC method to recognize the modulation type of all of the transmitted signals. The features being used to recognize the modulation types of transmitters for both approaches, SUMC and MUMC are higher order cumulants. The super-position property of cumulants for independent random variables is utilized for SUMC and MUMC. We investigated the robustness of our classifier with respect to different powers of the received signals via analytical and simulation results and we have shown the analytical results will be confirmed by simulations. Also we studied the effect of signal synchroni-zation error via simulation results in the both condition for MUMC and SUMC.

50|$|The {{original}} frequency was 162.550 MHz, with 163.275 MHz recommended as a backup. However, this frequency {{was dropped}} due to interference issues with other federal agencies, and 162.400 MHz was added in 1970; the 162.475 MHz frequency was introduced for NWR transmission in 1975 (the use of 162.475 {{for several years}} was limited only to special cases where required to avoid channel <b>interference,</b> and <b>transmitter</b> power output was restricted to 300 Watts).

It stopped broadcasting analogue television when the digital switchover was completed on 27 June 2012. When in analogue service, the broadcast power of 30kW for a main transmitter was unique in the United Kingdom, the strength being limited by potential <b>interference</b> with <b>transmitters</b> in France and the Low Countries.|$|R
