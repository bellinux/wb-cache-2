5|$|As the <b>demographics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{readership}} broadened, {{it became}} possible to include characters {{who were more}} or less undisguised homosexuals, but these, in accordance with the attitudes of the times, tended to be villains: evil, demented, or effeminate stereotypes. The most popular role for the homosexual was as a 'decadent slaveholding lordling' whose corrupt tyranny was doomed to be overthrown by the young male heterosexual hero. During this period, lesbians were almost entirely unrepresented as either heroes or villains.|$|E

5|$|Incorrect {{figures are}} {{sometimes}} cited {{for the population}} of ASL speakers in the United States based on misunderstandings of known statistics. <b>Demographics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deaf population have been confused with those of ASL use, since adults who become deaf late in life rarely use ASL in the home. This accounts for currently cited estimations which are greater than 500,000; such mistaken estimations can reach as high as 15,000,000. A 100,000-person lower bound has been cited for ASL users; {{the source of this}} figure is unclear, but it may be an estimate of prelingual deafness, which is correlated with but not equivalent to signing.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of heavy industry attracted thousands of European {{immigrants in the}} late 19th and early 20th centuries, as well as internal migrants, both black and white, from the rural and small town South.

Sviatoslav's campaign established the Rus's hold on the north-south trade routes, helping to alter the <b>demographics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region.
