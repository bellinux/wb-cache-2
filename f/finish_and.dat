40|$|Introduction: The success {{achieved}} {{by the use of}} composite resins in anterior teeth precipitately leads their use in posterior teeth. However, the indiscriminate application of these materials in cavities with several diverse sizes rapidly pointed out their lack of resistance to oclusal and proximal wear. Objective: To evaluate the surface roughness of composite resin in relation to <b>finishing</b> <b>and</b> polishing technique. Material and methods: Eight experimental groups (n = 15) were divided according to <b>finishing</b> <b>and</b> polishing technique: G 1 – Z 250 TM composite resin without surface <b>finishing</b> <b>and</b> polishing; G 2 – Z 250 TM composite resin plus surface <b>finishing</b> <b>and</b> polishing; G 3 – P 60 TM composite resin without surface <b>finishing</b> <b>and</b> polishing; G 4 – P 60 TM composite resin plus surface <b>finishing</b> <b>and</b> polishing; G 5 – Prodigy CondensableTM composite resin without surface <b>finishing</b> <b>and</b> polishing; G 6 – Prodigy CondensableTM composite resin plus surface <b>finishing</b> <b>and</b> polishing; G 7 – SurefillTM composite resin without surface <b>finishing</b> <b>and</b> polishing; G 8 – Surefill TM composite resin plus surface <b>finishing</b> <b>and</b> polishing. Three packable and one microhybrid (control group) composite resin was used. The surface roughness was measured using a profilometer at three points in each sample. The results were evaluated by ANOVA and Tukey test (p < 0. 05). Results: Prodigy CondensableTM composite resin showed the lowest surface roughness, while Surefill TM showed the highest surface roughness. Comparing the resins used, only between P 60 TM and SurefillTM there were no statistically significant differences (p ≥ 0. 05). Conclusion: Surface roughness was lower in all types of resin composites surfaces in contact with Mylar matrix strip than in areas submitted to <b>finishing</b> <b>and</b> polishing procedure...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of <b>finishing</b> <b>and</b> polishing procedures on the surface texture of compomer materials (Dyract and Compoglass) using the Enhance <b>finishing</b> <b>and</b> polishing system. Forty-five cylindrical specimens were prepared from each material. Fifteen specimens of each material were light cured against a Mylar strip with no finishing or polishing (control), 15 others were finished only using the Enhance <b>finishing</b> system (experimental) <b>and</b> another 15 specimens were <b>finished</b> <b>and</b> polished using the Enhance <b>finishing</b> <b>and</b> polishing system (experimental). All specimens were prepared at room temperature and stored for 3 days in closed containers of distilled water (300 ml) in a laboratory oven at 37 oC before testing. Both control and experimental specimens of each material were examined and photographed at different magnifications using a stereomicroscope and an SEM. Also, the surface roughness of all specimens was measured with a surface roughness analyzer. The surfaces cured against the Mylar strip demonstrated the smoothest surface. Following the Mylar strip surface, the next smoothest surface was seen in <b>finished</b> <b>and</b> polished Dyract followed by <b>finished</b> Compoglass. <b>Finishing</b> <b>and</b> polishing procedures of compomer materials failed to reproduce the smoothness of surfaces created by mylar strips...|$|R

40|$|In this study, surface {{roughness}} of three esthetic materials namely composite resin, resin-modified glass ionomer, and a compomer were examined using three <b>finishing</b> <b>and</b> polishing systems. Thirty samples of each material were prepared. Ten samples from each material were then <b>finished</b> <b>and</b> polished {{with one of}} the three systems (Sof-Lex discs, a combination of diamond and silicone points, <b>and</b> carbide <b>finishing</b> burs). Surface roughness (R) of the samples after <b>finishing</b> <b>and</b> polishing were measured using a perthometer. The results showed that Sof-Lex discs and a combination of diamond and silicone points produced significantly better <b>finished</b> <b>and</b> polished surfaces on composite resin than on the other two materials. The roughest surfaces were obtained by carbide burs on glass ionomer (Photac-Fil). Although a combination of diamond and silicone points could provide acceptable <b>finishing</b> <b>and</b> polishing surfaces for composite resin and resin-modified glass ionomer surfaces, Sof-Lex discs provided smoother surfaces.
