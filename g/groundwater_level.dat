5|$|The northwestern and {{northern}} {{portions of the}} Yucatán Peninsula experience lower rainfall {{than the rest of}} the peninsula; these regions feature highly porous limestone bedrock resulting in less surface water. This limestone geology results in most rainwater filtering directly through the bedrock to the phreatic zone, from whence it slowly flows to the coasts to form large submarine springs. Various freshwater springs rise along the coast to form watering holes. The filtering of rainwater through the limestone has caused the formation of extensive cave systems. These cave rooves are subject to collapse forming deep sinkholes; if the bottom of the cave is deeper than the <b>groundwater</b> <b>level</b> then a cenote is formed.|$|E
5|$|Delhi's {{municipal}} water supply is {{managed by the}} Delhi Jal Board (DJB). , it supplied 650million gallons per day (MGD), whereas the estimated consumption requirement is 963MGD. The shortfall is met by private and public tube wells and hand pumps. At 240MGD, the Bhakra storage is DJB's largest water source, followed by the Yamuna and Ganges rivers. Delhi's <b>groundwater</b> <b>level</b> is falling and its population density is increasing, so residents often encounter acute water shortage. Research on Delhi suggests that {{up to half of}} the city's water use is unofficial groundwater.In Delhi, daily domestic solid waste production is 8000tonnes which is dumped at three landfill locations by MCD. The daily domestic waste water production is 470MGD and industrial waste water is 70MGD. A large portion of the sewage flows untreated into the Yamuna river.|$|E
25|$|A main {{consideration}} regarding timber piles is {{that they}} should be protected from rotting above <b>groundwater</b> <b>level.</b> Timber will last for a long time below the <b>groundwater</b> <b>level.</b> For timber to rot, two elements are needed: water and oxygen. Below the <b>groundwater</b> <b>level,</b> dissolved oxygen is lacking even though there is ample water. Hence, timber tends to last for a long time below <b>groundwater</b> <b>level.</b> In 1648 the Royal Palace of Amsterdam was constructed on 13659 timber piles that still survive today since they were below <b>groundwater</b> <b>level.</b> Timber that is to be used above the water table can be protected from decay and insects by numerous forms of wood preservation using pressure treatment (alkaline copper quaternary (ACQ), chromated copper arsenate (CCA), creosote, etc.).|$|E

Trends in the contemporary groundwater record (20 and 30 years) indicate increases (rises) or no substantial change in <b>groundwater</b> <b>levels</b> in all months for most wells throughout northern New England. The highest percentage of increasing 20 -year trends was in February through March, May through August, and October through November.

25|$|In {{cases where}} no reuse is {{possible}} or desired, urine is usually infiltrated {{in the soil}} unless this practice would cause groundwater pollution. In eThekwini municipality in South Africa or in Lima, Peru, for example, urine from UDDTs is safely infiltrated into the soil because the <b>groundwater</b> <b>level</b> is very low there and the groundwater is not used for any particular purpose. Infiltration {{can be done by}} directing the urine to a soak pit or by running a perforated urine pipe from the toilet to an area outside, where the hose is sloping gently downhill (for rural areas). Clogging of the pipe's holes can be avoided by ensuring there are no T-junctions, no joints and that a plastic mesh is installed in the urine funnel of the toilet to keep everything other than urine out.|$|E
25|$|Between 1985 and 2005 {{the level}} of {{groundwater}} in the Barada basin, on which Damascus sits, declined from 50 meters to 200 meters. Intensive groundwater use began in the 1960s. Prior to that the <b>groundwater</b> <b>level</b> in the ghouta was 1-3m below the surface in winter and 2-10m in summer. The main source of water for irrigation {{at the time were}} the various branches of the Barada River. Landlords ensured that irrigation canals were maintained, and surface water was distributed through an intricate system called whereby farmers took turns (Qirat) whose length varied depending on factors such as the size of their plots and distance from the canals. After a land reform in 1958 newly created cooperatives were unable to maintain the irrigation canals and to implement the distribution system. Furthermore, surface water was increasingly polluted. As a result, farmers drilled wells - usually without a permit - and thus began the overexploitation of groundwater that persists until today.|$|E
25|$|Many {{of these}} UDDTs serve {{indigenous}} communities who live along small rivers {{as well as}} ecotourism operations in the Amazonian part of the country. In these regions, piped water supply is often lacking, clay-rich soils do not permit infiltration of wastewater, and the <b>groundwater</b> <b>level</b> is usually high. These factors make other types of toilets {{or other forms of}} excreta management problematic. For example, local governments and ecotourism operations often install flush toilets that drain straight into rivers or into holes in the ground, where the water is intended to drain but cannot, since the soil is mostly impermeable clay. Coupled with the abundant local rainfall, these pits tend to fill very fast and overflow into the nearest streams. The streams get easily contaminated with fecal matter, as they are often quite small and there is not much dilution with clean river water. This leads to health hazards for the communities who use these rivers for drinking water, washing, swimming, and fishing.|$|E

To estimate the extent at which the <b>groundwater</b> <b>levels</b> are influenced by the ocean surface levels, we compute the coherence between them. Let us assume that there is a linear relationship between the ocean surface height and the <b>groundwater</b> <b>levels.</b> We further assume that the ocean surface height controls the <b>groundwater</b> <b>levels</b> so that we take the ocean surface height as the input variable, and the groundwater well height as the output variable.|$|R

40|$|International audienceTo {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} variations in rainfall on groundwater, long-term rainfall records were used to simulate <b>groundwater</b> <b>levels</b> over the period 1953 - 96 at an experimental catchment in south-east Zimbabwe. Two different modelling methods were adopted. Firstly, a soil water balance model (ACRU) simulated drainage from daily rainfall and evaporative demand; <b>groundwater</b> <b>levels</b> were predicted {{as a function of}} drainage, specific yield and water table height. Secondly, the cumulative rainfall departure method was used to model <b>groundwater</b> <b>levels</b> from monthly rainfall. Both methods simulated observed <b>groundwater</b> <b>levels</b> over the period 1992 - 96 successfully, and long-term simulated trends in historical levels were comparable. Results suggest that large perturbations in <b>groundwater</b> <b>levels</b> area a normal feature of the response of a shallow aquifer to variations in rainfall. Long-term trends in <b>groundwater</b> <b>levels</b> are apparent and reflect the effect of cycles in rainfall. Average end of dry season water levels were simulated to be almost 3 m higher in the late 1970 s compared to those of the early 1990 s.

2500|$|The {{main purpose}} of the test is to provide an {{indication}} of the relative density of granular deposits, such as sands and gravels from which {{it is virtually impossible to}} obtain undisturbed samples. [...] The great merit of the test, and the main reason for its widespread use is that it is simple and inexpensive. The soil strength parameters which can be inferred are approximate, but may give a useful guide in ground conditions where it may not be possible to obtain borehole samples of adequate quality like gravels, sands, silts, clay containing sand or gravel and weak rock. In conditions where the quality of the undisturbed sample is suspect, e.g., very silty or very sandy clays, or hard clays, it is often advantageous to alternate the sampling with standard penetration tests to check the strength. If the samples are found to be unacceptably disturbed, it may be necessary to use a different method for measuring strength like the plate test. [...] When the test is carried out in granular soils below <b>groundwater</b> <b>level,</b> the soil may become loosened. In certain circumstances, it can be useful to continue driving the sampler beyond the distance specified, adding further drilling rods as necessary. Although this is not a standard penetration test, and should not be regarded as such, it may at least give an indication as to whether the deposit is really as loose as the standard test may indicate.|$|E
