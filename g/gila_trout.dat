5|$|The Navajo were an Athabaskan {{people who}} {{migrated}} {{from the north}} into the Colorado River basin around 1025 A.D. They soon established themselves as the dominant Native American tribe in the Colorado River basin, and their territory stretched over parts of present-day Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Colorado – in the original homelands of the Puebloans. In fact, the Navajo acquired agricultural skills from the Puebloans before {{the collapse of the}} Pueblo civilization in the 14thcentury. A profusion of other tribes have made a continued, lasting presence along the Colorado River. The Mohave have lived along the rich bottomlands of the lower Colorado below Black Canyon since 1200 A.D. They were fishermen – navigating the river on rafts made of reeds to catch <b>Gila</b> <b>trout</b> and Colorado pikeminnow – and farmers, relying on the annual floods of the river rather than irrigation to water their crops. Ute peoples have inhabited the northern Colorado River basin, mainly in present-day Colorado, Wyoming and Utah, for at least 2,000 years, but did not become well established in the Four Corners area until 1500 A.D. The Apache, Cocopah, Halchidhoma, Havasupai, Hualapai, Maricopa, Pima, and Quechan are among many other groups that live along or had territories bordering on the Colorado River and its tributaries.|$|E
500|$|Cutthroat trout {{naturally}} interbreed {{with the}} closely related rainbow trout, producing fertile hybrids commonly called [...] "cutbows". This hybrid generally bears similar coloration and overall appearance to the cutthroat trout, usually retaining the characteristic orange-red slash. Cutbow hybrids often pose a taxonomic difficulty {{when trying to}} distinguish any given specimen as a rainbow or cutthroat trout. In addition, cutthroat trout may hybridize with [...] the <b>Gila</b> <b>trout</b> and [...] the Apache trout in regions where their ranges overlap.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Gila</b> <b>trout</b> is {{native to}} tributaries of the Gila River in Arizona and New Mexico. The <b>Gila</b> <b>trout</b> is found {{historically}} in the Verde and Agua Fria drainages in Arizona. Natural fish barriers prevented <b>Gila</b> <b>trout</b> from entering the upper Tonto Creek drainage (AZ). <b>Gila</b> <b>trout</b> have persisted in five streams within the Gila National Forest, New Mexico, including: Iron, McKenna, and Spruce creeks in the Gila Wilderness Area, along with Main and South Diamond creeks in the Aldo Leopold Wilderness Area.|$|E
30|$|As {{with other}} closely related salmonid species, stream {{temperatures}} {{in excess of}} 20 °C are considered unfavorable during various stages of the <b>Gila</b> <b>trout’s</b> life cycle (Alcorn 1976, Lee and Rinne 1980). A decade later, stream temperatures in Dude Creek continued to average in excess of 20 °C over several weeks {{during the summer of}} 2011 and reached nearly 27 °C on the warmest day of the year. This supports the concept that alteration of thermal regimes within stream channels following wildfire events can be a driving force in the distribution, abundance, growth, and persistence of aquatic species (Isaak et al. 2010).|$|R
50|$|<b>Gila</b> <b>trout</b> have {{a yellow}} body, with black spots. The average total length is about 300.0 mm (11.8 in.); with {{maximum total length}} {{approximately}} 550.0 mm (21.7 in.). <b>Gila</b> <b>trout</b> {{are closely related to}} Apache trout. However, Apache trout can have a spot behind and in front of the pupil (eye) and big noticeable spots on the body whereas <b>Gila</b> <b>trout</b> are characterized by numerous small dark spots on the upper half of the body.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Gila</b> <b>trout</b> (Oncorhynchus gilae) is {{a species}} of salmonid, related to the rainbow, native to the Southwest United States. Prior to 2006 the <b>Gila</b> <b>trout</b> was federally listed as endangered. In July 2006, after much work by the Game and Fish {{departments}} in New Mexico and Arizona, the US Forest Service and the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the <b>Gila</b> <b>trout</b> was down-listed to threatened, with a special provision called a [...] "4d rule" [...] that will allow limited sport fishing - {{for the first time}} in nearly half a century. This possibility is distinct: there may be no one alive today that has legally angled a pure <b>Gila</b> <b>trout</b> from its native waters. By the time the <b>Gila</b> <b>trout</b> was closed to fishing in the 1950s, its numbers and range were so depleted and so reduced this copper-colored trout simply wasn’t very accessible to anglers. As of 2011 there is fishing in both states for this beautiful fish.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Gila</b> <b>trout</b> {{has been}} {{threatened}} by competition and hybridization with introduced game fish {{such as the}} rainbow trout. However, {{the primary cause of}} reduced <b>Gila</b> <b>trout</b> populations is habitat loss caused by loss of water flow and shade-giving trees, caused in turn by fires, human destruction of riparian vegetation, livestock overgrazing, agricultural irrigation and water diversion, and channelization of streams in the Gila trout's native range. By the time the <b>Gila</b> <b>trout</b> was listed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1967 its range had reduced from several hundred miles of stream to just 20 in the Gila Wilderness and Aldo Leopold Wilderness. After listing USFWS began an aggressive program of stream restoration, removing the introduced trout, restoring and repairing riparian vegetation (to maintain cooler water temperatures), and restocking restored streams with young <b>Gila</b> <b>trout.</b> The Mora National Fish Hatchery and Technology Center in northern New Mexico keeps brood stocks of the <b>Gila</b> <b>trout</b> and supplies the fish for restocking. The species is now more secure {{than it was in the}} 1970s, having been moved to 10 new streams, though populations and habitat are still far below those originally established. Conservationists hope to eventually delist the species and allow fishing, thus forming alliances with fishermen in order to help preserve the species. Major wildfires and drought will always play a major role in the status of any trout species.|$|E
50|$|Scientists at the Mora {{hatchery}} keep brood {{stocks of}} the <b>Gila</b> <b>trout,</b> maintaining them in as natural a setting as possible. They keep the <b>Gila</b> <b>trout</b> in tanks with woody cover, current flow, {{and with other}} fishes that naturally associate in the wild, like the desert and Sonoran sucker. Culturing fish in as natural an environment as possible is intended to maintain wild characteristics so that the offspring are well-suited to face {{the rigors of the}} wild.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gila</b> <b>trout</b> can {{be found}} in small {{mountain}} water streams, and in confined pools. They are opportunistic feeders that feed on aquatic insects such as trichopterans, ephemeropterans, chironomids, and coleopterans, as well as small fishes.|$|E
50|$|Boating {{and fishing}} are popular on San Carlos Lake and other basin reservoirs, {{including}} Lake Pleasant and Theodore Roosevelt Lake. The river system has 36 fish species, including largemouth bass, sunfish, channel catfish, flathead catfish and <b>Gila</b> <b>Trout</b> (Oncorhynchus gilae gilae).|$|E
50|$|Reptiles {{such as the}} Arizona {{coral snake}} and Gila monster are rarely present; common snakes include the black-tailed rattlesnake, rock rattlesnake, and Sonora {{mountain}} kingsnake. Brown trout, rainbow trout, catfish and bass are found in rivers and streams. The threatened <b>Gila</b> <b>trout</b> is present in Iron, McKenna and Spruce Creeks. It prefers sufficiently deep water, such as American beaver ponds, which provide hiding places and can withstand both floods and drought.|$|E
50|$|This is {{a fairly}} stable {{ecoregion}} with about 25% of original habitat still intact although vulnerable to logging and overgrazing. Pollution and reduction of rivers are threatening specific plants and animals including Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii) and Goodding's willow (Salix gooddingii), the threatened <b>Gila</b> <b>trout</b> (Oncorhynchus gilae), and the endangered southwestern willow flycatcher (Empidonax traillii extimus). Logging continues to remove habitat of the Mexican spotted owl (Strix occidentalis lucida) and the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentalis).|$|E

50|$|The Apache trout is {{the state}} fish of Arizona, {{and is one of}} only two species of trout native to that state, with the other being the <b>gila</b> <b>trout</b> (O. g. gilae). It {{natively}} lives in clear, cool streams in the White Mountains that flow through coniferous forests and marshes, but has been introduced into several lakes in the area. The Apache trout is native to the upper Salt River watershed (Black and White rivers) and the upper Little Colorado River watershed. Apache trout have been introduced into isolated streams outside of their historic range in the Pinaleno Mountains and the North Rim of the Grand Canyon.|$|E
5000|$|The {{wilderness}} area has fauna {{typical of the}} American Southwest: mule deer, elk, spotted owl, gray fox, wild turkey, bobcat, peccary, black bear and cougar. Of note is the effort to reintroduce the Mexican wolf to the region. The native <b>Gila</b> <b>trout</b> has been brought back from the verge of extinction and now exists in small populations in Diamond Creek, South Diamond Creek and Black Canyon {{on the west side}} of the Black Range. A population of Rio Grande cutthroat trout survives in Holden Prong of Las Animas Creek on the east side of the Black Range. [...] The Mimbres River has its headwaters in the Wilderness.|$|E
5000|$|The Mora National Fish Hatchery and Technology Center is one {{of seven}} federal fish {{hatchery}} technology centers in the United States.

30|$|Finally, {{we found}} that the {{combination}} of the decrease in canopy closure and presence of exposed bedrock substrate within Dude Creek was contributing to increased water temperatures. Prior to the fire, all the streams in this study were considered habitats for salmonid fishes. Based on this fact, native <b>Gila</b> <b>trout</b> (Oncorhynchus gilae Miller, 1950) was reintroduced into Dude Creek following the fire under the <b>Gila</b> <b>Trout</b> Recovery Plan (Pittenger 2002), with the assumption that the stream would still provide suitable habitat for salmonids. Stocking occurred from the late 1990 s to early 2000 s. Unfortunately, these efforts ultimately proved unsuccessful (Kline and Carter 2011), most likely due to a shift to higher water temperatures following the fire.|$|E
40|$|In 1995, Squaw and Flash creeks were renovated with Antimycin-A to {{eradicate}} non-native fish. After renovation, 129 Apache trout from Flash Creek were introduced into Squaw Creek. Two years later, all size classes were present. Apache trout above a natural barrier on Flash Creek {{were allowed to}} repopulate the renovated section. Three years later, 45 Apache trout were found below the natural barrier. In both streams, adults selected deep, slow moving areas. Juveniles selected shallow areas with fast currents. Both size classes selected open areas exposed to sunlight with surface turbulence {{and other forms of}} instream cover. Apache and <b>Gila</b> <b>trout</b> were experimentally PIT-tagged in the: (1) pelvic girdle; (2) abdominal cavity; and (3) dorsal musculature to determine the best tagging location.

40|$|The Gila National Forest {{in southwestern}} New Mexico harbors two imperiled aquatic species in its mid-to-high {{elevation}} streams, the Gila chub and the <b>Gila</b> <b>trout.</b> Modern and historical land use pressures, {{and the introduction}} of non-native fishes, have reduced the range of the <b>Gila</b> <b>trout</b> to a handful of headwater streams. The remaining populations are highly fragmented. The Gila National Forest was an early pioneer in the use of naturally ignited wildfire to achieve resource benefi ts. Fish populations can be harmed by fire in some cases, however, even when they have evolved with fire. This occurs when populations dwindle and fi sh habitat connectivity changes through introduction of non-native fish and human impacts downstream, which sometimes make it difficult for fish to migrate to a more favorable location. A retrospective study using satellite sensor and weather information has documented the effects of forest composition, elevation and slope, snow pack, and seasonal and annual variability in precipitation on burn severity in the Gila. Information on past burn severity may help resource managers plan for actions before and during fire seasons to ensure the long-term survival of the <b>Gila</b> <b>trout</b> and Gila chub. In addition, predicting the likelihood and location of severe fire and potential debris and ash flows can help managers decide which streams are best suited to support fish populations for the long term. The ultimate aim is to bolster populations of native trout and promote connectivity of habitat where the fish stand a good chance of thriving. The fate of the endangered chub is even more precarious...|$|E

30|$|One {{potential}} undesirable {{effect of}} moderate burn severity is the {{increased risk of}} high severity burn patches within the moderate severity burn matrix. The fires we studied consisted {{of only a few}} moderate-high burn severity patches that were relatively small (< 120 ha). This would indicate that these fires burned under moderate weather conditions and were mostly beneficial. Small pockets of high burn severity can be very effective at breaking up fuel continuity and creating wildlife habitat on a landscape (Rollins et al. 2001). On the other hand, larger patches of high burn severity can result in undesirable effects such as increased runoff and erosion, which may be detrimental to endangered species such as the <b>Gila</b> <b>trout</b> (Oncorhynchus gilae) (Brown et al. 2001). Moreover, high burn severity patches could result in complete tree mortality, loss of soil, and a possible complete type conversion (Strom and Fulé 2007).|$|E
40|$|TAXONOMIC UNIQUENESS: Ten {{species of}} Oncorhynchus occur in North America. Two are native to Arizona, O. apache and O. gilae. Behnke (1992) {{classified}} Apache trout as O. g. apache and <b>Gila</b> <b>trout</b> as O. g. gilae. DESCRIPTION: Apache trout rarely exceed 25. 0 cm (9. 8 in.) {{in the small}} stream conditions {{to which they are}} now restricted. However, they can reach over 40. 0 cm (15. 7 in.) in lakes and hatcheries (Rinne, 1990). The body is deeply compressed. Head length less than 28. 5 percent of the standard length and head width averages 13. 7 percent of the standard length (Minckley 1973). Dorsal fin is large. "Pelvic fins long, 14. 5 to 17. 0 percent of standard length, average 16. 0. Adipose dorsal fin short, 8. 5 to 11. 5 percent of standard length. Pyloric caecae 22 to 40, usually near 30. Scales in the lateral series 136 to 172, usually more than 145. Scales above lateral line 32 to 40, usually more than 35 " (Minckley 1973). Vertebrae number 58 to 61, and approximately 5 % of some populations have basibranchial teeth (Minckley 1973 and Behnke 1992). The body coloration is golden-yellow or olive yellow, with a golden belly. Parr marks persist into adults, but disappear in large individuals. Spotting pattern is an even distribution of pronounced, moderate-sized, rounded or oval black spots {{on the sides of the}} body and on top of the head. The adipose fin is usually bordered with black. The dorsal, pelvic, and anal fins are tipped with a white to orange color, and an orange to yellow cutthroat mark is present under the jaw.
