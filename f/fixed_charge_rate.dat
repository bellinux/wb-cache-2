30|$|GEOPHIRES v 2.0 {{has three}} {{built-in}} models {{to calculate the}} levelized cost of energy: (1) the <b>Fixed</b> <b>Charge</b> <b>Rate</b> (FCR) model, (2) the Standard Levelized Cost model, and (3) the BICYCLE model. If the user selects electricity or cogeneration with electricity as the main product, then GEOPHIRES calculates the LCOE in units of ¢ kWh− 1. In the case of direct-use heat or cogeneration with direct-use heat as the main product, then GEOPHIRES calculates the LCOH in units of $ MMBtu− 1 (MMBtu[*]=[*]million Btu). The code can easily be modified to present the results in other units or to calculate other metrics such as NPV, IRR and payback period. However, these metrics, unit conversions, and necessary code modifications are not discussed in this paper.|$|E

During {{the past}} few decades, all Gulf States have {{experienced}} a rapid growth in living standard, which was naturally associated with rapid increase in demand for electricity and potable water. Due to changes of living style, {{large portion of the}} electric power was consumed for air conditioning (A/C). Lack of natural water resources and striving needs for water made desalination the main technology to provide potable water. In an effort to search for a novel method for producing fresh water, the present paper investigates a combination of a heat pump (HP) with a dehumidification process to extract water from the atmospheric air. The unit supplies 1. 586 m 3 /s air to an office building (250 m 2 area) by the sea side in Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) where the average ambient temperature is 34 oC and relative humidity of 71 %. The unit has two series evaporator-coils to maximize the water condensation process by reducing the air exit temperature to 8 oC. The performance of the combined HP-Dehumidifying unit has been investigated for one year employing measured climatic conditions for representative days of the months. The maximum water production was in September (2. 23 m 3 /day) and the least was in January (0. 618 m 3 /day). The power consumed by the unit was determined and the mean specific power rate was 0. 42 kWh/liter of fresh water. The pilot unit was purchased at a relatively high cost that raises the <b>fixed</b> <b>charges</b> <b>rate,</b> the estimated maximum water cost was 23 $/m 3 for electricity rate of 0. 045 $/kWh. A more realistic estimate based on sharing the expenses between the A/C and water production processes reduced the water cost to 13. 5 $/m 3 (50. 6 Saudi Riyal/m 3). The combined A/C- Dehumidifying unit can be efficient for resort areas of high humidity, low water demand and need for air conditioning. Badr A. Habeebullah 98 1...|$|R

Executive summary: This report presents {{information and}} analysis of the network tariffs applicable to household electricity consumers in the southern and eastern states of Australia covered by the National Energy Market (NEM). The paper is the first of four papers focused on network tariffs from the perspective of households. Key findings include: 	A range of network tariff structures are used throughout the NEM. Inclining block rate tariffs (with small price increments) and two-part tariffs are common. 	The most expensive network tariff in Australia is almost four times higher than the least expensive. 	The average network charge to households in Victoria is about a third of that elsewhere in the NEM 	The gap between least expensive and most expensive network tariff has doubled over the last seven years. 	Network service providers in Queensland have the highest charges and also the greater proportion of their <b>charge</b> is <b>fixed.</b> The Queensland distributors and Ausnet Services in Victoria have increased their <b>fixed</b> <b>charges</b> significantly recently. In the 2015 / 16 year (not covered in this report Citipower and Powercor have both increased their <b>fixed</b> <b>charges</b> significantly). 	Network service providers are typically increasing <b>fixed</b> <b>charges</b> more quickly than variable charges. 	The international comparison shows that network tariffs in Britain are generally much lower than anywhere in Australia. The average network charge in Denmark and New Zealand is roughly comparable to those in Victoria, the lowest network cost jurisdiction in the NEM. 	The proportion of revenue recovered from <b>fixed</b> <b>charges</b> charged to most consumers in the NEM is higher than that in Britain, Denmark and New Zealand. Some distributors in Victoria have relatively smaller <b>fixed</b> <b>charges,</b> while those in Queensland and Essential Energy in New South Wales have <b>fixed</b> <b>charges</b> that are much higher than those found elsewhere. In NZ, network tariffs with higher <b>fixed</b> <b>charges</b> apply to households with high levels of consumption (> 9 MWh per year) ...|$|R
