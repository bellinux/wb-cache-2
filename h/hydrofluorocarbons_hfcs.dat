5|$|Halogenated refrigerants, termed Freons in {{informal}} contexts, {{are identified}} by R-numbers that denote {{the amount of}} fluorine, chlorine, carbon, and hydrogen present. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) like R-11, R-12, and R-114 once dominated organofluorines, peaking in production in the 1980s. Used for air conditioning systems, propellants and solvents, their production was below one-tenth of this peak by the early 2000s, after widespread international prohibition. Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and <b>hydrofluorocarbons</b> (<b>HFCs)</b> were designed as replacements; their synthesis consumes more than 90% of the fluorine in the organic industry. Important HCFCs include R-22, chlorodifluoromethane, and R-141b. The main HFC is R-134a with {{a new type of}} molecule HFO-1234yf, a Hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) coming to prominence owing to its global warming potential of less than 1% that of HFC-134a.|$|E
5|$|The Montreal Protocol, {{signed in}} 1987, set strict {{regulations}} on chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and bromofluorocarbons {{due to their}} ozone damaging potential (ODP). The high stability which suited them to their original applications also meant {{that they were not}} decomposing until they reached higher altitudes, where liberated chlorine and bromine atoms attacked ozone molecules. Even with the ban, and early indications of its efficacy, predictions warned that several generations would pass before full recovery. With one-tenth the ODP of CFCs, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are the current replacements, and are themselves scheduled for substitution by 2030–2040 by <b>hydrofluorocarbons</b> (<b>HFCs)</b> with no chlorine and zero ODP. In 2007 this date was brought forward to 2020 for developed countries; the Environmental Protection Agency had already prohibited one HCFC's production and capped those of two others in 2003. Fluorocarbon gases are generally greenhouse gases with global-warming potentials (GWPs) of about 100 to 10,000; sulfur hexafluoride has a value of around 20,000. An outlier is HFO-1234yf which is a new type of refrigerant called a Hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) and has attracted global demand due to its GWP of 4 compared to 1,430 for the current refrigerant standard HFC-134a.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, {{concerns}} {{developed over}} the role chlorofluorocarbons play in damaging the ozone layer. By 1996, almost all nations had banned chlorofluorocarbon refrigerants and commercial production ceased. Fluorine continued {{to play a role}} in refrigeration though: hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and <b>hydrofluorocarbons</b> (<b>HFCs)</b> were developed as replacement refrigerants.|$|E
50|$|The {{compound}} is {{the lowest}} mass member of the <b>hydrofluorocarbon</b> (<b>HFC)</b> family, compounds which contain only hydrogen, fluorine, and carbon.

3000|$|... sWidely used ODSs are CFCs, halons, carbon tetrachloride, trichloroethane, hydrobromofluorocarbons and {{hydrochlorofluorocarbon}} (HCFC). In {{the beginning}} HCFC {{was used as}} a substitute for some CFCs, but later was also substituted with other compounds such as <b>hydrofluorocarbon</b> (<b>HFC)</b> that have zero ozone depletion threat.|$|R
50|$|Natural {{refrigerants}} are {{substances that}} are viable, environmentally sustainable, natural substitute refrigerants, used in refrigeration systems (including refrigerators, HVAC, and air conditioning). They are alternatives to <b>hydrofluorocarbon</b> (<b>HFC),</b> hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) and chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) based refrigerants. Unlike other refrigerants, {{they are not}} synthetic chemicals that are not ever found in nature.|$|R
25|$|In September 2016, the {{so-called}} New York Declaration urged a global {{reduction in the}} use of HFCs. On 15 October 2016, due to these chemicals contribution to climate change, negotiators from 197 nations meeting at the summit of the United Nations Environment Programme in Kigali, Rwanda reached a legally-binding accord to phase out <b>hydrofluorocarbons</b> (<b>HFCs)</b> in an amendment to the Montreal Protocol.|$|E
25|$|Industrial {{pollutants}} such as <b>hydrofluorocarbons</b> (<b>HFCs)</b> and perfluorocarbons (PFCs) have a GWP {{many thousands}} of times greater than carbon dioxide by volume. Because these pollutants are easily captured and destroyed at their source, they present a large and low-cost source of carbon offsets. As a category, HFCs, PFCs, and N2O reductions represent 71 per cent of offsets issued under the CDM.|$|E
25|$|The {{burning of}} fossil fuels is a major source of {{greenhouse}} gas emissions, especially for power, cement, steel, textile, fertilizer and many other industries which rely on fossil fuels (coal, electricity derived from coal, natural gas and oil). The major greenhouse gases emitted by these industries are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, <b>hydrofluorocarbons</b> (<b>HFCs),</b> etc., all of which increase the atmosphere's ability to trap infrared energy and thus affect the climate.|$|E
25|$|One widely adopted {{replacement}} refrigerant is the <b>hydrofluorocarbon</b> (<b>HFC)</b> {{known as}} R-134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane). Heat pumps using R-134a replaced R-12 (dichlorodifluoromethane) and have similar thermodynamic properties but with insignificant {{ozone depletion potential}} and a somewhat lower global warming potential. Other substances such as liquid R-717 ammonia are widely used in large-scale systems, or occasionally the less corrosive but more flammable propane or butane, can also be used.|$|R
50|$|CO2 is not {{the only}} GHG {{relevant}} to mitigation, and governments have acted to regulate the emissions of other GHGs emitted by human activities (anthropogenic GHGs). The emissions caps agreed to by most developed countries under the Kyoto Protocol regulate the emissions of almost all the anthropogenic GHGs.These gases are CO2, methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), the <b>hydrofluorocarbons</b> (<b>HFC),</b> perfluorocarbons (PFC), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6).|$|R

25|$|Haloalkanes {{can also}} be {{classified}} according {{to the type of}} halogen on group 7 responding to a specific halogenoalkane. Haloalkanes containing carbon bonded to fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine results in organofluorine, organochlorine, organobromine and organoiodine compounds, respectively. Compounds containing more than one kind of halogen are also possible. Several classes of widely used haloalkanes are classified in this way chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and <b>hydrofluorocarbons</b> (<b>HFCs).</b> These abbreviations are particularly common in discussions of the environmental impact of haloalkanes.|$|E
25|$|Although CFCs are {{greenhouse}} gases, {{they are}} {{regulated by the}} Montreal Protocol, which was motivated by CFCs' contribution to ozone depletion rather than by their contribution to global warming. Note that ozone depletion has only a minor role in greenhouse warming though the two processes often are confused in the media. On 15 October 2016, negotiators from over 170 nations meeting at {{the summit of the}} United Nations Environment Programme reached a legally binding accord to phase out <b>hydrofluorocarbons</b> (<b>HFCs)</b> in an amendment to the Montreal Protocol.|$|E
25|$|Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) {{are fully}} {{halogenated}} paraffin hydrocarbons that contain only carbon, chlorine, and fluorine, produced as volatile derivative of methane, ethane, and propane. They are also commonly {{known by the}} DuPont brand name Freon. The most common representative is dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12 or Freon-12). Many CFCs {{have been widely used}} as refrigerants, propellants (in aerosol applications), and solvents. Because CFCs contribute to ozone depletion in the upper atmosphere, the manufacture of such compounds has been phased out under the Montreal Protocol, and they are being replaced with other products such as <b>hydrofluorocarbons</b> (<b>HFCs)</b> (e.g., R-410A) and R-134a.|$|E

50|$|ODP can be {{estimated}} from the molecular structure of a given substance. Chlorofluorocarbons have ODPs roughly equal to 1. Brominated substances have usually higher ODPs in range 5 - 15, because of more aggressive bromine reaction with ozone. Hydrochlorofluorocarbons have ODPs mostly in range 0.005 - 0.2 due {{to the presence of}} the hydrogen which causes them to react readily in the troposphere, therefore reducing their chance to reach the stratosphere where the ozone layer is present. <b>Hydrofluorocarbons</b> (<b>HFC)</b> have no chlorine content, so their ODP is essentially zero.|$|R
25|$|The hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) {{are less}} stable {{in the lower}} atmosphere, {{enabling}} them to break down before reaching the ozone layer. Nevertheless, a significant fraction of the HCFCs do break down in the stratosphere and they have contributed to more chlorine buildup there than originally predicted. Later alternatives lacking the chlorine, the <b>hydrofluorocarbons</b> (<b>HFCs)</b> have an even shorter lifetimes in the lower atmosphere. One of these compounds, HFC-134a, is now used in place of CFC-12 in automobile air conditioners. Hydrocarbon refrigerants (a propane/isobutane blend) are also used extensively in mobile air conditioning systems in Australia, the USA and many other countries, as they have excellent thermodynamic properties and perform particularly well in high ambient temperatures.|$|E

At {{the time of the}} agreement, these 76 countries were collectively responsible for 85% of annual global emissions.|$|E
50|$|The first {{air conditioners}} and {{refrigerators}} employed toxic or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, {{that could result}} in fatal accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon, in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or <b>hydrofluorocarbon</b> (<b>HFC)</b> refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).|$|R
5000|$|The carbon {{neutrality}} concept may {{be extended to}} include other greenhouse gases (GHG) {{measured in terms of}} their carbon dioxide equivalence (e) —the impact a GHG has on the atmosphere expressed in the equivalent amount of CO2. The term [...] "climate neutral" [...] reflects the broader inclusiveness of other greenhouse gases in climate change, even if CO2 is the most abundant, encompassing other greenhouse gases regulated by the Kyoto Protocol, namely: methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), <b>hydrofluorocarbons</b> (<b>HFC),</b> perfluorocarbons (PFC), and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). Both terms are used interchangeably throughout this article.|$|R
25|$|Along with CO2, methane and {{nitrous oxide}} are also major forcing {{contributors}} to the greenhouse effect. The Kyoto Protocol lists these together with <b>hydrofluorocarbon</b> (<b>HFCs),</b> perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), which are entirely artificial (i.e. anthropogenic) gases, which also contribute to radiative forcing in the atmosphere. The chart at right attributes anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions to eight main economic sectors, of which the largest contributors are power stations (many of which burn coal or other fossil fuels), industrial processes, transportation fuels (generally fossil fuels), and agricultural by-products (mainly methane from enteric fermentation and nitrous oxide from fertilizer use).|$|R

2500|$|A {{hydrocarbon}} refrigerant {{was developed}} at a German technological institute, and in 1992 {{came to the}} attention of the non-governmental organization (NGO) Greenpeace.

[...] In the U.S., however, change has been much slower. [...] To some extent, CFCs were being replaced by the less damaging hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), although concerns remain regarding HCFCs also. In some applications, <b>hydrofluorocarbons</b> (<b>HFCs)</b> were being used to replace CFCs. HFCs, which contain no chlorine or bromine, do not contribute at all to ozone depletion although they are potent greenhouse gases. The best known of these compounds is probably HFC-134a (R-134a), which in the United States has largely replaced CFC-12 (R-12) in automobile air conditioners. In laboratory analytics (a former [...] "essential" [...] use) the ozone depleting substances can be replaced with various other solvents. The development and promotion of an ozone-safe hydrocarbon refrigerant was a breakthrough which occurred after the initiative of a non-governmental organization (NGO). Civil society including especially NGOs, in fact, played critical roles at all stages of policy development leading up to the Vienna Conference, the Montreal Protocol, and in assessing compliance afterwards. The major companies claimed that no alternatives to HFC existed. [...] By 1992, the NGO Greenpeace had learned that a Hamburg technological institute in Germany had formulated an ozone-safe refrigerant. [...] The rights were donated to Greenpeace, who called the refrigerant [...] "Greenfreeze," [...] and left the patent as open source. [...] The NGO then worked successfully first with a small and struggling company to market an appliance beginning in Europe, then Asia and later Latin America, receiving a 1997 UNEP award. By 1995, Germany had already made CFC refrigerators illegal. Production spread to companies like Electrolux, Bosch, and LG, with sales reaching some 300 million refrigerators by 2008. [...] However, the giant corporations all continued to refuse to apply the technology in Latin America. [...] In 2003, a domestic Argentinian company began Greenfreeze production, while the giant Bosch in Brazil began a year later. [...] Chemical companies like Du Pont, whose representatives even disparaged the green technology as [...] "that German technology," [...] maneuvered the EPA to block the technology in the U.S. until 2011. [...] Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric, spurred by Greenpeace, had expressed formal interest in 2008 which figured in the EPA's final approval. Currently, more than 600 million refrigerators have been sold, making up more than 40 percent of the market.
