6000|$|My {{affection for}} my guest {{increases}} every day. He excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see so noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief? He is so gentle, yet so wise; {{his mind is}} so cultivated, and when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art, yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence. He is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck, apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interests himself deeply in the projects of others. He has frequently conversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without disguise. He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken to secure it. I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my enterprise. One man's life or death were but {{a small price to}} pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race. As I spoke, a dark gloom spread over my listener's countenance. At first I perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before his eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast. I paused; at length he spoke, in broken accents: [...] "Unhappy man! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>share</b> my madness? Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught?

40|$|Selling to the {{processing}} industry Cue: High value spice crops like vanilla and cardamom {{can be a}} tempting option for farmers wanting to earn more money. But growing these crops needs specialist knowledge and attention to detail, and farmers {{must be ready to}} invest in order to get their production started. One way {{to reduce the risk of}} failure is to have a contract with a buyer, such as a spice company, who can support in the production of the crop and be a guaranteed market. Uganda Crop Industry, for example, is a food processing company which contracts farmer groups to grow cardamom, a popular spice in Asian cooking. Ronald Kafeero is the chairman of one of these groups, and he spoke recently to Wambi Michael about how they grow and sell the spice. Before visiting Ronald, however, Wambi first met with Abdul Majidu, an extension worker with {{the processing}} company. He asked Abdul how many farmers supply their cardamom. IN:	?We have around 400 people ? OUT:	? have got that good example. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 08 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Ronald Kafeero, who grows cardamom for the Uganda Crop Industry. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Majidu	We have around 400 people. The people were just very much in contact. Michael	They finally sell the product to you? Majidu	Indeed. Michael	Now let?s start our motorcycle, we go and see these guys who grow cardamom. We are now going to see some of the farmers who grow cardamom in part of this area. SFX	Motorcycle engine. Michael	We are now in Lugazi. We are meeting one of the farmers here in Lugazi Good afternoon sir. Kafeero	Good afternoon. Michael	How are you? Kafeero	I?m alright, how are you sir? Michael	Fine, how is here? Kafeero	We are ok here. Michael	Now we are talking about the growing of cardamom and I can see we are standing next to this crop. When did you begin growing cardamom? Kafeero	I began growing cardamom in 2004. We have a group which is called Kyosimbonanya. We were trained to grow cardamom so I became a model farmer here and I?m benefiting from cardamom. Michael	And how many are you in the group? Kafeero	We are 18 members. Michael	Ok, how do you market this cardamom after growing? Kafeero	After growing cardamom, after picking it from the garden, we take it straight to the Uganda Crop Industry and get our money just immediately. Michael	Immediately? Because in the past we used to have scenarios where you would grow coffee then they wait for years to get their money. So with cardamom you grow it immediately and get it? Kafeero	Yeah, and get the money. Michael	Ok. Tell us how you market this product? Kafeero	Ok. Us in our group we just gather our cardamom, all of us here, so that we send it and sell it as a group, in Uganda Crop Industry. Michael	How good is that? Kafeero	That one is better because it takes a short time, takes a little time. One person can go, a person who we trust can go there, and the rest remain working in their farms, so that we don?t waste time. Michael	Now how do you ensure the quality of cardamom that you send to Uganda Crop Industries? Kafeero	That one, we were trained by some of our instructors. The best quality of cardamom we know and we just collect it, when it is about green. Michael	Now let?s talk again about this group marketing element. How are the farmers who are growing cardamom benefiting from selling of cardamom? Kafeero	We were suffering when we were selling it, this coffee, because we were selling just individually. But now as a group, our people have benefited very much because we gather our crop at my home here and we take it there to Uganda Crop Industry. Michael	How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>share</b> out what you have got in terms of sales? Kafeero	I have a weighing scale here. So every person who has brought his cardamom we have to know the exact kilos which we are just taking. So we gather it together, after getting the kilos of every individual, so that we send it there. Michael	And how good is this? Kafeero	That one is very good because it does not waste time and we are working together. So we are benefiting and we are advising the money which we get from there, we advise our farmers, do this one, do that one. Myself, I?m going to Kituza for more knowledge and I?ll be going to the other institute at Kampala there for more training because I have gathered enough money. Even some boda bodas, the boys are busy making money. Michael	You mean you bought motorcycles that you gave out to people? Kafeero	To people. Michael	Are you doing that also as a group, like a grouped people? Kafeero	Yes, we are doing it in Kyosimbonanya Farmers? Group, and already about ten of us we have boda bodas which are busy at the Lugazi town, who work there. Michael	In the past we had some farmers when they had the vanilla boom, people used to bring nails and whatever and they put in vanilla. So you as a group, how do you ensure quality of the cardamom? Kafeero	As we have learnt from our people with vanilla, they were spoiling their crop, whereby even there it had no market. So with us we ensure that we do something which is good so that it does not spoil our market, as it spoiled the market of those people with vanilla. We have got that good example.

40|$|Exploit {{your local}} {{resources}} Cue: Is organic farming only important for cash crops, {{or does it}} also {{have a role in}} improving food security? And can small-scale farmers establish organic production on their own, or will they always depend on support from outside agencies? To discuss these questions, Daniel Sikazwe invited two organic experts to his studio in Lusaka, Zambia. One, Mr. Malinga is an organic farmer, who sells his wide range of crops in local markets. The other, Patrick Killen, is an organic specialist with the crop buying agency, Agriflora. Daniel was interested to find out what small-scale farmers could achieve without external supports, and whether organic farming could be a good system for subsistence farmers, particularly during times of food crisis. He began by asking Mr. Malinga about the advantages of organic farming, in contrast to using chemical inputs, such as fertilizers. IN:		?You can do things without ? OUT:		? already hunger in his district. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 35 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Daniel Sikazwe, speaking to Mr. Malinga, an organic farmer, and Patrick Killen, an organic specialist with Agriflora. Transcript Malinga	You can do things without expecting somebody to bring you something from somewhere. You can do it within your locality. You don?t have to expect fertilizer to come from Europe, you just use what you have within the environment. Sikazwe	And {{how long have you been}} an organic farmer yourself? Malinga	I started organic farming in 1998. The rest of the years I was using conventional farming, of which I was using chemical fertilizers, and I found that I was just wasting my time by using chemical fertilizers in my field. Then I stopped it completely in 1990. Sikazwe	Do you think it is possible that, as a small-scale farmer, you can embark upon successful organic farming without much support from bigger companies? Malinga	Yes, because most of the things I am using, they are locally found. Except when we need irrigation, it is where the small scale farmers would like to have help. But the rest of the things you can?t, because you can do it yourself. Sikazwe	Well, Mr. Malinga, I want to find out how, as small-scale farmers, you share knowledge. What kind of knowledge <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>share,</b> what kind of techniques? Malinga	I always meet with my neighbours, and we teach each other how to make compost, how to control pests using local, like tephrosia, we use tephrosia leaves to spray our crops. Sikazwe	Do you have any hope that organic farming will always be there to support you, to support the community, or probably at some point, you might just want to get back to conventional farming? Malinga	I don?t think that I can go back to conventional farming, because it is expensive, and I cannot manage. I nearly failed when I was using conventional farming, but with the organic farming I cannot stop, and I cannot change. I will continue with my organic, because I have seen the benefits. As I am talking, I have enough food at my farm, compared to my neighbours who are not practising organic farming, they are really starving. They did whatever they could do: they used fertilizers, they ploughed and they put Compound D, and they put urea, but their crops didn?t grow. But for me the crops grow very well. Sikazwe	What are some of the crops that you have been growing? Malinga	I have been growing mainly legumes, like velvet beans is for a cover crop, sunnhemp, maize is a must. And I grow soya beans, cowpeas, pigeonpeas, and tephrosia, and the -what do you call it? Sikazwe	OK we will get back to it when you get it. I thought we could also look at this question about whether organic farming is only possible for farmers that might have a ready market, like those dealing with Agriflora, and probably exporting to western countries, or shall I say Europe. Whether there is any possibility really of organic farming being embarked upon for those that might just depend on it for the sake of food security? Killen	Well I think, yes it can be used in that capacity. I think Mr. Malinga is an example for the fact that organic farming is suitable. But I must say that from visiting his farm, he is very observant, the whole time thinking of ways of developing and moving further. And the farm there, I must admit that when I visited there I was shocked at how fertile it was looking. And he is growing also on a sandy soil, but his crops still came through on a sandy soil, which is very impressive. Sikazwe	At the moment there is this food crisis around southern Africa. Do you think organic farming could offer a solution to the food problems that we have at the moment? Killen	Yes, in part. Obviously the thing with organic farming is it is not instant farming. You take time to build up soil fertility. In Mr. Malinga?s case, he was growing conventionally and then slowly as he reduced the fertilizers he increased the beans and peas, the legumes that he introduced into his crop rotation. So after a while then, he was able to take out the fertilizers, and rely solely on legumes and compost etc, for his fertilization. He is managing quite well, and we were discussing on our way here, this year he has managed to get crops to feed himself, his family and his workers etc. His yields are quite good, and the neighbours who are practising agriculture, and a similar style of agriculture to him, have also got yields, whereas those who have used chemicals have struggled this year, and there is already hunger in his district.
