5|$|Although Athenian {{women were}} not legally {{permitted}} to dispose of large sums of money, they frequently had large dowries which supported them throughout their lives. Income from a <b>dowry</b> could be significant. The larger a woman's <b>dowry</b> relative to her husband's wealth, the more influence she was likely {{to have in the}} household since she retained the <b>dowry</b> if the couple divorced. Athenian women could also acquire property by inheritance if they were the closest surviving relative, but could not contractually acquire or dispose of property.|$|E
5|$|Only in {{exceptional}} circumstances would {{there have been no}} <b>dowry,</b> since the lack of one could have been interpreted as proof that no legitimate marriage occurred. A <b>dowry</b> may have been occasionally overlooked if a bride's family connections were very favorable; Callias reportedly married Elpinice, a daughter of the noble Philaidae, to join that family and was sufficiently wealthy that her lack of a <b>dowry</b> did not concern him.|$|E
5|$|Marriage most {{commonly}} involved a betrothal (engue), before the bride was {{given over to}} her new husband and kyrios (ekdosis). A less common form of marriage, practised {{in the case of}} epikleroi, required a court judgement (epidikasia). Athenian women married with a <b>dowry,</b> which was intended to provide their livelihood. Depending on the family, a <b>dowry</b> might have been as much as 25 percent of the family's wealth. Daughters of even the poorest families apparently had dowries worth ten minae. Rich families could provide much larger dowries; Demosthenes' sister, for instance, had a <b>dowry</b> of two talents (120 minae). Dowries usually consisted of movable goods and cash, although land was occasionally included.|$|E
50|$|Providing <b>dowries</b> {{for poor}} women was {{regarded}} as a form of charity by wealthier parishioners. The custom of Christmas stockings springs from a legend of St. Nicholas, in which he threw gold in the stockings of three poor sisters, thus providing for their <b>dowries.</b> St. Elizabeth of Portugal and St. Martin de Porres were particularly noted for providing such <b>dowries,</b> and the Archconfraternity of the Annunciation, a Roman charity dedicated to providing <b>dowries,</b> received the entire estate of Pope Urban VII.|$|R
50|$|Robert {{ended the}} {{practice}} of giving away parts of the Burgundian estate to younger sons and as <b>dowries</b> to the daughters. From then on, the whole duchy, however already diminished by earlier <b>dowries,</b> passed unfragmented to the eldest son.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a letter}} to Bishop Lancelot Andrews, Bacon spoke of his {{juridical}} works as being a thoughtful action aiming the general good of men in society and the <b>dowries</b> of government, saying that [...] "having {{in the work of}} mine Instauration had in contemplation the general good of men in their very being, and the <b>dowries</b> of nature; and in my work of laws, the general good of men likewise in society, and the <b>dowries</b> of government; I thought in duty I owed somewhat unto my own country, which I ever loved".|$|R
5|$|Neerja {{reflects}} on her brief, unhappy arranged marriage to Naresh (Kavi Shastri), a professional in Doha, Qatar, who abused her over her small <b>dowry</b> and inability to perform household work. She eventually returned {{home for a}} modeling contract. Naresh sent her parents a letter complaining about the <b>dowry</b> and their daughter's lack of domestic skills, demanding that Neerja either bring back money or not return at all. Neerja left Naresh and landed a job with Pan Am Airways.|$|E
5|$|Periyar {{fought against}} the {{orthodox}} traditions of marriage as suppression of women in Tamil Nadu and throughout the Indian sub-continent. Though arranged marriages were meant to enable a couple to live together throughout life, it was manipulated to enslave women. Much worse was the practice of child marriages practised throughout India at the time. It was believed {{that it would be}} a sin to marry after puberty. Another practice, which is prevalent today, is the <b>dowry</b> system where the bride's family is supposed to give the husband a huge payment for the bride. The purpose of this was to assist the newly wedded couple financially, but in many instances dowries were misused by bridegrooms. The outcome of this abuse turned to the exploitation of the bride's parents wealth, and in certain circumstances, lead to <b>dowry</b> deaths. There have been hundreds of thousands of cases where wives have been murdered, mutilated, and burned alive because the father of the bride was unable to make the <b>dowry</b> payment to the husband. Periyar fiercely stood up against this abuse meted out against women.|$|E

They have invaded police stations to demand that police investigate these matters, {{and other things that}} affect the community such as corruption. India’s police are notoriously corrupt and sometimes only the threat of a full-scale female riot will get them to act.|$|E

5|$|The {{preference}} for sons over daughters in India {{is rooted in}} social, economic and religious reasons. Women are often believed to be of a lower value in society due to their non-breadwinner status. Financial support, old age security, property inheritance, <b>dowry</b> and beliefs surrounding religious duties all contribute to the preference of sons over daughters. One {{of the main reasons}} behind the preference of sons is the potential burden of having to find grooms for daughters. Families of women in India often have to pay a <b>dowry</b> and all expenses related to marriage in order to marry off a daughter, which increases the cost associated with having a daughter.|$|E
5|$|He {{passed laws}} to protect prostitutes from {{exploitation}} {{and women from}} being forced into prostitution. Rapists were treated severely. Further, by his policies: women charged with major crimes should be guarded by other women to prevent sexual abuse; if a woman was widowed, her <b>dowry</b> should be returned; and a husband could not take on a major debt without his wife giving her consent twice.|$|E
5|$|However, Balfas {{writes that}} it is unjust to {{consider}} Sitti Nurbaya as only another forced marriage story, as the marriage of Nurbaya and Samsu would have been accepted by society.

Philip threatened to invade Normandy if this did not happen. He also reopened the question of the Vexin which had formed part of Margaret's <b>dowry</b> several years before; Henry still occupied the region and now Philip insisted that the King either complete the long agreed Richard-Alice marriage, or return Margaret's <b>dowry.</b> Philip invaded the Berry and Henry mobilised a large army which confronted the French at Châteauroux, before papal intervention brought a truce. During the negotiations, however, Philip suggested to Richard that he should ally with the French king against Henry, marking {{the start of a new}} strategy to divide the father and son.|$|E

5|$|Oddr Snorrason has an {{elaborate}} {{account of the}} problems arising from Thyri's marriages. He tells us that she was betrothed and married to the Wendish king Burislav, who received a large <b>dowry</b> for her; {{but she did not}} want to be his wife and starved herself after their wedding, so Burislav sent her back to Denmark. She then arranged to have herself married to Olaf Tryggvason, to the displeasure of her brother Svein. Svein's queen, Sigrid the Haughty, a staunch opponent of Olaf, egged Svein to make war on him. Svein then conspired with Jarl Sigvaldi and King Olaf of Sweden to lure Olaf Tryggvason into a trap. Olaf Tryggvason travelled to Wendland to collect Thyri's <b>dowry</b> from King Burislav and while there heard rumours of a planned ambush; but Sigvaldi arrived to tell him these rumours were false. Believing Sigvaldi, Olaf sent most of his fleet home, as his men were impatient. He therefore had only a small fleet left when he was ambushed near Svolder.|$|E

5|$|Taking {{as a wife}} an epikleros who {{had little}} estate was {{considered}} a praiseworthy action, and was generally stressed in public speeches. Such an heiress was called an epikleros thessa. If the nearest male relative {{did not wish to}} marry an epikleros who belonged to the lowest income class in Athens, he was required to find her a husband and provide her with a <b>dowry</b> on a graduated scale according to his own income class. This <b>dowry</b> was in addition to her own property and the requirement was designed to ensure that even poor heiresses found husbands. The law also did not stipulate what was to happen if the epikleros was still an infant or too young for consummation of the marriage when she was claimed.|$|E

5|$|With William dead, Henry's {{alliance}} with Anjou– {{which had been}} based on his son marrying Fulk's daughter– began to disintegrate. Fulk returned from the Levant and demanded that Henry return Matilda and her <b>dowry,</b> a range of estates and fortifications in Maine. Matilda left for Anjou, but Henry argued that the <b>dowry</b> had in fact originally belonged to him before it came into the possession of Fulk, and so declined to hand the estates back to Anjou. Fulk married his daughter Sibylla to William Clito, and granted them Maine. Once again, conflict broke out, as Amaury de Montfort allied himself with Fulk and led a revolt along the Norman-Anjou border in 1123. Amaury was joined by several other Norman barons, headed by Waleran de Beaumont, one of the sons of Henry's old ally, Robert of Meulan.|$|E
