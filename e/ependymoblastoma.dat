50|$|About 10% of {{ependymoma}}s are benign myxopapillary ependymoma (MPE). MPE is a localized {{and slowly}} growing, low-grade tumor. Although some ependymomas {{are of a}} more anaplastic and malignant type, {{most of them are}} not anaplastic. Well-differentiated ependymomas are usually treated with surgery. For other ependymomas, total surgical removal is the preferred treatment in addition to radiation therapy. The malignant (anaplastic) varieties of this tumor, malignant ependymoma and the <b>ependymoblastoma,</b> are treated similarly to medulloblastoma but the prognosis is much less favorable. Malignant ependymomas may be treated with a combination of radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Ependymoblastomas, which occur in infants and children younger than 5 years of age, may spread through the cerebrospinal fluid and usually require radiation therapy. The subependymoma, a variant of the ependymoma, is apt to arise in the fourth ventricle but may occur in the septum pellucidum and the cervical spinal cord. It usually affects people over 40 years of age and more often affects men than women.|$|E

40|$|The {{expression}} of N-glycolylneuraminic acid forming {{the structure of}} gangliosides and/or other glycoconjugates (Hanganutziu-Deicher antigen) in human has been considered as a tumor-associated antigen. Specifically, some reports of 14 F 7 Mab (a highly specific Mab raised against N-glycolyl GM 3 ganglioside) reactivity in human tumors have been recently published. Nevertheless, tumors of epithelial origin have been mostly evaluated. The goal of the present paper was to evaluate the immunohistochemical recognition of 14 F 7 Mab in different human tumors of neuroectodermal, mesodermal, and epithelial origins using an immunoperoxidase staining method. Samples of fetal, normal, and reactive astrocytosis of the brain were {{also included in the}} study. In general, nontumoral tissues, as well as, low-grade brain tumors showed no or a limited immunoreaction with 14 F 7 Mab. Nevertheless, high-grade astrocytomas (III-IV) and neuroblastomas, as well as, sarcomas and thyroid carcinomas were mostly reactive with 14 F 7. No reaction was evidenced in medulloblastomas and <b>ependymoblastomas.</b> Our data suggest that the {{expression of}} N-glycolyl GM 3 ganglioside could be related to the aggressive behavior of malignant cells, without depending on the tumor origin.

The specific activity of β-glucuronidase (lysosomal enzyme) was twice that of the whole homogenate, the specific activity of arylesterase (microsomal enzyme) was {{similar to that of the}} whole homogenate and succinate dehydrogenase (mitochondrial marker) was not detected. Electron microscopy of this fraction showed vesicles on which 5 '-nucleotidase activity could be demonstrated.

Median age at diagnosis was 3. 5 years (range, 1. 8 - 5. 6 years), and the median follow-up of survivors was 5. 9 years (range, 2. 2 - 12. 7 years). Initial stage was M 0 in 9, and M 0 / 1 (no cerebrospinal fluid examination done) in 2 patients. Gross-total tumor resection was achieved in 7 patients, incomplete resection in 4 patients. Further primary therapy included chemotherapy in all patients, craniospinal radiotherapy in 5 patients and high-dose chemotherapy in 2 patients. Tumor response to chemotherapy was observed in 1 of 4 evaluable patients. Tumor progression occurred in 7 patients after a median time of 5. 0 months (range, 2. 5 - 19. 2 months). Five-year progression-free survival was 36. 4 % (± 14. 5 %), 5 -year overall survival 30. 3 % (± 15. 9 %).

The radioactivity measured in <b>ependymoblastoma</b> 1, 6, 14, and 25 hr after i. m. Injection of 10. 4 μCi of 1 -(2 -chloroethyl) - 3 -[cyc/o/?exy/- 1 - 14 CJcyclohexyl- 1 -nitrosourea per mouse was significantly higher (p < 0. 001) in the tumors of animals treated with AMB (25 mg/kg 10 hr prior to [14 C]CCNU) as compared to controls. The effects of AMB and CCNU given separately or in combination on RNA and protein synthesis were studied by measuring the incorporation of [3 H]uridine and [14 C]leucine, respectively, into RNA and proteins. The administration of AMB (25 mg/kg) or CCNU (10 mg/kg) did not affect the incorporation of [3 H]uridine measured 2 hr after the i. p. injection of 40 μCi of labeled precursor per mouse. On the other hand, the incorporation of [3 H]uridine was significantly (ρ < 0. 001) inhibited in animals treated with AMB (25 mg/kg) followed 10 hr later by CCNU (10 mg/kg), as compared to animals receiving CCNU alone. The inhibition, which reached a maximum of about 35 % 24 hr after the administration of CCNU, was not observed when AMB was given after CCNU. The inhibition of RNA synthesis was also observed in mice treated with AMB and cyclohexyl isocyanate (5. 4 mg/kg), a degradation product of CCNU. Measurements of [14 C]leucine incorporation showed that AMB did not increase the inhibition of protein synthesis produced by CCNU. These observations suggest that AMB increases the uptake of a cyclohexyl derivative arising from the degradation of CCNU. The increased uptake of this compound results in inhibition of RNA synthesis. This mechanism could account for the potentiation of the CCNU therapeutic effect produced by AMB, at least in murine <b>ependymoblastoma.</b> Downloaded from cancerres. aacrjournals. org on February 9, 2016. © 1980, American Association for Cancer Research.

40|$|Background: The {{primitive}} neuroectodermal tumours {{of central}} nervous system (CNS-PNET) are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms, occurring in the CNS and composed of undifferentiated or poorly differentiated neuroepithelial cells which may display divergent differentiation along neuronal, astrocytic and ependymal lines. The WHO classification includes in this group of tumours also ependymoblastomas and medulloepitheliomas. Several groups have reported examples of CNS-PNET with combined histological features of <b>ependymoblastoma</b> and neuroblastoma, defined as "embryonal tumour with abundant neuropil and true rosettes". The presence of the amplification of chromosome region 19 q 13. 42, common in both <b>ependymoblastoma</b> and embryonal tumour with abundant neuropil and true rosettes, suggests that they represent a histological spectrum of a single biological entity. Methods: We examined 24 cases of ependymoblastoma/embryonal tumour with abundant neuropil and true rosettes (EPBL/ETANTR) {{for the presence of}} mutations of TP 53 and β-Catenin and for amplification of c-myc/N-myc. Results: The SSCP-mutational screening did not identify any mutation in exons 5 to 8 of the TP 53 gene. However, we found a point mutation affecting codon 34 (GGA->GTA) of β-Catenin gene resulting in a Glycine -> Valine substitution. No cases presented c-myc/N-myc amplification. Conclusions: EPBL/ETANTRs show molecular features different from other CNS-PNET and medulloblastoma. The presence of alterations in the β-Catenin/WNT pathway seems to be noteworthy due to the close relationship between this pathway and miR- 520 g encoded in chromosome 19 q 13. 42 region amplified in these tumours...|$|E

The rate of 2 -month cures was 6 % when tumors were treated 10 to 12 days after transplantation {{by a single}} 6 i. m. injection of 2. 5 mg of CCNU per kg and reached 15 % with 10 mg of CCNU per kg. When 25 mg of AMB per kg were given i. p. 10 hr prior to CCNU, the respective figures increased to 18 and 58 %, the differences being significant at 5 and 1 %. A single dose of 25 mg of AMB per kg given alone did not affect tumor growth. Radioactivity per g of tumor was measured 30, 60, and 120 min after injection of [14 C]CCNU in total tissue, chloroform:methanol (2 : 1, v/v) extract, and CCNU isolated by thin-layer chromatography. No difference was found between animals treated with 25 mg of AMB per kg and controls. The inhibition of DNA synthesis, measured 24 hr after the administration of CCNU and 2 hr after the injection of [3 H]thymidine, was almost optimal with 5 mg of CCNU per kg. The inhibition caused by 1 mg of CCNU per kg was not enhanced by AMB. Thus, the potentiation of CCNU by AMB does not seem attributable to an increased permeability of the tumor to CCNU or to an enhancement of the inhibition of DNA synthesis, at least in murine <b>ependymoblastoma.</b> © 1976, American Association for Cancer Research.

40|$|BACKGROUND : Clinical and {{histological}} {{criteria for}} ependymoma prognosis are well recognized. Recently {{few studies have}} been done based on Immunohistochemistry for prognostication of these tumours. In this study we have correlated the histlogical spectrum with immmunoexpression of p 53 and Ki 67 in these tumors. AIMS : To know the incidence of ependymomas; study their morphological spectrum and to evaluate expression of P 53 and Ki 67 in diffferent morphological subtypes. MATERIAL AND METHOD : A retrospective sudy was preformed on 70 ependymomas received in a period between 1994 and 2001. Entire tissue received was processed for routine paraffin embedded H&E stained sections. Immunocytochemistry was performed using antibodies to GFAP, EMA, Pancytokeratin and synaptophysin, to differentiate papillary ependymoma from choroid plexus papilloma; clear cell ependymoma from oligodendroglioma and central neurocytoma; <b>ependymoblastoma</b> from other embryonal tumours. p 53 and Ki- 67 immunohistochemistry was performed to correlate their expression with various tumour grades and subtypes. RESULTS : There were 3 cases (4. 2 &#x 0025;) of Grade I ependymoma (2 cases of myxopapillary ependymoma and 1 case of subependymoma); 57 cases (81. 5 &#x 0025;) of ependymoma grade II (43 of these were of classical variety, 11 of clear cell ependymoma, 2 of papillary and 1 case of cellular ependymoma).

40|$|Otto Warburg first {{proposed}} that cancer originated from irreversible injury to mitochondrial respiration, but the structural {{basis for this}} injury has remained elusive. Cardiolipin (CL) is a complex phospholipid found almost exclusively in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is intimately involved in maintaining mitochondrial functionality and membrane integrity. Abnormalities in CL can impair mitochondrial function and bioenergetics.

Major abnormalities in CL content or composition were found in all tumors. The compositional abnormalities involved an abundance of immature molecular species and deficiencies of mature molecular species, suggesting major defects in CL synthesis and remodeling. The tumor CL abnormalities were also associated with significant reductions in both individual and linked electron transport chain activities.

40|$|Abstract. Since the {{appearance}} in 2000 of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification for {{central nervous system}} (CNS) neoplasms, numerous descriptions of new entities or variants {{have appeared in the}} literature. In the group of neuronal and mixed glioneuronal neoplasms are lesions with distinctive morphological features that are still not included in a precise classification, including extraventricular neurocytoma, papillary glioneuronal tumor, rosette-forming glioneuronal of the fourth ventricle, glioneuronal with neuropil-like rosette, and DNT-like tumor of the septum pellucidum. The glioneuronal tumor with neuropil-like rosette and oligodendroglioma with neurocytic differentiation represent morphological variants of genetically proven diffuse gliomas. The lipoastrocytoma and the pilomixoid astrocytoma enlarge the group of astrocytic lesions. Rare, low-grade gliomas of the spinal cord with extensive leptomeningeal dissemination associated with unusual neuroimaging are described. The chordoid glioma of the third ventricle and the papillary tumor of the pineal region seem to be correlated by a common histogenesis from the specialized ependyma of the subcommissural organ. An embryonal tumor with neuropil and true rosettes combining features of neuroblastoma and <b>ependymoblastoma</b> is discussed. These new, recently described lesions indicate that the complex morphologic spectrum of CNS tumors is far from being completely delineated...|$|E

These include embryonal tumor with abundant neuropil and true rosettes (ETANTR), <b>ependymoblastoma</b> (EBL), and medulloepithelioma (MEPL). In this study, we performed a comprehensive clinical, pathological, and molecular analysis of 97 cases of these rare brain neoplasms, including genome-wide DNA methylation and copy number profiling of 41 tumors. We identified uniform molecular signatures in all tumors irrespective of histological patterns, indicating that ETANTR, EBL, and MEPL comprise a single biological entity. As such, future WHO classification schemes should consider lumping these variants into a single diagnostic category, such as embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes (ETMR).

40|$|Embryonal tumor with {{abundant}} neuropil {{and true}} rosettes (ETANTR) is a recently described embryonal neoplasm {{of the central}} nervous system, consisting of a well‐circumscribed embryonal tumor of infancy with mixed features of <b>ependymoblastoma</b> (multilayer ependymoblastic rosettes and pseudorosettes) and neuroblastoma (neuroblastic rosettes) {{in the presence of}} neuropil‐like islands. We present the case of a young child with a very aggressive tumor that rapidly recurred after gross total resection, chemotherapy and radiation. Prominent vascular sclerosis and circumscribed tumor led to the diagnosis of malignant astroblastoma; however, rapid recurrence and progression of this large tumor after gross total resection prompted review of the original pathology. ETANTR is histologically distinct with focal glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) and synaptophysin expression in the presence of neuronal and ependymoblastic rosettes with focal neuropil islands. These architectural features, combined with unique chromosome 19 q 13. 42 amplification, confirmed the diagnosis. In this report, we describe tumor stem cell (TSC) marker CD 133, CD 15 and nestin alterations in ETANTR before and after chemotherapy. We found that TSC marker CD 133 was richly expressed after chemotherapy in recurrent ETANTR, while CD 15 is depleted compared with that expressed in the original tumor, suggesting that CD 133 + cells likely survived initial treatment, further contributing to formation of the recurrent tumor...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ependymoblastoma</b> (EBL) and {{embryonal}} tumor with abundant neuropil {{and true}} rosettes (ETANTR) are very aggressive embryonal neoplasms {{characterized by the}} presence of ependymoblastic multilayered rosettes typically occurring in children below 6 years of age. It has not been established whether these two tumors really comprise distinct entities. Earlier, using array-CGH, we identified a unique focal amplification at 19 q 13. 42 in a case of ETANTR. In the present study, we investigated this locus by fluorescence in situ hybridization in 41 tumors, which had morphologically been diagnosed as EBL or ETANTR. Strikingly, FISH analysis revealed 19 q 13. 42 amplifications in 37 / 40 samples (93 %). Among tumors harboring the amplification, 19 samples were identified as ETANTR and 18 as EBL. The three remaining tumors showed a polysomy of chromosome 19. Analysis of recurrent/metastatic tumors (n = 7) showed that the proportion of nuclei carrying the amplification was increased (up to 80 - 100 % of nuclei) in comparison to the corresponding primary tumors. In conclusion, we have identified a hallmark cytogenetic aberration occurring in virtually all embryonal brain tumors with ependymoblastic rosettes suggesting that ETANTR and EBL comprise a single biological entity. FISH analysis of the 19 q 13. 42 locus is a very promising diagnostic tool to identify a subset of primitive neuroectodermal tumors with distinct morphology, biology, and clinical behavior...|$|E
40|$|Embryonal {{neoplasms}} of {{the central}} nervous system (CNS) generally arise {{in the early years of}} life and behave in a clinically aggressive manner, but vary somewhat in their microscopic appearance. Several groups have reported examples of an embryonal tumor with combined histologic features of <b>ependymoblastoma</b> and neuroblastoma, a lesion referred to as "embryonal tumor with abundant neuropil and true rosettes" (ETANTR). Herein, we present 22 new cases, and additional clinical follow-up on our 7 initially reported cases, to better define the histologic features and clinical behavior of this distinctive neoplasm. It affects infants and arises most often in cerebral cortex, the cerebellum and brainstem being less frequent sites. Unlike other embryonal tumors of the CNS, girls are more commonly affected than boys. On neuroimaging, the tumors appear as large, demarcated, solid masses featuring patchy or no contrast enhancement. Five of our cases (18 %) were at least partly cystic. Distinctive microscopic features include a prominent background of mature neuropil punctuated by true rosettes formed of pseudo-stratified embryonal cells circumferentially disposed about a central lumen (true rosettes). Of the 25 cases with available follow-up, 19 patients have died, their median survival being 9 months. Performed on 2 cases, cytogenetic analysis revealed extra copies of chromosome 2 in both. We believe that the ETANTR represents a histologically distinctive form of CNS embryonal tumor. © 2009 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins...|$|E
40|$|The {{mitochondrial}} lipidome influences ETC (electron transport chain) {{and cellular}} bioenergetic efficiency. Brain tumours are largely dependent on glycolysis for energy due to defects in mitochondria and oxidative phosphorylation. In the present study, we used shotgun lipidomics {{to compare the}} lipidome in highly purified mitochondria isolated from normal brain, from brain tumour tissue, from cultured tumour cells and from non-tumorigenic astrocytes. The tumours included the CT- 2 A astrocytoma and an EPEN (<b>ependymoblastoma),</b> both syngeneic with the C 57 BL/ 6 J (B 6) mouse strain. The mitochondrial lipidome in cultured CT- 2 A and EPEN tumour cells were compared with those in cultured astrocytes and in solid tumours grown in vivo. Major {{differences were found between}} normal tissue and tumour tissue and between in vivo and in vitro growth environments for the content or composition of ethanolamine glycerophospholipids, phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin. The mitochondrial lipid abnormalities in solid tumours and in cultured cells were associated with reductions in multiple ETC activities, especially Complex I. The in vitro growth environment produced lipid and ETC abnormalities in cultured non-tumorigenic astrocytes that were similar to those associated with tumorigenicity. It appears that the culture environment obscures the boundaries of the Crabtree and the Warburg effects. These results indicate that in vitro growth environments can produce abnormalities in mitochondrial lipids and ETC activities, thus contributing to a dependency on glycolysis for ATP production...|$|E
30|$|The {{discovery}} that rapamycin was an immunosuppressant {{might not have}} led to testing its potential as a viable tumor suppressor {{if it were not}} for the research of Dr. Suren Sehgal at Ayerst Research Laboratories, Montreal, where rapamycin was isolated in 1972. Intuitively one would have thought that an immunosuppressive compound would prevent an immune response against tumor cells and therefore would not be a likely anticancer drug. But Dr. Sehgal observed that this compound appeared to possess novel properties beyond its immunosuppressive activities [8]. He sent a sample of rapamycin to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Developmental Therapeutics Program and requested anti-tumor activity screening. As a standard screening protocol, NCI initially tested compounds for growth inhibition against a limited number of human tumor cell lines. If the compound showed inhibition against one of more of these cell lines, it would be further tested for growth inhibition or killing of one or more of the NCI standard 60 human tumor cell lines with varying concentrations of the compounds. Approximately 2 % of the 2500 compounds tested annually proceed to the next stages of in vivo tests in xenographs in mice. Against the 60 tumor cell line panel, rapamycin was found to inhibit the growth of a number of tumor cell lines including mammary, colon 26, B 16 43 melanocarcinma, and EM <b>ependymoblastoma</b> [9]. Based on these test results, NCI advanced rapamycin as a priority drug.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Congenital {{brain tumors}} are very rare. We review these tumors in {{patients}} younger than 2 months diagnosed in our Department. Material & Methods: Seven congenital brain tumors were diagnosed during five years. Clinical and radiological findings and prognosis are analyzed. Findings: The study included 5 female and two male infants. Two cases were diagnosed antenatally {{by means of}} ultrasonography. All patients presented with intracranial hypertension. The tumor was non-homogenous with cystic and solid components in all neuroimaging, except for the case with choroid plexus papilloma. Hydrocephalus was evident in all of them. Most findings were infra-tentorial lesions. There were three teratomas, one primitive neuro-ectodermal tumor, one <b>ependymoblastoma</b> and one choroid plexus papilloma. Six patients were operated on, with one intra-operative death. Two passed away postoperatively with aspiration pneumonia. One patient died due to complications of chemotherapy and another one due to tumor recurrence one year after surgery. Only the patient with choroid plexus papilloma is alive after 2 years. Conclusion: Today, the availability of noninvasive imaging procedures such as computerized tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging has improved the diagnosis of congenital brain tumors. Inspite of development in prenatal diagnosis, appropriate pre and post operative management, the mortality associated with these tumors still remains high. The final prognosis in these patients is still discouraging despite early surgery and operative and anesthetic improvements. Choroid plexus papilloma accompanies the best prognosis, whereas teratoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumors have the worst prognosis...|$|E
40|$|Immunization of a BALB/c mouse with {{cells from}} the human {{neuroblastoma}} line LAN- 1 and fusion of the spleen cells with mouse myeloma cells, NS- 1, led {{to the production of}} a monoclonal antibody (Mab) with a rather unique reactivity for neuroblastoma. This Mab, named 5 A 7, detects an antigen of an apparent molecular weight of 65, 000 - 67, 000, localized mainly in the cytoplasm and released into culture medium, as revealed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments. By immunoperoxidase staining using a biotin-avidin technique, Mab 5 A 7 demonstrates a restrictive staining for neuroblastoma cell lines. Following extensive testing on freshly frozen specimens of neuroblastoma and other tumors, Mab 5 A 7 shows a highly selective reactivity for neuroblastomas (13 of 14) and some cells of one primitive neuroectodermal tumor (<b>ependymoblastoma).</b> No reactivity could be detected with Mab 5 A 7 on the 57 other tumor tissues tested. Among the normal fetal or adult tissue specimens tested, positive staining is found only on adult brain, colonic crypts, some renal tubules, and fetal medulla of the adrenal gland. Among bone marrow specimens tested, only those infiltrated by neuroblastoma cells gave a positive staining. Normal or malignant hematopoietic cells showed no reactivity with Mab 5 A 7. Our results with Mab 5 A 7 suggest that this reagent not only provides a valuable probe for the immunohistological diagnosis of neuroblastoma on fresh tumor specimens but also allows the detection of bone marrow infiltration by neuroblastoma cells...|$|E
