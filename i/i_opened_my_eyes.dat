500|$|Not {{only did}} the horse survive near-death in 2008, so did Kathy Ritvo, who had a heart {{transplant}} in November 2008. She was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy in 2001, limiting her horse training career. [...] By 2008 her condition deteriorated {{to the point where}} she was hospitalized for several months, and she was near death when an organ became available. [...] Less than six months after transplant surgery, she returned to training race horses. [...] In a 2011 interview, she compared her own rapid recovery to the spontaneous recovery of the horse as a foal, and stated, [...] "from the moment <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> , I felt fantastic. He's Mucho Macho Man and I'm Macho Woman." ...|$|E
500|$|Thunderball was {{the third}} James Bond score {{composed}} by John Barry, after From Russia with Love and Goldfinger. The original title song was entitled [...] "Mr. Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang", taken from an Italian journalist who in 1962 dubbed agent 007 as Mr. Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang. The title theme was written by Barry and Leslie Bricusse; the song was originally recorded by Shirley Bassey, and later rerecorded by Dionne Warwick, whose version was not released until the 1990s. The song {{was removed from the}} title credits after producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman were worried that a theme song to a James Bond film would not work well if the song did not have the title of the film in its lyrics. Barry then teamed up with lyricist Don Black and wrote [...] "Thunderball", which was sung by Tom Jones, who according to Bond production legend, fainted in the recording booth when singing the song's final note. Jones said of it, [...] "I closed my eyes and I held the note for so long when <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> the room was spinning." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2010, {{starting}} {{horses in}} 53 races for the year, she also {{took over the}} training of then-two-year-old Mucho Macho Man when her husband Tim stopped training horses because he began working {{as part of the}} management at Gulfstream Park. [...] Working with owners Reeves Thoroughbred Racing, the horse ran in the 2011 Kentucky Derby. Ritvo was only the 14th woman to train a horse entered in the Kentucky Derby in the 137 years it had been run to that date, and the third-place finish of the horse was the best for a woman trainer {{in the history of the}} race. [...] She kept her perspective: [...] "I'm so proud to be in the Derby, but just to get up in the morning is amazing." [...] She next ran Mucho Macho Man in the other two legs of the Triple Crown, the 136th Preakness Stakes and the 143rd Belmont Stakes, where he finished sixth and seventh respectively. Only 13 women trainers had saddled a starter prior to the 2011 Preakness, and Ritvo was only the 10th woman trainer to start a horse in the Belmont. [...] Mucho Macho Man had overcome his own health problems in order to race, including having appeared to be lifeless at birth. Comparing her own experiences to the horse, Ritvo stated, [...] "From the moment <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> I felt fantastic. He's Mucho Macho Man and I'm Macho Woman." ...|$|E

D'Or described an experience that he had singing at the festival as follows: [...] "I had a concert in the Canary Islands...in the WOMAD Festival in front of something like 20,000 people, and then I saw {{just in front of}} me, a group of Palestinian young people with a huge Palestinian flag. And at the beginning I was very tense because I didn't know what their intentions were. I closed my eyes and said 'Look, you speak always about the power of music and how music can get people close to each other', and I was like aiming to their heart, and I'm singing especially for them, and then when <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and I saw those people dancing with the Palestinian flag and singing with me together, and it was for me like an amazing sight, because this is something that I don't think ever happened before. I don't know why this world...is choosing...always...war and hate, because things are much easier to solve if you just want to solve them, that's what I feel.
