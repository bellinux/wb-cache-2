25|$|On October 14, 2011, Uchimura won the {{all-around}} final for the 3rd {{time at the}} 2011 World Championships in Tokyo, Japan. With a {{score of}} 93.631 points, Uchimura won {{by a margin of}} 3.101 points, roughly the same margin that separated 2nd and 14th place. Not only <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>the</b> first male gymnast to win three all-around titles, but he is also the first gymnast, male or female, to win three consecutive all-around titles. During the all around final, Uchimura recorded the highest score on four of the six events: floor exercise, still rings, parallel bars, and pommel horse (he tied for the highest score on pommel horse). Uchimura also qualified for five of the six individual apparatus finals (all except vault). He won his first world championship event gold medal on floor exercise as well as a bronze medal on high bar and the silver medal with the Japanese team.|$|E

In an interview with poet Alexandru Antemireanu, he explained his conflict with Caion in paternalistic terms: [...] "They did well not to sentence the kid. <b>Is</b> <b>he</b> <b>the</b> guilty party? No! Caion is merely a victim. Say I were a juror: why would I be setting an example by punishing this unreasonable and irresponsible kid, {{for those who are}} more mature and better placed, and who employ the same means as he did?" [...] The general public was by then firmly on Caragiale's side, and Macedonski's reputation suffered greatly as a result, increasing his isolation on the literary scene.|$|E

2500|$|However, the {{respective}} divinities {{do not have}} a common primary attribute: While the RigVedic Aryaman is apparently the [...] " [...] hospitality," [...] Avestan Airyaman is unambiguously a divinity of healing.

2500|$|... "Adir Hu" [...] (Mighty is He): a hymn {{naming the}} virtues of God in order of the Hebrew alphabet, expressing hope that God will rebuild the Holy Temple speedily.

2500|$|A compatibilist {{interpretation}} of Aquinas's view is defended thus: [...] "Free-will {{is the cause}} of its own movement, because by his free-will man moves himself to act. But it does not of necessity belong to liberty that what is free should be the first cause of itself, as neither for one thing to be cause of another need it be the first cause.

And just as by moving natural causes He does not prevent their acts being natural, so by moving voluntary causes He does not deprive their actions of being voluntary: but rather <b>is</b> <b>He</b> <b>the</b> cause of this very thing in them; for He operates in each thing according to its own nature." ...|$|E
