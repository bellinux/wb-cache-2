5|$|Therefore, {{the parish}} was {{in desperate need}} of a new rectory and the new project was begun in 1944. An engineer, Frank H. Recco, was the {{technical}} advisor of the project. Parishioners borrowed a bulldozer from the John F. Casey Company in Aspinwall, and a steam shovel from the Burrell Construction and Supply Company of New Kensington; and they <b>dug</b> <b>the</b> foundation for a two-level building.|$|E
5|$|On August 30, the British made a {{surprise}} breakout from the Boston Neck, {{set fire to}} a tavern, and withdrew to their defenses. On the same night, 300 Americans attacked Lighthouse Island and burned the lighthouse, killing several British soldiers and capturing 23 {{at the loss of}} one life. On another August night, Washington sent 1,200 men to dig entrenchments on a hill near the Charlestown Neck. Despite a British bombardment, the Americans successfully <b>dug</b> <b>the</b> trenches.|$|E

5|$|Scully and Doggett {{join the}} {{investigation}} at McKesson’s home. Scully suggests {{a connection between}} the burned body of Ariel McKesson who disappeared in 1956 and her mother, the latest victim. Scully believes that the burned body should be exhumed to potentially learn the connection with the other deaths. Later, the gravediggers already have the coffin excavated when Detective Abbott shows up at the town cemetery. They tell him {{that they did not have}} to dig because somebody already <b>dug</b> <b>the</b> coffin up and scratched the lid up. While they drive off with the body, Abbott inspects a dead tree. The creature is within and it eviscerates Abbott.|$|E
5|$|Beginning around 1238, {{the castle}} was {{expanded}} to the east, north, and north-west. The work lasted through {{the reign of}} HenryIII and into that of EdwardI, interrupted occasionally by civil unrest. New creations included a new defensive perimeter, studded with towers, while on the west, north, and east sides, where the wall was not defended by the river, a defensive ditch was <b>dug.</b> <b>The</b> eastern extension took the castle {{beyond the bounds of}} the old Roman settlement, marked by the city wall which had been incorporated into the castle's defences. The Tower had long been a symbol of oppression, despised by Londoners, and Henry's building programme was unpopular. So when the gatehouse collapsed in 1240, the locals celebrated the setback. The expansion caused disruption locally and £166 was paid to St Katherine's Hospital and the prior of Holy Trinity in compensation.|$|E
5|$|In the Holy Roman Empire (and {{elsewhere}} in Central/Eastern Europe), women who killed their newborn could be {{liable to be}} placed in an open grave, and have a stake hammered into their heart. A detailed description of an execution in this manner comes from 17th century Košice (then in Hungary, now in eastern Slovakia). A woman to be executed for infanticide involved an executioner and two assistants to help him. First, a grave some one-and-a-half ell deep was <b>dug.</b> <b>The</b> woman was placed within it, her hands and feet secured by driving nails through them. The executioner placed a small thorn bush upon her face. He then placed, and held vertically, a wooden stave at her heart to mark its location, while his assistants piled earth on the woman, keeping her head free of earth {{at the behest of the}} clerics, however, as to do otherwise would have quickened the death process. Once the earth had been piled upon her, the executioner grabbed with a pair of tongs a rod made of iron, which had been made red hot. He positioned the glowing iron rod beside the wooden stave, and as one of his assistants hammered the rod in, the other assistant emptied a trough of earth upon the woman's head. It is said that a scream was heard, and that the earth actually moved upwards for a moment, before all was over.|$|E
50|$|In 1739, French colonists and militia built Fort Assumption here. In the Civil War it was {{the site}} of Confederate Fort Pickering. For the use as a fort, <b>the</b> Confederates <b>dug</b> out <b>the</b> top of the mound and placed {{artillery}} there. An ammunition bunker was <b>dug</b> into <b>the</b> side of the mound.|$|R

5|$|In July 1940, the 2nd New Zealand Division {{was sent}} to Mersa Matruh. The cavalry regiment, camped at Garawla, <b>dug</b> <b>the</b> outer {{anti-tank}} ditch along the Wadi Naghamish (later known as the Kiwi Canal). That month, volunteers from the regiment joined the Long Range Desert Patrol, and the regiment's base came under air attack. In the pre-dawn darkness of 15 July, Italian bombers attempting to bomb the NAAFI dump were driven off by anti-aircraft fire from the regiment. During the night of 18 July, regimental anti-aircraft guns mistakenly fired on a damaged Bristol Blenheim. The regiment received orders to move to Baggush and build fortifications, completing the move on 1 September; the following day, it began constructing defences at Maaten Baggush. After finishing the task within a week, it {{was transferred to the}} rear area at El Daba. The regiment defended No.2 sector of the Baggush Box. After Operation Compass, the Allied offensive against Italian positions in Egypt and Libya, began on 9 December, several Italian Fiat M11/39 tanks were left behind at Nibeiwa. The regiment was ordered to salvage the tanks and on 15 December, Lieutenant H. A. Robinson led a party of 25 other ranks to Nibeiwa for the task. Div Cav received Marmon-Herrington Armoured Cars, replacing its obsolete Light Tanks Mk II and Mk III, and was transferred to Helwan in January 1941. The mortally ill Pierce was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Hugh Carruth on 22 February and C Squadron joined the regiment at Helwan on 5 March.|$|E

25|$|During that time, the British Government {{officials}} {{and many other}} adventurers <b>dug</b> <b>the</b> Royal Tombs or Maidams of Ahom kings in Charaideo, in search of treasures, as it was widely known that the material properties of the dead king, like swords, furniture, utensils, gold and silver jewellary, and other valuables were also entombed along with the dead king in the Maidam. Purandar Singha, at first protested the desecration of his ancestors’ tombs, but finding it hopeless to appeal, {{in a bid to}} preserve the treasure; he himself dug many Royal Tombs and recovered a large booty of treasures. Fearing outburst and reactions from other princes of Ahom Dynasty, he spread the news that he had <b>dug</b> <b>the</b> ancestral tombs to recover their bones and other remains, to take them to Ganges, for spiritual and religious purpose.|$|E
25|$|Although Huntington was now {{assured of}} naval gunfire support, Camp McCalla was tactically unsound.

25|$|In 1858 James Miller Williams <b>dug</b> <b>the</b> first {{oil well}} in North America at Oil Springs, Ontario, {{preceding}} Edwin Drake who drilled {{the first one}} in the United States one year later. By 1870 Canada had 100 refineries in operation and was exporting oil to Europe. However, the oil fields of Ontario were shallow and small, and oil production peaked and started to decline around 1900. In contrast, oil production in the United States grew rapidly {{in the first part of}} the 20th century after huge discoveries were made in Texas, Oklahoma, California and elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|The first European {{settlement}} {{in what is}} now Mount Holly began in 1677, when Walter Reeves acquired land from the Lenape (Delaware) Native Americans living in the area. He constructed a dam on Rancocas Creek to channel water through a raceway to power a grist mill and saw mill. Edward Gaskill and his sons hand <b>dug</b> <b>the</b> mill race on their property between 1720 and 1723. After the mills were established, more settlers were attracted to the area and built houses and commercial buildings on High, Church, White, Mill, and Pine streets, including the Shinn Curtis Log House (1712). By 1800, over 250 dwellings had been built.|$|E
25|$|After the {{transfer}} of power from Denmark, the Court was first housed in the Old Penitentiary Building on Skólavörðustígur in Reykjavík. In 1949 it moved to the former court building on Lindargata. 1993 saw a competition to design a new home for the Court, which was won by Margrét Harðardóttir and Steve Christer of Studio Granda, Reykjavík. The Icelandic Minister of Justice <b>dug</b> <b>the</b> first spade of ground for the new Courthouse of the Supreme Court of Iceland at Arnarhóll on 15 July 1994, laid {{the cornerstone of the}} building on the Court’s 75th anniversary, 16 February 1995, and handed it over to the Court for use on 5 September 1996.|$|E
25|$|Being {{located on}} the site of an old brickyard, the {{architecture}} took advantage of the hillside and <b>dug</b> <b>the</b> venue deep into the hill. This also resulted in the venue having a highly asymmetric shape, with tall spectator stands on the one side and nearly none on the other. The arena had a capacity for 4,450 spectators, of which 3,078 could be seated. It also featured nine luxury suites. The asymmetrical shape and retrofitted roof gave the arena several undesirable traits. The construction of the roof contributed to poor ice quality. During its final years, it was also considered severely outdated. The stands were known to be steep, diminishing accessibility, complicating logistics and hampering even able-bodied spectators.|$|E
