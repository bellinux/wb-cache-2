That gained for his theory {{from the very first}} outset universal respect and a fair hearing. Herbert Spencer was known to be a philosopher: and the practical English nation mistrusts philosophers: those people probe too deep and soar too high for any sensible person to follow them in all their flights. Robert Chambers, the unknown author of 'Vestiges of Creation,' was a shallow sciolist; it was whispered abroad that he was even inaccurate and slovenly in his facts: and your scientific plodder detests the very shadow of minute inaccuracy, though it speak with the tongues of men and angels, and be bound up with all the grasp and power of a Newton or a Goethe. But Charles Darwin was a known personage, an F.R.S., a distinguished authority upon coral reefs and barnacles, a great geologist, a great biologist, a great observer and indefatigable collector. His book came into the public hands stamped with the imprimatur of official recognition. Darwin was the father of the infant theory; Lyell and Hooker stood for its sponsors. The world could not afford to despise its contents; they could not brand its author offhand as a clever dreamer or a foolish amateur, or consign him to the dreaded English limbo of the 'mere theorist.' ...|$|E

40|$|This paper draws {{attention}} to the spatial dimension of sustainability, where spatial self-defence {{is an important part of}} control over local assets that have to be preserved. It should be added that well-structured local networks constitute an important requirement for effective spatial self-defence. In the existing European Union, where the national infrastructure networks have been relatively developed, the formation of a single market called first for concentration of efforts on the overlapping or inter-regional backbone level of networks. In the area now acceding to the EU, it is important to note that this programme cannot be applied with unchanged priorities in regions still lacking appropriate local networks, where great attention needs devoting to internal networks. In the integration process, the transition countries have to understand the importance of a multilayered network and pay equal attention to every layer of the transport network. The other issue that has been criticized is the structure of the backbone network. While the development of the trans-European networks in western Europe was governed by internal considerations – the intention of connecting national networks, the starting point in the eastern half of Europe was the <b>external</b> <b>consideration</b> of extending Trans-European Networks (TEN) to the transition countries. Even the backbone elements of the Transport Infrastructure Needs Assessment (TINA) network, which enjoy priority today, still reflect this approach. The danger remains that the additions expressing the needs of candidate countries will become lost in the process. Turning to Hungary, the paper gives a brief account of how an overcentralized transport network developed over the last century and the process by which a new road-transport layer was being created. The country today faces a similar process, as the new layer is developed into the new structure. Nonetheless, the existing and emerging structure is mistaken. An effort to reorient the conception is being made by defining the networkdevelopment criteria for a long-term inter-regional road network offering a structure separate from the traditional network of trunk roads, by developing an open grid that ensures minimum disturbance from transit traffic...|$|E

From this follows the belief that to ask patent examiners to consider moral issues is a novel approach (3).

40|$|Consider {{the problem}} of {{selecting}} k items that maximize {{the value of a}} monotone submodular set function f, where f can be accessed using value queries. It is well known that polynomially many queries suffice in order to obtain an approximation ratio of 1 − 1 e. We consider a variation on this problem in which the value queries are required to be of uniform size: each queried set, like the desired solution itself, must contain k items. We show that polynomially many uniform size queries suffice in order to obtain an approximation ratio of 12, and that an approximation ratio of 1 +ϵ 2 requires a number of queries that is exponential in ϵk. For the interesting special case of coverage functions, we show that an approximation ratio strictly better than 12 is attainable with polynomially many uniform size queries. The ”uniform size ” requirement is motivated by situations in which a firm may offer a menu of exactly k items to its clients, where k is a parameter determined by <b>external</b> <b>considerations.</b> Performing a query corresponds to physically changing the identities of the items offered, and the reply to the query is deduced by observing the behavior of clients in response to the change. Queries that involve a number of items that differs from k may not be desirable due to these <b>external</b> <b>considerations.</b> In such situations it is natural to ask whether the same approximation ratios that can be guaranteed by general value queries can also be obtained by uniform size queries. ...|$|R

Essentially, the assumption that government intervention is required only when market incentives fail has dictated that public funding should be reallocated from technology transfer activities, and ‘productivity enhancing’ and ‘near market’ research, to ‘basic’ research, which affects a broader range of industries than just the food and agriculture industries, and to ‘public interest’ research on pressing problems of food safety and environmental protection.

After an introduction to Prigoginian thinking, I propose my main heuristic in assessing Prigogine's scientific work called symmetry breaking and semigroup selection.

For example, they often provide a single solution which is difficult to explain, or which can not be incrementally modified using secondary "soft" constrains that are difficult to encode within the optimization. In order to address these issues, we have developed a probabilistic optimization technique that allows the user to enter prior probability distributions (Gaussian) for the parameters to be optimized {{as well as for the}} constraints on the parameters. Our technique combines the prior distributions with the constraints using Bayes' rule. The algorithm produces not only a set of parameter values, but variances on these values and covariances showing the correlations between parameters. We have applied this method to the problem of planning a radiosurgical ablation of brain tumors. The radiation plan should maximize dose to tumor, minimize dose to surrounding areas, and provide an even distribution of dosage across the tumor. It also should be explainable to and modifiable by the expert physicians based on <b>external</b> <b>considerations.</b> We have compared the results of our method with the standard linear programming approach...|$|R

The effects of the timing of launch vehicle selection reached virtually every aspect of the Observatory's design and development.

Among the IPCC, ICAO, DEFRA, and BrighterPlanet calculation methods, the largest estimate may be up to 4. 5 {{times larger than the}} smallest. Such heterogeneity – and ambiguity over the true estimate – confuses the consumer, undermining the credibility of emissions estimates in general. Consequently, GHG emissions estimates do not currently appear {{on the front page of}} flight search-engine results. Even where there are differences between alternative flights’ emissions, this information is unavailable to consumers at the point of choice. When <b>external</b> <b>considerations</b> rule out alternative travel-modes, the relative ranking of flight options’ GHG emissions is sufficient to inform consumers’ decision making. Whereas widespread agreement on a gold standard remains elusive, the present study shows that the principal GHG emissions calculation methods produce consistent rankings within specific route-structure classes. Hence, for many consumers, the question of which calculation method to employ is largely irrelevant. But unless GHG emissions information is displayed at the point of decision, it cannot enter into consumers’ decision making.

The 1977 plan defined a “Prescribed Natural Fire” zone generally above 3, 048 m (10, 000 ft) where risks were considered low and fires would be monitored {{and allowed to}} burn; a moderate risk zone where fires {{would be allowed to}} burn only under a set indexed condition; and a high risk zone where all fires would be suppressed immediately. The Ouzel fire was ignited by lightning on August 19, 1978, in the low risk zone, and was monitored {{for more than a month}} before high winds caused it to threaten a community outside the park’s boundary. After the fire was controlled in October, a board of review was convened to investigate the circumstances surrounding the event.
