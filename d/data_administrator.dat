In this study, we hypothesised that pedigree generation data processes do not generally require the clinical expertise of genetic counsellors and that they could be successfully transferred to nonclinical data administrators. We made a pragmatic comparison of two processes of pedigree generation by different personnel from 14 consecutive family history questionnaires containing 88 living and decease affected individuals.

However, for medical data administrators and medical personnel or patients, the local database is trustworthy and the cloud service provider may not be trusted, so the use of outsourced database services will face many security threats, such as data loss, tampering, and leakage.|$|E

Taking medical remote medical monitoring as an example, wireless wearable medical monitoring has become possible. According to the requirement, people can test and transmit data through various sensors on the body, need to form a wireless network structure, and use smart sensors and send the data to get into the human body health, sports, and other conditions; to obtain what we want in medical data, through the wireless body in patients with physical layout domain network, the medical workers need various physiological parameters transmitted by wireless monitoring instrument, so that we can avoid the influence of the instrument line, solve the instrument’s influence on the patients’ activity space, and also lighten the load of the medical staff 24 -h monitoring patients and work data records can be complete and correct. In addition, the long-term monitoring status of wireless monitoring system plays a role in preventing disease during the accumulation of pathological data. For normal healthy people, health care can also be carried out through such a portable monitoring system. At the same time, in some specific groups of people, such as athletes, by monitoring the rhythm of the heart and the information such as temperature and speed strength, to prompt the control training intensity, athletes in the invisible monitoring system also have {{played an important role in}} health and fitness coach. With the maturity and development of technology, intelligent network will play an important role in life, medical, entertainment, military, and other fields and applications. According to our research, intelligent networks can be roughly divided into two categories: medical applications and non-medical applications. At present, more and more scholars and experts in the field of intelligent network research, with the need for more and more applications and limitations, the idea of intelligent network system, and architecture ideas put forward new requirements and challenges. And with the rapid popularization of cloud computing, more and more individuals and enterprise users choose to send their information to the cloud, for example, in medical, medical drug data, patient treatment records, and other sensitive data files, the storage of medical cloud can not only reduce the cost of medical data maintenance and backup, but can also provide high-quality data on-demand storage services for medical <b>data</b> <b>administrators</b> (medical <b>data</b> <b>administrators),</b> thereby reducing the burden of <b>data</b> <b>administrators</b> on the storage and maintenance of patient data. However, because the medical staff or patients and the medical cloud server is not in the same trust domain, the cloud may take the initiative to disclose the data information to unauthorized parties and may also be invaded to passively disclose user information. The medical cloud server is not trusted, but in order to be able to store patient data securely on it, the data must be encrypted before the medical patient’s personal data is outsourced. But then it becomes very difficult for medical <b>data</b> <b>administrators</b> to search for encrypted medical data in a medical server. There are a number of simple ways to do this, such as downloading all the encrypted medical data locally, decrypting all the medical data downloaded, and then searching for keywords in plaintext after decryption, which is simple; but for local storage and network bandwidth, as well as the user’s need for decryption and search to pay a huge computational overhead, the operation is extremely inconvenient. The patient or medical users must directly send the required medical file keys and the keywords used to locate the medical file to the medical cloud server to interpret the key, and then based on clear text information on medical data files to search, as we all know, not only the medical cloud server but also the cloud server is not completely trustworthy. By sending the key directly to the medical cloud server, the cloud server will be directly informed of the user’s personal information, which is tantamount to the user’s personal information published in the network, and there will be no privacy. For the medical cloud, which is now widely used, with the rapid development of its sharing and economy, and not only the medical cloud, but almost all cloud storage systems, like a double-edged sword, where the data stored are mostly related to the privacy of users, if these personal information is leaked, the consequences will affect the lives of these people and even their security, it will be unimaginable. In particular, medical <b>data</b> <b>administrators</b> upload <b>data</b> to the medical cloud, while other medical <b>data</b> <b>administrators,</b> patients, or visitors visit the medical cloud and search for keywords which will give unscrupulous people the opportunity to steal data to raise risk to the safety of medical data. Based on the many keyword searches nowadays, the index structure sk-lsh of Liu Yingfan and others has ensured the accuracy of the search, but it cannot be applied to the outsourcing ciphertext database scene, which makes it unsuitable for the medical cloud computing environment. Before that, Chai and others put forward a verifiable keyword search scheme. Only the accurate keyword search is supported, and the search scheme of fuzzy keyword based on cipher is proposed by Li et al.; although the search security is ensured to a great extent, it does not support the verifiable problem of keyword search.|$|R

This separation is artificial and increases the overall burden of managing such systems. We propose a new management layer that unifies data and storage management without any loss of control over either the data or the storage. The new management layer consists of three basic entities: data sets, which describe the data managed by the system, policies that specify rules for the management of data sets, and resource pools that represent storage {{that can be used to}} implement the policies for the data sets. Using data sets and policies, data administrators are able to directly manage their data, even though that requires them to indirectly manage the underlying storage infrastructure.
