5000|$|... #Caption: Traditional Grip. This is a {{good example}} of the ancient style that Moeller describes. Note the angle of the snare drum, which makes the {{traditional}} grip of the left hand necessary, since matched grip would be difficult to use. Also note the positioning of the right hand, which looks like the little <b>finger</b> <b>grip</b> (See Moeller's book for more information, as well as George B. Bruce).|$|E
50|$|Though Moeller {{recommended}} standing when practicing, {{he shows}} {{that some of}} his pupils, such as concert and jazz band members, opted for sitting. These facts show that Moeller allowed for two right hand grips in his lessons (his book shows a picture of him seated at a snare drum showing a right hand thumb fulcrum grip). In other words, the little <b>finger</b> <b>grip</b> was not the only grip Moeller recognized when working with his pupils.|$|E

The yangqin's tuning pins are set in parallel instead of a 90-degree angle down at the side. The mallets of the santur also differ from those of the yangqin - they are made of wood with <b>finger</b> <b>grip,</b> designed to let the players perform by gripping the two mallets between their fore and middle fingers. Both modern and earlier yangqin mallets did not include finger grips.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{the other}} compact F-series SLRs, the FA used a plastic top plate: {{fiberglass}} reinforced polycarbonate {{for the black}} bodies, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) for the chrome ones. The FA also used the ultra-fast, bearing-mounted, honeycomb-patterned, titanium-bladed shutter and through-the-lens (TTL) off-the-film (OTF) electronic flash automation of the FE2, but added a digital liquid crystal display (LCD) information panel at the top left of the viewfinder to indicate the readings of the built-in, open aperture, through-the-lens (TTL) light meter versus the actual camera settings. Depending on the set exposure mode, the LCD would display +/- over/underexposure markers, HI/LO out of metering range warnings, shutter speed and/or f-stop. Unfortunately, the LCD could not be illuminated in low ambient light situations. The FA also had a removable <b>finger</b> <b>grip,</b> {{similar to the one}} introduced on the Nikon FG, and an eyepiece blind. However, the FA's real claim to fame was the AMP meter.|$|E
40|$|The <b>finger</b> <b>grip</b> and {{the palm}} grip {{are the most}} common needle holder grips for hand suturing in surgery. The major {{advantages}} of the palm grip are an increased versatility and the possibility to apply controlled force. However, there is a risk for a potential loss of precision and uncontrolled movement of the needle when disengaging the ratchet mechanism of the palmed instrument. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a new needle holder, referred to as the Frimand needle holder (FNH), and evaluate surgeons' perception of it. It was designed to overcome the above-mentioned disadvantages, hence facilitating palm and <b>finger</b> <b>grip</b> suturing. Moreover, we evaluated suture precision and attitudes related to the use of the <b>finger</b> <b>grip</b> and the palm grip...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that numerical magnitude and specific finger movements processing interfere with each other. On the basis of these interactions, the present study investigated whether action observation was able to influence a random number generation task. This task required participants to randomly produce numbers between 1 and 10 after they observed action stimuli. Those stimuli were either closing or opening movements of fingers, hands or mouth, or a stimuli color change (a control comparison condition). The results revealed that random number production was influenced by the prior presentation of the <b>finger</b> <b>grip</b> movements, whereby observing a closing <b>finger</b> <b>grip</b> movement led participants to produce more small than large numbers, while observing an opening <b>finger</b> <b>grip</b> movement led participants to produce more large than small numbers. For the hand movement conditions, the influence on number production was less striking while the influence of the mouth movements was restricted to the opening movement with an overproduction of large numbers after this condition. Finally, stimuli color change conditions did not influence the number production task. Taken together, these results showed that some of the characteristics of the observed finger, hand and mouth grip movements appeared to automatically prime the number generation task. The findings are discussed in terms of the functional and neural mechanisms that might explain the effect, and support the view that number semantics might be grounded on sensory-motor mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the finger}} and hand force {{developments}} {{of the students who}} have taken selective/applied Tennis and Massage courses at the University have been examined. From the students of the Department of Physical Education and Sport, 19 healthy females and 73 healthy males (age = 21. 25 ± 1. 55 years (average ± SD) who have taken selective Tennis courses; 51 healthy males (age = 22. 00 ± 1. 04 years (average ± SD) who have taken Massage courses; and as the control group, 16 healthy womenand 50 healthy males(age = 21. 72 ± 1. 47 years (average ± SD) have been participated to the study. The age, length, body weight, grip strength of both hands as well as the <b>finger</b> <b>grip</b> strength of the subjects have been recorded. The course schedule has been set as once a week four hours practice for both tennis and massage. Two weeks of the education and training program that takes twelve weeks in total were assigned for theoretical classes. The remaining period of ten weeks was for practice classes and the measurements were performed before and after this ten weeks period. The hand grip strength measurement has been carried out with a Takkei branded hand dynamometer whereas for the measurement of the <b>finger</b> <b>grip</b> strength, a Baseline branded pinch meter has been used. For both the pre-test and final test of the <b>finger</b> <b>grip</b> and hand grip strength measurements, the paired sample t test has been used in terms of in-group comparisons, whereas for the inter-group comparisons, one-way ANOVA has been used. For the significant F values, post hoc Tukey test has been used. The right hand and the left hand grip values of both test groups as well as the values of the control group have been significantly increased between the pre-test and final test. Particularly, preferring the exercises that improve the hand and <b>finger</b> <b>grip</b> strengths would enable a better racket handle grip as well as an improved shot efficiency for tennis. This would also enable masseurs/masseuses to apply an efficient massage therapy with higher pressure...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{pattern of}} <b>finger</b> <b>grip</b> {{formation}} during natural prehension movements {{was described in}} normal subjects {{with the help of}} a quantified film technique. Movements were studied in one condition with visual feedback from the moving hand available, and one condition without visual feedback. The studied parameters, including the maximum size of the anticipatory grip and the final size of the grip before contact with the object, were not affected by shifting from one condition of visual feedback to the other. The same technique was applied to a group of patients with cerebral lesions. In two patients with unilateral lesions involving the motor cortex, grip formation with the hand contralateral to the lesion, was found to be severely affected, in that fingers and particularly the index finger, remained stretched until contact with the object was made. In two patients with unilateral lesions in the posterior parietal cortex, grip formation of the contralateral hand was absent specifically in the no-visual feedback condition. The same result was obtained in two other patients with a lesion (subcortical in one case, cortical in the other) of somatosensory pathways corresponding to one hand. These results are interpreted as evidence for the role of cerebral cortex in the control of <b>finger</b> <b>grip</b> formation during prehension of visual objects. Integration at cortical level of visual and somatosensory cues from the involved hand is a necessary condition for grip formation to be adapted to the grasp...|$|E
40|$|The {{transmission}} of vibration from tools, through work gloves {{and into the}} hands, is affected by many factors such as glove material properties, tool vibration conditions, temperature, and grip force. This study investigated how glove material properties affect tool vibration transmission into the index finger. Three samples of material (two taken from differently designed anti-vibration gloves and another for comparison that was designed for mounting vibration-sensitive equipment) were assessed using stepped sinusoidal vertical vibration excitations covering a range of a one-third octave band (from 20 to 400 Hz). Twelve human subjects {{were used for the}} testing. For all samples and subjects, measurements were obtained for: (I) dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) of the samples; (II) the transmissibility of vibration to the index finger at a grip force of 30 N, across the range of frequencies; and (III) transmissibility of vibration to the index finger at a frequency of 125 Hz for <b>finger</b> <b>grip</b> forces of 15, 30, and 45 N. No significant vibration attenuation was provided at frequencies below 150 Hz. The two materials taken from the gloves that passed the ISO 10819 : 1996 test showed resonance at frequencies of 150 and 160 Hz a, but the material that did not pass the ISO test showed resonance at 250 Hz. The attenuation for all three materials was occurred at 400 Hz. There was no significant change of transmissibility across the range of <b>finger</b> <b>grip</b> forces for any of the material samples. The level of transmissibility was found to vary between samples and subjects...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{findings}} show that the sensory-motor areas underlying finger movement {{play a critical role}} in numerical cognition. Given these links between embodied action perspectives and numerical concepts, we suggest that observing certain types of actions should have an effect on the selection and the production of numerical responses. Therefore, the present study assessed whether observing finger, hand or mouth movements were able to influence a random number generation task, and how the influence effect moderated for the different kinds of movements. The experimental task required that participants randomly produced a number between 1 and 10 after they first perceived an action stimulus of either closing or an opening finger, hand and mouth grip movement, or they perceived stimuli color changes (a control comparison condition). The results revealed that random number production was influenced by the prior presentation of the finger movements, whereby observing a closing <b>finger</b> <b>grip</b> movement led participants to produce more small than large numbers than in the baseline condition, while observing an opening <b>finger</b> <b>grip</b> movement led participants to produce more large than small numbers. For one of the hand movement (i. e., rope grip) conditions, the number production was not influenced. For the other hand movement (i. e., tennis ball grip) conditions, the closing movement induced participants to produce more small than large numbers. Finally, in the mouth movement condition, the observation of the mouth opening movement led participants to produce more large than small numbers. Taken together, these results showed that some of the characteristics of the observed finger, hand and mouth grip movements appeared to automatically prime the number generation task. The findings are discussed in terms of the functional and neural mechanisms that might explain the effect, and support the view that number semantics might be grounded on sensory-motor mechanisms...|$|E
