Modi's efforts at centralisation {{have been linked to}} {{an increase in the number}} of senior administration officials resigning their positions. Although the government has a majority of seats in the Lok Sabha, it does not <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> the Rajya Sabha, which led to its policies frequently being stymied there. Thus, Modi resorted to passing a number of ordinances to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of power. The government also passed a bill increasing the control that it had over the appointment of judges, and reducing that of the judiciary.|$|E
25|$|Modi's {{first year}} as prime {{minister}} saw significant centralization of power relative to previous administrations. Modi personally selected the civil servants who served under his ministers, frequently giving them instructions without involving the ministers themselves. Modi's efforts at centralisation {{have been linked to}} {{an increase in the number}} of senior administration officials resigning their positions. Although the government has a majority of seats in the Lok Sabha, it does not <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> the Rajya Sabha, which led to its policied frequently being stymied there. Thus, Modi resorted to passing a number of ordinances, or executive orders, to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of power. In 2014, the Prime Minister's Office prevented Gopal Subramaniam from being appointed to the Supreme Court. The stated reason was that his conduct in the 2G spectrum allocation scandal had been suspect: commentators stated it was because he had been the amicus curiae in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh case, which had implicated BJP leaders including Modi's aide Amit Shah. The government also passed a bill increasing the control that it had over the appointment of judges, and reducing that of the judiciary.|$|E

500|$|Brittany's role in {{the show}} was {{initially}} intended to be minor, but grew {{towards the end of}} the first season. She does not have any solo musical performances during season one, but Morris hoped she would <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> the second season. On April 27, 2010, Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly reported that Morris would be upgraded to a series regular for season two. Speaking to E! Online, Morris commented: [...] "It's so fun. I literally just stand there and doze off and then I'm like, 'Oh yeah, I have to speak now! At the 2010 Television Critics Association Summer Press Tour, Murphy stated that Brittany would have [...] "big storylines" [...] in the new season, as viewers want to know more about her.|$|E
500|$|The episode further {{illustrates}} the greed of corporate culture by portraying Mickey as capitalizing on religion for profit, while secretly mocking it {{in a particularly}} contemptuous tone: [...] "I've made billions off of Christian ignorance for decades now! And do you know why? Because Christians are retarded! They believe in a talking dead guy!" [...] "The Ring" [...] ends with a tongue-in-cheek cautionary message against engaging in oral sex, depicting Kenny's death from a sexually transmitted disease in the final moments of the episode. When asked whether Stone really believed purity rings were [...] "lame", as they were portrayed in [...] "The Ring", he said, [...] "Well, I don't know. I didn't <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> high school, and I was still lame." ...|$|E

50|$|D&D Heroscape {{introduced}} a fifth type, Uncommon Heroes, which play like unique heroes but a player can <b>have</b> more than <b>one</b> <b>in</b> his army.

500|$|Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a {{slightly}} negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. Despite noting, [...] "after episodes about butt-crawling and vomiting, it's {{a relief to}} <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> which people die when their skin and muscles are fried away by microscopic sea creatures called medusas", Vitaris was critical of the plot, likening it to [...] "cliche" [...] 1970's movies that featured the [...] "obstreperous official insisting the plane must fly or the skyscraper is fire-proof, even when the potential for catastrophe is staring him in the face." [...] Spotnitz later admitted during a Reddit IAmA that the episode was his least-favorite that he had written because [...] "the concept just wasn't clear or compelling enough to sustain the hour." ...|$|E
500|$|In Super Street Fighter IV, the {{developers}} attempted to retain Ibuki's playstyle and feel from Street Fighter III. She was also given a super jump (the only character, other than C. Viper, to <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> this game) and made adjustments to have combos that utilize it. Capcom's Taketoshi Sano said that [...] "Ibuki is suited {{to those who}} want {{to get the most out}} of a single character" [...] and [...] "beginners can use her too, but if I had to pick I'd say she's suited for intermediate." [...] Capcom Europe described Ibuki’s [...] "Raida" [...] ("Thunder Strike") command grab as having some unique properties and being one of the most powerful moves in the game. According to an MTV guide, Ibuki is [...] "one of the hardest characters to master in this latest iteration" [...] and players need to gain [...] "a strong understanding of each character's moves and abilities before truly coming to grips with what the weak, yet versatile Ibuki has to offer." ...|$|E
500|$|Gary Burton, of Berklee College of Music, {{noted the}} {{consistent}} innovation present throughout the album, stating: [...] "It wasn’t just one tune {{that was a}} breakthrough, it was the whole record. When new jazz styles come along, the first few attempts to do it are usually kind of shaky. Early Charlie Parker records were like this. But with Kind of Blue [...] all sound like they’re fully into it." [...] Along with the Dave Brubeck Quartet's Time Out (1959) and Coltrane's Giant Steps (1960), Kind of Blue has often been recommended by music writers as an introductory jazz album, for similar reasons: the music on both records is very melodic, and the relaxed quality of the songs makes the improvisation easy for listeners to follow, without sacrificing artistry or experimentation. Upon {{the release of the}} 50th anniversary collector's edition of the album, a columnist for All About Jazz stated [...] "Kind of Blue heralded the arrival of a revolutionary new American music, a post-bebop modal jazz structured around simple scales and melodic improvisation. Trumpeter/band leader/composer Miles Davis assembled a sextet of legendary players to create a sublime atmospheric masterpiece. Fifty years after its release, Kind of Blue continues to transport listeners to a realm all its own while inspiring musicians to create to new sounds—from acoustic jazz to post-modern ambient—in every genre imaginable." [...] Later in an interview, renowned hip-hop artist and rapper Q-Tip reaffirmed the album's reputation and influence when discussing the significance of Kind of Blue, stating [...] "It's like the Bible—you just <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> your house." [...] The 2014 album Blue by Mostly Other People Do the Killing is a note-for-note reproduction of Kind of Blue.|$|E

2500|$|Near {{the main}} {{entrance}} of the temple are situated the Dvajasthamba, sacrificial altar called pali peedam and vehicle called vahanam facing the main deity. [...] Pali Peedam or altar is for offering - Shiva temples being vegetarian, the offering is usually flowers and cooked rice. [...] Most Shiva temples in South India <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> each direction and some {{have as many as}} 8 for the 8 directions. [...] The usual shape of the altar is a stone of masanory on a platform topped by lotifarm altar, called the lotus altar. [...] The lotifarm altar has a base, a cup shaped upside down over it and lotus like petals from the frills that widen towards the base. [...] The lotifram shape is considered a symbole of prosperity and hence this is considered bhadra linga or the prosperour lingam.|$|E
2500|$|The {{inclusion}} of the shepherd's dog, especially right by the crib, is unusual, though the shepherds very often <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> scenes of their annunciation, and sometimes bring a lamb to the crib as a gift; here the dove held by {{the boy in the}} foreground is intended to represent a gift. [...] In the 17th century the shepherds often crowd round the crib, as here, and Mary actively displays her child to them. [...] However her gesture of lifting a cloth, revealing a full view of a naked Jesus, including his penis, is unusual in art by this date. [...] In the late medieval period pictures of the infant Jesus often made a point of displaying his genitals for theological reasons, but in the Counter-Reformation this was discouraged by clerical interpreters of the vague decrees on art of the Council of Trent, such as Saint Charles Borromeo.|$|E

2500|$|Call hours {{have been}} greatly restricted. In July 2003, strict rules {{went into effect}} for all {{residency}} programs in the US, known to residents as the [...] "work hours rules". Among other things, these rules limited a resident {{to no more than}} 80 hours of work in a week (averaged over 4 weeks), no more than 24 hours of clinical duties at a stretch with an additional 6 hours for transferring patient care and educational requirement (with no new patients in the last six), and call no more often than every third night. In-house call for most residents these days is typically one night in four; surgery and obstetrics residents are more likely to <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> three call. A few decades ago, in-house call every third night or every other night was the standard. While on paper this has decreased hours, in many programs there has been no decrease in resident work hours, only a decrease in hours recorded. Even though many sources cite that resident work hours have decreased, residents are commonly encouraged or forced to hide their work hours to appear to comply with the 80 hour limits.|$|E
2500|$|The vogue for {{portrait}} drawings intensified during Catherine de' Medici's life, and she {{may have}} regarded part of her collection as the equivalent of today's family photograph album. Catherine loved having her children painted: [...] "I would like", she wrote in 1547 to her children's governor, Jean d'Humières, [...] "to have paintings of all the children done [...] [...] [...] and sent to me, without delay, {{as soon as they}} are finished". However, the more formal pictures include a high proportion of portraits of European kings and queens, past and present, most of which she probably commissioned personally. On 3 July 1571, Catherine wrote to Monsieur de la Mothe-Fénelon, ambassador in London, discussing the work of François Clouet and requesting a portrait of Queen Elizabeth. Catherine gave detailed instructions: [...] "I pray you do me the pleasure that I may soon have a painting of the queen of England of small volume, in great , and that it be well portrayed and done in the same fashion as the one sent be by the earl of Leicester, and ask, as I already <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> full face, {{it would be better to}} have her turning to the right." ...|$|E
