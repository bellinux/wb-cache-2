The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate genetic parameters for survival and weight of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), farmed in cages and ponds in Brazil, and to predict genetic gain under different scenarios. Survival was recorded as a binary response (dead or alive), during harvest time in the 2008 grow-out period. Genetic parameters were estimated using a Bayesian mixed linear-threshold animal model via Gibbs sampling. The breeding population consisted of 2, 912 individual fish, which were analyzed together with the pedigree of 5, 394 fish. The heritabilities estimates, with 95 % posterior credible intervals, for tagging weight, harvest weight and survival were 0. 17 (0. 09 ? 0. 27), 0. 21 (0. 12 ? 0. 32) and 0. 32 (0. 22 ? 0. 44), respectively.

40|$|The one {{dimensional}} heat transfer, thermal diode effect of heat pipes makes them ideal for passive solar applications. Gains in a heat pipe passive solar wall are not lost during cloud cover or periods of low irradiation. An experimental model {{was built to}} test {{the performance of a}} heat pipe passive solar wall in a laboratory setting. Experimental variations included varying fluid fill levels and the addition of insulation along the adiabatic section of the heat pipe. Filling the heat pipe to 120 % volume of the evaporator section and insulating the adiabatic section achieved efficiencies of 85 %. The average rate of water tank temperature change for 80 %, 100 %, 120 %, and 140 % fill levels was 1. 153 °C/hr, 1. 195 °C/hr, 1. 227 °C/hr, and 1. 203 °C/hr, respectively. The addition of fins along the condenser of the heat pipe did not significantly enhance the overall performance. A computer model was constructed to simulate the performance of direct gain, <b>indirect</b> <b>gain,</b> and integrated heat pipe passive solar systems in different climates. The locations selected include: Louisville, Kentucky; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Madison, Wisconsin; and Rock Springs, Wyoming. Integrated heat pipe systems performed better than their direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>gain</b> counterparts in all climates. The water wall <b>indirect</b> <b>gain</b> system outperformed concrete wall systems in all climates. The lowest solar fractions were achieved by the direct gain system in all climates except Albuquerque, New Mexico (sunny and cool). The mild temperatures and cloudiness of Louisville, Kentucky provided an excellent climate for passive solar systems. Passive solar systems in Louisville (cloudy and cool) performed better than Madison, Wisconsin (cloudy and cold) and Rock Springs Wyoming (sunny and cold). Integrated heat pipe wall design variations were analyzed to achieve the best overall performance. These variations included: glazing thickness, extinction coefficient, absorber plate and heat pipe material, selective surface, insulation thickness, and water tank size. Decreasing the thickness of the glazing by 7. 15 mm improved the solar fraction by 2. 69 %. Changing from a greenish cast glass to a low iron glass reduces the extinction coefficient and improves solar fraction by 8. 82 %. Switching absorber plate and heat pipe material from copper to aluminum reduces cost and decrease the solar fraction by 2. 23 %. Having the absorber plate electroplated with a black chrome surface opposed to painting the collector with flat black paint increase the solar fraction from 19. 28 % to 48. 36 %. Changing the insulation thickness around the collector improves the overall losses of the collector. Raising the R-value by a factor of 5 improved the solar fraction by 0. 12 %. Increased water tank size improves solar fraction but increases the units weight. Validation of the computer model was made by simulating the laboratory experiments and comparing the data. Temperatures across the system were matched by adjusting the calculated conductances. The computer simulation was able to graphically match the measured temperatures of the experiment. Conduction between the evaporator and condenser sections of the heat pipe was only 6 % of the calculated value. An economic assessment was then performed to analyze the overall cost of the unit, deliver design recommendations, optimize cost, complete life cycle costing and calculate payback period. The most cost effective design would incorporate an aluminum absorber plate with four heat pipes. The solar glazing would have one cover and be made with low iron glass (3 / 32 nd inch thick). For the city of Louisville with a load to collector ratio of 10 W/m 2 K the total cost of the unit would be $ 1825. 46 for a collector area of 2. 43 m 2 (26. 12 ft 2).

40|$|PresentationFrom mid 2000, {{in order}} to address global challenges, European member states’ {{strategies}} for agriculture have progressively identified and given priority to the set up of a multi-functional farm models. In France, to achieve both food security and socio-environmental sustainability, the design, test and deployment of new Productive and Efficient Cropping Systems (PECS) was then engaged. Therefore, those of the particular PECS targeting the re-conquest of water quality often work at reducing drastically, or even renouncing to chemical pesticides. For that, within the 2012 EXPE Dephy Ecophyto program, a 6 -years SCA 0 PEST project (pesticide-free agroforestry cropping system) has been funded. Considering the experimental farm objectives and local sectors' potentials, SCA 0 PEST objectives are (i) the review of the current conventional agroforestry cropping system and its experts' opinions-based re-design by respecting principles of integrated pest & weed management, (ii) the set up of 6 over 8 of the crops of the crop rotation each year, (iii) the ex-ante and continuous economic, environmental and social assessments of its performances. Depending on raw products sale prices, energy and fertilizers costs, preliminary SCA 0 PEST ex-ante assessment provided limited economic prevision, as direct margin would decrease from 140 up to 250 €/ha mainly due to yield losses and additional costs for seeds. Conversely, environmental performance would be improved as annual GHG emissions from the cultivated compartment fall down to 1140 kg eq. CO 2 /ha (48 % of the reference cropping system with pesticides); additionally, when simulated, annualized carbon sequestration by trees should reach 650 kg eq. CO 2 /ha. Finally, inclusion of a 2 -years alfalfa production within the rotation would provide a supplementary 230 €/ha <b>indirect</b> <b>gain</b> when incorporated at 40 % within the dairy cows ration. If this first SCA 0 PEST assessment points an acceptable economic balance and an improved environmental footprint, continuous assessments would have to confirm the potential of this innovative free-pesticide cropping system...|$|E
40|$|The flows {{induced by}} natural {{convection}} appear in many engineering problems. Configurations formed by heated plates where these processes occur, were {{the topic of}} intense study in past years. However, new systems with a different constructive disposition and applications in several fields (bioclimatic architecture, electronic cooling, nuclear energy cooling systems) are {{at the moment of}} great interest. Since typical applications of buoyancy-driven airflows in smooth vertical channels are usually in small-scale devices (i. e. in electronic cooling equipment), most investigations were carried out for laminar flows. As a consequence of the great scale of certain passive ventilation systems, as solar chimneys, Trombe walls, or roof collectors, the flow established becomes transitional or even fully turbulent. The regarded geometries frequently involve structures based on converging and sloped channels formed by heated plates, where buoyancy-driven flows take place. Therefore, the study of problems such as the transition to turbulent regime or flows with walled-channel geometries including sloped and converging walls are key to assertively find out the real heating transmission existing in these new systems in a more realistic manner. Nowadays, the need to achieve human comfort by passive heating and ventilation techniques is greater as is the requirement for energy saving. Passive solar systems are the basic elements of bioclimatic design and they do not involve the use of mechanical or electrical devices. The Trombe Wall is the primary example of the technique called <b>indirect</b> <b>gain,</b> whose typical configuration is usually formed by a thick, darkened, masonry wall and a glazed wall. In ventilation applications, other passive systems, called thermosyphons, heat syphons or solar chimneys, can yield natural motions of air due to the induced temperature differences by solar heating. Although several reported works provided useful results for the analysis and design of passive solar devices in buildings, these works cannot determine the necessary details of convection for numerical simulations. Furthermore, as an important lack of design correlations is detected, it is necessary to carry out a systematic study that supplied the heat transfer coefficient and the mass-flow rate as a function of relevant parameters, for several configurations...|$|E

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{whether and how}} the persistence of inequality {{and the presence of}} inequality traps carry over the persistence of poverty and possible aggregate economic inefficiencies. We propose a microeconomic formalization of one possible definition of poverty and of the behaviour of poor and rich agents. Poverty is defined as lack of or low societal participation, which is source of both a direct private benefit and an <b>indirect</b> <b>gain.</b> Analysing poverty under the individual rational choice, we are able to endogeneize the threshold amount of the participation good needed to join the additional indirect benefit as well as the threshold level of income - the poverty line - needed to buy that amount; further we find the conditions for their existence which in turn determine also their level. In an overlapping generation structure we show that in economies starting largely poor two equilibria exist; one low locally stable equilibrium to which low and middle-income class converge and one upper locally unstable over the which richer classes of income enter an explosive path, with unbounded growth rates of personal income. In the rich regime the whole population enter the explosive path, with unbounded growth rates. We are able to enrich the dynamics a là Galor and Zeira (1993) in an economic environment with perfect capital markets, instead of the assumption of markets imperfections, by introducing a methodological innovation which connects the presence of the externality in the human capital accumulation of the children directly to the preference of parents. By further restricting the functional form of the initial income distribution to be lognormal we find that the mean income and the variance (i. e. inequality) of the richer part of the distribution are always higher than the ones of the lower part; moreover, while within the poor class inequality tends to zero in the very long-run, within the richer class inequality is increasing at an increasing rate. Finally, a negative relation between initial inequality and economic growth is observed. The inequality traps which cause the poor regime to emerge are also sources of aggregate economic inefficiencies, which can be eliminated by reducing income disparities accordingly. ...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, it {{is clear}} that the target of {{creating}} a sustainable future for the next generations requires to re-think the industrial application of chemistry. It is also evident that more sustainable chemical processes may be economically convenient, in comparison with the conventional ones, because fewer by-products means lower costs for raw materials, for separation and for disposal treatments; but also it implies an increase of productivity and, as a consequence, smaller reactors can be used. In addition, an <b>indirect</b> <b>gain</b> could derive from the better public image of the company, marketing sustainable products or processes. In this context, oxidation reactions play a major role, being the tool for the production of huge quantities of chemical intermediates and specialties. Potentially, the impact of these productions on the environment could have been much worse than it is, if a continuous efforts hadn’t been spent to improve the technologies employed. Substantial technological innovations have driven the development of new catalytic systems, the improvement of reactions and process technologies, contributing to move the chemical industry in the direction of a more sustainable and ecological approach. The roadmap for the application of these concepts includes new synthetic strategies, alternative reactants, catalysts heterogenisation and innovative reactor configurations and process design. Actually, in order to implement all these ideas into real projects, the development of more efficient reactions is one primary target. Yield, selectivity and space-time yield are the right metrics for evaluating the reaction efficiency. In the case of catalytic selective oxidation, the control of selectivity has always been the principal issue, because the formation of total oxidation products (carbon oxides) is thermodynamically more favoured than the formation of the desired, partially oxidized compound. As a matter of fact, only in few oxidation reactions a total, or close to total, conversion is achieved, and usually the selectivity is limited by the formation of by-products or co-products, that often implies unfavourable process economics; moreover, sometimes the cost of the oxidant further penalizes the process. During my PhD work, I have investigated four reactions that are emblematic of the new approaches used in the chemical industry. In the Part A of my thesis, a new process aimed at a more sustainable production of menadione (vitamin K 3) is described. The “greener” approach includes the use of hydrogen peroxide in place of chromate (from a stoichiometric oxidation to a catalytic oxidation), also avoiding the production of dangerous waste. Moreover, I have studied the possibility of using an heterogeneous catalytic system, able to efficiently activate hydrogen peroxide. Indeed, the overall process would be carried out in two different steps: the first is the methylation of 1 -naphthol with methanol to yield 2 -methyl- 1 -naphthol, the second one is the oxidation of the latter compound to menadione. The catalyst for this latter step, the reaction object of my investigation, consists of Nb 2 O 5 -SiO 2 prepared with the sol-gel technique. The catalytic tests were first carried out under conditions that simulate the in-situ generation of hydrogen peroxide, that means using a low concentration of the oxidant. Then, experiments were carried out using higher hydrogen peroxide concentration. The study of the reaction mechanism was fundamental to get indications about the best operative conditions, and improve the selectivity to menadione. In the Part B, I explored the direct oxidation of benzene to phenol with hydrogen peroxide. The industrial process for phenol is the oxidation of cumene with oxygen, that also co-produces acetone. This can be considered a case of how economics could drive the sustainability issue; in fact, the new process allowing to obtain directly phenol, besides avoiding the co-production of acetone (a burden for phenol, because the market requirements for the two products are quite different), might be economically convenient with respect to the conventional process, if a high selectivity to phenol were obtained. Titanium silicalite- 1 (TS- 1) is the catalyst chosen for this reaction. Comparing the reactivity results obtained with some TS- 1 samples having different chemical-physical properties, and analyzing in detail the effect of the more important reaction parameters, we could formulate some hypothesis concerning the reaction network and mechanism. Part C of my thesis deals with the hydroxylation of phenol to hydroquinone and catechol. This reaction is already industrially applied but, for economical reason, an improvement of the selectivity to the para di-hydroxilated compound and a decrease of the selectivity to the ortho isomer would be desirable. Also in this case, the catalyst used was the TS- 1. The aim of my research was to find out a method to control the selectivity ratio between the two isomers, and finally to make the industrial process more flexible, in order to adapt the process performance in function of fluctuations of the market requirements. The reaction was carried out in both a batch stirred reactor and in a re-circulating fixed-bed reactor. In the first system, the effect of various reaction parameters on catalytic behaviour was investigated: type of solvent or co-solvent, and particle size. With the second reactor type, I investigated the possibility to use a continuous system, and the catalyst shaped in extrudates (instead of powder), in order to avoid the catalyst filtration step. Finally, part D deals with the study of a new process for the valorisation of glycerol, by means of transformation into valuable chemicals. This molecule is nowadays produced in big amount, being a co-product in biodiesel synthesis; therefore, it is considered a raw material from renewable resources (a bio-platform molecule). Initially, we tested the oxidation of glycerol in the liquid-phase, with hydrogen peroxide and TS- 1. However, results achieved were not satisfactory. Then we investigated the gas-phase transformation of glycerol into acrylic acid, with the intermediate formation of acrolein; the latter can be obtained by dehydration of glycerol, and then can be oxidized into acrylic acid. Actually, the oxidation step from acrolein to acrylic acid is already optimized at an industrial level; therefore, we decided to investigate in depth the first step of the process. I studied the reactivity of heterogeneous acid catalysts based on sulphated zirconia. Tests were carried out both in aerobic and anaerobic conditions, in order to investigate the effect of oxygen on the catalyst deactivation rate (one main problem usually met in glycerol dehydration). Finally, I studied the reactivity of bifunctional systems, made of Keggin-type polyoxometalates, either alone or supported over sulphated zirconia, in this way combining the acid functionality (necessary for the dehydrative step) with the redox one (necessary for the oxidative step). In conclusion, during my PhD work I investigated reactions that apply the “green chemistry” rules and strategies; in particular, I studied new greener approaches for the synthesis of chemicals (Part A and Part B), the optimisation of reaction parameters to make the oxidation process more flexible (Part C), and the use of a bioplatform molecule for the synthesis of a chemical intermediate (Part D). ...|$|E

At the 2014 World Economic Forum, Internet experts saw news that Microsoft would let foreign customers store their personal data on servers outside America {{as a sign that}} Snowden's leaks were leading countries and companies to erect borders in cyberspace. In Forbes, the effect was seen to have nearly united the U.S. Congress in opposition to the massive post-9/11 domestic intelligence gathering system. In its Spring 2014 Global Attitudes Survey, the Pew Research Center found that Snowden's disclosures had tarnished the image of the United States, especially in Europe and Latin America.|$|R
40|$|Significant {{genotype}} vs. environment interaction (G x E) {{is expected}} {{as a result}} of geographical diversity and differences in management techniques in melon growing. Ninety-six F 3 families from the cross between inodorus and conomon melons were evaluated in three environments for studying interaction. The G x E interaction, genetic parameters, and direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>gains</b> were estimated. Average weight of the fruit, pulp thickness, cavity thickness, pulp firmness, and soluble solids were evaluated. The simple part of the G x E interaction was always greater than 99 %, except for pulp firmness, where there was predominance of the complex part. The coefficient of genetic variation and genetic variance were overestimated by the G x E interaction. The direct gains from selection were higher than the indirect, except when selection was made by the mean of the three environments. Genotype assessments in more than one location are necessary, but selection should be made by the mean values of families in the environments...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{evaluated}} the phenotypic, genetic and environmental parameters {{for the following}} wood physical properties:basic density, radial, tangential, volumetric shrinkage and anisotropy coefficient. It also assessed the <b>indirect</b> genetic <b>gains</b> in thephysical properties of wood by the selection of amplitude for longitudinal residual strains evaluated using a non-destructive method. A total of 13 Eucalyptus clones aged 10 years were used. The experiment was established in a completely randomized design with threereplicates. The non-destructive measures were evaluated using extensometer and resistograph. After the quantification of thosecharacteristics, the sawing of the logs was performed and 70. 0 cm samples {{were removed from the}} top of each board for the makingof specimens preparation and determination of physical properties of wood. The heritability values for the basic density, radial,tangential, volumetric shrinkage and the anisotropy coefficient were considered high 96, 90, 94, 92 and 72, respectively. It was foundthat <b>indirect</b> genetic <b>gains</b> in the basic density can be efficiently reached when selecting for amplitude, supplied by the resistograph. Theresistograph proved efficient to evaluate genetic materials in the field...|$|R

40|$|The {{study has}} {{quantified}} the welfare gains from adoption of Bt cotton in India. The adoption of Bt cotton has increased income levels and generated substantial gains due to higher yields and lower {{cost of production}} through lower cost on plant protection. During the period 2002 - 15, the total benefit has been estimated to be of ` 220 billion with 85 per cent share accruing to the producers and 15 per cent to the private seed companies / marketing firms. The welfare gains {{have been found to}} vary across states, depending upon the extent of penetration of Bt technology and agronomic performance of the crop. In India, Bt gene is embedded in hybrids as a value-capturing mechanism, necessitating seed purchase by farmers every season afresh. One policy option to improve the producer surplus could be development of the open pollinated Bt varieties in the country that may provide higher benefits to the adopters in resource-poor regions, which are generally more suited for varieties than hybrids. The study has also highlighted some <b>indirect</b> <b>gains</b> in terms of soil health, green house emission, human health, to cite a few...|$|R
40|$|Informed {{debate on}} {{agricultural}} nonpoint pollution requires evaluation of regional water quality {{in relation to}} management practices. It is prohibitive, in terms of cost and time, to run the site-specific process models for regional policy analysis. Therefore, a simplified and robust technique [...] metamodeling [...] is suggested to evaluate regional water quality. Data from an experimentally designed simulation of complex surface water and groundwater process models, PRZM and STREAM, are used to develop statistically validated metamodels. The estimated metamodels were integrated with a regional agricultural economic decision making model to evaluate the surface water and groundwater loadings of 16 major corn and sorghum herbicides. Spatial probability distributions are derived for herbicide concentrations exceeding the toxicity-weighted benchmark from the EPA. We estimate that 1. 2 percent of the regional soils will lead to groundwater detection of atrazine exceeding 0. 12 ?/L, which compares well {{with the findings of}} the EPA 2 ̆ 7 s groundwater monitoring survey. We find no-till practices to significantly reduce the surface water concentration of atrazine and other herbicides with less impact on groundwater contamination suggesting <b>indirect</b> <b>gains</b> to soil conservation policies. But we also note that an atrazine ban could lead to increased soil erosion, even with the conservation compliance provisions fully incorporated...|$|R
