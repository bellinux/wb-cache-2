Previous research has shown that belt-positioning boosters reduce injury risk, but the belt fit produced by the wide range of boosters in the US market has not previously been assessed. The present study describes the development of a method for quantifying belt fit with a Hybrid-III 6 -year-old test dummy. The measurement method was applied in a laboratory seat mockup to 31 boosters (10 in both backless and highback modes) across a range of belt geometries obtained from in-vehicle measurements. Belt fit varied widely across boosters. Backless boosters generally produced better lap belt fit than highback boosters, largely because adding the back component moved the dummy forward with respect to the lap belt routing guides. However, highback boosters produced more consistent shoulder belt fit {{because of the presence of}} belt routing guides near the shoulder. Some boosters performed well on both lap belt and shoulder belt fit. Lap belt fit in dedicated boosters was generally better than in combination restraints that also can be used with an <b>integrated</b> <b>harness.</b> Results demonstrate that certain booster design features produce better belt fit across a wide range of belt geometries.

Social identity resourcing includes two forms: <b>harnessing</b> and <b>integrating.</b> <b>Harnessing</b> refers to practices that enable organizational members to share their perspectives on how global diversity management should be approached. Integrating reflects the actual use of different perspectives to implement a global vision and strategy for diversity management. In doing so, this essay departs from past research on global diversity management which focuses revealing the differences between a global and a multi-domestic (i. e., country-level) approach to diversity management (e. g., Nishii 2 ̆ 6 Ozbilgin, 2007; Sippola 2 ̆ 6 Smale, 2007) or highlighting a conceptual framework for managing global diversity (Mor Barak, 2014).

Many airports are expanding from a narrow concentration on operating as transportation centres to becoming economic hubs. By working together, airports and other industry sectors can contribute to and facilitate not only economic prosperity, but create social advantage for local and regional areas in new ways. This transformation of the function and orientation of airports has been termed the aerotropolis or airport metropolis, where the airport is recognised as an economic centre with land uses that link local and global markets. This chapter contends that the conversion of an airport into a sustainable airport metropolis requires more than just industry clustering {{and the existence of}} hard physical infrastructure. Attention must also be directed to the creation and on-going development of social infrastructure within proximate areas and the maximisation of connectivity flows within and between infrastructure elements.

These arguments challenge elite models of policy research and {{suggest the need for}} an ambitious expansion of more inclusive scientific public policy research. Enabling the public to be meaningfully involved in complex policy research remains a challenge. This paper explores a range of attempts to involving the public in public policy research. It uses a binary framing to typify some key debates and differences in approaches between community-based participatory research, and citizen science. Approaches to community-based participatory research in the social sciences offer a set of engagement principles which are an alternative to an elite model of policy research. Citizen science offers a focus on the use of scientific methods by lay people, but this approach is currently under-utilized in public policy research and could be expanded.

Based on a framework of three features of democratic and scientific policy research, it argues that more public participation in public policy research would be helped by more attention to the strengths of the democratic potential emphasised by participatory community-based research, alongside the potential of scientific robustness em-phasised by citizen science. One conclusion drawn is that a professional and scientific orientation to public policy research can be retained without necessarily being professionally dominated. Research methods and skills are tools to which more people outside the profession could have access, if academics facilitate the process of democratization of policy research...|$|R

Extensive expression profiling on human brain samples and other tissues, followed by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis indicates that at least 24 of these lncRNAs are indeed implicated in processes such as synaptic transmission, nervous system development and neurogenesis. The bidirectional or antisense overlapping orientation relative to multiple coding genes involved in neuronal processes supports these results.

These powerful computing cores are mainly used for accelerating graphics applications or enabling low-cost scientific computing. To further reduce the cost and form factor, an emerging trend is to integrate GPU along with the memory controllers onto the same die with the processor cores. However, given such a system-on-chip, the GPU, while occupying a substantial part of the silicon, will sit idle and contribute nothing to the overall system performance when running non-graphics workloads or applications lack of data-level parallelism.

In hydro schemes, the turbines that drive the electricity generators are directly powered either from a reservoir or the ‘run of the river’.

These schemes have been producing power in Karnataka for many years, with the first hydroelectric station built in 1942. The {{majority of them are}} in Uttara Kannada district. Due to environmental constraints, further construction of storage reservoirs is limited and attention has been focussed towards developing environmental friendly small-scale hydro schemes to cater for the needs of the region. In this paper, the assessment of potential carried out in the streams of Bedthi and Aghnashini river basins in Uttara Kannada district of Western Ghats is discussed. Potentials at five feasible sites are assessed based on stream gauging carried out for a period of 18 months.

In {{the development of new}} therapeutic agents, it is essential that the potential adverse effects of all candidates be identified as early as possible. The field of predictive toxicology strives to profile the potential for adverse effects of novel chemical substances before they occur, both with traditional in vivo experimental approaches and increasingly through the development of in vitro and computational methods which can supplement and reduce the need for animal testing. To be maximally effective, the field needs access to the largest possible knowledge base of previous toxicology findings, and such results need to be made available in such a fashion so as to be interoperable, comparable, and compatible with standard toolkits. This necessitates the development of open, public, computable, and standardized toxicology vocabularies and ontologies so as to support the applications required by in silico, in vitro, and in vivo toxicology methods and related analysis and reporting activities. Such ontology development will support data management, model building, integrated analysis, validation and reporting, including regulatory reporting and alternative testing submission requirements as required by guidelines such as the REACH legislation, leading to new scientific advances in a mechanistically-based predictive toxicology.

The multitudes of metadata originating from HCV clinical trials as well as low and high-throughput experiments embedded in text corpora can be mined as data sources {{for the implementation of}} HCV-specific resources. HCV-customized resources may support the generation of worthy and testable hypothesis and reveal potential research clues to augment the pursuit of efficient diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This research thesis report the development of two freely available HCV-specific web-based resources: (i) Dragon Exploratory System on Hepatitis C Virus (DESHCV) accessible via [URL] or [URL] and (ii) Hepatitis C Virus Protein Interaction Database (HCVpro) accessible via [URL] or [URL] DESHCV is a text mining system implemented using named concept recognition and cooccurrence based approaches to computationally analyze about 32, 000 HCV related abstracts obtained from PubMed. As part of DESHCV development, the pre-constructed dictionaries of the Dragon Exploratory System (DES) were enriched with HCV biomedical concepts, including HCV proteins, name variants and symbols to enable HCV knowledge specific exploration. The DESHCV query inputs consist of user-defined keywords, phrases and concepts. DESHCV is therefore an information extraction tool that enables users to computationally generate association between concepts and support the prediction of potential hypothesis with diagnostic and therapeutic relevance. Additionally, users can retrieve a list of abstracts containing tagged concepts {{that can be used to}} overcome the herculean task of manual biocuration. DESHCV has been used to simulate previously reported thalidomide-chronic hepatitis C hypothesis and also to model a potentially novel thalidomide-amantadine hypothesis. HCVpro is a relational knowledgebase dedicated to housing experimentally detected HCV-HCV and HCV-human protein interaction information obtained from other databases and curated from biomedical journal articles. Additionally, the database contains consolidated biological information consisting of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) related genes, comprehensive reviews on HCV biology and drug development, functional genomics and molecular biology data, and cross-referenced links to canonical pathways and other essential biomedical databases. Users can retrieve enriched information including interaction metadata from HCVpro by using protein identifiers, gene chromosomal locations, experiment types used in detecting the interactions, PubMed IDs of journal articles reporting the interactions, annotated protein interaction IDs from external databases, and via “string searches”. The utility of HCVpro has been demonstrated by <b>harnessing</b> <b>integrated</b> data to suggest putative baseline clues that seem to support current diagnostic exploratory efforts directed towards vimentin. Furthermore, eight genes comprising of ACLY, AZGP 1, DDX 3 X, FGG, H 19, SIAH 1, SERPING 1 and THBS 1 have been recommended for possible investigation to evaluate their diagnostic potential. The data archived in HCVpro can be utilized to support protein-protein interaction network-based candidate HCC gene prioritization for possible validation by experimental biologists.
