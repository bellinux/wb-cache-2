500|$|As {{stated by}} Scott Shetler of AOL Radio and Matthew Horton of BBC, the song {{features}} an aggressive tone, and dizzying percussion and electro elements create a [...] "frenzied pace that Hilson matches with an intense vocal delivery." [...] During {{the bridge and}} the chorus, she utters gasps and groans, like 'oohs and aahs' while singing the lyrics. As the first verse begins, Hilson sings: [...] "Ooh ahh, baby don't stop / You know how I like it Daddy {{when you hit the}} spot / Ooh ahh, baby don't stop / Imma take control when <b>I</b> <b>climb</b> up on top". As the song progresses, Hilson sings that she is [...] "so good, I'll make you think the bed is my workplace [...] Yeah, it's me, that's where you wanna be / I got the kind of pussy that'll keep you out the streets" [...] just before Ross's verse begins, seemingly summing up the image Hilson is going for: [...] "She looks like an angel, but she's sexy as hell." [...] As a whole, the lyrical arrangements are about sexual desire and not holding back.|$|E

6000|$|When the Shaykh Mohammed {{sits with}} me, or <b>I</b> <b>climb</b> {{up into his}} little shop {{for the purpose of}} {{receiving}} a lesson from him, he is quite at his ease, reading when he likes, or making me read, and generally beginning each lecture with some such preamble as this[FN#34]:- ...|$|E

Under this I grind; but I believe the place will suit me. Must stop.--Ever affectionately, ...|$|E

6000|$|When on my goodly charger borne [...] Thro' dreaming towns I go, [...] The cock crows ere the Christmas morn, [...] The {{streets are}} dumb with snow.

I crossed dusty roads; I went through tall grass; I climbed hills in the moonlight. Even rocks did <b>I</b> <b>climb,</b> children--consider this well. I crossed the tail of Sirhind, the waterless, before I could find the set of the little rivers that flow Gungaward. I was a month's journey from my own people and the river that I knew. That was very marvellous!" ...|$|E
