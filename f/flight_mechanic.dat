The occasional long-range reconnaissance flight over the Bering Sea was still flown, given that the range of the Twin Mustang was much greater than that of the F-94. The right seat of the aircraft was usually occupied by an experienced <b>flight</b> <b>mechanic.</b> With the long patrol flights with high-hour aircraft, pilots began having more and more mechanical problems that forced them to land on crude flight strips. The mechanic usually could repair the aircraft well enough to get airborne and head straight back to Ladd AFB.|$|E
25|$|One {{month after}} his 18th {{birthday}} on 19 May 1944 Brabham enlisted into the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Although he was keen on becoming a pilot, {{there was already}} a surplus of trained aircrew and the Air Force instead put his mechanical skills {{to use as a}} <b>flight</b> <b>mechanic,</b> of which there was a wartime shortage. He was based at RAAF Station Williamtown, where he maintained Bristol Beaufighters at No. 5 Operational Training Unit. On his 20th birthday, 2 April 1946, Brabham was discharged from the RAAF with the rank of leading aircraftman. He then started a small service, repair, and machining business in a workshop built by his uncle on a plot of land behind his grandfather's house.|$|E

Prince Ali Yusuf gives a fortune in jewels into the safekeeping of Bob Rawlinson, his pilot and the only person he trusts to take them out of the country. Rawlinson conceals the jewels in the luggage of his sister, Mrs Joan Sutcliffe, travelling with her daughter, Jennifer. He is seen doing this by a rather sinister woman via a handheld mirror on her balcony in the next room. Soon after, both Ali Yusuf and Bob Rawlinson are killed in an aeroplane crash after a <b>flight</b> <b>mechanic</b> sabotages their plane. British Intelligence among others get onto the trail of the jewels. Their attention focuses on Meadowbank School, where not only Jennifer, but also the prince's cousin, Shaista, are studying.|$|E

CAPT Kenneth Reightler, Jr. USN (Ret) (Presented 6 Aug 09) The Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) {{currently}} has no laboratory facilities {{to support the}} teaching of <b>flight</b> <b>mechanics.</b> This thesis concerns a feasibility study con- ducted to define {{the need for a}} <b>flight</b> <b>mechanics</b> laboratory at NPS, determine the methods used at other universities and availability of resources, develop a plan to integrate laboratory facilities into the NPS aeronautical engineering syllabus, and make recommendations concerning changes needed in the NPS Department of Aeronautics to enhance the teaching of <b>flight</b> <b>mechanics.</b> The general conclusion of the study is that a <b>flight</b> <b>mechanics</b> laboratory is essential to the study of <b>flight</b> <b>mechanics</b> at NPS. The proposed laboratory should include the selective use of flight simulators, computer instructional devices, a flight demonstration airplane, a fully instrumented flying laboratory, and a variable stability airplane. Extensive use should be made of contracted services. A <b>flight</b> <b>mechanics</b> laboratory used to support classroom instruction and research should be established at NPS as soon as possible.

25|$|Brabham was a Royal Australian Air Force <b>flight</b> <b>mechanic</b> {{and ran a}} small {{engineering}} workshop before he started racing midget cars in 1948. His successes with midgets in Australian and New Zealand road racing events led to his going to Britain to further his racing career. There he {{became part of the}} Cooper Car Company's racing team, building as well as racing cars. He contributed to the design of the mid-engined cars that Cooper introduced to Formula One and the Indianapolis 500, and won the Formula One world championship in 1959 and 1960. In 1962 he established his own Brabham marque with fellow Australian Ron Tauranac, which in the 1960s became the largest manufacturer of customer racing cars in the world. In the 1966 Formula One season Brabham became the first – and still the only – man to win the Formula One world championship driving one of his own cars. He was the last surviving World Champion of the 1950s.|$|E
500|$|On 12January, CIA {{spotters}} {{reported a}} four aircraft formation {{flying in the}} direction of Lima Site 85. They were Soviet-made Antonov An-2 biplanes. Two aircraft continued towards Lima Site 85, while the others turned away. The Vietnam People's Air Force, in one of its few air attacks during the conflict, tried to destroy the radar at Lima Site 85. The An-2s flew over Phou Pha Thi, and their crewmen dropped 120mm mortar shells through the aircraft's floor and then strafed their targets with 57mm rockets mounted on the wing pods. As they repeatedly attacked the facility, ground fire heavily damaged one AN-2, and it crashed into a mountainside. By now, CIA officers and U.S. controllers at Lima Site 85 had managed to contact an Air America helicopter, which was faster than the Soviet-made biplanes. The Huey pilot [...] Captain Ted Moore sighted the remaining An-2, and promptly gave chase. As he pulled alongside, <b>flight</b> <b>mechanic</b> Glenn Woods armed with an AK-47 assault rifle opened fire and caused the biplane to crash into a ridge.|$|E

2500|$|Genie was the last, {{and second}} surviving, of four {{children}} born to parents living in Arcadia, California. Her father worked in a factory as a <b>flight</b> <b>mechanic</b> during World War II and continued in aviation afterwards, and her mother, who was around 20 years younger and from an Oklahoma farming family, had come to southern California as a teenager with family friends fleeing the Dust Bowl. During her early childhood Genie's mother sustained a severe head injury in an accident, giving her lingering neurological damage that caused degenerative vision problems in one eye. Genie's father mostly grew up in orphanages in the American Pacific Northwest. [...] His father died of a lightning strike and his mother ran a brothel while only infrequently seeing him, and his mother gave him a feminine first name which made him the target of constant derision. As a result, he harbored extreme resentment towards his mother during childhood, which Genie's brother and the scientists who studied Genie believed was the root of his subsequent anger problems.|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of thrust vectoring on civil transport aircraft {{has only been}} studied by a few individuals. Quantified investigations need {{to be carried out}} to search for the potential benefits of the {{application of}} thrust vectoring control on a civil transport aircraft. Blended Wing Body configuration is a novel aircraft concept. Due to the absence of conventional tails longitudinal controllability become part of the key challenges of this configuration. It is therefore the objective of this thesis project to carry out quantified <b>flight</b> <b>mechanics</b> analyses on the effectiveness of controlling a Blended Wing Body aircraft with vectoring thrust. As a starting point <b>flight</b> <b>mechanics</b> simulations under steady level flight conditions in longitudinal plane are conducted in this project. Through this project a thrust vectoring model, which contains the calculation of nozzle deflection angles based on nozzle deflection controls and the calculation of engine thrust loss due to nozzle deflections, is developed and embedded in a <b>flight</b> <b>mechanics</b> toolbox used for the <b>flight</b> <b>mechanics</b> simulations. The <b>flight</b> <b>mechanics</b> simulations of thrust vectoring control are then carried out with a series of nozzle deflections, flight conditions, aircraft mass and CG locations. From the simulation results it is investigated that for the Blended Wing Body configuration tested in this project, thrust vectoring control under steady level flight conditions is much less effective than the conventional aerodynamic control surfaces. The maximum effectiveness ratio between thrust vectoring control and conventional aerodynamic control surfaces obtained in this project is about 11. 2 %. With extensive <b>flight</b> <b>mechanics</b> simulations, the way that aircraft flight conditions, mass and CG locations affect the effectiveness of thrust vectoring control is analysed through this project.
