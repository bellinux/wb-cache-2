5|$|After {{hearing from}} Whitlam, Kerr called Fraser. According to Fraser, Kerr asked <b>him</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he,</b> if {{commissioned}} Prime Minister, could secure supply, would immediately thereafter advise a double-dissolution election, and would refrain from new policies and {{investigations of the}} Whitlam Government pending the election. Fraser stated that he agreed. Kerr denied the exchange took place via telephone, though both men agree those questions were asked {{later in the day}} before Kerr commissioned Fraser as Prime Minister. According to Kerr, Fraser was supposed to come to Yarralumla at 1.00pm.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the detectives}} left his store that day, Gauci remembered {{something}} else. Just as the Libyan-looking customer reached the door, {{it had started}} to rain. Gauci had asked <b>him</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> also wanted to buy an umbrella, and he did. The detectives bought an identical umbrella from Gauci, took it back to Lockerbie, and searched through {{the remains of the}} black umbrellas that were found at the crash site, until they found parts of one that seemed to match Gauci's.|$|E
25|$|Bose's {{interpretation}} {{is now called}} Bose–Einstein statistics. This result derived by Bose laid the foundation of quantum statistics, and especially the revolutionary new philosophical conception of the indistinguishability of particles, as acknowledged by Einstein and Dirac. When Einstein met Bose face-to-face, he asked <b>him</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> had been aware that he had invented {{a new type of}} statistics, and he very candidly said that no, he wasn't that familiar with Boltzmann's statistics and didn't realize that he was doing the calculations differently. He was equally candid with anyone who asked.|$|E

25|$|In 1974, Bittaker {{was arrested}} for assault with attempt to commit murder. This charge arose from an {{incident}} in which he stabbed a young supermarket clerk named Gary Louie following a confrontation in a supermarket parking lot: Louie had observed Bittaker steal a steak from the supermarket in which he (Louie) worked. Upon observing Bittaker's actions, Louie had followed Bittaker into the car park and calmly asked <b>him</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> had forgotten to pay for anything. In response to this question, Bittaker stabbed Louie once in the chest, narrowly missing his heart. Bittaker attempted to flee {{the scene of the}} stabbing, but was restrained by two of Louie's fellow employees.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the prosecutor's closing argument, Judge Akubzhanov invited Chikatilo back into the courtroom, before formally asking <b>him</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> would like to make a final statement on his own behalf. In response, Chikatilo simply sat mute. Judge Akubzhanov then announced an initial date of 15 September for himself and the two official jurors to review the evidence and pass final sentence upon Chikatilo. (This date was later postponed until 14 October.) As court announced recess, the brother of Lyudmila Alekseyeva, a 17-year-old girl killed by Chikatilo in August 1984, threw a heavy chunk of metal at Chikatilo, hitting him in the chest. When security tried to arrest the young man, other victims' relatives shielded him.|$|E

25|$|Orwell married Eileen O'Shaughnessy on 9 June 1936. Shortly afterwards, the {{political}} crisis began in Spain and Orwell followed developments there closely. At {{the end of}} the year, concerned by Francisco Franco's military uprising, (supported by Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and local groups such as Falange), Orwell decided to go to Spain {{to take part in the}} Spanish Civil War on the Republican side. Under the erroneous impression that he needed papers from some left-wing organisation to cross the frontier, on John Strachey's recommendation he applied unsuccessfully to Harry Pollitt, leader of the British Communist Party. Pollitt was suspicious of Orwell's political reliability; he asked <b>him</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> would undertake to join the International Brigade and advised him to get a safe-conduct from the Spanish Embassy in Paris. Not wishing to commit himself until he had seen the situation in situ, Orwell instead used his Independent Labour Party contacts to get a letter of introduction to John McNair in Barcelona.|$|E
500|$|In his {{testimony}} {{at the court}} hearing, Clanton said Wyatt {{did not want to}} capture the men, but to kill them. Clanton told the court that Earp wanted to conceal the Earp family's involvement in the Benson stage robbery. He said Wyatt swore him to secrecy, and the next day, Morgan Earp asked <b>him</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> would make the agreement with Wyatt. He said that four or five days afterward, Morgan had confided in him that he and Wyatt had [...] "piped off $1,400 to Doc Holliday and Bill Leonard", who were supposed to be on the stage the night Bud Philpot was killed. During {{his testimony}}, Clanton told the court, [...] "I was not going {{to have anything to do}} with helping to capture—" [...] and then he corrected himself [...] "—kill Bill Leonard, Crane and Harry Head". Clanton denied having any knowledge of the Wells Fargo telegram confirming the reward money.|$|E

The president of Scientology arrives in a helicopter and talks with Stan's parents. They are opposed to Stan's participation, but the president informs them that [...] "we're not asking him to join us; we're asking him to lead us". Randy sends Stan to his room, where he finds Tom Cruise waiting. Cruise, believing that Stan is genuinely Hubbard's reincarnation, asks <b>him</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> has enjoyed his acting. When [...] "Hubbard" [...] replies that his acting is okay but not as good as others' such as Leonardo DiCaprio or the Napoleon Dynamite guy, Tom hears that he is [...] "a failure {{in the eyes of the}} prophet" [...] and locks himself in Stan's closet. He refuses to come out, despite the entreaties of Randy, Nicole Kidman, the police, Travolta and R. Kelly to [...] "come out of the closet". Travolta and Kelly eventually join Cruise in the closet.|$|E

Tom then introduces Diane's successor, Joyce Kinney. As Lois reads the newspaper, she discovers that conservative {{radio talk show host}} Rush Limbaugh is holding a book signing in Quahog, causing Brian to decide to confront Limbaugh about his political beliefs. At the signing, Limbaugh is criticized by Brian; he asks <b>him</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> has read any of his books, leaving Brian dumbfounded and angry. Brian is mugged by a gang; Limbaugh defeats them all. Thankful, Brian agrees to read Limbaugh's book, and overnight becomes a conservative Republican. Lois questions Brian's conviction, citing his past liberalism, while Brian defends his ability to change his mind based on new information. Lois mentions that Brian goes {{out of his way to}} not agree with the general consensus on many things (for example, he hated Slumdog Millionaire and Titanic but defends the movie Cocktail), and accuses him of being a [...] "contrarian" [...] rather than a genuine believer. Brian meets with Limbaugh to thank him for helping his political conversion, and the two travel to the Republican National Headquarters, where they are greeted by former President of the United States George W. Bush and United States Senator John McCain.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of May 15, Waco's {{courthouse}} quickly filled to capacity {{in anticipation of the}} trial: the crowd nearly prevented some jurors from entering. Observers also filled the sidewalks around the courthouse; over two thousand spectators were present. Attendees were almost entirely white, but a few quiet members of Waco's black community were present. As Washington was led into the courtroom, one audience member pointed a gun at him, but was quickly overpowered. As the trial commenced, the judge attempted to keep order, insisting that the audience remain silent. Jury selection proceeded quickly: the defense did not challenge any selections of the prosecution. Bernstein states that the trial had a [...] "kangaroo-court atmosphere". [...] The judge asked Washington for a plea, and explained the potential sentences. Washington muttered a response, possibly [...] "yes", interpreted by the court as a guilty plea. The prosecution described the charges, and the court heard testimony from law enforcement officers and the doctor who examined Fryer's body. The doctor discussed how Fryer died, but did not mention rape. The prosecution rested, and Washington's attorney asked <b>him</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> had committed the offense. Washington replied, [...] "That's what I done [...] " [...] and quietly apologized. The lead prosecutor addressed the courtroom and declared that the trial had been conducted fairly, prompting an ovation from the crowd. The jury was then sent to deliberate.|$|E
