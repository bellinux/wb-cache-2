500|$|On February 15 {{the session}} began at 6p.m. but Dylan simply {{sat in the}} studio working on his lyrics while the musicians played cards, napped and chatted. Finally, at 4a.m., Dylan called the musicians in and {{outlined}} {{the structure of the}} song. Dylan counted off and the musicians fell in, as he attempted his epic composition [...] "Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands". Kenny Buttrey recalled, [...] "If you notice that record, that thing after like the second chorus starts building and building like crazy, and everybody's just peaking it up 'cause we thought, Man, this is it... This is gonna be the last chorus and we've gotta put everything into it we can. And he played another harmonica solo and went back down to another verse and the dynamics had to drop back down to a verse kind of feel... After about ten minutes of this thing we're cracking up at each other, at what we were doing. I mean, we peaked <b>five</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago.</b> Where do we go from here?" [...] The finished song clocked in at 11 minutes, 23 seconds, and would occupy the entire fourth side of the album.|$|E

[...] Graham was quoted on election night saying [...] "until <b>five</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>ago,</b> I thought I was going to be premier".|$|E

6000|$|... "That's the Marie Louise, sir," [...] a seaman told me. [...] "Left here <b>five</b> {{and twenty}} <b>minutes</b> <b>ago.</b> The parties you were enquiring about boarded her right enough. The young lady had almost to be carried. She's the new turbine boat, and {{she ought to}} be across in about half an hour from now." ...|$|R
500|$|Del Toro {{acknowledged}} this message's simplicity, {{but said}} {{he would have liked to}} have seen adventure films with similar morals when he was a child. The film's ten primary characters all have [...] "little arcs" [...] conducive to this idea; del Toro stated: [...] "I think that's a great message to give kids… 'That guy you were beating the shit out of ten <b>minutes</b> <b>ago?</b> That's the guy you have to work with <b>five</b> <b>minutes</b> later.' That's life… We can only be complete when we work together." [...] The director noted that Hellboy and The Devil's Backbone told the same message, though the latter conveyed it in a very different way.|$|R

60|$|The {{dawn was}} breaking. It seemed odd {{to the king}} {{that he had been}} so long in the grave. It {{appeared}} but a few <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b> that he had descended, passed along a few steps to the place where he had peeped beyond the veil, and returned again after perhaps <b>five</b> <b>minutes</b> of that wonderful view! And what WAS it he had seen? He racked his brains to remember, but he could not call to mind a single thing! How curious everything looked too! Why, his own city, which by now he was entering, seemed changed and strange to him! The sun was already up when he turned into the palace gate and entered the public durbar hall. It was full; a chamberlain came across and asked him why he sat unbidden in the king's presence. 'But I am the king!' he cried.|$|R
