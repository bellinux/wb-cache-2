The UK had been relying on a surplus of inward investment to make up for its long-term current account deficit.

The nation's long-standing surplus in its {{trade in services}} was maintained, however, and reached a record US$231billion in 2013. In recent years, the primary economic concerns have centered on: high household debt ($11trillion, including $2.5trillion in revolving debt), high net national debt ($9trillion), high corporate debt ($9trillion), high mortgage debt (over $15trillion as of 2005 year-end), high external debt (amount owed to foreign lenders), high trade deficits, a serious deterioration in the United States net <b>international</b> <b>investment</b> <b>position</b> (NIIP) (−24% of GDP), and high unemployment.

There are more than 7,000 multinational corporations from the United States, Japan, and Europe in Singapore. There are also approximately 1,500 companies from China and a similar number from India. Foreign firms are found in almost all sectors of the country's economy. Roughly 44 percent of the Singaporean workforce is made up of non-Singaporeans. Over ten free-trade agreements have been signed with other countries and regions.

40|$|Financial {{globalisation}} has led {{to large}} increases in foreign assets and liabilities in recent decades, increasing the scope for valuation changes that are potentially greater than trade or financial flows. We confirm that the United States enjoys an ‘exorbitant privilege’ on flow income from foreign assets, which is primarily related to foreign direct investment (FDI). The geographical allocation of FDI assets explains {{only a small part}} of the US yield advantage. The key reason is that US, and also British and Japanese, investors were able to outperform the average yield earned in the countries of their FDI destinations, while most continental European investors earn the average. Further research should explore if large FDI investment in ‘tax optimisation’ countries, the improper consideration of intellectual property, or financial sophistication contributed to these high yields. For several countries, valuation changes were larger than current account and financial transactions, highlighting the importance of such changes. In the European Union, the generally negative <b>international</b> <b>investment</b> <b>positions</b> of a number of central and southern European countries were greatly supported by EU transfers. Valuation changes on net foreign assets do not look random and played an important role in the sustainability of <b>international</b> <b>investment</b> <b>positions</b> before and after the 2008 crisis. Countries with negative net <b>international</b> <b>investment</b> <b>positions</b> tend to have positive revaluation gains, while countries with large net foreign assets tend to suffer from revaluation losses. Large net foreign asset holders including China, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, Japan and Germany, suffered significant losses in 2007 - 16, helping the sustainability of the negative positions of other countries. Risk sharing was also fostered by losses suffered by the US since 2007. There is no uniform tendency in relation to the asset classes from which these losses arose. Future research should aim to better understand the drivers of these valuation changes...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{determinants}} of gross capital flows, project the size of China’s <b>international</b> <b>investment</b> <b>positions</b> in 2020 and analyse the implications for the renminbi real exchange rates. We assume in this exercise that the renminbi will have largely achieved capital account convertibility {{by the end of}} this decade, a timetable consistent with recent proposals by the People’s Bank of China. Our analysis shows that China’s gross <b>international</b> <b>investment</b> <b>positions</b> would grow significantly, and inflows and outflows would become much more balanced. The private sector would turn its net liability position into a balanced position, and the official sector would reduce its net asset position significantly, relative to the country’s GDP. Because of the increasing importance of private sector foreign claims and the decreasing importance of official foreign reserves, China would be able to earn higher net investment incomes from abroad. Overall, China would continue to be a net creditor, with the net foreign asset position as a share of GDP remaining largely stable through this decade. These findings suggest that the renminbi real exchange rate would not be particularly sensitive to capital account liberalisation as capital flows are expected to be two-sided. The renminbi real exchange rate would likely be on a path of moderate appreciation as China is expected to maintain a sizeable growt...|$|R

There is no counterpart for reserve assets in liabilities of the <b>International</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Position.</b> Usually, when the monetary authority of a country has some kind of liability, this will be included in other categories, such as Other Investments.

5000|$|The {{difference}} between a country's external financial assets and liabilities is its net <b>international</b> <b>investment</b> <b>position</b> (NIIP). A country's external debt includes both its government debt and private debt, and similarly its public and privately held (by its legal residents) external assets are also taken into account when calculating its NIIP. [...] Note that commodities, as well as currencies tend to follow cyclical patterns, whereby they undergo significant valuation changes, of which is reflected in NIIP. [...] A country's <b>international</b> <b>investment</b> <b>position</b> (IIP) is a financial statement setting out the value and composition of that country's external financial assets and liabilities. A positive NIIP value indicates a nation is a creditor nation, while a negative value indicates it is a debtor nation.
