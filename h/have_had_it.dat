25|$|The other {{exception}} {{has to do}} with {{a rather}} peculiar case of psychic phenomena, one which I find myself unable to classify.... I was brought in contact with it, in the summer of 1911, and I <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> under my observation more or less ever since, having been present at probably 250 of the night sessions, many of which have been attended by a stenographer who made voluminous notes. A thorough study of this case has convinced me that it is not one of ordinary trance.... This man is utterly unconscious, wholly oblivious to what takes place, and, unless told about it subsequently, never knows that he has been used as a sort of clearing house for the coming and going of alleged extra-planetary personalities.... Psychoanalysis, hypnotism, intensive comparison, fail to show that the written or spoken messages of this individual have origin in his own mind. Much of the material secured through this subject is quite contrary to his habits of thought, to the way in which he has been taught, and to his entire philosophy. In fact, of much that we have secured, we have failed to find anything of its nature in existence.|$|E

An example is Samuel L. Jackson's line {{toward the end of}} the film, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> with these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane!", which is replaced with [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> with these monkey-fighting snakes on this Monday-to-Friday plane!".|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} frame survived {{until the}} 19th century and was inscribed with a date {{believed to be}} 1482; 20th-century art historians suggested the number's final digit was a nine, which would give a date of 1489. In 1847 Gustav Friedrich Waagen described {{it as one of}} Memling's [...] "finest and most original works". [...] In 1902 it was exhibited in Bruges at the Exposition des primitifs flamands à Bruges, after which it underwent cleaning and restoration. Philip Lehman bought it in 1920 from the Radziwiłł family who may <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> in their family since the 16th century; Antoni Radziwiłł discovered it on a family estate in the early 19th century. At that time it had been pierced through with an arrow and required restoration.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to recording at I.D. Sound, Rundgren took an 8-track recorder and some studio equipment, installing {{it at his}} rented home on Astral Drive, Nichols Canyon. 'Intro' and 'Breathless' were recorded here, along with various guitar and keyboard overdubs. A version of 'Torch Song' was also recorded, but was scrapped due to excessive background noise. Rundgren recalled that recording at home meant he could spend time working on pieces of technology or production, such as programming a VCS3 synthesizer, at his leisure without wasting anyone else's time. The artwork on the original gatefold sleeve was also shot in this apartment. Despite working long hours each day in both I.D and at home, with minimum breaks for sleeping and eating, Rundgren said he enjoyed the recording experience, and [...] "wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> any other way." ...|$|E
500|$|Macklin, who {{conducted}} the postmortem, concluded {{that the cause of}} death was atheroma of the coronary arteries exacerbated by [...] "overstrain during a period of debility". Leonard Hussey, a veteran of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic expedition, offered to accompany the body back to Britain; while he was in Montevideo en route to England, a message was received from Emily Shackleton asking that her husband be buried in South Georgia. Hussey returned to South Georgia with the body on the steamer Woodville, and on 5 March 1922, Shackleton was buried in the Grytviken cemetery, South Georgia, after a short service in the Lutheran church, with Edward Binnie officiating. Macklin wrote in his diary: [...] "I think this is as 'the Boss' would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> himself, standing lonely in an island far from civilisation, surrounded by stormy tempestuous seas, & in the vicinity of one of his greatest exploits." ...|$|E

500|$|On Wednesday, however, The Village Voice ran {{reports of}} the riots, written by Howard Smith and Lucian Truscott, that {{included}} unflattering descriptions of the events and its participants: [...] "forces of faggotry", [...] "limp wrists", and [...] "Sunday fag follies". A mob descended upon Christopher Street once again and threatened to burn down the offices of The Village Voice. Also in the mob of between 500 and 1,000 were other groups that had had unsuccessful confrontations with the police, and were curious how the police were defeated in this situation. Another explosive street battle took place, with injuries to demonstrators and police alike, looting in local shops, and arrests of five people. The incidents on Wednesday night lasted about an hour, and were summarized by one witness: [...] "The word is out. Christopher Street shall be liberated. The fags <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> with oppression." ...|$|E

VanDerWerff said he [...] "could have done without" [...] their duet, and Futterman was even harsher: [...] "it was quite unfortunate". Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson wrote that he [...] "sort of liked" [...] how the pair were [...] "simultaneously improving upon and butchering a Taylor Swift song", and Saskin characterized it as [...] "heartfelt and passionate".|$|E
500|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the Internet buzz for {{what had been a}} minor film in their 2006 line-up, New Line Cinema ordered five days of additional shooting in early March 2006 (principal photography had wrapped in September 2005). While re-shoots normally imply problems with a film, the producers opted to add new scenes to the film to change the MPAA rating from PG-13 to R and bring it in line with growing fan expectations. The most notable addition was a revision of a catchphrase from the film that was parodied on the Internet by fans of the film, capitalizing on Samuel L. Jackson's typically foul-mouthed and violent film persona: [...] "Enough is enough! I <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> with these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane!". Subsequently, the public responded favorably to this creative change and marketing strategy, leading some members of the press to speculate that [...] "the movie has grown from something of a joke into a phenomenon".|$|E

500|$|Reprise Records, the Kinks' US label, devised an elaborate, multi-levelled promotional {{campaign}} for Arthur in early 1969. The most famous {{branch of the}} programme involved a promo package entitled God Save The Kinks. The set featured various items, including a consumer's guide to the band's albums, a bag of [...] "grass" [...] from the [...] "Daviesland village green", and an LP entitled Then, Now and Inbetween. The set {{was accompanied by a}} positive letter from Hal Halverstadt of creative services at Warner/Reprise, part of which read, [...] "... to believe that The Kinks may not <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> at all.... The Kinks are to be supported, encouraged, cheered. And saved." [...] The campaign was officially launched on 3 July, at a meeting between Ray Davies and Reprise executives in Burbank, California. Reprise considered seeding false stories in the press to create an [...] "outlaw" [...] image for the group as part of the campaign, including pieces about marijuana possession and income tax evasion. Ray called the idea [...] "mad", and the programme was dropped. Several pieces, however, were used in the press kit for Arthurs release, with titles including [...] "English Pop Group Arrested on Rape Rap".|$|E

2500|$|The nineteenth-century American {{psychologist}} and philosopher William James described the experience thus: 'From {{the way in}} which this experience is spoken of by those who <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>it,</b> it would appear to be an extremely definite and positive state of mind, coupled with a belief in the reality of its object quite as strong as any direct sensation ever gives.

The phenomenon would seem to be due to a pure conception becoming saturated with the sort of stinging urgency which ordinarily only sensations bring.'* ...|$|E
2500|$|Female {{hysteria}} {{was once}} a common medical diagnosis, reserved exclusively for women, {{that is no longer}} recognized by medical authorities as a medical disorder.

Women considered to <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> exhibited a wide array of symptoms, including faintness, nervousness, sexual desire, insomnia, fluid retention, heaviness in the abdomen, shortness of breath, irritability, loss of appetite for food or sex, and a [...] "tendency to cause trouble".|$|E
2500|$|On {{their opening}} drive, the Cowboys {{advanced}} to the Pittsburgh 38-yard line, with running back Tony Dorsett gaining 38 yards off 3 running plays. But they lost the ball on a fumbled handoff while attempting to fool the Steelers defense with a reverse-pass play. Receiver Drew Pearson later explained [...] "We practiced that play for three weeks. It is designed for me to hit Billy Joe 15 to 17 yards downfield. We practiced the play so much it was unbelievable we could fumble it. I expected the handoff a bit lower, but I should <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>it.</b> Billy Joe {{was in the process}} of breaking into the clear when the fumble occurred." [...] The play was similar to the near-turnover by Butch Johnson in the previous Super Bowl.|$|E
