Seven- to 10 -day-old chicks were treated with either a single injection of gentamicin (250 mg/kg) or noise [1500 Hz at 120 dB sound pressure level for 14 hours). A subset of the gentamicin- and noise-treated animals also received chloramphenicol [1200 mg/kg during a 24 -hour period] through a subcutaneous osmotic pump. A control group received chloramphenicol alone [1200 mg/kg during a 24 -hour period].

In this study, we investigated three FDA-approved histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (vorinostat/SAHA, belinostat, and panobinostat) as protectants against aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity in murine cochlear explants and in vivo in both guinea pigs and CBA/J mice. Individually, all three HDAC inhibitors reduced gentamicin (GM) -induced <b>hair</b> cell <b>loss</b> in a dose-dependent fashion in explants.

Mutations in mismatch repair genes, like those found in Lynch syndrome, can lead to resistance against platins, meaning that chemotherapy with platins is ineffective in people with these mutations.

40|$|AbstractCisplatin is {{a widely}} used {{anti-cancer}} drug. Ototoxicity is a major dose-limiting side-effect. A reproducible mammalian in-vitro model of cisplatin ototoxicity is required to screen and validate otoprotective drug candidates. We utilized a whole organ culture system of the postnatal mouse inner ear in a rotating wall vessel bioreactor under “simulated microgravity” culture conditions. As previously described this system allows whole organ culture of the inner ear and quantitative assessment of ototoxic effects of aminoglycoside induced <b>hair</b> cell <b>loss.</b> Here we demonstrate that this model is also applicable to the assessment of cisplatin induced ototoxicity. In this model cisplatin induced <b>hair</b> cell <b>loss</b> was dose and time dependent. Increasing exposure time of cisplatin led to decreasing EC 50 concentrations. Outer hair cells were more susceptible than inner hair cells, and hair cells in the cochlear base were more susceptible than hair cells in the cochlear apex.

Other causes include drug-induced excess of iodine, particularly from amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic medication; an excess caused by the preferential uptake of iodine by the thyroid following iodinated contrast imaging; or from pituitary adenomas which may cause an over{{production of}} thyroid stimulating hormone. Hyperthyroidism often causes a variety of non-specific symptoms including weight loss, increased appetite, insomnia, decreased tolerance of heat, tremor, palpitations, anxiety and nervousness. In some cases it can cause chest pain, diarrhoea, <b>hair</b> <b>loss</b> and muscle weakness. Such symptoms may be managed temporarily with drugs such as beta blockers.|$|E

40|$|Retrograde {{degeneration}} of {{spiral ganglion}} {{cells in the}} cochlea following <b>hair</b> cell <b>loss</b> is similar to dying back in pathology. The EFR 3 A gene has recently been discovered {{to be involved in}} the pathogenesis of dying back. The relationship of EFR 3 A and spiral ganglion degeneration, however, was rarely investigated. In this study, we destroyed the hair cells of the mouse cochlea by co-administration of kanamycin and furosemide and then investigated the EFR 3 A expression during the induced spiral ganglion cell degeneration. Our results revealed that co-administration of kanamycin and furosemide quickly induced <b>hair</b> cell <b>loss</b> in the C 57 BL/ 6 J mice and then resulted in progressive degeneration of the spiral ganglion beginning at day 5 following drug administration. The number of the spiral ganglion cells began to decrease at day 15. The expression of EFR 3 A increased remarkably in the spiral ganglion at day 5 and then decreased to near normal level within the next 10 days.

40|$|It is {{commonly}} assumed that mammalian cochlear cells do not regenerate. Therefore, if hair cells are lost following an injury, no recovery could occur.

Upon <b>hair</b> cells <b>loss,</b> those cells are able to generate new hair cells both by direct transdifferentiation or following cell cycle re-entry and differentiation.
