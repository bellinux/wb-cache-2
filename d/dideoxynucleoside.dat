40|$|Our {{previous}} studies {{suggested that the}} dNTP/dNDP transporter systems that exist in mitochondria for transporting dNTP/dNDP from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) synthesis {{play a critical role}} in delayed cytotoxicity of anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) <b>dideoxynucleoside</b> analogs in mitochondria. A protein, termed mitochondrial deoxynucleotide carrier (DNC), based on its ability to transport dNTPs in reconstituted proteoliposomes, was recently isolated. Lacking cellular information to substantiate DNC's involvement in the delayed cytotoxicity of <b>dideoxynucleoside</b> analogs, we expressed DNC and reconstituted it into proteoliposomes. The Km values for dNTPs uptake by reconstituted DNC were in the millimolar range, which is a thousandfold higher than that of the physiological level. Furthermore, we found that overexpressing DNC (wt and G 177 A-mutated DNC) in RKO cells did not sensitize the cells to the mtDNA depletion caused by β-D- 2 ′, 3 ′-dideoxycytidine (ddC), 2 ′, 3 ′-didehydro- 2 ′, 3 ′-dideoxythymidine, and 2 ′, 3 ′-dideoxyinosine or affect the mtDNA recovery rate after ddC treatment. Mitochondria isolated from DNC-overexpressing cells did not significantly differ from that isolated from RKO cells in terms of the rate of uptake or the incorporation of dTTP into mitochondria DNA. Down-regulation of DNC expression by small interfering RNA was also ineffective in changing the action of <b>dideoxynucleoside</b> analogs on the mtDNA depletion and the rate of dTTP uptake into isolated mitochondria. Down-regulation of both DNC and thymidine kinase- 2 also did not cause mtDNA depletion. We conclude that DNC does not play an important role in the delayed cytotoxicity (mtDNA depletion) of anti-HIV <b>dideoxynucleoside</b> analogs and dNTPs uptake into mitochondria. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

The higher the molecular weight range of dextran sulfate, the more potent the activity as assessed by a quantitative syncytium formation assay. Although all five HIV isolates had similar susceptibilities to the inhibitory effects of <b>dideoxynucleosides,</b> the two clinical isolates of HIV (HIV type 1 [HIV- 1] TM and SP) exhibited a pattern of reduced susceptibility to dextran sulfate {{when compared with the}} two cloned isolates (HIV- 1 WMF and HIV- 2 ROD) and a prototype laboratory strain (HIV- 1 IIIB). In combination with <b>dideoxynucleosides,</b> the high-molecular-weight range of dextran sulfate (500, 000) resulted in an antagonistic response directed against the two clinical isolates of HIV (HIV- 1 TM and SP) when the antiviral concentrations of dextran sulfate were in the ineffective range. Additive or synergistic effects were seen with the other three HIV isolates and all five HIV isolates when the low-molecular-weight range of dextran sulfate (8, 000) was used.

40|$|The {{titration}} {{curves of}} the C- 2 histidine protons of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A {{in the presence}} of several <b>dideoxynucleoside</b> monophosphates (dNpdN) were studied by means of proton nuclear magnetic resonance at 270 MHz in order to obtain information on the ligand — RNase A interaction. The changes in the chemical shift and pKs of the C- 2 proton resonances of His- 12, - 48, - 119 in the complexes RNase A — dNpdN were smaller than those previously found when the enzyme interacted with mononucleotides. The pK 2 of His- 12 was not affected by the interaction of the enzyme with these ligands, whereas, the perturbation of the pK 2 of His- 119 was clearly dependent {{on the nature of the}} ligand. If there is a pyrimidine nucleoside at the 3 ′ side of the <b>dideoxynucleoside</b> monophosphates, as in TpdA and TpT, an enhancement due to the well known interaction of the phosphate in p 1, the catalytic site, was found. However, when there is a purine nucleoside, as in dApT and dApdA, a decrease in the pK 2 value was observed and we propose that in such cases the phosphate group interacts in a secondary phosphate binding site, p 2.

In light of recent data demonstrating defects in the polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) bactericidal activity of HIV- 1 -infected patients and since many chemotherapeutic agents affect PMN function, we examined their effects on the function of PMNs from both healthy and HIV- 1 -infected individuals in vitro.

Killing of C. albicans was not affected by AZT but was enhanced by 0. 1 and 1 microM ddc (a 1 microM, killing was 26. 0 +/- 2. 02 % compared with 17. 0 +/- 0. 73 % for controls: P = 0. 006) and 0. 2 to 50 microM ddI (at 10 microM, killing was 25. 0 +/- 0. 68 % compared with 17. 8 +/- 0. 91 % for controls; P = 0. 002).

This drug concentration of AZT is approximately 100 -fold higher than the levels attained in the serum of treated patients and the levels required to inhibit HIV replication in lymphocytes.

40|$|The {{ability to}} analyze {{multiple}} polymorphic/mutation sites rapidly and accurately is pivotal {{in all areas}} of genetic analysis. We have applied single nucleotide primer extension (SNE) for detection of multiple point mutations in a micro-array format using two-color, fluorescent dye-tagged <b>dideoxynucleoside</b> triphosphate terminators (ddNTPs). The oligonucleotide primer ending one nucleotide short of the mutation site being probed is bound to the slide and single-base extended in place with two different Cy 5 /Cy 3 dye-tagged terminators using solution-phase, locus-specific, single-stranded complementary templates generated by PCR from genomic DNA. The composite fluorescence produced contains peaks of distinct wave lengths corresponding to each Cy dye-tagged terminator incorporated, resulting in a fluorescent ‘fingerprint’ for each DNA target. DNA polymerase-catalyzed incorporation of Cy dye-tagged <b>dideoxynucleoside</b> triphosphates was dependent on the particular dyes, the specific ddNTP, the DNA target concentration, sequence of the template, on-slide temperature cycling and washing conditions.

40|$|Because of the {{importance}} of macrophages in the pathogenesis of the disease caused by HIV, we investigated the efficacy of various anti-HIV drugs in human primary macrophages acutely or chronically infected by this virus.

However, in macrophages in which proviral DNA is already integrated (chronically infected macrophages), only the three inhibitors of HIV protease induced significant virus inhibition at concentrations 100 or more times higher than those effective in acutely infected macrophages.

40|$|Macrophages are now {{recognized}} {{to be important}} cellular targets in HIV infection. These cells can be infected with HIV in vitro (1 - 7) and express HIV antigens and nucleic acid in vivo (8 - 13). Macrophage-tropic forms of HIV can be isolated from brain, lung, and blood (4, 7, 14), and these isolates replicate for months in monocyte-derived macrophages in vitro (4). Unlike CD 4 T cells, macrophages are not rapidly killed by HIV and {{may serve as a}} persistent viral reservoir. HIVinfected macrophages may also have a critical role in the immunological disturbances and encephalopathy of HIV infection (15 - 17). Furthermore, cultured macrophages contain reduced levels of the kinases required to activate <b>dideoxynucleosides</b> such as AZT, and may not be protected by these agents as efficiently as T cells (18). Thus, additional therapeutic strategies for HIV infection may be needed in order to address the special biology of HIV infection in macrophages.

40|$|The {{infection}} {{and destruction of}} T lymphocytes by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been considered a central event in the pathogenesis of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (1 - 3). There is {{a growing body of}} evidence, however, that infection of cells in the monocyte/macrophage (M/M) t series by HIV may be clinically as important as that of T cells (4 - 7). Certain strains of HIV can replicate in M/M for a considerable time (> 6 mo) without necessarily inducing a substantial cytopathic effect (4, 8). Such cells may thus serve as a reservoir for dissemination of the virus to other cell types. Furthermore, HIV infection can perturb accessory cell function without killing cells (9 and Mitsuya et al., unpublished data). In addition, M/M are believed to be important target cells in the pathogenesis of AIDS-related dementias (10 - 12).

40|$|Summary: Antiviral therapy {{of human}} immundeficiency virus (HIV) {{infection}} is currently based on Inhibition of reverse transcriptase by <b>dideoxynucleosides,</b> such äs azidothymidine. Because of widespread toxicity {{it is reasonable}} to selectively target these drugs to infected cells. This may be accomplished utilizing drug-LDL conjugates, which are interüalized via cell specific receptor pathways. With respect to HIV infection, scavenger receptors of the macrophage System seems to offer a hopefull perspective. This pathway requires chemical modification of surface polarity of the LDL. Cell experiments were conducted in HepG 2 hepatocytes, which express apolipoprotein B receptors, and in P 388 macrophages, which express scavenger receptors. LDL particles to be conjugated were isolated from blood donor plasma and from LDL-apheresis waste material. Non-covalent LDL conjugation with amphiphilic nucleoside derivatives produced only an unspecific nucleoside transfer to cell membranes, due to instability of the LDL conjugates. An experimental method (coincubation test) was developed to identify those conjugates that are stable in the presence of other lipophilic compartments. Covalent coupling pf nuclepsides to the apolipoprotein B moiety of LDL particles resulted in stable conjugates. As a consequence, the surfaee Charge became negative, and the LDL displayed scavenger receptor affmity rather than apolipoprotein B receptor affinity. Selective targeting of nucleosides to macrophages can be accomplished by covalent coupling to LDL...|$|R

OBJECTIVES: The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the utility of mtDNA quantification as a marker of HIV-associated lipodystrophy as diagnosed using a published validated case definition. METHODS: We assessed mtDNA content in adipocytes from both thigh and lumbar subcutaneous adipose tissue (n= 19), and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) (n= 26), obtained from 26 HIV- 1 -infected patients classified as having lipodystrophy (n= 17) or not having lipodystrophy (n= 9) according to the validated definition derived from the Lipodystrophy Case Definition Study. RESULTS: The adipocyte and PBMC mtDNA contents did not significantly differ between patients with and without lipodystrophy. Lipodystrophy patients had been treated for significantly longer times, especially with <b>dideoxynucleoside</b> analogues. In both groups, the thigh adipocyte mtDNA content was significantly greater than that of the lumbar region. When all patients were considered together, a statistically significant negative correlation was found between thigh adipocyte mtDNA content and stavudine treatment duration. CONCLUSIONS: Longer exposure to <b>dideoxynucleoside</b> analogues was associated with lipodystrophy, and longer exposure to stavudine was correlated with lower mtDNA content in thigh adipocytes. However, a single measurement of adipocyte mtDNA content in this limited sample of patients could not distinguish between patients with and without clinical lipodystrophy.

Mean plasma RNA copy number declined from 794 +/- 274 to less than 40 (below the lower limit of sensitivity) after 1 mo of therapy, with suppression maintained after 2 mo of therapy. These results suggest that gene amplification can be used to detect and quantitate changes in plasma HIV RNA after <b>dideoxynucleoside</b> therapy.

M/M can be different from T-lymphocytes in terms of surface antigens, cell replication and drug metabolism. Thus, we evaluated, in M/M and in T-lymphocytes, the pattern of viral inhibition induced by various anti-HIV drugs, and assessed some of the mechanisms of action related to such antiviral activity. Inhibitors of HIV binding on CD 4 receptors have similar activity in M/M and T-lymphocytes, while AZT and other <b>dideoxynucleosides</b> (ddN) are in general more active against HIV in M/M than in T-lymphocytes. This phenomenon can be related to the increased ratio in M/M of ddN-triphosphate/deoxynucleoside-triphosphate, and can at least in part explain the ability of zidovudine and didanosine in improving neurological dysfunctions in AIDS patients. Moreover, the antiviral activity of AZT (but not of other ddN- or HIV-binding inhibitors) is potently enhanced by cytokines like granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in M/M, while anti-HIV activity of TIBO compounds in M/M is not down-modulated by GM-CSF and other cytokines. Finally, non-toxic concentrations of adriamycin, an anticancer drug reported to be active against DNA viruses, can inhibit HIV replication in M/M (but not in T-lymphocytes). Taken together, these results suggest that M/M are selective targets for HIV with peculiarities different from those of T-lymphocytes. Thus, promising anti-HIV compounds should be evaluated both in T-cells and in M/M before reaching clinical trials. This may help in selecting drugs with good chances of being effective in patients with HIV-related disease. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Examination of the {{anti-human}} {{immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) data of some normal and isomeric <b>dideoxynucleosides</b> (ddNs and isoddNs), their three-dimensional (3 -D) electron density patterns, their electrostatic potential surfaces (EPS), and their conformational maps reveals some interesting correlations. For example, the EPS of (S,S) -isoddA shows regions {{of high and}} low electrostatic potential remarkably similar to those of β-d- 3 ′-azido- 3 ′-deoxythymidine (β-d-AZT), (−) -oxetanocin A, and (−) -carbovir. Such correlations involving EPS data and anti-HIV activity were also found with many other active nucleosides. Conversely, inactive compounds had EPS different from those of compounds in the same series that were active. For example, apio-ddNs, which are inactive against HIV, exhibit clear differences in electrostatic potential and 3 -D electron density shape from isoddNs that are active against HIV. Additionally, the inactivity of (S,S) -isoddC and (S,S) -isoddT can be correlated convincingly with a combination of their EPS data and their conformational energy maps. The electrostatic potential distributions of active nucleoside triphosphates show remarkable correlations. For example, (S,S) -isoddATP, AZT triphosphate (AZTTP), and oxetanocin A TP have similar 3 -D electron density surface patterns and similar high and low regions of electrostatic potential, which may suggest that these compounds proceed through related mechanisms in their interactions with, and inhibition of, HIV reverse transcriptase (RT). Docking of AZTTP, (S,S) -isoddATP, and other active triphosphates into the active site of HIV RT and calculation of the EPS of both the nucleotide and the active site show that there is excellent matching between inhibitor and enzyme binding site EPS data.

40|$|AbstractMultiple {{nucleoside}} resistance involves specific mutational {{patterns of}} the HIV- 1 pol gene that are independent of the classic mutations conferring resistance to individual <b>dideoxynucleosides.</b> These include a cluster of five mutations in the reverse-transcriptase (RT) coding region (A 62 V, V 75 I, F 77 L, F 116 Y, and Q 151 M) generally referred to as multidrug resistance (MDR) mutations, and insertions of one or several amino acid residues between codons 67 and 70 of RT, a flexible region joining two antiparrallel β sheets (β 3 –β 4 insertions). The objectives {{of this study were}} (i) to determine the prevalence of multidrug resistance genotypes (MDR mutations and β 3 –β 4 insertions) in a cohort of 632 patients who were extensively pretreated with anti-HIV drugs and not responding to their current antiretroviral therapy, and (ii) to analyze the association of multidrug resistance genotypes with other resistance mutations in the RT and protease genes. Among viruses sequenced from these patients, 15 (2. 4 %) of them contained an insertion and 2 (0. 3 %) contained a deletion in the β 3 –β 4 finger subdomain of RT. In 9 cases, the insertion was associated with a D 67 S, G, or E mutation. In addition, we identified 13 (2. 1 %) viruses harboring specific MDR mutations (mainly Q 151 M and/or A 62 V, V 75 I, F 116 Y). Interestingly, the A 62 V mutation was found in 6 of the 15 strains with an insertion, whereas the other MDR mutations were not observed in insertion mutant strains. Especially high levels of resistance to zidovudine were observed for viruses with a β 3 –β 4 insertion in the background of A 62 V, L 210 W, and T 215 Y. Otherwise, MDR mutations and β 3 –β 4 insertions were found in association with the classic mutations conferring resistance to zidovudine, lamivudine, nonnucleoside RT inhibitors, and protease inhibitors, according to treatment history. Finally, we observed a genome with a deletion of codon 70 associated with a Q 151 M MDR mutation. These data suggest that the emergence of HIV- 1 multidrug resistance, which may occur in various genetic contexts, poses a challenging problem in formulating treatment strategies...|$|R
40|$|My {{search for}} a {{selective}} antiviral chemotherapy started more than 40 years ago with interferon inducers, then shifted to nucleoside analogs {{with the discovery of}} BVDU (brivudin), a highly selective anti-HSV- 1 and anti-VZV agent, and to <b>dideoxynucleoside</b> analogs such as d 4 T (stavudine), anti-HIV agents. The search culminated in the discovery of acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (ANPs) (in collaboration with Antonin Holý), a key class of compounds active against HIV, hepatitis B virus, and DNA viruses at large; the best known of these compounds is tenofovir. Along the way, the principle of the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) was established. This work, initiated in collaboration with the late Paul A. J. Janssen, eventually led to the identification of rilpivirine as perhaps an "ideal" NNRTI. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A Glu- 89 [...] >Gly {{alteration}} in {{the human}} immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase (RT) was previously shown to result in resistance to several <b>dideoxynucleoside</b> analogs and to phosphonoformic acid (PFA; foscarnet). This residue was altered to Ala, Val, Ser, Thr, Gln, Asp, Asn, or Lys, and the ddGTP and PFA sensitivities of the mutant RTs were measured. Replacements with Ala, Gly, Val, and Thr led to resistance to inhibition by ddGTP, while mutants with amino acid Ser, Gln, Asn, Asp, or Lys displayed only moderate or no resistance. A similar result was obtained with inhibition by PFA, except that the Asp- 89 mutant also displayed resistance. Furthermore, the introduction of Glu- 89 [...] >Gly alteration into the RT of human immunodeficiency virus type 2 likewise rendered it resistant to both ddGTP and PFA...|$|E
40|$|The {{sequence}} of 200 nucleotides at the 3 '-terminus {{of the genome}} RNA of vesicular stomatitis virus, Indiana serotype, was determined by adding a poly(A) tract to the 3 '-terminus of genome RNA, then using the poly(A) as a binding site for a primer to initiate reverse transcription of the RNA, and analysing the complementary DNA sequence by the <b>dideoxynucleoside</b> triphosphate chain termination method. Proceeding 3 ' to 5 ', the genome RNA sequence consisted of a sequence complementary to the leader RNA, followed by the sequence AAA, followed by a sequence complementary to the 5 '-extremity of N protein mRNA. These results are {{discussed in terms of}} leader RNA function, mechanism of transcript processing at the junction between leader RNA and N mRNA, and N mRNA structure...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} whether {{human immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) fitness was altered upon the acquisition of a set or subset of five mutations (A 62 V, V 75 I, F 77 L, F 116 Y, and Q 151 M) in the pol gene, which confers resistance to multiple <b>dideoxynucleosides</b> (MDR), {{as well as the}} zidovudine resistance-associated mutation T 215 Y, using a competitive HIV- 1 replication assay in a setting of an HXB 2 D genetic background. Target H 9 cells were exposed to a 50 : 50 mixture of paired infectious molecular clones, and HIV- 1 in the culture supernatant was transmitted to new cultures every 7 to 10 days. The polymerase-encoding region of the virus was sequenced at various time points, and the relative proportion of the two viral populations was determined. In the absence of drugs, the comparative order for replicative fitness was HIV- 162 / 75 / 77 / 116 / 151 > HIV- 177 / 116 / 151 > HIV- 1151 > wild-type HIV- 1 (HIV- 1 wt) > HIV- 175 / 77 / 116 / 151 > HIV- 1151 / 215 > HIV- 1215. In the presence of zidovudine or didanosine, the order was HIV- 162 / 75 / 77 / 116 / 151 > HIV- 177 / 116 / 151 > HIV- 175 / 77 / 116 / 151 > HIV- 1151 > HIV- 1215. HIV- 1215 S(TCC), a putative intermediate infectious clone for HIV- 1215, replicated comparably to HIV- 1 wt, while two putative intermediates for HIV- 1151 [HIV- 1151 L(CTG) and HIV- 1151 K(AAG) ] replicated much less efficiently than HIV- 1 wt and HIV- 1151, suggesting that for HIV- 1151 to develop, two base substitutions are likely to occur concurrently or within a short interval. These data may illustrate the molecular basis by which HIV- 1151 emerges much less frequently than HIV- 1215. The present data also demonstrate that several MDR HIV- 1 variants are more fit than HIV- 1 wt in the absence of drugs and that resistance-associated mutations and drug pressure are critical variates for HIV- 1 fitness...|$|R
40|$|A novel 6 -substituted acyclouridine derivative, 1 -[(2 -hydroxy-ethoxy) methyl]- 6 -phenylthiothymine (HEPT), {{has proved}} to be a potent and {{selective}} inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) in vitro. HEPT inhibits HIV- 1 replication in various T 4 cell cultures as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes and macrophages. The 50 % antiviral effective concentration for HIV- 1 (HTLV-IIIB) in MT- 4 cells is 7. 0 microM, while the 50 % cytotoxic concentration for mock-infected MT- 4 cells is 740 microM. Although HEPT is inhibitory to various strains of HIV- 1, it has no effect on the replication of other retroviruses including HIV type 2. In contrast with the <b>dideoxynucleoside</b> (i. e. azidothymidine) 5 '-triphosphates, the triphosphate of HEPT does not interact with HIV- 1 reverse transcriptase. The mechanism of action of HEPT remains subject of further study. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Experiments are {{described}} in which the feasibility of using caged dideoxy and other nucleoside triphosphate analogues for trapping breaks induced by u. v. radiation damage to mammalian cell DNA is evaluated. These nucleotide analogues that have a photolabile 1 -(2 -nitrophenyl) ethyl-protecting group attached to the gamma-phosphate are placed in situ by permeabilizing cells by exposure to hypo-osmotic medium. The nucleoside triphosphate is released from the cage by a 351 nm u. v. laser pulse whence it may incorporate in the growing chain of DNA induced by the excision-repair process and terminate chain elongation. If the photoreleased <b>dideoxynucleoside</b> triphosphate is isotopically labelled in the alpha-phosphate position the break is trapped and labelled. Incorporation of radioactivity into trichloroacetic acid insoluble material in these experiments confirms their potential for use in studies of the kinetics of mammalian cell DNA repair...|$|E
