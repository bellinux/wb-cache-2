5|$|October 21, 1950– The {{threat of}} Hurricane Love results in {{hurricane}} evacuations {{along the western}} coastline, though dry air in the storm leads to very little effects after <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> {{near the mouth of}} the Steinhatchee River.|$|E
5|$|The {{positions}} {{specific to}} punt plays are the punter (P), long snapper, and gunner. The long snapper snaps the football {{directly to the}} punter, who then drops and kicks it before <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> the ground. Gunners line up split outside the line and race down the field, aiming to tackle the punt returner (PR) – the player that catches the punt.|$|E
5|$|The girl can {{stabilize}} wobbling dishes {{by pressing}} {{the button on}} the controller. If a plate falls, the player is able to capture it if the girl touches it before <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> the ground, and a new one appears {{at the top of}} the pole. The number of poles to spin varies between the selected skill level; there are six on the easiest setting, and ten on the hardest. The player loses if they let four dishes hit the ground.|$|E

5|$|Asylum {{digitally}} created {{weapons for}} various scenes. In {{the scene in}} which Nolan is killed suddenly by {{a shot in the}} head from Jason's arrow, Asylum created the arrow in post-production. Another scene involved Jason hurling a hatchet at Lawrence as he runs away, striking him in the back. The shot of a hatchet flying through the airin one instance appearing in the same frame as the actorwould be too difficult to achieve practically. Asylum rendered a complete 3D model of the hatchet then inserted the model into the frames leading up to the frame in which <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> the character in the back. One of the final images added by Asylum was for Trent's death scene. Here, Asylum digitally created a metal spike that bursts through Trent's chest as Jason slams him onto the back of a tow truck.|$|E
5|$|Homer portrays Paul Bunyan, a great {{burden on}} the local townspeople, as he crushes their houses and greedily eats all their food. Eventually, the townspeople drug him and drag him out of their town. Out of loneliness, Bunyan carves a block of stone from the {{mountains}} into a blue ox that he calls Babe, who is rendered alive by an electric shock. In his travels with Babe, Homer creates several landmarks. Bunyan later meets a young woman, (played by Marge) and though she is initially frightened of him, the two fall in love. When a meteor is soon to hit the town, the townspeople call Paul back to help them. Paul obliges and throws the meteor towards Chicago, starting the Great Fire there, but not before <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> him in the backside.|$|E
5|$|One {{particular}} FFR attack, Poison Kiss, has her blow a large heart-shaped kiss at {{the opponent}} that travels in a sine wave path. If it connects, a quick peep show of Poison in several erotic poses is displayed, and afterwards the opponent is shown stunned with hearts dancing over their head. Defeating an opponent with this attack results in Poison doing a pole dance for her win pose, with her whip {{serving as the}} pole. Though not playable in the beta test of Capcom Fighting All Stars, promotional material released by Capcom for the title show that this move would have been retained for her gameplay. However, in Ultra Street Fighter IV, her Poison Kiss follows up with several slaps and a groin kick when <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> the opponent, similar to her Cross Art move from Street Fighter X Tekken.|$|E

5|$|Rebound is a two-player volleyball sports game {{in which}} the players, each {{controlling}} a paddle representing a person {{on either side of}} a volleyball net, attempt to score points. The horizontal paddles are moved by the players left and right on their side of the net, represented by a short dashed line. The ball, represented by a square dot, is dropped {{from the top of the}} screen in a parabolic arc; if <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> a player's paddle, it bounces in another arc according to where on the paddle it hit. Bounces from closer to the center are more vertical, while those towards the sides move mostly horizontally. This method of changing the angle of deflection is similar to the mechanics of Pong (1972), Atari's first arcade game.|$|E
5|$|As for the Street Fighter series, {{starting}} from Street Fighter X Tekken, Poison {{has a unique}} moveset of her own that mixes agile Pro Wrestling techniques and her own streetfighting abilities. Poison's standard throws include a multi-hitting slap and a Frankensteiner, Aeolus Edge and Kissed by a Goddess which are the names of her Fireball and Shoryuken-like moves, and Whip of Love which is a multi-hitting whip attack and is done {{in a similar fashion}} to Fei Long's Rekkas. Her famous flip kick from the original Final Fight games appears as a special called Love Me Tender. After the flipping axe kick, Poison can follow this move up with a reverse Frankensteiner (Poison-Rana). In addition, Poison's Super Art is called Love Storm, and starts with her charging a large version of Aeolus Edge. Once <b>it</b> <b>hits,</b> she flips into the air and lands with a hard hitting axe kick that stuns the opponent in a prone position. Afterwards, she repeatedly smacks the opponent with her horse whip and delivers a final blow that knocks them into the air. Poison also retained her signature backflip from the original game.|$|E
5|$|Gran Trak 10 is an arcade game {{developed}} by Atari through its subsidiary Cyan Engineering, and released by Atari in May 1974. In the game, a single player drives a car along a race track, viewed from above, avoiding walls of pylons {{and trying to}} pass as many checkpoints as possible before time runs out. The game is controlled with a steering wheel, accelerator and brake pedals, and a gear stick, and the car crashes and spins if <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> a pylon. Gran Trak 10 began development in fall of 1973; it was initially designed by Larry Emmons of Cyan, with the mechanical design handled by Eigen Systems, though after several design and production problems were uncovered during an initial small production run in March 1974 the design was overhauled by Allan Alcorn, the designer of Pong, with wider distribution beginning in May. The game's circuits include possibly the first instance of integrated circuit-based read-only memory, rather than graphics storied in diodes, which thereafter became the standard for arcade games.|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} innings {{of the final}} Ashes Test of 2009, Ricky Ponting faced a ball which was deflected, off something, into the wicket-keeper’s hands. The English XI appealed, and in the agonizingly long time that it took Asad Rauf to decide, Jonathan Agnew (commentating on Test Match Special) {{reasoned}} as follows: ‘Either the ball hit Ponting’s bat or <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> his pads. If <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> his bat, he is out caught behind. If <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> his pads, he is out lbw. So, either way, he is out’. Rauf, however, appeared to disagree with Agnew’s reasoning, and Ponting stayed at the wicket...|$|R

5|$|Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer {{discuss the}} {{situation}} and Kramer urges Jerry {{to do something about}} it, but Elaine argues that Rava will no longer let her edit her book if Jerry does this. Jerry calls Ray and has lunch with him, while George sits in the next booth and eavesdrops on their conversation. Jerry and George asks him about the statue, but Ray gets offended and leaves when he hears their opinion. Elaine and Rava get into an argument about Jerry's accusation, and Elaine is no longer allowed to edit Rava's book. Without notifying anybody, Kramer dresses up in Irving's old clothes and goes to Ray's apartment, pretending to be a cop, and recovers the statue, despite Ray's protests. Kramer returns the statue to a grateful George. But while George is holding the statue, Kramer gives him a friendly pat on the back, causing George to drop the statue, which breaks when <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> the floor. The episode ends without ever revealing whether or not Ray had in fact stolen the statue from Jerry's apartment.|$|E
5|$|Mulder uses a {{government}} source {{to find a}} secret T3 line in Fairfax County, Virginia, one that the AI uses to access the Internet. He also finds the trailer that {{is connected to the}} T3 line. Meanwhile, Esther forces Scully to drive to David's house. However, they find that the house has been destroyed. Esther admits that she and David had been planning to transfer their consciousness into cyberspace to enter the AI. Gelman, however, thought the idea was too dangerous. Esther also admits that she and David were in love, and were having an affair behind Gelman's back. Meanwhile, Mulder finds much computer hardware inside the trailer. He also finds David’s dead body, with a virtual reality helmet on his head. Suddenly, Mulder is constrained by moving cables and wires, and experiences a strange vision in which he is in a hospital where nurses threaten to amputate his limbs unless he reveals Kill Switch's location. Meanwhile, the AI locates Scully and Esther driving near a swing bridge. They become trapped on the bridge after the AI manipulates its drawing mechanism, causing Scully to persuade Esther to throw the laptop into the water. Just as <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> the water it is destroyed by the defense satellite's laser strike.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Mario is {{a falling}} block tile-matching video {{game in which}} Mario assumes {{the role of a}} doctor, tossing two-colored medical {{capsules}} into a medicine bottle representing the playing field. This area is populated by viruses of three colors: red, yellow, and blue, which stay in their starting position until removed. In a manner and style considered similar to Tetris, the player manipulates each capsule as it vertically falls 1 unit of space at a time, able to move it left or right and rotate it 90 degrees in either clockwise or counter-clockwise. When four or more capsule halves or viruses of matching color are aligned in vertical or horizontal configurations, they are removed from play. Any remaining capsule halves or whole capsules which are now not supported by a virus or capsule will fall {{to the bottom of the}} playing field or until <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> another supported object, and any new 4-in-a-row alignments created from this will also be removed. The main objective is to complete levels, which is accomplished by eliminating all viruses from the playing field. A game over occurs if capsules fill up the playing field in a way that obstructs the bottle's narrow neck. After each 5th level is completed on Medium or High difficulty, up to level 20, a cut-scene is shown where the virus trio is sitting on a tree as music plays and an object flies across the screen.|$|E

25|$|First, a ray {{is created}} at an {{eyepoint}} and traced through a pixel {{and into the}} scene, where <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> a diffuse surface. From that surface the algorithm recursively generates a reflection ray, which is traced through the scene, where <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> another diffuse surface. Finally, another reflection ray is generated and traced through the scene, where <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> the light source and is absorbed. The color of the pixel now depends on {{the colors of the}} first and second diffuse surface and the color of the light emitted from the light source. For example, if the light source emitted white light and the two diffuse surfaces were blue, then the resulting color of the pixel is blue.|$|E
