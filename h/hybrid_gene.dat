25|$|Mi-I (Mia), Mi-II(Vw), Mi-VII and Mi-VIII {{are carried}} on glycophorin A. Mi-I {{is due to}} a {{mutation}} at amino acid 28 (threonine to methionine: C->T at nucleotide 83) resulting in a loss of the glycosylation at the asparagine26 residue. Mi-II {{is due to a}} mutation at amino acid 28 (threonine to lysine:C->A at nucleotide 83). Similar to the case of Mi-I this mutation results in a loss of the glycosylation at the asparagine26 residue. This alteration in glycosylation is detectable by the presence of a new 32kDa glycoprotein stainable with PAS. Mi-VII is due to a double mutation in glycophorin A converting an arginine residue into a threonine residue and a tyrosine residue into a serine at the positions 49 and 52 respectively. The threonine-49 residue is glycosylated. This appears to be the origin of one of the Mi-VII specific antigens (Anek) which is known to lie between residues 40-61 of glycophorin A and comprises sialic acid residue(s) attached to O-glycosidically linked oligosaccharide(s). This also explains the loss of a high frequency antigen ((EnaKT)) found in normal glycophorin A which is located within the residues 46-56. Mi-VIII is due to a mutation at amino acid residue 49 (arginine->threonine). M-VIII shares the Anek determinant with MiVII. Mi-III, Mi-VI and Mi-X are due to rearrangements of glycophorin A and B in the order GlyA (alpha)-GlyB (delta)-GlyA (alpha). Mil-IX in contrast is a reverse alpha-delta-alpha <b>hybrid</b> <b>gene.</b> Mi-V, MiV(J.L.) and Sta are due to unequal but homologous crossing-over between alpha and delta glycophorin genes.

This system encompasses the bioinformatics analysis of mRNA, EST, cDNA, and genomic DNA sequences in the INDC databases, and can be used to identify <b>hybrid</b> <b>genes.</b> We searched for <b>hybrid</b> <b>genes</b> among the 28, 171 genes listed in the NCBI database, and analyzed their structural patterns in the human genome. The 2, 344 gene pairs were detected as hybrid forms of transcriptional products. We classified the <b>hybrid</b> <b>genes</b> into two groups: chromosomal-mediated translocation fusion transcripts and transcription-mediated fusion transcripts.

BLG-HuIFN-gamma 2 transgenic females expressed HuIFN-gamma in the milli at concentrations up to 570 mg/ml, and BLG-HuIFN-gamma 3 transgenic females expressed up to 350 mg/ml.

No significant changes were observed in the HuIFN-gamma expression level during the lactation period, Using RT-PCR analysis, ectopic expression for both <b>hybrid</b> <b>genes</b> was found in transgenic mice. Despite ectopic expression of HuIFN-gamma in transgenic mice, their development and pregnancy were normal.

5000|$|Most {{authorities}} still {{treat the}} coal tit in the subgenus Periparus, but the American Ornithologists' Union considers Periparus a distinct genus. This {{is supported by}} mtDNA cytochrome b sequence analysis; Periparus seems {{to be closer to}} the Poecile tits and chickadees than to the great tit and its relatives. Thus, it belongs to the more advanced Paridae, in which the bright plumage of the more basal lineages is dulled down apomorphically.In addition, the same data suggest that this species is paraphyletic in regard to the closely related and parapatric spot-winged tit (P. melanolophus) from South Asia, which looks like a slightly crested, darker version of P. ater. Consequently, the spot-winged tit might have to be included in P. ater, or some coal tits could be considered a distinct species. As occasional hybridization has been recorded between the two, mtDNA alone (which is inherited only from the mother) is insufficient to determine whether <b>hybrid</b> <b>gene</b> flow or another trivial cause (such as incomplete lineage sorting) obfuscates the actual relationships, or whether taxonomic rearrangement is indeed required.

40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{studies showed}} that <b>gene</b> <b>hybrid</b> {{is one of the}} {{principal}} processes for generating new genes. Although some <b>gene</b> <b>hybrid</b> events have been reported to be inter- or intra-species, there lacks a well-organized method for large scale detection of the events with multiple components. Hence in this study, we focus on building up an efficient method for exploring all candidates of <b>gene</b> <b>hybrid</b> events in human genome and provide useful results for further study. Findings We have developed a method designated Triad Comparison Algorithm (TCA) to detect all potential N -hybrid events (i. e., an N -hybrid gene and its N non-overlapping component regions derived from N different genes) in human genome. The results reveal that there are many convoluted N -hybrid events with multiple components (N > 2) and that the most complicated N -hybrid genes detected in human by TCA are composed of six component regions. Interestingly, our results show that most of the hybrid events belong to the 3 -hybrid category. Furthermore, we observe that a single gene might participate in different events. Twelve genes were found to have dual identities contained in different N -hybrid events (i. e., they were identified as <b>hybrid</b> <b>genes</b> as well as component genes). This points out that to a certain extent the <b>gene</b> <b>hybrid</b> mechanism has generated new genes during the course of human genome evolutionary history. Conclusion An efficient method, TCA, is developed for exploring all candidates of <b>hybrid</b> <b>genes</b> in the human genome and provides useful results for the evolutionary analysis. The advantage of TCA is its power of detecting any kinds of hybrid events in any species with a large genome size. </p...|$|R

Bioassays showed {{that one of these}} CryIA(b) -CryIC hybrid proteins (H 04) was highly toxic to S. exigua compared with the parental CryIA(b) protein and significantly more toxic than CryIC. In semiquantitative binding studies with biotin-labelled toxins and intact brush border membrane vesicles of S. exigua, this domain III substitution appeared not to affect binding-site specificity. However, binding to a 200 -kDa protein by CryIA(b) in preparations of solubilized and blotted brush border membrane vesicle proteins was completely abolished by the domain III substitution. A reciprocal hybrid containing domains I and II of CryIC and domain III of CryIA(b) did bind to the 200 -kDa protein, confirming that domain III of CryIA(b) was essential for this reaction. These results show that domain III of CryIC protein {{plays an important role in}} the level of toxicity to S. exigua, that substitution of domain III may be a powerful tool to increase the repertoire of available active toxins for pest insects, and that domain III is involved in binding to gut epithelium membrane proteins of S. exigua...|$|R

Cleavage-resistant mutation analysis revealed that the N-terminal portion and the last two amino acids (GG) of Ub are critical for cleavage at the junction between the two protein moieties. An apoptogenic stimulus enhances the nuclear targeting and aggregation of Ub in the nucleus, resulting in histone H 2 A deubiquitylation followed by abnormal ubiquitylation of the nuclear envelope and the lamina.

40|$|Transcripts {{from the}} Xenopus gene GS 17 are absent from oocytes and first {{appear at the}} midblastula {{transition}} (MBT), about 8 hr after fertilization. Injection experiments with deletions of the GS 17 gene and GS 17 -beta-globin <b>hybrid</b> <b>genes</b> show that a relatively short sequence of 74 base pairs is sufficient to activate, in cis, transcription at the MBT. This 74 -base sequence is located about 700 bases upstream of the GS 17 promoter and has the properties of an enhancer element...|$|R
