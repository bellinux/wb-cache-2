5|$|Before {{he worked}} for Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen in 1943, Bazna was hired to do some {{household}} and vehicle repairs for Douglas Busk, the first secretary of the British Embassy. Due to Bazna's poor English, he answered all <b>interview</b> <b>questions</b> in French. Although he supplied some written biographical information, excluding having been employed and fired by Albert Jenke, none of the biographical information was checked. Turkish secret service apparently warned the embassy at some point about Bazna. Over the few months that Bazna worked for Busk, he secretly photographed a few documents and, {{with the help of}} Mrs. Busk's nursemaid named Mara, he tried to gain access to more valuable forms of intelligence.|$|E

The course revolves around many tasks, such as reviewing literary pieces received from the genre editor, voting for or against a piece being published in the upcoming issue, or even preparing <b>interview</b> <b>questions</b> for the authors of accepted pieces. Students are able to serve in one of the three genres: fiction, nonfiction, and poetry.|$|E
500|$|The philosopher Frederick Suppe {{considered}} Sexual Preference a {{very important}} study that failed to duplicate the findings of Bieber et al. or the predictions of symbolic interactionism, labeling theory, and societal reaction theory approaches. Suppe considered Bell et al.′s sample of homosexuals, while highly biased, to nevertheless be the most representative ever made, and argued that biased samples can be adequate {{for the purposes of}} refuting theories propounded in other studies [...] "so long as the types of subjects used in those other studies constitute a subsample of the replicative study′s sample and the latter's population does not go beyond the claimed scope of the replicated studies." [...] He maintained that Bell et al.′s study meets these requirements, that their use of path analysis was appropriate, and that their procedures for developing a composite etiology model, which contained [...] "virtually all paths advanced in the literature", are legitimate. He argued that the only plausible basis for disputing that the study definitively refutes [...] "social learning theories of homosexual etiology" [...] is to challenge the adequacy of Bell et al.′s models and the questions they used. However, he questioned some of the details of Bell et al.′s methodology, including the questions asked. He wrote that while Bell et al. did not use the same specific questions that Bieber et al. employed, they did use [...] "questions directed at the same concerns." [...] He noted that Bell et al.′s data regarding subjects′ negative feelings toward and relationships with their fathers were based on open-ended <b>interview</b> <b>questions,</b> adding {{that it would have been}} preferable had they employed the same [...] "structured-answer questions" [...] used in Bieber et al.′s earlier study. He rejected Bell et al.′s claim that their study supports a biological explanation of sexual orientation. He wrote that since Bell et al.′s study, research into the [...] "social causes of homosexuality" [...] has become [...] "moribund." ...|$|E

2500|$|The series gave early {{exposure}} to, {{and generated}} breakthrough Australian hits for, international artists including ABBA, Meat Loaf, Blondie, Boz Scaggs, Cyndi Lauper, Madonna and Michael Jackson; sometimes {{years before they}} became international stars. Meldrum made overseas trips and formed friendships with many artists, enabling Countdown to gain international exclusives. His on-screen performances were sometimes criticised for rambling and incomprehensible commentaries or <b>interview</b> <b>questions.</b> When providing an album review he would often hold the album awkwardly {{in front of the}} cameras with lights glaring off its surface making it difficult to see. In an early [...] "Humdrum" [...] segment, Meldrum told viewers to [...] "Go out and buy it" [...] when reviewing an album.
