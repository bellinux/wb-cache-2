500|$|The {{musical score}} for Girl with a Pearl Earring {{was written by}} the French {{composer}} Alexandre Desplat. Webber decided to hire Desplat after hearing a score he had composed for a Jacques Audiard film. Webber explained, [...] "He {{had a sense of}} restraint and a sense of lyricism that I liked. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> I saw the cue where Griet opens the shutters. He was really describing what the light was doing, articulating that in a musical sphere." [...] Desplat was then known primarily for scoring films in his native language.|$|E
2500|$|In the film, Emin {{describes}} leaving {{school at}} age 13 and spending her time on Margate's Golden Mile, dreaming and having sex. Sex [...] "was {{something you could}} just do and it was for free". She was [...] "13, 14" [...] and having sex with men of [...] "19, 20, 25, 26". In the film, the narration states: “It could be good, really something. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> someone asked me to grab their balls, I remember the power it gave me. But it wasn’t always like that; sometimes they’d just cum, and then they’d leave me there, wherever I was, half naked.” In the final scenes, the artist performs at a local dance competition and people begin to clap. A gang of men, “most of whom [...] had sex with {{at one time or}} another" [...] began to chant [...] "slag, slag, slag".|$|E

I had set out from Montreal with two trappers to {{pay a visit to}} the Labrador coast; we had travelled most of the way in a small Indian canoe, coasting along the northern shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and reconnoitring in the woods for portages to avoid rounding long capes and points of land, and sometimes in search of game; for we depended almost entirely upon our guns for food.|$|E
5000|$|Lead singer Jaren Johnston, {{who wrote}} the song, told Billboard: [...] "I wanted {{something}} for our live set that mirrored 'Kashmir' by Led Zeppelin - maybe a southern version of that.

60|$|By {{very slow}} degrees, and with {{frequent}} relapses that alarmed and grieved my friend, I recovered. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> I became capable of observing outward objects {{with any kind}} of pleasure, I perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window. It was a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence. I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in my bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion.|$|E
60|$|Well do <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in my waking {{life that}} I saw an oak tree. As I {{looked at the}} leaves and {{branches}} and gnarls, {{it came to me}} with distressing vividness that I had seen that same kind of tree many and countless times in my sleep. So I was not surprised, still later on in my life, to recognize instantly, the first time I saw them, trees such as the spruce, the yew, the birch, and the laurel. I had seen them all before, and was seeing them even then, every night, in my sleep.|$|E
6000|$|There are, it is true, a few {{classes that}} have escaped this contagion, shepherds {{living in the}} hills, drovers, sailors, {{fishermen}} and such like. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> I went into the English country-side being struck with the clean, honest look in the people's faces. I realised exactly where they got it: {{they had never seen}} any Americans. I remember speaking to an aged peasant down in Somerset. [...] "Have you ever seen any Americans?" [...] "Nah," [...] he said, [...] "uz eeard a mowt o' 'em, zir, but uz zeen nowt o' 'em." [...] It was clear that the noble fellow was quite undamaged by American contact.|$|E

We talked in whispers not because there was any one to hear, but because there was still such a freshness of mind between us that our thoughts were a little frightened, I think, to find themselves at last in words. And so they went softly.|$|R
5000|$|Frank Zappa paid this tribute: [...] "Tom Wilson {{was a great}} guy. He had vision, you know? And {{he really}} stood by us ... <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> thing that we {{recorded}} was 'Any Way the Wind Blows,' and that was okay. Then we did 'Who Are the Brain Police?' and I saw him through the glass {{and he was on}} the phone immediately to New York going, 'I don't know!'

60|$|On a Sunday {{night in}} June, {{following}} a day during which victory seemed more distant than ever, with startling unexpectedness Maude capitulated. She sat beside {{me on the}} bench, obscured, yet the warm night quivered with her presence. I felt her tremble.... <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> exquisite touch of her soft cheek. How strange it was that in conquest the tumult of my being should be stilled, that my passion should be transmuted into awe that thrilled yet disquieted! What had I done? It was as though I had suddenly entered an unimagined sanctuary filled with holy flame....|$|R

That was before your time, Roberts. I was sleeping at Dutch Henry's hotel, down where the market is now. Ever heard of him? He made a tidy stake smuggling arms in to the rebels, sold out his hotel, and was killed in Sydney just six weeks afterward in a saloon row.|$|E

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> {{they gave}} me the jacket down in the dungeons.

Yes, and my jute-sacking was far above the average demanded. I was sent to the jacket that first time, according to the prison books, because of [...] "skips" [...] and [...] "breaks" [...] in the cloth, in short, because my work was defective. Of course this was ridiculous. In truth, I was sent to the jacket because I, a new convict, a master of efficiency, a trained expert in the elimination of waste motion, had elected to tell the stupid head weaver a few things he did not know about his business. And the head weaver, with Captain Jamie present, had me called to the table where atrocious weaving, such as could never have gone through my loom, was exhibited against me. Three times was I thus called to the table. The third calling meant punishment according to the loom-room rules. My punishment was twenty-four hours in the jacket.|$|E

Abroad woman is always where man ought to be, and man where most ladies would prefer to meet with women. The ladies garde- robe is superintended by a superannuated sergeant of artillery. When I want to curl my moustache, say, I have to make application to a superb golden-haired creature, who stands by and watches me with an interested smile. I would be much happier waited on by the superannuated sergeant, and my wife tells me she could very well spare him.

6000|$|I have arrived, as you see, without accident; but I {{never had}} a more wretched journey in my life. I could not settle to read anything; I bought Darwin's last book in despair, for I knew I could {{generally}} read Darwin, {{but it was a}} failure. However, the book served me in good stead; for when a couple of children got in at Newcastle, I struck up a great friendship with them on the strength of the illustrations. These two children (a girl of nine and a boy of six) had never before travelled in a railway, so that everything was a glory to them, and they were never tired of watching the telegraph posts and trees and hedges go racing past us to the tail of the train; and the girl I found quite entered into the most daring personifications that I could make. A little way on, about Alnmouth, they had their first sight of the sea; and it was wonderful how loath they were to believe that what they saw was water; indeed it was very still and grey and solid-looking under a sky to match. It was worth the fare, yet a little farther on, to see the delight of the girl when she passed into [...] "another country," [...] with the black Tweed under our feet, crossed by the lamps of the passenger bridge. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> I had gone into [...] "another country," [...] over the same river from the other side.|$|E
