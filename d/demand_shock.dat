25|$|Goldman Sachs' {{entry into}} the {{commodities}} market via the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index has been implicated by some in the 2007–2008 world food price crisis. In a 2010 article in Harper's magazine, Frederick Kaufman accused Goldman Sachs of profiting while many people went hungry or even starved. He argued that Goldman's large purchases of long-options on wheat futures created a <b>demand</b> <b>shock</b> in the wheat market, which disturbed the normal relationship between supply and demand and price levels. He argues that {{the result was a}} 'contango' wheat market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which caused prices of wheat to rise much higher than normal, defeating the purpose of the exchanges (price stabilization) in the first place. however, a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development – using data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission – showed tracking funds (of which Goldman Sachs Commodity Index was one) did not cause the bubble. For example, the report points out that even commodities without futures markets also saw price rises during the period. Some commodities without futures markets saw their prices rise {{as a consequence of the}} rising prices of commodities with futures markets: the World Development Movement states there is strong evidence that the rising price of wheat caused the price of rice to subsequently rise as well.|$|E

Furthermore, Howard Qi argues that the education in the US is not conducive to producing high quality scientists and engineers from the American citizens. Instead, the US is becoming increasingly and vitally relying on foreign students in the US universities to support the intellectual need in the US's science and engineering.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{investigation}} is on the cyclical response of the real wage to <b>demand</b> <b>shocks.</b> This response differentiates the empirical validity of major New Keynesian explanations of business cycles. The empirical evidence, across industrial countries, highlights a moderate positive correlation between nominal wage and price flexibility in response to various <b>demand</b> <b>shocks.</b> Nonetheless, higher price flexibility moderates the effect of <b>demand</b> <b>shocks</b> on real output, while higher nominal wage flexibility increases, or does not determine, the effects of <b>demand</b> <b>shocks</b> on real output across countries. An increase in {{the response of the}} real wage to <b>demand</b> <b>shocks</b> therefore exacerbates their real effect on output, as predicted by sticky-price models. Further, <b>demand</b> <b>shocks</b> do not determine the difference in wage variability. Nominal wage variability increases, in turn, output variability across countries. In contrast, <b>demand</b> <b>shocks</b> differentiate price variability. Price variability moderates, in turn, output variability across countries. business cycles, sticky-wage, sticky-price, asymmetry, real wage; cyclicality, growth, inflation...|$|R

Unexpected disruptions of oil supply act mainly as negative supply shocks for oil- intensive industries and act mainly as negative <b>demand</b> <b>shocks</b> for less oil- intensive industries. For most industries in the U.

40|$|We {{document}} how <b>demand</b> <b>shocks</b> in {{export markets}} lead French multi-product exporters to re-allocate {{the mix of}} products sold in those destinations. In response to positive <b>demand</b> <b>shocks,</b> those French firms skew their export sales towards their best performing products; and also extend the range of products sold to that market. We develop a theoretical model of multiproduct firms and derive the specific demand and cost conditions needed to generate these product-mix reallocations. Our theoretical model highlights how {{the increased competition from}} <b>demand</b> <b>shocks</b> in export markets - and the induced product mix reallocations - induce productivity changes within the firm. We then empirically test for this connection between the <b>demand</b> <b>shocks</b> and the productivity of multi-product firms exporting to those destinations.

50|$|A {{positive}} <b>demand</b> <b>shock</b> increases {{demand and}} a negative <b>demand</b> <b>shock</b> decreases demand. Prices {{of goods and}} services are affected in both cases. When demand for a good or service increases, its price typically increases because of a shift in the demand curve to the right. When demand decreases, its price typically decreases because of a shift in the demand curve to the left. Demand shocks can originate from changes in things such as tax rates, money supply, and government spending. For example, taxpayers owe the government less money after a tax cut, thereby freeing up more money available for personal spending. When the taxpayers use the money to purchase goods and services, their prices go up.|$|E

40|$|A major aim {{of recent}} {{empirical}} modelling {{of the business}} cycle is to identify {{the relative importance of}} aggregate supply and <b>demand</b> <b>shocks.</b> Supply or technology shocks are associated with permanent (structural) effects on economic activity whereas <b>demand</b> <b>shocks</b> are related to temporary (cyclical) effects. Most studies in this vein use multivariate VAR ­models or the common trends- cointegration approach in order to disentangle supply and <b>demand</b> <b>shocks.</b> As an alternative, this paper uses the methodology of unobserved (or structural) components time series models as set out in Harvey (1989) for identification of technology and <b>demand</b> <b>shocks</b> in a two equation system of labour productivity and industrial output. The novelty is the introduction of correlation between the two types of shocks such that the mutual dependency of these shocks can be estimated explicitly. This is because technology shocks will have cyclical (temporary) effects, and <b>demand</b> <b>shocks</b> will have structural (permanent) effects, which are not fully described by the interaction of the endogenous variables in the model. The estimation procedure is set out in Koopman et al. (1995). The data is quarterly time series of labour productivity and industrial output for France, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States. Our results show that the covariance of the dynamics of supply and <b>demand</b> <b>shocks</b> appears to be important in these countries. It indicates a good coordination is needed between structural and cyclical policies. Time series models; Supply and <b>demand</b> <b>shocks...</b>|$|R

30|$|Aggregate <b>demand</b> <b>shocks</b> have {{negative}} and statistically significant impacts on exchange rate returns in oil-exporting countries (Canada and the UK) at three lower quantiles, which implies that positive aggregate <b>demand</b> <b>shocks</b> bring about {{an appreciation of}} the local currency relative to the US dollar. The aggregate <b>demand</b> <b>shocks</b> have statistically significant effects on exchange rate returns in oil-importing countries at the 0.01 quantile. For Japan and the European Union, the shock effects are negative, whereas for Australia they are positive. Aggregate <b>demand</b> <b>shocks</b> reflect typical short-run macroeconomic multiplier effects over the business cycle from aggregate demand stimulation. A global aggregate demand-driven shock would affect oil-exporting countries’ currencies both through a change in the oil price and through a change in demand for other goods they export. Therefore, the aggregate <b>demand</b> <b>shocks</b> lead to a negative impact (US dollar depreciation) on exchange rate returns in oil-exporting countries. However, for oil-importing countries, the impact on the effective exchange rate may differ due to compensatory effects through trade and asset channels vis-à-vis other main trading partners.|$|R
