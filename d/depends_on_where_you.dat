40|$|The {{question}} posed {{in this article}} is how parliamentary position affects the attitudes of political representatives: Do attitudes towards democratic game rules and policy content differ between members of the ruling majority and the opposition? And if there is such an effect, what could be the possible causal mechanisms? The data derive from a unique survey of all 13, 044 councillors in the 290 municipalities in Sweden. The results show that, within all political parties, opposition members are more positive towards participatory democracy, while majority members favour representative democracy.

It was hypothesised that discourses on interracial intimate relationships in post-apartheid South Africa would intersect with racist and/or antiracist discourses. This study sought to identify and explore discourses on these relationships, and to investigate the possible intersections with discourses on racism. Thompson’s method of depth hermeneutics (of which critical discourse analysis was a component) was employed to analyse data generated by two focus group discussions and two interviews with interracial couples.

The three main discursive themes were on race, whiteness, and interracial intimate relationships, with the latter theme dominating. Of particular significance was how discursive strategies were employed in order to deny, negate and justify racism. The most striking findings relate to how discourses on interracial relationships intersect with discourses on three main themes: i) experimentation, as depicted by discourses on developmental psychology, ii) geographical locations, socio-economic status, and class, as manifested in the discourse of “It <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> go”, and iii) the ideological construction of the family, which functions to maintain a racially stratified society that maintains the status quo...|$|E

40|$|The science, technology, engineering, and {{mathematics}} (STEM) workforce {{is a crucial}} driver of the U. S. economy. Over the last decade, there has been significant concern regarding {{the adequacy of the}} supply of STEM workers {{to meet the demands of}} the market. At the same time, many experts have presented evidence that there is a surplus of STEM workers. This thesis tries to reconcile the "STEM Crisis" vs. "STEM Surplus" debate by examining the heterogeneity of the supply and demand for the STEM workforce. The taxicab queueing model is presented as a frameworking metaphor to better understand the variation across different job segments, degree levels, and regions as well as illuminate the probabilistic nature of supply and demand markets. An analysis of the STEM labor market is conducted using an in-depth literature review using available data sources in conjunction with informal sources such as newspaper articles and interviews with company recruiters. Findings indicate that there is significant heterogeneity in the STEM labor market. The academic sector is generally oversupplied. The government sector has shortages in specific areas such as doctorates in nuclear engineering, materials science, and electrical engineering, as well as cybersecurity and intelligence professionals. The private sector also has specific shortages for positions such as petroleum engineers, data scientists, and software developers. At the same time, there are surpluses for graduates in areas like chemistry arid physics. The demand and supply also varies according to location and U. S. citizenship.

40|$|Interregional {{relationships}} {{at close}} and long range have occupied more of archaeologists' attention in Central America than, for example, in Mesoamerica or the Andes. As a result {{we now have}} a considerable amount of detailed information demonstrating the existence of interregional contacts, both within the isthmus and with regions outside of it. The actual impact that interregional relationships had on the processes of social change in Central America, however, has remained an open question. While some argue strongly that these processes of social change were strongly affected by interregional relationships, others argue that the sociopolitical impact of these contacts was weak, and that much more local factors carried more weight in the processes of social change. I grouped different models of social change into three families according to where the primary source of social change is located. The first family of models emphasizes the internal conditions within a local region as the major stimulus for cultural change. The second family of models emphasizes dynamic relationships between neighboring regions. The third family of models emphasizes interaction across macroregions. Thus, the research presented here aimed to help evaluate how important interregional relationships were in the dynamic of social change in Central America. Archaeological work done in several regions in Costa Rica has provided us with basic information about their sociopolitical development. Regional settlement study in San Ramón de Alajuela documented another trajectory to add to the comparison. Taken together, the results show that while in some cases interregional relationships were related to sociopolitical events happening in the participating regions, in other cases this did not happen. While some interregional relationships were very specific in other cases they seem to have been more all-inclusive. While some regions were integrated in networks of interregional exchange, these transactions had little impact on sociopolitical events. Furthermore, all of the above also varied substantially through time. Thus, as is common in social sciences, the question of whether interregional relationships were important in pre-Columbian social change does not have a binary yes or no answer, but instead it <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> look and when...|$|E

The fraction of people in rural Orissa with access to medical facilities in their village in 1981 was less than 11 % compared to 96 % in Kerala. In 1991, 93 % of villages in Kerala had a middle school but the corresponding fraction in Orissa and Assam was less than 25 % and in UP it was less than 15 %. What is less often emphasized but equally striking is the extent of variation within a single state: According to the 1991 census, less than 7 % of the villages in Vishakhapatnam district in Andhra Pradesh had middle schools and just over 46 % had some educational facility, as against 55 % and 100 % in Guntur.

40|$|Sorry, {{the full}} text of this article is not {{available}} in Huskie Commons. Please click on the alternative location to access it. 404 p. The purpose of this dissertation is to study Thai foreign policy under the Kukrit Pramoj Government. It focuses on two major foreign policy decisions [...] the decision to seek the complete withdrawal of American forces from Thailand in 1976 and the decision to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1975. During his short term in office (March 1975 to April 1976) Prime Minister Kukrit refocused Thai foreign policy to take account of the rapidly changing situation both internally and in Southeast Asia as a whole. The central theme {{of this study is to}} apply the decision-making approach of Graham T. Allison to the two foreign policy decisions examined. The Kukrit Government's decision on the American troop withdrawal was based on a combination of Allison's Models II and III: the interplay between organizational process factors and bureaucratic politics. However, the evidence from interview responses and related materials was not conclusive and did not clearly reflect bureaucratic maneuvering and bargaining between the Thai military and civilians. The decision appeared to be determined essentially by internal and external pressures. The actions taken were the result of logical and rational choices of the Kukrit Government which seems best explained by Allison's Model I. In the process of implementation of the American troop withdrawal, particularly in the Ramasoon Case where non-combat troops were involved, a conflict of opinion occurred within the circle of key decision-makers and concerned organizations. They maneuvered to achieve their desired results according to their organizational preferences. The maneuvers involved the seven principles drafted by the Thai Foreign Ministry, the status of the technicians, and the withdrawal deadline. The military and the civilians could not agree on these issues and they tended to justify their stances according to their organizational interests. In this case, it is apparent that organizational position determined policy stance, or to use Allison's well-known aphorism [...] where you stand <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> sit. Accordingly, the implementation process of the Ramasoon Case combined both organizational process factors and bureaucratic politics. The Kukrit Government's decision to establish diplomatic relations with the PRC was hypothesized as a result of a long conflict of organizational interests and varying perceptions between the Ministries of Defense and Foreign Affairs. This hypothesis was validated during the initial phase of its formulation process preceding the events of October 1973 when the Thai military government still played a dominant role in matters of national security policy. This was the case when Foreign Minister Thanat began to talk about a gradual rapprochement with Peking and the Thai military did not support his move and even dismissed him from his Cabinet post following the 1971 coup. However in the later phase when the Kukrit Government made the decision to establish diplomatic relations with the PRC, the decision-making process did not result from a long conflict of organizational interests and varying perceptions of key decision-makers between the military and the Foreign Ministry or from organizational action and output. The decision was in fact made in a similar manner to that of the American combat troop withdrawal, i. e., as a response to changes both within and outside the country. The decision, then, more closely followed the explanation of Allison's Model I. The cases under study show that rational policy is still relevant for providing a more complete and meaningful explanation for the study of Thai foreign policy. Therefore, in applying Allison's decision-making approach to the Thai context, the researcher acknowledges that the models are not mutually exclusive; it is conceivable that a thorough policy analysis would have to employ elements of each of Allison's three models...|$|E
