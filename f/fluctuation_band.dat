In contrast, we try to to provide some additional evidence making use of a wider set of credibility indicators, including the marginal credibility that has not been examined before for the Irish case. At the same time, we extend the analysis by considering in our sample the more recent events in the EMS history, particularly the broadening of <b>fluctuation</b> <b>bands</b> in 1993.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{analyses}} some of {{the economic}} issues related to Romania's ability to meet the Maastricht exchange rate criterion. Based {{on the experience of}} the countries which had already joined Euro zone, we identified that, beyond the standard <b>fluctuation</b> <b>band</b> of ± 15 % officially required by ERMII, there is a strong preference for maintaining the exchange rate within a narrow band, with an upper margin of maximum + 10 percent over the central rate. On this background, a hypothetical participation of Romanian leu in ERM-II over two-year period is assessed using the framework developed by the European Central Bank and the European Commission. Simulations performed on daily data series for the last 24 months indicate that the nominal exchange rate of RON was relatively stable within the standard <b>fluctuation</b> <b>band.</b> Nevertheless, it significantly deviated from the pattern exhibited by the currencies that had fulfilled this criterion. Downwards pressures that characterized the developments of Romanian leu as well as the spikes in volatility of the exchange rate could signal an intensity of tensions inconsistent with the above mentioned criterion...|$|E

The authors find that the implications of available models are inconsistent with European exchange-rate data, and they suggest that the frequent realignments occurring in the period they consider may be responsible for this. They construct a model in which the likelihood of a realignment in the near future increases as the exchange rate approaches the limits of its <b>fluctuation</b> <b>band</b> and show that its implications are broadly consistent with the evidence.

Mean reversion is significant even when volatility is high in ERM- 6, unlike central bank intervention, which almost disappears in ERM_ 15.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{determinants}} of expected rates of realignment of the French franc/Deutsche mark exchange rate during the period 1987 - 1991. It does so by first estimating expected parity changes and then relating these to economic variables that are believed to influence agents’ realignment expectations. Time-varying expected rates of realignment are estimated in two ways: one, by adjusting short-term euromarket interest rate differentials for the expected rate of change of the FF/DM exchange rate within the EMS <b>fluctuation</b> <b>band</b> and two, by the differential in the yield on long-term government bonds. The behavior of the exchange rate within the band {{is found to be}} consistent with mean reversion and the expected change is nontrivial. Thus, by filtering out the expected mean reversion within the band from short-term interest rate differentials more precise measures of expected changes in the central parity are obtained. Realignment expectations are found to be closely related to the evolution of fundamental economic variables and, for shorter horizons, the position of the franc in the <b>fluctuation</b> <b>band.</b> Interest rate differential;Exchange rate realignments;European Monetary System;exchange rate, statistics, rate of change, foreign exchange, equation, exchange rates, financial statistics, foreign exchange reserves, equations, exchange rate band, standard errors, statistical significance, exchange reserves, exchange rate mechanism, exchange rate bands, forward exchange rate, standard error, dummy variable, forward exchange, statistic, exchange rate changes, exchange risk, probability, foreign exchange risk, spot exchange rate, constant term, cointegration, covariance, exchange rate uncertainty, estimation of equation, autocorrelation, estimation procedure, sampling, fluctuations in exchange rates, logarithms, explanatory power, hard currency, exchange rate policy, empirical method, exchange rate target, exchange rate expectations, fixed exchange rate, current exchange rate, exchange rate risks, exchange rate target zones, real exchange rate, random walk...|$|E
