On phytosociolgical analyses, these fitocoenoses {{have been attributed}} to the new association Ilici aquifolii-Quercetum cerridis, within the order Doronico orientalis-Fagion sylvaticae, vicarious of Ilici-Quercetum austrothyrrenicae described from the Madonie Mountains...|$|R

5000|$|The {{scientific}} name heterophyllus, [...] "different leaves", {{refers to the}} variation in leaf shape between spiny and entire. The common name holly osmanthus refers to the similarity in leaf shape {{to that of the}} holly (<b>Ilex</b> <b>aquifolium),</b> an example of convergent evolution with a common objective of deterring browsing; the two may be distinguished easily by the leaf arrangement, alternate in <b>Ilex</b> <b>aquifolium</b> and opposite in Osmanthus heterophyllus.|$|R
50|$|The larvae {{probably}} feed on Ilex species (including Ilex triflora). In captivity, larvae {{have been}} reared on leaves of <b>Ilex</b> <b>aquifolium.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Ilex</b> <b>aquifolium</b> {{was once}} among the {{traditional}} woods for Great Highland bagpipes before tastes turned to imported dense tropical woods such as cocuswood, ebony, and African blackwood.|$|R
50|$|Underneath {{these trees}} are planted {{a number of}} shrubs, most noticeably laurels (Aucuba japonica) and hollies (such as <b>Ilex</b> <b>aquifolium),</b> and several camellias (Camellia japonica) and a Fatsia japonica.|$|R
50|$|The hybrid holly Ilex x altaclerensis (Highclere holly) was {{developed}} here in about 1835 by hybridising the Madeiran Ilex perado (grown in a greenhouse) {{with the local}} native <b>Ilex</b> <b>aquifolium.</b>|$|R
50|$|The holly {{leaf miner}} is found {{throughout}} the holarctic on its host <b>Ilex</b> <b>aquifolium.</b> It is common and widespread in Europe and has been introduced into western Canada and north west USA.|$|R
50|$|The {{evergreen}} holly <b>Ilex</b> <b>aquifolium</b> {{plant has}} been used a pub sign since Roman times and thus became a popular name for inns {{such as the one}} that Hollybush station is named from.|$|R
50|$|The holly blue has pale silver-blue wings {{spotted with}} pale ivory dots. In Europe, the first {{generation}} feeds mainly on the holly species <b>Ilex</b> <b>aquifolium</b> but the second generation uses a range of food plants.|$|R
50|$|On more acid soils, sessile oak, Quercus petraea, and birch, Betula sp., are dominant. The under-storey, of hazel, holly, <b>Ilex</b> <b>aquifolium,</b> rowan, Sorbus aucuparia, and hawthorn, Crataegus monogyna, is sparse and the ground-cover is {{relatively}} poor.|$|R

50|$|In Europe {{the genus}} is {{represented}} by a single species, the classically named holly <b>Ilex</b> <b>aquifolium,</b> and in continental Africa by this species and (Ilex mitis). Ilex canariensis, from Macaronesia, and <b>Ilex</b> <b>aquifolium</b> arose from a common ancestor in the laurel forests of the Mediterranean. Australia, isolated at an early period, has (Ilex arnhemensis). Of 204 species growing in China, 149 species are endemic. A species which stands out for its economic importance in Spanish-speaking countries is Ilex paraguariensis or Yerba mate. Having evolved numerous species that are endemic to islands and small mountain ranges, and being highly useful plants, many hollies are now becoming rare.|$|R

40|$|According {{to several}} authors an old-growth forest in Italy {{is a natural}} forest in which human {{disturbance}} is absent or negligible, and in which natural dynamics create a mosaic of all the forest regeneration phases, including the senescing one. Such phase is characterized by large old trees, deadwood (snags logs and coarse woody debris) and a vascular plant species composition {{that is consistent with}} the bio-geographical context and it includes highly specialized taxa related to the small-scale disturbance and the microhabitats resulting from structural heterogeneity. Unmanaged forests are the main refugee for rare and endangered species, including fungi. In Sicily, 472 hectares were recognized as old-growth forests, mainly distributed in regional natural parks, reserves, Site of Community Importance (SCI) and, Special Protection Areas (SPA). Investigation was carried out in “Bosco Pomieri”, an old-growth forest included in the Madonie Park (Northern Sicily). In 2013, a multidisciplinary research team started to evaluate vascular plant and cryptogam diversity, and also carried out plant physiology tests and environmental monitoring. The “Bosco Pomieri” is a mixed oak wood characterized by the presence of many old trees of Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl. subsp. austrothyrrenica Brullo, Guarino & Siracusa and a dense shrub layer with <b>Ilex</b> <b>aquifolium</b> L. The <b>forest</b> area is also characterized by Fagus sylvatica L., Acer pseudoplatanus L., A. obtusatum W. & K., Ulmus glabra Huds., Sorbus torminalis L., Malus sylvestris (L.) Mill., and, sporadically, Quercus cerris L. and Q. pubescens s. l. Shrubby species, such as Daphne laureola L., Crataegus laciniata Ucria, Ruscus aculeatus L. and, Rhamnus catharticus L., are also included in the investigated area. Fungi are currently represented by 62 saprotrophs and mycorrhizal species (59 Basidiomycetes and 3 Ascomycetes) belonging to 34 genera of 21 families. The most represented genera are Boletus (12 taxa, 19. 4...|$|R
50|$|Forests {{and smaller}} wooded areas {{within the park}} are {{comprised}} mainly by cork oaks (Quercus suber), Portuguese oaks (Quercus faginea), Pyrenean oaks (Quercus pyrenaica), olive trees (Olea europaea), alders (Alnus glutinosa), holly trees (<b>Ilex</b> <b>aquifolium),</b> bay laurels (Laurus nobilis), rhododendrons (Rhododendron ponticum), ferns, mosses, and lichens.|$|R

5000|$|The {{resemblance}} of {{the foliage}} {{to that of}} the common European holly <b>Ilex</b> <b>aquifolium,</b> has led to its common and botanic names. The name [...] was originally the classical Latin name for the holm oak, but later adopted as a botanical genus name for the hollies.|$|R

50|$|The {{sessile oak}} (Quercus petraea), one of Wales' most common species, {{can be found}} across the region. English holly (<b>Ilex</b> <b>aquifolium),</b> {{one of the few}} native {{evergreen}} trees, can found in southern Wales. The wych elm (Ulmus glabra), a native species, suffers from disease and competition introduced by exotic species.|$|R
50|$|Between {{the thirteenth}} and eighteenth centuries, before the {{introduction}} of turnips, <b>Ilex</b> <b>aquifolium</b> was cultivated for use as winter fodder for cattle and sheep. Less spiny varieties of holly were preferred, and in practice the leaves growing {{near the top of}} the tree have far fewer spines making them more suitable for fodder.|$|R

This review explores the toxic reputation and proposed management for exposures to several of those, namely poinsettia (Euphorbia pulcherrima), English holly (<b>Ilex</b> <b>aquifolium),</b> American holly (<b>Ilex</b> opaca),bittersweet (Solanum dulcamara), Jerusalem cherry (Solanum pseudocapsicum), Americanmistletoe (Phoradendron serotinum), and European mistletoe (Viscum album) ...|$|R
50|$|Oak trees {{dominate}} the major elevated areas, especially {{along the banks}} of the river, along with species of Common hazel (Corylus avellana), holly (<b>Ilex</b> <b>aquifolium),</b> chestnut and laurel forming mixed forests, that include rare plants such as Sundew (Drosera rotundifolia), a species of carnivorous plants found in the moist lands along the riverfront.|$|R
50|$|Centuries {{of forest}} {{management}} have shaped the surrounding belts of woodland, composed notably of beech Fagus sylvatica and pedunculate oak Quercus robur. Repeated pollarding has shaped the growth patterns of centuries-old trees. The discontinuous canopy favours a diverse understory, dominated by holly <b>Ilex</b> <b>aquifolium,</b> whitebeam Sorbus aria and rowan S. aucuparia with birches.|$|R
50|$|Millions {{of years}} ago, laurel forests were {{widespread}} around the Mediterranean Basin. The drying {{of the region}} since the Pliocene and cooling during the Ice Ages caused these rainforests to retreat. Some relict Mediterranean laurel forest species, such as Sweet Bay (Laurus nobilis) and European Holly (<b>Ilex</b> <b>aquifolium),</b> are fairly widespread around the Mediterranean basin.|$|R
