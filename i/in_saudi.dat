5|$|In 2013, a {{seroepidemiological study}} (a study {{investigating}} the patterns, {{causes and effects}} of a disease on a specific population {{on the basis of}} serologic tests) in Egypt was the first to show the dromedary might be a host for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). A 2013–14 study of dromedaries <b>in</b> <b>Saudi</b> Arabia concluded the unusual genetic stability of MERS-CoV coupled with its high seroprevalence in the dromedary makes this camel a highly probable host for the virus. The full genome sequence of MERS-CoV from dromedaries in this study showed a 99.9% match to the genomes of human clade B MERS-CoV. Another study <b>in</b> <b>Saudi</b> Arabia showed the presence of MERS-CoV in 90% of the evaluated dromedaries and suggested that camels could be the animal source of MERS-CoV.|$|E

5|$|The {{results of}} the 2004census {{indicates}} that only about 15per cent of foreign workers are in the skilled category, with the remainder mostly working in agriculture, cleaning and domestic service.

Saudi businesses have traditionally adopted an ethnically defined hierarchical organisation. For example, a recent academic study of a Danish manufacturing company's Saudi subsidiary noted that a manager had to be European, a supervisor had to be Egyptian, Filipino employees often had technical roles, and Indians, the lowest in the hierarchy, worked in production. Foreign workers' presence <b>in</b> <b>Saudi</b> Arabia tends to be transitory: only 3% remain in the country for more than six years.|$|E
