5|$|Beginning on the {{airplane}} to Berlin, flashbacks are interlaced throughout the episode, illustrating the tensions caused by Eli's frequent absence during Ziva's adolescence and the disintegration of Rivka (Weronika Rosati) and Eli David's marriage. Also while on the plane, Ziva explains her rationale for changing their destination: her father had told her to convert all funds to diamonds with a dealer in Berlin should she <b>ever</b> <b>need</b> to go into hiding. She assumes {{that he would have}} given Bodnar, who he viewed as a son, the same advice.|$|E
5|$|Like other conduct {{books of}} the time, Thoughts adapts older genres to the new middle-class ethos. The book {{encourages}} mothers to teach their daughters analytical thinking, self-discipline, honesty, contentment in their social position, and marketable skills (in case they should <b>ever</b> <b>need</b> to support themselves). These goals reveal Wollstonecraft's intellectual debt to John Locke; however, the prominence she affords religious faith and innate feeling distinguishes her work from his. Her aim is to educate women to be useful wives and mothers, because, she argues, it is through these roles that they can most effectively contribute to society. The predominantly domestic role Wollstonecraft outlines for womena role that she viewed as meaningfulwas interpreted by 20th-century feminist literary critics as paradoxically confining them to the private sphere.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Italian {{dictator}} Benito Mussolini in September 1943, the German Army occupied Athens, where a minority of Greek Jews had sought refuge. The majority (about 60,000 {{out of a total}} population of 75,000) were deported to Nazi concentration camps, where all but 2,000 died. During this period, Princess Andrew hid Jewish widow Rachel Cohen and two of her five children, who sought to evade the Gestapo and deportation to the death camps. Rachel's husband, Haimaki Cohen, had aided King George I of Greece in 1913. In return, King George had offered him any service that he could perform, should Cohen <b>ever</b> <b>need</b> it. Cohen's son remembered this during the Nazi threat, and appealed to Princess Andrew, who with Princess Nicholas was one of only two remaining {{members of the royal family}} left in Greece. She honoured the promise and saved the Cohen family.|$|E

5|$|Believing Joshua {{will attempt}} another {{break-in}} but will avoid putting innocents in danger, Olivia has Fringe Division statistician Astrid identify three remotely located banks {{and decides to}} investigate them. Olivia finds the bank that Joshua has targeted and discovers his device in a subway tunnel, but he knocks her out before she can investigate further. As he energizes the molecular destabilizer, Fringe Division detects the event and converges on the bank. Matthew eventually finds Joshua, again trying to warn him off, but quickly realizes Joshua has purposely entered the bank to be trapped in the amber. Joshua believes {{this to be the}} only way to force the Fringe team to end their investigation. Matthew escapes the quarantine while Fringe agents Charlie and Lincoln rescue Olivia in time before the amber sets in. Olivia returns to Matthew the next day and confirms the case is closed, but not before collecting a skin sample that, should she <b>ever</b> <b>need</b> it, conclusively proves that it was Matthew in the amber before.|$|E
5|$|Development {{started by}} {{focusing}} on the game's hardware. The staff first debated what type of monitor to use: black and white or color. They reasoned that using advanced technology would better establish them as good designers and chose a color monitor. The developers estimated that the game would require 4colors, but instead chose hardware that could display each pixel in 16colors. At the time, the designers believed that was more than they would <b>ever</b> <b>need</b> for a game. The monitor's resolution is 320×256, an expansion from the then industry standard of 256×256. The staff believed that the wider screen provided a better aspect ratio and would improve the game's presentation. Video games at the time relied on hardware to animate graphics, but the developers decided to use software to handle animation and programmed the game in assembly language. The switch allowed them to display more on-screen objects at a lower cost.|$|E
5|$|In late 1960 {{or early}} 1961, Thorpe visited Vater at the Kingham Stables, and briefly met Josiffe. He was {{sufficiently}} {{taken with the}} young man to suggest that, should Josiffe <b>ever</b> <b>need</b> help, he should call on him at the House of Commons. Soon after this, Josiffe left the stables after a serious disagreement with Vater. He then suffered a mental breakdown, and for much of 1961 was under psychiatric care. On 8 November 1961, a week after discharging himself from the Ashurst clinic, Josiffe went to the House of Commons to see Thorpe. He was penniless, homeless and, worse, had left Vater's employment without the National Insurance card which, at that time, was essential for obtaining regular work and access to social and unemployment benefits. Thorpe promised he would help.|$|E

25|$|The {{increased}} RAM of the 512K was {{vitally important}} for the Macintosh as it finally allowed for more powerful software applications, such as the then-popular program Microsoft Multiplan. However, Apple continued to market the 128K {{for over a year}} as an entry-level computer, the mid-level 512K and high-end Lisa (and claiming that it could be easily expanded should the user <b>ever</b> <b>need</b> more RAM).|$|E
25|$|Later, the Surfer {{works with}} the alien Annunaki race to gather and protect some of Earth's most {{extraordinarily}} gifted children. In the end, one of these children, Ellie Waters, saves Earth from the godlike Marduk entity, preventing the Apocalypse and reordering reality as if the Marduk crisis had never happened (though Ellie alone apparently retains her memories of these events). The Surfer resumes his interstellar wanderings, but promises {{to be ready to}} aid his adopted homeworld should Earth <b>ever</b> <b>need</b> him.|$|E
25|$|I {{went to see}} Professor Douglas Hartree, who {{had built}} the first {{differential}} analyzers in England and had more experience in using these very specialized computers than anyone else.

25|$|Henry Ford's ideological {{approach}} to Model T design {{was one of}} getting it right and then keeping it the same; he believed the Model T was all the car a person would, or could, <b>ever</b> <b>need.</b> As other companies offered comfort and styling advantages, at competitive prices, the Model T lost market share. Design changes were not as few as the public perceived, {{but the idea of}} an unchanging model was kept intact. Eventually, on May 26, 1927, Ford Motor Company ceased US production and began the changeovers required to produce the Model A. Some of the other Model T factories in the world continued a short while.|$|E
25|$|Rose, who {{had begun}} to engage in {{prostitution}} by this time, explained to Owens that {{she worked as a}} masseuse when the younger woman enquired about the steady stream of men visiting her. According to Owens, Fred also said he was a skilled abortionist, who was available should she <b>ever</b> <b>need</b> such a service. Owens also noted Fred talked about sex almost incessantly; her suspicions as to his sexual overtones were further heightened when Fred boasted that many of the women he claimed to have performed abortions upon were so overjoyed that they would offer him their sexual services as a reward. When Owens herself became the recipient of the Wests' overt sexual advances, she announced her intentions to leave Cromwell Street and return home.|$|E
500|$|Between 1971 and 1973, Sonny and Cher's {{recording}} {{career was}} revived with four albums released under Kapp Records and MCA Records: Sonny & Cher Live (1971), All I <b>Ever</b> <b>Need</b> Is You (1972), Mama Was a Rock and Roll Singer, Papa Used to Write All Her Songs (1973), and Live in Las Vegas Vol. 2 (1973).

[...] "Last Call" [...] was written by Hudson while reading the book Last Call for Help: Changing North America One Teen at a Time, written by Dawson McAllister.

500|$|Twelve {{of their}} songs {{were written by}} just Murphy and Turner, {{although}} others also worked with them at times. Guy Mitchell joined them in writing two 1963 songs, [...] "My Lonesome Room" [...] recorded by Roy Clark and [...] "The Only Light I <b>Ever</b> <b>Need</b> is You" [...] for Jerry Wallace, and later Harry Nilsson. Murphy and Turner collaborated with Coy Ziegler on two songs for Jerry Wallace, [...] "Big, Big Day Tomorrow" [...] in 1964 and [...] "Round and Round She Goes" [...] in 1965. [...] Jimmy Bryant (as Ivy J. Bryant) worked with them as both songwriter and singer in 1966 on [...] "Rattle Dance". [...] "Was It All Worth Losing You" [...] co-written with Terri Eddleman in 1970 was the last song Murphy wrote. Charley Pride recorded the song for his album The Incomparable Charley Pride.|$|E
500|$|Sonny and Cher's first album, Look at Us (1965), {{released}} for the Atco Records {{division of}} Atlantic Records, spent eight weeks at number {{two on the}} Billboard 200, behind the Beatles' Help!. Their material became popular, and the duo successfully competed with the dominant British Invasion and Motown sounds of the era. Sonny and Cher charted ten Billboard top 40 singles between 1965 and 1972, including five top-ten singles: [...] "I Got You Babe", [...] "Baby Don't Go", [...] "The Beat Goes On", [...] "All I <b>Ever</b> <b>Need</b> Is You", and [...] "A Cowboy's Work Is Never Done". At one point, they had five songs in the top 50 at the same time, a feat equaled only by the Beatles and Elvis Presley. By the end of 1967, they had sold 40million records worldwide and had become, according to Time magazine's Ginia Bellafante, rock's [...] "it" [...] couple.|$|E

500|$|Five years later, Darabont {{wrote the}} script over an eight-week period. He {{expanded}} on elements of King's story. Brooks, {{who in the}} novella is a minor character who dies in a retirement home, became a tragic character who eventually hanged himself. Tommy, who in the novella trades his evidence exonerating Andy for transfer to a nicer prison, in the screenplay is murdered on the orders of Warden Norton, who is a composite of several warden characters in King's story. Darabont opted to create a single warden character {{to serve as the}} primary antagonist. Among his inspirations, Darabont listed the works of director Frank Capra, including Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939) and It's a Wonderful Life (1946), describing them as tall tales; Darabont likened The Shawshank Redemption to a tall tale more than a prison movie. He also cited Goodfellas (1990) as an inspiration on the use of dialogue to illustrate the passage of time in the script. King never cashed the $5,000 cheque from Darabont for the rights to The Shawshank Redemption; [...] he later framed it and returned it to Darabont accompanied by a note which read: [...] "In case you <b>ever</b> <b>need</b> bail money. Love, Steve." ...|$|E
