40|$|In this study, we {{assessed}} the longitudinal effects of social-cognitive mechanisms on the self-reported use of <b>doping</b> <b>substances</b> and supplements among Italian high school students. In total, 1232 students completed questionnaires measuring various psychological factors hypothesized to influence students' {{intention to use}} substances. Three months later, 762 of the students completed the same questionnaires a second time and also reported their use of substances during the time between assessments. Overall, the percentages of students using <b>doping</b> <b>substances</b> (2. 1 %) or supplements (14. 4 %) were consistent with values reported in the literature. Analysis of the data showed that adolescents' intention to use <b>doping</b> <b>substances</b> increased with stronger attitudes about doping, stronger beliefs that significant others would approve of their use, a stronger conviction that doping use can be justified, and a lowered capacity to resist situational pressure or personal desires. In turn, stronger intentions and moral disengagement contributed to a greater use of <b>doping</b> <b>substances</b> during the previous 3 months. Doping use was also correlated significantly to supplementation. In conclusion, our results provide novel information {{about some of the}} psychological processes possibly regulating adolescents' use of <b>doping</b> <b>substances</b> and supplements.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{nikethamide}} (N,N-diethylnicotinamide, CoramineR) is metabolized very rapidly to nicotinamide.

However, an intermediate metabolite (N-ethylnicotinamide) was found by us in the urine of horses treated with CoramineR.

The excretion and metabolism of nikethamide after intramuscular injection in the horse was followed using quantitative gas chromatography of urine extracts over a period of several hours and the results of these experiments are reported.

40|$|Abstract: Similar to {{many other}} testing {{laboratory}} activities, horseracing laboratory’s operation requires formal recognition of measurement results, mainly to establish {{the presence of a}} wider range of prohibited substances (low concentrations) in biological matrices. The objective of this work is twofold: (i) the qualitative and semi-quantitative assessment of various substances detected among all (over 50, 000) racehorses ’ urine analytical analysis conducted by the Antidoping Laboratory of the Brazilian Jockey Club (LAD/JCB) between 1996 and 2005 to identify the most frequent prohibited substances marked as ‘forbidden ’ on the list of Brazilian National Horseracing Code (CNC) [1] and (ii) to develop and validate an specific mass spectrometry analytical method for the routine determination of traces of doping by caffeine. Caffeine confirmed to be the most common <b>doping</b> <b>substance</b> used in the Brazilian horseracing activity in 2002 when this investigation started. The tailored made analytical method developed (ALCAC- 18), ensuring that false-negative ’ results are kept to a minimum, was then validated for the determination of caffeine...|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of quantum vortex pairs carrying heavy doping matter trapped inside their cores is studied. The nonlinear classical matter field formalism {{is used to}} build a universal mathematical model of a heavy vortex applicable to different types of quantum mixtures. It is shown how the usual vortex dynamics typical for undoped pairs qualitatively changes when heavy dopants are used: heavy vortices with opposite topological charges (chiralities) attract each other, while vortices with the same charge are repelled. The force responsible for such behavior appears {{as a result of}} superposition of vortices velocity fields in the presence of <b>doping</b> <b>substance</b> and can be considered as a special realization of the Magnus effect. The force is evaluated quantitatively and its inverse proportionality to the distance is demonstrated. The mechanism described in this paper gives an example of how a light nonlinear classical field may realize repulsive and attractive interactions between embedded heavy impurities...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} doping knowledge and practice among the elite athletes in tertiary institutions in Nigeria. Also, it examined {{the extent to}} which athletes in tertiary institutions have actually used <b>doping</b> <b>substances.</b> A total of 510 athletes (255 males and 255 females) were randomly sampled from tertiary institutions in three states (Ekiti, Ondo and Oyo States). A structured questionnaire designed by the researchers was used to collect relevant data for the study. The data collected were analysed using descriptive statistics, Chi-square (X 2) test and Analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results showed that athletes in tertiary institutions were aware of <b>doping</b> <b>substances</b> used in sports. The athletes had tried <b>doping</b> <b>substances</b> such as methadone, cocaine, phenobarbital, stanozolol, nandrolone decanoate and caffeine. The study revealed that more male than female athletes engaged in doping practices. Also, the type of sports participated by the athletes influenced their doping habits. It was therefore recommended that the Nigerian Government should intensify its campaign and public enlightenment programmes to educate the athletes and sports handlers on the health consequences of doping to enhance sports performance. Also, the Government should make funds, facilities and personnel available for a forensic laboratory for drug testing...|$|R

Methods The main method used in this thesis was an analysis of documents, especially doping protocols, which led to gathering important data and compile final tables, which were subsequently processed and evaluated. Finally, aninterview with two bodybuilders who have received completely different penalties for the same offense. Results This thesis comes {{to the conclusion that}} the most commonly used substances are, in order: testosterone, nandrolone, marijuana, ephedrine and then metandienon. The most common individual sports, where the use of doping substances is most commonly encoutered include bodybuilding and powerlifting. In team sports, it is hockey, rugby, water polo and handball.

40|$|Abstract—Microwave {{pyrolysis}} overcomes {{the disadvantages}} of conventional pyrolysis methods by efficiently {{improving the quality}} of final pyrolysis products. Biochar, one of the end products of this process is considered an efficient vector for sequestering carbon to offset atmospheric carbon dioxide. The dielectric properties of the doping agents (i. e., char and graphite) were assessed over the range of 25 ◦– 400 ◦C and used to develop a finite element model (FEM). This model served to couple electromagnetic heating, combustion, and heat and mass transfer phenomena and evaluated the advantages of selective heating of woody biomass during microwave pyrolysis. The dielectric properties of the doping agents were a function of temperature and decreased up to 100 ◦C and thereafter remained constant. Regression analysis indicated that char would be a better <b>doping</b> <b>substance</b> than graphite. The simulation study found that doping helped to provide a more efficient heat transfer within the biomass compared to non-doped samples. Char doping yielded better heat transfer compared to graphite doping, as it resulted in optimal temperatures for maximization of biochar production. The model was then validated through experimental trials in a custom-built microwave pyrolysis unit which confirmed that char doping would be better suited for maximization of biochar...|$|E

Methods: On the basis of information obtained from the World anti-doping agency (WADA) I performed an evaluation of doping offences. It dealt with the evaluation of results of doping controls in triathlon and cycling in the Czech Republic. Further I evaluated the results of doping controls in triathlon and cycling in {{the world on the}} basis of WADA information and compared them with the ones from the Czech Republic.
