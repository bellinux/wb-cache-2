50|$|<b>Insecticides</b> can be {{classified}} in two major groups: systemic <b>insecticides,</b> which have residual or long term activity; and contact <b>insecticides,</b> which have no residual activity.|$|R
50|$|Contact <b>insecticides</b> are {{toxic to}} insects upon direct contact. These can be {{inorganic}} <b>insecticides,</b> which are metals and include arsenates, copper and fluorine compounds, which are less commonly used, and the commonly used sulfur. Contact <b>insecticides</b> can be organic <b>insecticides,</b> i.e. organic chemical compounds, synthetically produced, and comprising the largest numbers of pesticides used today.

5|$|For {{thousands}} of years, traditional herbal remedies {{have been used}} to treat malaria. The first effective treatment for malaria came from the bark of cinchona tree, which contains quinine. After the link to mosquitos and their parasites were identified in the early twentieth century, mosquito control measures such as widespread use of the <b>insecticide</b> DDT, swamp drainage, covering or oiling the surface of open water sources, indoor residual spraying and use of <b>insecticide</b> treated nets was initiated. Prophylactic quinine was prescribed in malaria endemic areas, and new therapeutic drugs, including chloroquine and artemisinins, were used to resist the scourge. Today, artemisinin is present in every remedy applied in treatment of malaria. After introducing artemisinin as a cure administered together with other remedies, the mortality in Africa went down by a half.|$|E
50|$|Phenylpyrazole <b>insecticides</b> are a {{class of}} {{chemical}}ly-related broad-spectrum <b>insecticides.</b> The chemical structures of these <b>insecticides</b> are characterized by a central pyrazole ring with a phenyl group attached {{to one of the}} nitrogen atoms of the pyrazole.|$|R
40|$|The {{environmental}} conditions that affect fate and bio-availability of <b>insecticides</b> are often linked with community trophic status. An increase in adsorption of <b>insecticides</b> to sediments and organic matter in nutrient-loaded systems generally {{results in a}} decrease in bio-availability. By reducing arthropod populations <b>insecticides</b> may temporarily reduce the top-down control of algae, thereby enhancing the stimulatory effects of nutrient loading. Non-arthropod grazers of algae not susceptible to <b>insecticides</b> may soon take over the control (functional redundancy).

5|$|In 2005, {{a team of}} {{scientists}} led by the National Institute of Beekeeping in Bologna, Italy, found pollen obtained from seeds dressed with imidacloprid contain significant levels of the <b>insecticide,</b> and suggested the polluted pollen might cause honey bee colony death. Analysis of maize and sunflower crops originating from seeds dressed with imidacloprid suggest large amounts of the <b>insecticide</b> will be carried back to honey bee colonies. Sublethal doses of imidacloprid in sucrose solution have also been documented to affect homing and foraging activity of honey bees. Imidacloprid in sucrose solution fed to bees in the laboratory impaired their communication for a few hours. Sublethal doses of imidacloprid in laboratory and field experiment decreased flight activity and olfactory discrimination, and olfactory learning performance was impaired.|$|E
5|$|A {{potential}} {{obstacle to}} the adoption of biological pest control measures is growers sticking to the familiar use of pesticides. However, pesticides have a variety of undesired effects, including the development of resistance among pests, and the destruction of natural enemies; these may in turn enable outbreaks of pests of other species than the ones originally targeted, and on crops at a distance from those treated with pesticides. One method of increasing grower adoption of biocontrol methods involves letting them learn by doing, for example showing them simple field experiments, enabling them to observe the live predation of pests, or demonstrations of parasitised pests. In the Philippines, early season sprays against leaf folder caterpillars were common practice, but growers were asked to follow a 'rule of thumb' of not spraying against leaf folders for the first 30 days after transplanting; participation in this resulted in a reduction of <b>insecticide</b> use by 1/3 and a change in grower perception of <b>insecticide</b> use.|$|E

The effect of misuse of <b>insecticides</b> in traditional farms was also followed. The best <b>insecticides</b> was cypermethrin, which reduced infestation by 85. 5 %, followed by Beta-cyfluthrin (67. 3 %). The results indicate the decrease in the efficiency of these <b>insecticides</b> due to misuse in those farms. There was similarity among the results of most of these <b>insecticides,</b> except for cypermethrin and Beta-cyfluthrin.

50|$|Insects were a {{huge problem}} in the United States, and they often ruined entire crops. Emerging in the 1940s, DDT and other <b>insecticides</b> seemed to offer the solution. As more <b>insecticides</b> were invented, the science of {{entomology}} changed focus from insect classification, to primarily testing new <b>insecticides</b> and exterminating insects rather than cataloguing them. But as early as 1946-48, entomologists began to notice that <b>insecticides</b> were having {{a negative impact on}} other animals, particularly birds.|$|R
5|$|In Europe, {{pyrethroids}} and neonicotinoids {{have been}} used against B. rufimanus. Because of the faba bean crop biology and its attraction to pollinators at flowering stage, restrictions on pesticides uses have been introduced in Europe. It is particularly advised to spray in absence of pollinators {{in the early morning}} and evening. In addition, due to B. rufimanus biology, a temperature threshold combined with crop development stage can be used to increase the success of chemical treatments. Adult B. rufimanus activity increases with temperature, so that treatment efficiency might increase when maximum day temperatures are over 20°C during four consecutive days after treatment (Arvalis, 2016). Adult B. rufimanus activity increases with temperature, so that treatment efficiency might increase when maximum day temperatures are over 20°C during four consecutive days after treatment. The end of blooming indicates the end of adult activity in the field. This stage is therefore a threshold marking the end of <b>insecticide</b> application and occurs no later than five days after last blooming. Forecasting systems (Bruchi-LIS, Arvalis, France and BruchidCast, Syngenta, UK) have been developed to optimize <b>insecticide</b> applications based on temperature and crop stage.|$|E
5|$|N.californiensis has a {{negative}} impact on oyster production, and as a result, the <b>insecticide</b> carbaryl (1-napthyl N-methyl carbamate) is sprayed in some areas (including Willapa Bay, Washington) to reduce the population of N.californiensis. The addition of shelly debris also reduces numbers of N.californiensis both by preventing the settlement of larvae, and through predation on the young N.californiensis by young Dungeness crabs in the shelly debris.|$|E

40|$|<b>Insecticides</b> {{are used}} by growers to control Frankliniella occidentalis (western flower thrips) in Australian {{vegetable}} crops. However, limited information was available on the efficacy of some <b>insecticides</b> used against F. occidentalis and data on new <b>insecticides</b> that could {{be included in a}} resistance management program were required. The efficacy of 16 <b>insecticides</b> in controlling F. occidentalis was tested in four small plot trials in chillies and capsicums. Spinosad, fipronil and methamidophos were effective against adults and larvae. Spirotetramat had no efficacy against adults but was very effective against larvae. Pyridalyl was moderately effective against larvae. Methidathion showed limited effectiveness. Abamectin, amorphous silica, bifenthrin, chlorpyrifos, dimethoate, emamectin benzoate, endosulfan, imidacloprid, methomyl and insecticidal soap were not effective. Laboratory bioassays on F. occidentalis collected from the field trials showed resistance to bifenthrin but not to the other <b>insecticides</b> tested. The trials demonstrated that some <b>insecticides</b> permitted for use against F. occidentalis are not effective and identified a number of <b>insecticides,</b> including the new ones spirotetramat and pyridalyl, that are effective and {{that could be used to}} manage the pest within a resistance management program...|$|R
