5|$|Caching is {{inhibited}} by {{the presence}} of Steller's jays (Cyanocitta stelleri) and grey jays from adjacent territories, which follow resident grey jays to steal cached food. Grey jays carry large <b>food</b> <b>items</b> to distant cache sites for storage more often than small <b>food</b> <b>items.</b> To prevent theft, they also tend to carry valuable <b>food</b> <b>items</b> further from the source when caching in the company of one or more grey jays. Scatterhoarding discourages pilferage by competitors, while increased cache density leads to increased thievery. In southern portions of the grey jay's range, food is not cached during summer because of the chance of spoilage and the reduced need for winter stores.|$|E

5|$|Birds {{that employ}} many {{strategies}} to obtain food or feed {{on a variety}} of <b>food</b> <b>items</b> are called generalists, while others that concentrate time and effort on specific <b>food</b> <b>items</b> or have a single strategy to obtain food are considered specialists. Birds' feeding strategies vary by species. Many birds glean for insects, invertebrates, fruit, or seeds. Some hunt insects by suddenly attacking from a branch. Those species that seek pest insects are considered beneficial 'biological control agents' and their presence encouraged in biological pest control programmes.|$|E
40|$|The {{understanding}} of physical causality in common marmosets {{was tested using}} support problems in which a pair of sheets was presented to determine whether subjects would choose the sheet that had a <b>food</b> <b>item</b> on it (i. e., the sheet was supporting the <b>food</b> <b>item).</b> In two experiments, the conditions were manipulated {{in terms of the}} length of the sheet, the distance between the sheet and the <b>food</b> <b>item,</b> the presence of a gap separating the two sheets, {{and the size of the}} <b>food</b> <b>item.</b> In Experiment 1, the marmosets had difficulty rejecting an irretrievable <b>food</b> <b>item</b> when it was located closer to them than a retrievable item. Although their performance was strongly affected by the size of the irretrievable <b>food</b> <b>item,</b> they quickly learned to reject that alternative. In contrast, no improvement was found when one sheet was divided into two pieces such that the <b>food</b> <b>item</b> could not be retrieved when its near side was pulled. A similar response tendency was observed in Experiment 2, in which the effects of the large <b>food</b> <b>item</b> were examined in three different conditions. Thus, common marmosets were influenced by the perceptual features of the food in solving the support problems, as are other non-human primates. In addition, they consistently failed to appreciate the presence of a gap and, therefore, failed to reject the distracter alternative. However, all animals rapidly learned that the size of the <b>food</b> <b>item</b> was an irrelevant variable, and some showed an elementary conceptual {{understanding of}} support. These findings suggest that marmosets’ physical understanding may improve with experience...|$|R

40|$|Behavioural mimicry is a {{potential}} mechanism explaining why adolescents appear {{to be influenced by}} their parents' eating behaviour. In the current study we examined whether there is evidence that adolescent females mimic their parents when eating. Videos of thirty-eight parent and female adolescent dyads eating a lunchtime meal together were examined. We tested whether a parent placing a <b>food</b> <b>item</b> into their mouth was associated with an increased likelihood that their adolescent child would place any <b>food</b> <b>item</b> (non-specific mimicry) or the same item (specific mimicry) in their mouth at three different time frames, namely, during the same second or within the next fifteen seconds (+ 15), five seconds (+ 5) or two second (+ 2) period. Parents and adolescents' overall food intake was positively correlated, whereby a parent eating a larger amount of food was associated with the adolescent eating a larger meal. Across all of the three time frames adolescents were more likely to place a <b>food</b> <b>item</b> in their mouth if their parent had recently placed that same <b>food</b> <b>item</b> in their mouth (specific <b>food</b> <b>item</b> mimicry); however, {{there was no evidence of}} non-specific mimicry. This observational study suggests that when eating in a social context there is evidence that adolescent females may mimic their parental eating behaviour, selecting and eating more of a <b>food</b> <b>item</b> if their parent has just started to eat that food...|$|R
5|$|<b>Food</b> <b>items</b> include snails, worms, small crustaceans, {{flies and}} beetles. The {{proportions}} of each prey species vary with season and locality. Amphipod larvae {{are important in}} Ireland and Scotland, crustaceans in Norway, and the mollusc Assiminea grayana in the Netherlands. Small fish are occasionally eaten, and in hard weather pipits may scavenge for other food, including human food litter. There is little competition from other species for food, since rocky beach specialists like the purple sandpiper take slightly larger <b>food</b> <b>items,</b> and may wade in deeper water. When food is abundant, meadow pipits may also feed on the shore, but are driven away by the Eurasian rock pipits when there is less prey available.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{nuthatch}} eats mainly insects, particularly caterpillar and beetles. In autumn and winter, {{the diet}} is supplemented with nuts and seeds, hazel nuts and beech mast being preferred. The young are fed {{mainly on the}} insects favoured by their parents, with some seeds. <b>Food</b> <b>items</b> are found mainly on tree trunks and large branches, but smaller branches may also be investigated, and food may be taken from the ground, especially outside the breeding season. Nuthatches can forage when descending trees head first, as well as when climbing. Some prey is caught in flight, and a nuthatch will remove bark or rotten wood to reach insects, although it cannot chisel into healthy wood like a woodpecker. A pair may temporarily join a mixed-species foraging flock as it passes near their territory. The Eurasian nuthatch readily visits bird tables and bird feeders in winter, eating human-made <b>food</b> <b>items</b> such as fat, cheese, butter and bread. It has even been recorded as taking slaughterhouse offal. Sizeable hard <b>food</b> <b>items</b> like nuts or large insects are wedged into crevices in tree bark and smashed with the strong bill.|$|E

40|$|The {{functional}} response {{describes the}} relationship between feeding rate and prey density, and is important ecologically as it describes how foraging behaviour may change in response to food availability. The effects of habitat complexity and <b>food</b> <b>item</b> size were experimentally tested on the foraging parameters and functional responses of the freshwater fish roach Rutilus rutilus. Habitat complexity was varied through the manipulation of substrate and turbidity, and <b>food</b> <b>item</b> size was varied by using fishmeal pellets in two sizes. As water turbidity and substrate complexity increased, the reaction distance and consumption rate (per number) significantly decreased. Increased <b>food</b> <b>item</b> size significantly decreased consumption rates (per number) but had no influence on any other foraging parameter. Analysis of the interactions between substrate complexity, turbidity and <b>food</b> <b>item</b> size revealed <b>food</b> <b>item</b> size had the greatest influence on consumption rate (per number). Turbidity had the least effect on all the foraging parameters tested. Across all experiments, the functional responses were best described by the Type II response, a relatively consistent finding for R. rutilus. These outputs reveal that fish foraging behaviours and functional responses are highly context dependent, varying with environmental parameters {{and the availability of}} food resources of different sizes...|$|R
