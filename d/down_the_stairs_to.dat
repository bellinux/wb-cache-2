5|$|Momolo {{came home}} to find the {{apartment}} empty apart from Vitta, Marianna's brother (also called Angelo Padovani), the two policemen and Edgardo himself. At about 20:00 the carabinieri arrived, in two carriages—one for Lucidi and his men, and another in which Agostini would drive Edgardo. Lucidi entered the apartment and took Edgardo from his father's arms, prompting the two policemen who had guarded him to shed tears. Momolo followed the police <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> the street, then fainted. Edgardo was passed to Agostini and driven away.|$|E
5|$|Ellen {{encounters}} her possessed {{friend and}} flees into another room, grabbing knives to protect her. Something attempts {{to enter the}} room where Ellen is hiding, and she blindly lashes out with a knife - mistakenly stabbing Scotty who had just returned to the cabin. While horrified, Ellen is then attacked by the possessed Bruce. Ellen manages to trap Bruce outside, stabbing Bruce's hand {{several times in the}} process. The bleeding Scotty tells Ellen to look into the cellar for the gun they brought along. While walking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> the cellar, she trips on a broken step and injures herself. After finding the gun, she goes back up stairs and discovers that Scotty had been stabbed to death while she was downstairs. The demonic Bruce then attacks her, but she manages to cut off his hand.|$|E
25|$|Frechette, in her {{harboring}} trial testimony, {{said that}} she told Dillinger {{that the police had}} showed up after speaking to Cummings. Upon hearing Van Meter firing at Coulter, Dillinger opened fire through the door with a Thompson submachine gun, sending Cummings scrambling for cover. Dillinger then stepped out and fired another burst at Cummings. Cummings shot back with a revolver, but quickly ran out of ammunition. He hit Dillinger in the left calf with one of his five shots. He then hastily retreated <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> the front entrance. Once Cummings retreated, Dillinger and Frechette hurried down the stairs, exited through the back door and drove away in the Hudson.|$|E

60|$|I start up. She is {{wringing}} her hands. ‘What is wrong?’ I cry, but I {{know before}} she answers.

25|$|He {{took the}} {{elevator}} to the executive reception area on the third floor and, as soon as the doors opened, fired at receptionists Sharon Needy, whom he killed, and Angela Bowman, whom he paralyzed with a shot in the back. Searching for Standard Gravure's President, Michael Shea, and other supervisors and managers of the plant, Wesbecker calmly walked through the hallways, deliberately shooting at people. He killed James Husband and injured Forrest Conrad, Paula Warman and John Stein, a bindery supervisor whom he shot in the head and abdomen. Wesbecker then headed <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> the pressroom, where he killed Paul Sallee and wounded Stanley Hatfield and David Sadenfaden, two electricians from Marine Electric who were working on a broken machine.|$|E
500|$|Already {{skeptical of}} Napolitano's support of [...] "Brasco", Massino was deeply {{disturbed}} by the breach of security when he learned of the agent's true identity. Vitale would later testify {{that this was the}} reason Massino subsequently decided to murder Napolitano as well; as he would later quote Massino, [...] "I have to give him a receipt for the Donnie Brasco situation." [...] In his own testimony, Massino instead claimed Napolitano was targeted for trying to take over the Bonannos himself. On August 17 the former renegade Frank Lino and Steven Cannone drove Napolitano to the house of Ronald Filocomo, a Bonanno family associate, for a meeting. Napolitano was greeted by captain Frank Coppa, then thrown <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> the house's basement by Lino and shot to death.

60|$|I waited as patiently and inconspicuously as I could, and at {{ten o'clock}} I saw that my man had {{obviously}} finished his work for the morning and had finally come <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> ready <b>to</b> go home. I followed him.|$|R
60|$|Stephen thanked his {{new friend}} for the {{note to the}} bank president, and went slowly <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> <b>To</b> be keyed up to a battle-pitch, and then to have the battle deferred, is a trial of flesh and spirit.|$|E
