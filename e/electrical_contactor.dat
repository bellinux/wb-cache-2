50|$|An <b>electrical</b> <b>contactor</b> is an {{electrically}} controlled switch which closes a {{power or}} high voltage electrical circuit. A plasma contactor changes the electrically insulating vacuum into a conductor by providing movable electrons and positive gas ions. This conductive path closes a phantom loop circuit to discharge or neutralize the static electricity that can build up on a spacecraft.|$|E

40|$|Since ages, {{copper and}} its alloys have found {{extensive}} applications in manufacture of bushes and bearings, heat transfer conductors, high conductivity <b>electrical</b> <b>contactors</b> and so on. However, currently, {{in all these}} applications, {{there is a significant}} enhancement in the service loads, wear resistance, conductivity thus forcing the material researchers to develop a newer class of copper based advanced materials. In this direction, researchers have focused their attention on improving the strength and the tribological properties by reinforcing copper with hard ceramic reinforcements such as Silicon carbide and Titanium carbide. The major drawbacks of these copper based composites are reduced conductivity and poor machinability. These two are the major factors that strongly influence the popularity of the developed copper based composites in several technological fields of applications. To overcome this, efforts are on to make use of a soft phase such as graphite as a additional reinforcement to the conventional copper based hard reinforced composites. Graphite being a solid lubricant can improve the machinability of the composites. Furthermore, graphite possess excellent thermal and electrical conductivity thereby, can improve the conducting capability of copper composites. In the light of the above facts, this paper aims at discussing the tribological characteristic...|$|R

In current scenario the materials for conducting purpose has an overwhelming research capability. Now a day the silver based electrical contact composite material have provided the potential applications in aerospace and automobile industries. Among silver based contact material the silver cadmium oxide and silver tin oxide plays a vital role in fabrication of <b>electrical</b> <b>contactors.</b> In this research an attempt has been made to study the influence of adding Aluminum with silver based electrical contact composite materials by two different processing routes namely stir-casting and powder metallurgy. Silver and aluminum matrix plays a virtual role in composite world owing to their highest conductivity. Optimum parameters were identified for attaining the maximum properties such as conductivity, hardness, density, and porosity of composition. By this better conducting property and mechanical property of the electrical contact can be improved by this system.

40|$|Methods {{to measure}} {{electric}} field fluctuations accurately in a plasma with an active monopole antenna are described. It is {{shown that the}} conductive surfaces of the antenna must be adequately isolated from the ambient plasma and that the monopole must be sufficiently short to avoid antenna amplifier saturation. Experimental results illustrate that the noise produced by plasma contactor operation and sensed by the antenna is due to plasma phenomena and is not induced by laboratory power supplies. A good correlation is shown between the current fluctuations in the <b>contactor</b> <b>electrical</b> circuit and the noise detected by the antenna. A large body of experimental data support {{the conclusion that the}} majority of noise sensed by the antenna at frequencies less than 1 MHz is due to current fluctuations (electrostatic waves) in the plasma adjacent to the antenna and not to electromagnetic wave radiation. Caution is suggested when comparing antenna noise measurements to conventional specifications for radiated emissions...|$|R
40|$|Being the workhorse, {{induction}} motors {{are serving}} the industry. Mostly {{we can see}} squirrel cage motors, but when it's come to the large industries, wound rotor induction motors are also there. Applications like Mills, Large Fans, Pumps, Blowers, Crushers and Overhead Cranes which require higher starting torques use wound rotor induction motors {{to have a higher}} starting torque at a lower starting current at the stator. Generally wound rotor induction motors require more maintenance than squirrel cage motors because of its rotor construction, slip ring assembly and the starting method used. Conventionally, wound rotor motors use an external resistor bank, which is connected to the rotor winding via slip rings, and external rotor resistance varies from a maximum value to zero as the rotor speed develops. Varying the external resistance can be achieved by several electromechanical methods. This is done in a stepwise manner with a motorized camshaft with electromechanical contact points or with a set of <b>electrical</b> power <b>contactors</b> and timers having a suitable time delay between adjacent steps. The traditional starter is highly mechanical and can cause lot of startup delays and is bulkier and requires frequent maintenance. To ensure right operation of rotor resistance control, the motor control circuit incorporates several additional measures and these are too prone to failures due to their own nature. Due to high heat dissipation in the resistors the number of consecutive startups during a short time period is also limited. The proposed power electronic starter is entirely a power electronic device, which is having a three-phase rectifier bridge and a programmable transistor chopper. Programmable transistor chopper ensures a gradual speed development at rotor and control the acceleration with the duty factor of the transistor. This could eliminate the major disadvantage of traditional starter, which is the dependability of rotor speed with the load torque by extending it to have a closed loop speed control. Thereby we can ensure the programmable torque-speed characteristics with this power electronic starter. This power electronic development will minimize the overall maintenance, and avoid current fluctuations completely during speed changes while demanding speed up or down at the rotor. This report discusses the proposal, simulations in prone to the construction, hardware design and practical implementation and testing of starter with a no load wound rotor motor. Latter part of the report shows the performances of new starter over the conventional starter and future developments possible...|$|R
