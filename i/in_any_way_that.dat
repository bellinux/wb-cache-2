5|$|In 1621, a {{bill was}} {{presented}} to Parliament to renew Magna Carta; although this bill failed, lawyer John Selden argued during Darnell's Case in 1627 that the right of habeas corpus was backed by Magna Carta. Coke supported the Petition of Right in 1628, which cited Magna Carta in its preamble, attempting to extend the provisions, and to make them binding on the judiciary. The monarchy responded by arguing that the historical legal situation was much less clear-cut than was being claimed, restricted the activities of antiquarians, arrested Coke for treason, and suppressed his proposed book on Magna Carta. Charles initially did not agree to the Petition of Right, and refused to confirm Magna Carta <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> would reduce his independence as King.|$|E
5|$|For {{his great}} {{services}} at Hohenfriedberg, Frederick {{gave him the}} captaincy of Tatiau, which carried with it a salary of 500 thalers a year. Later on he became Governor of Kolberg in Pomerania. At Battle of Hennersdorf, Zieten repulsed the sudden and unexpected assault of the united Austro-Saxon force; Winterfeldt arrived on the field in {{time to take a}} decisive part in the victory. Once again the rivals had to share the laurels, and Zieten wrote to the king in disparagement of Winterfeldt, receiving in reply a full and generous recognition of his own worth and services, coupled with the curt remark that the king intended to employ General von Winterfeldt <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> he thought fit. During the ten years peace that preceded the next great war, Winterfeldt was in constant attendance upon the king, except when employed on confidential missions in the provinces or abroad. For example, he was sent to London for negotiating the Convention of Westminster. In 1756 he was made a lieutenant general and received the Order of the Black Eagle and the Order Pour le MÃ©rite.|$|E

25|$|Non-directional and hybrid {{personal}} line markers {{are used to}} indicate {{the identity of a}} diver who has passed along the line and has not yet returned to that point. They are attached to the line {{in the same way as}} cave arrows, and are deployed on the way into the cave, usually at critical points such as forks or jumps, and are used to indicate to other divers that someone is further in along the line. They are marked to identify the diver, and are recovered by the diver on the way out. Cookies (round markers), Rectangular referencing exit markers and clothes pegs are used for this purpose. The round and rectangular markers are attached to the line in the same way as arrows, and may be personalised <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> the owners can easily recognise. Colour is often used, but as there are a limited number of standard colours available, and they are often poorly distinguishable in the dark, modifications to shape may be used which can be recognised by touch.|$|E

500|$|On July 14, 1997, {{three days}} after the film opened in the United States, Warner Bros. {{received}} a letter from White House Counsel Charles Ruff protesting against the use of Clinton's digitally-composited appearance. The letter made no demands, but called the duration and manner of Clinton's appearance [...] "inappropriate". No legal action was planned; the White House Counsel simply wanted {{to send a message to}} Hollywood to avoid unauthorized uses of the President's image. Zemeckis was reminded that official White House policy [...] "prohibits the use of the President <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> ...

500|$|On 20 May 1745, {{he and his}} hussars {{distinguished}} {{themselves with}} a daring nocturnal passage of an Austrian corps of 20,000 men. Zieten led the famous Zietenritt (Zietenride) around the enemy's lines to deliver the King's order to a distant detachment. Two weeks later, at Hohenfriedberg on 4 June, the Zieten Hussars distinguished themselves {{for the first time}} in a battle. A second victory in the Battle of Hennersdorf in November, the Zieten Hussars shadowed the enemy, waiting to pounce on them. [...] At Hennersdorf, Zieten repulsed the sudden and unexpected assault of the Austro-Saxons; Winterfeldt arrived on the field in time to take a decisive part in the victory. Once again the rivals had to share their laurels, and Zieten actually wrote to the king in disparagement of Winterfeldt, receiving in reply a full and generous recognition of his own worth and services, coupled with the curt remark that the king intended to employ General von Winterfeldt <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> he thought fit.|$|E

That summer, Bellows wrote to Matt Meyer, {{the head of}} the new company, that it would be [...] "almost impossible -- with the present staff -- to publish a Herald Tribune I would be proud to be the editor of, or be able to compete with successfully in the morning field." [...] On August 13, with the strike still going on, the management decided to end publication of the Tribune, which Whitney announced in the ninth-floor auditorium of the Tribune building on August 15. [...] "I know we gave something good to our city while we published and I know it will be a loss to journalism in this country as we cease publication," [...] Whitney said.

500|$|Part III of the ISA {{deals with}} {{security}} areas. Section 48, {{which is the}} only provision in Chapter I of Part III, empowers the President, acting on the Cabinet's advice, to proclaim any area in Singapore a security area if in his opinion public security in the area [...] "is seriously disturbed or threatened by reason of any action taken or threatened by any substantial body of persons, whether inside or outside Singapore, to cause or to cause a substantial number of citizens to fear organised violence against persons or property" [...] and [...] "he considers it to be necessary for the purpose of suppressing such organised violence".

500|$|Like Eno's {{previous}} album Here Come the Warm Jets, Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy) {{received a}} mostly very positive reception from critics. Writing for the Village Voice, Robert Christgau gave the album {{a rating of}} Aâ, writing [...] "Every cut on this clear, consistent, elusive album affords distinct present pleasure. Admittedly, when they're over they're overâyou don't flash on them {{the way you do}} on [...] "Cindy Tells Me" [...] and [...] "Baby's on Fire". But that's just his way of being modest." [...] Wayne Robbins of Creem lauded Eno for the way he [...] "grafts seemingly disparate elements <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> might be useful to his flow". Robbins explained, [...] "It sounds like it might be pretentious; it's not, because Eno is comfortable with those pretensions"; he concluded that [...] "a man who can write songs like 'Burning Airlines Give You So Much More' has seen the future, and the future is a sonic Disney named Eno, who makes music you can live with". Circus magazine described the album as [...] "Sick! Sick! Sick! But, oh-h-h, it feels so good! [...] guaranteed to be put on the 'Most Wanted' list by psychopaths everywhere [...] takes you on a dada-ists tour-de-force, lampooning and integrating every type of music conceivable". Critic Ed Naha, writing in Crawdaddy!, gave the album a negative review, writing [...] "Much of the Wonderlandish magic found on Eno's first LP is lost on this rocky terrain, being replaced by a dull, repetitive aura that is annoying as all hell." [...] In 1975 Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy) was voted one of the best albums {{of the year in the}} Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics poll for 1975.|$|E

500|$|Some {{reception}} of the film, however, was much more positive, in particular by reviewers for horror outlets. Michael Gingold of Fangoria gave it two-and-half out of four skulls, while Jonathan Barkan of Bloody Disgusting gave it {{four out of five}} skulls, stating it [...] "isnât a movie meant to scare or make you think but {{it is one of the}} most entertaining and enjoyable movies of its kind that Iâve seen in years." [...] Scott Weinberg of FEARnet wrote that [...] "aside from some very clunky editorial missteps in the film's second half, there's a good deal of wit, enthusiasm, energy, and amusing attitude to be found in the dumb-yet-self-aware Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," [...] all while noting that he is [...] "not the type to act snobbish around a ridiculous film that obviously knows it's ridiculous." [...] According to Ryan Larson of Shock Till You Drop, the film [...] "is a mixed bag" [...] but [...] "fortunately, the lows donât appear as often as you would think," [...] and, [...] "if taken at face value, Hansel & Gretel is well worth the view." [...] William Bibbiani of CraveOnline, who criticized the film's inadequately [...] "limp" [...] marketing campaign, found the movie itself [...] "inherently stupid" [...] but in a good way, [...] "played with humor, ultraviolence and anachronistic fetish." [...] Cinema Blend's Sean O'Connell stated that the film is [...] "often mean and nasty, but that's really its saving grace." [...] Peter Paras of E! recommended this [...] "super violent, pretty funny flick" [...] for how it [...] "revels in the mayhem". Tom Russo of The Boston Globe, giving the film three out of five stars, called it a [...] "splattery fanboy fun. Preposterous, clearly, but fun." [...] Jonathon Natsis of Filmink wrote: [...] "Hansel and Gretel is not a 'film'. It's a 'movie', in all its unabashed, excitable glory...big on blood-soaked entertainment and low on pretension." [...] Rick Florino of Artistdirect gave it four out of five stars, stating: [...] "This has all the elements of a classic action flick, and it's destined for cult status. Welcome to the most fun movie of 2013." [...] DVD Talk's Jamie S. Rich summed up: [...] "Is Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters a good movie? Probably not. At least not <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> is defensible by regular critical standards. Is it a hell of a good time? Absolutely so. Unabashedly so. That's all it wants to be." ...|$|E
