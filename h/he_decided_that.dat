5|$|The {{trial judge}} also {{concluded}} that Thomas had been properly informed {{of his right}} to silence, and had not been induced by the AFP officers {{to participate in the}} interview by offer of repatriation or any other reward. Ultimately <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> Thomas had participated voluntarily in the interview, and that in the circumstances, Thomas' lack of legal advice should not make the record of the interview inadmissible.|$|E
5|$|As {{the decade}} progressed, Henry {{increasingly}} wanted {{to resolve the}} question of the inheritance. <b>He</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> he would divide up his empire after his death, with Young Henry receiving England and Normandy, Richard being given the Duchy of Aquitaine, and Geoffrey acquiring Brittany. This would require the consent of Louis as king of France, and accordingly Henry and Louis held fresh peace talks in 1169 at Montmirail. The talks were wide-ranging, culminating with Henry's sons giving homage to Louis for their future inheritances in France, and with Richard being betrothed to Louis's daughter Alice.|$|E

5|$|Brisingr is {{the third}} novel in the Inheritance Cycle by Christopher Paolini. It was {{released}} on September 20, 2008. Originally, Paolini intended to conclude the then Inheritance Trilogy in three books, but during writing the third book <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> the series was too complex to conclude in one book, because the single book would be close to 1,500 pages long. A deluxe edition of Brisingr, which includes removed scenes and previously unseen art, was released on October 13, 2009.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{spent most}} of this time {{exploring}} on land: three years and three months on land, 18 months at sea. Early in the voyage <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> he could {{write a book about}} geology, and he showed a gift for theorising. At Punta Alta he made a major find of gigantic fossils of extinct mammals, then known from only a very few specimens. He ably collected and made detailed observations of plants and animals, with results that shook his belief that species were fixed and provided the basis for ideas which came to him when back in England, and led to his theory of evolution by natural selection.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Raymond's {{office had}} {{accepted}} {{a commission to}} design a dormitory for the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry, part of French India in southeast India. A preliminary site visit was made by George Nakashima and the schematic design was completed in 1936. Although Raymond had envisioned that the dormitory would be completed in six months, Sri Aurobindo was concerned that the noise of construction would disturb the ashram, so <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> the building would be constructed by its residents.|$|E

5|$|In February 1937, Agnew entered Johns Hopkins University as a {{chemistry}} major. After {{the first few}} months he found the pressure of the academic work increasingly stressful, and was distracted by the family's continuing financial problems and worries about the international situation, in which war seemed likely. In 1939 <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> his future lay in law rather than chemistry, left Johns Hopkins and began night classes at the University of Baltimore School of Law. To support himself, he took a day job as an insurance clerk with the Maryland Casualty Company.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century, Walmer Castle {{became the}} {{official}} {{residence of the}} Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. The Lord Warden was originally a medieval title linked to five key ports {{along the coast of}} England; the position's prominence had faded, but it still retained important judicial and military functions. When Lionel Sackville, the Duke of Dorset, was appointed to the post in 1708 <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> the existing residence in Dover Castle was unsatisfactory, probably because of the semi-ruinous state of the castle, and moved into Walmer Castle instead.|$|E
5|$|In the {{off-season}} Shero {{decided that the}} team would be more successful if he coached them like he had coached his minor league teams. Upon being elevated to the NHL, he {{had decided not to}} employ systems like he did in the minors, stating that he had too much respect for NHL players. However, <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> since he had the same kind of players on the Flyers as he did in the minors, he would use the same systems, becoming the first coach to employ systems.|$|E
50|$|Numair {{agrees to}} help the wolves, but <b>he</b> <b>decides</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> first must visit the nobles in Fief Dunlath at a party to further {{investigate}} after they find the burnt remains of the Ninth Rider Group.|$|R

5|$|Marcel Pagnol's 1953 film Manon des Sources {{was four}} hours long, and {{subsequently}} cut by its distributor. The end result left Pagnol dissatisfied, {{and led him}} to retell the story as a novel. The {{first part of the}} novel, titled Jean de Florette, was an exploration of the background for the film; a prequel of sorts. Together the two volumes made up the work Pagnol called L'Eau des collines (The Water of the Hills). Berri came across Pagnol's book by chance in a hotel room, and was captivated by it. <b>He</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> in order to do the story justice it had to be made in two parts.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Hadl {{learned that}} Tiger Electronics had {{licensed}} King Kong for a handheld game. <b>He</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> Universal's earnings from it were too low {{and that the}} license's granting of exclusive rights to Tiger would impede the agreement with Coleco. On May 4, Sheinberg sent Tiger a mailgram demanding that they send their game in for further approval. Universal reviewed it and decided that King Kong was too similar to Donkey Kong. On May 8, Steinberg revoked Tiger's license, but Tiger president O. R. Rissman refused to give in and challenged Universal's claim that it owned the King Kong name.|$|E
5|$|On July 11, 2012, the Los Angeles Lakers {{acquired}} Nash in a sign-and-trade {{deal with}} Phoenix. Nash also considered signing with New York or Toronto, but <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> Los Angeles {{was the best}} fit {{for him and his}} family. Nash switched his jersey number, as his customary No. 13 was retired by Los Angeles in honour of Wilt Chamberlain. Nash, an avid soccer fan, chose No. 10 to pay homage to Glenn Hoddle, Zinedine Zidane, Lionel Messi and other soccer playmakers who wore the number. Entering his 17th NBA season, Nash came to the Lakers with concerns over his defense and the health of his back.|$|E

5|$|When Dave Rosten, another Sydney evangelist, {{attempted}} to imitate Jenner's method of evangelism, he was {{punched in the}} midriff by the first person he spoke to, so <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> Jenner's approach to evangelism was not for others to emulate. In 1947, Jenner asked his question to a man named Angus Carruthers, who responded {{that he was a}} Christian and going to heaven. Jenner invited Carruthers back to his home, where Carruthers met Jenner's daughter, Ann. Carruthers and Ann married three years later.|$|E
5|$|A German {{officer who}} escaped {{reported}} that the German prisoners were being humanely treated, but when Böhme {{became aware of the}} situation, <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> retaliation was needed. He ordered III.Battalion of the 749th Infantry Regiment, part of the 717th Infantry Division, to burn down Gornji Milanovac and take hostages in order to expedite the recovery of the captured German troops. Due to a misunderstanding by the battalion commander, the unit did not burn down the town on 6October, and released the 170hostages it had arrested. Böhme was furious, and, on 15October, he sent the same battalion back to Gornji Milanovac to carry out his original orders. This was done on 16October.|$|E
5|$|After {{the rescue}} of Mussolini and the {{establishment}} of the Italian Social Republic (RSI), in spite of urging by local German officials, Hitler refused to officially annex South Tyrol, instead <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> the RSI should hold official sovereignty over these territories, and forbade all measures that would give the impression of official annexation of South Tyrol. However, in practice the territory of South Tyrol within the boundaries defined by Germany as Operationszone Alpenvorland that included Trent, Bolzano, and Belluno, were de facto incorporated into Germany's Reichsgau Tirol-Vorarlberg and administered by its Gauleiter Franz Hofer. While the region identified by Germany as Operationszone Adriatisches Küstenland that included Udine, Gorizia, Trieste, Pola, Fiume (Rijeka), and Ljubljana were de facto incorporated into Reichsgau Kärnten and administered by its Gauleiter Friedrich Rainer.|$|E

5|$|As Leader of the Opposition, Douglas-Home persuaded Macleod and Powell {{to rejoin}} the Conservative front bench. Within weeks of the general {{election}} Butler retired from politics, accepting the post of Master of Trinity College, Cambridge together with a life peerage. Douglas-Home did not immediately allocate shadow portfolios to his colleagues, but in January 1965 he gave Maudling the foreign affairs brief and Heath became spokesman on Treasury and economic affairs. There was no immediate pressure for Douglas-Home {{to hand over the}} leadership to a member of the younger generation, but by early 1965 a new Conservative group called PEST (Pressure for Economic and Social Toryism) had discreetly begun to call for a change. Douglas-Home either did not know, or chose to ignore, the fact that Heath had made a donation to PEST. <b>He</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> the time was coming for him to retire as leader, with Heath as his preferred successor.|$|E
5|$|By 1949 Swift was 35 years old, but {{was still}} {{performing}} well enough to maintain {{his place in the}} England team. However, <b>he</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> he wanted to retire while still capable of playing at the top level, rather than fading away. To this end he announced that he would retire {{at the end of the}} 1948–49 season. He made what he intended to be his last Manchester City appearance against Huddersfield Town on 7 May, which was followed by a parade in his honour organised by the Supporters' Club. However, just before the next season started, Swift's replacement Alec Thurlow fell ill with tuberculosis, and Swift agreed to step in until City found a new goalkeeper. Four further appearances took his career total to 338. Aware of attempts by other clubs to tempt Swift out of retirement, most notably by Manchester United, the Manchester City board continued to hold Swift's playing registration for several years.|$|E
5|$|Castellaneta started acting {{after his}} {{graduation}} from Northern Illinois University in 1979. <b>He</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> if his career went nowhere {{he would still}} have a chance to try something else. He began taking improvisation classes, where he met his future wife Deb Lacusta. Castellaneta started to work at The Second City, an improvisational theatre in Chicago, in 1983 and continued to work there until 1987. During this period, he did voice-over work with his wife for various radio stations. He auditioned for a role in The Tracey Ullman Show and his first meeting underwhelmed Tracey Ullman and the other producers. Ullman decided to fly to Chicago to watch Castellaneta perform. His performance that night was about a blind man who tries to become a comedian and Ullman later recalled that although there were flashier performances that night, Castellaneta made her cry. She was impressed and Castellaneta was hired.|$|E
