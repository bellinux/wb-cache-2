40|$|The sizing {{procedures}} adopted for {{the everyday}} design of electrical machines {{are well known}} and consolidated. However, for brushless <b>exciters</b> <b>of</b> field wound, synchronous generators, there is significant room for improvement as {{the impact of the}} diodes’ commutations in the rotating bridge rectifier are often neglected. This paper deals with the development of a fast analytical, genetic-algorithm-based design tool for the excitation systems of salient-pole, field wound synchronous generators. As vessel for this study, the <b>exciter</b> <b>of</b> a particular 400 kVAis considered. The proposed tool is focused on achieving exciter designs that minimize the voltage drop due to the commutation processes in the rotating diode rectifier, with minimum impact on the overall efficiency...|$|R

30|$|Another {{concern is}} the voltage stability. In ship power systems, voltage {{instability}} occurs when the <b>exciter</b> <b>of</b> the generators hits the limit and the generators cannot provide any more reactive power. Moreover, the predominant load is induction motors, which consume reactive power. When motors start from zero speed or when motors stall, the reactive power demand increases. Also, when the ship is reconfigured, the loading condition may change. In some cases, the loading condition may exceed the capability of the reactive power of the generators.|$|R

30|$|To design {{reliable}} VLC systems {{installed in}} various indoor environments, {{it is necessary}} to investigate the communication performance according to the space dimensions, number <b>of</b> <b>transmitters,</b> optical parameters in receivers, etc. For example, the effect of the number <b>of</b> <b>transmitters</b> on RMSDS is as follows. With large number <b>of</b> <b>transmitters,</b> the maximum RMSDS is decreased and the minimum RMSDS is increased. For reliable communications in a room, the minimum available DR over the entire receiving plane is also important. The maximum RMSDS <b>of</b> the single <b>transmitter</b> case is significantly affected by room dimension. On the contrary, the effect of room dimension on the maximum RMSDS becomes weak in the case of four-transmitter. The large number <b>of</b> <b>transmitters</b> relaxes the conditions for reliable communication with the room dimension change.|$|R

30|$|Figure 4 (a) {{shows the}} {{measured}} effective data rate. When the packet generation interval {{is less than}} 0.1 [*]s, as the number <b>of</b> <b>transmitters</b> increases, the effective data rate first grows and then decreases. The reason for this phenomenon is that as the number <b>of</b> <b>transmitters</b> increases, more packets are sent {{in the same time}} and traffic load increases; but overly-heavy traffic load leads to higher possibility of collision which causes the decrease of the effective data rate. On the other hand, when the interval is larger than 0.1 [*]s, although the number <b>of</b> <b>transmitters</b> increases, the traffic load is still very low. This is the reason why the effective data rate always keeps increasing as the number <b>of</b> <b>transmitters</b> increases.|$|R
30|$|Figure 6 (a) {{shows the}} {{measured}} effective data rate. We can observe {{that for the}} same number <b>of</b> <b>transmitters,</b> the effective data rate grows slowly as MinBE increases. Figure 6 (b) shows the measured packet loss rate, which decreases {{with the increase of}} MinBE and the number <b>of</b> <b>transmitters.</b> The reason for this may be that larger MinBE values imply larger backoff time, which cause the possibility of detecting an idle channel to increase. As a result, with the increase of MinBE, the effective data rate increases and the packet loss rate decrease for the same number <b>of</b> <b>transmitters.</b> Figure 6 (c) shows the measured end-to-end delay. At the same number <b>of</b> <b>transmitters,</b> the end-to-end delay grows with the increase of MinBE.|$|R
30|$|Figure 5 (a) {{shows the}} {{measured}} effective data rate, which grows for less (e.g., 4) transmitters as {{the value of}} MaxNB increase.

In Figure 5 (b), for the same number <b>of</b> <b>transmitters,</b> contrary to the effective date rate in Figure 5 (a), the packet loss rate decreases for less transmitters with the increase of MaxNB. But when the number <b>of</b> <b>transmitters</b> reaches a certain threshold, the situation becomes opposite.|$|R

50|$|Similar {{results were}} {{obtained}} by Pechony et al. who calculated Schumann resonance fields from satellite lightning data. It was assumed that the distribution of lightning in the satellite maps was a good proxy for Schumann excitations sources, even though satellite observations predominantly measure in-cloud lightning rather than the cloud-to-ground lightning that are the primary <b>exciters</b> <b>of</b> the resonances. Both simulations - those neglecting the day-night asymmetry, and those taking this asymmetry into account - showed the same Asia-America chimney ranking. On the other hand, some optical satellite and climatological lightning data suggest the South American thunderstorm center is stronger than the Asian center.|$|R
40|$|Curarized {{cutaneous}} pectoris nerve-muscle preparations from frogs were stimulated at 10 /s or at 2 /s {{for periods}} ranging from 20 min to 4 h. End plate potential were recorded intracellularly {{and used to}} estimate the quantity <b>of</b> <b>transmitter</b> secreted {{during the period of}} stimulation. At the ends of the periods of stimulation the preparations were either fixed for electron microscopy or treated with black widow spider venom to determine the quantities <b>of</b> <b>transmitter</b> remainind in the terminal. Horseradish peroxidase or dextran was added to the bathing solution and used as a tracer to detect the formation of vesicles from the axolemma. During 4 h of stimulation at 2 /s many new vesicles were formed from the axolemma and the quantity <b>of</b> <b>transmitter</b> secreted was several times greater than the quantity in the initial store. After this period of stimulation, the terminals were severely depleted <b>of</b> <b>transmitter,</b> but not <b>of</b> vesicles, and their general morphological organization was normal. During 20 min of stimulation at 10 /s the nerve terminals swelled and were severely depleted both of vesicles and <b>of</b> <b>transmitter.</b> During a subsequent hour of rest the changes in morphology were largely reversed, many new vesicles were formed from the axolemma and the stores <b>of</b> <b>transmitter</b> were partially replenished, These results suggest (a) that synaptic vesicles fuse with, and re-form from, the membrane of the nerve terminal during and after stimulation and (b), that the re-formed vesicles can store and release transmitter...|$|R

30|$|Figure 4 (c) {{shows the}} {{measured}} {{end to end}} delay. We can see that when the packet generation interval is less than 1 [*]s, the end-to-end delay grows significantly with increasing number <b>of</b> <b>transmitters.</b> The {{reason for this is}} that for smaller packet generation intervals, the traffic load grows significantly as the number <b>of</b> <b>transmitters</b> increases. As a result, the competition of channel access is fierce and more backoffs and retransmissions are needed. On the other hand, when the packet generation interval is 1 [*]s or 10 [*]s, the end-to-end delay is close to zero and changes hardly as the number <b>of</b> <b>transmitters</b> increases.|$|R
