5|$|In 1971 Matlock became Director of Soviet Affairs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Department.</b> During Richard Nixon's presidency, {{a period}} known as détente, {{there was a}} {{reduction}} of Cold War tension. Matlock participated in the negotiation of arms control treaties and other bilateral agreements.

5|$|In the post-election {{speculation}} as to {{who would}} be given office under McKinley, Hay's name figured prominently, as did that of Whitelaw Reid; both men sought high office <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Department,</b> either as secretary {{or one of the}} major ambassadorial posts. Reid, in addition to his vice-presidential run, had been Minister to France under Harrison. Reid, an asthmatic, handicapped himself by departing for Arizona Territory for the winter, leading to speculation about his health.|$|E
5|$|Kennan {{opposed the}} {{building}} of the hydrogen bomb and the rearmament of Germany, which were policies encouraged by the assumptions of NSC-68. During the Korean War (which began when North Korea invaded South Korea in June 1950), when rumors started circulating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Department</b> that plans were being made to advance beyond the 38th parallel into North Korea, an act that Kennan considered dangerous, he engaged in intense arguments with Assistant Secretary of State for the Far East Dean Rusk, who apparently endorsed Acheson's goal to forcibly unite the Koreas.|$|E
5|$|Laid down on 25 May 1910, Rivadavia was {{launched}} and christened on 26 August 1911 by Isabel, {{the wife of}} the Argentine Minister to the United States Rómulo Sebastián Naón.

5|$|President of the United States Gerald Ford {{approved}} covert aid to UNITA and the FNLA through Operation IA Feature on 18 July 1975, despite {{strong opposition}} from officials <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Department</b> and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

He granted an additional $8million on 27 July and another $25million in August.|$|E
5|$|War fever ran high, and by April, McKinley {{reported}} to Congress that efforts at diplomatic resolution had failed; a week later, Congress declared war. By this time, McKinley {{had begun to}} rely on Assistant Secretary of State William R. Day for day-to-day management of the State Department, and was even inviting him to cabinet meetings, as Sherman had stopped attending them. Day, a McKinley associate of long standing, superseded his boss as the real power <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Department.</b> Sherman, sensing {{that he was being}} made a mere figurehead and recognizing, at last, his declining health and worsening memory, resigned his office on April 25, 1898.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of détente, he was Director of Soviet Affairs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Department,</b> and began {{to participate in the}} summit meetings between the leaders, eventually attending {{all but one of the}} U.S. – Soviet summits held in the 20-year period 1972–91. Matlock was back in Moscow in 1974, serving in the number two position in the embassy for four years. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in early 1980 ended the period of reduced tensions. Matlock was assigned to Moscow again in 1981 as acting ambassador during the first part of Ronald Reagan's presidency. Reagan appointed him as ambassador to Czechoslovakia and later asked him to return to Washington in 1983 to work at the National Security Council, with the assignment to develop a negotiating strategy to end the arms race. When Mikhail Gorbachev became the leader of the Soviet Union in 1985, arms negotiations and summit meetings resumed. Matlock was appointed ambassador to the Soviet Union in 1987 and saw the last years of the Soviet Union before he retired from the Foreign Service in 1991.|$|E
50|$|On July 16, 2012, <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> of <b>State</b> {{announced}} her promotion to Deputy Assistant Secretary <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Department's</b> Western Hemisphere (WHA) Bureau, {{responsible for the}} Offices of Caribbean Affairs, Central American Affairs and Cuban Affairs.|$|R

50|$|In October 2012, Ambassador Warlick was {{appointed}} U.S.Consul General in Melbourne, Australia where she served until July 2014.

5|$|Harrison had {{developed}} {{his foreign policy}} based largely on Blaine’s ideas, and {{at the start of}} his term, Harrison and Blaine had very similar views on the United States' place in the world. In spite of their shared worldview, however, the two men became personally unfriendly as the term went on. Harrison was conscious that his Secretary of State was more popular than he, and while he admired Blaine’s gift for diplomacy, he grew displeased with Blaine’s frequent absence from his post because of illness, and suspected that Blaine was angling for the presidential nomination in 1892. Harrison tried to limit how many “Blaine men” filled subordinate positions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Department</b> and denied Blaine’s request that his son, Walker, be appointed First Assistant Secretary, instead naming him Solicitor of the Department of State. Despite the growing personal rancor, the two men continued, with one exception, to agree on the foreign policy questions of the day.|$|E
5|$|In Washington, Landis {{worked hard}} to protect Gresham's {{interests}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Department,</b> making friends with {{many members of the}} press. He was less popular among many of the Department's senior career officials, who saw him as brash. When word leaked concerning President Cleveland's Hawaiian policy, the President was convinced Landis was the source of the information and demanded his dismissal. Gresham defended Landis, stating that Cleveland would have to fire both of them, and the President relented, later finding out that he was mistaken in accusing Landis. President Cleveland grew to like Landis, and when Gresham died in 1895, offered Landis the post of United States Ambassador to Venezuela. Landis declined the diplomatic post, preferring to return to Chicago to begin a law practice and to marry Winifred Reed, daughter of the Ottawa, Illinois postmaster. The two married July 25, 1895; they had two surviving children, a boy, Reed, and a girl, Susanne—a third child, Winifred, died almost immediately after being born.|$|E
5|$|Initially, screenwriter Dan Sterling {{wrote his}} script {{based on a}} fake {{dictator}} from a fake country, but Rogen, Goldberg, and Sony executives asked him to rewrite the script focusing on Kim. The screenplay was then titled Kill Kim Jong Un. Previous iterations of the story revolved around Kim Jong-il, but put the project on hold until Jong-il died and his son Kim Jong-un assumed power in 2011. Development resumed when Rogen and Goldberg realized that Jong-un is closer to their own age, which they felt would be more humorous. To write the story, co-written with Daily Show writer Dan Sterling, they researched meticulously by reading non-fiction books and watching video footage about North Korea. The script was later reviewed by an employee <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Department.</b> Rogen and Goldberg aimed to make the project more relevant and satirical than their previous films while retaining toilet humor. They were pleased when former NBA star Dennis Rodman visited North Korea, as it reinforced their belief that {{the premise of the}} film was realistic.|$|E
50|$|After {{two years}} working <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Department's</b> office of European affairs, in 1959 Tibbetts joined {{the staff of}} the International Cooperation Administration and served a two-year stint.

Nixon then suggested the Federal Aviation Administration, and Butterfield agreed.|$|E

25|$|The United States Department of State {{approved}} a policy paper {{stating that the}} U.S. would not oppose restoration of French sovereignty in Indochina, but would seek {{to ensure that the}} French permitted the Indochinese peoples more autonomy. This new policy was a large step away from Roosevelt's previous opposition to the French, but, except for Asian experts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Department,</b> there was little support in the U.S. government for continuing to follow Roosevelt's policy.|$|E
25|$|In June 2009, Clinton {{had surgery}} to repair a right elbow {{fracture}} caused by a fall <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Department</b> basement.

25|$|Although U.S. officials, {{including}} persons {{stationed at}} the U.S. Embassy in Caracas, met with Venezuelan opposition leaders throughout this period, the U.S. government denied encouraging the coup, saying it insisted any change in government must take place through constitutional means.
