5|$|Some {{versions}} of the original Soulcalibur arcade game censored Ivy's default costume by covering <b>her</b> <b>bare</b> skin with a lavender catsuit. With Soulcalibur IV, Ivy's look on the promotional artwork was modified on the English website to hide her undercleavage, leading to suspicion of censorship in the American release of the game. When asked about the censoring, director Katsutoshi Sasaki stated he had heard of {{nothing of the sort}} having taken place. When released in North America it was shown that no actual censorship had occurred within the game.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{it being}} a simpler project due to the {{original}} art being reusable {{turned out to be}} untrue: because so much time had passed since the original's release, there were multiple parts that had to be reworked, leading to a process similar to creating a whole new game from scratch. All character graphics were redone, special effects were changed, and certain animations were added, such as sleeping animations. Some item placements were changed, the overall difficulty was adjusted, and some characters' battle statistics were altered; one such instance was making Kechi stronger than Oryu, due to it being perceived as illogical that a person with a sword would be weaker than a person fighting with <b>her</b> <b>bare</b> hands.|$|E
25|$|In Not Another Teen Movie, {{the nude}} foreign {{exchange}} student character Areola speaks lightly accented English, but her dialog is subtitled anyway. Also, {{the text is}} spaced {{in such a way}} that a view of <b>her</b> <b>bare</b> breasts is unhindered.|$|E

25|$|Psychic surgery, a pseudoscience constituting medical fraud, {{is when a}} {{practitioner}} creates the illusion of performing surgery with his or <b>her</b> <b>bare</b> hands and uses trickery, fake blood, and animal parts to convince the patient that the diseased lesions were removed and that the incision spontaneously healed.|$|E
25|$|In February 2013, Chi {{published}} the first photos of Catherine's exposed baby bump, taken during her vacation {{on the private}} island of Mustique. The British press refused to publish the paparazzi shots. While the Duchess was visiting the Blue Mountains in Sydney a picture was taken of <b>her</b> <b>bare</b> bottom as her dress blew up. Many newspapers outside the UK {{published the}} picture.|$|E

50|$|In June 2003 Schwartz {{became the}} subject of a stir in the Internet {{community}} when it was discovered that at least two cropped photographs of herself she had posted on her personal blog contained hidden Exif thumbnail images clearly showing <b>her</b> <b>bared</b> breasts, because the program she used to edit them, Photoshop, did not create replacement thumbnails.|$|R
25|$|Every day {{she begged}} {{to be able}} to enter a temple and become a nun instead of marrying. Her father {{eventually}} allowed her to work in the temple, but asked the monks to give her the toughest chores in order to discourage her. The monks forced Miaoshan to work all day and all night while others slept in order to finish her work. However, she was such a good person that the animals living around the temple began to help her with her chores. Her father, seeing this, became so frustrated that he attempted to burn down the temple. Miaoshan put out the fire with <b>her</b> <b>bare</b> hands and suffered no burns. Now struck with fear, her father ordered her to be put to death.|$|E
25|$|Still {{tied to the}} fence, Shepard {{was in a coma}} 18 {{hours after}} the attack when he was {{discovered}} by Aaron Kreifels, a cyclist who initially mistook Shepard for a scarecrow. Reggie Fluty, the first police officer to arrive at the scene, found Shepard alive but covered in blood. The medical gloves issued by the Albany County Sheriff's Department were faulty, and Fluty's supply ran out. She decided to use <b>her</b> <b>bare</b> hands to clear an airway in Shepard's bloody mouth. A day later, she was informed that Shepard was HIV positive, and she may have been exposed due to cuts on her hands. After taking an AZT regimen for several months, she tested negative for HIV. Judy Shepard later wrote she learned of her son's HIV status during his stay at the hospital following the attack.|$|E
25|$|One {{persistent}} rumor {{was especially}} prevalent in Europe; fake news circulated that Shirley {{was not a}} child but a 30-year-old dwarf {{due in part to}} her stocky body type. The rumor was so prevalent that the Vatican dispatched Father Silvio Massante to investigate if she were indeed a child. The fact that she never seemed to miss any teeth led some people to conclude that she had all her adult teeth. Temple was actually losing her teeth regularly through her days with 20th Century Fox, most notably during the sidewalk ceremony in front of Grauman's Theatre, where she took off her shoes and placed <b>her</b> <b>bare</b> feet in the cement to take attention away from her face. When acting, she wore dental plates and caps to hide the gaps in her teeth. Another rumor pertaining to her teeth was the idea that they were filed to make them appear like baby teeth.|$|E

25|$|Just {{before the}} 1930s, sun therapy became a popularly subscribed cure for almost every ailment from simple fatigue to tuberculosis. In the 1940s, {{advertisements}} started appearing in women’s magazines which encouraged sun bathing. At the same time, swimsuits' skin coverage began decreasing, with the bikini radically changing swimsuit style after {{it made its}} appearance in 1946. In the 1950s, many people used baby oil as a method to increase tanning. The first self-tanner came about in the same decade and was known as “Man-Tan,” although it often led to undesirable orange skin. Coppertone, in 1953, marketed its sunscreen with a drawing of a little blond girl and her cocker spaniel tugging on her bathing suit bottoms revealing <b>her</b> <b>bare</b> bottom and tan line; this advertisement was modified {{around the turn of}} the 21st century and now shows a little girl wearing a one-piece bathing suit or shorts. In the latter part of the 1950s, silver metallic reflectors were common to enhance one’s tan.|$|E
25|$|Brian {{would find}} himself saving his sister Betsy {{and the former}} Psi-Division of S.T.R.I.K.E. from his old enemy Slaymaster. He is also drafted by the {{mercenary}} group the Special Executive to save Saturnyne from a show trial, during which he witnessed the destruction of Earth-238's reality to prevent the Jaspers' Warp there from spreading out across the multiverse. He also encountered members of the pan-dimensional Captain Britain Corps, an organization of Captain Britains from various dimensions. However, he and his assembled allies were unable to prevent Earth-616's Jim Jaspers from expanding his influence over Earth, and though Brian fought bravely it fell to the Fury to kill the villain - Roma is of the opinion Merlyn intended all along for Brian to lead the Fury to Earth-616 to do this, but this was unconfirmed. Captain Britain also valiantly fights against the Fury, but although he comes close, is unable to best it. Now close to being killed by the Fury, Captain Britain is saved by Captain UK, {{a member of the}} Captain Britain Corps and on whose world the Fury killed all superheroes, including Captain UK's husband. Just as the Fury is about to land the killing blow on Captain Britain, Captain UK attacks it in a primal rage, tearing the Fury apart with <b>her</b> <b>bare</b> hands.|$|E
25|$|In Mortal Kombat, the 2011 reboot of the series, Jade {{was born}} into Edenian royalty that served Shao Kahn after he conquered the realm, and as a child she was given {{to him as a}} tribute. After years of {{rigorous}} training and service as an Outworld assassin, Jade earned a reputation as an agile and stealthy warrior. She was awarded the position of bodyguard to Princess Kitana and the two became close friends, but similar to her UMK3 storyline, Jade was under orders to kill Kitana should Kitana become disloyal to Kahn. Jade features in a chapter in the game's story mode, in which her self-assured and sassy personality stands in contrast to Kitana, who struggles to fulfill Kahn's expectations and begins doubting her origins. They initially fight against the Earthrealm warriors, but Jade soon becomes suspicious of Kitana when Kitana attempts to discover her true heritage, which in turn leads to her capture when she confronts Kahn after coming across a grotesque clone of herself named Mileena. Jade switches her allegiance and helps the Earthrealm warriors to free Kitana from captivity. She later joins them as they prepare to fend off Kahn's invasion of Earthrealm. As Raiden and Liu Kang commune with the Elder Gods, the Lin Kuei and Sindel attack. Sindel violently disembowels Jade with <b>her</b> <b>bare</b> hands, killing her. She is then resurrected and enslaved in the Netherealm by Quan Chi.|$|E
60|$|Her {{eyes seemed}} {{suddenly}} to leap {{up to his}} with that strange look of awakening and enthusiasm which he had noted before. And in its complete prepossession of all her instincts she rose from the bed, unheeding <b>her</b> <b>bared</b> arms and shoulders and loosened hair, and stood upright before him. For an instant husband and wife regarded each other as unreservedly as in their own chamber at Robles.|$|R

500|$|A public announcement, {{posted on}} July 12, 2013, {{revealed}} {{plans for an}} ArtRave event {{the night before the}} release of Artpop, unveiling projects Gaga had been working on in collaboration with the Haus of Gaga, Dutch photographer duo Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin, avant-garde theater director Robert Wilson, performance artist Marina Abramović, and Koons. The announcement featured Gaga covering <b>her</b> <b>bare</b> breasts with her arms, with her forearm [...] "Artpop" [...] tattoo in plain sight, wearing a visor designed by London College of Fashion alumna Isabell Yalda Hellysaz.

500|$|In a Japanese-style commercial, {{with both}} Japanese and English texts, {{she plays a}} Barbie-like doll with pink hair. Each scene ends with Lee crying. During the bridge, two girls in an {{elevator}} are seen laughing at the model's appearance, stating that she looks much older than they thought she was. Next scene, she is shown in a bathtub singing the song to herself. Another segment shows her breaking a mirror with <b>her</b> <b>bare</b> hand, which starts to bleed uncontrollably. In the final scene, she stands {{on the balcony of}} a building, crying and screaming at a billboard featuring one of her advertisements, saying that the model side of her isn't [...] "real and you can't save me", and that the public is oblivious to how she really lives.|$|E
500|$|In late 2010 as the Jets were {{preparing}} for the playoffs, a foot fetish video of woman appearing to be Ryan's wife Michelle surfaced on various internet outlets. The video features a clothed Michelle having <b>her</b> <b>bare</b> feet handled and commented on by an unseen camera operator with a voice similar to Rex's. The Jets released a press statement saying that Ryan and the organization considered the situation a private matter and would provide no comment. Multiple media reports soon linked the Ryans to a user profile named [...] "ihaveprettyfeet" [...] on a site for alternative sexual lifestyles, and more videos of Michelle emerged in the following months. In September 2015, a photo of Ryan surfaced of him {{sitting at his desk}} with a framed photo of a person's feet behind him.|$|E

All they can muster on short notice is a polka band and a large cake with Fonzie on it—gifts that were intended to celebrate janitor Jadwiga's birthday. She proceeds to ruin the TGS goodnights and tear into the cake with <b>her</b> <b>bare</b> hands. In Jack's office, Liz and Jack share a drink as Liz's birthday wish. In the final scene, as Jack takes a drink, the program reverts to a pre-recorded segment and Jack says, [...] "That's more like it." [...] The episode ends with a live goodnight from the TGS stage by the cast of the episode, a la Saturday Night Live.|$|E

500|$|In [...] "Cautionary Tales", Elle {{comes back}} to the United States. Former Company {{employee}} Noah Bennet captures Elle for collateral, as Bob had captured his daughter, Claire. He ties Elle's hands to a chair and ties <b>her</b> <b>bare</b> feet together and puts them in a metal dog bath which is full with water. Elle tries to use her abilities while in the dog bath, but she shocks herself. During this time, Noah tells Elle that Bob allowed the Company to perform tests on her which had begun as early as the age of seven. This included subjecting her to high doses of electricity, which scarred her emotionally for life. Elle has no recollection of the tests, and Noah suggests the Haitian had a role in causing Elle to forget her experiences. After an agreement is made, she is reunited with Bob and Claire momentarily reunited with Noah. However, Elle attacks Claire and West as they leave. She tries to attack Noah, but he shoots Elle in the arm before she can hurt him or anyone else. As it seems Noah is going to kill Bob, Mohinder Suresh, a scientist working with Noah and the Company, shoots and kills Noah. Elle leaves with Bob and Mohinder, giving Bob a look of distrust.|$|E
