25|$|After passing {{under the}} Robin Hood Line, which runs from Worksop to Nottingham, the county border leaves the river, which {{continues}} in a north-easterly direction. Beyond the B6407 Sookholme Road bridge, it is joined by The Bottoms, which rises in Mansfield Woodhouse and flows northwards to the junction. The freight line to Shirebrook crosses the river, and also crosses Sookholme Brook, which has two sources near Shirebrook, and after they have joined, flows parallel to the Meden to its junction near Warsop Vale. The river passes between Church Warsop and Market Warsop, where it is crossed by the A60 road. Just below the bridge is Warsop watermill, much of which dates from 1767. The building is grade II listed, and internally, the machinery and rolling mill date from the nineteenth century. There is also an early twentieth century water turbine. The mill bridge and weir are also listed structures. Turning eastwards, the river passes through Budby and into Thoresby Park, {{where it has been}} dammed to form a large ornamental lake called Thoresby Lake. The difference in height between the lake and the river below it at the eastern end was sufficient for Earl Manvers, the owner of Thoresby Hall, to install two water turbines in 1941. They were supplied by Newtons of Derby and were of 22 kVA and 5 kVA capacity. The electricity generated supplied the hall. The <b>generator</b> <b>house</b> was demolished in the late 20th century.|$|E

[...] Harry and Olive worked hard to make the farm a comfortable place to live. They raised pigs, cows and chickens. [...] The family grew vegetables in their garden, and planted large flower beds. [...] When the family decided they wanted electric lights, Harry converted a smokehouse into a power <b>generator</b> <b>house.</b> [...] Harry also built a play house for his three young daughters; and when the girls were older, he constructed a concrete swimming pool, feed by farm’s irrigation system.|$|E
